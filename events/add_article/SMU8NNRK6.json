      "summary": "Walmart and Target have begun removing price tags from items, a move linked to anticipated tariff‑driven price increases. Employees have posted videos showing them ripping off tags to reprice goods more quickly, while both chains say the change is part of a new labeling process. Walmart confirmed the policy shift and noted rising costs from tariffs, while Target has not publicly responded. The practice has sparked customer frustration and raised questions about transparency and pricing strategy amid ongoing trade tensions.",
