  "title": "US demands cut of Nvidia sales in order to ship AI chips to China",
  "description": "A \u201chighly unusual\u201d deal.",
  "content": "is a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nThe Trump administration has ordered Nvidia and AMD to pay the federal government a 15 percent cut of their AI chip sales revenue to China, according to reports from The New York Times and The Financial Times. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reportedly reached an agreement with President Donald Trump just days before the Commerce Department granted the companies licenses to sell AI chips.\n\nThe approved shipments include Nvidia\u2019s H20 and AMD\u2019s MI308, both of which are stripped-down versions of their AI-focused GPUs, designed to comply with US export rules to China. After the Trump administration put restrictions on AI chip sales to China in April, both companies confirmed last month that they would soon resume shipments once they received licenses. Nvidia\u2019s H20 chip came under fire last week after the Chinese government raised concerns that its chips could have a government \u201cbackdoor.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s deal with Nvidia and AMD could net the US government $2 billion per year, according to the New York Times. The Times calls the agreement \u201chighly unusual,\u201d a running theme for an administration that\u2019s taken in money from meme coin dinners, lawsuits against universities, shakedowns of TV networks, and a flood of unpredictable tariffs. Last week, Trump threatened to impose a 100 percent tariff on semiconductors unless companies reach a deal to bring manufacturing to the US.\n\nPresident Trump said earlier this year that he weighed breaking up Nvidia before Huang embarked on a campaign of flattery, which ended up also winning the removal of AI chip export limits. Trump has inserted himself into other major business dealings in the name of national security, proposing a joint venture that would give the US government 50 percent ownership of TikTok and recently demanding the resignation of Intel\u2019s new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, over his connections to China.\n\nFollow topics and authors from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.",

      "text": "President Donald Trump recently announced that he would host a private dinner for the top 220 biggest holders of $TRUMP, the meme coin he launched days prior to taking office \u2013 and several U.S. Senators would like to know exactly why he\u2019s doing this.\nThe dinner was publicly advertised on the $TRUMP coin homepage this past Wednesday, and included a special VIP package for the top 25 holders: a private reception with Trump, and a VIP tour of the White House the next day. According to the site, the winners will be determined by how much of the coin a contestant owns, as well as how long they hold it between April 23rd and May 12. \u201cThe more $TRUMP you hold \u2014 and the longer you hold it \u2014 the higher Your Ranking will be,\u201d it said.\nAt its peak, a $TRUMP token went for $75.35 on January 19th, the day before his inauguration. It has plummeted ever since, losing 88 percent of its value, and sat at $9.18 before the contest was announced. The promotion caused $TRUMP to jump by more than 50 percent, according to CBS, hitting a peak of $14.32 that afternoon and bringing in an extra $100 million in value.\nDemocrat Senators were outraged, with Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) posting on X that this was \u201cthe most brazenly corrupt thing a President has ever done.\u201d In a letter obtained by CNBC, Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Adam Schiff (D-CA) requested that the U.S. Office of Ethics open a probe into the President\u2019s actions, noting that the dinner could indicate that Trump and his officials \u201cmay be engaging in \u2018pay to play\u2019 corruption by selling presidential access to individuals or entities, to include foreign nationals and corporate actors with vested interests in federal action, while personally enriching the President and his family,\u201d the senators wrote.\nThe likelihood of an investigation, however, is slim.: Republicans have control of both chambers of Congress, and in February, Trump fired the director of the Office of Ethics, who had just been confirmed by the Senate to serve a five-year term.\nTrump has tightly embraced the crypto world over the past several years, courting the community during his second presidential race as well as appointing David Sacks as \u201ccrypto czar\u201d to shape policy around virtual currency, establishing a \u201cBitcoin Strategic Reserve,\u201d and crucially, eliminating the unit at the Justice Department that prosecutes crypto fraud. In return, crypto companies have donated millions of dollars to Trump\u2019s campaign and inauguration committee.\nMost Popular\n- Sex is getting scrubbed from the internet, but a billionaire can sell you AI nudes\n- Ditching my phone for an LTE smartwatch was a humbling experience\n- RFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American \u2014 that future\u2019s not as healthy as he thinks\n- We found stuff AI is pretty good at\n- Grok\u2019s \u2018spicy\u2019 video setting instantly made me Taylor Swift nude deepfakes"

      "text": "Columbia University announced on Wednesday that it has reached a deal with the Trump administration following months of negotiation to restore federal funding to the school, in a move described by the administration as a \u201cseismic shift\u201d in its fight with elite higher education.\nUnder the terms of the deal to resolve several federal probes into allegations that it had violated anti-discrimination laws, Columbia did not admit to wrongdoing but agreed to pay the government a $200 million settlement over three years and an additional $21 million to settle US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigations.\nIn exchange, the university said in its statement, \u201ca vast majority of the federal grants which were terminated or paused in March 2025 \u2014 will be reinstated and Columbia\u2019s access to billions of dollars in current and future grants will be restored.\u201d\nColumbia said the agreement also codifies policy changes it announced in March following the revocation of $400 million in federal funding over campus protests, including restrictions on demonstrations, new disciplinary procedures and immediately reviewing its Middle East curriculum.\n\u201cWhile Columbia does not admit to wrongdoing with this resolution agreement, the institution\u2019s leaders have recognized, repeatedly, that Jewish students and faculty have experienced painful, unacceptable incidents, and that reform was and is needed,\u201d the university said.\nAn independent monitor will oversee the agreement\u2019s implementation.\n\u201cThe settlement was carefully crafted to protect the values that define us and allow our essential research partnership with the federal government to get back on track,\u201d acting university President Claire Shipman said in a statement. \u201cImportantly, it safeguards our independence, a critical condition for academic excellence and scholarly exploration, work that is vital to the public interest.\u201d\nStill, the university has agreed to provide the Trump administration with access to \u201call relevant data and information to rigorously assess compliance with its commitment to merit-based hiring and admissions,\u201d a senior White House official said.\nThe agreement, the official added, \u201cmandates a comprehensive review of Columbia\u2019s portfolio of programs in regional areas, starting with those relating to the Middle East.\u201d\nAnd the school agreed to review its admissions process and \u201cstrengthen oversight of international students,\u201d according to the official. Columbia will \u201cassess applicants\u2019 reasons for wishing to study in the U.S., sharing relevant data with the Federal Government,\u201d the official said.\nPresident Donald Trump celebrated the agreement in a post on Truth Social Wednesday evening, where he thanked Education Secretary Linda McMahon for her work on the deal and commended Columbia \u201cfor agreeing to do what is right.\u201d\n\u201cNumerous other Higher Education Institutions that have hurt so many, and been so unfair and unjust, and have wrongly spent federal money, much of it from our government, are upcoming,\u201d he added.\nColumbia faced financial headwinds\nShipman noted in a message to the Columbia community on Wednesday evening that the financial pressures on the school extended beyond the $400 million funding freeze.\n\u201cWe have seen not only $400 million in federal grants frozen, but also the majority of our $1.3 billion a year in federal funding placed on hold. The prospect of that continuing indefinitely, along with the potential loss of top scientists, would jeopardize our status as a world-leading research institution,\u201d she said in the letter.\nIn her first interview since the deal was announced, Shipman framed the federal funding freeze as an existential threat to the university that needed to be resolved, saying finding an agreement with the White House was the \u201cresponsible path.\u201d\n\u201cThis resolution is really going to allow us to turn a page on a period of deep instability for our institution,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan Thursday.\nShipman defended the school from accusations that it capitulated to the Trump administration.\n\u201cThe narrative that paints this as a kind of binary situation, courage versus capitulation, is just wrong. It\u2019s too simplistic. This was a really, really complex problem, and I will argue over and over again that choosing to listen, choosing to try to solve the problem with everything that we had at stake is not capitulation. It was extraordinarily difficult,\u201d Shipman said.\nShipman said her team weighed the possibility of taking the Trump administration to court but determined that the threat of long-term damage was too severe.\n\u201cWe did carefully at that, and we saw we could have some short-term victories, but we worried we would have long term damage. For example, we could have faced the loss of any future relationship in the coming years with the federal government, and that would have effectively meant an end to the research mission we conduct as we know it,\u201d she said.\nThe acting president cast the agreement as a \u201creset\u201d for Columbia\u2019s relationship with the federal government, describing \u201cdeep deliberation and almost word-by-word negotiation\u201d with the White House over months \u2013 a process that, she said, \u201ctook longer than anticipated.\u201d\nLast month, Shipman described the financial pressures that university was facing because of the administration\u2019s campaign as \u201cincreasingly acute.\u201d\n\u201cColumbia\u2019s top scientists are facing the decimation of decades of research. Graduate students, postdocs, mid-career researchers, and established, celebrated scientists, have all had their breakthroughs lauded by the world one minute and defunded the next. We\u2019re in danger of reaching a tipping point in terms of preserving our research excellence and the work we do for humanity,\u201d Shipman said.\n\u2018Roadmap for elite universities\u2019\nThe Trump administration believes that the deal could serve as a blueprint for other schools.\nMcMahon heralded the outcome as a \u201cseismic shift in our nation\u2019s fight to hold institutions that accept American taxpayer dollars accountable for antisemitic discrimination and harassment\u201d and said the school\u2019s reforms mark \u201ca roadmap for elite universities that wish to regain the confidence of the American public by renewing their commitment to truth-seeking, merit, and civil debate.\u201d\n\u201cI believe they will ripple across the higher education sector and change the course of campus culture for years to come,\u201d McMahon said.\nElite schools like Columbia and Harvard University, among others, have faced intense pressure from the Trump administration to crack down on antisemitism on their campuses \u2013 or face the possible loss of significant federal funding. The effort is part of a broad administration push for policy changes at universities \u2013 including over Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and other initiatives \u2013 that Trump sees as a winning political issue. But it is one that raises major questions about academic freedom and the role of the federal government on college campuses.\nThe White House official touted the $21 million settlement of US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigations as \u201cthe largest employment-discrimination public settlement in almost 20 years.\u201d That money, according to the official, will \u201cresolve alleged civil rights violations against Jewish Columbia employees that occurred on its campus following the October 7, 2023, Hamas terror attacks.\u201d\nThe $200 million will go to the US Treasury, a senior administration official told CNN on Thursday.\nPressed for specifics, the official said, \u201cThis is money that is going to be sort of residing in the US Treasury, but there would need to be a specific appropriation in order to, like, spend it on something,\u201d later adding that the policy focus for the money would be on trade schools and apprenticeships.\nCNN reported last month that the administration was nearing an agreement with Columbia, and the school\u2019s board met in early July to review the terms of the deal, according to a source familiar with the process.\nThe university, which was facing an investigation into its handling of antisemitism on campus, had taken a less confrontational approach than Harvard while it sought to reach a deal, and a source familiar with the matter told CNN that the administration was more amenable to Columbia\u2019s proposed terms in behind-the-scenes negotiations. In June, the Trump administration threatened to pull the university\u2019s accreditation over policies it said violated discrimination laws, the source said.\nAsked about the state of talks, Trump told CNN earlier this month, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to probably settle with Harvard. We\u2019re going to probably settle with Columbia. They want to settle very badly. There\u2019s no rush.\u201d\nAsked how much money the settlement would entail, Trump said, \u201cA lot of money.\u201d\nA source involved in universities\u2019 response to the administration told CNN last month that the White House has been looking to strike a deal with a high-profile school.\n\u201cThey want a name-brand university to make a deal like the law firms made a deal that covers not just antisemitism and protests, but DEI and intellectual diversity,\u201d this person said at the time.\nAsked if any of the schools are inclined to make such a deal, the source said, \u201cNobody wants to be the first, but the financial pressures are getting real.\u201d\nThe settlement was met with support from the school\u2019s Hillel.\n\u201cThis announcement is an important recognition of what Jewish students and their families have expressed with increasing urgency: antisemitism at Columbia is real, and it has had a tangible impact on Jewish students\u2019 sense of safety and belonging and, in turn, their civil rights. Acknowledging this fact is essential, and along with the new path laid out by the President and Trustees, I am hopeful that today\u2019s agreement marks the beginning of real, sustained change,\u201d Brian Cohen, executive director of Columbia/Barnard Hillel, said.\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

      "text": "Nvidia\u2019s efforts to suck up to the Trump administration have seemingly paid off, with the US now lifting export limits on US-made AI chips and cracking down on anyone using Huawei\u2019s emerging alternatives. The announcements come as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang joined President Trump in Saudi Arabia this week to solicit AI investments for US companies.\nThe US Department of Commerce (DOC) announced on Monday that it has rescinded the Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule, due to take effect on May 15th, that aimed to restrict how many US-made AI chips could be sent to international markets without special government approval. The DOC said that a replacement rule for protecting US AI technology will be issued \u201cin the future,\u201d but provided no specific details.\n\u201cThese new requirements would have stifled American innovation and saddled companies with burdensome new regulatory requirements,\u201d The DOC said in a statement. \u201cThe AI Diffusion Rule also would have undermined US diplomatic relations with dozens of countries by downgrading them to second-tier status.\u201d\nWhile the goal was to prevent countries already subject to chip restrictions, such as Russia and China, from accessing or building AI tech, it also placed Nvidia\u2019s estimated 90 percent share of the AI chip market in jeopardy. Shortly after the Diffusion Rule was introduced by former President Joe Biden in January, Nvidia issued a statement calling it \u201cmisguided,\u201d while anticipating a return to Trump\u2019s first term policies \u201cthat strengthen American leadership, bolster our economy and preserve our competitive edge in AI and beyond.\u201d\nThe DOC also warned companies that using Huawei\u2019s Ascend AI chipset \u201canywhere in the world\u201d would violate US export control agreements. Huawei\u2019s home-grown Ascend processors are seen as China\u2019s best answer to Nvidia\u2019s powerful AI chips.\nNvidia\u2019s Huang was notably one of the only US tech leaders to not attend Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. His absence doesn\u2019t appear to have soured the relationship between them, however, with Huang spotted cosying up to Trump at a US-Saudi investment summit in Riyadh on Tuesday, alongside other tech leaders like Elon Musk, AMD\u2019s Lisa Su, OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman, and Epic CEO Tim Sweeney.\nThe Washington Post reports that Trump was far from subtle about what the US wanted from the gathering. \u201cAs you know, we have the biggest business leaders in the world here,\u201d he told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. \u201cThey\u2019re going to walk away with a lot of checks for a lot of things that you\u2019re going to provide.\u201d\nMost Popular\n- Reddit will block the Internet Archive\n- GitHub just got less independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\n- RFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American \u2014 that future\u2019s not as healthy as he thinks\n- Ford reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs\n- Hyundai wants Ioniq 5 owners to pay to fix a keyless entry security hole"

He is due to remain on air until May, and declared on Monday that \u201cthe gloves are off\u201d.\nSkydance was founded in 2010 by David Ellison, son of the tech billionaire Larry Ellison, co-founder of Oracle, and an ally of Trump.\nThe $16m settlement was already seen by critics as a further example of capitulation by media companies hoping to smooth the waters with the US president. ABC News, ultimately owned by Disney, also agreed to pay $15m to settle a defamation lawsuit over its coverage.\nAfter Trump\u2019s latest claim regarding $20m worth of advertising and programming from Paramount, the Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter: \u201cThis reeks of corruption.\u201d"

Is he finally going through with that plan? Trump just announced he\u2019ll putting an enormous 100 percent tariff on chips and semiconductors \u2014 unless your company kisses the ring like Apple CEO Tim Cook just did, perhaps.\nTrump threatens 100 percent tariff on computer chips with a gigantic loophole\n\u2018If you\u2019ve made a commitment to build or you\u2019re in the process of building, as many are, there is no tariff, OK?\u2019\nIn the same live news conference where Apple announced a new $100 billion US manufacturing plan and presented Trump with a 24-karat gold and glass statue, the president explained that Apple had now done enough to escape his upcoming import taxes on chips:\nWe\u2019re going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors, but the good news for companies like Apple is if you\u2019re building in the United States or have committed to build without question in the United States, there will be no charge.\nAnd, it\u2019s possible that other companies already have, or easily will, meet Trump\u2019s bar for participation. Trump told the in-person and online audience that even a commitment to invest in US manufacturing may be enough to escape the tariffs. \u201c[If you\u2019re building in the United States of America, there\u2019s no charge, even though you\u2019re building and not producing yet,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve made a commitment to build or you\u2019re in the process of building, as many are, there is no tariff, OK?\u201d\nHere\u2019s our transcript of Trump\u2019s full remarks on the topic:\nWe\u2019ll be putting a tariff on of approximately 100 percent, on chips and semiconductors. But if you\u2019re building in the United States of America, there\u2019s no charge, even though you\u2019re building and not producing yet, in terms of the big numbers of jobs and all of the things that you\u2019re building. If you\u2019re building there will be no charge [\u2026] 100 percent tariff on all chips and semiconductors coming into the United States, but if you\u2019ve made a commitment to build or you\u2019re in the process of building, as many are, there is no tariff, OK? If for some reason you say you\u2019re building and you don\u2019t build then we go back and add it up, it accumulates and we charge you at a later date. You have to pay, and that\u2019s a guarantee.\nIt\u2019s hard to think which companies a new chip tariff would apply to, as most major chipmakers already have at least some small commitment to US manufacturing. Taiwan\u2019s TSMC, which accounts for the vast majority of leading-edge chips and drew Trump\u2019s ire as a result, announced a $100 billion US investment back in March.\nOr, perhaps, is Trump threatening tariffs on the makers of products that use chips rather than the makers of chips themselves? Apple isn\u2019t exactly a chipmaker, after all; it does design its own chips but relies on companies like TSMC to actually make them.\nIt\u2019s also possible that Trump won\u2019t enact this particular tariff at all. After previously threatening tariffs on chips in January and February, the Trump administration excluded them from tariffs come April. Trump did not say when new chip tariffs might happen. Trump\u2019s new general reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries go into effect tomorrow, August 7th.\nIn July, AMD CEO Lisa Su revealed that TSMC\u2019s US-made chips would cost it an extra 5 to 20 percent more than ones made overseas.\nMost Popular\n- Reddit will block the Internet Archive\n- GitHub just got less independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\n- RFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American \u2014 that future\u2019s not as healthy as he thinks\n- Ford reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs\n- Hyundai wants Ioniq 5 owners to pay to fix a keyless entry security hole"

      "text": "At a victory rally the day before being sworn into the presidency, Donald Trump extolled his plan to \u201csave TikTok\u201d from the law that banned it through a joint venture with the US.\nOn its face, the plan does not appear to comply with the law\u2019s requirements for a qualified divestiture that TikTok\u2019s service providers like Apple, Google, and Oracle could rely on to avoid hundreds of billions in potential fines. Even so, at least some of TikTok\u2019s service providers seem to be relying on Trump\u2019s flimsy promises, allowing TikTok to restore service to the app mid-day Sunday, on the first day of its ban.\nTrump is proposing a joint venture where the US government owns 50 percent of TikTok. That raises a host of its own First Amendment issues since any content moderation whatsoever might be considered a government act, and the Constitution prohibits the government (not private companies) from infringing on speech.\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear how Trump envisions this all playing out, but Trump says, essentially, that TikTok would have a \u201cpartner\u201d in the US government, \u201cand they\u2019ll have a lot of bidders and the United States will do what we call a joint venture.\u201d Trump claims there is \u201cno risk\u201d to the US because \u201cwe\u2019re not putting up any money. All we\u2019re doing is giving them the approval without which they don\u2019t have anything. So, I don\u2019t know, it sounds like that works.\u201d\nTrump also reinforced the idea that the whole reason he likes TikTok is because he thinks it helped his campaign. He credited his 21-year-old staffer, nicknamed \u201cTikTok Jack,\u201d for helping him get on the app that helped him win over young voters.\nAnd though the stated purpose of forcing TikTok to divest from its parent company ByteDance (a move Trump himself first tried to do in his first term) was to remove a possible backdoor for the Chinese government to US data, he now says that \u201cfrankly, we have no choice, we have to save it \u2014 a lot of jobs. We don\u2019t wanna give our business to China.\u201d\nHere\u2019s Trump\u2019s full comments on TikTok during the rally:\nAnd as of today, TikTok is back. So, you know, I did a little TikTok thing we have a guy, TikTok Jack he\u2019s a young kid, like 21 years old. And we hired this guy, and I went on TikTok; can you believe what I\u2019ll do to win an election?And we went on TikTok and Republicans have never won the young vote, the youth vote. They win a lot of votes, but they never won the youth vote. We won the youth vote by 36 points. So I like TikTok. I like it. I had a slightly good experience wouldn\u2019t you say?\nRomney lost it by 40 points not so long ago. We won it by 36 points. That\u2019s a very big spread.But I said, we need to save TikTok, because we\u2019re talking about a tremendous \u2014 who, who in this audience goes with TikTok? Many? Yeah, very popular. And frankly, we have no choice, we have to save it \u2014 a lot of jobs. We don\u2019t wanna give our business to China, we don\u2019t wanna give our business to other people. And I said, you know, TikTok without my approval \u2014 meaning the president\u2019s approval because Congress gave the president the right to make a deal to whatever he wants and uh\u2026 they did that a long time ago when they have a different president. They didn\u2019t know that I was gonna be at the president, I guess.\nSo I said very simply, a joint venture. So, if TikTok is worth nothing, zero without an approval, you know you don\u2019t approve, they\u2019re out of business, they\u2019re worth nothing.\nIf you do approve, they\u2019re worth like a trillion dollars, they\u2019re worth some crazy number. So I said, I\u2019ll approve, but let the United States of America own 50% of TikTok.I\u2019m approving on behalf of the United States.\nSo they\u2019ll have a partner, the United States, and they\u2019ll have a lot of bidders and the United States will do what we call a joint venture. And there\u2019s no risk, we\u2019re not putting up any money. All we\u2019re doing is giving them the approval without which they don\u2019t have anything. So, I don\u2019t know, it sounds like that works. What do you think, good? So, whether you like TikTok or not, we\u2019re gonna make a lot of money.\nMost Popular\n- Reddit will block the Internet Archive\n- GitHub just got less independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\n- RFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American \u2014 that future\u2019s not as healthy as he thinks\n- Ford reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs\n- Hyundai wants Ioniq 5 owners to pay to fix a keyless entry security hole"

Last year\u2019s restrictions meant the US-based company couldn\u2019t sell the H100 to China, so it introduced a lower-specced H800 that could get around the US\u2019s rules \u2014 but with the new rules, Nvidia won\u2019t be able to sell that chip or its A800 chip to China, CNBC reports.\nThese new restrictions \u201care necessary to maintain the effectiveness of these controls, close loopholes, and ensure they remain durable,\u201d according to a press release from the Department of Commerce.\n\u201cToday\u2019s updated rules will increase effectiveness of our controls and further shut off pathways to evade our restrictions,\u201d Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a statement. \u201cThese controls maintain our clear focus on military applications and confront the threats to our national security posed by the PRC Government\u2019s military-civil fusion strategy.\u201d You can see details of the rules on the Bureau of Industry and Security\u2019s website.\nChips designed for artificial intelligence are in high demand as companies throw massive amounts of resources at new AI hardware and software products.\nIn a statement, Nvidia said that it\u2019s not too worried about the restrictions affecting its business. \u201cWe comply with all applicable regulations while working to provide products that support thousands of applications across many different industries,\u201d said Nvidia spokesperson Ken Brown. \u201cGiven the demand worldwide for our products, we don\u2019t expect a near-term meaningful impact on our financial results.\u201d The company also published an 8-K detailing some of the ways the rules are expected to impact the company.\nIntel spokesperson Sarah Keller said the company is \u201creviewing the rules and assessing the potential impact.\u201d AMD didn\u2019t immediately reply to a request for comment.\nThe Semiconductor Industry Association is \u201cevaluating the impact of the updated export controls on the U.S. semiconductor industry,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cWe recognize the need to protect national security and believe maintaining a healthy U.S. semiconductor industry is an essential component to achieving that goal. Overly broad, unilateral controls risk harming the U.S. semiconductor ecosystem without advancing national security as they encourage overseas customers to look elsewhere. Accordingly, we urge the administration to strengthen coordination with allies to ensure a level playing field for all companies.\u201d\n\u201cWe have made our position clear on US restrictions of chip exports to China,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said in a press conference on Monday. (Reuters had reported on the at-the-time forthcoming changes.) \u201cThe US needs to stop politicizing and weaponizing trade and tech issues and stop destabilizing global industrial and supply chains. We will closely follow the developments and firmly safeguard our rights and interests.\u201d\nThe announcement of the new rules followed Apple CEO Tim Cook\u2019s recent visit to a Chinese Apple Store hosting a tournament for the popular Tencent mobile game Honor of Kings.

      "text": "Nvidia\u2019s chief security officer has published a blog post insisting that its GPUs \u201cdo not and should not have kill switches and backdoors.\u201d It comes amid pressure from both sides of the Pacific, with some US lawmakers pushing Nvidia to grant the government backdoors to AI chips, while Chinese officials have alleged that they already exist.\nDavid Reber Jr.\u2019s post seems pointedly directed at US lawmakers. In May a bipartisan group introduced the Chip Security Act, a bill that would require Nvidia and other manufacturers to include tracking technology to identify when chips are illegally transported internationally, and leaves the door open for further security measures including remote kill switches. While Nvidia is expecting to be granted permits to once again sell certain AI chips in China, its most powerful hardware is still under strict US export controls there and elsewhere.\n\u201cTo mitigate the risk of misuse, some pundits and policymakers propose requiring hardware \u2018kill switches\u2019 or built-in controls that can remotely disable GPUs without user knowledge and consent,\u201d wrote Reber Jr. \u201cSome suspect they might already exist,\u201d he continues, in a nod to a probe already launched in China over alleged \u201cloopholes and backdoor\u201d vulnerabilities in the H20 chips that have been sold in the country.\n\u201cThere is no such thing as a \u2018good\u2019 secret backdoor,\u201d Reber Jr. argues, \u201conly dangerous vulnerabilities that need to be eliminated.\u201d He goes on to call kill switches \u201can open invitation for disaster,\u201d before making it explicit that his intended audience is US policymakers: \u201cThat\u2019s not sound policy. It\u2019s an overreaction that would irreparably harm America\u2019s economic and national security interests.\u201d\nBoth Nvidia and the US government would like the company to be the dominant supplier of AI chips to China, but the suggestion of direct US access to the hardware might put that at risk. Chinese chip companies are steadily improving their performance and production capacity, as China looks for a homegrown alternative. That raises the possibility that Nvidia will be usurped in the market by Huawei, a company that knows a thing or two about losing market share over alleged government access.\nMost Popular\n- Reddit will block the Internet Archive\n- GitHub just got less independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\n- RFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American \u2014 that future\u2019s not as healthy as he thinks\n- Ford reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs\n- Hyundai wants Ioniq 5 owners to pay to fix a keyless entry security hole"

      "text": "Stop me if you\u2019ve heard this one before: a new wave of tariffs are taking effect today.\nTrump\u2019s endless new tariffs are threatening businesses \u2014 and you\nConsumers could start to feel the pricing pain soon.\nConsumers could start to feel the pricing pain soon.\nAnnounced on July 31st, the latest set of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on foreign imports \u2014 possibly illegally \u2014 will set a floor of 15 percent for around 40 countries with a trade deficit with the US. There\u2019s an even higher rate for another couple dozen countries, as CNN has reported. This raises the floor for many countries from the universal tariff rate of 10 percent that Trump previously levied, though some goods, like smartphones, are carved out of higher rates. Tariff escalation seems far from over, with Trump threatening on Wednesday to impose a 100 percent tariff on semiconductors \u2014 unless companies build manufacturing plants in the US.\nAs Trump has ratcheted up pressure on foreign imports over the last few months, some Americans might not have noticed a marked difference in what they\u2019re spending, especially as huge tax hikes have been announced and then delayed or cut back. Trump\u2019s perpetually changing tariff deadlines and rates led a Financial Times columnist to coin the phrase \u201cTACO trade,\u201d short for \u201cTrump Always Chickens Out.\u201d But experts say that some product categories have already seen clear price upticks, and more are likely on the way. Meanwhile, businesses have been left bracing for the impact of added taxes on imported goods, dealing with the uncertainty of how and whether they\u2019ll actually take effect.\nExperts warn that this new, broad wave of taxes, compounding existing baseline tariffs, may soon become more noticeable. \u201cThe impact of tariffs comes like waves, and it comes in slow motion,\u201d says Monica Gorman, managing director at Crowell Global Advisors and a former National Economic Council official in the Biden administration. \u201cBecause of the way supply chains are structured, we don\u2019t feel it right away. But that doesn\u2019t mean we aren\u2019t going to feel it. And, in fact, I think we will begin to start to feel it this fall and winter.\u201d\n\u201cThe impact of tariffs comes like waves, and it comes in slow motion\u201d\nSo far, consumer-facing businesses in particular have taken steps to avoid raising prices for their customers as the economy is already facing a pullback in spending. \u201cFor those businesses that know that their consumers have less ability to absorb, they\u2019re going to do everything they can before they raise prices,\u201d Gorman says. That\u2019s meant doing things like stocking extra inventory before Trump\u2019s first round of \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs took effect in April. \u201cThey\u2019ve now sold through that inventory,\u201d Gorman says. \u201cAnd so what\u2019s coming in now is orders that were not yet in the United States when the tariffs went into effect, and that is only going to rise from this point forward.\u201d\nThe impact might look different across sectors or hit at different points. For example, this new wave of tariffs includes a 20 percent tariff on goods from Vietnam and other places in Southeast Asia, where apparel production is common, likely impacting clothing goods. The National Retail Federation (NRF), a trade association, notes that automotive supply retailers have more wiggle room in their margins to absorb added costs than grocery stores. But even when retailers don\u2019t pass on costs to consumers, the NRF argues that it could still hurt the economy more broadly. \u201cThis is because cuts are made elsewhere \u2014 in jobs and investments,\u201d Mark Mathews, the NRF\u2019s chief economist, wrote in a July blog post. \u201cFalling business investment has been the key driver of GDP reductions in previous recessions.\u201d\nUncertainty about what tariff policies might look like in the next year or even week contributes to businesses\u2019 hesitancy to make long-term strategic changes. \u201cIf you\u2019re a business and looking to make a three- to five-year investment, are you certain that this is the tariff environment that you\u2019re going to have in five years? Particularly if you\u2019re looking to build in the United States?\u201d Gorman asks. \u201cGiven that uncertainty, I would anticipate we may still see capital sitting on the sidelines, businesses still playing a game of wait-and-see, until there\u2019s just more sense of what the longer term outlook is.\u201d\nAnother confusing element for businesses to navigate is a new 40 percent tariff on transshipments, or goods shipped indirectly to the US without \u201csubstantial transformation.\u201d The idea is to make sure suppliers aren\u2019t evading high tariffs by routing through countries facing lower ones, and a senior Trump administration official told reporters last week that this definition could be substantially broadened, The New York Times reported. Doing so could mean added costs for businesses that are currently difficult to predict.\nSo far, US businesses and consumers have really only seen the first phase of tariffs\u2019 impact, says a source familiar with corporate lobbying efforts, who spoke on background to give insight into private conversations. \u201cCompanies have been preparing as much as they possibly could, but the sort of on again, off again; numbers up, numbers down; letters, no letters; do we have an executive order? Do we have a fact sheet? Do we have a Truth Social post? have made it hard to plan.\u201d As Thursday\u2019s so-called \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs take effect, this person says, consumers may soon begin to see their effect reflected in prices. \u201cAnyone who tells you, \u2018well, we\u2019ve had tariffs for six months and they\u2019re not hurting the economy,\u2019 they\u2019re really leaving out the fact that those big reciprocal tariffs that the President has imposed haven\u2019t gone into effect yet, and that we\u2019re still going to see those impacts start to really hit people.\u201d\nGorman expects consumers to notice tariff impacts in more purchases this holiday season. Even though many businesses tried to stock up ahead of \u201cLiberation Day\u201d in April, they are also constrained by storage space and cost for extra inventory. Still, some product categories, like baby products, have already seen large impacts. Since many baby products can\u2019t easily move manufacturing from China where Trump has already levied high tariffs, products like strollers and car seats have just recently started to see average retail prices rising anywhere from 10 to 35 percent, Gorman says.\n\u201cThe last several months, these tariffs really have upended the global trading system as we\u2019ve known it,\u201d Gorman says. \u201cPutting these tariffs on is asking everyone across the board to rethink how they do business. And that\u2019s a lot for any economy to absorb.\u201d\nMost Popular\n- Reddit will block the Internet Archive\n- GitHub just got less independent at Microsoft after CEO resignation\n- RFK Jr. wants a wearable on every American \u2014 that future\u2019s not as healthy as he thinks\n- Ford reveals breakthrough process for lower priced EVs\n- Hyundai wants Ioniq 5 owners to pay to fix a keyless entry security hole"
