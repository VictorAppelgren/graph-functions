  "title": "Rabies: A Look at Why Vets Are So Strict about Rules",
  "description": "Rabies is 100% fatal and 100% preventable. An animal health insider explains the real-world reasons behind the rigid protocols\u2014and why there's no room for error.",
  "content": "It\u2019s a conversation that happens in clinics every day. \u201cMy dog got into a fight with a raccoon.\u201d Or, \u201cA stray cat scratched my son.\u201d Or the dreaded, \u201cMy dog bit the neighbor\u2019s kid.\u201d Then come the questions. The frantic, hopeful questions. Was the vaccine booster due last month or this month? Does a scratch count? The dog is friendly, it was an accident, so we don\u2019t really have to quarantine him, right?\n\nThis is the central frustration of rabies. It\u2019s a disease of absolutes managed in a world of gray areas. We in the animal health community know the stakes. Once clinical signs show up, it\u2019s over. A horrific, unstoppable neurological march to a 100% fatal conclusion. There is no treatment. There is no cure. There is only prevention. And that prevention is built on rules. Inflexible, inconvenient, non-negotiable rules. Because the virus doesn\u2019t care about intentions. It doesn\u2019t care if the dog is usually a sweetheart.\n\nTransmission is simple. Saliva or neural tissue meets broken skin or a mucous membrane [2]. The incubation period is a wild card\u2014a few weeks, a few months, sometimes longer. A ticking clock with no visible timer. This is why we can\u2019t afford to be flexible. It\u2019s why public health officials seem so rigid.\n\nWe\u2019ve had incredible success, don\u2019t get it wrong. The mandatory dog vaccination programs in the U.S. worked miracles. We went from nearly 7,000 rabid dogs in 1947 to just a handful in recent years [1]. A true public health triumph. But success breeds complacency. Now, the most common rabid domestic animal isn\u2019t a dog. It\u2019s a cat [1]. Why? The perception that indoor cats are safe. The idea that a cat doesn\u2019t need a rabies shot because it \u201cnever goes outside.\u201d Until it does. A quick dash out an open door. A bat that gets into the house. That\u2019s all it takes.\n\nSo we push. We explain that the vaccine isn\u2019t just for the animal; it\u2019s a firewall for the family. It turns a potential public health crisis into a manageable event. It\u2019s the difference between a 10-day observation period and a terrible choice.\n\nThe Wildlife Problem We Can\u2019t Vaccinate Away\n\nThe truth is, we\u2019ve mostly won the battle with domestic animal rabies. The real, persistent threat comes from the reservoir we can\u2019t completely control. Wildlife. Raccoons, skunks, foxes, and the one that causes the most confusion: bats [3]. We can deploy oral rabies vaccines in bait for raccoons in specific areas, and it helps. But we can\u2019t vaccinate them all. We can\u2019t build a perfect wall between the wild and our backyards.\n\nThis is where the public\u2019s understanding often hits a snag. The risk isn\u2019t theoretical. It\u2019s a raccoon stumbling through the yard in broad daylight. A friendly fox that seems tame. And then there are the bats. They are a special category of risk. Their teeth are so fine, their bites can be so small, they can go completely unnoticed.\n\nThis leads to one of the most important and misunderstood rules in all of rabies prevention. If you wake up and there is a bat in your room, you need post-exposure prophylaxis. Full stop. The same goes for finding a bat in a room with an unattended child or an incapacitated adult. We don\u2019t ask if you think you were bitten. The risk of a microscopic, unfelt bite is too high. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and every other public health body is united on this. You assume exposure and you act. Immediately.\n\nThen there are the hybrids. The wolf-dogs, the Savannah cats. People love the exotic look, but they create a public health blind spot. There are no rabies vaccines licensed for use in wild animals or hybrids. So if one of them bites someone, we have no validated vaccine protocol to fall back on. From a public health standpoint, they are treated as wildlife. It\u2019s a harsh reality that owners often don\u2019t want to hear. But the rules of biology and virology don\u2019t bend for our pet preferences.\n\nHolding the Line: What Rabies Prevention Really Means\n\nSo what happens when the firewall is breached? When someone is bitten by a stray, or scratched by a potentially rabid animal? We turn to our last line of defense. Post-Exposure Prophylaxis, or PEP. It sounds complicated, but it\u2019s a straightforward emergency plan. First, you wash the wound aggressively with soap and water for at least 15 minutes. A simple step that can dramatically reduce the viral load.\n\nThen comes the medical part. PEP is a two-pronged attack. The first is passive immunization: Human Rabies Immune Globulin (HRIG). This is basically a dose of borrowed antibodies. It\u2019s injected directly into and around the wound site to neutralize the virus on the spot before it can get a foothold in the nervous system. It\u2019s a critical first strike. The second part is active immunization: a series of rabies vaccine doses, typically given on days 0, 3, 7, and 14. This teaches the person\u2019s own immune system to build its own long-lasting defense against the virus. It has to be started quickly. Waiting for symptoms is a death sentence.\n\nDeciding who needs PEP is a careful risk assessment. Was the bite from a healthy pet dog that can be quarantined and observed for 10 days? PEP can likely wait. Was it an unprovoked attack from a stray dog or a wild carnivore? Assume the worst and start PEP. Was it a bat? Start PEP. There is no room for \u201cwait and see.\u201d\n\nEvery time we counsel a client on a routine feline vaccine, every time we fill out bite report paperwork, every time we have that difficult conversation about quarantines, we are holding a line. It\u2019s a line between public safety and one of the oldest, most feared diseases known to humanity. The work is repetitive. It can feel thankless. But it\u2019s why rabies remains a rare tragedy instead of a common horror.\n\n[1] Singh, R., Singh, K. P., Cherian, S., Saminathan, M., Kapoor, S., Manjunatha Reddy, G. B., Panda, S., & Dhama, K.

      "text": "Pet Projects: Q&A with CatCon Founder Susan Michals\n- Share via\nEvery summer, thousands of cat lovers, artists, and feline celebrities descend on Pasadena for CatCon, a one-of-a-kind convention that\u2019s part art show, part adoption fair, and part community celebration of all things cat. Founded by journalist and producer Susan Michals, CatCon has grown in ten years from niche event into the country\u2019s biggest gathering for fans of felines.\nWe talked with Susan to talk about the evolution of CatCon, the changing image of the \u201ccat person,\u201d and why supporting small businesses and animal welfare is at the heart of it all. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nQ: Can you share a bit about your background and how you went from being a journalist to launching CatCon and other cat-focused projects?\nSure, I worked for years at E on shows like Keeping Up With The Kardashians and Live from the Red Carpet. I was lead producer for promos for 160 countries outside of the US. At the same time, I like to say you know this is LA, everybody has kind of a side hustle these days, two or three jobs. I really wanted to be a journalist, and I worked for Wall Street Journal, Vanity Fair, Huffington Post. But it wasn\u2019t my ticket out of my day job, because, as a freelance journalist it doesn\u2019t really pay that well.\nNEWSLETTER\nLooking to adopt or raise a pet? Get expert tips and tricks right in your mailbox.\nSo I moved from celebrity into the art world because I have an art background. And the first show I created was Cat Art Show. That debuted in 2014 with established artists\u2014my headliners were Shepard Fairey, Mark Wright and Gary Baseman, all LA-based artists. And then I had emerging artists as well. 4000 people showed up at that show, and I realized that this was a demographic of cat lovers that was not being represented.\nQ: What made you realize there was a need for something like CatCon, and how did it get started?\nAt that point, the only thing on the feline landscape was really the breeder shows, sort of the best of breed, the Westminster Dog Show kind of thing. But regular cat fans were not being represented. Many of these fans were a younger demographic. And so I thought, you know what? I want to do a bigger show, like a convention that would appeal to them, and I needed to curate it like an art show.\nI decided I wanted to do information, education and entertainment. Because what I found is that people really wanted to learn a lot about their animals, and you can make even a topic like \u201cclipping your cat\u2019s nails\u201d sexy if you have the right speaker, the right title, and a dynamic person on stage to talk about what this means.\nQ: How did the first CatCon come together, and what did you learn from that initial experience?\nThe first year, there was only three of us working on this. I curated all the exhibitors. I had people apply. I put together a workshop schedule, a celebri-cat schedule. I wanted it to be immersive as well, and so I thought up activations and I pitched sponsors and sort of brought it all together.\nI will say is that my experience working in production and as a journalist really lent itself to putting on a convention, because it is a production in its own right. I brought on people that had done trade shows and worked Comic Con and the Toy Fair to really help me build this show from the ground up, and they are still with me to this day.\nQ: Supporting artists and small businesses seems like a major part of CatCon. Why is that important to you, and how does the event help local communities?\nIt\u2019s very important for me to offer opportunity to small businesses. Very, very important. It goes back to the Cat Art Show of emerging and established artists. Big sponsors help to support us and finance the show, but it\u2019s very important to me in this curatorial process of picking exhibitors to support those that are on Etsy. Those that are small businesses and give them the opportunity to showcase their wares and their talents.\nAnd it was also very important for us to give back to the city of Pasadena and Altadena. We have been, as a community, ravaged by the recent fires, and Pasadena Humane is still boarding animals that their owners have not found a place to live. They\u2019re continuing to board and support the people of this community by taking care of their animals. Pasadena Humane and the city of Pasadena have been so good to us. Los Angeles in general for the past 10 years, but specifically Pasadena since 2017.\nQ: Cat ownership has a lot of stereotypes. How have you seen CatCon help shift those perceptions?\nThere\u2019s this\u2014and it\u2019s still very present\u2014this negative association with cat ownership, the crazy cat lady. Cat ladies are 60 plus, hoarders, spinsters, Grey Gardens, Dickensian characters. They live with 1000 cats, smell like cat pee, and are unmarried, right?\nI will tell you that through the years I get asked two questions every time I say I run a cat convention. The first question is, \u201cHow many cats do you have?\u201d And I say one, and people are shocked. I have one cat and one dog.\nAnd a second question that I get asked, which I think is really actually rude, but it\u2019s what I get asked, is, \u201cAre you married?\u201d Every time I say I am between husbands at the moment, but that\u2019s not what defines me.\nAnd what I found is that, over the years, with CatCon, I think we\u2019ve made a significant dent in what it means to be a cat person. It\u2019s when you put the word crazy in front of cat lady that has the negative connotation.\nWhen you say Catwoman versus cat lady, what do you think of? Catwoman\u2014strong and fierce and independent, right? Sexy, right? When you look at the word cat lady, it\u2019s the exact opposite\u2014somebody that you don\u2019t want to be with, somebody that isn\u2019t empowered. What we\u2019ve seen over the years with CatCon is the rise of a different cat lady. It is a combination of empowerment, passion, enthusiasm, and independence.\nQ: CatCon is clearly more than just a trade show. What are some ways you keep the experience immersive and up-to-date with cat culture trends?\nOur convention is not just cat food and cat litter. We had Petfinder there talking about adoptions. We have people that are bringing the latest in cat tech in water fountains and smart litter boxes and AI and all these different things. We have people that are creating clothing for humans that is cat-centric. We had a fashion show on Saturday called Project Catwalk, where people were given the idea of elevating the cat lady.\nQ: The event draws an impressive range of attendees. Can you share more about the community and celebrities involved?\nWhat I love about CatCon is: there\u2019s no dog park for the cat person, right? There\u2019s no place to commune, and it\u2019s a community of people that come together to share one single purpose: that they love kitties. Animals give us such wonderful unconditional love and it\u2019s my job to create something year after year that people want to come back for.\nThere are so many celebrities that are cat lovers and we\u2019re right here in Los Angeles so we get a lot of visits from the stars. We had Jake Johnson there. Matt Groening from The Simpsons was there. Lisa Loeb was there. Alexandra Shipp, Seth Green. David Dastmalchian was there from MurderBot and Dexter. He came with his family, and Gilles Marini comes all the time. It\u2019s amazing to see them show up and support the event, to help raise our profile and get the word out.\nQ: In recent years, we\u2019ve seen the \u201cadventure cat\u201d phenomenon take off. Has this also changed the perception of cats and cat owners?\nWith the advent of the adventure cat, of which we had a number at CatCon, it\u2019s no longer that cats are just indoor creatures. Now, I would say the majority of them are still very much indoor creatures, but we are seeing this definitive shift.You will see hotels that say pet friendly and you have to see if they take cats specifically but a lot more have started to. Hyatt, Sheraton, case by case, they\u2019re starting to accept cats, because we are seeing this uptick in people taking their cats with them when they travel.\nThe adventure cats that come to CatCon are like Hollywood child stars. They\u2019ve been doing this since they were little, so they\u2019re used to this sort of thing, the crowds and the attention. We have all these kitties this year who did meet and greets, and they average 100 meet and greets per hour.\nWe had two cats, Sponge Cake and Buttercream. They travel with their owners all over the world in a backpack. They just got back from Venice and they\u2019ve got 2 million followers.\nQ: What keeps you motivated year after year to keep growing and evolving CatCon?\nWhat I know about Hollywood and sort of the way we live now is you can do a phenomenal job, but every year you\u2019ve got to up the ante. And I welcome that challenge, because I want to keep it fresh. And that\u2019s why I work on CatCon all year round, because I\u2019m looking for what\u2019s going to make this audience come back. What\u2019s going to make them happy, and what\u2019s going to help them make a better life for them and their pets.\nQ: Tell us about your latest project, The Meow Factor. What is it, and where do you see it going?\nI spoke at South by Southwest in 2019, and I really loved it. And I would really love to do a TED Talk eventually. I love public speaking. And I thought, you know, there\u2019s really nothing out there for cat people in\u2014I mean, sure you can watch TikTok videos, you can watch a YouTube video, but how do I continue to bring the community together in person? So what I decided to do was to create this sort of salon environment called The Meow Factor.\nWe did something about my\u2014basically, my cat\u2019s a celebrity, and how I\u2019m dealing with that. We did something on cat portraiture. And then we did something with Nathan the Cat Lady and Sterling the Trap King about trap neuter return. I\u2019m creating more of a salon setting. It\u2019s not 300 people, it\u2019s 50 people so there\u2019s better engagement and opportunity to ask more questions.\nI\u2019ve already done it at Annenberg Pet Space, and it\u2019s something that I\u2019m looking at branching out across the country. Once I get a little bit of rest after CatCon, I\u2019m definitely going to continue on my kitty trajectory.\nQ: And finally, when can we expect the next Cat Art Show?\nIt\u2019s going to be sometime next year. January 2024 was 10 years, and I do it every two, so at some point next year. I don\u2019t know where it\u2019ll be or precisely when, but stay tuned!"

      "text": "Why Microchipping Might Be the Most Important Thing You Do for Your Pet\n- Share via\n- A microchip is a permanent form of pet ID that can\u2019t fall off or wear out\u2014and helps reunite lost pets with their families.\n- Registration is key: without updated contact info in the registry, the chip can\u2019t help bring your pet home.\n- The procedure is quick, safe, and affordable\u2014and complements (not replaces) collars and ID tags.\nIf your dog slips out the front door on the 4th of July or your cat goes missing during a move, there\u2019s one tiny thing that could bring them home: a microchip. It\u2019s about the size of a grain of rice, but it can make a world of difference. Implanted just beneath the skin, a microchip gives your pet a permanent form of ID\u2014one that won\u2019t fall off, get lost, or wear out.\nMicrochipping isn\u2019t new, but it\u2019s still one of the most effective yet underutilized tools we have for reuniting lost pets with their families. The American Animal Hospital Association recommends it, and most shelters and vets rely on it every day.\nNEWSLETTER\nLooking to adopt or raise a pet? Get expert tips and tricks right in your mailbox.\nA microchip is a tiny glass capsule with a radio frequency ID inside\u2014no battery, no GPS, nothing fancy. It gets injected under your pet\u2019s skin (usually between the shoulder blades) during a quick vet visit. The chip itself doesn\u2019t store your name or phone number; it just holds a unique ID number.\nIf your pet is found and taken to a shelter or vet, they\u2019ll scan them with a handheld reader. That brings up the microchip number, which is then used to pull your contact info from a registry database. No personal info lives in the chip itself\u2014just that one number.\nWhy Microchipping Your Dog or Cat Is Worth It\nHere\u2019s the thing about collars and tags: they\u2019re great, but they come off. A microchip doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s there for life, and if it\u2019s registered properly, it gives shelters and vets a fast way to get your pet back to you.\nA few more reasons to consider it:\n- It works. Microchipped dogs are more than twice as likely to be reunited with their owners.\n- It\u2019s low-maintenance. No batteries, no upgrades, no fuss.\n- It\u2019s cost-effective. Most vets and shelters offer the service at a reasonable price.\n- It plays well with others. Universal scanners can read most chips, even if they\u2019re from different manufacturers.\nHow the Microchipping Procedure Works, Step by Step\nGetting your pet chipped is about as simple as getting a vaccine. It\u2019s done with a needle\u2014just a quick pinch, and it\u2019s over. After the chip is implanted, your vet will scan it to make sure it\u2019s working. Then comes the part that gets skipped more often than it should: registration.\nYou\u2019ll need to register the chip number with your contact info through the manufacturer\u2019s registry. Most let you do it online in just a few minutes. And if your phone number or address ever changes? Update the registry. It\u2019s the only way the chip can actually help if your pet goes missing.\nHow to Register Your Pet\u2019s Microchip\u2014and Why It Matters\nRegistering your pet\u2019s microchip is what connects their ID number to your contact information. Without registration, a chip is essentially useless. Most manufacturers make the process simple, allowing you to register online. Don\u2019t forget to update your info anytime you move or change phone numbers.\nTrusted Microchip Registries for Pets\nThere are a few different chip makers and registries out there. Some offer extra features like travel support, lost pet alerts, or even GPS add-ons (though GPS isn\u2019t part of the chip itself). Others stick to the basics.\nHere are a few trusted registries:\nNot sure which registry your pet\u2019s chip is connected to? The AAHA microchip lookup tool can help.\nAre There Any Risks to Microchipping Your Pet?\nIt\u2019s rare, but like any procedure, microchipping does come with minor risks. Some pets might have a little swelling or tenderness at the injection site. In very rare cases, a chip can migrate or cause a lump. Serious complications like infection or tumor formation are extremely uncommon.\nMost pets don\u2019t even notice it\u2019s there.\nWhy Microchipping Is Just One Part of a Complete Pet Safety Plan\nA microchip is one piece of a larger safety net. Your pet should still wear a collar with ID tags. You should still keep them indoors or supervised outside. And if you travel with them, especially internationally, you\u2019ll need to make sure their chip is ISO-compliant and registered with the appropriate authority.\nBut having that chip in place gives you a backup if something goes wrong\u2014and that backup can bring your pet home.\nThe Bottom Line\nFor something so small, a microchip can have a huge impact. It\u2019s fast, affordable, and could be the reason your pet finds their way back to you. Just don\u2019t forget the most important part: keeping your registration info up to date.\nFAQs\nWhat is a microchip and how does it help reunite lost pets with their owners?\nA microchip is a small implant that stores a unique ID number. If your pet is lost, shelters and vets scan the chip to retrieve your contact info from a registry.\nDoes a microchip replace a collar and ID tags?\nNo. A microchip is a permanent backup, but pets should still wear collars and ID tags for visible identification.\nHow do I register my pet\u2019s microchip?\nRegister your pet\u2019s chip through the manufacturer\u2019s online registry. Keep your contact information current to ensure the chip can help.\nAre there any risks to microchipping my pet?\nMinor risks include swelling or tenderness. Serious complications are very rare. Most pets don\u2019t notice the chip after implantation.\nHow much does microchipping cost and is it worth it?\nIt\u2019s typically affordable and requires no ongoing maintenance. Microchipped pets are more than twice as likely to be returned home."

      "text": "How to Ensure the Perfect Match With Your New Dog: Expert Tips from Trainer Michael Hill\n- Share via\nMany people consider the act of bringing a dog into their home to be a fun and exciting milestone in their lives. While it can very much be both of those things, it is also a long-term commitment that can shape your family\u2019s life for years to come.\nChoosing the right dog means understanding how a dog\u2019s background, their energy level, and their needs align with your household\u2019s lifestyle and abilities. When you get that wrong it can lead to stress and disappointment. The right match, though? That\u2019s what fosters a bond that lasts a lifetime.\nNEWSLETTER\nLooking to adopt or raise a pet? Get expert tips and tricks right in your mailbox.\nFirst Things First: Assess Your Family\u2019s Lifestyle\nThe first step to finding the right dog is taking an honest look at your day-to-day life. The needs of a dog go beyond just love. They need structure. They need attention. They need consistency. Daily care, training, exercise and socialization are all critical, especially in the early months.\nSo you have to ask yourself:\nDo we have the time and patience for a puppy\u2019s demands? Or would an adult or senior dog be a better fit?\nAre we equipped to navigate behavioral challenges like separation anxiety or leash reactivity?\nAre we prepared for potential health and grooming needs, with the right support systems in place?\nEnergy Levels of You and Your Pet Matter\nYou have to match a dog\u2019s activity needs to your own. High-drive working breeds like Doberman Pinschers need a lot of stimulation and space, while many companion dog breeds are content with a leisurely walk and a nap.\nBe Mindful of Your Living Situation\nDo you live in an apartment or a home with a yard? If you have an active dog breed and no yard, you have to make sure you can still provide the necessary exercise and engaging activity for that dog.\nAre there children in the household? If so, you have to prioritize breeds who tend to enjoy kids and consider adult dogs who have a proven track record of being reliable with children. Nervous and fragile dogs, for example, may have a difficult time being comfortable around kids.\nAre there other pets already in the household? Size, energy, and behavior differences can all play into harmony and safety in a multi-pet home.\nUse Knowledgeable Experts to Help With Your Dog Search\nWhether you\u2019re enlisting the help of a rescue organization or a responsible breeder, informed guidance is essential. Be honest about your experience level and consider professional resources that can help you make a well-informed decision.\nProfessional dog trainers and veterinarians offer years of experience interacting with many different dog breeds in their respective fields. Even dog-savvy friends and family can offer unbiased evaluation and advice relative to your personality and lifestyle that can be valuable in your matchmaking journey.\nUnderstand Temperament\nIf possible, consider visiting a potential litter and observing the interactions in person. A reputable breeder or experienced foster can give insights into each pup\u2019s personality tendencies, rather than just relying on what you see during a short visit.\nWhen you\u2019re evaluating adoptable dogs, ask the shelter staff about the dog\u2019s behavior, their triggers, and their history. The stress of rehoming can dramatically impact a dog\u2019s behavior, so they will need time and support during the acclimation process in their new home.\nThink about what stage of life you\u2019re in so that you can be fair to the dog. Young professionals, older adults, or families with kids all have different needs when it comes to temperament and energy levels.\nHealth Considerations\nAlways request vet records for your new dog, and make sure to also bring them to visit your personal veterinarian right after adoption. If purchasing from a breeder, ask about breed-specific health tests recommended by the OFA (Orthopedic Foundation for Animals) and spend time educating yourself on the family health history. Knowing what to expect can save you heartbreak and money down the line.\nBreed Characteristics vs. Individual Traits\nGeneral Tendencies Among Specific Breeds\nBreeds and families of dogs have genetic predispositions. Some are eager to work, while others are bred for calm companionship. But you have to remember that every dog is an individual. Each puppy should be assessed for their specific personality profile. We\u2019re talking about the core temperament and behavioral traits that define a dog\u2019s unique disposition, communication style, and interaction with its environment.\nThe Importance of a Behavioral Assessment\nDon\u2019t choose based on looks alone. Talk to the breeders or the rescue staff about the dog\u2019s behavior. Ask them: Is the dog eager to engage or more reserved? How does the dog respond to new environments or people? Are there any notable stressors that the dog does not enjoy?\nAvoid These Common Matching Mistakes\nLooks Aren\u2019t Everything When Selecting a Breed\nI know, a fluffy puppy or Instagram-trendy breed can be irresistible. But you have to focus on personality and lifestyle fit for the long term. When expectations are misaligned, that\u2019s what often leads to rehoming.\nShould You Adopt a Rescue or Purchase a Dog Through a Breeder?\nThere\u2019s no one right way to bring a dog into your life. Adopting saves lives and can be deeply rewarding, but reputable breeders provide helpful data for transparency and predictability and will stand by their dogs for life. The key is to avoid unvetted sources that prioritize profit over welfare.\nI always tell families who find using a reputable breeder to be the right pathway for finding their dog that they can still support rescue work by volunteering time, donating needed supplies and pledging financial support.\nRed Flags to Watch For\nLook out for breeders or adopters who don\u2019t provide health records or dodge questions. It\u2019s also a red flag if someone is pressuring you into a quick decision, or if you\u2019re choosing a dog purely on the \u201ccute\u201d factor without considering your lifestyle. If it feels too good to be true, you have to trust your intuition. Look for honesty and integrity in your matchmaking inquiries.\nPlan Accordingly for the Future\nTraining Is an Investment For Life\nTraining isn\u2019t just for the early days. It\u2019s a lifelong process that builds confidence and communication. It can prevent future issues and deepen your bond.\nRemember That Family Dynamics Change\nYou have to think ahead: How might your family grow or change? Will a dog that thrives with young children still fit when the kids are teens? Will your routine shift with a career change or a move?\nBringing Your Dog Home\nPreparation\nBefore bringing your new dog home there are some key things that should be taken care of. Puppy-proof your space, gather supplies and book a first vet appointment right away. Creating a safe and calm environment sets the tone for success.\nEarly Integration\nStart simple routines and training right away. Give your new dog time to adjust, and use those early weeks to build trust and introduce new experiences with plenty of quality bonding time.\nA Lifelong Bond Worth Building\nGoing through a thoughtful and deliberative dog matchmaking process is the foundation to successful dog ownership. Putting in the effort when it comes to research, preparation, and training will help make your new dog an integral part of your family, bringing joy, comfort and connection for years to come."

      "text": "Service Dog Rights: What the Law Actually Says (and What It Doesn\u2019t)\n- Share via\nService animals are amazing, right? They\u2019re MVPs that they help people with disabilities live life with confidence and independence. We\u2019re not talking about a handful of dogs, either. It\u2019s estimated by Share America that there are around 500,000 service dogs working in the U.S. Thanks to federal laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) these incredible dogs and their handlers are protected. It means they have the right to be in all sorts of public places, from stores and restaurants to public buildings and schools.\nWhether you\u2019re a business owner, a landlord or the owner of a service animal yourself, understanding these laws is crucial. It\u2019s the only way to avoid confusion, prevent awkward situations and make sure everyone gets treated fairly.\nNEWSLETTER\nLooking to adopt or raise a pet? Get expert tips and tricks right in your mailbox.\nWhat Exactly Counts as a Service Animal?\nSo what\u2019s the difference between a service dog and a pet? The ADA is pretty specific about this. A service animal is a dog that is individually trained to perform specific, disability-related tasks. We\u2019re talking about things like guiding someone who is blind, retrieving dropped items or even interrupting an anxiety attack. The dog\u2019s job has to be directly linked to the person\u2019s disability, whether that\u2019s a physical or mental impairment.\nDog breeds aren\u2019t restricted. You could have a tiny terrier or a great dane. The key is the training. Not the breed. Even a miniature horse might also qualify under certain conditions. But just providing comfort or companionship isn\u2019t enough. Emotional support animals or therapy animals don\u2019t count as service animals under the ADA unless they\u2019ve been specifically trained to perform those key tasks. It\u2019s all about the job, not just the emotional support.\nWhere Can Service Dogs Go?\nA service dog can go pretty much anywhere the public is allowed. That includes restaurants, schools, and hotels. Businesses can\u2019t deny access because of a \u201cno pets\u201d policy or because they have a breed restriction. In fact, there are only two questions they are legally allowed to ask you: Is the dog a service animal required because of a disability? What tasks is the dog trained to perform?\nThat\u2019s it. They can\u2019t ask for any paperwork, certification or proof. They also can\u2019t treat the handler differently unless the service dog is misbehaving (like being aggressive or not housebroken).\nYour Service Dog and Your Rights in Housing and Work\nIn a professional setting, the ADA says employers must make a reasonable accommodation for a service animal. If it\u2019s a psychiatric service animal or an emotional support animal, an employer can ask for medical documentation that confirms the need for the animal. But they can\u2019t ask for any kind of official certification or registration for the animal itself.\nIn housing, the Fair Housing Act has your back. Landlords have to accept assistance animals\u2014including emotional support animals\u2014even if their policy says \u201cno pets.\u201d They can\u2019t charge you extra fees or deposits for the service dog and the animal is allowed in all areas used by tenants.\nNavigating Schools and Transportation\nWhen it comes to education, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the ADA ensure that service dogs can go to school with their person. Public schools and universities have to make reasonable modifications to accommodate them.\nFor transportation, federal law is clear: service animals are allowed on public transit, in airports and on ride-share services.\nFlying with a Service Dog\nUnder the Air Carrier Access Act, flying with a service animal is allowed without pet fees or advanced notice. Psychiatric service animals that are trained to perform tasks related to a mental disability also qualify. You can take your service animal\u2019s safe equipment with you and they are allowed in all areas of the airport, from check-in to security.\nCosts and Resources\nYes owning a service dog comes with costs. Just like owning a non-service dog there is food, training, and healthcare to worry about. But the financial commitment can be steep. A professionally trained service dog can cost a person between $10,000 and $20,000 on average, according to the US Service Animals. Because of the high demand and rigorous training there can even be a wait time of one to five years for a trained dog. That said, there are organizations that offer grants or tax deductions to help. Local disability groups are also a fantastic resource for everything from legal help to finding housing.\nYou can file a complaint with the Department of Justice if you\u2019re ever denied access or treated unfairly. Also, you can reach out to local disability advocacy groups for legal assistance.\nFrequently Asked Questions About Service Dog Laws\nDoes a Service Dog Need to be Certified?\nThis is a big one: the ADA does not require certification. Handlers can even train their own dogs. So all those online sites selling \u201cofficial\u201d certificates or ID cards? They\u2019re not legally recognized by federal law. It\u2019s all about the dog\u2019s training and behavior, and its ability to perform tasks related to its handler\u2019s needs.\nDo I need paperwork for my service dog?\nNo. The ADA doesn\u2019t require it. All those \u2018official\u2019 credentials you see online are not legally valid.\nCan emotional support animals be service animals?\nOnly if they are trained to perform specific tasks. Providing comfort alone is not enough to be considered a service animal under the ADA.\nWhat breeds can be service dogs?\nAny breed can be a service animal as long as it has the required training.\nWhat questions can a business legally ask?\nThey can only ask if the dog is a service animal and what tasks it performs. They can\u2019t ask for documentation or ID.\nAre there protections for service animals in training?\nNot under the ADA but some state or local laws might provide access rights during training.\nDo landlords have to allow emotional support animals?\nYes. Under the Fair Housing Act, they have to make reasonable accommodations for assistance animals. This is true even if they aren\u2019t trained to perform tasks."

      "text": "Pet Insurance: Is It Worth It for Healthy Pets?\n- Share via\nOne moment your dog is having the time of their life at the beach. The next, you\u2019re at the vet discussing a cruciate ligament injury, emergency surgery and a bill that could cost thousands. Or your cat, who is usually bright-eyed and demanding breakfast, is suddenly lethargic with tests pointing to a serious illness. These moments are stressful enough without the added weight of a huge vet bill.\nPet ownership is pure joy, but it\u2019s also full of financial surprises, from broken bones to serious illnesses. In fact, more than half of all pet owners in the U.S. say they\u2019ve delayed or skipped care because of the cost.\nNEWSLETTER\nLooking to adopt or raise a pet? Get expert tips and tricks right in your mailbox.\nPet insurance is designed to change that. You pay a monthly premium, and when something happens, whether it\u2019s an accident, a chronic condition or a sudden diagnosis, the insurance company pays a chunk of the cost so you can focus on your pet\u2019s treatment, not your bank account. But is pet insurance really a smart move? Or another way for the industry to make money off of pet owners? The answer, as usual, is complicated.\nThe All-Important Question Of Cost\nHow much you pay for pet insurance depends on your pet. Factors like their age, breed and health all influence the cost. Dogs and cats with higher medical risks, like purebreds or those prone to specific health issues, often cost more to insure than a mixed-breed dog. According to the North American Pet Health Insurance Association, the average accident and illness policy runs about $500 a year for dogs and $300 a year for cats. For a cheaper, accident-only policy, you\u2019ll pay around $150 a year for a dog and $100 for a cat.\nBut remember, this type of policy leaves you completely uncovered for health issues like dental disease, skin allergies or a serious illness. Your monthly premium is also influenced by the insurance company you choose, your deductible, your chosen annual limit and whether you add a separate wellness plan for routine preventive care. Many pet insurers also offer optional coverage for prescription medications.\nWhat Pet Insurance Covers\nMost policies fall into three main buckets: Accident-only policy This covers injuries like broken bones, cuts and swallowed objects. Accident and illness policy This adds coverage for illnesses, chronic conditions and hereditary problems. Wellness plan add-ons These help with preventive care, such as checkups, dental cleanings and flea prevention. Most pet insurance plans cover the big stuff, like emergency surgery, chronic conditions and expensive treatments such as for cancer. But most policies won\u2019t cover pre-existing conditions, cosmetic procedures or have certain waiting periods before coverage begins.\nChoosing the Best Plan for Your Pet\nThe right pet insurance depends on personal finances and your pet\u2019s needs. Consider your monthly premium and annual cost, the reimbursement rate and annual limit, and whether the plan includes preventive care or requires a separate wellness plan. It\u2019s also wise to check if a plan covers common health problems your pet\u2019s breed is prone to. Can you afford the deductible if a big, unexpected expense comes up? Comparing quotes from several pet insurance companies is key to finding the right fit.\nAdditional Special Considerations\nFor active dogs at higher risk of injury or breeds prone to health issues, an accident and illness plan can be a crucial financial safety net. Pet parents with older pets may pay more for pet insurance, but it can still help afford treatment for costly medical bills. Indoor cats might have fewer accidents but can still face serious illnesses or chronic health problems later in life. For some pet owners, the right pet insurance policy makes it easier to budget for vet expenses over the course of their pet\u2019s life.\nAlternatives to Pet Insurance\nSome people choose to self-insure by building a dedicated emergency fund for vet costs. Other alternatives include using vet payment plans or financing like CareCredit or seeking charitable help from animal welfare groups. While these approaches work for some, they lack the built-in financial safety net that pet insurance provides when you\u2019re hit with a huge and sudden vet bill.\nWhat\u2019s Behind Rising Vet Costs\nThanks to advances in veterinary care, your pet can get the same level of attention as in human health insurance. MRIs, orthopedic surgery or advanced cancer treatment. It can all be covered. Those capabilities do mean higher costs. It\u2019s not unusual for a single visit involving diagnostics and treatment to cost thousands.\nSo, Is Pet Insurance Worth It?\nFor some, the answer is a clear yes. Pet insurance is worth it if a sudden vet bill of a few thousand dollars would be a hardship. For others, especially those who can self-insure through savings, it might not be necessary. The key is understanding pet insurance costs, reading the fine print of any plan and choosing coverage that fits your pet\u2019s health risks and your financial comfort zone.\nIf you decide to buy pet insurance, do it early. The younger your pet, the fewer pre-existing conditions you\u2019ll have to worry about and the more likely you\u2019ll have coverage in place when unexpected expenses arrive."

      "text": "The Outdoor vs. Indoor Cat Debate: How to Decide What\u2019s Best for Your Cat\n- Share via\nDeciding whether to let your cat outside is a tough and personal choice faced by every new cat owner. You might like to picture your feline friend frolicking freely in the great outdoors, true to his curious explorer instincts. You might feel guilty as he stares out the window or tries in vain to slip out the front door with you. But the reality is that a cat\u2019s life outside comes with its own complicated set of risks and rewards.\nWhen considering which option to choose, the difference in lifespans is pretty stark. Researchers at the University of California-Davis estimate that while an indoor cat might live a long, happy life of 10 to 15 years, the life expectancy for outdoor cats can be cut dramatically short, often to just 2 to 5 years. That\u2019s a massive difference, and it\u2019s largely due to a cat\u2019s exposure to danger when they\u2019re roaming free.\nNEWSLETTER\nLooking to adopt or raise a pet? Get expert tips and tricks right in your mailbox.\nThe Case for Staying In\nThere\u2019s a reason organizations like the Animal Humane Society advocate for keeping cats indoors. A house cat is shielded from the nasty diseases that other cats might carry, like feline AIDS or feline distemper. They\u2019re also less likely to have a run-in with a wild animal, like a raccoon or a snake. And, of course, they\u2019re safe from the terrifying reality of car traffic. One study from the UK found that nearly half of all cats that die before the age of nine do so because of a road accident.\nYou can still give your indoor cat a wild, exciting life. Cat trees, puzzle toys and a cozy window seat overlooking a bird feeder can provide endless entertainment. With a good setup, your cat can thrive both physically and emotionally indoors.\nThe Risks to Consider from Wild World Outside\nLetting your cat outdoors might seem natural, but it comes with a higher risk of injury, illness and even death. Outdoor cats face threats from cars, aggressive dogs, other cats and wild animals. They\u2019re also much more likely to contract diseases through fighting or just interacting with infected animals.\nAnd while the natural world can be dangerous for your cat, your cat can also be dangerous to the natural world. According to estimates from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, cats kill somewhere between 1.3 to 4 billion birds and 6.3 to 22.3 billion small mammals every single year in the U.S. alone.\nAnd then there\u2019s the heartbreak of a missing cat. Lost cats can be mistaken for strays, picked up by animal control or, or never to be found again.\nFinding a Happy Medium\nIf you do decide to let your cat explore outside, you can take precautions. A microchip and a collar with an ID tag are non-negotiable. Spayed or neutered cats are also less likely to roam far or get into fights.\nConsider installing a cat door that leads to a secure outdoor enclosure\u2014a catio\u2014to give your kitty access to fresh air without the risks. Supervised time outdoors is another option, especially if you live in a rural area. Some cat parents even train their cats to walk on a leash, letting them enjoy the outdoors without the dangers. And of course, keep those vaccinations up to date. Your vet can advise on the right extra protection for indoor-outdoor cats.\nA Word on Community Cats\nNot all cats have homes. Feral and stray cats live outdoors full-time and are at the highest risk for illness and injury. They also reproduce unchecked, leading to overpopulation. Trap-neuter-return (TNR) programs are a humane way to manage community cat colonies by stabilizing their populations and improving their health.\nMaking an Informed Decision\nThere\u2019s no universal answer to whether you should let your cat outside. A young kitten in a busy city faces different challenges than an older cat in a quiet rural area. Talk to your vet about the risks and benefits. They can help you determine whether your cat is better off as a full-time indoor cat or an outdoor cat with some supervision.\nLetting your cat outside might seem like a natural part of owning a cat. But it\u2019s a decision that requires thoughtful consideration. With the right balance of safety, enrichment and care your cat can live a full and contented life."

      "text": "Navigating Viral Encephalitis and Connections to HSV, West Nile, and Rabies\n- Share via\nKey Facts\n- Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1) is the most common cause of sporadic viral encephalitis in the U.S., and immediate treatment with IV acyclovir is critical.\n- Without treatment, HSV encephalitis has a mortality rate of around 59%; with acyclovir, it drops to approximately 25%.\n- There is no specific antiviral therapy for West Nile virus encephalitis; management relies entirely on supportive care like hydration, respiratory support, and seizure control.\n- Rabies encephalitis is nearly 100% fatal once symptoms begin, making prevention through post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) the only effective strategy.\n- In suspected cases of encephalitis with an unknown cause, it is standard practice to begin empiric treatment with IV acyclovir due to the high mortality of untreated HSV.\nWhen the brain gets inflamed, every second counts. Encephalitis symptoms start with flu-like symptoms and can rapidly progress to severe neurological issues. Swelling of the brain tissue can cause serious neurological symptoms and in some cases devastating outcomes.\nEncephalitis is a serious condition that can be life threatening if not treated promptly. Medical care and hospital admission are often required for management and monitoring. While many viruses can cause encephalitis, a few stand out for their prevalence and clinical significance: Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), West Nile Virus (WNV) which is spread by mosquitoes, and the rabies virus.\nEach of these pathogens requires a different and rapid approach to give patients the best chance of recovery. Encephalitis can present with a wide range of symptoms and outcomes from mild confusion to long term neurological deficits or even death. Understanding the targeted management strategies for these infections is key to navigating this medical emergency.\nTable of Contents\n- HSV Encephalitis: Why Antiviral Treatment Can\u2019t Wait\n- West Nile Virus Encephalitis: A Focus on Supportive Management\n- Rabies Encephalitis: Preventable but Almost Invariably Fatal\n- Common Clinical Features for All Encephalitis\n- Closing Thoughts\n- References\nHSV Encephalitis: Why Antiviral Treatment Can\u2019t Wait\nHerpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) the same virus that causes cold sores is the leading cause of sporadic viral encephalitis in the US. The initial phase of HSV encephalitis is often acute with symptoms developing rapidly and requiring urgent attention. When it gets into the brain it can cause severe damage quickly. The stakes are high with an HSV infection so immediate empiric treatment is an absolute necessity often started based on clinical suspicion alone before diagnostic tests can confirm the cause [5].\nCertain people such as those with weakened immune systems are more likely to get HSV encephalitis. Symptoms may include fever, headache, confusion and can progress to more severe complications including loss of consciousness. Other symptoms can include seizures, personality changes and focal neurological deficits. Severe cases can result in loss of function or even loss of consciousness.\nThe cornerstone of treatment is the antiviral medication acyclovir given intravenously at 10 mg/kg every 8 hours for 14-21 days [2]. Treatments may include additional medications such as corticosteroids to reduce brain swelling and supportive care as needed. The course of treatment can take several weeks depending on the severity of the illness and the person.\nThe urgency cannot be overstated. Any delay in starting acyclovir is associated with higher risk of death and permanent neurological damage. To put it in perspective, randomized studies have shown that the mortality rate with acyclovir treatment is 25% compared to 59% in those who did not receive it [6]. Long term complications can include memory loss and other cognitive impairments so individualized care for each person is essential.\nDiagnosing HSV encephalitis involves a few key tests. A lumbar puncture to analyze cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is essential. Diagnostic workup may include blood tests for markers of infection or immune response. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on the CSF can detect HSV\u2019s genetic material with incredible accuracy, with sensitivity and specificity rates of 96-98% and 95-99% respectively [2].\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred imaging technique as it can show characteristic inflammation often in the temporal lobes of the brain. An electroencephalogram (EEG) which measures the brain\u2019s electrical activity can also provide clues sometimes showing a pattern known as lateralized periodic discharges that points to HSV. Steps to prevent or manage HSV encephalitis include taking precautions to avoid exposure and seeking medical attention if symptoms develop.\nWest Nile Virus Encephalitis: A Focus on Supportive Management\nAs the most common mosquito borne cause of viral encephalitis in the US, West Nile virus, a type of flavivirus, is a significant public health challenge. West Nile virus is a form of infectious encephalitis primarily caused by viruses transmitted through mosquito bites. The incidence of severe neuroinvasive disease is higher in older adults and people with weakened immune systems who are more likely to get serious forms of the illness.\nThere is no antiviral medication proven effective against West Nile virus. Management is focused on supportive care to manage symptoms and prevent complications. Supportive measures may include:\n- Hydration and Nutrition: Getting the person adequate fluids and nutrition often intravenously.\n- Respiratory Support: Some patients may develop respiratory muscle weakness and require mechanical ventilation.\n- Seizure Control: Anticonvulsant medications to manage or prevent seizures.\n- Monitoring Brain Swelling: In severe or acute cases ICP may rise to dangerous levels and require close monitoring and interventions to reduce it. Hospitalization is often required for these patients and the illness can last several weeks.\nAdditional treatments may include various supportive therapies. These may include physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy to help people regain lost functions. Recovery steps can take time and depend on the severity of the illness and the person.\nDiagnosis is confirmed by detecting specific IgM antibodies in the CSF or serum which indicates recent infection. PCR testing can also be used. While MRI findings can vary, involvement of deep brain structures like the basal ganglia or thalamus may suggest WNV encephalitis [3]. The acute phase of the disease can be serious and require urgent medical attention. Neurological complications may affect speech and require therapy as part of rehabilitation. Outcomes vary widely; each person\u2019s recovery is unique and people may experience different long term effects so individualized care is essential.\nRabies Encephalitis: Preventable but Almost Invariably Fatal\nRabies is perhaps the most feared form of viral encephalitis and for good reason. Rabies virus is a well known cause of encephalitis; it is one of the infectious agents that causes encephalitis and specifically rabies virus can cause encephalitis by invading the central nervous system. Once symptoms appear the disease is nearly 100% fatal.\nThis grim prognosis makes prevention the only option as rabies encephalitis is a serious and acute neurological emergency. The focus of management is entirely on post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) a series of interventions given to someone who may have been exposed to the rabies virus from an animal bite or scratch.Symptoms of encephalitis due to rabies may include fever, headache, confusion, agitation, muscle spasms, difficulty swallowing and loss of consciousness.\nOther symptoms may include loss of coordination, hallucinations and paralysis. Loss of consciousness is a serious sign indicating severe neurological involvement. In advanced cases a person with rabies encephalitis will require hospitalization and the illness can progress rapidly over days to weeks and be fatal without urgent medical care.\nAccording to the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines PEP is a multi-step process that must be initiated immediately [1]. The first and most critical step is to thoroughly clean the wound with soap and water to reduce the amount of virus at the site of exposure. This is the key action to take to prevent the virus from causing infection.\nNext Rabies Immune Globulin (RIG) is given. A dose of 20 IU/kg is injected into and around the wound to neutralize the virus before it can enter the nervous system. The final component is a series of vaccinations. The human diploid cell vaccine or purified chick embryo cell vaccine is given in four doses on days 0, 3, 7 and 14 after exposure. This regimen stimulates the body to produce its own antibodies against the virus providing long term protection. As the World Health Organization emphasizes timely and appropriate PEP is highly effective in preventing rabies and can be life saving for the person exposed.\nCommon Clinical Features for All Encephalitis\nRegardless of the suspected cause, certain principles of care apply to all patients with encephalitis. Continuous monitoring for complications like ICP, seizures and respiratory failure is essential as these can arise quickly and require immediate attention [1]. Clinicians must have a high index of suspicion for encephalitis in any patient presenting with unexplained altered behavior, new onset seizures or focal neurological deficits.\nNot all encephalitis is caused by an infection. Autoimmune encephalitis such as anti-NMDAR encephalitis occurs when the immune system attacks healthy brain cells. This is often associated with specific antibodies or tumors. Blood tests to identify these antibodies can help distinguish autoimmune from infectious encephalitis and guide treatment. Autoimmune encephalitis can mimic viral forms and requires a completely different treatment approach involving immunotherapy. This highlights the need for a broad differential diagnosis [7].\nBecause of the deadly potential of untreated HSV, standard practice is to start empiric IV acyclovir in most suspected cases of encephalitis while diagnostic test results are pending [4]. This covers the most common treatable cause without delay.\nClosing Thoughts\nManaging viral encephalitis is a race against time that depends on rapid recognition and etiology specific interventions. For HSV the life saving treatment is urgent acyclovir. For West Nile virus supportive care is key to guiding patients through the illness.\nFor rabies the battle is won before it even starts with post-exposure prophylaxis being the only defense against an otherwise fatal disease. Mistakes or delays in diagnosis and treatment can lead to irreversible brain damage or death so swift decisive action is required in every suspected case.\nFor more information resources like the Encephalitis Society offer valuable resources for patients and healthcare professionals.\nReferences\n[1] Tunkel, A.

      "text": "Abstract\nRabies is a viralzoonosis that causes approximately 50,000 to 100,000 deaths per year worldwide. Most deaths occur in developing countries. Dogs are the major vector, especially in developing countries. The virus is usually transmitted to humans by infected saliva through the bite of a rabid animal; the incubation period averages 30 to 90 d. Hyperexcitability, autonomic dysfunction, hydrophobia, and aerophobia are characteristic of encephalitic rabies, which accounts for 80% of cases. The paralytic form is characterized by flaccid paralysis in the bitten limb, which ascends symmetrically or asymmetrically. Once symptoms develop, the disease is invariably fatal. Animal rabies can be controlled by proper induction of herd immunity, humane removal of stray animals, promotion of responsible pet ownership through education, and enactment of leash laws. Preexposure vaccination with modern cell culture vaccine is recommended for people at high risk of exposure to rabies and for travelers who spend longer than 1 mo in countries where rabies is a constant threat, or who travel in a country where immediate access to appropriate care is limited. Postexposure prophylaxis consists of prompt and thorough wound cleansing and immunization with modern cell culture vaccine, together with administration of rabies immune globulin to those individuals who have not previously received preexposure prophylaxis.\nArticle PDF\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.\nReferences\nHankins DG, Rosekrans JA.

      "text": "Key points\n- Rabies is a viral disease that is deadly if people don't receive medical care before symptoms start.\n- Rabies spreads primarily through bites or scratches from an infected animal.\n- The animals most frequently found with rabies in the U.S. are bats, skunks, raccoons, and foxes.\n- Around 100,000 Americans are vaccinated against rabies following a potential rabies exposure each year.\nWhat you need to know\nRabies is deadly\nRabies is a fatal but preventable viral disease. It can be spread to people and pets through the bites and scratches of an infected animal. Rabies primarily affects the central nervous system, leading to severe brain disease and death if medical care is not received before symptoms start.\nAfter a rabies exposure, the rabies virus must travel to the brain before it can cause symptoms. This time between exposure and the appearance of symptoms is the incubation period, which may last for weeks to months.\nThe first symptoms of rabies may be like the flu, including weakness or discomfort, fever, or headache. There also may be discomfort, prickling, or an itching sensation at the site of the bite. Usually, severe disease appears within two weeks of the first symptoms, when the rabies virus causes anxiety, confusion, agitation, and hallucinations. This includes the \"classic\" rabies symptoms of being very thirsty but panicked by fluids, having lots of saliva, and aggressive behavior like thrashing and biting. Once clinical signs of rabies appear, the disease is nearly always fatal.\nRabies vaccination in people\nIf you may have been exposed to rabies, you should urgently seek medical attention. Medical care following a rabies exposure is called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). PEP includes wound care, human rabies immune globulin (HRIG), and a series of four or five rabies vaccines, which must be given as soon as possible after an exposure. You must get this care to prevent the disease from developing, and it's nearly 100% effective if you get it after exposure.\nThe disease is rare in humans in the United States, with fewer than 10 deaths reported each year. But because it's found in wildlife throughout the country (except for Hawaii), rabies poses a serious public health threat.\nAnimals that carry rabies\nIn the United States, more than 90% of reported cases of rabies in animals occur in wildlife. Rabies is found in many wildlife species, which include:\n- Bats\n- Raccoons\n- Skunks\n- Foxes\nNearly three in four Americans live in a community where animals carry rabies. Contact with infected bats is the leading cause of human rabies deaths in this country; at least seven out of 10 people who die from rabies in the United States were infected by bats.\nRabid dogs in the U.S. are uncommon because of effective rabies prevention and control programs. Around the world, domestic dogs are responsible for more than 95% of the estimated 70,000 human deaths each year.\nPeople at risk\nPeople who are at increased risk for rabies exposures may want to consider pre-exposure vaccination for increased protection.\nPeople who travel\nSince 1990, more than 80 people in the United States have died after being infected with rabies during travel. In Africa, Asia, and specific areas of Central and South America, rabies in dogs is still a major problem. Additionally, access to PEP may be hard to get in those places. As a result, tens of thousands of people die of the disease each year.\nWhen traveling, it is important to keep your distance from wild and unfamiliar animals, including dogs and cats.\nBefore traveling abroad, consult your doctor, a travel clinic, or your local or state health department about your risk of exposure to rabies.\nPeople who participate in certain leisure activities\nPeople who enjoy certain outdoor activities that may lead to contact with wildlife, like spelunking, camping, and hunting are at higher risk of being exposed to rabies.\nPeople who work with animals\nPeople with jobs that involve frequent animal contact are at increased risk of a rabies exposure. These include:\n- Veterinary professionals, including technicians\n- Animal control workers\n- Wildlife researchers or rehabilitation workers\n- Agricultural workers who work closely with animals\nPrevention\nRabies prevention efforts by veterinary, wildlife management, and public health professionals mean that human cases of rabies in the U.S. are rare. Every year, wildlife management professionals distribute more than 5 million oral vaccines to wildlife through baits to control rabies at its source. Veterinarians vaccinate more than 90 million cats and dogs each year. These vaccinations significantly reduce the risk that you or your pets get rabies.\nYou can help prevent rabies by:\n- Making sure your pets are up to date on their rabies vaccines\n- Keeping wildlife wild - stay away from wildlife for both human and animal safety\n- Calling animal control to remove stray animals from your neighborhood\n- Washing bites or scratches immediately with soap and water after possible rabies exposure\n- Seeking medical care urgently if you may have been exposed to rabies\nAround the world, large-scale dog vaccination programs are the most effective way to prevent rabies. However, in many countries, there aren't enough resources to reach all the dogs that need it. CDC works with public and private partners to improve international vaccine access for people and animals, making travel safer and improving global health."

      "text": "Cat Scratching Solutions: Expert Advice to Save Your Sofa\n- Share via\nCat scratching. It\u2019s as natural to felines as purring or chasing a toy. It\u2019s not misbehavior. It\u2019s an instinct that\u2019s essential for their physical and emotional well-being.\nBut when your sofa arms start looking like shredded wheat it\u2019s hard not to get frustrated. Hannah McCoy, owner of Hannah\u2019s Cat Training in Los Angeles, has over 20 years experience in the field. She says scratching is not just necessary for the physical health of your cat but also for mental and emotional well-being. She explains, \u201cCats need to be able to frequently scratch objects in their environment to feel safe in their own territory. It helps them know they are \u2018home\u2019 and it boosts their confidence.\u201d\nScratching lets cats keep their nails healthy, stretch their bodies and leave scent marks. Many cats pick high-traffic spots or sturdy surfaces like couch corners because these are ideal for scent marking and a good stretch. Once a cat starts scratching a particular item it becomes a familiar place and almost a ritual.\nNEWSLETTER\nLooking to adopt or raise a pet? Get expert tips and tricks right in your mailbox.\nProactive Cat Training: The Key to Preventing Unwanted Scratching\nMcCoy emphasizes that scratching is very much a pattern. Like dogs who revisit the same trees on walks, cats return to favorite scratching spots throughout the day. She says, \u201cOnce your cat has started scratching an object, it has their scent deposited. This makes it more difficult to switch them over to the right objects than just preventing it from the get go.\u201d So don\u2019t wait for damage to happen. You need to anticipate your cat\u2019s need to scratch and offer suitable alternatives from the beginning.\nHow to Choose and Place the Best Cat Scratching Posts\nMost cats prefer sisal rope or corrugated cardboard for scratching, but style and placement matter just as much as the material. McCoy points out a common mistake of putting scratching posts far away from furniture in hopes cats will ignore the couch and find the post. She says your cat is naturally going to decide where in your house they want to scratch and if the scratchers you provide are nowhere near there, they will ignore the scratchers and continue scratching the wrong items.\nShe suggests instead placing posts directly beside furniture or areas that your cat will likely want to or have already begun to scratch. These items need to be out in social areas and there need to be several on each level of the house. Ideally at least one in each main room that the cat will spend time in.\nVariety matters too. Some cats prefer vertical posts for a full-body stretch while others like horizontal pads or ramps. Offering multiple styles and making sure each is sturdy and accessible greatly increases your success.\nRedirecting Cat Scratching: How to Train Cats to Use Scratching Posts\nDon\u2019t panic if your cat has already started scratching the wrong spot. Block access to the damaged area using a plastic barrier, furniture cover or rearranging items and immediately place a scratching post or mat nearby. McCoy recommends setting up enticing and desirable scratching items nearby where your cat has shown they already want to do this behavior. Reward them with a treat and praise every time you catch them doing it.\nAdding catnip spray, treats or toys to the new scratcher can make it more appealing. Sticky tape or foil can discourage your cat from returning to the old spot since the texture is unpleasant for their claws.\nTraining Mistakes to Avoid: What Not to Do When Cats Scratch Furniture\nPunishing cats for scratching by yelling, spraying water or clapping doesn\u2019t work and often makes things worse McCoy warns. \u201cThey are not just filing their nails, scratching is actually a very nuanced behavior. When you suddenly get angry and begin chastising them, this is very confusing for them and creates stress and conflict.\u201d In some cases, the attention, even negative, can reinforce the behavior. Instead, focus on positive reinforcement and making the right choices easy for your cat.\nCat Scratching and Stress: Helping Anxious Cats Feel Secure\nIf your cat\u2019s scratching seems excessive or destructive, stress could be the root cause. Scratching is a stress-relieving behavior, McCoy explains. A cat with increased stress absolutely will have a desire to scratch more in an effort to blow off some steam and increase their sense of safety and confidence in their home. Look for changes in the household, new pets or routine disruptions and provide safe quiet zones and consistent routines to help your cat feel secure.\nEssential Tools and Tips to Protect Furniture From Cat Scratching\nNail Trimming: Regularly trimming your cat\u2019s claws as part of the grooming process can minimize damage during the training process.\nNail Caps: Temporary, humane vinyl nail caps are available to help protect surfaces.\nAvoid Declawing: Never declaw. It\u2019s inhumane and in some states illegal. It leads to severe short-term and long-term pain plus behavioral problems.\nMcCoy is clear that it\u2019s a biological and instinctive need and your cat is going to do it. It is up to you to anticipate it and to prevent them from doing it in unwanted areas. Also to proactively ensure they do it in the right areas from the day they arrive in your home. Addressing scratching early and positively can prevent bigger problems like rehoming or surrender for something that was entirely preventable."

      "text": "Pet Travel Has Evolved. Here\u2019s What to Know Before You and Fido Take Flight.\n- Share via\nIt feels like everyone\u2019s bringing their dog, cat or even pet pig on vacation these days. Flexible work schedules, rising pet adoptions and a shift toward slower and more intentional travel. It all means more people are inviting their animals along for the ride.\nWhether you\u2019re flying to Paris with your miniature poodle or road-tripping up the California coast with your rescue mutt, pet travel is more doable, if not a little more complicated, than ever. Airlines are adapting. Hotels are, too. But planning a trip with a pet still comes with its own set of pitfalls to navigate.\nFrom paperwork to crate requirements to how to keep your animal calm in a crowded terminal. These are the things to know before hitting the road with your four-legged bestie.\nNEWSLETTER\nLooking to adopt or raise a pet? Get expert tips and tricks right in your mailbox.\nKnow Before You Go: What\u2019s Changed\nFlying with pets used to be a pretty niche flex. Now that it\u2019s much more common, the rules have changed. Airlines are stricter about how many animals can fly in the cabin. Some routes don\u2019t allow them at all.\nIf you\u2019re flying internationally, expect more prep. For Europe-bound dogs, you\u2019ll need an ISO-compliant microchip, a current rabies vaccination, and a health certificate signed by a USDA-accredited vet. Headed to Japan or Australia? You might need to start the paperwork six months in advance.\nNot sure where to begin? The USDA APHIS pet travel portal and European Commission\u2019s pet movement guide both break things down country by country.\nFinding the Right Airline\u2014and the Right Carrier\nStart with your airline. Some, like JetBlue, offer pet perks and loyalty points. Others are more hands-off. All have different size limits for carriers, so check that first\u2014most require a soft-sided carrier that fits under the seat.\nBook early. Really early. In-cabin spots are limited and often fill up weeks ahead.\nFor large dogs flying cargo, things get trickier. Airlines follow the IATA Live Animals Regulations, which means your crate needs to be ventilated, leakproof, and lockable. Some airlines won\u2019t fly pets in cargo at all during summer due to heat risks.\nDouble-check the fine print. Then check it again.\nCar vs. Plane: It\u2019s Not Always Simpler on the Ground\nDriving gives you control over the schedule but long hours on the road come with their own challenges. Use a harness or secured crate and take breaks every 2 to 3 hours. Keep pets in the back seat. Never leave them alone in the car. And bring printed vet records just in case.\nWhat to Pack When Traveling With Your Pet\nYou don\u2019t need to pack too much luggage, but there are a few key pieces of pet travel gear that will ensure a smooth trip. A soft carrier that meets airline specs. Collapsible bowls. Calming spray (Adaptil for dogs, Feliway for cats). A favorite blanket or toy. And don\u2019t forget something that smells like home.\nIf your pet tends to get anxious, schedule a vet visit a couple of weeks before your trip. Ask about motion sickness meds like Cerenia or calming chews with ingredients like L-theanine.\nBring two copies of your paperwork\u2014one in your bag, one with your pet. It\u2019s a small thing that can save you a lot of stress.\nSmall Surprises (That Happen All the Time)\nEven with the best prep, travel throws curveballs. Flights change. You get rebooked on a plane that doesn\u2019t allow pets. Your \u201cpet-friendly\u201d hotel turns out to only accept dogs under 20 pounds.\nIf your trip has multiple connections or international stops, consider working with a pet relocation service like PetRelocation or Happy Tails Travel. They handle everything from customs paperwork to crate fitting so you can focus on the part where you actually enjoy the trip.\nInternational Travel? Give Yourself More Time Than You Think\nSome countries require blood tests, microchip scans and paperwork submitted months in advance. It\u2019s not difficult, it\u2019s just detailed. Even one typo on a health certificate can derail the best laid plans.\nAlso worth knowing: certain breeds like French bulldogs and Persians may not be allowed to fly in cargo due to respiratory risks. And some airlines won\u2019t allow animals in the cabin at all on long-haul routes.\nWhen It\u2019s Not a Vacation\nSometimes travel isn\u2019t optional. You\u2019re relocating. Bringing a rescue home. Visiting family. In those cases, emotional support animal (ESA) and service dog rules matter more.\nMost airlines have retired ESA policies and now only accept trained service animals with documentation. The Department of Transportation\u2019s latest rule explains exactly what counts.\nEnsuring a Smooth Flight Ahead\nTraveling with pets is absolutely possible for the owner on the go. It just requires smart and thorough research and planning. The more you know up front, the less you\u2019ll have to troubleshoot on the go.\nStart early. Bring backup copies. Ask questions. Stay flexible. And remember, your dog doesn\u2019t care about flight delays or middle seats. They just want to be near you."

      "text": "Ditch the Sticks: A Safe, Healthy Chew Guide for Dog Owners\n- Share via\nIf your dog loves to chew on sticks in the yard, you\u2019re not alone. It\u2019s a classic dog thing, but it\u2019s also a surprisingly risky habit. Vets warn that dogs who eat sticks are risking splinters in the mouth, intestinal blockages or worse. Plus, some types of wood are toxic or coated in chemicals. Despite their appealing woodsy smell, sticks are simply not a safe chew option.\nThe good news is that there are many healthier, safer alternatives in stores that are designed specifically for your dog\u2019s chewing instincts. Whether you\u2019re looking for a long-lasting chew for a tough-jawed adult or a softer option for a new puppy or a senior pet, the information below can help you find the perfect match.\nNEWSLETTER\nLooking to adopt or raise a pet? Get expert tips and tricks right in your mailbox.\nThe Chewing Instinct More Than Just a Hobby\nChewing is vital for a dog\u2019s well-being. A good dog chew promotes dental health by helping to reduce tartar buildup and keeps their mouth clean. Chewing also satisfies behavioral needs and is a fantastic way to relieve boredom, stress and anxiety.\nFor aggressive chewers especially, finding the right chew is critical to saving your furniture and avoiding the ingestion of dangerous objects. A chew tailored to your dog\u2019s size, chewing style and preferences can make all the difference.\nThe Health Benefits of Chewing\nThe right chew can do more then protect your belongings. It\u2019s also a powerful tool for your dog\u2019s overall health. A good chew can scrape plaque from your dog\u2019s teeth and support healthy gums. It can also provide mental stimulation, which helps reduce boredom and keep your dog busy. For nervous pups the act of chewing can help them stay calm. And for puppies, softer chews are great for soothing sore gums and protecting their new teeth.\nThe Great Chew Buffet\nWith no one-size-fits-all chew, there are many great options to consider based on your needs:\nBully Sticks\nA perennial favorite among dog owners, these are made from natural ingredients and offer a satisfying texture for aggressive chewers.\nYak Cheese Chews\nSourced from traditional Himalayan recipes, yak cheese is known for being both long-lasting and easily digestible.\nDental Chews\nThese specially designed treats help remove plaque and tartar and leave your dog\u2019s breath smelling fresh.\nRawhide\nPopular but controversial, rawhide can break into large chunks and pose a choking hazard or digestive risk. It\u2019s often best to avoid.\nHuman-Made Edible Bones\nThese are formulated to break down safely and often come fortified with added nutrients for joint or dental health.\nOther Animal Parts\nChews made from antlers or hooves are natural, but they may be too hard for some dogs, especially those with dental issues.\nWhat Makes the Perfect Chew?\nThe best chew for your dog meets a few key criteria. It should be made from natural ingredients, with no artificial additives or fillers. It needs to be the right size for your dog. A chew that\u2019s too small is a choking risk. It should also be suited to their chewing style. Some dogs nibble gently. Others will tear through anything put in front of them. The perfect chew is easily digestible (especially for dogs with sensitive stomachs) and durable, helping to manage energy and destructive behavior.\nHow to Choose the Right Chew\nTo choose the right chew you must understand your dog\u2019s specific needs. A puppy needs softer chew toys, while an adult dog might prefer something more durable. If your dog has a medical issue or a condition like pica (eating non-food objects), your vet will have specific recommendations. And of course every dog has its own preferences. Some love a smoky bone smell. Others prefer something with less scent. Consult with your vet who can give you advice when introducing new chews.\nGolden Rules For Safe Chewing\nNo matter how safe a chew seems, always supervise your dog, especially when giving them a new product. Discard chews that are small enough to swallow or show signs of breaking. Remember to never let your dog chew on real sticks, bones or anything not made for dogs. Always watch for signs of distress, like vomiting, diarrhea or difficulty chewing.\nCreative Chew Alternatives & Life Stages\nFor dogs with dietary restrictions or picky tastes, there are some great alternatives. A frozen Kong stuffed with peanut butter or other dog-safe foods is a fantastic cooling chew option. You can also make your own treats like dried sweet potato slices or carrot sticks. Durable rubber or puzzle toys can also offer mental stimulation and oral benefits."

      "text": "Hypoallergenic Large Dogs: Big Breeds That Won\u2019t Cover Your Couch in Fur\n- Share via\nFor pet parents who love big dog breeds but want to avoid constant cleanup, low-shedding dogs can be a perfect match. Whether you suffer from allergies or just prefer a cleaner home, choosing a hypoallergenic dog breed with minimal shedding means less dog hair on your clothes, furniture, and floors.\nWhile no dog is truly 100% hypoallergenic, several large dog breeds come close. These breeds often produce less pet dander and shed very little loose fur, making them ideal for allergy sufferers.\nNEWSLETTER\nLooking to adopt or raise a pet? Get expert tips and tricks right in your mailbox.\nStill, these large hypoallergenic dogs require regular grooming and frequent brushing to keep their coats clean and tangle-free. Let\u2019s dive into the best options for no shed large breed dogs, including details about temperament, grooming needs, and suitability for different households.\nGiant Schnauzer\nThe Giant Schnauzer is one of the most iconic schnauzer breeds and a favorite among those looking for non shedding breeds. With its dense wiry coat, this breed sheds very little but requires regular brushing and occasional trips to a professional groomer to maintain its shape.\nOriginally bred as a guard dog and cattle herder in Germany, the Giant Schnauzer is strong-willed, intelligent, and protective. They\u2019re best suited for active families who can offer consistent training and ample physical activity. This breed thrives on structure and loves a job to do. While affectionate with their families, they may be reserved around strangers. Common health concerns include hip dysplasia and eye issues.\nWith their loyal nature and hypoallergenic coat, Giant Schnauzers are an excellent choice for experienced owners looking for large dogs that don\u2019t shed.\nPortuguese Water Dog\nAs a classic water dog breed, the Portuguese Water Dog has a dense curly coat that\u2019s both hypoallergenic and low shedding. These dogs need frequent brushing and professional grooming every few weeks to prevent mats and tangles, but they\u2019re among the best dogs that don\u2019t shed excessively.\nOriginally bred to assist Portuguese fishermen, this breed is active, intelligent, and eager to please. They love swimming, hiking, and anything that involves bonding with their humans. Portuguese Water Dogs are fantastic with kids and make excellent family pets, but their high energy levels demand regular exercise.\nBecause they\u2019re a hypoallergenic dog, they\u2019re ideal for households looking to minimize pet dander without sacrificing personality or companionship.\nIrish Water Spaniel\nThe Irish Water Spaniel is an ancient dog breed and one of the rarest spaniels recognized by the American Kennel Club. With a tight, waterproof coat of ringlets, this hypoallergenic breed sheds very little and is often considered one of the top breeds that don\u2019t shed. Like others on this list, however, it benefits from weekly brushing and professional grooming to maintain coat health.\nSpirited, eager to work, and a little mischievous, Irish Water Spaniels are best suited for active individuals or families. They\u2019re smart, trainable, and naturally protective, but they can be aloof with strangers. They\u2019re happiest when mentally stimulated and given tasks to complete. Health concerns include potential thyroid issues and hip dysplasia.\nIf you\u2019re drawn to a unique large hypoallergenic dog with personality and charm, the Irish Water Spaniel is a worthy contender.\nAfghan Hound\nElegant and independent, the Afghan Hound boasts a silky long coat that surprisingly qualifies it as one of the low shedding dogs. Though its luxurious appearance might suggest high maintenance, this ancient breed sheds minimally and produces little pet dander. However, keeping that flowing silky hair free of mats requires frequent brushing and grooming.\nAfghan Hounds have a quiet dignity and are known for their aloof yet loyal personalities. They aren\u2019t typically \u201ceager to please,\u201d which can make training a bit of a challenge for first-time dog owners. That said, their gentle nature and striking appearance make them a favorite among enthusiasts of more refined dog breeds. They benefit from daily walks and space to stretch their legs.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a hypoallergenic dog with a dramatic flair and little shedding, the Afghan Hound is hard to beat.\nKomondor\nThe Komondor is unmistakable with its signature corded coat, resembling long dreadlocks. While this coat may appear heavy, it actually sheds very little\u2014making the Komondor one of the more unusual no shed large breed dogs. Maintaining the cords, however, is a unique commitment, requiring special care and drying time after baths.\nOriginally bred to guard livestock, the Komondor has a calm, independent temperament and a natural protective instinct. They\u2019re incredibly loyal but can be wary of strangers and other animals without early socialization. Daily exercise and training are important to balance their instincts.\nAlthough their grooming requirements are complex, Komondors are great for those looking for a one-of-a-kind large hypoallergenic dog with a strong work ethic.\nBlack Russian Terrier\nDeveloped in the mid-20th century for military purposes, the Black Russian Terrier is a powerful, confident breed with a thick double coat that sheds minimally. This breed benefits from weekly brushing to remove loose fur and prevent mats.\nThese dogs are intelligent, reserved, and deeply devoted to their families. While their guard dog roots make them protective, they\u2019re generally calm and easygoing at home. Early training and socialization are key to bringing out their best qualities. Common health issues include hip and elbow dysplasia.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a loyal, low-shedding giant with presence and brains, the Black Russian Terrier is a standout among large dog breeds.\nBonus Mentions\nOther terrier breeds worth noting include the Airedale Terrier and Kerry Blue Terrier, both medium-to-large dogs with wiry coats that shed very little. While not as large as others on this list, they are bigger than most small hypoallergenic dogs and still offer a robust, energetic presence.\nHairless breeds like the Mexican Hairless Dog (Xoloitzcuintli) and Peruvian Hairless Dog (Peruvian Inca Orchid) also appeal to those looking for dogs that don\u2019t shed. These hairless and coated varieties require very little grooming, though they do need skin care and sun protection.\nHow to Choose the Best Large Dog That Doesn\u2019t Shed\nChoosing from the many low shedding dog breeds available doesn\u2019t mean giving up your dream of owning a large dog. Whether you\u2019re drawn to the Giant Schnauzer\u2019s protective instincts, the Portuguese Water Dog\u2019s athleticism, or the Afghan Hound\u2019s graceful stride, there\u2019s a hypoallergenic dog that fits your home and heart.\nJust remember: less shedding doesn\u2019t mean no upkeep. Most of these breeds need regular brushing, exercise, and socialization to thrive. But for those who can commit, no shed large breed dogs offer the best of both worlds\u2014big love, low mess."

      "text": "How Hot Is Too Hot? Recognizing and Responding to Heat Stress in Dogs\n- Share via\nIt\u2019s easy to forget that while we\u2019re enjoying the sun, our dogs are experiencing heat in a completely different and more dangerous way. They can\u2019t tell us when they\u2019re too hot, so it\u2019s our job to recognize the warning signs and make sure they stay safe. Overheating can escalate from heat exhaustion to full-blown heat stroke in a flash. It\u2019s something every dog owner needs to be on the lookout for.\nSo how hot is too hot? A simple rule of thumb: if it feels uncomfortably hot to you, it\u2019s likely already crossed the danger zone for your dog.\nNEWSLETTER\nLooking to adopt or raise a pet? Get expert tips and tricks right in your mailbox.\nWhat To Understand About A Dog\u2019s Cooling System\nUnlike us, dogs don\u2019t cool down by sweating. Instead, they rely on panting and tiny sweat glands in their paws to regulate their body temperature. A healthy dog\u2019s temperature is naturally a little higher than ours, sitting between 100.5\u00b0F and 102.5\u00b0F. But if it climbs much higher, especially during exercise, it can trigger a chain reaction of internal stress that leads to heat exhaustion. Left unchecked, this can quickly become heat stroke.\nSome dogs are at an even higher risk. Small dogs, senior pups, flat-faced breeds (like Bulldogs and Pugs), and young puppies can overheat much faster. Humidity also plays a huge role because it makes it harder for a dog\u2019s panting to do its job.\nThe Unseen Dangers of Summer\nIt\u2019s not just the air temperature you have to worry about. Pavement, asphalt and even sand can absorb heat and become hot enough to burn a dog\u2019s paws in seconds. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, when the air temperature is just 87\u00b0F, asphalt can be a scorching 143\u00b0F. That\u2019s more than enough to cause second-degree burns.\nSo before you head out you should use the \u201c7-second rule\u201d: if you can\u2019t comfortably hold the back of your hand on the pavement for seven seconds, it\u2019s too hot for your dog\u2019s paws. To avoid injury, stick to grassy areas and shaded trails. Or if you need to hit the pavement, schedule your walks for early in the morning or after the sun has gone down.\nPerhaps the most dangerous summer mistake of all? Leaving a dog in a car. Even with the windows cracked, temperatures inside a car can jump by 20 degrees in just 10 minutes. That turns a vehicle into a deadly trap in no time.\nHow to Be a Cool Dog Owner\nKeeping your dog safe is all about being proactive. Always have fresh, cool water on hand\u2014in the house, in the backyard and on the go. Provide plenty of shade when you\u2019re outside. And during the hottest part of the day, keep your pup indoors with a fan or the air conditioning on.\nYou can also use some cool tools to help. A dog cooling mat gives them a great place to rest, especially if you don\u2019t have AC. You can get dog cooling vests or offer some frozen chew toys for a fun way to beat the heat. And remember to give your dog a little shade in the backyard. Even a short break from the sun can make a world of difference.\nThe Red Flags: Recognizing Heat Stroke\nRecognizing the symptoms of overheating is critical. Watch for early signs like excessive panting, drooling, glazed eyes, red or pale gums and rapid breathing. In a more serious case, your dog may become unsteady, vomit, collapse or even lose consciousness.\nDo not ignore these warnings. If you see any of these signs, move your dog immediately to a shaded or air-conditioned space. Offer small amounts of cool water and apply damp towels to their body. The key is cool but not ice-cold. That can cause shock. Most importantly you need to call your veterinarian or an emergency animal hospital right away.\nHeat Exhaustion vs. Heat Stroke\nHeat exhaustion and heat stroke are two stages of the same dangerous problem. Heat exhaustion is the early stage with heavy panting, fatigue and some disorientation.\nCaught early you can often treat it with rest, water and a cool environment. But if you let it go it can quickly escalate into full-blown heat stroke, which is a medical emergency that requires immediate professional help. It\u2019s always better to err on the side of caution. When in doubt go to the vet.\nStaying Safe in the Heat\nSo, how hot is too hot for dogs? If you\u2019re sweating and uncomfortable, your dog probably is too\u2014and they may not have the tools to cool themselves down. Summer safety isn\u2019t complicated, but it does require awareness and some planning. With the right routine, some smart tools and a watchful eye, you can enjoy the summer with your dog safely by your side."
