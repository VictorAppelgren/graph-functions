  "content": "The big picture: Google's ambitions in the smart TV market have reached a critical juncture as the company quietly shifts its revenue strategy for Google TV, amid persistent struggles to monetize the platform effectively. Despite notable user growth and annual investments in the hundreds of millions of dollars, Google is confronting harsh economic realities in a space dominated by fierce competitors like Amazon and Roku.\n\nGoogle TV's core issues revolve around advertising, the financial engine for most smart TV platforms. Historically, Google followed the standard industry model: publishers seeking inclusion on Google TV had to give up a portion of their advertising inventory, allowing Google to sell those ad slots directly. This model, similar to those used by Roku and Vizio, enabled platform operators to generate revenue in exchange for maintaining the software ecosystem.\n\nHowever, multiple sources familiar with the matter told The Verge's Janko Roettgers that, last year, Google abruptly changed course. The company handed control of those coveted ad slots back to publishers and now only takes a share of the resulting revenue, no longer dictating or directly supplying ads.\n\nThis move is widely seen as a tacit acknowledgment that content providers are more effective at selling their own inventory, something Google had long resisted admitting.\n\nThis shift marks a significant, if implicit, concession: Google \u2013 one of the world's most powerful advertising companies \u2013 has not yet cracked the code for monetizing advertising on its own television platform. While Google TV has grown rapidly in market share since the 2020 consolidation of Android TV and Chromecast under a single brand, reaching 270 million monthly active devices by late 2024 according to the company, much of that growth has come from overseas markets, where monetization is far more limited.\n\nAdditionally, a significant portion of Google TV's global presence consists of operator-customized versions that provide limited opportunities for Google to profit, according to sources cited by Roettgers.\n\nRival strategies have further complicated Google's efforts. Amazon, for instance, has secured valuable retail shelf space at major chains like Costco by paying so-called \"bounties\" of up to $50 per Fire TV device sold, according to sources. Put in perspective that highly capable Fire TV 4K sticks currently sell for as little as $30.\n\nWhile Amazon declined to comment on specific terms, these aggressive subsidies have made it harder for Google to match such incentives. Google has paid similar bounties to hardware makers and retailers, but not at Amazon's scale.\n\nAs a result, debate is intensifying within Google over how much more money should be funneled into Google TV to maintain relevance. Some employees and executives reportedly view the cost of competing with Amazon's incentives as unsustainable, particularly as profitability remains elusive.\n\nWhen asked for comment, Shalini Govil-Pai, Google's VP and general manager of TV platforms, issued a statement emphasizing the company's focus on innovation, user experience, and continued investment in Google TV. She highlighted high user ratings and global reach but did not address the platform's profitability.\n\nComplicating matters, YouTube has continued to surge in popularity and is undoubtedly Google's crown jewel in TV-based streaming. In February 2025, it accounted for a record 11.6% of all US TV viewing, according to Nielsen, and generated $9.8 billion in ad revenue in the previous quarter.\n\nThis explosive growth has reportedly shifted internal priorities. Google's sales teams are increasingly focused on YouTube, which has become so popular that it no longer relies on Google's own TV hardware to strike valuable deals with partners. Some YouTube executives have openly questioned whether continued investment in Google TV is worthwhile, especially when those resources could be more profitably redirected to YouTube.\n\nSigns of retrenchment are already visible. Reporting from The Information and sources interviewed by Roettgers indicate that Google has implemented budget cuts for Google TV, affecting both staff and the retail bounties required to remain competitive. The company is also said to be seeking shorter terms on these costly commercial agreements.\n\nDespite these challenges, a full retreat from the smart TV space appears unlikely.\n\nGoogle TV may remain part of the company's broader consumer strategy, but as economic pressures mount and competition intensifies, insiders suggest the platform could evolve into a smaller, less ambitious endeavor. It may come to resemble Apple's historically limited approach to televisions: strategically important, but ultimately a costly side project rather than a core business.",

      "text": "Last year, Google surprised online video publishers with some stunning news: the company, which now generates over a quarter trillion dollars with advertising every year, effectively admitted that it isn\u2019t very good at selling ads for its own smart TV platform, Google TV.\nThe issue at heart: Google has long required publishers to share a percentage of their ad inventory to be on Google TV. It\u2019s a common industry practice. Companies like Roku or Vizio routinely sell a subset of the ad spots you see when you watch videos from third-party publishers on their smart TVs, and they pocket the money as compensation for operating their smart TV platforms.\nBut Google changed course on its own deals with publishers out of the blue and gave previously requested ad spots back to them, I was able to confirm with three sources with knowledge of those changes. The company is now just asking for a cut of their ad revenue \u2014 a tacit admission that these companies are better at selling their own advertising.\nThe policy change is just the latest example of something that has plagued Google for a long time: after growing Google TV into a major smart TV platform, Google has struggled to monetize it. The company has been spending hundreds of millions of dollars on Google TV every year, but it has yet to break even on those efforts, I\u2019ve been told by two sources with knowledge of the issue. And with costs exploding, the company now finds itself at a crossroads, forced to decide how much it is willing to pay to stay relevant in the smart TV space.\nGoogle TV grew fast, but monetization is lacking\nGoogle\u2019s current smart TV efforts reach back all the way to 2014, when it launched Android TV as a way to bring Android to the living room. Those efforts were supercharged in 2020, when it unified Chromecast and Android TV under the Google TV banner, complete with a new TV UI that put a bigger emphasis on content discovery. The plan, I\u2019ve been told, was to follow the company\u2019s mobile playbook: invest in scale first and then ramp up monetization.\nGoogle\u2019s TV team has arguably succeeded with the first part of that mission. The company announced a milestone of 270 million monthly active smart TVs and TV-connected devices last September; one source in the know told me that it has likely surpassed the 300 million mark since then.\nHowever, many of those devices are in overseas markets that are much more difficult to monetize, and a good chunk are running what\u2019s known as the Android TV operator tier \u2014 a version of Android\u2019s smart TV software that can be heavily customized by pay TV operators and often leaves little, if any, room for Google to make any money.\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for Google to have a foothold in the North American smart TV market, where it has partnered with companies like Sony, TCL, and Hisense to run Google TV on their TV sets. However, doing so comes with significant costs \u2014 and it is only getting more expensive, thanks to some aggressive moves from Google\u2019s archrival Amazon.\nLast year, Amazon announced it would begin selling Hisense-made Fire TVs at Costco. Left out of the announcement was the fact that these TVs would be replacing Hisense-made TVs running Google TV.\nAmazon was able to boot Google from Costco\u2019s shelves by spending heavily on something that is known in the industry as bounties: every time Costco sells a Hisense Fire TV, Amazon sends some money to Hisense and Costco. The exact terms of those deals are confidential, but I\u2019ve been told by two sources that Amazon likely ends up paying as much as $50 total per activated TV. Amazon declined to comment when contacted for this story.\nGoogle has been paying these kinds of bounties to TV makers and select retailers, as well, but not at Amazon\u2019s levels. Faced with the prospect of having to dole out much more money to retain shelf space and keep hardware partners happy, some in the company are now questioning whether Google TV is really worth it.\n\u201cThe success of our platforms is rooted in the success and scale of our partners, app developers and services, including our own,\u201d said Shalini Govil-Pai, Google\u2019s vice president and general manager of TV platforms, when contacted for comment for this story. \u201cWhile we may have specific business arrangements with our partners, our focus is and has always been to lead in product innovation and user experience. This is reflected in high user ratings and a global reach of over 270 million monthly active users. We continue to invest in Google TV because we believe the TV remains the center for families to gather and be entertained.\u201d\nYouTube doesn\u2019t need Google TV\nAll of that is happening as YouTube is seeing massive success in the living room: TV-based YouTube viewing has skyrocketed in recent years. The video service accounted for 12.5 percent of all TV viewing in the US this May, and now makes up 25 percent of all TV-based streaming. YouTube\u2019s ad revenue was $9.8 billion last quarter.\nIn light of that, Google\u2019s salespeople are prioritizing YouTube over Google TV, which was one reason for the decision to change revenue-sharing terms with publishers. And while having its own smart TV platform was initially seen as a bargaining chip in negotiations to get YouTube onto third-party devices, there\u2019s now little need for that: YouTube has become so huge that it can effectively dictate contract terms to other device makers. As a result, YouTube executives have shown little interest in Google TV, with some openly arguing that Google would be better off spending Google TV\u2019s budget on YouTube instead.\nThere are already signs that Google is rethinking its spending on Google TV: The Information first reported about budget cuts affecting Google TV in June. But while that report largely focused on layoffs, I\u2019ve been told by multiple sources that the number of people let go was actually in line with the company\u2019s broader cutbacks across its devices and services unit. The real issue, I\u2019ve been told by three sources, is a growing discomfort within Google to keep footing the bill for Google TV\u2019s retail shelf space bounties.\nFor the time being, the company is still paying these bounties. However, a source with knowledge of those conversations told me that Google has been looking for shorter terms for the kinds of commercial agreements with TV makers that govern bounties, indicating that it may scale back its investment level on those bounties in the near future.\nWhat comes then is anyone\u2019s guess. It\u2019s unlikely that Google would abandon its TV efforts altogether. But with a much smaller budget and unable to effectively compete with companies like Roku and Amazon, there is a possibility that the company could treat smart TVs similar to the way Apple has long approached the space: as little more than an expensive hobby.\nThis is Lowpass by Janko Roettgers, a column on the ever-evolving intersection of tech and entertainment, syndicated just for The Verge subscribers once a week."
