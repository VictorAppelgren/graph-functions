      "feedback": "The draft covers a broad set of themes but fails to deliver a tight, testable 0–3 week narrative with a clear causal chain and market transmission. Actionable edits: reorganize into a single, compact 0–3 week frame with explicit sections: Immediate drivers (Las Vegas pricing/frictions; 6OOEK8TUR), near-term catalysts (Labor Day promos; 6U8VYS7BA), and near-term market transmission (consumer discretionary/hospitality margins; autos pricing via tariffs; 6OOEK8TUR, S15934PBQ, 6U8VYS7BA). Build a concrete causal map tying each driver to an observable market response (e.g., Vegas pricing pain -> weaker Strip footfall and hotel occupancy; tariff pass-through -> higher auto prices and marginal inflation; Labor Day cycles -> transient retail lift in durables). Quantify every driver with numbers from sources: Vegas items (Diet Coke $15, water $26, nachos $40; 6OOEK8TUR); promo sizes (Pottery Barn Indio 8‑piece $2,794 to $2,235; 20% off) and other promo anchors (Pottery Barn/early Labor Day markdowns; 6U8VYS7BA); tariff moves (27.5% to 15%); Beasley economics (pre‑agmt three-year, $42M plan; max $7.2M with non‑Bird; Nets/Kings/Wizards/cap-space numbers from XB5ZRN1VP, S15934PBQ). Attach after every claim a source ID and reconcile conflicts by presenting both sides with stated bounds (e.g., tariff pass-through denial vs Nikkei data in 615934PBQ; Beasley investigation status vs market options in  XB5ZRN1VP and ESPN sources). Add a concise “Levels/thresholds and invalidation” line: e.g., if Vegas ADR/occupancy fails to recover toward prior month by week 2, if auto CPI readings show autos pricing still rising post‑tariff, if Beasley signs for near $7.2M vs >$10–15M offers, then revise the base-case perception; otherwise, treat as limited upside with a seasonal lift. Strengthen the monitoring list with concrete datapoints and dates (Las Vegas tourism data releases; Labor Day weekend sales results; tariff headlines/OMB/CPI prints; Beasley free-agent status updates). Improve narrative cohesion by tying the tech/durable goods signal (BeeStation Plus at $400 for 8TB) to a broader theme of substitution away from recurring subscriptions, ensuring it’s presented as a pocket of durable demand rather than a macro driver; cite 9 and 8VMO3PFEO for the BeeStation signal. Finally, tighten prose to avoid hedging and generic statements, and ensure every assertion maps to a near-term, observable market response; the updated piece should read as a testable, hypothesis-driven micro‑milestone update rather than a diffuse panorama.",
