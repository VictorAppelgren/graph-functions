  "description": "Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - August 12, 2025) - Northwest Healthcare Properties Real Estate Investment Trust (TSX: NWH.UN) (the \"REIT\" or \"Northwest\"), a global investor and operator of healthcare infrastructure assets in North America, Australasia, Brazil, and Europe, announces results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025.

  "content": "Strong operating performance in Q2 2025 was supported by a stable, long-term lease maturity profile with a weighted-average lease expiry (\"WALE\") of 13.5 years and a global portfolio occupancy rate of 97%.\n\nThe REIT's leverage was 48.5% at the end of Q2 2025, as compared to 50.0% as at December 31, 2024, driven by proactive debt repayment from dispositions; and\n\nDuring Q2 2025, the REIT recorded fair value gains on investment properties of $13.6 million, compared to fair value losses of $172.4 million in Q2 2024. The fair value movements were mainly attributable to changes in valuation parameters, incorporating market evidence when available and rent reviews. The REIT's portfolio cap rate as at June 30, 2025 is 6.3%;\n\nAdjusted funds from operations (\"AFFO\") was $0.10 per unit in Q2 2025 compared to $0.10 per unit in Q1 2025 and $0.09 per unit in Q2 2024, resulting in an AFFO payout ratio of 88% in Q2 2025 compared to 92% in Q1 2025 and 105% in Q2 2024 (see Exhibit 2);\n\nNet income for Q2 2025 was $32.6 million compared to net loss of $127.2 million in Q2 2024, primarily due to a decrease in mortgage and loan interest expense, positive fair value adjustment on investment properties, and unrealized foreign exchange gains, partially offset by fair value loss on revaluation of financial instruments and by lower net operating income as a result of disposition activity;\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses, excluding unit-based compensation and employee termination benefits and associated costs, were $12.6 million for Q2 2025, a decrease of $0.5 million from Q2 2024, primarily due to headcount reduction and simplification of the REIT's business;\n\nSame Property Net Operating Income (\"SPNOI\") increased by 2.8% to $73.2 million for Q2 2025, over Q2 2024, reflecting steady growth across all regions (see Exhibit 1);\n\nRevenue from investment properties was $99.0 million for Q2 2025, a decrease of 16.9% from Q2 2024 driven by the disposition of non-core assets during 2024 and 2025 to date, partially offset by solid same property revenue growth;\n\nHighlights for Q2 2025 and events subsequent to the quarter are set out below:\n\n\"Looking ahead, we're focused on disciplined capital allocation and unlocking value through strategic asset management and selective dispositions. This will provide us with flexibility to further reduce debt, reinvest in our core portfolio, and pursue accretive growth opportunities that drive long-term value for unitholders.\"\n\n\"Our Q2 2025 results reflect continued operational momentum, with improvements in AFFO per unit, a lower payout ratio, and continued execution of our capital recycling strategy with over $282 million in non-core asset sales completed year to date.\n\nZachary Vaughan, CEO of Northwest, commented, \"Having just joined Northwest in July, I am excited by the caliber of the portfolio and the strength of the team. The assets we own and operate are critical components of healthcare infrastructure. Our assets have long-term demand drivers, recession-resistant cash flows and very low obsolescence risk. Our cash flows are backed by outstanding underlying credit, often government supported, with long-term indexation. Given Northwest's unique position as a leader in healthcare infrastructure, we are well positioned for future growth.\n\nToronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - August 12, 2025) - Northwest Healthcare Properties Real Estate Investment Trust (TSX: NWH.UN) (the \"REIT\" or \"Northwest\"), a global investor and operator of healthcare infrastructure assets in North America, Australasia, Brazil, and Europe, announces results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025. In addition, the REIT announces the suspension of its distribution reinvestment plan (the \"DRIP\") and the appointment of Zachary Vaughan to the Board of Trustees (the \"Board\").\n\nThe REIT's consolidated SPNOI increased by 2.8% in Q2 2025 compared to the prior year period, driven mainly by inflationary rent adjustments, rentalised capital spend, and improved recoveries reflecting steady growth in the REIT's underlying lease income. Regionally, SPNOI increased by 2.0% in North America, 4.6% in Brazil, 2.3% in Europe, and 2.6% in Australasia (see Exhibit 1).\n\nIn Q2 2025, the REIT completed 298,000 square feet of new, renewal and early leasing, achieving a strong renewal rate of 89%.\n\nAs previously disclosed, in March 2025, following sector margin pressures exacerbated by its capital structure, Healthscope Pty Ltd (\"HSO\"), the REIT's second largest tenant, occupying 12 properties and accounting for 6.1% of the REIT's proportionate revenues, requested temporary relief from its lender syndicate and landlords, including Northwest. In May 2025, HSO's parent entities entered receivership, with its lenders appointing McGrathNicol Restructuring to work with HSO management to complete an orderly sale of the business. All hospitals continue to operate as usual, and the company has received an additional A$100m facility to support operations.\n\nIn July 2025, (i) the HSO receiver repaid 50% of the previously announced rent deferral accrued to June 30, 2025, and (ii) Northwest agreed to an updated rent deferral arrangement with the HSO receiver starting July 1st whereby 10% of ongoing rent will be deferred. All deferrals are expected to be repaid by March 31, 2026 or upon completion of sale of material assets. The deferred rent has priority over senior debt.\n\nThe receiver-led sale process commenced in late July, and it is anticipated that a new owner will be confirmed in Q4 2025, with the transition process and timing of regulatory approvals to be determined. Northwest maintains constructive dialogue with the receiver and ongoing discussions with prospective operators participating in the process.\n\nAs of today, all rent owing to the REIT from HSO (other than the rent subject to rent deferral arrangements) has been paid and HSO continues to meet all lease obligations.\n\nThe REIT's capital recycling during the quarter, including subsequent events, has generated over $231 million of proceeds as detailed below.\n\nDuring Q2 2025, the REIT sold its shares in Assura through two on-market transactions for total proceeds of $209.3 million (\u00a3114.7 million) resulting in a full divestment of the shares. The REIT's investment in Assura was acquired as partial consideration for the REIT's disposition of its UK portfolio in August 2024 at a value of $177 million (\u00a3100 million), resulting in a gain on disposition of approximately $32.3 million (\u00a314.6 million). Proceeds were used to repay related debt and corporate facilities.\n\nIn Q2 2025, the REIT completed the sale of one income producing property in North America, one development property in Europe, and one development property in Australasia, classified as assets held for sale at their fair value of $22.1 million. The proceeds were used to repay directly attributable debt and outstanding balances on credit facilities.\n\nAs at June 30, 2025, the REIT held one income producing property with a value of $34.3 million as classified as held for sale.\n\nDuring the quarter, the REIT also extended or refinanced several debt facilities including Canadian mortgages and Australasian term loans.\n\nOn July 29, 2025, the REIT amended the terms of its revolving credit facility. The amendment extends the maturity date of the facility to July 2027 and moves the REIT to grid pricing based on its credit rating, reducing the REIT's cost of borrowing by 65 basis points. The amendment also provides a $100 million accordion commitment, subject to incremental security and lender approval, that provides the REIT flexibility with mortgage maturities as it transitions away from amortizing debt. Subsequent to quarter end, the REIT repaid Canadian mortgages totaling $40.8 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 2.67%, using capacity on its revolving credit facility.\n\nAs of today, the REIT has $20.9 million of Canadian mortgages with 2025 maturities that will be repaid with capacity from the revolving credit facility and $11.7 million of European mortgages that will be renewed in the ordinary course. Of the REIT's proportionate 2026 debt maturities totaling $424 million, over 50% or approximately $226 million are maturing in the fourth quarter of 2026, with the remainder relating to mortgages. The REIT currently has approximately $230 million of available liquidity, consisting of cash and the unused portion of its credit facilities.\n\n(1) FFO and AFFO are not measures recognized under IFRS and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS. See Performance Measurement in the REIT's MD&A. The adjustments to determine FFO and AFFO have been presented on a proportionate basis. See \"Non-IFRS Financial Measures\", Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 2.\n\n(2) Included in FFO and AFFO for the six months ended June 30, 2024, is $6.7 million related to interest rate cap derivative arrangements, which matured during the three months ended March 31, 2024, the impact of which is $0.03 per unit.\n\n(3) For the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, FFO and FFO per unit excludes $1.4 million and $3.4 million of accelerated amortization of deferred financing charges due to the early repayment of debt using proceeds from the sale of Assura units during the quarter and the issuance of the $500 million senior unsecured debentures in February 2025. FFO and FFO per unit including accelerated amortization of deferred financing charges is $28.0 million or $0.11 per unit and $54.1 million or $0.22 per unit, respectively.\n\nThe REIT also announces today that it has suspended its DRIP until further notice. The REIT's unit price continues to trade at a meaningful discount to net asset value (\"NAV\") per unit, and the issuance of units under the DRIP runs counter to the REIT's focus of optimizing capital structure and driving superior growth in NAV per unit and returns over time.\n\nCommencing with the September 2025 distribution (payable on or about October 15, 2025), unitholders enrolled in the DRIP will receive distribution payments in cash. If the REIT elects to reinstate the DRIP in the future, unitholders that were enrolled in the DRIP at the time of its suspension and remain enrolled at the time of its reinstatement will automatically resume participation in the DRIP.\n\nAppointment of Zachary Vaughan to the Board of Trustees\n\nThe REIT is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. Zachary Vaughan, the REIT's current CEO, to the Board effective today, August 12, 2025, as a non-independent trustee. Mr. Vaughan's strong real estate experience will be valuable to the Board.\n\nMr. Vaughan's appointment will fill the vacancy left following the retirement of Mr. Dale Klein on May 27, 2025 at the REIT's 2025 annual general meeting.\n\nThe REIT will be hosting its Q2 2025 conference call on Wednesday, August 13, 2025 at 10:00 a.m. ET. The dial-in numbers for the conference call are as follows:\n\nA replay will be available until August 20, 2025, by accessing:\n\nNorthwest provides investors with access to a portfolio of high-quality international healthcare real estate infrastructure comprised as at August 12, 2025, of interests in a diversified portfolio of 168 income-producing properties and 15.8 million square feet of gross leasable area located throughout major markets in North America, Australasia, Brazil and Europe. The REIT's portfolio of medical outpatient buildings, clinics, and hospitals is characterized by long-term indexed leases and stable occupancies. Northwest leverages its global workforce in eight countries to serve as a long-term real estate partner to leading healthcare operators.

  "summary": "Northwest Healthcare Properties Real Estate Investment Trust (NWH.UN), a global investor and operator of healthcare infrastructure assets in North America, Australasia, Brazil, and Europe, has suspended its distribution reinvestment plan and appointed Zachary Vaughan to the Board of Trustees. The REIT's strong operating performance in Q2 2025 was attributed to a stable, long-term lease maturity profile, a global portfolio occupancy rate of 97%. The company recorded fair value gains on investment properties of $13.6 million, compared to $172.4 million in Q 2 2024. Net income for Q 2 2025 was $32.6m, a decrease of 16.9% from Q2 2024, largely due to the decrease in mortgage and loan interest expense, positive fair value adjustment on investment property, and unrealized foreign exchange gains, partially offset by lower net operating income as a result of dispositions. Adjusted funds from operations was $0.10 per unit in QQ 2025 compared to Q1 2025 and Q2 2022, resulting in an AFFO payout ratio of 88% in Q Q2 2021.

The REIT's portfolio cap rate as at June 30, 2025 is 6.3%;\nThe REIT's leverage was 48.5% at the end of Q2 2025, as compared to 50.0% as at December 31, 2024, driven by proactive debt repayment from dispositions; and\nStrong operating performance in Q2 2025 was supported by a stable, long-term lease maturity profile with a weighted-average lease expiry (\"WALE\") of 13.5 years and a global portfolio occupancy rate of 97%.\nOperations and Leasing\nThe REIT's consolidated SPNOI increased by 2.8% in Q2 2025 compared to the prior year period, driven mainly by inflationary rent adjustments, rentalised capital spend, and improved recoveries reflecting steady growth in the REIT's underlying lease income. Regionally, SPNOI increased by 2.0% in North America, 4.6% in Brazil, 2.3% in Europe, and 2.6% in Australasia (see Exhibit 1).\nIn Q2 2025, the REIT completed 298,000 square feet of new, renewal and early leasing, achieving a strong renewal rate of 89%.\nAs previously disclosed, in March 2025, following sector margin pressures exacerbated by its capital structure, Healthscope Pty Ltd (\"HSO\"), the REIT's second largest tenant, occupying 12 properties and accounting for 6.1% of the REIT's proportionate revenues, requested temporary relief from its lender syndicate and landlords, including Northwest. In May 2025, HSO's parent entities entered receivership, with its lenders appointing McGrathNicol Restructuring to work with HSO management to complete an orderly sale of the business. All hospitals continue to operate as usual, and the company has received an additional A$100m facility to support operations.\nIn July 2025, (i) the HSO receiver repaid 50% of the previously announced rent deferral accrued to June 30, 2025, and (ii) Northwest agreed to an updated rent deferral arrangement with the HSO receiver starting July 1st whereby 10% of ongoing rent will be deferred. All deferrals are expected to be repaid by March 31, 2026 or upon completion of sale of material assets. The deferred rent has priority over senior debt.\nThe receiver-led sale process commenced in late July, and it is anticipated that a new owner will be confirmed in Q4 2025, with the transition process and timing of regulatory approvals to be determined. Northwest maintains constructive dialogue with the receiver and ongoing discussions with prospective operators participating in the process.\nAs of today, all rent owing to the REIT from HSO (other than the rent subject to rent deferral arrangements) has been paid and HSO continues to meet all lease obligations.\nDisposition Activity and Assets Held for Sale\nThe REIT's capital recycling during the quarter, including subsequent events, has generated over $231 million of proceeds as detailed below.\nDuring Q2 2025, the REIT sold its shares in Assura through two on-market transactions for total proceeds of $209.3 million (\u00a3114.7 million) resulting in a full divestment of the shares. The REIT's investment in Assura was acquired as partial consideration for the REIT's disposition of its UK portfolio in August 2024 at a value of $177 million (\u00a3100 million), resulting in a gain on disposition of approximately $32.3 million (\u00a314.6 million). Proceeds were used to repay related debt and corporate facilities.\nIn Q2 2025, the REIT completed the sale of one income producing property in North America, one development property in Europe, and one development property in Australasia, classified as assets held for sale at their fair value of $22.1 million. The proceeds were used to repay directly attributable debt and outstanding balances on credit facilities.\nAs at June 30, 2025, the REIT held one income producing property with a value of $34.3 million as classified as held for sale.\nFinancing Activity\nDuring the quarter, the REIT also extended or refinanced several debt facilities including Canadian mortgages and Australasian term loans.\nOn July 29, 2025, the REIT amended the terms of its revolving credit facility. The amendment extends the maturity date of the facility to July 2027 and moves the REIT to grid pricing based on its credit rating, reducing the REIT's cost of borrowing by 65 basis points. The amendment also provides a $100 million accordion commitment, subject to incremental security and lender approval, that provides the REIT flexibility with mortgage maturities as it transitions away from amortizing debt. Subsequent to quarter end, the REIT repaid Canadian mortgages totaling $40.8 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 2.67%, using capacity on its revolving credit facility.\nAs of today, the REIT has $20.9 million of Canadian mortgages with 2025 maturities that will be repaid with capacity from the revolving credit facility and $11.7 million of European mortgages that will be renewed in the ordinary course. Of the REIT's proportionate 2026 debt maturities totaling $424 million, over 50% or approximately $226 million are maturing in the fourth quarter of 2026, with the remainder relating to mortgages. The REIT currently has approximately $230 million of available liquidity, consisting of cash and the unused portion of its credit facilities.\nSelected Operating and Financial Information:\n| (unaudited) | June 30, 2025 | December 31, 2024 | ||||\n| as at | ||||||\n| Assets Under Management | $ | 8,220,857 | $ | 8,281,609 | ||\n| Number of properties | 168 | 172 | ||||\n| Gross leasable area (sf) | 15,750,688 | 15,886,309 | ||||\n| Occupancy | 96.6 % | 96.4 % | ||||\n| Weighted Average Lease Expiry (Years) | 13.5 | 13.6 | ||||\n| Debt | $ | 2,890,915 | $ | 3,027,154 | ||\n| Debt to Gross Book Value | 48.5 % | 50.0 % | ||||\n| Weighted average capitalization rate | 6.3 % | 6.2 % | ||||\n| Economic Weighted Average Interest Rate | 4.8 % | 5.5 % |\n| (unaudited) | Three months ended June 30, | Six months ended June 30, | ||||||||||\n| ($000's, except per unit amounts) | 2025 | 2024 | 2025 | 2024 | ||||||||\n| Net Operating Income | $ | 76,308 | $ | 93,976 | $ | 153,456 | $ | 189,428 | ||||\n| Net Income (Loss) attributable to unitholders | $ | 32,621 | $ | (127,224 | ) | $ | 17,091 | $ | (165,841 | ) | ||\n| Funds from Operations (\"FFO\") excluding accelerated amortization of deferred financing charges (1), (2), (3) | $ | 27,968 | $ | 22,314 | $ | 50,740 | $ | 49,271 | ||||\n| Adjusted Funds from Operations (\"AFFO\") (1) | $ | 25,407 | $ | 21,186 | $ | 49,755 | $ | 48,865 | ||||\n| FFO, excluding accelerated amortization of deferred financing charges, per unit - diluted (1), (2), (3) | $ | 0.11 | $ | 0.09 | $ | 0.22 | $ | 0.20 | ||||\n| AFFO per unit - diluted (1), (2) | $ | 0.10 | $ | 0.09 | $ | 0.20 | $ | 0.20 | ||||\n| Distributions per unit | $ | 0.09 | $ | 0.09 | $ | 0.18 | $ | 0.18 | ||||\n| AFFO Payout Ratio - diluted | 89 % | 105 % | 90 % | 90 % |\n(1) FFO and AFFO are not measures recognized under IFRS and do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS.

FFO and FFO per unit including accelerated amortization of deferred financing charges is $28.0 million or $0.11 per unit and $54.1 million or $0.22 per unit, respectively.\nDRIP Suspension\nThe REIT also announces today that it has suspended its DRIP until further notice. The REIT's unit price continues to trade at a meaningful discount to net asset value (\"NAV\") per unit, and the issuance of units under the DRIP runs counter to the REIT's focus of optimizing capital structure and driving superior growth in NAV per unit and returns over time.\nCommencing with the September 2025 distribution (payable on or about October 15, 2025), unitholders enrolled in the DRIP will receive distribution payments in cash. If the REIT elects to reinstate the DRIP in the future, unitholders that were enrolled in the DRIP at the time of its suspension and remain enrolled at the time of its reinstatement will automatically resume participation in the DRIP.\nAppointment of Zachary Vaughan to the Board of Trustees\nThe REIT is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. Zachary Vaughan, the REIT's current CEO, to the Board effective today, August 12, 2025, as a non-independent trustee. Mr. Vaughan's strong real estate experience will be valuable to the Board.\nMr. Vaughan's appointment will fill the vacancy left following the retirement of Mr. Dale Klein on May 27, 2025 at the REIT's 2025 annual general meeting.\nCorporate Presentation\nDownload the Company's Updated Corporate Presentation:\nhttps://www.nwhreit.com/investors/unitholders/presentations\nQ2 2025 Results Conference Call\nThe REIT will be hosting its Q2 2025 conference call on Wednesday, August 13, 2025 at 10:00 a.m. ET.

The REIT's method of calculating these measures and ratios may differ from the methods of other real estate investment trusts or other issuers, and accordingly may not be comparable. Further, the REIT's definitions of FFO and AFFO differ from the definitions recommended by REALPAC. These non-IFRS measures are more fully defined and discussed in the exhibits to this news release and in the REIT's Management's Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, in the \"Performance Measurement\" and \"Results from Operations\" sections. The MD&A is available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements with respect to the REIT, its operations, strategy, financial performance and condition. These statements generally can be identified by words such as \"may\", \"will\", \"expect\", \"estimate\", \"anticipate\", \"intends\", \"believe\", \"normalized\", \"contracted\", or \"continue\" or the negative thereof or similar variations.

The REIT's actual results and performance discussed herein could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are based on numerous assumptions which may prove incorrect, and which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Such assumptions include, but are not limited to (i) assumptions relating to the continued operation of HSO's hospitals and HSO's ability and willingness to pay its deferred rent in accordance with its agreements; (ii) the REIT's properties continuing to perform as they have recently, (iii) various general economic and market factors, including exchange rates remaining constant, local real estate conditions remaining strong, and interest rates remaining at current levels or decreasing, (iv) the availability of equity and debt financing to the REIT and the REIT's ability to refinance, or extend the maturity of, its existing debt, (v) the REIT's commitment to sustainability objectives and the impact thereof, (vi) savings resulting from the REIT's workforce reduction initiatives not being reallocated to other matters, and (vii) the impact that suspending the DRIP will have on the REIT's focus of optimizing capital structure and driving growth in NAV per unit and returns over time. Such forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations, including that the transactions contemplated herein are completed. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations include, among other things, general economic and market factors, competition, changes in government regulations, and the factors described under \"Risks and Uncertainties\" in the REIT's Annual Information Form and the risks and uncertainties set out in the MD&A which are available on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca.\nThese cautionary statements qualify all forward-looking statements attributable to the REIT and persons acting on its behalf.

The REIT calculates FFO based on certain adjustments to net income (loss) (computed in accordance with IFRS) as detailed below. FFO is more fully defined and discussed in the MD&A (see \"Performance Measurement\" and \"Funds From Operations\").\nFor the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, FFO was $26.5 million including accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs as a result of early repayment of the underlying debt, using proceeds from the senior unsecured debentures.
