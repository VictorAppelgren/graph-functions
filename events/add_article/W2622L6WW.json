      "summary": "Ford Motor Company, a long‑standing automaker, faces limited revenue growth, low profitability, and significant EV losses that threaten long‑term returns, and its stock has underperformed the S&P 500 over the past decade. While the company offers a high dividend yield and a low forward P/E that attracts income‑focused retail investors—especially on platforms like Robinhood—its cyclicality, tariff exposure, and uncertain EV transition reduce its appeal as a growth or millionaire‑maker stock. Consequently, Ford is seen more as a dividend income play than a vehicle for substantial capital appreciation.",
