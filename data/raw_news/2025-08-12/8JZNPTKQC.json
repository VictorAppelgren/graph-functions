  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None Mind Medicine stock is a speculative play on future potential for psychedelics as therapeutic treatments.\n\u2022 None The stock has underperformed the S&P 500 over the last five years, but it has still delivered positive returns for investors.\n\u2022 None Mind Medicine is a risky investment, but it's possible the stock could deliver big wins for patient shareholders.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Mind Medicine (MindMed) \u203a\n\nMind Medicine (NASDAQ: MNMD) is a clinical stage biotech company that's aiming to bring psychedelics and other compounds to market as forms of treatments for conditions including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The business is still in a pre-revenue state and has a highly uncertain forward performance trajectory, but it's recently garnered an uptick in interest from investors thanks to encouraging clinical trial developments and indications that political and regulatory developments could give the company an easier path to commercialization.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nOwing in large part to its highly speculative outlook, Mind Medicine stock has seen periods of huge volatility over the last five years. Despite jumping roughly 35% over the last year of trading, the company's share price is actually down roughly 86% from its valuation high in the period.\n\nHowever, Mind Medicine still delivered substantial returns over the last five years. While the stock underperformed the S&P 500 index's total return of roughly 91% over the stretch, it still posted an 87% return over the 12 months ended Aug. 8. If you had invested $1,000 in the stock five years ago and held on to your shares, the position would now be worth roughly $1,875.\n\nCan Mind Medicine beat the market over the next five years?\n\nMind Medicine stock is a very risky investment, but it does have avenues to significantly outperform the S&P 500 index over the next five years. The lead treatment in Mind Medicine's pipeline is a modified form of Lysergide D-tartrate, a form of LSD.\n\nWhile the idea of using psychedelics to treat anxiety and depressive disorders may seem unconventional, there is research that points to meaningful efficacy -- and Mind Medicine's early clinical results have supported continued research and trials. The company is set to release Phase III trial results for the treatment next year, and positive data could trigger the early stages of a strong run-up for the stock. Mind Medicine stock comes with a high risk profile, but shares could surge if the biotech specialist successfully brings a treatment to market.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Mind Medicine (MindMed) right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Mind Medicine (MindMed), consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Mind Medicine (MindMed) wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $653,427!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,119,863!*\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,060% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 182% for the S&P 500.

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

      "text": "Many investors focus their attention on how a stock's price changes over time. However, when talking about dividend-paying stocks, that doesn't even begin to tell the entire story.\nFor example, let's say JPMorgan Chase (JPM 0.2%) was trading for roughly $150 per share three years ago and is currently trading at around $240 per share. It may sound like investors who bought the stock made $90 per share over the three-year period.\nHowever, if I tell you Verizon (VZ 0.06%) also paid its shareholders about $14 per share in dividends over the past three years, that changes the story a little. Instead of the $90 capital gain per share, which translates to 60%, investors actually made significantly more when accounting for dividends paid.\nTotal return considers both capital gains and dividends for a complete picture of a stock's performance over a specified time. This can be extremely useful for evaluating investment returns among dividend stocks, comparing the performance of dividend stocks to those without dividends or other distributions, and comparing investment results when stocks are held for different lengths of time.\nWhat they are\nWhat are total returns?\nSimply put, an investment's total return is its overall return from all sources, such as capital gains, dividends, and other distributions to shareholders. As a basic example, a stock that paid a 5% dividend yield relative to its purchase price and increased in value by 5% over the first year you owned it would have produced a total return of 10% over the one-year period.\nTotal returns can be calculated as a dollar amount or as a percentage. In other words, you can say a stock's total return is $8 per share over a certain one-year period or that its total return was 11%. The best way to express total return depends on the context you're using it for, as we'll see throughout the rest of this discussion.\nTotal return can also be expressed on an overall basis or over specified time intervals. If you held a stock for several years, it might be useful to know its overall total return during your holding period.\nAlternatively, knowing your total return on an annualized basis could help you compare the results of that investment with those of others you own or with the stock market as a whole. In later sections, we'll discuss the actual calculation methods and provide some examples.\nWhy they matter\nWhy are total returns important?\nTotal return allows you to see the big picture when it comes to how well (or poorly) an investment is actually doing, not just how its share price is performing. Many stock investments, in particular, are designed to produce a combination of income and capital gains. Total return combines these two types of investment returns into a single metric.\nMany investors make the mistake of focusing only on how much their stocks move up and down, often ignoring other ways their investments have generated returns in their portfolio, particularly dividends. Similarly, many income-focused investors often judge their investments primarily on the dividends paid and don't pay enough attention to share-price movements.\nTotal return can be highly useful when you're assessing the performance of your investments and comparing their performance to each other or to the overall stock market.\nImportant terms\nImportant terms investors should know\nTo truly understand total returns and how to use them effectively, there are a few other investment terms and concepts you should know. Knowing these will also help you become a more well-rounded investor. Here are just a few.\nAnnualized return\nYour annualized return is an investment return expressed on a yearly basis. For instance, if you have one investment that produced a 20% total return in three years and another that produced a 35% total return in five years, it can be difficult at first glance to determine which was the better investment.\nWe'll get into the calculation of annualized total returns later. The point is that it can be a more apples-to-apples comparison to see investment returns expressed on an annualized (i.e., yearly) basis, especially if they were held for different periods.\nSimple returns\nThere are two ways to express investment returns over time: simple and compound. A simple return (or simple interest) is a rate of return based on the principal (i.e., the original investment amount) year after year.\nThis is often used in the context of fixed-income (bond) investments. For example, if a bond costs $1,000 and yields 5%, that is a form of simple return -- in other words, 5% of the original cost, or $50, will be paid to the bondholder every year until maturity.\nCompound returns\nA compound return (or compound interest) is a return that is paid on the principal and any accumulated returns that have already been paid. Annualized total return is a form of compound return.\nAs a simplified example to illustrate compound returns, consider an investment that generates a 10% annualized total return. If you invest $1,000, you can expect to have $1,100 by the end of the first year. For the second year, however, the 10% would be added to the $1,100, not the original $1,000. So, you'd end up with $1,210 at the end of the second year.\nCompounding frequency\nThe method most often used to calculate total returns is annual compounding. That's what the formula I will discuss in the next section will do.\nHowever, other compounding intervals are possible when computing returns and interest charges in finance. For example, your bank probably compounds your interest daily or monthly on your savings account. Other intervals, like quarterly, weekly, or semiannual compounding, are also possible.\nTo give you just an idea of how this works, a $1,000 investment that generates 10% total returns compounded semiannually would be worth $1,050 after six months. After another six months, a 5% (half of the annual return) gain would be added, which would make it $1,102.50.\nDividend reinvestment/DRIP\nTo maximize the total returns of a long-term investment, dividend reinvestment is an essential step. This means that when your stocks pay you dividends, you use those dividend payments to buy additional shares of the same stock.\nWith most brokers, you can enroll your stocks in a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) that will do this automatically and without any additional trading commissions. If you're a long-term investor, enrolling in a DRIP can help you maximize your total returns, and it can make more of a difference than you might think over long periods.\nInternal rate of return (IRR)\nInternal rate of return (IRR) is similar in concept to total return. However, it involves a more complicated calculation.\nAside from its complexity, the biggest difference between IRR and total return is that IRR is a forward-looking metric that incorporates things like projected dividends or distributions, future profitability, and more. This is more commonly used when talking about real estate investments, but it can also be applied to stocks when trying to project long-term returns from different prospective investments.\nExpected total return\nExpected total return is the same calculation as total return but using future assumptions instead of actual investment results. For example, if you predict that a stock trading for $30 will rise to $33 over the next year while paying $2 in dividends, your expected total return is $5 per share or 16.7%.\nObviously, nobody has a crystal ball that can predict stock performance, and an investment's past performance doesn't guarantee its future results. That said, projections can still be a valuable tool when analyzing opportunities, so using the information you have to calculate the expected total return can help you get an idea of the future potential of certain investment opportunities.\nRisk-adjusted return\nThis uses the risk-free rate of return and investment volatility to account for an investment's risk level when calculating returns. A basic investment goal is to maximize the amount of return produced by investments relative to the total risk. In other words, a lower return from a low-risk investment can be a better risk-adjusted return than a superior return produced by a higher-risk investment.\nOne popular way to assess risk-adjusted returns is with a metric called the Sharpe ratio. This not-too-complicated metric subtracts the risk-free rate of return from an investment's actual return and then divides it by the standard deviation (volatility) of that return.\nUnrealized versus realized capital gains\nAn unrealized capital gain refers to a stock or other investment that has increased in value since you bought it but that you still own. In other words, if you paid $5,000 for a stock investment that is now worth $6,000, you can't spend that $1,000 of profit until you sell. Once you sell an appreciated investment, it is then referred to as a realized capital gain. This is an important concept in the context of total returns.\nCalculation\nHow to calculate total return for a stock investment\nNow, we'll go through the process of calculating total returns. There are a few ways to calculate total return depending on the exact form of the metric you're looking for, but the good news is that none of them are particularly complex.\nTo determine an investment's overall total return, follow these steps:\n- First, determine how much capital gains it has produced since you bought it. For instance, if you paid $50 for a stock that's now trading for $60, your capital gain is $10 per share.\n- Second, you need to add up the dividends and other distributions the investment has paid over your entire holding period. Adding this figure to your capital gains will give you the investment's total return in dollars.\n- Third, to express total return as a percentage, which is generally more useful, simply take the dollar amount of total return you calculated, divide it by the price you paid for the investment, and multiply the result by 100.\n- Finally, to annualize the total return, you'll need a bit more complicated math. Take the percentage total return you found in the previous step (written as a decimal) and add 1. Then, raise this to the power of 1 divided by the number of years you held the investment. Finally, subtract 1. In mathematical form, this looks like:\nThis formula assumes annual compounding, which keeps the calculation as uncomplicated as possible. Other methods, such as continuous or monthly compounding, are also available, but this method is generally sufficient for calculating and comparing investment returns.\nExample\nA real-world example\nThat last part may sound a bit confusing, especially when calculating annualized total returns, so let's look at a step-by-step real-world example. Let's say you bought shares of Bank of America (BAC 0.33%) stock on Jan. 2, 2020, and sold them on Jan. 2, 2025. Now, you want to determine your total return on your investment. Before we start, here's the information you need to know:\n- You bought shares for $35.50.\n- Two years later, you sold those shares for $44.50.\n- Over the five-year holding period, Bank of America paid 20 quarterly dividends, which added up to $4.04.\nLet's review the three total return calculations I discussed in the last section. First, your overall total return. Your capital gain on each share was $44.50 minus $35.50, or $9.00 per share. Adding the $4.04 in dividends you received shows a total return of $13.04 per share on your investment.\nSecond, to convert this total return to a percentage, you need to divide the $13.04 total return by the purchase price for each share, or $35.50, and then multiply by 100. This gives you a total return of 36.7% over five years.\nFinally, to calculate your annualized total return, you need to use the formula from the last section. When you do, you'll get an annualized total return of about 6.5%.\nReinvested dividends\nTotal return with reinvested dividends\nNow, it's worth mentioning that if you're reinvesting your dividends as you go -- which I absolutely recommend long-term investors do -- the calculation gets a bit more complicated. Essentially, each reinvestment becomes its own return calculation, including the capital gains generated from the newly purchased shares.\nCalculating total returns with reinvested dividends is difficult using the previously discussed method. After all, you'll buy new shares at whatever price they're trading for as of the dividend payment date, and you'll end up with more shares than you started with, and then those shares will begin to pay you dividends as well. So, what's the solution?\nThe total return calculation with reinvested dividends can be simplified by looking at the investment on an overall value (as opposed to a per-share) basis. Consider our Bank of America example from the previous section. Let's say that you invested $10,000 in the stock and that after five years of reinvesting your dividends, your investment is now worth $14,160 -- a 41.6% total return (or 0.416 in decimal form).\nUsing our formula for annualized total return, we see that your total return with reinvested dividends is about 7.2% per year, which is significantly higher. So, by reinvesting your dividends, you achieved a slightly better total return than you would have by simply collecting the dividends paid by the stock.\nHow to use\nHow to use total return calculations in your investment strategy\nThere are a few practical uses for the concept of total return. As I've mentioned, total return is a good way to compare the performance of various investments over time. For example, let's say you own five stocks in your portfolio and have invested $1,000 in each one. Some don't pay dividends at all, and those that do pay varying amounts.\nAt first glance, it can be difficult to determine which of these stocks was the best performer over any multiyear period, especially if you don't automatically reinvest your dividends and just receive the payments in cash in your brokerage account. This is where total return comes in -- it can give you a single number that sums up the performance of each investment.\nFrom a strategy perspective, evaluating expected total returns from your investments can be useful when making decisions. As a personal example, I'm a big fan of real estate investment trusts (REITs), which are specifically designed to be total-return investments with a nice combination of income and capital gain.\nBy assessing one of these stocks' track records of total returns and determining whether the company's business composition has changed, I can compare total return potential when screening prospective investments.\nRelated investing topics\nThe bottom line on total return\nTotal return is a great metric to add to your investment knowledge. Some investments are designed to produce a great deal of capital appreciation, while others are intended to produce income. Total return combines these two types of investment performance into a single metric.\nKnowing how to calculate and apply total return can help you evaluate the overall performance of different stocks, compare different potential investments, and understand the value of dividend reinvestment, to name just a few things."
