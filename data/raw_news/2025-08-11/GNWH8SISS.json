  "title": "The state-sponsored killing of journalists is another way to limit freedom of speech",
  "description": "Editorial: The assassination by Israeli forces of an Al Jazeera correspondent and his colleagues is a chilling reminder that, when international news organisations are denied entry to a war zone, the responsibility for telling the world of the destruction and the human cost falls to local reporters alone",
  "content": "The life of journalist Anas al-Sharif is worth no more and no less than any other life lost during the war in Gaza, or in the terrorist atrocities, perpetrated by Hamas, that preceded it. But his targeted killing \u2013 alongside that of the four other Al Jazeera staff members who died with him \u2013 does raise further significant questions about the way in which Israel has conducted the war.\n\nThat an accredited journalist who worked for Al Jazeera (and previously for Reuters) was specifically targeted by the Israel Defense Forces is a development that can only be looked upon with a degree of horror. His death was not the kind of inevitable collateral damage that can take place in any war; for want of a better word, Sharif was the subject of a state-sponsored assassination.\n\nThe Israeli authorities say he was a terrorist, belonged to Hamas, and served as the leader of a cell. They\u2019ve produced some documentary evidence, but this has not impressed the independent observers who\u2019ve examined it, and it raises the question of why, if it was so compelling, it was not released sooner. It certainly does not give any lawful reason for his killing, still less that of his Al Jazeera colleagues \u2013 correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh, cameramen Moamen Aliwa and Ibrahim Zaher, and their assistant Mohammed Noufal \u2013 none of whom has been claimed by the Israelis to have had any links to Hamas.\n\nTruth, as the old cliche goes, is the first casualty of war, and the fact is that Israel \u2013 unusually \u2013 has banned international journalists from covering the conflict. The Israeli authorities say it is not safe to do so, a grim irony given Sharif\u2019s fate. That, though, is not a matter for them to judge: it is one that should be left to the many news organisations, including The Independent, that have proudly dispatched brave journalists into even more hazardous environments over the course of many decades.\n\nMoreover, the Israeli policy has meant that the actions of the Israel Defense Forces cannot be independently monitored and reported on in the traditional manner. The images captured during recent aid flights and first reported by The Independent, of a moonscape where once were bustling neighbourhoods and olive groves, have, alongside the reportage of Sharif and his colleagues, given the world some idea of the disproportionate way in which Israel has acted. The result is that Israel stands accused of war crimes by the International Criminal Court, and the term \u201cgenocide\u201d is increasingly being used in connection with the denial of food and medicines to the people of Gaza.\n\nAbsent the full measure of international scrutiny, journalists from Gaza itself have had to take on the responsibility of providing this essential function. They have willingly placed themselves in the line of fire to tell the world about the destruction of the Gaza Strip, and its human cost; to assess the extent of terrorist activity; and to draw attention to the plight of the hostages still cruelly held by Hamas.\n\nWearing \u201cPRESS\u201d flak jackets and helmets, they should have received the normal protections afforded to all journalists, and they might well have if they\u2019d been, say, American or Saudi. The vast majority of the 232 or so journalists who have died in the war in Gaza have been Palestinian \u2013 a statistic that almost speaks for itself. According to the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs\u2019 Costs of War project, more journalists have been killed in Gaza than in both world wars, the Vietnam war, the wars in Yugoslavia, and the United States\u2019 war in Afghanistan combined.\n\nAs the exiled Palestinian writer Ahmed Najad has written in this newspaper, the death of Sharif is an attack on truth itself \u2013 and such attacks on freedom of speech and thought are sadly not confined to war zones.\n\nThe arrest of hundreds of passive, peaceful protesters in London over the weekend shows how the effects of the war in Gaza, and the bitter arguments surrounding it, have spread across the world \u2013 or at least, to those parts where dissent is still possible and the press remains relatively uncontrolled by the state. It may well be the case, as ministers darkly hint, that Palestine Action is intent on carrying out activities that its supporters do not know about, but that still does not justify detaining elderly people whose only crime is to hold up a piece of cardboard with a message on it and exercise their right to free expression.\n\nA nation that seeks the support of its allies the world over will not succeed in drawing others to its cause by denying international reporters \u2013 and indeed, other countries\u2019 governments, and citizens \u2013 access to the truth. If Israel feels its actions are justified, then it must allow proper scrutiny of them, including coverage of the war it seems intent on perpetrating.\n\nThe killing of journalists will never elicit anything other than shock from the international community. Benjamin Netanyahu would do well to remember this.",

      "text": "Palestine Action ban \u2018could become Starmer\u2019s poll tax moment\u2019 as freedom of speech row deepens\nBaroness Chakrabarti said the proscription of the group risks exacerbating community tensions, and campaigners warned the ban was a threat to freedom of speech\nSir Keir Starmer is facing a furious backlash against the arrest of hundreds of people during a protest over Palestine Action on Saturday and has been warned he is making a mistake of \u201cpoll tax proportions\u201d.\nMPs from across the political divide warned of an excessive use of counterterrorism powers that was riding roughshod over the right to peaceful protest, after it emerged that many of those held were aged over 60.\nThe Metropolitan Police confirmed on Sunday that 532 arrests were made, 522 for displaying an item in support of a proscribed organisation at the march in central London over the weekend.\nCivil liberties groups including Amnesty and Liberty said the arrests were \u201cdisproportionate to the point of absurdity\u201d and that the government\u2019s terrorism laws were a threat to freedom of expression.\nLabour peer Shami Chakrabarti told The Independent the \u201cproscription of Palestine Action is in danger of becoming a mistake of poll tax proportions\u201d \u2013 a reference to Margaret Thatcher\u2019s unpopular policy that triggered civil disobedience and riots.\nShe added: \u201cThe notable presence of so many older people highlights the strength of genuine feeling. Criminal damage at air force bases can be prosecuted, but sweeping guilt by association only exacerbates community tensions and creates a bigger headache for the police.\u201d\nThe 532 protesters detained on Saturday is thought to be the highest number of arrests made by the Metropolitan Police in a single protest event since the poll tax riot of 31 March 1990.\nHome secretary Yvette Cooper defended the police but suggested those who were arrested may not \u201cknow the full nature of this organisation\u201d.\nHer comment led to calls for the authorities to be more \u201cclear cut\u201d about why they proscribed Palestine Action last month.\nThe group hit the headlines earlier this year when four members were accused of causing around \u00a37m worth of damage to aircraft at RAF Brize Norton.\nAfter the arrests, Downing Street defended the move to ban the group, saying it was \u201cviolent\u201d, had committed \u201csignificant injury\u201d as well as criminal damage, and that the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre had found the organisation had carried out three separate acts of terrorism.\nBut former Conservative cabinet minister Sir David Davis told The Independent the arrests were an \u201cexcessive use of counterterrorism law\u201d, adding \u201cthey\u2019ve gone over the top\u201d.\nHe said: \u201cWe\u2019ve not really been given any evidence for the reasoning behind proscribing Palestine Action. I mean, they broke in and painted an aircraft, they did not set bombs or anything. So that\u2019s the first question. What was the criteria? And then secondly, should you be arresting lots of people because they support a particular side and put up a banner?\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThe authorities should be more clear cut about why they have proscribed Palestine Action.\u201d\nMeanwhile, veteran backbencher Diane Abbott said the government is in danger of making itself look \u201cboth draconian and foolish\u201d.\nAnd former Labour cabinet minister Peter Hain described the mass arrests as \u201cmadness\u201d and said Palestine Action was not \u201cequivalent to real terrorist groups like al-Qaeda or Islamic State [which is] why I voted against its ban\u201d.\nMinisters insisted, however, that supporters would \u201cfeel the full force of the law\u201d.\nPolice had warned before Saturday\u2019s protest in Parliament Square, organised by Defend Our Juries, that they would detain anyone expressing support for Palestine Action.\nVictims minister Alex Davies-Jones said the right to peacefully protest was a \u201ccornerstone of our democracy, and of course, we respect that\u201d.\nBut she added that Palestine Action \u201cviolently carried out criminal damage to RAF aircraft [and] we have credible reports of them targeting Jewish-owned businesses here in the United Kingdom, and there are other reasons, which we can't disclose because of national security\u201d.\nShe said: \u201cBut they are a proscribed terrorist organisation and anyone showing support for that terrorist organisation will feel the full force of the law.\u201d\nFormer top prosecutor Nazir Afzal raised the alarm over the impact on court backlogs, telling The Independent prosecuting those arrested would be a \u201cterrific waste of time\u201d.\n\u201cThese would probably be jury trials as each of them would be advised to plead not guilty and expect a trial in 2027 at the earliest,\u201d he said. \u201cI also suspect that no jury would convict anyhow.\u201d\nAmnesty International chief executive Sacha Deshmukh said: \u201cPeaceful protest is a fundamental right. People are understandably outraged by the ongoing genocide being committed in Gaza and are entitled under international human rights law to express their horror.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWe have long criticised UK terrorism law for being excessively broad and vaguely worded and a threat to freedom of expression. These arrests demonstrate that our concerns were justified.\u201d\nSam Grant, director of external relations at Liberty, said: \u201cThe scenes we saw over the weekend of mass arrests at public protests are deeply concerning. That hundreds of people were arrested under these powers further highlights the dangerous breadth and vagueness of the UK\u2019s anti-terrorism laws. Conflating protest activity with terrorism rightly has the general public scratching their heads.\"\nMembership of, or support for, Palestine Action is a criminal offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison under the Terrorism Act 2000.\nSecuring a charge for an offence under the Terrorism Act will, in some instances, require approval by both the Crown Prosecution Service and attorney general Lord Hermer, police said.\nPalestine Action co-founder, Huda Ammori, said the Parliament Square demonstration would \u201cgo down in our country\u2019s history as a momentous act of collective defiance of an unprecedented attack on our fundamental freedoms\u201d.\nShe also criticised the policing methods used, claiming the fact most of those arrested at the protest were \u201cgiven street bail and allowed to go home\u201d proved the current ban was \u201cunenforceable\u201d.\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

      "text": "\u2018Not in our name\u2019: Fury grows in Israel over Netanyahu\u2019s defiant bid to \u2018finish the job\u2019 in Gaza\nAs Benjamin Netanyahu refuses to back down over military expansion into Gaza, hostages' families tell Bel Trew in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem why their government has got it wrong \u2013 and call for an end to suffering for Israelis and Palestinians\n\u201cIsraelis want peace. Israelis want to get out of Gaza. This is not in our name \u2013 we are not our government. Israel must be stopped.\u201d\nThese are the desperate pleas of Yotam Cohen, whose younger brother Nimrod, a then 19-year-old Israeli soldier serving mandatory service, was taken captive to Gaza by Hamas militants during their deadly 7 October attack on southern Israel nearly two years ago.\nThis weekend, Yotam joined tens of thousands of people who marched on Israel\u2019s military headquarters in Tel Aviv. Wielding portraits of their loved ones and banners, they urged world leaders to intervene. They protested against Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s controversial plan to expand the devastating 22-month bombardment of Gaza, a plan he defended on Sunday, vowing in a press conference to \u201cfinish the job... finish Hamas\u201d.\nAt the mass protest, some family members even called on soldiers to refuse to serve in the expanded fighting, and for the opposition to call a general strike. It follows waves of rallies across the country by Israelis calling on their government to return to the negotiating table.\n\u201cIsrael must be stopped. The Israeli government has to be stopped. Hamas must be pressured to achieve a deal. But the main problem right now is the Israeli government,\u201d Yotam says bluntly.\nThe decision to expand the war was pushed through the security cabinet last week, despite fierce resistance from Israel\u2019s chief of staff Eyal Zamir and numerous former security and intelligence officials.\nIt will see Israeli forces, that according to the United Nations effectively hold more than 85 per cent of the strip, push into the last corners of the tiny enclave, starting with Gaza City, with the intent of taking full \u201csecurity control\u201d.\nIt is a move many in Israel fear will not only embroil the Israeli military in a costly, protracted, and unwinnable conflict, but also serve as a \u201cdeath sentence\u201d for the 20 remaining hostages \u2013 like Nimrod \u2013 who are still believed to be alive. It could also crush the hopes of retrieving the bodies of around 30 more slain captives who remain in the hands of the militants.\nSome of the families told The Independent they are also deeply concerned about the humanitarian impact on Palestinian civilians, as the death toll from the bombardment surges past 61,000, according to local officials, and famine unfolds amid fighting and under an Israeli blockade.\n\u201cAs an Israeli... first of all, we are not our government. Israelis want peace. Israelis want to get out of Gaza. Israelis do not support what is happening right now in Gaza,\u201d Yotam says, with a quiet determination in his voice.\n\u201cIt is our government \u2013 our so-called elected officials \u2013 who right now in our name, with the power we gave them democratically, are using that power to commit atrocities: to kill Israeli soldiers, to kill Israeli hostages, to kill Palestinian civilians. This is not in our name.\u201d\nThe desperation was echoed by Shay Dickmann, who says her family suffered the deadly consequences of a ceasefire deal collapsing and Israel choosing military pressure over negotiations.\nIn November 2023, Shay\u2019s cousin Carmel Gat, 41 \u2013 an occupational therapist from Tel Aviv \u2013 was next on the list of hostages to be freed, but the truce collapsed the very day she was meant to be released.\nShe and five others were later shot dead by Hamas militants in a tunnel as Israeli forces advanced into Rafah in August 2024. The family say they believe she was alive just 48 hours before Israeli soldiers reached her.\n\u201cA year ago today, my cousin was still alive \u2013 I was hopeful and also frightened, just like the families you see here today,\u201d Shay says, through tears, at an earlier protest outside the home of Israel\u2019s defence minister, Yoav Gallant, in the centre of the country.\n\u201cTo the Israeli government, I [beg], make a deal now that brings back all 50 hostages. This is what the people of Israel want. This is what we wish for.\n\u201cAnd for the whole world: we need your help. We want the suffering to end. No one should be starving. No one should be suffering, no one should suffer from a terror organisation, neither the hostages, nor the Palestinians.\n\u201cAll we want is to live in peace and safety. We need the hostages to be back. We need this war to end.\u201d\nIsrael launched an unprecedented bombardment of Gaza in response to Hamas\u2019s deadly 2023 attacks on southern Israel, in which militants seized 251 hostages and killed over 1,000, according to Israeli estimates.\nSince then, Israel\u2019s bombardment, war with Hamas and blockade has killed tens of thousands, destroyed more than 90 per cent of homes and pushed the 25-mile-long enclave into starvation.\nSo far The Independent understands 148 hostages, eight of whom are dead, have been released in exchanges or other deals, while the Israeli military has retrieved 49 bodies. Only eight have been rescued alive by the security forces \u2013 which is why families fear military intervention is not effective.\nOf those 50 still in captivity, Israel believes 27 are dead and Mr Netanyahu has said there are \u201cdoubts\u201d about the fate of several more.\nIsrael\u2019s latest planned military escalation has already drawn national and global outrage: Sir Keir Starmer said hours after the announcement that it will \u201conly bring more bloodshed\u201d.\nThe UK joined dozens of countries \u2013 including Austria, Italy, Saudi Arabia, and ceasefire mediators Egypt and Qatar \u2013 in issuing separate statements against the decision.\nOn Sunday, UN ambassadors in New York debated the plans and several European countries warned that Israel \"risks violating international humanitarian law\" with the new offensive. UK representative ambassador James Kariuki urged both parties to \u201cstep away from the path of destruction\u201d.\nEven Germany, a staunch ally of Israel during the war, announced it will no longer authorise exports of military equipment to Israel that could be used in Gaza until further notice.\nWithin Israel, anger at the protracted conflict extends beyond those directly caught up in it, with growing resentment at the repeated reservist call-ups, the comparatively high death toll for Israeli soldiers, and concerns for the hostages. Polls show three-quarters of the country support an immediate end of the war with a release of all the hostages as part of the deal.\nThere are also growing concerns about Israel\u2019s global reputation amid a surge in condemnation over a famine unfolding in Gaza due to Israel\u2019s blockade \u2013 something Israel denies and blames on Hamas. Some family members of the hostages fear Israel is becoming a pariah state.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much international criticism about how Israel is acting, it feels like this government does not care about hearing that criticism,\u201d says Ruby Chen, whose son Itay \u2013 a soldier in a tank brigade \u2013 was killed by Hamas on 7 October, and whose body was taken into Gaza where he has remained.\nHe says Mr Netanyahu has \u201cmiscalculated\u201d, and \u201csuperseded the dismantling of Hamas over the return of the hostages\u201d, against the wishes of his people.\n\u201cI think that this humanitarian crisis in Gaza, both for the hostages and what is happening to the people in Gaza, has gone on long enough,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere needs to be an international intervention if the prime minister is miscalculating. And it\u2019s unfortunate that the US, as the mediator, is not putting both sides together and saying \u2018enough is enough\u2019. We feel like we are collateral damage.\u201d\nOn Sunday, Mr Netanyahu said he had a \u201cfairly short timetable\u201d in mind for the next steps in Gaza, but didn\u2019t give specifics and insisted his military takeover was the quickest way to end the war.\nAt the protests there were direct calls for Donald Trump \u2013 Israel\u2019s closest ally and largest provider of weapons \u2013 to step up and push through a deal.\nUS special envoy Steve Witkoff reportedly met Qatari prime minister Abdulrahman Al-Thani in Spain on Saturday to discuss ending the Gaza war and the release of all remaining hostages and captives, in an apparent bid to prevent Israel\u2019s planned expansion of its offensive.\nThere are reportedly frantic negotiations underway between the US, Qatar and Egypt to try to restart talks.\nBut many fear Mr Netanyahu\u2019s new proposal will undermine those efforts. And pressure is mounting in Israel, especially after the militant group released new, galling videos of two emaciated Israeli hostages in tunnels last week, prompting accusations from Israel that Hamas was deliberately starving its captives.\nIn one, Evyatar David \u2013 who was seized from the Nova Music Festival \u2013 was described by his family as a \u201cliving skeleton\u201d because he was so thin. He appears to be digging his own grave and speaks of going days without food.\nHis cousin Naama, 28, told The Independent the family \u201ccan\u2019t eat, we can\u2019t sleep, we can\u2019t breathe well, knowing what Evyatar is going through\u201d.\nStanding outside the Israeli defence minister\u2019s office, she says she was \u201ccrying for help\u201d and urged Israel to \u201cdefend your citizens. That\u2019s your first obligation as your leaders.

      "text": "The killing of Al Jazeera\u2019s Anas al-Sharif in Gaza is an attack on truth itself\nAnas al-Sharif grew up in the same war-scarred streets of Gaza as I did \u2013 and his frontline reporting while under Israeli bombardment helped connect me to my people in their darkest hour, says exiled writer Ahmed Najar. Now, his silencing feels like a crime against history\nThe news of Anas al-Sharif\u2019s killing hit me like a physical blow. A journalist with Al Jazeera, Anas was not my friend in the everyday sense \u2013 we never shared coffee, never walked the streets of Gaza together. But he was my neighbour.\nHe was born in the same place I was born: Jabalia refugee camp. His family\u2019s home stood in the same crowded lanes where I grew up, among the same walls scarred by decades of displacement and war.\nOver the past 674 days, I saw him every single day \u2013 not in person, but through my screen. When the rest of the world looked away, Anas was still there, reporting from the very heart of my city, from the streets where my family still lives. At a time when no one else dared to enter northern Gaza, he walked through the rubble, speaking into his camera, delivering not just the news, but fragments of home.\nWhen Israel plunged Gaza into darkness, cutting communications and severing people from the outside world, Anas\u2019s voice broke through like oxygen. Through his reports, I could see the neighbourhoods I knew, hear the voices I recognised, and feel the pulse of a place I am exiled from but can never leave in my heart.\nHe was more than a journalist \u2013 he was the thread that connected me to my people in their darkest hour. That made him a target.\nThe Israeli army threatened Anas several times. They warned him to stop reporting from the north. They told him his life was in danger. He knew exactly what they meant \u2013 in Gaza, such threats are never empty.\nYet he never stopped. He refused to be silenced. Instead, he doubled down, documenting every bombing, every destroyed home, every lifeless child carried from the ruins. He understood better than anyone that Israel does not just want to erase lives \u2013 it wants to erase the record of those lives. And it has made sure of that by banning international journalists from entering Gaza, leaving Palestinian reporters like Anas to bear the entire, deadly weight of telling the world what is happening.\nIsrael has even accused him of being Hamas \u2013 an accusation as absurd as it was predictable \u2013 despite the fact that Anas spent most of the past 23 months in front of the camera, reporting live, his location always known. I often knew exactly where he was, just by following his social media and Al Jazeera broadcasts.\nThe question is: why did Israel kill him now? Is it because what is coming to Gaza is even darker, with the latest announcement of invading Gaza City and displacing more than a million people?\nAnas even pleaded publicly with the international community to protect journalists in Gaza so they could continue to expose Israeli war crimes. He was not asking for special treatment. He was asking for the basic right to do his job without being killed for it. That plea, like so many others from Gaza, went unanswered.\nOn 10 August 2025, an Israeli airstrike hit a tent outside al-Shifa Hospital where Anas and his colleagues were covering the famine and starvation gripping Gaza. The strike killed Anas along with five other journalists \u2013 Mohammed Qreiqeh, Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal, Moamen Aliwa, and Mohammad al-Khaldi.\nIt was not just an attack on individuals; it was an attack on the truth itself.\nAnas\u2019s killing is part of a relentless pattern. Since the war began in October 2023, over 230 journalists have been killed in Gaza \u2013 the deadliest conflict for journalists in modern history. The vast majority were Palestinian reporters, camera operators, and media workers, many of whom were the sole remaining eyes and ears for the outside world.\nBut journalists are not the only ones targeted. Israel has also killed over 400 aid workers, including UN staff and Palestinian Red Crescent volunteers. It has bombed clearly marked ambulances and convoys. More than 700 doctors, nurses, and paramedics have been killed. Hospitals and clinics have been destroyed or rendered inoperative. These are not \u201ccollateral damage\u201d \u2013 these are deliberate strikes on the people and infrastructure meant to protect life.\nAnd still, no one has been held accountable. Not for Anas. Not for the executed medics in Rafah. Not for the aid workers buried in mass graves. The world issues statements of concern, but statements cannot stop bombs. Words without action are just noise \u2013 and in Gaza, the noise is already deafening.\nFor me, this loss is deeply personal. Anas and I shared the same streets growing up, the same camp, the same stubborn will to survive. I have lived in exile for years, but through his reporting, I could still feel close to Gaza. Every time he went live, I knew I was watching someone who was not just doing his job \u2013 he was carrying the burden of speaking for an entire people.\nHe filmed not as an outsider looking in, but as someone living the nightmare alongside those he reported on. He showed the world mothers digging through rubble for their children. Fathers carrying tiny bodies wrapped in white cloth. Children searching for food among the debris. And he showed it without flinching, without sanitising, without letting anyone look away.\nThat is why they killed him. And that is why we must remember him.\nIf there is any award, any honour, any recognition worth giving, it belongs to the Palestinian journalists of Gaza. They have risked \u2013 and given \u2013 their lives so the truth could survive. Their work has been done under constant bombardment, without protective gear, without safe corridors, and often while their own families were being killed.\nAnas al-Sharif will never report another story. But his courage remains. His words remain. And his example must remain a rallying cry \u2013 not just for press freedom, but for justice.\nBecause the killing of journalists is not just a crime against the press. It is a crime against history itself. It is an attempt to ensure that what happened in Gaza can one day be denied.\nWe cannot allow that to happen. For Anas. For every journalist, aid worker, and medic killed. For the people of Gaza still living \u2013 and dying \u2013 under siege.\nAhmed Najar is a Palestinian economist and commentator originally from Gaza, now based in London\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

He said his message was to \u201cstop the war of extermination on Gaza\u201d.\n\u201cProtect medical facilities, medical personnel, and journalists, allow medicine and food into Gaza, and open the crossings,\u201d he pleaded.\nThe Israeli military alleged on Sunday Al-Sharif \"posed as a journalist\", confirming it had targeted and killed him.\n\"Anas al-Sharif served as the head of a terrorist cell in the Hamas terrorist organisation and was responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF troops,\" the military said.\nThe CPJ had repeatedly sought the protection of Al-Sharif, noting that he had been \u201ca key source of news from Gaza for international audiences since the war began more than 650 days ago\u201d and warning that he was at risk of being killed by Israel.\nA UN expert previously warned that Al-Sharif's life was in danger due to his reporting from Gaza. Special rapporteur Irene Khan said last month Israel's claims against him were unsubstantiated.\nThe CPJ said Israel had failed to provide any evidence to back up its allegations against the slain journalist.\n\u201cIsrael\u2019s pattern of labelling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom,\u201d said Sara Qudah, the group\u2019s director for the Middle East and North Africa.\nMs Qudah warned two weeks ago that the danger to Al-Sharif\u2019s life was \u201cnow acute\u201d.\nReporters without Borders said Israel had killed more than 200 journalists in Gaza since October 2023, an unprecedented number. The Gaza government\u2019s media office said at least 237 journalists had been killed in the war while the CPJ put the number at at least 186.\nNearly 70 per cent of the journalists killed globally last year were slain by Israel, the CPJ said. In fact, Israel\u2019s killing of journalists in Gaza was primarily responsible for making 2024 the deadliest year on record for journalists.\nHamas said the latest killing of journalists could signal the start of an Israeli offensive. \"The assassination of journalists and the intimidation of those who remain paves the way for a major crime that the occupation is planning to commit in Gaza City,\" the Palestinian group said in a statement.\nThe Israeli military targeted and killed the Al Jazeera crew just hours after prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised, at a press conference in Jerusalem, to let some foreign media into Gaza.\nMr Netanyahu is facing internal and global uproar for his decision to push through a plan to widen Israel\u2019s devastating offensive in Gaza, with the aim of imposing full military control on the besieged territory.\nSome Israelis fear that the plan will endanger the lives of hostages, drag the military into a protracted, unwinnable war, and worsen the humanitarian catastrophe for Palestinian civilians.\nBut, on Sunday, Mr Netanyahu doubled down on the plan.\nIsrael launched a devastating ground and air assault on Gaza and a crippling blockade after around 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage during a Hamas raid in October 2023. Almost 50 hostages and captives remain in Gaza, although less than 30 are thought to still be alive.\nIsrael war has killed more than 61,000 people, destroyed over 90 per cent of the territory, displaced most of its 2.2 million people and caused a widespread famine, according to the Palestinian health ministry and international aid organisations\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

      "text": "\u2018Apocalyptic\u2019 pictures of Gaza\u2019s devastation echo the destruction of the Hiroshima bomb 80 years on\nPalestinians have been represented for the first time at a memorial for the bomb dropped on Japan, amid warnings the world has not learned the lessons from 80 years ago. Alex Croft reports\nAs shocking new images of Gaza\u2019s flattened landscape smothered in ash and dust emerge, the world is pausing to remember another conflict that produced widespread devastation: the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.\nOn 6 August 1945, \u2018Little Boy\u2019 was unleashed on the Japanese city by the United States, vaporizing tens of thousands of people in seconds and killing upwards of 140,000 over the months that followed. Japan surrendered soon after, ending World War II.\nOn the 80th anniversary of the blast, human rights organisations and Japanese activists from Hiroshima alike have voiced their fears about Gaza and that the lessons of the past have still not been learned.\n\u201cWhen images of Gaza are placed alongside those of Hiroshima 80 years ago, the parallels are striking,\u201d said Kristyan Benedict, the UK\u2019s crisis response manager for Amnesty International, told The Independent.\n\u201cLike Hiroshima, the devastation in Gaza is apocalyptic - entire families wiped out, children buried beneath rubble, and hospitals and schools reduced to dust.\u201d\nJuliette Touma, communications director for the UN\u2019s Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa told The Independent that one of her colleagues had recently been in Rafah, an area of southern Gaza which has been largely razed to the ground by Israeli bombardment.\n\u201cShe drove to get out of Gaza by Rafah in the south, and she said that Rafah looked like Hiroshima. I asked her if she had photos, and she said they were not allowed to take any. But then we both Googled photos from Hiroshima, and she said: \u2018That's exactly how [Rafah] looks like today\u2019.\u201d\nIsrael maintains that Hamas is responsible for both the war - that began after around 1,200 people were killed and around more 250 abducted by the terror group on 7 October 2023 - and the scale of the destruction in Gaza.\nWhen asked about the \u201clevelling\u201d of Gaza in a recent Sky News interview, a spokesman for the Israeli government said: \u201cWe regard any harm to civilians as a tragedy, while this terrorist organisation of Hamas, it is their strategy. They endanger innocent people and they use them as human shields. Israel, by contrast, makes every effort to prevent and minimise as much as possible harm to civilian population including evacuating civilians from combat areas.\u201d\nThousands of miles away in Hiroshima, fears about Gaza\u2019s future were shared at an event to mark the anniversary on Wednesday.\n\"No Nuke, Stop War\" and \"Free Gaza! No more genocide\" read some of the slogans held by hundreds of protestors who demonstrated outside the Peace Memorial Park, where prime minister Shigeru Ishiba attended an official ceremony.\nA Palestinian representative also joined the event for the first time. Around 55,000 people, including representatives from a record 120 countries and regions - including Russia and Belarus -were set to attend. The city held a minute of silence as a peace bell rang out at 8:15am, the same time a US B-29 dropped the bomb on the city.\nHiroshima\u2019s mayor Kazumi Matsui warned against a growing acceptance of using nuclear weapons for national security during Russia's war in Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East, with the United States and Russia possessing most of the world's nuclear warheads.\n\u201cThese developments flagrantly disregard the lessons the international community should have learned from the tragedies of history,\u201d he said. \u201cThey threaten to topple the peacebuilding frameworks so many have worked so hard to construct.\u201d\nIn June, Israel launched \u2018Operation Rising Lion\u2019 with attacks on Iran\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile facilities in a bid to scupper any attempt by Tehran to develop a weapon of mass destruction.\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly raised fears about what would happen if Iran had access to nuclear weapons and the devastation they would bring.\nSome Hiroshima survivors said on Wednesday they were disappointed by Donald Trump's recent remark justifying Washington's own attack on Iran in June by comparing it to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\u201cIt's ridiculous,\" said Kosei Mito, a 79-year-old former high school teacher who was exposed to radiation while he was still in his mother's womb. \u201cI don't think we can get rid of nuclear weapons as long as it was justified by the assailant.\u201d\nIn the Vatican, Pope Leo XIV said Wednesday he was praying for those who suffered physical, psychological and social effects from the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, adding that the event remains \u201ca universal warning against the devastation caused by wars and, in particular, by nuclear weapons.\u201d\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

      "text": "Arresting hundreds for protesting against a ban on Palestine Action shames us all\nThis is supposed to be a free country \u2013 but doling out criminal records to hundreds of pensioners should serve as a rebuke to the government, whose heavy-handed approach to this \u2018terror\u2019 organisation needs a rethink, says Sean O\u2019Grady\nSometimes, you see something and you know it just doesn\u2019t feel right. Watching the hundreds of Palestine Action protestors being arrested for doing nothing more than holding up a placard is, rightly, uncomfortable. About half of those arrested and carried off by unhappy-looking police officers at Saturday\u2019s event in Parliament Square \u2013 who have already been dubbed \u201cmarch martyrs\u201d \u2013 were over 60.\nOf course, people of that age can be dangerous in all sorts of ways, not least, to themselves, but they do not, by and large, make for ideal terrorists. Calling them such, and detaining them under Section 12 of the Terrorism Act 2000, feels absurd. It\u2019s just too heavy-handed and inappropriate.\nIf it happened in Russia, say, to some dissidents calling for a ceasefire in Ukraine, we\u2019d be hopping mad about it. Because it happens here, and the bobbies are doing it, and, to be fair, as gently as they could to some slightly frail individuals, there seems to be less of an outcry. Yet we\u2019re supposed to be the free nation.\nIn Trump\u2019s America, it could happen \u2013 but at least they\u2019d have a constitutional safeguard: the First Amendment, an inviolable law. The British have the 1998 Human Rights Act, and the European Convention on Human Rights, which the Tories and Reform UK would probably scrap.\nIt\u2019s frankly ridiculous, as well as pathetic and offensive, that Jonathon Porritt, the well-known environmental campaigner and former adviser to King Charles, is at risk of acquiring a criminal record because he supports Palestine Action. Or, rather, has the audacity to wave a piece of cardboard around stating such.\nHowever, perhaps the most extraordinary case is that of Alice Oswald. At 58, she\u2019s on the young side, but this former Oxford professor of poetry and winner of the TS Eliot Prize can be nobody\u2019s idea of an Islamist hate-preacher. Anything but.\nShe is, however, as you\u2019d expect, a perceptive observer: \u201cClearly, there were some police officers who were really struggling with what they had to do,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could see the slightly shifty look on their faces, too. When I was speaking to them in the police van, I did say: \u2018Write to Yvette Cooper and tell her that this is making your life impossible.\u2019\u201d\nI hope they do at least make their feelings known to their more senior officers. It does at least defeat the myth that we have two-tier policing \u2013 the police once again arresting people on the pro-Palestinian side and upholding the rule of law, even if it\u2019s not a particularly good law.\nOne defect in its present application is to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation with insufficient evidence for it. They certainly use force and violence against property, and have done some serious damage to RAF aircraft when they virtually strolled into a lightly fenced-off base in Oxfordshire. But is that \u201cterror\u201d?\nIt is not the same as blowing up a Tube train or a shopping centre, or equivalent to the atrocities committed by Hamas on 7 October 2023. Being a supporter of Palestine Action doesn\u2019t automatically make you a Hamas supporter.\nThere should be some special category of offence regarding groups who sabotage equipment essential to the defence of the realm, like the old law that made arson in a naval dockyard punishable by hanging.\nThe authorities mumble about Palestine Action having a dark side that can\u2019t be disclosed for security reasons, but that doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s convincing enough to justify putting a poetry professor in a cell.\nThe wider question is, of course, free speech, which for some reason seems to have become the preserve of the radical Right. In other words, if someone actually wants to wander around a city or go on a march with the message \u201cI Support Hamas\u201d, or an Isis flag, or some IRA banner, should they be at liberty to do so? Should they be allowed to write that online, in a newspaper, or say it out loud on radio or television? What about the terrorists\u2019 \u201cpolitical\u201d spokespeople?\nBack in the 1980s, we had a situation where Mrs Thatcher decided that the IRA should not be given the \u201coxygen of publicity\u201d, and so Gerry Adams could be seen but not heard on the Nine O\u2019Clock News after some murderous attack, with the reporter stating what he was saying (or, as if in parody, an actor voicing the words in a Gerry Adams Irish accent).\nI don\u2019t have an answer to this, except to resort to that notion of what feels right and wrong.\nA recruitment stall for Isis on a high street dishing out hateful antisemitic propaganda feels wrong, and dangerous. So, too, would an extreme right-wing \u201cpatriotic\u201d group dishing out ugly Islamophobic material, inciting hatred.\nWe have public order laws preventing such things. But taking someone off the street for holding up a copy of a quip from Private Eye can\u2019t be right.\nFor the record, it was this: \u201cUnacceptable Palestine Action: spraying military planes with paint. Acceptable Palestine Action: Shooting Palestinians queuing for food.\u201d\nThere. I\u2019ve said it, too. Should I now expect to be arrested? And if not, why not?

Even journalists are being targeted.\nHe says the Israeli army opens fire \u201cunder the pretext of combing the area or shooting to prevent people from gathering outside the buffer zone\u201d. The United Nations says more than 1,000 people have been killed trying to receive aid in the enclave in just a few months \u2013 most of them shot by Israeli forces operating nearby.\nEven if you can avoid that, the last time he went, he had to let three trucks go by before he was able to, in the suffocating scrum, grab a single bag of flour.\n\u201cMy joy was indescribable and I was overwhelmed,\u201d he says, with desperation in his voice. \u201cBut on the way home, three young men I\u2019d never seen before came up to me with large knives \u2013 and one man with a gun. They threatened me: either give them the bag of flour or they would kill me.\n\u201cI left the bag on the ground. I lost hope and fainted because of what had happened.\u201d\nThe situation is so dire, he says they call aid convoys \u201cdeath traps\u201d and the new Israeli security cabinet plans a \u201cdeadly game\u201d.\n\u201cThis is a game of chess controlled by the occupation, and we are the pawns it moves and controls, according to its mood, under the control of snipers and tanks.\u201d\nIsrael launched its unprecedented bombardment of Gaza in retaliation for Hamas\u2019s bloody 7 October 2023 attacks on southern Israel, during which they killed over 1,200 people and took more than 250 captive, according to Israeli estimates.\nSince then, Israel\u2019s bombardment has killed more than 61,000 people, according to local officials, destroyed more than 90 per cent of homes, and \u2013 through a devastating siege \u2013 sparked a hunger crisis.\nAccording to the United Nations, over 86 per cent of Gaza is already an Israeli-militarised zone, under displacement orders or where these orders overlap.\n\u201cThe data speaks for itself. Already early this year, over 90 per cent of Gaza\u2019s housing units were reportedly destroyed as per satellite images. Gaza has been reduced to a wasteland of rubble, with over 87 per cent of the territory declared a war zone \u2013 forcing people to concentrate in a tiny space,\u201d said Tamara Al-Rifai, spokesperson for the UN\u2019s Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA, the largest UN agency operating in Gaza.\nAfter a tense 10-hour Israeli cabinet meeting overnight on Friday, the Israeli security cabinet approved a new plan to intensify its 22-month war with Hamas by taking over Gaza City, issuing evacuation orders for the population to move south \u2013 with the aim of disarming Hamas and exerting full military control of the 25-mile enclave.\nThe controversial proposal, which has faced resistance even from within the Israeli security establishment, has ignited fears among Palestinian civilians and for Israeli hostages still held in Gaza and sparked renewed international pressure for an end to the conflict.\nAt the weekend, the UN Security Council held an emergency meeting on Israel\u2019s plans and issued a joint statement, condemning the move.\nIn Gaza City \u2013 the focus of the new offensive \u2013 Mahmoud Rayhan, 30, who says he had been displaced 20 times already, is \u201cpraying for a miracle\u201d, as his wife is pregnant and he fears the baby will be born in four months into famine and death.\n\u201cNow we are afraid that if we are displaced again, we will never return,\u201d he says in desperation. \u201cOur homes have been bombed. Life in Gaza has become non-existent. Even the necessities of life are non-existent. There is no clean water, no sanitation, no food, and no shelter. We live in an uninhabitable place.\u201d\nRafiq Abu-Jared, 54, who is also displaced inside Gaza City, says that when the Israeli military issues forced evacuation orders, he cannot leave as he has no money.\n\u201cIt costs over 1,500 shekels [\u00a3325] to travel south, and then you need tents, tarpaulins, which I don\u2019t have. And anyway, if a million of us stuck in the north are forced to flee south again, there will be nowhere for us to go.\u201d\nManel Odeh, 50, spent a year earlier in the war living in the already overcrowded so-called humanitarian zone of Al-Mawasi in Rafah, where Israel plans to corral most of the 2.3 million-strong population.\n\u201cEven the \u2018safe\u2019 zone isn\u2019t safe. I lived for nearly a year in the so-called safe zone there and it has been bombed hundreds of times and evacuated dozens of times. I have been displaced nine times in the south, and each time, I have paid more than $300. I\u2019m not moving again,\u201d she says.\nAnother concern is widening famine, which the UN-backed hunger monitor the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said is playing out across the strip. Israel denies there is a hunger crisis in Gaza but has eased restrictions on entry of supplies after massive global uproar and pressure, when images of emaciated babies dying of hunger were flooding out of Gaza, and the death toll soared.\nThe Israeli military has repeatedly said it is working \u201cto improve the humanitarian response in the Gaza Strip, alongside the international community, while refuting the false claims of deliberate starvation in Gaza\u201d.\nBut UN officials and aid organisations say not enough is getting in. The Palestinian health ministry said that in 24 hours alone, there were 11 further deaths from hunger and acute malnutrition, bringing the total number of deaths to 212, including 90 children.\nLast Friday, Dr Mohamed Abu Salmiya, the director of Al-Shifa Hospital, said at least six Palestinians were killed and 140 injured by Israeli gunfire trying to, like Nedal, get aid from the Zikim crossing. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.\nThere were also reports of another person crushed to death by a pallet of food landing from the sky over the weekend \u2013 as countries have been forced to resort to aid drops, despite the fact they are inefficient, at least 40 times more expensive than truck delivery, and can be deadly.\nThe Israeli military claimed over the weekend that more than 106 aid packages were dropped as part of operations by six different countries, including Greece and Italy, which participated in airdrops for the first time since the operation began.\nFor Nedal, air drops \u201care merely a painkiller used to calm us down\u201d, and that much of it doesn\u2019t get to the most needy, sometimes even landing in the sea.\n\u201cIt could land in the sea or on a tent, a house, or in a frontline zone,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no fixed location. Sometimes they fall in border areas or remote areas where young men go and then are bombed and killed.\u201d\nWith Israel greenlighting a renewed offensive and crushing hopes of a ceasefire, there is growing concern these numbers will only rise. Donald Trump, Israel\u2019s closest ally and largest supplier of weapons, has repeatedly called for a truce. His Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, was sent to meet the prime minister of Qatar \u2013 which has been hosting talks \u2013 in Spain to discuss the deal.\nMediators from Doha and Cairo are reportedly preparing a new framework that will include the release of all 50 remaining hostages \u2013 dead and alive \u2013 in one go, in return for an end to the war in Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Strip. But with Israel\u2019s new plans, there is little hope.\n\u201cWe are living in a deadly game,\u201d says Nedal with despair. \u201cA game we cannot control.\u201d\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

This privacy policy is for visitors to our websites, apps and other digital platforms. It sets out how we collect, use, disclose, and protect personal data that we hold about you. It also gives information on how to exercise your legal rights. In this policy \u2018we\u2019 and \u2018our\u2019 means Independent Digital News and Media Limited.\nThere are now two ways to read our content. Either you can choose to consent to us using your data to serve you targeted advertising, or alternatively we offer the choice to read our content ad free and without advertising tracking cookies enabled, by paying for a subscription.\nThe majority of The Independent\u2019s articles are free to read if you consent to us processing your personal data for advertising purposes. That means when you provide us with your personal data, you allow us to improve your experience of our products and services as well as helping to support our quality independent journalism.\nYou can withdraw your consent at any time by clicking on the \u2018Privacy Settings\u2019 in the footer of any page. If you do withdraw your consent, the cookie banner will appear again and you will be asked to choose how you would like to browse The Independent.\nPersonal information is any information that can identify you and can include:\n- Your name, email address, and year of birth, home address (if you\u2019ve asked us to send something to your home address).\n- Information about your device (your computer, mobile, tablet etc). For example your unique device ID, advertising ID, type of browser, and IP address. An IP address is a numerical code which identifies your device. It can provide information about the country, region or city where you are based.\n- How you browse our websites, such as the pages you visit and links you click on.\n- Details of products or services you buy, for example a subscription to The Independent.\n- Debit or credit card details if you buy a product or service (these are collected via a secure third party payment provider and are not held on our systems).\nWhen we refer to \u201cpersonal information\u201d in this policy, we are referencing \u201cpersonal data\u201d as defined under UK and EU data protection law, as well as \u201cpersonal information\u201d as it is defined under California law.\nWhat personal information do we collect about you?\nWe collect your personal information in one of the following ways, in line with the relevant data protection laws:\n- Information you give us e.g. when you register for an account, comment on an article, purchase a product or service or download one of our apps on your mobile device.\n- Information from your devices when you visit our website or app through the use of cookies and similar technologies e.g. device type and ID, advertising ID and IP address.\n- Information we generate about you e.g. we give you a unique ID to remember you when you\u2019re logged in.\n- Information we receive about you from other organisations, including social media logins.\nMore information about this is set out below.\nWhat do we use your personal information for?\n1) Personal information you provide directly to us.\nWhen you register for an account to read Premium articles.\nIf you want to receive a select number of Premium articles a week you will need to register for an account. We will ask for your first name, email address, password and year of birth. Readers under the age of 18 should not register for an account.\nWhen you comment on our website\nIf you plan to comment on our website, you will need to register for an account and provide us with a commenting name. When you comment publicly on an article on our site, we would recommend you don\u2019t share any sensitive personal information. We are not responsible for the information you choose to post online. Please see a link to our Community Guidelines on commenting here.\nWhen you take out a subscription or attend an event\nIf you are subscribing to one of our paid-for products, in addition to your name, email address, password and year of birth, you will also need to provide your billing address and payment card information. Your payment details are not held on our systems. Instead they are handled by a secure, trusted third party provider.\nWe may also collect this information if you attend one of our paid-for ticketed events.\nIf you attend one of our virtual events, we will share your full name, prefix and email address with the platform hosting the event. We may share your company name but only if you choose to provide this.\nWhen you contact Customer Services with a query\nIf you contact our Customer Services team by email, we receive your name, email address and details of your query. If you telephone us, we receive your telephone number and name. Please do not provide sensitive information unless you\u2019re happy for us to use it in response to your query.\nWhen you sign a petition\nWhen you click on a link to sign a petition relating to an Independent Campaign, you will be taken to a third party site. We are not responsible for the data you share with the third party, and we do not receive any of the information. Please check the third party\u2019s privacy policy for more information on how they use your data.\nYou may be given the opportunity to opt in for further communications about the petition you have signed, other petitions you may be interested in or to receive emails from us related to updates or events at The Independent. We will only process your information in this way where you have given us your permission.\nWhen you purchase products and services from third parties\nWe may also collect information about third party products and services which you purchase after visiting our website. For example, when you use a voucher code or click on a link to an affiliate site. However when you click on one of these affiliate links we don\u2019t receive any personal data about you, and we cannot link back the purchases to you specifically. Instead we receive aggregated, anonymous information such as which products have been bought by our readers and how many of them.\n2) Information from your devices\nCookies and other online identifiers\nWe collect data about our website\u2019s visitors using technology such as cookies, device IDs, IP addresses and general location or country. This may include your IP address, information about your browser or operating system and will include your email (only ever in secure \u2018hashed\u2019, pseudonymous form). If you would like to know more about our use of cookies and how to manage them, please read our Cookie Policy.\nIf you have purchased one of our subscriptions, this next section does not apply to you. If you accept the use of advertising cookies on our website, then when you use our website and enter your email address on our website (either to log in, or to sign up for a newsletter, or similar), we may share information that we collect from you with trusted partners. This may include your IP address, information about your browser or operating system or your email (only ever in secure \u2018hashed\u2019, pseudonymous form). Our partners use this information to create an online identification code to be able to recognise you on your devices. This code may be shared with advertising companies to enable interest-based and targeted advertising, that is more relevant to you. This code does not contain any of your directly identifiable personal data and will not be used to re-identify you. We and the below partners process your data to create this code as joint controllers under data protection law.\nDetailed information on our partners\u2019 data processing activities is available in their privacy policies by clicking below.\nTo opt-out of your data being used by LiveRamp in this way, please visit https://liveramp.com/opt_out/\nTo opt out of your data being used by The Trade Desk in this way, please visit https://www.transparentadvertising.eu/\nWhen you enter your email address to create an account or sign-up to a newsletter or marketing, we may also share your email address in a hashed form with Amazon Publisher Services (APS). APS then links this hashed email to a profile which they may already hold related to that email address. The hashed email will be used in a secure, pseudonymised form within a cookie to flag to APS whenever you visit The Independent site. APS will use this to determine, in real-time, if any of their business customers want to market to a profile similar to yours. If this is the case they may initiate an advert which will appear to you on The Independent website.\nThe APS Privacy Notice can be found here: https://aps.amazon.com/aps/privacy-policy/\nPlease see our Cookie Policy for more information.\nWe are signed up to the latest version of IAB Europe\u2019s Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) version 2.2 and comply with its specifications and policies. What this means is that we treat the personal information that we and our partners collect through cookies in a transparent and data privacy compliant way.\nMarket research, user testing panel and surveys\nFrom time to time we may ask you to participate in reader surveys, to help us improve our website and offering. Usually these will be anonymous, however if you choose to be contacted for future market research, we will ask for your name and contact information so we can get in touch with you. We will keep your personal data for only as long as we need it, after which we will delete it.\nWe use a third party survey provider for running our surveys, and we keep your data in the third party platform for three months to enable us to analyse your responses, after which we aggregate your responses and delete your personal data so it can no longer identify you.\nWe may ask you to attend face-to-face Zoom interviews with us or a partner that we have commissioned on our behalf. However, participation is voluntary and you are free to decline the invitations at any time. We may also send you links to short surveys and your responses to these surveys will be anonymous. If you agree to be a part of the panel, we will re-contact you after a year to ask if you wish to continue to be a part of the panel and give you a chance to opt out.\nWe may use the feedback you provide in our surveys or as part of our user testing panel, as quotes on our website, or in internal and external presentations in connection with the research study and our publications. However where we do this we will ensure that the quote is anonymous \u2013 unless you give us your permission to use your name, photograph or screenshots of you during any Zoom interviews.\n3) Information we generate about you.\nWhen you register for an Independent account, take out a subscription for The Independent or sign up for one of our newsletters, we assign you a unique ID number. We use your unique ID to recognise you when you are logged in. We also use it to ensure we remember your preferences such as which newsletter you have signed up to.\nFor readers who have not registered or subscribed, and are browsing our site anonymously, we assign you a unique ID number based on your device which remembers your browsing behaviour. This ID cannot identify you unless you then register or subscribe, after which we will link your anonymous browsing behaviour to your ID. This is so we can offer you a more personalised and engaging experience when you register or subscribe.\nWe also assign you a unique ID number which remembers your browsing behaviour. This includes how long you spend on an article, what types of articles you read (e.g. travel, politics, sports and so on) and how many, as well as how often you visit our website or app. This is so we can personalise the site and our communications to you, and where you have consented to this, we also deliver tailored advertising that is more relevant to your interests.\nWe provide each reader with a cookie ID for analytics purposes, so we can recognise when you come back on to our site using one of your devices such as your laptop or mobile phone. We do this so we know how many individuals come back to our site.\n4) Data we receive about you from other organisations.\nSometimes we obtain additional information about you from data management and consumer insight providers, such as Eyeota.\nThe data these companies may hold about you is collected from publicly available records, such as the electoral roll, or from other sources where you have agreed for your information to be shared with third parties.\nWe may then match you with the data that they hold in their database to find out demographic or household information about you. This ensures that the advertising you see is relevant if you consent to this.\nSocial media\nWe can also access limited information from social media activity such as when you \u2018like\u2019 the website, share content or follow us on Twitter or Facebook. When you sign in to our website using Google, we collect your name and email address. If you sign up for one of our newsletters on Facebook, we receive your email address so we can send you the newsletter you\u2019ve asked for. We may also receive demographic information from social media sites such as Facebook, including aggregated information on age and gender. However this cannot be linked back to you individually. This is used to tailor the advertising we show you if you\u2019ve agreed to receive personalised advertising.\nWe use personal data collected through our sites and apps only when we have a valid reason and the legal grounds to do so. The legal grounds may be one of the following:\nConsent.\nIf you have given us consent to send you specific newsletters, you can unsubscribe from these at any time. You can do this by clicking \u2018unsubscribe\u2019 at the bottom of each email (and additionally at the top of emails if you use Yahoo or Gmail), or by logging into your account and managing your email preferences.\nWe only conduct market research and send you surveys if you have consented to this.\nWe will send you push notifications from our apps, and/or send you browser notifications when you are visiting our app or website, only where you have consented.\nWe will only process your data for marketing purposes to inform you about our products, services or promotional offers that you might find interesting where you have consented to this.\nUnless you have purchased one of our subscriptions, you will be required to provide your consent to us processing your personal data for targeted advertising in order to access our content. The remaining paragraphs of this section apply to such non-subscribers.\nWe may tailor advertising you see on our website based on the type of articles you read, so it is more relevant to your interests. We do this by allocating your ID to relevant interest groups or segments based on your reading behaviour. For example, if you have read three articles about travel or commented on a travel article in the last 30 days, or if you have visited a travel website prior to coming onto our website we may place your ID into the travel segment, and you will subsequently be shown more travel-related advertising. If your reading behaviour is similar to that shown for our travel audience, we may include your ID in our \u2018lookalike\u2019 travel segment for some campaigns.\nWe will never use any sensitive data (also known as special category data) for this purpose. Please read our Cookie Policy for more information about this.\nWe may personalise advertising to you based on the information that you provide us when you register for an account. For example, we may aggregate your age (based on year of birth that you provide us when you register) into groups e.g. 24-35 year olds, if an advertiser would like to target their ad campaigns to this demographic. As well as using your online browsing behaviour and your demographic information to personalise the advertising you receive, we may also use this aggregated information for reporting and analytics purposes. For example, to see how well a particular ad campaign has performed.\nWe occasionally work with advertising partners to securely match the email addresses of our registered reader database with their customer databases, using our data matching service provider. This is so we can show ads to readers we and our partners have in common. All data is encrypted before it is matched, and neither party can directly identify an individual, nor see or access the other party\u2019s data. The data match service provider does not have access to any raw, unencrypted data.\nGenerally, this will be conducted at an aggregate audience level to provide insights, rather than individual level information, although your information may be used to generate these insights. These insights might include the overlap between our audiences and the client\u2019s, and other information that would be useful to understand for an advertising campaign to be effective.\nFor readers in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia, if you click the \u201cDo not share/sell my personal information\u201d button, which is in the website footer at the bottom of the home page, we will not recontact you about that choice for at least 12 months.\nLegitimate interests.\nLegitimate Interests are ways in which we use personal data that you would reasonably expect. These include:\n- Sending you service messages about your subscription or account registration, for example if you have clicked a password reset link. This could be by email, overlay on the website or push notification (if you\u2019ve consented to receiving app push or web browser notifications).\n- Granting you access to a subscription.\n- Dealing with any query or complaint you submit to our Customer Services team. Only provide sensitive data when relevant (such as information about your health, race or religion) if you are happy to consent to our using it to manage your enquiry.\n- Dealing with, and responding to you about queries in the comment section and other user generated content facilities.\n- Logging and using information about any service errors or interruptions that you have experienced in order to help us create fixes and to make technical improvements to our website.\n- Security and fraud prevention.\n- Verifying your identity and remembering you (for example when you return to the website and have already logged in).\n- Enabling you to share our content with others using social media or email.\n- Administering competitions and informing you if you have been successful in any competitions or promotions.\n- Keeping you updated about our products and services, in line with your communication preferences.\n- Monitoring the number of Premium articles you read as a registered user on The Independent website. This is so we can request users subscribe once they have read the maximum number of Premium articles over a given period of time.\n- Monitoring the number of articles you read on The Independent app. This is so that we can request users subscribe once they have read the maximum number of articles on the app.\n- Analysing what articles you have read so we can improve our content and make recommendations to you.\n- Improving the design and style of the website.\n- Responding to your feedback on our products, services and website and app functionality\n- Ensuring that we are paid the correct amount of commission by our advertising partners if you buy a product or service from our website.\n- Allowing us to measure advertising campaigns, ensure readers do not see the same advertisements too many times, and ensure advertisements are served in appropriate environments for our clients.\nPerformance of a contract.\nWhen you buy a subscription or another product or service from us, we will need to use your details in order to provide the item to you. For example, in order to deliver a product to your home, you will need to give us your name and address.\nCompliance with our legal obligations.\nIn some cases, we may have a legal or regulatory obligation to use or keep your personal data.\nHow can you access and update your personal information?\nIf you are a registered user or subscriber, you can update your personal information by signing in to your account page. In all other cases, please contact Customer Services.\nYou can also ask for a copy of the personal information we may hold about you, or for your data to be deleted via the above Customer Services form.\nIf you wish to contact us by telephone, our number is 0203 615 2990.\nHow long do we keep your personal information for?\nWe will keep your information only for as long as it is relevant and useful for the purpose for which it was originally collected.\nIf your account appears to have not been used for two years, we will try and contact you to check whether it is still in use and/or we will delete it. Please note that any comments associated with your account will also be deleted.\nIf you do not read the newsletters that you have subscribed to, we will suppress your name from the relevant list after six months.\nIf you purchase a subscription, we will retain your data for at least 12 months after your subscription ends in case there are any outstanding billing or other customer service issues.\nA record of a customer service query is retained for at least three years from the date it was submitted to us.\nWe retain cookie data and corresponding third party data for 13 months from when it was collected from your device. For more information about cookies, please read our Cookie Policy.\nWe may need to retain your data for a longer period if there is a legal claim or if we are required to so by any regulation. We may also retain your personal information to ensure we do not contact you if you have asked us not to.\nWe are fully committed to keeping your personal information safe and we take measures to protect your personal information from unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, as you will appreciate, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed as 100% secure.\nWho do we share your personal information with?\nSharing with the Group\u2019s companies\nWe may disclose your personal information to our sister companies: Independent Digital News and Media LLC and Evening Standard Limited.\nAdvertising partners\nIf you consent to the use of advertising cookies on our website, advertisers and advertising agencies sometimes require data to select and serve relevant advertisements to you based on your onsite behaviour e.g. whether you\u2019ve clicked on an ad and are re-targeted with another ad from the same advertiser. We may also provide them with audience demographics about an audience who viewed or interacted with a campaign.\nFor more information on what personal data we collect and how we use it, please refer to the sections above \u2018What personal information do we collect about you?\u2019 and \u2018What do we use your personal information for?\u2019.\nGovernment or regulatory bodies only if required by law\nWe reserve the right to disclose your personal information to comply with applicable laws and government or regulatory bodies\u2019 lawful requests for information.\nOur service providers\nYour personal details may be shared with third party organisations we have contracted to provide services to us which include processing data. For example, to send you the emails you have signed up for, to process your payment information when you buy a product or service, or for other purposes as described in this policy. Only companies who can provide adequate safeguards will be used to ensure your data is stored and handled securely. And we have contracts in place with these providers to make sure that they only use information in ways we have instructed them to, and to protect your data and comply with applicable law.\nTransfer as part of the sale of our business\nWe may transfer, sell or assign any of the information described in this Privacy Policy to third parties as a result of a sale, merger, consolidation, change of control, transfer of assets or reorganisation of our business.\nAgencies and authorities because of a legal requirement\nWe may also have to release information because of a legal requirement on us or pursuant to a court order.\nUsing children\u2019s personal information\nWe do not aim our services to children under the age of 13. We do not allow children under 18 to register an account with us.\nWill my data be sent overseas?\nAs you will know, the internet does not recognise national boundaries. Services on the web are accessible globally so collection and transmission of personal data is not always confined to one country.\nYou should be aware that by using the website and those of our partners or any website we link through to, your personal data may be processed in or transferred to other countries, the USA for example, and you agree to your personal data being transferred or processed in this way.\nYour personal data will only be stored or transferred within the UK, EEA, US or other countries using Standard Contractual Clauses, or other safeguards that have been approved by the relevant regulatory body.\nIf you are located in the UK or the EEA, you may contact us for a copy of the safeguards which we have put in place for the transfer of your personal data outside the UK or the EEA.\nHow we may contact you\nWe will contact you in accordance with your preferences. From time to time we may contact you by email or browser or app push notification to give you service information. For example, if your subscription is changing, or your payment method has expired. You will not be able to opt-out from receiving these service messages unless you no longer wish to use the services.\nIf we have your permission we may also send you newsletters or emails about our events, subscription benefits or new launches and website developments.\nYou can manage your preferences and subscriptions to newsletters and emails by signing into to your Independent account. You can also unsubscribe at any time by clicking the link in the footer of the email (or also at the top of emails if you use Yahoo or Gmail).

We do not usually charge for making a request, but we may charge a fee in accordance with the relevant laws in certain circumstances.\nPlease note the Independent is a media organisation and publisher. This means we may be subject to certain exemptions under data protection law when we process personal data for the purposes of journalism.

      "text": "Two Israeli rights groups say their country is committing genocide in Gaza\nTwo prominent Israeli rights groups say their country is committing genocide in Gaza\nTwo prominent Israeli rights groups on Monday, July 28 2025 said their country is committing genocide in Gaza. This marks the first time that local Jewish-led organizations have made such accusations against Israel during nearly 22 months of war.\nThe claims by B\u2019Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights-Israel add to an explosive debate over whether Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza \u2014 launched in response to Hamas\u2019 deadly October 7 2023, attack \u2014 amounts to genocide.\nThe Palestinians, their supporters and international human rights groups make that claim, and the International Court of Justice is currently hearing a genocide case filed by South Africa against Israel.\nBut in Israel itself, founded in the wake of the Holocaust, even the government\u2019s strongest critics have largely refrained from making these accusations.\nThat\u2019s because of the deep sensitivities and strong memories of the Nazi genocide of Europe\u2019s Jews.\nMany in Israel also view the war in Gaza as a justified response to the deadliest attack in the country\u2019s history and not an attempt at extermination.\nThe rights groups, while prominent and respected internationally, are considered in Israel to be on the political fringe, and their views are not representative of the vast majority of Israelis. Having the allegation of genocide come from Israeli voices does shatter a taboo in a society that has been reticent to criticize Israel's conduct in Gaza.\nGuy Shalev, director of Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, said the Jewish-Israeli public often dismisses accusations of genocide as antisemitic or biased against Israel.\n\u201cPerhaps human rights groups based in Israel, and coming to this conclusion, is a way to confront that accusation and get people to acknowledge the reality,\u201d he said.\nIsrael asserts that it is fighting an existential war and abides by international law. It has constantly rejected genocide allegations as antisemitic.\nIt is challenging such allegations at the International Court of Justice, and it has rejected the International Criminal Court\u2019s allegations that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant have committed war crimes in Gaza. Both face international arrest warrants.\nIsrael\u2019s government on Monday didn't immediately comment on the reports by B\u2019Tselem and PHRI. Israeli officials largely blame civilian deaths in Gaza on Hamas, saying it uses civilians as shields by embedding militants in residential areas.\nThe rights groups, in separate reports released jointly, said Israel\u2019s policies in Gaza, statements by senior officials about its goals there and the systematic dismantling of the territory\u2019s health system contributed to their conclusion of genocide.\nTheir claims echoed those of previous reports from international rights groups like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International.\nLike other rights groups, B\u2019Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights-Israel have not been allowed into Gaza while the war has been ongoing. Their reports are based on testimonies, documents, eyewitnesses and consultations with legal experts.\nHamas\u2019 attack on Israel that started the war sparked a shift in the country\u2019s policy toward Palestinians in Gaza from \u201crepression and control to destruction and annihilation,\u201d B\u2019Tselem said.\nThe group has long been outspoken about Israel's treatment of Palestinians. It halted cooperation with the military nearly a decade ago, saying the army's investigations into wrongdoing weren't serious, and it has accused Israel of being an apartheid state.\nThe PHRI report was a detailed, legal-medical analysis focusing on what it called the step-by-step dismantling of Gaza\u2019s health and life-sustaining systems including electricity, clean water and access to food.\nIts report says Israel has committed three of the acts of genocide defined by international law, including \u201cdeliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\u201d\nThe Israeli rights groups said repeated statements by Israeli officials and the military endorsing the total destruction, starvation and permanent displacement of Palestinians in Gaza, combined with policies on the ground, have demonstrated that Israel is intentionally trying to destroy Palestinian society.\nThe term \u201cgenocide\u201d strikes a chord in Israel, where Israelis grow up learning about the Holocaust and hearing survivors\u2019 harrowing stories, while promising it would never happen again.\nThe 1948 Convention of the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide was drawn up in the aftermath of World War II and the murder by Nazi Germany of 6 million Jews. It defines genocide as acts \u201ccommitted with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group.\u201d\n\u201cAs the grandson of a Holocaust survivor, it\u2019s very painful for me to be reaching this conclusion,\u201d said Shalev from PHRI. But after growing up in a society where the Holocaust was so important, it demands some kind of responsibility, he said.\nUntil now, Israeli criticism of the war in Gaza has been focused on Netanyahu and whether his wartime decision-making has been politically motivated and delayed the return of hostages \u2014 50 of them still in Gaza.\nBroader scrutiny of Israel\u2019s conduct in Gaza has been limited for multiple reasons. Despite the vast destruction and death in the territory and Israel's growing international isolation, most Israelis have believed for much of the war in its righteousness.\nAnd with most Jewish Israelis serving in the army, it\u2019s difficult for most people to fathom that their relatives in uniform could be carrying out genocide. Some soldiers, however, have refused to fight in the war.\nJeffrey Herf, a historian who has published much on antisemitism, said the allegation of genocide doesn\u2019t take into account that there is a war between two parties. He said it ignores Hamas as a military force and Israel's right to defend itself.\nAfter groups like B'Tselem in recent years accused Israel of apartheid, more mainstream voices in Israel also picked up the claim, although in less sweeping ways.\nIsraeli historian Tom Segev said he's not sure the new reports and their allegations will have an impact on the public.\n\u201cThe major thing for Israelis is a question of the hostages, not necessarily the fate of the population in Gaza,\u201d he said. But he said what's happening in Gaza is undermining the ideological and moral justification for the existence of Israel.\nThe rights groups said the international community hasn\u2019t done enough to protect Palestinians and are calling on the world, including Israelis who have stayed silent, to speak up.\n\u201cWe have an obligation to do everything we can to speak the truth about this, to stand by the victims,\u201d said Sarit Michaeli, the international director for B\u2019Tselem."

      "text": "Inside Israel\u2019s plan to seize full military control of Gaza\nBenjamin Netanyahu\u2019s plan was pushed through early Friday morning after a tense 10-hour marathon tense meeting, where the Israeli PM faced fierce resistance from his own chief of staff Eyal Zamir\nIsrael\u2019s security cabinet has approved plans to take full military control of Gaza and to force the entire 2.3 million-strong population south, starting with an initial offensive and siege on its largest city, which they will empty by the symbolic anniversary of 7 October, according to sources and reports briefed on the discussions.\nThe plan was pushed through early Friday after a tense 10-hour marathon meeting, where Benjamin Netanyahu faced fierce resistance from his own chief of staff, Eyal Zamir, a source briefed on the meeting told The Independent.\nHe said it would put the hostages\u2019 lives at risk, damage international legitimacy, and deplete reserve soldiers. There are also concerns there are no guarantees of \u201ctotal victory\u201d and instead it will embroil Israel indefinitely in Gaza, impacting Israel\u2019s global standing and making it even more of a pariah state.\nThe proposal has already faced local and global outrage: Keir Starmer said hours after the announcement it will \u201conly bring more bloodshed\u201d, and the UN Human Rights Chief, Volker T\u00fcrk, said it will lead to \u201cmore massive forced displacement, more killing, more unbearable suffering, senseless destruction and atrocity crimes\u201d.\nCivilians in Gaza described how they need \u201ca miracle to save us\u201d, and the families of the Israeli hostages held by Hamas, some of whom chained themselves to gates outside the cabinet meeting in Jerusalem on Thursday night, called it \u201ca colossal catastrophe for both the hostages and our soldiers\u201d.\nBenjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said publicly the main five goals are: Israel\u2019s security control of the entire Strip, disarming Hamas, returning the hostages, demilitarisation of Gaza, and \u201cthe establishment of an alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority\u201d.\nIn practice, sources briefed on the discussion said the Israeli military plan to begin \u201cgradually\u201d at first \u2013 ordering the population of Gaza City to move and corral south of the tiny 25-mile enclave, which The Independent saw from the sky is already overwhelmed by hundreds of thousands of displaced families living in makeshift shelters.\nThe focus of the initial military offensive will be carried out by the symbolic date of 7 October 2025, after which a siege will be imposed on Gaza City and army forces \u201cwill manoeuvre in it,\u201d according to Kan, Israel\u2019s public broadcaster.\nDuring the talks, despite backlash from Israeli military chief Zamir, who proposed a watered-down version of partial military occupation, some ministers at the meeting claimed they would not settle for anything less than the full military occupation of the entire Strip.\nThere were some who also expressed anger at the increase of humanitarian aid to Gaza.\nThe same source told The Independent that the United States, the biggest ally and supplier of weapons, had been informed on some details beforehand.\nAccording to the United Nations, over 86 percent of Gaza is already an Israeli-militarised zone, under displacement orders or in areas where these overlap \u2013 this new plan would see the army push into the final scraps left of the destroyed enclave.\nIt will also see the forced evacuation and mass displacement of approximately a million civilians believed to be sheltering in the north, including in Gaza City, to the already overcrowded south. Prominent rights groups including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have said the forced displacement of Palestinian civilians constitutes a crime against humanity.\nAmnesty has also warned that the Israel\u2019s blockade and use of starvation as a \u201cweapon of war\u201d is a part of an ongoing genocide, something Israel has repeatedly and vehemently denied.\nIn Gaza City, which will be the focus of the attack, families already displaced five or six times said they were praying for a miracle as they cannot survive another renewed offensive or forced evacuation order.\n\u201cWe feel like we're dead. Displacement is another death for me. It's literally death,\u201d said Hanaa al-Ghoul, 40, in tears. \u201cI have no intention of moving south. Repeating the life of displacement in the south means feeling death every day. I can\u2019t do it,\u201d she added.\nThe plan has faced mass backlash from the families of the hostages and captives still held in Gaza, who said the decision was leading towards \u201ca colossal catastrophe\u201d for their relatives and the soldiers . There are around 50 hostages left in Gaza, only 20 are believed to still be alive, although there are fears that the true number is much less.\nThey said that by choosing military escalation over negotiation, the government had left their loved ones at the mercy of the militant group Hamas who killed over 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostage on 7 October, according to Israeli estimates. It \u201cmeans abandoning the hostages, while completely ignoring the repeated warnings from military leadership and the clear will of the majority of the Israeli public\u201d.\n\u201cOur government is leading us toward a colossal catastrophe for both the hostages and our soldiers. The cabinet chose last night to embark on another march of recklessness, on the backs of the hostages, the soldiers, and Israeli society as a whole,\u201d they added.\nIsraeli official sources said last week there was already pushback from among the reservists, \u201cexhausted by the long call-ups.\u201d\nEarlier, Netanyahu had said in an interview with Fox News that Israel plans to take control of all of Gaza, but did not want to \u201ckeep\u201d the besieged Strip long term, without specifying.\n\u201cWe want to have a security perimeter. We don\u2019t want to govern it. We don\u2019t want to be there as a governing body,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to hand it over to Arab forces that will govern it properly,\u201d he added, without giving further details.\nThe Security cabinet later ruled it not would permit the Hamas militant group nor the Palestinian Authority - which is recognised globally and governs the occupied West Bank - to run Gaza.\nThey gave no clarity on who Israel would permit to run what is left of destroyed strip.\nThe office of the Palestinian presidency said that the displacement of one million Palestinians to the south \u201crepresents a continuation of the policy of genocide, systematic killing, starvation, and siege, and a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law and international legitimacy resolutions.\u201d\nThey said they would immediately address the UN Security Council \u201cto request urgent and binding action to halt these crimes\u201d and urged the international community to intervene.\nThe Palestinian deputy foreign minister, Omar Awadallah, urged the international community to urgently act: \u201cTo the international community, are we going to accept apartheid colonialism in the 21st century? \u2026 Words are not enough.

  "argos_summary": "The targeted killing of journalist Anas al-Sharif and four other Al Jazeera staff members by Israeli forces raises serious concerns about Israel's conduct in the ongoing Gaza conflict, with accusations of state-sponsored assassination rather than collateral damage. Israeli authorities claim al-Sharif was linked to Hamas, but independent observers question the validity of this evidence. The situation is compounded by a ban on international journalists in Gaza, limiting independent reporting and scrutiny of military actions, leading to accusations of war crimes and genocide against Israel. Amidst this, protests in London against the proscription of Palestine Action highlight the global implications of the conflict and the tensions surrounding freedom of speech.",
