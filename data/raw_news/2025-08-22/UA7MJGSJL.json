  "content": "A postman has been hailed a hero for performing an extraordinary act perhaps only fully appreciated by people who dry their bed sheets outside in the sun.\n\nGurpreet Singh was caught on a homeowner\u2019s security camera making a delivery to a suburban address in Logan, south of Brisbane, Australia last Thursday.\n\nInstead of throwing the package towards the door, as some less professional delivery drivers might be tempted to do, Singh is seen taking the resident\u2019s sheets off the clothesline and putting them under cover.\n\nHomeowner Verrity Wandel was so astonished she posted the video to social media this week with the words: \u201cThis is 1 in a million. I thought I was coming home to find my wash soaking wet but NO.\u201d\n\nOn social media, where complaints about dodgy deliveries are a more common occurrence, Singh\u2019s thoughtful act went viral. The story was picked up by media in India, where one outlet dubbed Singh a \u201claundry hero.\u201d\n\nAs their online fame spread, Singh and Wandel appeared on breakfast television in Australia, where Wandel walked viewers through the events of the day.\n\n\u201cI just had visions of my washing being wrapped round and round the line, or embedded in the garden, and I drove in and there was no washing on the line. And I thought, that\u2019s odd,\u201d she told CNN affiliate 9 News.\n\nAsked why he did it, Singh, who seemed genuinely bewildered by the attention, said he wondered \u201cwhether I can do it or not\u201d then did it anyway. It took \u201cone minute,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a member of Brisbane\u2019s Sikh community, Singh\u2019s a familiar face at the local temple and he\u2019s known to perform acts of service in line with his Sikh faith, one community member told CNN.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw this act, I knew that he wasn\u2019t doing it for any publicity or anything, that\u2019s just who he is,\u201d said Tejinder Singh.\n\nWandel denied suggestions made by one radio host that she was part of an elaborate marketing ploy on behalf of government-owned Australia Post.\n\nRun as a commercial operation, Australia Post has struggled with losses in recent years, amid a decline in letter-sending and competition from delivery companies.\n\nOf Singh, Australia Post said it\u2019d been inundated by requests for information about the delivery driver, who\u2019d worked as a contractor for four years. \u201cHe tries to help customers out where he can,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nWhile Wandel\u2019s original post attracted thousands of comments in praise of Singh, a series of abusive comments prompted her to post a follow-up video.\n\n\u201cWe should be a kinder world,\u201d she said in the video.\n\n\u201cIf you have the opportunity to do a totally selfless act, do it, don\u2019t think about it. Say hello to somebody. Smile at somebody. It makes a difference.\u201d",
