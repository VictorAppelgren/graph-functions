  "title": "49ers WR injuries keep adding up: Jordan Watkins out with high-ankle sprain",
  "description": "The 49ers' tricky position: They'll likely be without three top wideouts to start the season, but none is projected to be out long-term.",
  "content": "SANTA CLARA, Calif. \u2014 The San Francisco 49ers\u2019 already-thin wide receiver corps grew more precarious this week when the team learned good-looking rookie Jordan Watkins suffered a high-ankle sprain Saturday and would miss about a month.\n\nThe 49ers had been counting on Watkins, a fourth-round pick who led the team with 56 receiving yards against the Denver Broncos, to have a significant role in the Sept. 7 opener in Seattle. Now he joins a long list of high-profile wideouts who are iffy or out to start the season.\n\nOn Monday, for example, coach Kyle Shanahan gave a rough estimate for Brandon Aiyuk\u2019s return: Week 6. He said Aiyuk and the team\u2019s other players recovering from torn ACLs, safety Malik Mustapha and quarterback Kurtis Rourke, might be back around then, though he cautioned there was a range of dates for their actual return to the field.\n\n\u201cThat could be Week 10, it could be Week 5, but that\u2019s the area where I start thinking about it, which is a long ways away,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cI know it\u2019s not Week 1 or anything like that, so it\u2019s something I\u2019m not really thinking about too much.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, receiver Demarcus Robinson is appealing a league suspension related to his November DUI incident in Southern California. Similar arrests have resulted in three-game suspensions to begin the season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how it\u2019s going,\u201d Shanahan said of the appeal. \u201cWe always just plan for the worst and hope for the best. But he\u2019s done a good job here. We\u2019ve really enjoyed him as a guy. Knowing he won\u2019t be in there most likely for those first few games, he\u2019ll play a lot more in the preseason.\u201d\n\nFinally, Jauan Jennings was seen doing light running on a side field Monday as he deals with a calf issue that bothered him in the spring and reappeared early in training camp. Jennings is also unhappy with his contract, though Shanahan said recently that the calf and contract aren\u2019t related.\n\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d he said Saturday. \u201cAnd this is actually why Jauan missed OTAs \u2014 because of his calf. It\u2019s the same injury he had last year during training camp. We didn\u2019t get him until the end of training camp last year, and it\u2019s the same thing on the MRI, and it\u2019s the same thing he\u2019s going through. But hopefully we\u2019ll get him back sooner than later.\u201d\n\nSome positive news at the position: Jacob Cowing, who suffered a hamstring strain on the first day of training camp, tested well in a Sunday workout and should be back in practice Tuesday. If that goes well, he\u2019ll take part in the joint practice with the Las Vegas Raiders on Thursday and the preseason game there Saturday.\n\nThe joint practice remains on the schedule, though it might not be as comprehensive as last week\u2019s session with the Broncos. For example, the 49ers were so short on receivers Monday that they eliminated one-on-one drills from their practice routine and had a decidedly shorter-than-usual practice.\n\n\u201cHopefully we won\u2019t have to cut too many things (out of practice) for Vegas,\u201d Shanahan said.\n\nShanahan said the team was looking into all options at receiver, though he acknowledged the timing was tricky. If Watkins, Aiyuk and Robinson were going to miss bigger chunks of the season, for example, the 49ers might be aggressive in signing a high-profile free agent. The list of players available includes Gabe Davis and Amari Cooper, whose name was linked to the 49ers a year ago when the team was considering trading Aiyuk to the Cleveland Browns.\n\nShanahan, however, said the team had to weigh salary-cap expenses against plugging a mid-August roster hole.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking into everything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll always try to do the best. But we\u2019re also trying not to just panic and do something to survive a tough situation at the expense of (something that) would really hurt us later this year and next year.\u201d\n\nThe 49ers have been dealing with depth issues at receiver all summer. To this point, their philosophy has been to push young players and hope some rise to the occasion. Watkins had been doing just that, and he\u2019d been in line to be the No. 3 or 4 receiver in Seattle.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why it was really unfortunate for Watkins to get that setback, because we really believe he could have helped us early,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cBut he needs to practice to be able to help us.\u201d\n\nWatkins played 39 snaps Saturday, the second most on the 49ers, and wasn\u2019t bothered by the ankle after the game. It started to hurt the next day, however, and an MRI revealed the sprain.\n\u2022 While Cowing performed well during his Sunday check-up, cornerback Renardo Green (hamstring) and defensive end Yetur Gross-Matos (knee) were not as far along and will miss another week of practice.\n\nUpton Stout (calf) was out Monday, but Shanahan said the rookie cornerback might return for Thursday\u2019s joint practice. Linebacker Tatum Bethune (ankle) went through individual drills Monday but was held out of team situations.\n\u2022 The 49ers activated offensive tackle Andre Dillard (ankle) from the physically unable to perform list, giving them a true swing-tackle option for the first time this summer. To this point, backup tackles Spencer Burford (left) and Austen Pleasants (right) have practiced at only one spot. Dillard practiced at left tackle with the third-string offense on Monday as he gets eased back into the mix.\n\u2022 Defensive tackle Evan Anderson (knee), safety Ji\u2019Ayir Brown (ankle) and linebacker Chazz Surratt (unknown) were back after sitting out recent practices. Brown lined up with the second-team defense, while Jason Pinnock and rookie Marques Sigle practiced with the first-stringers. Surratt filled in at middle linebacker with the second-team group.\n\u2022 The 49ers signed running back Jeff Wilson Jr., who was with them from 2018-22, and placed running back Ameer Abdullah (ribs) on injured reserve. They also waived fourth quarterback Tanner Mordecai, who, along with third quarterback Carter Bradley, struggled on Saturday.",

      "text": "SANTA CLARA, Calif. \u2014 The San Francisco 49ers raced out to a 9-0 lead against the Denver Broncos on Saturday night, notable because it was quarterback Mac Jones and a slew of second-stringers on offense and defense versus the Broncos\u2019 starters in the first quarter.\nAfter that, the game dissolved into, well, a typical preseason opener. Which is to say, it was full of penalties (20 total), mistakes and missed tackles, most of them by 49ers backups who lost the early momentum and fell 30-9.\nAdvertisement\nStill, there were some promising performances, including by several rookies. Here were the top three standouts, followed by three players who fell flat in the summer opener.\nThree up\nNCB Chase Lucas\nLucas got two of the 49ers\u2019 nine points when he blitzed out of the slot and forced Broncos quarterback Bo Nix into an intentional grounding penalty in the end zone. Defenses don\u2019t always reveal their blitzes in the preseason, but defensive coordinator Robert Saleh told Lucas before the game that he\u2019d be aggressive with his calls.\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m gonna let it rip,\u2019\u201d Lucas said. \u201cI said, \u2018Man, if you\u2019re gonna let rip, I\u2019m going to show you some things.\u2019 He stuck to his word, and it ended up going in our favor.\u201d\nSafety! @49ers add two points to their lead\nStream on @NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/1nNFaGuQVq\n\u2014 NFL (@NFL) August 10, 2025\nLucas got the nod at nickel cornerback because promising rookie Upton Stout is dealing with calf tightness, and the 49ers decided to be cautious with him.\nLucas, who spent 2024 on San Francisco\u2019s practice squad, also had a nice third-down pass breakup on a would-be touchdown toss late in the first quarter. But what will really jump out to coaches was his stout tackle on 227-pound running back Audric Estime on the first play of the third quarter and another big hit later in the quarter. Lucas led all defenders with eight tackles, five of them solo stops.\nDT Kalia Davis\nWho starts at defensive tackle on Sept. 7 in Seattle? Davis made a strong case Saturday, finishing with a sack, a quarterback hit and a splash play in run defense in which he barreled down the line of scrimmage to snag speedy Broncos tailback Jaleel McLaughlin by the ankles. Davis, who started next to rookie C.J. West, led all 49ers linemen with three solo tackles.\n\u201cI thought he had a really good offseason last year and was having a good training camp, but then got hurt (in the preseason) at Tennessee pretty bad,\u201d Kyle Shanahan said. \u201cAnd it set him back a ways. But I think this offseason has been very similar. He\u2019s had a real good training camp, and I thought he had a good first half (Saturday), too.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nS Marques Sigle\nSigle was one of three rookies \u2014 West and receiver Jordan Watkins were the others \u2014 who started the game. Though he left late in the second quarter with a knee injury, he was active and involved early, leading San Francisco with seven tackles in the first half.\nShanahan said the preliminary indication was that Sigle suffered a knee bruise and nothing more serious.\n\u201cI thought he was one of the guys who flashed tonight,\u201d he said. \u201cHe got a little bit of a late start by being injured in the (spring). And it was a few days into camp until he really got going. But he\u2019s had a hell of a week here and finished it off good today.\u201d\nOne of the 49ers\u2019 Week 1 safety spots seems like it will go to Jason Pinnock. The other is up for grabs. One contender, Ji\u2019Ayir Brown, has been out with a lingering ankle issue, while another, Richie Grant, will miss roughly a week with a knee injury. Sigle, meanwhile, is the 49ers\u2019 fastest safety since Tarvarius Moore (third round, 2018), and that speed was apparent Saturday as he buzzed around the field. One of the questions with him is whether, at 6 feet, 199 pounds, he has the size to hold up at the position.\nHonorable mentions\nWR Junior Bergen: He was the top choice at kick and punt returner, taking back his first punt for 28 yards. It was a promising start for a rookie whose roster spot hinges on how well he returns punts.\nWR Jordan Watkins: He had a mixed outing, including running the wrong route on Jones\u2019 first-quarter interception. However, he also connected with Jones on a 50-yard pass that led to an opening-drive score. The play highlighted Watkins\u2019 strength: He\u2019s dangerous on deep balls.\nBig play from Jordan Watkins \ud83d\ude24\nStream on @NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/bMZF3strPi\n\u2014 NFL (@NFL) August 10, 2025\nDT Sebastian Valdez: The undrafted rookie has been turning heads in practice and looked good Saturday, too. He finished with four tackles, including a sack he shared with defensive end Robert Beal Jr.\nThree down\nQB Carter Bradley\nIn the second quarter, Bradley stared down receiver Russell Gage, leading Broncos linebacker Karene Reid to an easy interception. And that was just one of his miscues. He also had:\n- an intentional grounding penalty\n- a ball batted at the line of scrimmage\n- a delay-of-game penalty\n- a second interception that was erased by an unrelated Denver penalty\nBradley, the son of assistant head coach Gus Bradley, gave way to Tanner Mordecai having completed 6 of 14 passes for 32 yards and a 20.5 passer rating. Even his longest connection of the game, a 19-yarder to tight end Jake Tonges, was so underthrown that Broncos head coach Sean Payton challenged the completion.\nAdvertisement\nLB Nick Martin\nMartin looked a little like fellow weakside linebacker Dee Winters did in previous preseasons: His speed and athleticism were evident, but he was a bit all over the place and had three missed tackles on one series alone in the third quarter.\nWinters, who seems to have a lock on the weakside spot this year, started the game, giving way to Martin late in the first quarter.\n\u201cHe ran around, got a lot of playing time,\u201d Shanahan said of Martin. \u201cHe had a couple of misses, especially on a big third down on a shallow cross across the field. (He) got his eyes a little too nosy with the running back. I like how Nick\u2019s been going, but I think there\u2019s a lot (on Saturday\u2019s) tape he can get better from.\u201d\nT Spencer Burford\nBurford had trouble with speed rusher Nik Bonitto on back-to-back plays in the first quarter. Bonitto simply ran past Burford on second down, leading to a 1-yard sack of Jones. He did the same thing on third-and-long, resulting in a quarterback hit and a throwaway incompletion.\nShanahan said there were extenuating circumstances on both plays. On one, Bonitto was able to jump the snap because the 49ers were on a quick count. On the other, Burford was expecting someone to chip Bonitto on the outside, but that player missed the assignment.\nStill, the sequence seemed to highlight the 49ers\u2019 depth issues behind starting tackles Trent Williams and Colton McKivitz. Until Andre Dillard returns from offseason ankle surgery, Burford is the top backup for Williams, who hasn\u2019t played a full season since 2013.\nHonorable mentions\nQB Tanner Mordecai: He didn\u2019t fare any better than Bradley, completing 3 of 6 passes and also throwing an interception. His quarterback rating: 18.8.\nCB Tre Brown: He was the top nickel back in the spring. On Sunday, he played with the third-team defense, working opposite undrafted rookie Jakob Robinson, though he did force a fumble.\nAdvertisement\nVirtual review: The officials used the new measurement technology in the first quarter to determine whether the Broncos had picked up a first down. Two issues: 1. Anyone with working eyeballs could tell they were a couple of feet short. 2. The process took at least as long as the old-fashioned chain gang would have.\n(Photo of Chase Lucas, No. 26: Godofredo A. V\u00e1squez / Associated Press)"

      "text": "One might think it will be hard for coach Kyle Shanahan to pick 53 players after watching his team get outscored 30-0 in the last three quarters of Saturday\u2019s preseason opener against the Denver Broncos. As in, he might just stop at, say, 45.\nBut the San Francisco 49ers will have another couple of preseason games for untested and undrafted players to try to carve out spots for themselves. They can look to cornerback Chase Lucas, a practice squad player last year, and Sebastian Valdez, an undrafted rookie defensive tackle, as examples.\nAdvertisement\nLucas had a pass breakup, forced a safety on a blitz and also had five solo tackles against the Broncos.\n\u201cHe\u2019s kind of our Energizer Bunny,\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cHe was on the practice squad all last year doing it, helping on offense and defense. He\u2019s had a hell of a camp, and I thought he did a hell of a job.\u201d\nValdez is a 6-foot-3, 301-pound block of granite who benched pressed 225 pounds 34 times at his pro day at Washington. Niners offensive linemen respectfully call him \u201cHulk,\u201d and Saturday, he pushed his way to half a sack and a tackle for a loss.\n\u201cI\u2019d say he flashed the most (Saturday),\u201d Shanahan said. \u201cJust noticed him out there.\u201d\nMatt Barrows and Vic Tafur noticed some stuff as well, and here is their first stab at a 53-man roster projection:\nRookies in italics\nOffense (25)\nQuarterback (2): Brock Purdy, Mac Jones\nCut: Carter Bradley, Tanner Mordecai\nIR: Kurtis Rourke\nThe 49ers put their money on Purdy. And Jones had a touchdown drive against the Broncos starters on Saturday, so Shanahan is pretty happy with his top two quarterbacks. Let\u2019s never discuss the other two quarterbacks\u2019 performances from that night again.\nBrock Purdy\n49ers\n- Tier 2\n- Rank #14\n- Vote Avg. 2.5\nRunning back (5): Christian McCaffrey, Isaac Guerendo, Patrick Taylor Jr., Jordan James, Kyle Juszczyk (fullback)\nCut: Corey Kiner, Ameer Abdullah, Jeff Wilson Jr.\nMcCaffrey\u2019s return to health and being among the best players on the field has been the story of training camp. As for everybody else, the hope is that the walking wounded will be ready by the opener. Guerendo (shoulder) and James (finger) looked good before they went down, and the 49ers brought back old friend Wilson just in case. Taylor makes it for his special teams play.\nWide receiver (5): Jauan Jennings, Ricky Pearsall, Jacob Cowing, Russell Gage, Jordan Watkins\nPUP: Brandon Aiyuk\nLikely suspended: Demarcus Robinson\nAdvertisement\nCut: Junior Bergen, Terique Owens, Isaiah Hodgins, Robbie Chosen\nShanahan assured the masses again after the game that Jennings (calf) is really hurt and not just waiting for a new contract. We guess that is good news. Cowing could be back from a hamstring injury this week and will have a chance to hold off the rookie Watkins for a sizable role behind Jennings and Pearsall. Veterans Robinson and Gage have both had nice camps, which ought to give Shanahan some peace of mind with Aiyuk out until October.\nTight end (3): George Kittle, Luke Farrell, Brayden Willis\nCut: Jake Tonges, Ross Dwelley\nWillis, Tonges and Dwelley are similar in that they can do a little of everything and are reliable in the pass game. Though we think Willis has stood out slightly in training camp, the winner might be whoever special teams coordinator Brant Boyer likes most.\nOffensive line (10): Trent Williams, Ben Bartch, Jake Brendel, Dominick Puni, Colton McKivitz, Spencer Burford, Nick Zakelj, Austen Pleasants, Andre Dillard, Connor Colby\nCut: Isaiah Prince, Matt Hennessy, Drake Nugent, Drew Moss, Isaac Alarcon\nWhile some may have doubts about this unit, the coaching staff felt strongly enough that there wasn\u2019t really any competition for starting jobs. Bartch has stepped in for the departed Aaron Banks at left guard, and the staff is confident in the other three linemen improving as they flank future Hall of Fame left tackle Williams. The depth is shaky, but maybe Dillard, a 2019 Philadelphia Eagles first-round pick, can shore that up when he returns from an ankle injury this week.\nDefense (25)\nDefensive line (10): Mykel Williams, Jordan Elliott, Kalia Davis, Nick Bosa, Bryce Huff, C.J. West, Alfred Collins, Yetur Gross-Matos, Evan Anderson, Sebastian Valdez\nCut: Robert Beal Jr., Sam Okuayinonu, Jonathan Garvin, Jaylon Allen, Bruce Hector, Bradlee Anae\nAdvertisement\nIR: Kevin Givens\nCould Beal make the squad ahead of Valdez or Anderson? It\u2019s possible. He\u2019s looked good over the past few days and also has been playing on the 49ers\u2019 top special teams units. A recent groin injury, however, will be an obstacle.\nFlashes from the rookie \u26a1\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/0iQ1iDePb9\n\u2014 San Francisco 49ers (@49ers) August 10, 2025\nLinebacker (5): Fred Warner, Dee Winters, Nick Martin, Tatum Bethune, Luke Gifford\nCut: Chazz Surratt, Jalen Graham, Curtis Robinson, Stone Blanton\nWarner and Winters are every-down players, which means the other four must be core special teamers. Gifford is especially strong in that department.\nCornerback (6): Deommodore Lenoir, Renardo Green, Dallis Flowers, Tre Brown, Upton Stout, Chase Lucas\nCut: Darrell Luter Jr., Jakob Robinson, Fabian Moreau\nThe player to watch at this position is Robinson, the undrafted rookie who\u2019s been sticky in coverage. The 49ers tried to get D\u2019Shawn Jamison, a cornerback with a similar pedigree, to the practice squad two years ago, and he was claimed off waivers by the Carolina Panthers.\nSafety (4): Jason Pinnock, Ji\u2019Ayir Brown, Richie Grant, Marques Sigle\nCut: Derrick Canteen, Jaylen Mahoney, Siran Neal\nPUP: Malik Mustapha\nPinnock has a big lead at one of the starting safety spots. The other? It\u2019s a three-man race among Brown, Grant and Sigle, who looked good in his NFL debut. Neal might merit consideration as a core special teamer. He was on all the main units on Saturday.\nSpecial teams (3)\nPK Jake Moody, P Thomas Morstead, LS Jon Weeks\nThere\u2019s no competition at any of these spots, and Moody didn\u2019t even attempt a field goal against the Broncos. He\u2019s had mixed results in the 49ers\u2019 next venue, Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas.\n(Top photo of Sebastian Valdez chasing Broncos QB Jarrett Stidham: Thearon W. Henderson / Getty Images)"

      "text": "SANTA CLARA, Calif. \u2014 San Francisco 49ers rookie Jordan Watkins was a surprise standout this spring, showing his speed on deep balls and his smoothness on crossing routes and drawing raves from quarterback Brock Purdy, who said Watkins \u201cpopped out\u201d to everyone.\nWell, not exactly everyone.\nAsked his assessment, Kyle Shanahan wasn\u2019t nearly as effusive.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI think Jordan\u2019s doing solid,\u201d he said June 10. \u201cHe\u2019s had some good days, some bad. But normal.\u201d\nIt was a shoulder shrug of a comment but one that probably should have been expected. The 49ers head coach, a former college receiver, is famously fussy when it comes to rookie pass catchers, and only a few have met his high standards.\nDeebo Samuel, for example, played 709 snaps as a rookie in 2019, and Brandon Aiyuk logged 728 the following season, though neither escaped unscathed. Samuel\u2019s weight was an issue early on, resulting in long, pre-practice runs with then-receivers coach Wes Welker. Aiyuk, meanwhile, sidestepped Shanahan\u2019s microscope in 2020 in part because the offseason was discombobulated by COVID-19 restrictions. The pandemic, however, merely delayed the tough-love sessions until 2021, when Aiyuk landed in Shanahan\u2019s doghouse in the run-up to the season.\nBoth ultimately survived. Others, such as Dante Pettis, Jalen Hurd, Danny Gray and Ronnie Bell, did not. They were cut well before their rookie deals expired.\nWatkins says he got an early \u2014 and accurate \u2014 heads up on Shanahan\u2019s standards from relatives who are 49ers fans in his native Kentucky. Despite his impressive spring, he has gotten plenty of film-room critiques from position coach Leonard Hankerson, who channels Shanahan.\n\u201cI\u2019ve messed up on pass-game stuff, I\u2019ve messed up on splits, I\u2019ve messed up on run game,\u201d Watkins said after Friday\u2019s practice. \u201cBut that\u2019s part of it. It\u2019s part of being a rookie. Coach Hank is super, super hard on me. And I wouldn\u2019t want it any other way. Because the NFL\u2019s a tough, tough business.\u201d\nThe rookie mistakes haven\u2019t curtailed his practice repetitions. Observers often can tell where a 49ers receiver stands in the pecking order by where he lines up in individual drills. For example, veterans Jauan Jennings and Demarcus Robinson \u2014 who have been far and away the most consistent targets early in training camp \u2014 get to go first in the drills. Because the 49ers are practicing without Aiyuk (ACL), Ricky Pearsall (hamstring) and Jacob Cowing (hamstring), Watkins has been the third man up in those drills and is usually the third receiver who gets worked into team-wide situations.\nAdvertisement\nThat underscores the opportunity in front of the fourth-round pick from Ole Miss. Aiyuk isn\u2019t expected to be ready early in the season while Robinson could be serving a suspension related to his DUI. Watkins seems very much in the mix to be the No. 3 or No. 4 wideout when the season begins in Seattle on Sept. 7. He and fellow rookie Junior Bergen also have been the only punt returners in recent practices.\nWho\u2019s the 49ers\u2019 No. 3 receiver? It\u2019s an excellent question heading into the season. As it stands now, rookie Jordan Watkins seems firmly in the mix \u2026\n[image or embed]\n\u2014 Matt Barrows (@mattbarrows.bsky.social) July 25, 2025 at 3:14 PM\nOf course, Watkins has to satisfy Shanahan first. And through the first three days of training camp, he hasn\u2019t been nearly as prolific as he\u2019s been in the spring. Practices are more physical, cornerbacks such as Renardo Green and Deommodore Lenoir are allowed to use their hands and re-route him, and the throwing lanes are tighter. Friday, for example, Watkins hauled in only one of the six passes in his direction.\nHis reaction to the tough defense is the same as it is to the hard coaching he\u2019s getting from Hankerson: Bring it on.\n\u201cObviously, with more physicality, it\u2019s going to be tougher to get open and make plays,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s our job in the NFL as a receiver. The windows are very, very close. Very, very close. Whenever I\u2019m lining up against Green and Lenoir, that\u2019s the competition I want. Because that\u2019s the best of the best right there. \u201d\nOdds and ends\n\u2022 The most notable absence Friday: Purdy, who\u2019s expecting the birth of his first child. That left the 49ers with two healthy quarterbacks: Mac Jones and second-year player Tanner Mordecai.\nJones took all of the first- and second-team repetitions and finished 12-of-19 in team situations. He hit George Kittle and running back Patrick Taylor Jr. for big gains and also had a nice hot-read throw to Jennings on a blitz from rookie linebacker Nick Martin.\nHe threw one interception when he followed Watkins across the field, allowing safety Ji\u2019Ayir Brown to read his eyes and step in front of the ball.\nFlying around \ud83d\ude24 pic.twitter.com/RE8rHAqbZK\n\u2014 San Francisco 49ers (@49ers) July 25, 2025\nThe big-armed Mordecai was 9-of-13. He also had an interception when linebacker Jalen Graham picked off a short pass intended for tight end Jake Tonges. Seventh-round pick Kurtis Rourke, the team\u2019s fourth quarterback, is recovering from an ACL injury and has yet to practice.\n\u2022 Green was perhaps the biggest standout of practice. The second-year cornerback had back-to-back pass breakups on throws to Jennings and Watkins and a third on an underthrown deep ball from Jones to Jennings. However, Green was later seen limping off the field with what seemed like a leg injury. He did not return.\nAdvertisement\nMeanwhile, two of the feistiest players on the roster \u2014 Jennings and Lenoir \u2014 got into a brief but fiery dustup after an outside run by Christian McCaffrey. Jennings, who is perhaps the most physical run-blocking receiver in the league, was blocking Lenoir on the play.\n\u2022 The 49ers seem to be experimenting with three scenarios when three cornerbacks are on the field:\n1. Lenoir, Green and Tre Brown (nickel)\n2. Lenoir, Green and Upton Stout (nickel)\n3. Green, Brown and Lenoir (nickel)\nThe team mostly has used the first scenario during the spring and early days of training camp, but Stout, the third-round draft pick, has looked sharp when he\u2019s on the field.\n\u2022 The 49ers\u2019 kicking competition, which got off to a perfect start Wednesday, hit a snag Friday. Jake Moody was 3-of-4 on his attempts, and Greg Joseph was 2-of-4. He pushed one attempt wide right, and his final attempt went off the left upright.\n\u201cI thought they could have had a better day today, but they\u2019re doing a good job so far,\u201d special teams coordinator Brant Boyer said.\nBoyer is having the kickers alternate attempts to ramp up the pressure and competition. Moody tends to watch Joseph\u2019s kicks from near the sideline. Joseph faces away from Moody and practices his kicking motion while Moody is kicking.\n\u201cIf a guy misses, can the other guy make (the kick) right after?\u201d Boyer said. \u201cThat\u2019s all the kind of stuff you look for, the competition element. That\u2019s what I want to see.\u201d\nBoyer and others have linked Moody\u2019s rough 2024 season to the kicker coming back too quickly from a midseason high ankle sprain.\n\u201cI see a guy who lost his confidence a little but also a guy who was injured half the year,\u201d Boyer said. \u201cHe\u2019s a super-talented kid and has to get his stinger back, so to speak. Greg is putting on all the pressure he can. And like I said, that\u2019s going to heat up. That battle is going to be fun to watch as we get into the preseason games, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n\u2022 Friday\u2019s practice was the third before a players\u2019 day off Saturday, which meant it was longer than Wednesday\u2019s opener but not quite as intense as Thursday\u2019s. Pearsall is expected back Sunday, though fellow second-year wideout Cowing likely will be out a little longer. Left guard Ben Bartch (quadriceps) also seems close to returning.\n\u2022 Ji\u2019Ayir Brown\u2019s interception came when he was lined up with the second-team defense. The first-team repetitions at safety went to Jason Pinnock and Richie Grant.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wide-open competition at safety, at both spots,\u201d defensive coordinator Robert Saleh said Thursday.\n\u2022 Most of the 49ers\u2019 rookies worked with the second- and third-team units. The exceptions have been defensive end Mykel Williams and Stout, who gets occasional repetitions with the first-string defense.\n\u2022 Brayden Willis, who is competing for the No. 3 tight end spot behind Kittle and Luke Farrell, had four catches Friday. Tonges, Ross Dwelley and Mason Pline are also vying for that role.\n(Photo: D. Ross Cameron / Imagn Images)"

  "argos_summary": "The San Francisco 49ers are facing significant challenges in their wide receiver corps as rookie Jordan Watkins has been diagnosed with a high-ankle sprain, sidelining him for about a month. Coach Kyle Shanahan indicated that other key players, including Brandon Aiyuk and Demarcus Robinson, may also miss time due to injuries and a potential suspension, respectively. Despite these setbacks, the team is looking to young players to step up, with Jacob Cowing showing promise as he returns from a hamstring injury.",
