  "content": "The Democratic Mayors Association slammed President Trump\u2019s announcement to federalize Washington, DC\u2019s police force on Monday, calling it a \u201cpolitical charade.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Crime is down in most major cities \u2014 including Washington, DC \u2014 in spite of Donald Trump, not because of him. If Trump actually cared about reducing crime, he wouldn\u2019t have made unprecedented cuts to public safety programs that actually work. If Trump actually cared about our communities, he would be working with our cities, not against them,\u201d the Democratic Mayors Association said in a statement.\n\n\u201cBut the truth is Trump doesn\u2019t care \u2014 he only wants to create yet another political charade to serve his own interests and distract Americans from his failures. While Trump may try to vilify Mayors and take credit for their work, Democratic Mayors will never stop fighting to protect and strengthen our communities because that\u2019s what they do \u2014 they get things done,\u201d he continued.\n\nOther Democrats were also quick to criticize the president\u2019s actions, calling it a distraction.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s economy is failing, his Epstein files cover-up won\u2019t go away, and public support for his agenda is way down. So it\u2019s no surprise that he is trying to distract the American public,\u201d said House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Robert Garcia (D-Calif.)\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said Trump has \u201czero credibility\u201d on crime.\n\nThe statement came after Trump announced on Monday that in addition to taking federal control of the city\u2019s police department, he would deploy the National Guard in an effort to take on crime in the city. The president also announced that he was declaring a public safety emergency in the District.\n\n\u201cOur capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people, and we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore. We\u2019re not going to take it,\u201d Trump said from the White House press briefing room.\n\nUnder the Home Rule Act, Trump can temporarily take control of the District\u2019s police department if he determines \u201cspecial conditions of an emergency nature exist.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear if the administration worked with D.C. officials ahead of the announcement. A spokesperson for Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s (D) office declined to comment just before Trump began speaking.\n\nD.C. Councilmember Charles Allen (D) pushed back on Trump\u2019s announcement, calling it \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cextreme.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President taking over local control of MPD & putting the US military onto the streets of DC under the guise of public safety is wrong,\u201d Allen said in a post on X. \u201cIt\u2019s an extreme, outrageous, and dangerous move for our city and the safety of all our residents. \u201c",
