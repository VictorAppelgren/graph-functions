  "description": "Brandon Andrews \u2014 entrepreneur, investor, and \"Shark Tank\" casting expert \u2014 shares insider tips on how to pitch like a pro.",
  "content": "You\u2019ve spent a lifetime building skills, learning lessons, nurturing relationships, and developing a perspective as prescient and powerful as your personal drive. You\u2019ve poured it all into your business. Now, you have five minutes (or less) to communicate an irresistible vision for the world and convince a panel of respected \u2014 and sometimes disrespectful \u2014 judges that you can make the vision real and make some money. How do you do it?\n\nA pitch competition is a unique moment: I have pitched in, judged, and hosted pitch competitions from Miami to Mongolia. I\u2019m an entrepreneur and investor, and I\u2019ve spent a decade doing casting for \u201cShark Tank\u201d and other business television shows. Each year, I meet thousands of entrepreneurs around the world, evaluate their companies, and help them prepare for their big moment.\n\nI hosted The Pitch Battle at TNW Conference in June. The contest \u2014 won by Dutch startup Tap Electric \u2014 captured what can make a founder\u2019s story stand out. Whether you\u2019re pitching to the Sharks or rocking the stage at a tech conference, here are a few key elements that make a pitch successful:\n\nYes, nerves. While many people dedicate time and money to overcoming and outperforming nerves, I believe nerves are a critical element to any successful pitch. Why? Nerves mean you care. Some people fear public speaking, others are struck by the moment and what the funding or exposure could mean for their business, and no one wants to submit a performance that doesn\u2019t resonate. These are all reasons to care about the pitch. These are all reasons to feel something \u2014 before, during, and after.\n\nEntrepreneurs who open themselves to feeling the promise, intensity, and excitement of the moment create the opportunity for those feelings to fuel a passionate pitch. Feeling the moment without being consumed by the moment is a key element to a successful pitch.\n\nA successful pitch begins long before you step on stage. Know your audience and judges. Find out who will be in the room, what they care about, and how you will be scored. In practice, this means researching the judges\u2019 backgrounds and motivations. An angel investor might prioritise traction or business model, while a corporate sponsor might look for strategic alignment. Other judges may target companies that can \u201cdo the most\u201d with the funding or resources provided.\n\nDon\u2019t try to pitch everyone at once. Target the group that matters most to this competition, and give them confidence in your understanding of the market, their motivations, and how to move forward.Business\n\nWhatever stage your business is in, tell your story, and clearly articulate how you will use the resources available and/or being requested to reach KPIs that resonate with the judges and overall competition.\n\nStart by painting a vivid picture of the pain point. Then explain how your product or service addresses that problem in a novel way, highlighting any unique technology or approach. Next, emphasise real-world examples or user stories to make it relatable.\n\nLastly, define the market opportunity beyond the Total Addressable Market (TAM). Yes, decision-makers want to know that your business has the market potential to grow and scale. More than that, judges want to know how you will use the resources available to reach the market and convert.\n\nWhat do the resources available to the winner of the competition mean in terms of customer touchpoints? What do the touchpoints mean in terms of conversions? What do the conversions mean in terms of top-line revenue? And what does that revenue mean for the path to profitability?\n\nConnect with the audience. Let their energy fuel you. Invite them to participate. Building a genuine connection with your audience can set you apart. Bring energy and enthusiasm to the stage. Smile, make eye contact, and move with purpose. These simple actions help turn a formal pitch into an engaging conversation.\n\nInvite the audience to engage with you and your business early and often. Ask a question, weave in a call-and-response, ask for a show of hands, share links \u2014 all of these pieces can drive engagement beyond the pitch.\n\nInternalise your pitch instead of memorising it to be ready for the unexpected. Pitch as if you\u2019re telling an exciting story to a friend rather than reading slides. This real connection \u2013 eye contact, enthusiasm, and a two-way feel \u2014 makes your message resonate.\n\nYou would be surprised at how many entrepreneurs pitch their businesses without having a clearly defined ask. As a business owner, you should have an ask for any audience you find yourself presenting to. It is up to you to know what resources are needed to take your business to the next level and to ask for those resources.\n\nDon\u2019t leave the most important part as a surprise \u2014 always include a clear, specific ask. Your ask is central to the pitch, and it tells the judges exactly what you need and why.\n\nIf the competition has defined prize amounts or other resources, include a nod to these resources in the ask. Let the judges and audience know that you have thought about how winning this competition will help you build your business in a practical way.\n\nAs is often the case, if your business needs additional funding or resources beyond those available during the competition, mention this broader need. Explain how the resources from the competition will support your pursuit of these resources.\n\nA good pitch isn\u2019t a single moment in time. Documenting the preparation, pitch, and results can be an incredible way to connect with your audience. Creating clips and other content from your pitch can set your business up for success long after you drop the mic on stage.\n\nTreat the entire process as valuable content. Document everything: your application, your acceptance into the competition (an accomplishment in and of itself), prep work, practice sessions, final slides, and even your nerves!\n\nRecord your practice pitches on video whenever possible so you can refine your delivery and also reuse clips later. After the event, save your pitch deck, photos, and videos. These materials become marketing gold. Take the polished two- to three-sentence \u201celevator pitch\u201d and use it in email newsletters, on your website, or in social media posts.\n\nWrite a short blog or LinkedIn post about your pitch experience \u2014 what you learned, the outcome, and any other insights you gained. Keep your community updated: this visibility can attract customers, partners, and even future investors. Leverage social media and other channels to amplify your story.\n\nA winning pitch is built on preparation, clarity, and connection. Research your judges, tell a crisp story, engage your audience, get specific about the resources and go-to-market strategy, make a confident and relevant ask, and then turn that one presentation into many pieces of compelling content.\n\nThese elements work together to make your pitch memorable and effective. A pitch including them can supercharge a business and accelerate your path towards growth.",

  "summary": "Entrepreneur and investor, Michael Kohn, author and host host of pitch competitions around the world, has shared his tips on how to pitch successfully in a pitch competition. He believes that nerves are a crucial element to a successful pitch, as they provide an irresistible vision for the world and convince judges that it can make the vision real and make money. These tips include knowing your audience and judges well-prepared for the pitch, understanding their motivations and priorities, and defining the market opportunity beyond the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for growth and scale. Clear communication with the audience, engaging them early and often, and engaging them with a genuine connection to your business. Know what resources are needed to take your business to the next level and ask for specific resources. Kohn suggests that while presenting a pitch, leaving the most important part of the presentation is always clear and making it more engaging.",

The entrepreneur can make a handshake deal (gentleman's agreement) on the show if a panel member is interested. However, if all of the panel members opt out, the entrepreneur leaves empty-handed.[6]\nThe show is said to portray \"the drama of pitch meetings and the interaction between the entrepreneurs and tycoons\".[8] A pitch of around 45 minutes by a contestant is edited to about 11 minutes.[9] As of 2018, approximately 35,000 to 40,000 entrepreneurs apply each season with about 1,000 advancing to the next step, 150 getting to pitch the sharks, and fewer than 100 making it on the air; most episodes contain four pitches per broadcast hour.[10][11]\nPost-show\n[edit]Shark cast member Kevin O'Leary believes about 20% of the handshake deals made on the show are never executed[11] due to the investors' due diligence process following the handshake deal, which includes product testing and examining the contestants' business and personal financials.[12] Fellow shark Robert Herjavec believes that about 90% of those withdrawals come from the entrepreneur, in some cases due to only appearing on the program for publicity.[13]\nThe show is often responsible for what has become known as the Shark Tank effect.[14] Simply appearing on the show, even without getting an offer, has the potential to significantly boost sales for companies.[15] Some entrepreneurs have reported 10- to 20-fold increases in daily revenues after the show's airing.[16]\nCast\n[edit]Sharks\n[edit]Two of the show's longstanding sharks, Robert Herjavec and Kevin O'Leary, are Canadian entrepreneurs who had previously appeared on the Canadian version of the series titled Dragons' Den. Since 2023, Herjavec also appears on the Australian version of Shark Tank.\nNotable companies\n[edit]Some notable companies that have appeared on Shark Tank include:\n- Bombas\n- Breathometer\n- Coffee Meets Bagel\n- Doorbot, now known as Ring (acquired by Amazon) \u2013 first entrepreneur to appear as a (Guest) Shark\n- Kodiak Cakes (did not reach a deal)\n- Scan (acquired by Snapchat)\n- Scrub Daddy\n- Groove Book (acquired by Shutterfly)\n- Talbott Teas (acquired by Jamba Juice)\n- Manscaped\n- Plated (acquired by Albertsons)\n- Mr. Tod's Pies - first product featured on Shark Tank on August 9, 2009\nDue to show popularity, companies have falsely advertised that they've appeared on Shark Tank[17] when the air rate is 0.22% (88 aired of 40,000 applicants for 2018 season).[10][11] A full list of companies that actually appeared on Shark Tank can be found on ABC's website,[17] with cult following websites such as AllSharkTankProducts.com, SharkTankContestant.com, Sharkalytics.com, SharkTankTales.com, and SharkTankSpotlight.com[18] documenting details and products for all companies, and Gazette Review documenting episode recaps and updates on what happened \"after Shark Tank\".[19]\nEpisodes\n[edit]As of October 18, 2024,[update] 359 episodes of Shark Tank have aired, currently in its sixteenth season. Shark Tank's sixteenth season premiered on October 18, 2024.\nTimeline\n[edit]Early seasons (2009\u20132013)\n[edit]Shark Tank premiered in August 2009 and aired 14 episodes through January 2010. In August, it was renewed for a second season.\nSeason 2 premiered with a \"sneak peek\" episode on Sunday, March 20, 2011, before resuming its regular Friday night time slot on March 25, 2011. Season 2 had 9 episodes, 5 of them featuring new panel members. Comedian Jeff Foxworthy[20] and Mark Cuban replaced panel member Kevin Harrington in those episodes.[21] In season 2, Kevin O'Leary, Barbara Corcoran, Daymond John, and Robert Herjavec appeared in all nine episodes; Harrington appeared in four, Cuban in three, and Foxworthy in two.[22]\nShark Tank's third season premiered in January 2012.[23][24] From the third season, Kevin Harrington was replaced by Mark Cuban, while the \"queen of QVC\" Lori Greiner replaced Barbara Corcoran on 4 episodes. Kevin O'Leary, Daymond John, Robert Herjavec, and Mark Cuban appeared in all 15 episodes of season three. In February, ABC ordered two additional episodes for season 3 using unaired footage, which brought the season's episode total to 15.[25][26]\nOn May 10, 2012, Shark Tank was renewed for a fourth season consisting of 26 episodes.[27] This is the first time the series received a full season order.[28] Filming began on June 30, 2012. According to TV Guide, as of December 2012, the show's panel members had invested $12.4 million in the business opportunities presented to them during that season.[29]\nIn 2013, ABC renewed the show for a fifth season.[30] Season 5 premiered on September 20, 2013.[31] In October 2013, ABC ordered an additional two episodes for the season. In December 2013, ABC ordered another four episodes, bringing the season order to 29 episodes.[32][33] Steve Tisch and John Paul DeJoria were added as panel members.[34][35]\nCNBC syndication (2013\u20132015)\n[edit]In 2013, CNBC licensed exclusive off-network cable rights for the series from ABC.[36] In May 2014, ABC announced a sixth season starting in September 2014.[37] The series began its syndication run on CNBC on December 30, 2013.[38]\nThe seventh season of the show premiered on September 25, 2015.[39] Actor/investor Ashton Kutcher, music manager/CEO Troy Carter, and venture investor Chris Sacca all appeared as guest sharks.[40][41][42]\nNew set (2017\u2013present)\n[edit]The ninth season of the show premiered on October 1, 2017, with guest shark Richard Branson.[43] and a new, modern-looking set, Eames Lounge Chairs, penthouse views of a city, infinity pool, glass staircase to an upstairs lounge, and more space.[44][45][46]\nThe tenth season of Shark Tank subtitled \"Decade of Dreams\" premiered on October 7, 2018. The first episode of the 10th season marked the show's landmark 200th episode.[47]\nOn February 5, 2019, ABC announced at the TCA press tour that Shark Tank will return for an eleventh season,[48] which premiered on September 29, 2019.[49]\nOn May 21, 2020, ABC renewed the series for a twelfth season,[50] which premiered on October 16, 2020.[51]\nOn May 13, 2021, ABC renewed the series for a thirteenth season,[52] which premiered on October 8, 2021.[53]\nOn May 13, 2022, ABC renewed the series for a fourteenth season,[54] which premiered on September 23, 2022, with a first ever live episode.[55]\nOn May 16, 2023, ABC renewed the series for a fifteenth season,[56] which premiered on September 29, 2023.[57]\nOn November 27, 2023, Mark Cuban revealed that he would be leaving Shark Tank following the show's sixteenth season.[58] On May 10, 2024, ABC officially renewed the series for a sixteenth season,[59] which premiered on October 18, 2024.[60] During the season, frequent guest shark Daniel Lubetzky was promoted to one of the main sharks.[61]\nOn May 9, 2025, ABC renewed the series for a seventeenth season,[62] which is set to premiere on September 24, 2025.[63]\nProduction\n[edit]Shark Tank is produced by Mark Burnett and based on the format Dragons' Den, which originated in 2001 with the Japanese show, Tigers of Money.[4] Shark Tank, however, more closely resembles the format of the British version of Dragons' Den, which premiered in 2005.[64][65][29][66]\nThe show initially required each contestant to sign an agreement with Finnmax, the producer of Shark Tank, promising Finnmax the option of taking a \"2% royalty\" or \"5% equity stake\" in the contestant's business venture.[67] However, in October 2013, this requirement was repealed by the network, retroactively, due to pressure from panel member Mark Cuban.[68] Cuban felt the requirement would lower the quality of the entrepreneurs, as savvy investors would be wary of trading away a portion of their company just for appearing on the show.[67] A number of potential entrepreneurs had declined to participate in the show for this reason.[69]\nCOVID-19 precautions\n[edit]During the 12th season, the show was moved to Las Vegas, Nevada. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 12th season was produced in a quarantine bubble (which applied to the production staff but not the sharks or entrepreneurs themselves), the set was partially rearranged so the sharks' chairs were at least six feet away from each other, and the sharks would not come up to the entrepreneurs to shake their hands when a deal was made (a wave or \"long-distance fist bump\" was used instead). In future seasons, the handshakes returned but the chairs have remained separated.[70]\nSpin-offs and specials\n[edit]In 2015, ABC launched a companion series, Beyond the Tank, which shows the current state of companies that appeared on Shark Tank, including both those that made a deal and those that were rejected by investors.[71] Two seasons of Beyond the Tank have aired so far, one in 2015 and one in 2016.[72][73]\nA prime time special titled Shark Tank: Greatest of All Time premiered on February 26, 2020.[74]\nReception\n[edit]Critical reception\n[edit]During its first season, Shark Tank saw a mostly positive reception. Josh Wolk of Entertainment Weekly wrote, \"The moneymen ask informed questions and make shrewd decisions, a welcome relief from Donald Trump's capricious calls on Burnett's Celebrity Apprentice\".[75] Heather Havrilesky from Salon said that \"ABC's Shark Tank is easily the best new reality TV show to air this summer.\"[76] Tom Shales of The Washington Post wrote, \"It sounds gimmicky and visually tedious, with most of the so-called action taking place in a conference room. It's all those things, but the moments of misery make it memorable.\"[6] Shales noted that the series was premiering during an economic recession, and that many of the aspiring entrepreneurs had poured significant amounts of money into their businesses; he praised \"how deftly the show personalizes the desperation and pain experienced by victims of a broken down economy.\"[6] And David Hinckley of the New York Daily News said, \"Once you get past its somewhat misleading title, Mark Burnett's new Shark Tank is a well-paced hour that offers entertainment without humiliation.\"[77]\nRatings\n[edit]During the first two seasons, the series barely peaked at 5 million viewers, with season 2 only having 9 episodes in its run. By season 3, the show's viewership went past 5 million and started to crack the top 100 in the ratings. By 2012, the show averaged over 6 million viewers per episode. It is the most watched program on Friday nights in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic.[78] [citation needed] As a result, ABC added three more episodes to the original season order of 22.

Jimmy Kimmel has pitched on Shark Tank (pants for horses) as a comedy skit which aired on his show, Jimmy Kimmel Live![153] Disney's Phineas and Ferb character, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, pitched his invention on the 2013 season finale in a cross-over episode.[154] On the Season 6 Episode \"The Tank\" of Grace and Frankie, Grace and Frankie pitch their Rise Up toilet invention to the Sharks.[155]\nSaturday Night Live has parodied Shark Tank with Chris Rock pitching a parodied ISIS asking for support in going after \"Western pigs and vile Jews\",[156] prompting Daymond John to state that he found the skit \"insensitive\".[156]\nAfter the success of the original Shark Tank series, several countries have launched their own localized versions under the same name, adhering to copyright guidelines and obtaining rights to use the Shark Tank branding. Examples include Shark Tank India, Shark Tank Bangladesh, and Shark Tank Pakistan These adaptations retain the core concept of the show, where aspiring entrepreneurs pitch their business ideas to a panel of investors in hopes of securing funding, thus continuing the original show's influence and format across various markets. Today it was announced that the Lebanese channel LBCI is preparing a Shark Tank Lebanon and it will air soon in the fall season.\nSee also\n[edit]- American Inventor\n- Buy It Now\n- The Big Idea\n- Fortune: Million Pound Giveaway\n- List of Shark Tank investments\n- The Profit\n- Redemption Inc.\n- West Texas Investors Club\n- Win in China\nNotes\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ \"BBC Three \u2013 Dragons' Den US \u2013 Shark Tank\".

      "text": "Ah, the joys of pitching. Your entire masterplan squeezed into a few sentences, a room of powerful strangers with your future in their hands, and mere seconds to impress them. Who doesn\u2019t love a quick dip in a shark tank?\nQuite a lot of people, unfortunately. Luckily for them, pitching coach David Beckett is here to help.\nBeckett has spent decades mastering the art of public speaking. He first honed his skills through over 1,000 corporate presentations across 16 years at Canon, before switching to the crisper craft of startup pitches.\nIn 2013, Beckett founded Best3Minutes, which provides in-person and online training in his method. The techniques have now been taught to more than 1,800 startups and scaleups, which have gone on to raise over \u20ac420 million between them.\n\u201cMy goal is not to tell people what to say,\u201d Beckett tells TNW. \u201cMy goal is to give them a framework to find their story, practice it, and make it land with their audience.\u201d\nAt TNW Val\u00e8ncia on March 30, Beckett will provide his latest pitching workshop. Ahead of the session, he shared some of his top tips for startups.\n1. Tune in to your audience\nYour pitch needs to align with the desires of your audience. Who are they? What\u2019s important to them? How can you impress them?\nImagine you\u2019ve created a crypto-powered parking app. You could expound on the benefits of storing driver data on a distributed ledger, but few people enjoy torture by blockchain.\n\u201dWhen we work on something day in, day out, we often just want to tell people about what we\u2019ve built \u2014 but the audience might not care at all,\u201d says Beckett.\n\u201cThe execution comes from your product, process, and team.\nA more powerful pitch will illustrate a real-world impact. You could say (if it\u2019s true, of course) that people waste 20 minutes every day finding a parking space. With the click of a button, your app cuts the time down to 60 seconds.\nThat example, however, may not enthral everyone. To make your audience do what you want, you need to know who they are.\n2. Focus on the problem and solution\nYour pitch needs to focus on pain and gain. This should fit into a simple statement that reveals what you can do for customers.\nA human problem makes the issues more relatable. What does the pain result in? How big is the problem? Will people pay to solve it? How have you validated that? Investors want these answers.\n\u201cThings that especially trigger them are the size of opportunity and execution against that opportunity,\u201d says Beckett. \u201cAnd the execution part is product, progress, and team.\u201d\n3. Establish a clear objective\nA successful pitch results in action. The ultimate target is often a set investment, but startups normally need to take a different first step. It could be a follow-up meeting, an introduction, or scanning a QR code that shows the audience further information. The most important outcome is maintaining a connection.\nWhatever your objective, make it clear and memorable. You may only have a few minutes to convince your audience to take action.\n\u201cOf course, you can\u2019t communicate all the details in that time, but that\u2019s not really the goal,\u201d says Beckett. \u201cThe goal of the pitch is getting to the next step.\u201d\n4. Use post-it notes to organise your thoughts\nOnce you\u2019ve got an objective, you need a strategy to reach it. Beckett advises using post-it notes to get the ideas out of your head and into a storyline. To shrink the prep time, he also recommends downloading his Pitch Canvas, a free storytelling tool for structuring your pitch.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to deliver the pitch with certainty and passion when you haven\u2019t got the story straight,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve got the story straight, you can start going into the delivery part.\u201d\n5. Demonstrate your value\nInvestors want to see evidence that you can execute your plan. If you\u2019ve got customer traction, explain who\u2019s using the product. If you\u2019ve got a demo, show the product working. When time is short, a screenshot can suffice.\n\u201cIf you can convince them that it\u2019s a business, not a concept, they\u2019ll think differently about it,\u201d says Beckett. \u201cAnd what convinces people it\u2019s a business, not a concept, is a working product and customers.\u201d\n\u201cOnce they say things out loud, they often find what they wrote is too technical.\nIf your product is still a concept, there are other ways to demonstrate your value. One is showing you have the passion to put in the hours. Another is any funding that you\u2019ve already raised.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a couple of things that come from that. Firstly, people trust you. Secondly, you\u2019ve been through a due diligence process, so they\u2019re unlikely to get surprises.\u201d\n6. Captivate them with your opening\nYou need to quickly gain the interest of your audience. Investors can see up to 1,000 pitches a year and are always short on time. To capture their attention, your opening has to stand out.\nIf it doesn\u2019t land, says Beckett, their support \u201cis almost certainly going to be a no-go.\u201d\n7. Polish the delivery\nOnce you have a prototype pitch, it\u2019s time to verbalise it. Practice saying it out loud in front of an audience, and use their feedback to fine-tune your delivery. You can then take a step back and reassess the clarity, focus, and rhythm.\n\u201cOnce people start saying things out loud, they often find out what they wrote is quite technical, and want to make it more direct,\u201d says Beckett.\nYour delivery should emphasise the words that matter. Beckett uses the example of a fictional delivery startup. In a pitch, the founder plans to say, \u201cWe deliver a sustainable and energy-boosting doughnut to meetings near you.\u201d\nIf their focus is proximity, they can stress that doughnuts are delivered \u201cto a meeting NEAR YOU.\u201d If their USP is sustainability, they can emphasise that \u201cwe deliver a SUSTAINABLE and energy-boosting doughnut.\u201d If they\u2019re selling the energy effects, they can accentuate that it\u2019s a \u201cSUSTAINABLE and energy-boosting doughnut.\u201d\nYour delivery must also connect on a human level \u2014 a crucial element of pitching. Just one moment that shows your passion for the project can make an enormous difference.\n8. Manage your time with a script\nIn discussions about public speaking, the relative merits of spontaneity and planning are endlessly debated. For Beckett, the best balance depends on your allotted time.\nIn a half-hour corporate presentation, you might only need to memorise the opening. In a short pitch, however, you\u2019ll probably need a full script.\n\u201cFor a three-minute pitch, the pressure is too much for most people\u2019s brains to manage,\u201d says Beckett. \u201cIf they don\u2019t make a proper plan, they forget to say the things they really want to say, and spend too much time on things that are not so important.\u201d\n9. Time to perfection\nBeckett has done extensive research on our listening and speaking capacities. He\u2019s concluded that you should pitch a maximum of 150 words per minute.\n\u201cIf you speak faster than that, people can\u2019t follow,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s best to speak a bit slower so that people can process it. Get a bit of air around the key messages, but with enough energy and speed.\u201d\nThose 150 words will fit into approximately nine sentences. A three-minute pitch, therefore, will typically comprise around 27 sentences. If you\u2019re struggling to structure your story, those rough boundaries can help allocate the time.\nAnd if that doesn\u2019t quell the anxieties about being judged in a few minutes, just remember: it will all be over in a few minutes.\nDavid Beckett will be speaking at TNW Val\u00e8ncia, which takes place at the end of March.
