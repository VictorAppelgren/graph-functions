  "title": "Your Perfect \"Forever Mani\" Is Based On The Year You Were Born, According To TikTok",
  "description": "This nostalgic TikTok trend reveals the nail art that was trending the year you were born \u2014 aka the mani design you're meant to wear forever.",
  "content": "There was a distinct nail design that was trending the year you were born \u2014 and that\u2019s what you should always be wearing on your fingertips, according to TikTok.\n\nOn Aug. 8, creator @joannasaros posted a video with the text, \u201cType \u2018Nails 2025\u2019 [into the search bar] but replace \u20182025\u2019 with your birth year. That\u2019s the nails you have to wear for the rest of your life.\u201d This began a viral movement that\u2019s showcasing a flood of nostalgic designs that people are now using as mani inspo.\n\nThose born in 2022 will look back at glazed donut manis with yearning. From the chunky French tips of the late \u201990s to the rhinestone-studded Y2K claws of the early 2000s, every year had a dominant aesthetic. Now, TikTok is resurfacing them all.\n\nNails From The Year You Were Born\n\nThese days, nail art trends practically change every week. One moment, Italian summer designs decorated with tiny lemons and sardines are in. Next, everyone\u2019s rocking polka dot manis. But back in the day, manicures stood the test of time \u2014 and truly represented an era.\n\nThe nails you see when you search for your birth year might feel like a blast from the past, or oddly familiar. When creator @themilatorres looked up \u201cnails 1999,\u201d she saw square tips, hand-painted art, and eye-popping neons, and it was exactly what she was already wearing.\n\nOf course, the further back you go in time, the more likely the trend is to feel unfamiliar \u2014 or at least like something you\u2019ve only ever seen on your aunt. Look up \u201cnails 1997\u201d and you\u2019ll see lengthy, curved nail extensions, like @thechildofangela\u2019s gorgeous set. For 1996, it was all about the airbrush, while 1995 shows the grungy blacks, browns, and other muted earth tones that reigned in the decade. Creator @veryniceveryrare also showed model Carla Bruni\u2019s red quilted nails from a Chanel show that year, and it\u2019s so chic.\n\nThink about it: If you were to see a hot pink manicure with zebra print, you\u2019d immediately think of 2011. If you were to spy a shade of teal on someone\u2019s fingertips, you\u2019d be transported to 2016.\n\nOn July 27, creator @miiadelrey shared \u201cnail inspo for 2000s divas,\u201d featuring a colorful assortment of French tips in brown, baby blue, and pink with dainty design details, like mini flowers, swirls, and dots. (And yes, that look was huge that year.) In her comments, someone said, \u201cI\u2019m dead*ss using one of these for back to school.\u201d\n\nOf course, any age-related trend is always humbling for elder Millennials. Take it back to the \u201980s and you\u2019ll see gold details for 1989, color blocks and rainbow swirls for 1988, and pink metallic press-ons for 1987.\n\nAs creator @frantzwife joked, her 1986 nails are now officially \u201cvintage\u201d \u2014 though the light pink wash wouldn\u2019t be out of place on today\u2019s jelly nails.\n\nWhether it makes you nostalgic, inspired, or slightly existential, the birth-year nail search is a uniquely fun way to choose your next manicure. After all, these were the nails the world welcomed you with \u2014 so why not wear them again?",

You can DIY the design.\nIf you\u2019re looking for the ultimate mani, Hailey Bieber has the answer. And so do Sabrina Carpenter and Dua Lipa. The coolest of cool-girl celebs are all in agreement: It\u2019s a polka dot nail summer.\nThe \u201950s-esque retro chic pattern is back in a major way this season \u2014 not just in fashion, but on fingertips, too. Whether styled in bright, punchy hues or as a neutral French tip, dotted designs are suddenly everywhere\nMaybe you\u2019re trying to level up your mani game, or maybe you\u2019ve hit a nail art slump after cycling through every trend. Either way, polka dots are here for you (not that they ever really went out of style). The best part? It\u2019s simple enough to DIY your own set.\n\u201cIt\u2019s giving whimsy without going full cartoon,\u201d nail artist Franky Monet previously told Bustle. \u201cDots are one of the easiest ways to play with color and texture, and they have this effortless charm that feels super fresh right now.\u201d\nHere, find the cutest celeb sets for inspo.\nDua\u2019s French Polka Dot Mani\nPolka dots work for every occasion \u2014 even Paris Fashion Week. While wearing a bridal-esque feather-textured Schiaparelli couture gown, Lipa donned a set of cutesy dotted nails from celeb manicurist Michelle Humphrey. She wore them with a nude base and a black French tip with white polka dots. On the ring finger, Humphrey brought the dots down the entire nail for an easy accent.\nSabrina\u2019s Nude Polka Dot Nails\nFor Carpenter\u2019s \u201cManchild\u201d music video, she rocked the retro design, which was in line with her upcoming album\u2019s seemingly vintage inspiration. Celebrity manicurist Zola Ganzorigt crafted the singer\u2019s set, and even shared a tutorial for eager fans. After applying the neutral base, she used a dot tool and white polish to carefully place the tiny spots.\nHailey\u2019s Lemon-Dotted Set\nPolka dots are fun on their own, but Hailey Bieber took them to the next level with a pop of color. Created by her go-to artist Zola Ganzorigt, the set featured a bright yellow base with soft gray dots. In a tutorial, Ganzorigt showed just how simple polka dot nails can be \u2014 using just the tip of a pencil to dot on the polish."

      "text": "Nails\nTikTok's \"Millennial Teal\" Nail Revival Is So 2014 \u2014 In The Best Way\nThe throwback hue is experiencing a resurgence on social media.\nSometimes a single color defines an era. For the 2010s, it was undoubtedly \u201cMillennial teal.\u201d This bright shade of green-ish blue paired perfectly with the era\u2019s chevron skirts and owl necklaces, and it was often spotted next to its counterpart, brown.\nThanks to TikTok, the throwback hue is slowly making its way back into today\u2019s trends. At first, it was nothing but a joke \u2014 \u201cHaha, remember the chokehold teal had on us in 2014?\u201d But its cheuginess has evolved into a legit appeal, especially when it comes to nails.\nTeal just happens to be a classic vacation manicure color anyway, which makes its resurgence especially fitting for summer.\nThe best part? It\u2019s nostalgic in all the right ways. One swipe of teal polish can transport you back to high school, when your closet held eight identical tank tops and you begged your parents to paint your room \u201cHidden Sea Glass.\u201d\nFor the past 10 years, teal has been left behind in favor of Barbie pink, silver chrome, Brat green, cerulean blue, and butter yellow. But if you\u2019re ready to bring it back \u2014 and relive your glory days \u2014 these \u201cMillennial teal\u201d manicure ideas are the perfect place to start.\n12014 Fantasy\nTo fully live out your early 2000s fantasy, go for a wash of pure teal on your nails, like OPI\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Yacht Leaving\u201d or Essie\u2019s \u201cIn The Cab-ana.\u201d This would also look so cute on your toes.\n2Teal Tips\nA bright teal makes for a stunning yet unexpected French tip. It\u2019s also a fun way to ease into the color, especially if it gives you flashbacks to your awkward phase in 2016.\n3All That Glitters\nAn easy way to spice up a plain mani? Paint some glitter polish over a teal base. It\u2019s giving Limited Too.\n4Just A Hint\nTrace a soft circle of teal around your nail bed, then fill the center with a glossy pink. The color combo is equal parts nostalgic and pretty.\n5Dynamic Duo\nOnly true Millennials will appreciate the teal and brown color combo \u2014 which happens to look amazing on your nails. To bring the duo into 2025, add gold chrome accents and 3D details.\n6Silver Swirls\nMore of a silver girly? This metallic shade looks great next to teal, too. Combine swirls and varying shades of green-blue, aquamarine, and turquoise for a 2016-meets-2025 vibe.\n73D Aquamarine\nGive your teal mani design a mermaidcore twist by adding 3D water droplets and wave details. This French-style set is both trendy and a throwback.\n8Colorful Chrome\nA chrome finish always looks great, and this mani proves Millennial teal is no exception. The metallic glaze adds dimension that screams, \u201cGive me back my Christina Aguilera CD!\u201d\n9Pool Water\nTeal is the perfect shade to use for pool water nails. This swirled design mimics sunlight dancing on the deep end \u2014 and would look iconic wrapped around a slushy."

      "text": "Nailed It\nThe Crackle Nail Polish From Your 2000s-Era Caboodles Case Is Back\nFirst duck nails, now these.\nSome \u201990s and Y2K-era beauty trends are so nostalgic you feel compelled to try them again, even if they are a little bit ugly. See: duck nails, super skinny eyebrows, and frosted lips, just to name a few. Occasionally, an old trend will stick around and take on a whole new life, like shag haircuts and French manicures. But will that be the case for crackle nails?\nWith more than 11.7 million views on TikTok, it seems like crackle nails \u2014 also called shatter nails \u2014 are starting to make a comeback. To remember what they look like, try to remember the crackle-topped nail polish bottle in your Caboodles case.\nAccording to Juli Russell, a DIY nail expert for Sally Beauty, this special top coat creates a broken glass effect on your nails thanks to a unique formulation that causes the polish to contract and separate to reveal a different base color underneath. The result is a textured nail art design \u2014 and yes, it is so 2008.\nBack in the day, the coolest girl in your middle school would paint a white or black crackle top coat over a bright background, like hot pink or neon blue. The shattered effect also looked goth-chic over blood red or vampy purple shades, says Yongxi Tan, the co-founder of Bessie, a press-on nail brand. \u201cThe look was perfect for people who loved edgier fashion,\u201d she tells Bustle.\nCrackle Nail Polish Is Making A Comeback\nAccording to Russell, these nails were big in the \u201990s, but they became even more mainstream in the early 2000s when fun nail art really started to take off. Despite the popularity, though, she says crackle polish colors were limited to the white and black top coats.\nAs the look makes a return, it\u2019s now easier to find more finishes and formulas, like glittery greens, reds, and golds. The shattered look is playful, abstract, and a little bit funky, notes Russell, which fits right in with the myriad of experimental nail art that\u2019s so popular right now. Tan relates crackle polish to the recent crocodile print nail trend, thanks to its interesting texture.\nThink of it as another eye-catching option to try alongside chrome finishes and airbrushed aura manis. You could also take the trend up a Y2K notch with glow-in-the-dark colors \u00e0 la Kylie Jenner.\nIs Crackle Nail Polish Here To Stay?\nWhile crackle nails are cute, trends are cyclical, so there\u2019s really no telling how long this polish style will stay this second time around. \u201cAlthough the crackle polish trend brings a nostalgic charm, today\u2019s nail trends lean towards minimalism and timeless styles like classic reds and French tips,\u201d Russell says. Think simple, glossy designs like Sofia Richie Grainge\u2019s quiet luxury nails and Hailey Bieber\u2019s glazed donut tips \u2014 both a far cry from the more chaotic look of a crackle nail.\nHow To Wear Crackle Nails\nIf you love your crackle nail memories but still aren\u2019t sold on wearing them today, you can attempt to evolve into something a little more chic with the help of a glossy top coat or an on-trend base color, like chocolate brown. \u201cI\u2019m excited to see a modern twist on them,\u201d says Tan. And at the very least, they\u2019ll be perfect for the Halloween season.\nShop Crackle Nail Polish\nSources:\nJuli Russell, DIY nail expert for Sally Beauty\nYongxi Tan, nail expert, co-founder of press-on nail brand Bessie"

These analytics services help us understand how users arrive at and use our Services.\nOnline Advertising\nAs discussed above, the Services may allow third-party advertising technologies (e.g., ad networks and ad servers, or other advertising partners) to place cookies or other tracking technologies on your device to collect information about you to assist in the delivery of relevant advertising on the Services, as well as on other websites you visit and other online services you use. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.\nWe also sometimes provide your information (such as email addresses) to service providers, who may \u201cmatch\u201d this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites and mobile apps.\nWe neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on the device you use to access the Services by such non-affiliated third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative\u2019s Consumer Opt-Out link, the Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s Consumer Opt-Out link, or Your Online Choices to opt out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs.

We may also use your information for specific purposes to which you have agreed. We will ask for your consent to process your information for such purpose in accordance with applicable legal requirements.\nThe laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal grounds they rely on to process your information. Our legal bases for processing your information as described in this Policy are as follows:\n- Where use of your information is necessary to perform our obligations under a contract or commitment to you. For example, to provide the services you\u2019ve requested from us, or to comply with our legal terms and policies.\n- Where use of your information furthers our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others. For example, to provide security for our Services, operate our business and our Services, make and receive payments, defend our legal rights, and prevent fraud.\n- Where we use your information to comply with applicable legal obligations. For example, keeping track of your subscriptions for tax and auditing purposes.\n- Where you have consented to our processing of your information for a particular purpose.\nFor the purposes discussed in this Policy, we may combine the information that we collect through the Services with information that we receive from other sources, both online and offline, and use such combined information in accordance with this Policy.\nHow we disclose your information\nWe may disclose your information in the following ways:\n- Affiliated entities.

We use a variety of technical, physical, and organizational security measures designed to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information. However, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. As such, we cannot guarantee the security of your information.\nIf you create an account, it\u2019s important that you select a strong password and do not disclose it to others. Alert us immediately if you have any concerns about unauthorized use of your account.\nRetention of your information\nWe retain information for different periods of time depending on the purposes for which we collect and use it, as described in this Privacy Policy. We will delete or de-identify information when it is no longer needed to fulfill these purposes unless a longer retention period is required to comply with applicable laws. There may be technical or other operational reasons where we are unable to fully delete or de-identify your information. Where this is the case, we will take reasonable measures to prevent further processing your information.\nYour rights and choices\nWe provide you with the ability to exercise certain controls and choices regarding our collection, use, and disclosure of your information.

We will consider all requests and provide our response within the time period required by applicable law. Please note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests (e.g., where we are required to keep information for legal purposes, or where deletion of information would interfere with freedom of expression). If we deny your request in whole or in part, you may have the right to appeal the decision. In such circumstances, we will provide you with information regarding the appeals process.\nSale/Targeted Advertising. Under the laws in certain US jurisdictions, you also have the right to opt out of our processing or sharing of your information for online targeted advertising purposes.

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups, Internet browsers, technology companies, and regulators to develop a DNT technology standard. No standard has been adopted to date. As such, we do not generally respond to \u201cdo not track\u201d signals, nor do most other websites.\nHow to opt-out of third party data targeting & how to disable cookies\nIf you prefer not to receive interest-based content and ads enabled by Google, you can opt-out by clicking on the \u201cOpt Out\u201d link at either Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) (http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#/) or Digital Advertising Alliance\u2019s (DAA) (http://optout.aboutads.info/#/).

Dispute Resolution: Binding Arbitration Clause and Class Waiver.\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS\u2014INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT (BY REQUIRING YOUR DISPUTE TO BE SUBMITTED TO ARBITRATION) AND LIMITING YOUR RIGHTS TO RESOLVE YOUR DISPUTE AS PART OF A CLASS.\nAs detailed herein, the Terms of Service mandate that all disputes between you and BDG be resolved first through an informal dispute resolution process. In the event informal resolution fails, the Terms of Service further mandate that all disputes (except those identified in Section 11.3) be formally resolved through binding arbitration. Binding arbitration means that an arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve such disputes. Consequently, you should read the entirety of this Section 11 carefully as it may significantly affect your legal rights.\n11.1 Informal Dispute Resolution.\nFor any and all disputes between you and BDG, the parties shall use their best efforts to settle informally the dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and to engage in good faith negotiations. Failure to engage in this process could result in the award of fees against you in arbitration.\nTo initiate informal dispute resolution, the initiating party must first send a written description of the dispute to the other party. For any dispute against BDG that you initiate, you agree to send to BDG (a) a written description of the dispute and (b) the email address(es) associated with your account through the following email address: legal@bustle.com. The written description must be on an individual basis and provide, at minimum, the following information: your name; a description of the nature or basis of the claim or dispute; and the specific relief sought. For any dispute that BDG initiates, we will send our written description of the dispute to the email address associated with your use of the Services.\nIf the parties\u2019 dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the written description of the dispute by a party, you and BDG agree to resolve any remaining dispute through the additional dispute resolution provisions set forth below.\nA good faith engagement in informal dispute resolution shall be and is a prerequisite and condition precedent to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. The parties agree that any applicable statute of limitations period and filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process.\n11.2 Binding Arbitration\nAfter the parties have engaged in a good-faith effort to resolve their dispute(s) in accordance with the Informal Dispute Resolution process (Section 11.1), and only if those efforts fail, then either party may initiate arbitration as set forth in this Section.\nIf you determine to initiate arbitration, a copy of the arbitration demand must be emailed to legal@bustle.com. If BDG is initiating arbitration, it will serve a copy of the demand to the email address associated with your use of the BDG Services.\n(a) Mutual Arbitration Agreement\nExcept as set forth in Section 11.3 below, you and BDG agree that all claims, disputes, or disagreements that may arise out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, formation, or performance of these Terms of Service\u2014 including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these terms are void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment, non-payment, or timing of any administrative or arbitrator fees\u2014shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration in accordance with this Section 11.2 (collectively, the \u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d). The arbitrator shall be empowered under this Arbitration Agreement to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with the arbitration provider\u2019s rules and procedures for any frivolous claims or submissions the arbitrator determines have not been filed in good faith, as well as for a party\u2019s failure to comply with this Section 11.2.\nThis Arbitration Agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly, and it applies to claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this Arbitration Agreement or any prior agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Arbitration Agreement, in accordance with the notice opt-out provisions set forth in Sections 11.4 and 11.5.\nThis Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) in all respects and evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. You and BDG expressly agree that the FAA shall exclusively govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. If for whatever reason the rules and procedures of the FAA cannot apply, the state law governing arbitration agreements in the state in which you reside shall apply.\nExcept as set forth in Section 11.2(c) below, if any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to the parties\u2019 intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions thereof remain in full force and effect.\n(b) WAIVER OF RIGHTS INCLUDING JURY TRIAL\nTHE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT ARBITRATION MEANS THAT AN ARBITRATOR AND NOT A JUDGE OR JURY WILL DECIDE THE CLAIM, AND THAT RIGHTS TO DISCOVERY AND APPEALS MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. THE PARTIES FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION COULD EXCEED THE COST OF LITIGATION IN SOME INSTANCES.\nYOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS AND ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU AND BDG ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.\n(c) CLASS ARBITRATION AND COLLECTIVE RELIEF WAIVER.\nYOU AND BDG ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, AND EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET OUT IN THIS SECTION 11.2(c) AND SECTION 11.2(e)(vi) BELOW, ANY ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY ONLY AND NOT AS A CLASS OR OTHER CONSOLIDATED ACTION, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO RESOLVE AN INDIVIDUAL PARTY\u2019S CLAIM; NOTWITHSTANDING THIS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND AGREEMENT, ANY ARBITRATION INVOLVING YOU MAY PROCEED ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IF AND ONLY IF BDG PROVIDES ITS CONSENT TO CONSOLIDATE IN WRITING.\nIf there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this Paragraph\u2019s limitations as to a particular remedy, then that remedy (and only that remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be sought in court. The parties agree, however, that any adjudication of remedies not subject to arbitration shall be stayed pending the outcome of any arbitrable claims and remedies.\nIf there is a final judicial determination that either the Class Arbitration and Collective Relief Waiver in this Section, or that the provisions in this Section 11.2 are not enforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief, then the parties agree that that particular claim or request for relief may proceed in court as provided herein, but shall be severed and stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims. This provision does not prevent you or BDG from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.\n(d) Arbitration Location.\nIf you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place in the county where you reside. For residents in Canada (and anywhere else outside the United States), arbitration shall be initiated in the County of New York, State of New York, United States of America, unless you and BDG otherwise agree or unless the designated arbitrator determines that such venue would be unreasonably burdensome to any party, in which case the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select another venue.\nFor any arbitration conducted in the County of New York, State of New York, United States of America, You and BDG agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in New York County, New York, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and in connection with any such proceeding, further agree to accept service of process by U.S. or certified mail and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available\n(e) The Arbitration Rules.\n(i) The Provider.\nThe arbitration will be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (\u201cNAM\u201d) and resolved before a single arbitrator. If NAM is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitration provider.\nExcept as modified by this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d provision, NAM will administer the arbitration in accordance with the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, Fees For Disputes When One of the Parties is a Consumer and the Mass Filing Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions. The applicable NAM rules and procedures are available at http://www.namadr.com or by emailing National Arbitration and Mediation\u2019s Commercial Dept at commercial@namadr.com.\nYou are responsible for your own attorneys\u2019 fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.\nThe parties agree that NAM has discretion to reduce the amount or modify the timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under NAM\u2019s Rules where it deems appropriate, provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you further agree that you waive any objection to such fee modification. The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by NAM does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Section 11 while such challenge remains pending before NAM the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction, and that any and all due dates for those fees shall be tolled during the pendency of such challenge.\n(ii) Arbitration Demand Must Contain Sufficient Information.\nAny arbitration demand or counterclaim asserted by either party must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting party\u2019s identity, the claims being asserted, and the factual allegations on which they are based, and must include proof that the claimant is party to this Arbitration Agreement and to these Terms of Service. The arbitrator and/or NAM may require amendment of any demand or counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions for any claims the arbitrator determines to be frivolous or improper (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11), including for any claim filed on behalf of a claimant who is not a party to this Arbitration Agreement or to these Terms of Service.\n(iii) Arbitration Conducted on Papers in Some Circumstances.\nIf the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000 and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents that you and BDG submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, either party may request (or the arbitrator may determine) to hold a hearing. Any hearing shall presumptively be held via videoconference or telephone conference unless the arbitrator determines there is good cause to hold the hearing in-person or the parties agree otherwise, in which case the hearing will be held at the location identified in Section 11(d).\n(iv) Dispositive Motions.\nSubject to the applicable NAM rules and procedures, the parties agree that the arbitrator will have the discretion to allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute.\n(v) Batching.\nTo increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event 100 or more similar arbitration demands (those asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted to NAM (or another arbitration provider selected in accordance with Section 11.2(e)(i) if NAM is unavailable) against BDG within reasonably close temporal proximity (\u201cMass Filing\u201d), the parties agree (A) to administer the Mass Filing in batches of 100 demands per batch (to the extent there are fewer than 100 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch will consist of the remaining demands) with only one batch filed, processed, and adjudicated at a time; (B) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; (C) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined by NAM (or another arbitration provider selected in accordance with 11.2(e)(i) if NAM is unavailable) in its discretion; (D) that no other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the prior batch of 100 is filed, processed, and adjudicated; (e) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by BDG and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a set of batch proceedings and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; and (F) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each set including 100 demands, shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved. If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, any statute of limitation applicable to your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or settled.\nArbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted to the greatest extent possible in accordance with the applicable NAM rules and procedures for such selection, and shall be subject to any rights to strike an arbitrator provided under applicable state law if the rights granted by law exceed those provided for in the NAM rules, and the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings will be conducted.\nYou agree to cooperate in good faith with BDG and the arbitration provider to implement such a \u201cbatch approach\u201d or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims. The parties further agree to cooperate with each other and the arbitration provider or arbitrator to establish any other processes or procedures that the arbitration provider or arbitrator believe will provide for an efficient resolution of claims. For example, if the number of cases filed makes batches of 100 cases too small for the prompt resolution of all filed claims, you and we agree that NAM may increase or decrease the batch size, or transfer a case between batches in the reasoned discretion of the NAM procedural arbitrator. Any and all disagreements between the parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a NAM procedural arbitrator.\nThis \u201cBatch Arbitration\u201d provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM\u2019s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind.\n(vi) No Class or Consolidated Arbitration Absent Written Consent.\nUnless BDG otherwise consents in writing, which it may do on a case-by-case basis, BDG does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in Section 11.2(c) and this Section 11.2(e)(vi).\n(vii) Arbitration Award.\nThe arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the applicable NAM rules and procedures. The arbitrator\u2019s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant, on an individual basis, any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual to the extent available under applicable law, the arbitral forum\u2019s rules, and this Arbitration Agreement. The parties agree that the damages and/or other relief must be consistent with Section 11.2(c) above, and also must be consistent with the terms of the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d section of these Terms of Service as to the types and the amounts of damages or other relief for which a party may be held liable. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. Attorneys\u2019 fees will be available to the prevailing party in the arbitration only if authorized under applicable substantive law governing the claims in the arbitration.\n11.3 Exceptions to Arbitration.\nNotwithstanding the parties\u2019 agreement to resolve all disputes through binding arbitration as set forth in Section 11.2:\n(a) IP Disputes.\nEither party\u2019s claims of infringement or misappropriation of the other party\u2019s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret, shall be exclusively brought in the state and federal courts located in the City and County of New York, New York.\n(b) Small Claims Court and Statutes of Limitation.\nEither party may elect to have disputes or claims resolved in a small claims court regardless of what forum the filing party initially chose, provided the disputes or claims are within the scope of that court\u2019s jurisdiction.\nEither party may also seek a declaratory judgment or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party\u2019s claims are time-barred or may be in fact be brought in small claims court. Seeking such relief shall not waive a party\u2019s right to arbitration under this agreement, and any filed arbitrations related to any action filed pursuant to this paragraph shall automatically be stayed (and any applicable statute of limitations tolled) pending the outcome of such action.\n(c) Jurisdiction/Service of Process.\nFor any dispute not subject to arbitration under this Section 11, you and BDG agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located in New York, New York. You further agree to accept service of process by U.S. or certified mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.\n11.4 30-Day Right to Opt Out.\nYou have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice, signed by you, of your decision to opt-out to the following address: privacy@BDG.com. The notice must be sent within 30 days of the date the revision is posted or your first use of the Services, whichever is later; otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of Section 11.2. If you opt-out of the arbitration provisions, BDG also will not be bound by them.\nIf you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, you may exercise your right to a trial by jury or judge, as permitted by applicable law, but any prior existing agreement to arbitrate disputes under a prior version of the Arbitration Agreement will not apply to claims not yet filed. If BDG changes this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section after the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement), you agree that your continued use of the Services 30 days after such change will be deemed acceptance of those changes. If you do not agree to such change, you may opt out of the Arbitration Agreement by providing notice as described in Section 11.4.\nBDG will continue to honor any valid opt outs if you opted out of arbitration in a prior version of the Terms pursuant to the requirements set forth in that version. If you do not timely opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, such action shall constitute mutual acceptance of the terms of these \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d provisions by you and BDG.\n11.5 Changes to this Section.\nBDG will provide 30 days\u2019 notice of the date of any material changes to this Section 11. Changes will become effective on the 30th day and apply to all claims not yet filed. If you continue to use the Services after the 30th day, you agree that any unfiled claims are subject to the revised clause.\n12.
