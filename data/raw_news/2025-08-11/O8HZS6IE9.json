  "content": "Americans will have to wait several weeks for the Trump administration\u2019s next steps in its agenda to \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d according to three people familiar with the matter.\n\nWhile President Donald Trump\u2019s MAHA Commission will submit its strategy to the White House on Tuesday \u2014 sticking to an executive-ordered deadline \u2014 scheduling issues stand in the way of its public release.\n\nThe commission is \u201con track\u201d to deliver its report to the White House by August 12, White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. \u201cThe report will be unveiled to the public shortly thereafter as we coordinate the schedules of the President and the various cabinet members who are a part of the Commission.\u201d\n\nOfficials are aiming to launch their strategy by the end of this month, according to the three people familiar.\n\nThe commission\u2019s first MAHA report, issued in May, laid out the case that ultraprocessed foods, pharmaceutical prescriptions and environmental toxins are driving a crisis of childhood chronic disease in America. Much of the reports\u2019 findings echoed longtime arguments of health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who leads the commission.\n\nThe second installment is expected to propose strategies and reforms to tackle those issues. Actions can include, per the president\u2019s executive order, ending certain federal practices that \u201cexacerbate the health crisis\u201d and \u201cadding powerful new solutions.\u201d\n\nPublic health experts, MAHA supporters and industry advocates alike have been anxiously awaiting the commission\u2019s recommendations, and how far they will go.\n\nThere is lingering unease among farmers and agricultural groups after the first report flagged studies that suggest links between commonly used pesticides and various illnesses such as cancer and liver problems. Groups like the American Farm Bureau Federation called those \u201cunproven theories\u201d and warned that calling use of common pesticides into question could jeopardize Americans\u2019 confidence in the food supply.\n\nFederal health and agricultural officials sought to reassure farmers in the ensuing weeks. This month, a high-ranking Enviornmental Protection Agency official told attendees at a sugar industry conference that agencies would \u201crespect\u201d the current regulatory framework, as reported by DTN Progressive Farmer, an agriculture news and analysis company.\n\nAnother potential battleground is the federal path forward on ultraprocessed foods. Kennedy has led a public campaign for major food brands to voluntarily remove artificial additives and dyes from popular products, but nutrition advocates have pushed for the administration to crack down with regulations.\n\nThis month, a former leader of the US Food and Drug Administration challenged the agency to remove ultraprocessed foods from the market by essentially outlawing certain ingredients.\n\nBut some have remained skeptical that federal MAHA leaders will take drastic action.\n\n\u201cWe need policies to change big food and the food system, so it produces healthier foods,\u201d Jim Krieger, executive director of Healthy Food America, said in a news briefing Monday. \u201cWill [the MAHA commission] move beyond PR efforts, voluntary agreements and handshakes \u2014 none of which have really worked to improve the food system in the past \u2014 and suggest regulatory action with real teeth?\u201d",

So far, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has relied on popular food brands to volunteer to remove artificial dyes and other additives from their products.\n\u201cKessler has given the FDA a way to define the vast majority of ultra-processed foods. In doing so, he has handed RFK Jr a huge gift on the path to regulating these products. It\u2019s just what MAHA has asked for. I hope they take it seriously,\u201d Marion Nestle, the Paulette Goddard professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, said in an email.\nKessler proposed that companies have 12 months to submit a petition to keep those food additives in their products and then go on to prove they are safe.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very appropriate, worthy step to shift the burden of proof where it belongs and have the industry meet that burden, or stop using the substances.\u201d said Michael Taylor, a former FDA food regulator and current co-chair of the nonprofit STOP Foodborne Illness. \u201cIt\u2019s using the GRAS tool to really drive a serious safety conversation.\u201d\nHHS did not respond to a request for comment.\nFederal health officials announced last month that they are looking for input on how to define ultraprocessed foods, a first step in eventually setting up new regulations, which could take months to years to establish. Kessler\u2019s petition could put pressure on that ultimately lengthy timeline; the agency is required to respond to the request within 180 days.\nKessler, a physician who served as FDA commissioner under presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush, and advised President Joe Biden during the Covid-19 pandemic, oversaw the agency when it began requiring nutrition labels on food products.\nHe also spearheaded efforts for FDA to regulate tobacco in the 1990s and sees parallels to that fight.\n\u201cWhat was key in tobacco was finding the regulatory hook,\u201d Kessler told CNN. \u201cIt was about asking the right legal question that would frame the issue.\u201d\nThat has been the tricky part of setting up any regulatory standards for sugary and starchy foods, he said.\nThe term ultra processed foods has resonated with the public, he said, but \u201cit\u2019s going to be hard to define, legally, what\u2019s in it.\u201d\nBut there is a pressing need to do that, he argues. The FDA allowed these ingredients under GRAS regulations four decades ago, and rates of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease have climbed in the years since, he wrote in his petition. The argument echoes Kennedy\u2019s own case for MAHA reforms to food policy.\nA \u2018brilliant\u2019 move on processed foods\nThe petition focuses on refined flours and starches \u2014 which the body breaks down into sugars \u2014 that are subjected to food extrusion technology, including wheat, corn, tapioca, oat and potato flour. It also references refined sugars, including corn syrup, corn solids, dextrose, xylose, maltose, and high-fructose corn syrups. Finally, the petition targets any manufactured sugars, flours and starches that contain additives commonly used in today\u2019s ultraprocessed foods.\nTackling the issue of too much sugar is a key to better health, experts CNN spoke with agree, but they say the real genius of Kessler\u2019s petition is his focus on additives.\n\u201cThe food industry uses the emulsifiers, the stabilizers, the gels and the rest to make inexpensive, high volume, industrially processed foods,\u201d said Christopher Gardner, director of nutrition studies at the Stanford Prevention Research Center.\n\u201cIf you take those tools away from industry it\u2019s not that foods will taste bad and icky,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cThey won\u2019t be as addictive, as flavorful, as tasty \u2014 and industry has made these foods as manipulatively flavorful and manipulatively tasty. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d\nSeveral food and nutrition experts heralded Kessler\u2019s petition as a bold move that would, if enacted by FDA, reshape the food industry.\n\u201cThis is an important proposal that is based on the true meaning of GRAS, which would exclude the majority of foods on our grocery shelves,\u201d said leading nutrition researcher Dr. Walter Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston.\nThe GRAS standard, created in 1958, was originally intended to narrowly apply to commonly used ingredients in the nation\u2019s food supply, such as oil, vinegar and baking soda. Manufacturers that used those products could rely on existing research to show their safety but are supposed to file GRAS petitions for newer ingredients like refined sugars.\nFDA updated its system in the late 1990s \u2014 amid a backlog of petitions for new additives \u2014 allowing companies to voluntarily notify the agency that they had determined their ingredients were generally safe.\nA 2022 analysis conducted by the Environmental Working Group found that nearly 99% of new chemicals used in food or food packaging since 2000 were green-lit for use not by the FDA but by the food and chemical industry.\nDuring that period, food manufacturers asked the FDA\u2019s permission to introduce a new substance only 10 times, according to the analysis.\nBarry Popkin, the W. R. Kenan, Jr. Distinguished Professor at the Gillings School of Global Public Health in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, called Kessler\u2019s petition \u201ca brilliant move.\u201d\n\u201cKnowing the FDA like he does - he\u2019s put industry in a real bind,\u201d Popkin said. \u201cThey have to show that without a reasonable doubt that carbohydrates, along with additives, are healthy, and do not hurt health. And that\u2019s next to impossible.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the strongest play a citizen can do to affect our food supply that I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\nBut Kessler\u2019s proposed changes are likely to meet significant pushback from major food brands.\nMichael Taylor was FDA\u2019s deputy commissioner for foods in 2015 when the agency revoked the GRAS status of partially hydrogenated oils, or trans fats, citing extensive research about their links to risks of heart disease and stroke. The agency gave companies three years to comply and remove those oils from their products.\nBut at that time, \u201cthe handwriting was on the wall\u201d for industry and many companies had already stopped using those trans fats, Taylor said. \u201cObviously the substances that [Kessler] is describing, it\u2019s a lot of \u2026 highly processed, fine carbohydrates, and a lot of products.\u201d\nThe petition lands as Trump administration officials, led by Kennedy, prepare to release their second MAHA report. While the MAHA Commission\u2019s first dispatch in June singled out potential drivers of chronic illnesses in children \u2014 including ingredients in ultraprocessed foods \u2014 its second installment is expected to lay out proposed policy changes.

      "text": "The first report from the Trump administration\u2019s Make America Healthy Again Commission, released last week, appears to be rife with errors, including some studies that don\u2019t exist.\nTouted by US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as a milestone, the report lays out the government\u2019s priorities for addressing chronic health problems in children, which it ascribes to poor diet, lack of exercise, stress, overprescribing of drugs and exposure to environmental chemicals.\nThe sweeping 78-page document was produced in a little more than three months after it was ordered by President Donald Trump. It contained 522 references to studies, government reports and news articles. But some of these references were wrong or don\u2019t appear to exist. In other cases, studies in the report were misrepresented, according to the researchers who conducted them.\nThe citation errors were first reported by NOTUS, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news site created by former Politico Publisher Robert Allbritton.\nAn updated version of the report was posted online Thursday with some changes to the text and the works cited.\n\u201cMinor citation and formatting errors have been corrected, but the substance of the MAHA report remains the same \u2014 a historic and transformative assessment by the federal government to understand the chronic disease epidemic afflicting our nation\u2019s children,\u201d HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard said in a statement.\nNOTUS identified seven studies in the original report that didn\u2019t appear to exist.\nOne of them was credited to Dr. Katherine Keyes, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, and titled \u201cChanges in mental health and substance use among US adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d Keyes said she does study anxiety in teens, but she didn\u2019t author any study with that title.\n\u201cI can confirm that I, and my co-authors, did not write that paper. I was surprised to see what seems to be an error in the citation of my work in the report, and it does make me concerned given that citation practices are an important part of conducting and reporting rigorous science,\u201d she said in a statement.\nAlthough Keyes doesn\u2019t know where some of the percentages mentioned in the report came from, she says, she did recently publish a paper in the journal JAMA Network Open that came to roughly the same conclusions as what was in the text.\nDr. Robert Findling, chair of the Department of Psychiatry at Virginia Commonwealth University, said he also didn\u2019t write a study that was credited to him in the first version of the report, according to university spokesperson Michael Porter.\nThe study was used to suggest that pharmaceutical ads rely on vague symptom lists that overlap with normal teenage behaviors and could be driving overprescription of drugs to teens.\n\u201cDr. Findling did not author the article you cite and would not be able to address the report or its findings,\u201d Porter wrote in response to a question from CNN.\nThere\u2019s also no study by that name listed in the issue of the journal that was cited, The Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology, and no evidence of such a paper in PubMed, the database of medical studies maintained by the National Library of Medicine.\nThe reference citing Findling was removed from the updated report and the wording of the text it referred to changed to remove specific percentages.\nFootnote No. 520 in the original MAHA report references a study by Dr. Barbara Mintzes, a professor of evidence-based pharmaceutical policy at the University of Sydney.\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t found this article because I did not write it,\u201d she confirmed in an email to CNN. \u201cApologies that I cannot send a copy as it\u2019s an inaccurate reference.\u201d\nThe reference has changed in the updated report.\nTwo studies initially attributed to the journal Pediatrics also don\u2019t exist, according to Lisa Robinson, media relations manager for the American Academy of Pediatrics, which publishes the journal.\nThere was no record of a study with the title \u201cOverprescribing of Oral Corticosteroids for Children With Asthma.\u201d The journal had published a study called \u201cOral Corticosteroid Prescribing for Children With Asthma in a Medicaid Managed Care Program\u201d in 2017. It had the same first author as the study listed in the MAHA report but different co-authors.\nIn other cases, studies were attributed to the wrong journal or the wrong authors and sometimes even the wrong year.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the problems \u201cformatting issues.\u201d\n\u201cI understand there were some formatting issues with the MAHA report that are being addressed, and the report will be updated, but it does not negate the substance of the report, which, as you know, is one of the most transformative health reports that has ever been released by the federal government,\u201d Leavitt said in a briefing Thursday.\nDr. Ivan Oransky, a journalism professor at New York University who runs Retraction Watch, a website that tracks fraud and errors in medical publishing, said the nature of the discrepancies seems to indicate that they were generated by artificial intelligence.\n\u201cI\u2019m speculating here. I don\u2019t know this. The only people who would know that are the ones who actually created the paper,\u201d Oransky said, adding that an article by him and his coauthor on Retraction Watch, Adam Marcus, had been cited in a research paper submitted to the Australian government last year. However, the article didn\u2019t exist.\nLeavitt deferred questions about the use of AI in the report to HHS, which did not respond to CNN\u2019s questions about how the report was created.\nThe larger issue, as Oransky sees it, is that nobody caught these errors before the report was released.\n\u201cEither nobody checked this or nobody was looking very carefully at this before it was published,\u201d he said.\nTypically, official government reports go through layers of review, including critical reviews that question their conclusions, before they are released. This report doesn\u2019t seem to have followed that same kind of vetting process.\nThe citations in the report were \u201cmost likely an AI error\u201d and not a formatting error, said Dr. Art Caplan, a professor of bioethics and founding head of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU\u2019s Grossman School of Medicine.\n\u201cAI is not sophisticated enough to be trustworthy and accurate in surveying science, and that would appear to be what\u2019s going on here, which is unacceptable. It\u2019s the kind of thing that gets a senior researcher into deep trouble, potentially losing their funding. It\u2019s the kind of thing that leads to a student getting an F. It\u2019s inexcusable,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this is coming from people promising gold-standard science but delivering tin.\u201d\nThe errors came to light barely a week after Trump issued an executive order declaring that science has a reproducibility crisis \u2013 meaning scientists can\u2019t follow the methods of other scientists and come to the same conclusions \u2013 and promising to restore trust in the federal government\u2019s research.\nThe order pledges a return to \u201cGold Standard Science,\u201d promising \u201cthat Federal decisions are informed by the most credible, reliable, and impartial scientific evidence available.\u201d\nKennedy said on \u201cThe Ultimate Human\u201d podcast this week that the National Institutes of Health would devote about a fifth of its budget to \u201creplication\u201d and would stop publishing research in prominent peer-reviewed journals such as JAMA, the New England Journal of Medicine and the Lancet.\n\u201cWe are going to stop NIH scientists from publishing there,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to create our own journals in-house in each of the institutes.\n\u201cThey will become the preeminent journals.\u201d"

      "text": "Poor diet, environmental toxins, unhealthy habits and pharmaceuticals are contributing to a national rise in chronic illnesses, particularly among children, top Trump officials said in a Thursday report that lays the groundwork for a \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d overhaul of government policy.\nLeaders of the MAHA Commission including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will present their conclusions, which echo many of Kennedy\u2019s long held priorities, to President Donald Trump at a White House event Thursday afternoon.\nThe government panel is recommending that federal agencies reassess the nation\u2019s childhood vaccine schedule, scrutinize ultraprocessed foods, and study pesticides widely used in commercial farming.\nThe report is the first step of the administration\u2019s plan to address what President Trump has called a crisis of chronic disease in America. In a Feb. 13 executive order, Trump demanded an initial assessment of the potential drivers of chronic illnesses within 100 days; the commission is expected to deliver a strategy within the next 100 days.\nYet even before its release this week, farmers, food manufacturers, and some Republican lawmakers were raising concerns about the report\u2019s implications for the American food supply, particularly its call to reassess pesticides approved for use by the Environmental Protection Agency.\nAutism advocates and researchers have also railed against Kennedy\u2019s suggestions that rates of autism spectrum disorders are booming due to environmental and pharmaceutical factors. The report suggests links between autism and food dyes or environmental toxins, but does not discuss Kennedy\u2019s previous claims that there is a link between vaccines and autism.\nIt is also not clear how much the report\u2019s broad recommendations to launch studies on nutritious food, vaccines and environmental exposures will cost.\n\u201cThere is no budget,\u201d Kennedy told reporters in a Thursday briefing. \u201cAt this point, there\u2019s no concrete policy that could be funded in the budget; we\u2019re going to work out the policy recommendations over the next 100 days.\u201d\nBut, he added: \u201cWe\u2019re going to save a lot more money in the long run and even in the short run, if we can reduce the numbers, which we intend to do during this administration.\u201d\nVaccines and medicine\nThe MAHA commission calls for studies on the broad schedule of childhood vaccines, more research into potential adverse effects of vaccination, and \u201ctrue\u201d placebo studies of those childhood immunizations, echoing many of Kennedy\u2019s longtime rallying points around vaccine safety. The commission encourages \u201copen dialogue\u201d around risks and benefits of vaccines.\nWhile the report does not explicitly draw the disproven link between vaccination and autism, it notes that \u201cmany [parents] have concerns about the appropriate use of vaccines and their possible role in the growing childhood chronic disease crisis.\u201d\nAsked about subsequent studies on vaccines and autism, Kennedy told reporters that \u201cthe prescription comes in 100 days, how we\u2019re going to handle it, but we\u2019re already doing a lot of the research. We were not waiting for this report to come out to begin researching the crises, including the autism crisis.\u201d\nOfficials recommend expanding a new project, linking the National Institutes of Health with Medicare and Medicaid data, to examine environmental factors in childhood diseases. HHS originally launched the platform this month to study potential causes and economic impacts of autism.\nThe report also states that American children are overprescribed pharmaceuticals, including ADHD medicines, antidepressants, asthma and GLP-1 drugs, as a result of \u201cmisaligned incentives\u201d in the health care system. It cites research suggesting no clear benefit from antipsychotic antidepressant medicine in children.\nIt goes on to say that ADHD, depression and intellectual disabilities are diagnosed \u201cdisproportionately\u201d in young children, leading to \u201cunnecessary drugs, treatments, and social stigma.\u201d\nEnvironmental exposures\nThe commission\u2019s report flagged studies that suggest links between commonly used atrazine- and glyphosate-based weedkillers, such as RoundUp, and illnesses including reproductive disorders, cancer and liver complications. But it quickly also cited research from the Food and Drug Administration and the EPA that states the vast majority of food samples and farming practices are compliant with federal regulations.\nThe EPA has previously said these products are unlikely to cause cancer. But media reports that the MAHA commission would likely highlight widely used herbicides led agricultural groups and lawmakers representing agricultural areas to attempt to get ahead of the report.\n\u201cWe welcome efforts to improve health outcomes in America but recommendations to limit farming practices based on unproven theories could have severe unintended consequences,\u201d The American Farm Bureau Federation said in statement Tuesday, ahead of the report\u2019s release. \u201cHistory teaches us that it takes a very long time to rebuild public confidence once it is lost \u2013 even if the loss is caused by incorrect or incomplete information. This is certainly true when it comes to the food system.\u201d\nIn a statement to CNN, the National Corn Growers Association said it was deeply troubled by the report.\n\u201cDecades of extensive research and testing show that pesticides, including atrazine and glyphosate, can be applied safely for their intended uses,\u201d the association said. \u201cWe call on the administration to respect the existing body of science on pesticides and, moving forward, to include America\u2019s farmers in discussion as this process evolves.\u201d\nMississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith also raised this concern in a Senate Appropriations subcommittee hearing with Kennedy that day.\n\u201cIf Americans lose confidence in the safety and integrity of our food supply due to the unfound claims that mislead consumers, public health will be at risk,\u201d Hyde-Smith said.\nSecretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins told reporters Thursday that the report\u2019s questions are intended to improve agricultural technology, not destabilize American confidence in the food supply.\n\u201cDo all of us agree on everything? Of course not. But the place that we have landed, which I think all of us agree, is that this is not a binary choice between an industry, agriculture, and health,\u201d Rollins said. \u201cWhat I have been very encouraged by, [with] Secretary Kennedy, when we were in Texas together and our dozens and dozens of conversations, is that none of this will compromise the ability of our American agriculture to do what they do best, which is to feed the country and the world.\u201d\nFood and nutrition\nThe report states that children are consuming too many ultra-processed grains, sugars and fats, contributing to childhood obesity and diabetes rates. It also cites food additives including artificial sweeteners and preservatives, that some research suggests could be associated with chronic illnesses.\nThe commission recommends independent studies on food ingredients that are generally recognized as safe, and long-term NIH trials comparing ultraprocessed food diets to whole food regimens.\n\u201cI think everybody wants to prioritize the ultra processed food crisis and try to reduce our reliance\u201d on these foods, Kennedy told reporters on Thursday\nCorporate influence\nThe report also calls out industry lobbying and the \u201ccorporate capture\u201d of health agencies long lamented by Kennedy.\n\u201cEvidence suggests that pharmaceutical money strongly influences congressional legislation through lobbying and the manipulation of patient advocacy groups, and exerts considerable financial control over the FDA and its employees,\u201d it states, reflecting comments made by the health secretary to FDA employees last month.\nThe report goes on to detail lobbying efforts, advertising campaigns and scientific literature funding by pharmaceutical and food industries, laying the foundation for a crackdown that could be laid out in the commission\u2019s subsequent strategy report."

      "text": "MAHA, Farmers and Crop Protection Tools\nEPA Official: MAHA Report Will 'Respect Regulatory Frameworks' on Glyphosate\nTRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (DTN) -- The initial Make America Healthy Again Commission report said glyphosate and other pesticides may have a negative impact on children's health, but the upcoming MAHA report on recommendations for action will \"continue to respect regulatory frameworks\" that have found glyphosate is safe, a high-ranking Environmental Protection Agency official said here Tuesday at the American Sugar Alliance's International Sweetener Symposium.\nThe MAHA Commission is chaired by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has said for years that crop protection tools damage children's health. However, Nancy Beck, the EPA deputy administrator in the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Protection, noted that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins are members of the commission.\nThe cane and beet growers, who make up the American Sugar Alliance, and other farmers have been worried the MAHA Commission might recommend banning glyphosate or at least restricting its use.\nAs DTN has reported, farm groups this month are sending recommendations to the MAHA commission. The Food and Agriculture Climate Alliance (FACA), a coalition of 20 agricultural and conservation trade groups, on Thursday published a report of \"MAHA Policy Recommendations\" around soil health, conservation, forest management and agricultural innovation. The American Farm Bureau Federation issued a separate series of recommendations as well.\nEnvironmental groups and \"MAHA moms\" are also pressuring Kennedy and allies to follow up on campaign promises to limit exposure to chemicals in the food supply, including pesticides.\nBeck, a political appointee with long experience in government and the private sector, said that she could not share the contents of the report, which is expected to come out shortly, but \"we know pesticides are vital tools. We are going to get you those tools at the same time we protect children's health.\"\nFarm leaders criticized the first MAHA report for not including input from producers, but Beck noted that the White House held meetings with farm leaders prior to the writing of the second report.\nP[L1] D[0x0] M[300x250] OOP[F] ADUNIT[] T[]\n\"Your comments have been heard,\" Beck said.\nThe first report \"asked some very fair questions\" about what exposure to chemicals does to children's health.\nThe next report, she said, \"is very informed by stakeholder input\" and \"will cut across all agencies.\"\nBut Beck also noted that glyphosate is going through a re-registration process that is required every 15 years and that, based on a court decision, EPA is also doing a revised assessment on cancer risk.\n\"The science is still telling us that glyphosate is safe,\" Beck said, and EPA will continue to say that glyphosate is safe \"until the weight of scientific evidence shifts.\"\nThe rule on dicamba, a herbicide used to control broadleaf weeds, is out for public comment, with a goal to have labels \"agreed upon in the fall,\" she said.\nChlorpyrifos, an insecticide used to control pests such as termites, mosquitoes, and roundworms, is also under registration review, she said. The Biden administration withdrew all tolerances for it, but following a court decision, proposed a rule allowing 11 uses.\nThe Trump administration is also determined to bring new crop protection tools to the market faster and is reviewing potential changes to its role in enforcing the Endangered Species Act based on comments requested by the Biden administration, she said.\nEPA is undergoing reorganization, which \"brings about uncertainty,\" but her division, as required by statute, is adding 60 to 80 employees and will also use new tools such as artificial intelligence and bioinformatics, she said.\nOn both sugar and pesticides, Beck said, people talk about how bad they are but not about their benefits.\n\"There needs to be better education, outreach and understanding,\" Beck said.\nMAHA Commission report: https://www.whitehouse.gov/\u2026\nAlso see, \"Farm Groups Push to Shape MAHA Agenda, Warn of Risks to Crop Protection Tools,\" https://www.dtnpf.com/\u2026\nJerry Hagstrom can be reached at jhagstrom@nationaljournal.com\nFollow him on social platform X @hagstromreport\n(c) Copyright 2025 DTN, LLC.
