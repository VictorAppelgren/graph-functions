  "description": "The Duke of Sussex is said to be \u201cutterly devastated\u201d over what he sees as a \u201chostile takeover of his life\u2019s work.\u201d",
  "content": "Prince Harry has reportedly been left \u201craging\u201d in late-night phone calls over the latest probe findings into Sentebale, the charity he co-founded with Prince Seeiso of Lesotho.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex, 40, was forced to issue a response after the Charity Commission for England and Wales announced Tuesday that it discovered no evidence of \u201cwidespread or systemic bullying, harassment, misogyny or misogynoir\u201d at the organization.\n\nAs a result, the \u201cSpare\u201d author is said to be \u201cutterly devastated\u201d over what he sees as a \u201chostile takeover of his life\u2019s work,\u201d a source told the Daily Mail.\n\nInsiders told the outlet that Harry has been spending \u201chours\u201d on the phone with supporters late into the night over the fiasco.\n\nThe duke and his pals believe the African charity\u2019s current chair Dr. Sophie Chandauka \u201ccajoled her way to a position of power and influence.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the Invictus Games founder refuses to \u201ceven use her honorary title of doctor, such is the depth of their animosity,\u201d the outlet claims.\n\nHarry and his camp allegedly claim that Chandauka would rather the charity \u201cgo down in flames\u201d than resign from her post, per the outlet.\n\n\u201cShe shopped them all to the Charity Commission when the trustees raised their concerns about the charity\u2019s governance,\u201d an insider said.\n\nAnother source told the outlet that Harry had \u201cpersonally tried\u201d to mediate between Chandauka and the charity\u2019s trustees \u2014 and further offered to bring an independent law firm to help the situation.\n\nThe insider claims Harry said there is \u201cno way in hell\u201d he would ever work with Sentebale again, \u201cor at least not while Sophie Chandauka and her new stool pigeons [new trustees] were in place.\u201d\n\nAs the duke plots his next philanthropic move, sources claim that his approach will change if he decides to set up a new charity again.\n\nHe \u201cwould categorically not do it under the jurisdiction of the Charity Commission for England and Wales which he has no faith in and would go as far to say that he believes isn\u2019t fit for purpose,\u201d they said.\n\nFollow The Post\u2019s royal family live blog for the latest pics, news, exclusive details and more\n\nHowever, Harry\u2019s team has since refuted the claims, saying they are \u201ca distortion of the facts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t recognize the source of these quotes, it would be accurate to say that the Duke is, of course, deeply upset by this entire ordeal; though he remains absolutely committed to continuing the work he began 19 years ago \u2014 that being to support the children of Lesotho and Botswana living with HIV/AIDS and struggling with mental health issues,\u201d Harry\u2019s rep told The Post.\n\nOn Tuesday, the probe found no \u201coverreach\u201d by Harry or Chandauka, however, it criticized both parties for allowing the dispute \u201cto play out publicly.\u201d\n\nThe Commission pointed to poor internal governance at Sentebale and claimed that the duo\u2019s \u201cfailure to resolve disputes internally severely impacted the charity\u2019s reputation and risked undermining public trust in charities more generally.\u201d\n\nIn response, Harry\u2019s spokesperson said that it wasn\u2019t surprising the Commission found no evidence of wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cUnsurprisingly, the Commission makes no findings of wrongdoing in relation to Sentebale\u2019s Co-Founder and former Patron, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex,\u201d his rep said in a statement, per People.\n\n\u201cThey also found no evidence of widespread bullying, harassment or misogyny and misogynoir at the charity, as falsely claimed by the current Chair.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite all that, their report falls troublingly short in many regards, primarily the fact that the consequences of the current Chair\u2019s actions will not be borne by her \u2014 but by the children who rely on Sentebale\u2019s support,\u201d they added.\n\nPrince Harry and Prince Seeiso both resigned as patrons of Sentebale in March following Chandauka\u2019s shocking claims.",

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21.

      "text": "Regulator concludes case into Sentebale\nThe Charity Commission has concluded its compliance case into Sentebale, a charity which works with children and young people in Southern Africa.\nThe Commission has issued the charity with a Regulatory Action Plan to address governance weaknesses after a damaging internal dispute emerged.\nThe Commission has identified a lack of clarity around role descriptions and internal policies as the primary cause for weaknesses in the charity\u2019s management. It finds that this confusion exacerbated tensions, which culminated in a dispute and multiple resignations of trustees and both founding patrons.\nThe regulator has criticised all parties to the dispute for allowing it to play out publicly, and further concluded that the then trustees\u2019 failure to resolve disputes internally severely impacted the charity\u2019s reputation and risked undermining public trust in charities more generally.\nBackground\nIn 2023, Sentebale\u2019s then trustees sought to implement a new fundraising strategy in the United States. In the period that followed, a serious dispute within the charity emerged between the charity\u2019s chair of trustees, Dr Sophie Chandauka, some of the other trustees of the charity, and one of its patrons, the Duke of Sussex.\nConcerns about relationships breaking down were first raised with the Charity Commission in February 2025. After a period of assessing the concerns raised, the Commission opened a regulatory compliance case in April 2025.\nThe purpose of the Commission\u2019s case has been to determine whether the charity\u2019s current and former trustees, including its chair, have fulfilled their duties and responsibilities under charity law. The Commission\u2019s role as regulator is not to adjudicate or mediate internal disputes in charities.\nFindings\nA number of concerns were raised by different parties. After conducting interviews and thoroughly reviewing all evidence submitted, the Commission found:\n- the delegation of certain powers to the chair, including consideration of an \u2018executive chair\u2019 role, was a confusing, convoluted and poorly governed process, with a lack of clearly defined delegations over time\n- the then trustees failed to have proper processes and policies in place to investigate internal complaints\n- more generally, a lack of clear policies contributed to the failure to resolve disputes.\n- it was not satisfied that public statements made to the media and public criticism made in television interviews, were conducted in a way that served the charity\u2019s best interests\nBased on the evidence provided and reviewed by the Commission, it found no evidence of:\n- widespread or systemic bullying or harassment, including misogyny or misogynoir at the charity, but the Commission has acknowledged the strong perception of ill treatment felt by a number of parties to the dispute and the impact this may have had on them personally\n- \u2018over-reach\u2019 by either the chair or the Duke of Sussex as patron, but the Commission is critical of the charity\u2019s lack of clarity in delegations to the chair which allowed for misunderstandings to occur\nThe failure to clarify delegations within the charity to the chair, and the failure to have proper processes for internal complaints, both amount to mismanagement in the administration of the charity.\nSeparately, the Commission expects that in future, the charity should have a clearly defined patron role set out in writing.\nConclusions\nThe Commission\u2019s assessment of the various accounts that have been provided is that all the charity\u2019s then trustees contributed to a missed opportunity to resolve issues which led to the dispute. The regulator observed that strategic and financial difficulties that had emerged for the charity following the Covid-19 pandemic contributed to the tensions that arose.\nThe regulator urges trustees of all charities, if in disagreement, not to lose sight of their charity\u2019s best interests or the good work it does for those who need it.\nAs made clear to all parties in this case, if disputes do occur, the regulator recommends seeking mediation, showing good will and acting in good faith. It also encourages all trustees to be mindful to channel their belief in the charity\u2019s mission in a constructive and collaborative way.\nNext steps\nThe charity currently has validly appointed trustees in place to take the charity forward. The Commission has issued a Regulatory Action Plan setting out steps the current trustees need to take, including to implement an internal dispute policy, improve the charity\u2019s complaints and whistleblowing procedures, and establish clearer processes for delegating authority on behalf of the charity. The Regulatory Action Plan also sets out the importance of the trustees securing sufficient funding to enable the charity to deliver for its beneficiaries.\nThe regulator is monitoring the charity\u2019s progress against the Regulatory Action Plan. Should it receive evidence that raises new regulatory concerns, it will assess this in line with its usual process.\nDavid Holdsworth, Chief Executive of the Charity Commission, said:\nPassion for a cause is the bedrock of volunteering and charity, delivering positive impact for millions of people here at home and abroad every day. However, in the rare cases when things go wrong, it is often because that very passion has become a weakness rather than a strength.\nSentebale\u2019s problems played out in the public eye, enabling a damaging dispute to harm the charity\u2019s reputation, risk overshadowing its many achievements, and jeopardising the charity\u2019s ability to deliver for the very beneficiaries it was created to serve.\nThis case highlights what can happen when there are gaps in governance and policies critical to charities\u2019 ability to deliver for their cause. As a result, we have issued the charity a Regulatory Action Plan to make needed improvements and rectify findings of mismanagement.\nHe added:\nMoving forward I urge all parties not to lose sight of those who rely on the charity\u2019s services. The current trustees must now make improvements and ensure the charity focuses on delivering for those it exists to serve.\nNotes to editors:\n- The Charity Commission is the independent, non-ministerial government department that registers and regulates charities in England and Wales. Its ambition is to be an expert regulator that is fair, balanced, and independent so that charity can thrive. This ambition will help to create and sustain an environment where charities further build public trust and ultimately fulfil their essential role in enhancing lives and strengthening society.

      "text": "Harry's late-night calls over Sentebale charity crisis. Devastated Prince's rants of 'hostile takeover' of 'life's work' and the new British target of his rage revealed by REBECCA ENGLISH\nWhen I first visited Lesotho with Prince Harry soon after the inception of his Sentebale charity in 2006, the young royal couldn\u2019t hold back his excitement at what he hoped to achieve.\nHaving set it up in memory of his late mother Princess Diana (sentebale means \u2018forget-me-not\u2019 in Lesotho\u2019s language), Harry\u2019s pride that he had managed to get this deeply personal project off the ground was clear to see. It was difficult not to be won over by his passion.\nShowing myself and a group of other journalists around a dusty, rubble-strewn piece of wasteland that was to become Sentebale\u2019s first centre for children impacted by HIV and Aids, Harry repeatedly asked me: \u2018Do your editors get what I am trying to do here? Do they understand?\u2019\nIt was one of the earliest examples of how the self-dubbed \u2018spare\u2019 was intent on doing things his own way rather than following the royal tradition of taking on patronages of well-established charitable organisations.\nBut, as the Charity Commission warned, while \u2018passion for a cause\u2019 is the bedrock of what keeps the sector going, when things go wrong it is often because that passion has become \u2018a weakness rather than a strength\u2019.\nPrince Harry, Meghan and Sophie Chandauka pictured at a polo match benefitting Sentebale in April 2024\nWhen Harry launched Sentebale in 2006, pictured on the launch visit, his pride that he had managed to get this deeply personal project off the ground was clear to see\nIndeed, that seems to have been the tragic case with Sentebale after a very public row over its governance exploded in March.\nAt the time, the Duke of Sussex and a number of trustees (many of whom, including his \u2018second father\u2019 Mark Dyer, are his close friends) resigned after a dispute with the organisation\u2019s chair, Sophie Chandauka.\nShe fired back, accusing Harry of presiding over a culture of racism, misogyny, \u2018misogynoir\u2019 (sexism faced by black women) and bullying \u2018at scale\u2019 in a TV interview.\nThe Charity Commission said it had found \u2018no evidence\u2019 to support her allegations in an investigation. But both sides were criticised for letting the \u2018damaging\u2019 boardroom battle play out in the \u2018public eye\u2019.\nIf that was supposed to clear things up, it\u2019s done anything but. The former board of trustees issued a stinging statement, saying the watchdog had \u2018chosen to ignore key concerns and irrefutable evidence\u2019.\nMeanwhile, Sentebale suggested it may yet take further action \u2013 pointing out that the watchdog had admitted it did not have the power to investigate specific allegations of bullying or misogyny against individuals.\nThe saga has now resulted in such bitterness between the two camps that many \u2013 including the prince himself \u2013 are privately predicting that the charity will not survive the fall-out.\nHarry, I am told, is \u2018utterly devastated\u2019, spending hours on the phone from California to supporters late into the night telling them about a \u2018hostile takeover\u2019 of his \u2018life\u2019s work\u2019.\nBut many \u2013 including Prince Harry \u2013 are privately predicting that the charity will not survive the fall-out. Prince Harry with Sentebale co-founder Prince Seeiso in Lesotho in 2015\nThe prince and his friends believe \u2018Ms\u2019 Chandauka \u2013 they won\u2019t even use her honorary title of doctor, such is the depth of their animosity \u2013 cajoled her way to a position of power and influence.\nThey claim she would rather see the charity \u2018go down in flames\u2019 than admit she is guilty of mismanagement and resign. \u2018She shopped them all to the Charity Commission when the trustees raised their concerns about the charity\u2019s governance,\u2019 alleges a source.\nThey say that Harry had personally tried to mediate between her and the trustees, and when that was rejected even offered to bring an independent firm of lawyers to help. They also allege that Harry was not given the opportunity to submit a statement to the watchdog\u2019s inquiry, despite the very personal nature of the claims made against him.\nOne source close to the prince told me there was \u2018no way in hell\u2019 he would ever work with Sentebale again \u2013 \u2018or at least not while Sophie Chandauka and her new stool pigeons [new trustees] were in place\u2019.\nWhat\u2019s more, while the prince is weighing up his options over what to do next, they said if he were to set up a charity again he \u2018would categorically not do it under the jurisdiction of the Charity Commission for England and Wales which he has no faith in and would go as far to say that he believes isn\u2019t fit for purpose\u2019.\nThe commission, let us remind ourselves, is the Government\u2019s independent regulatory body \u2013 and we all know, after his decisive loss in the Court of Appeal over his UK security arrangements earlier this year, what he thinks of such official bodies. Another \u2018establishment stitch-up\u2019, no doubt.\nOf course, the eloquent Dr Chandauka, a Zimbabwean-born lawyer, offers a very different version. Recollections, to quote a now well-worn phrase, really do vary. Back in March, she said she took on the role of chair after serving as a charity trustee with the best of intentions and seemingly felt that the charity, regardless of the good intention at its inception, had become a personal \u2018fiefdom\u2019 for Harry and his pals.\nMany charitable organisations, particularly in developing areas of the world, have been struggling practically and financially, particularly as a result of the Covid pandemic.\nShe said she wanted to make Sentebale\u2019s work and governance more Africa-centric, and develop professionally-driven sources of funding rather than the occasional charitable polo match organised by the former royal and his mates \u2013 such as the awkward 2024 event where Dr Chandauka was asked to move around Harry and Meghan on the podium.\nSentebale\u2019s chair went where many have feared to tread in her accusations \u2013 adding that his public image was so toxic after his acrimonious departure from the Royal Family that it was actively putting off donors and supporters.\nThe prince and his friends believe Ms Chandauka cajoled her way to a position of power and influence, writes Rebecca English\nShe said Sentebale needed to make clear, for its very survival, that it was not just an extension of his private endeavours.\nSources I have spoken to in recent days say she is traumatised by what has happened and has been working desperately hard to \u2018support\u2019 the charity.\nThey point out that it was Team Harry who fired the first public salvo, speaking to The Times back in March to put out their version of events. Dr Chandauka, they say, was only reacting to that broadside when she went on television herself.\nRegardless of whose side you\u2019re on, there\u2019s no doubt many who have taken an interest in the crisis feel a frisson of pleasure at seeing Harry being given a taste of his own medicine.\nThe biter has become the bit, forced to deal with the same sort of accusations he has thrown at his own family over the past few years.\nAnd the prince has learnt to his cost, such slurs are powerful for a reason. This stuff sticks. Sentebale needs to file its public accounts by the end of August and many on Harry\u2019s side openly predict they are likely to show it has financially \u2018tanked\u2019.\nOnly time will tell but, if true, there are no winners in that. Not Harry, and certainly not the charity that works to help some of the poorest and most disadvantaged young people in the world.\nIt\u2019s difficult to shake the feeling that when it comes to the Duke of Sussex, however admirable his intentions, a trail of toxicity is always left in his wake.\nAs someone determined to create a legacy as a global philanthropist, how on earth is he to come back from that?"

The Who to me is very perplexing.\u201d\nHowever, the \u201cPinball Wizard\u201d crooner also acknowledged that his \u201cvoice is still as good as ever,\u201d even after performing for over six decades.\n\u201cI\u2019m still singing in the same keys, and it\u2019s still bloody loud, but I can\u2019t tell you if it will still be there in October,\u201d he shared. \u201cThere\u2019s a big part of me that\u2019s going: I just hope I make it through.\u201d\nDaltrey, who formed The Who alongside guitarist Pete Townshend, bassist John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon in 1964, previously fell ill with a serious case of meningitis back in 2015.\nHe said that he still feels the after-effects, and added that the virus had done \u201ca lot of damage.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s buggered up my internal thermometer, so every time I start singing in any climate over 75 degrees, I\u2019m wringing with sweat, which drains my body salts,\u201d the \u201cWon\u2019t Get Fooled Again\u201d singer shared.\n\u201cThe potential to get really ill is there, and I have to be honest, I\u2019m nervous about making it to the end of the tour,\u201d he concluded.\nDaltrey reflected on his life during another chat with The Times published last year.\nAfter sharing that all his \u201cdreams came true,\u201d the rock legend said that he is now \u201cready to go at any time.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be realistic,\u201d he explained. \u201cYou can\u2019t live your life forever. Like I said, people my age, we\u2019re in the way. There are no guitar strings to be changed on this old instrument.\u201d\nMore recently, Daltrey joked about going deaf and blind in his old age, much like the blind, deaf and mute main character of The Who\u2019s 1969 album and rock opera \u201cTommy.\u201d\n\u201cThe joys of getting old mean you go deaf. I also now have got the joy of going blind,\u201d he told the crowd at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall during a concert in March.\n\u201cFortunately, I still have my voice,\u201d he joked, \u201cbecause then I\u2019ll have a full Tommy.\u201d\nThe Who\u2019s farewell tour is set to kick off in Florida on Aug. 16, and wrap up in Las Vegas on Sept. 28.\nDaltrey and Townshend, 80, announced their final tour back in May as Moon died in 1978 from a drug overdose, and Entwistle passed away in 2002 after suffering a heart attack triggered by cocaine.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy to end the big part of my life that touring with The Who has been,\u201d Daltrey said at the time. \u201cThanks for being there for us and look forward to seeing you one last time.\u201d\n\u201cWell, all good things must come to an end,\u201d Townshend added. \u201cIt is a poignant time.\u201d\n\u201cRoger and I are in a good place, despite our age, eager to throw our weight behind this fond farewell to all our faithful fans, and hopefully to new ones who might jump in to see what they have been missing for the last 57 years,\u201d the iconic guitarist added.\n\u201cThis tour will be about fond memories, love and laughter,\u201d Townshend concluded. \u201cMake sure you join in.\u201d"

issued a scathing response after the Charity Commission for England and Wales announced Tuesday that it discovered no evidence of \u201cwidespread or systemic bullying, harassment, misogyny or misogynoir\u201d at the Sentebale charity founded by Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho.\nAlthough the Commission also announced that it found no \u201coverreach\u201d by Harry or the African charity\u2019s current chair, Dr. Sophie Chandauka, it criticized both parties for allowing the dispute \u201cto play out publicly.\u201d\nThe Commission pointed to poor internal governance at Sentebale and claimed that both Prince Harry and Chandauka\u2019s \u201cfailure to resolve disputes internally severely impacted the charity\u2019s reputation and risked undermining public trust in charities more generally.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex said that it wasn\u2019t surprising the Commission found no evidence of wrongdoing.\n\u201cUnsurprisingly, the Commission makes no findings of wrongdoing in relation to Sentebale\u2019s Co-Founder and former Patron, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex,\u201d his rep began in a statement, per People. \u201cThey also found no evidence of widespread bullying, harassment or misogyny and misogynoir at the charity, as falsely claimed by the current Chair.\u201d\n\u201cDespite all that, their report falls troublingly short in many regards, primarily the fact that the consequences of the current Chair\u2019s actions will not be borne by her \u2014 but by the children who rely on Sentebale\u2019s support,\u201d they added.\nMeanwhile, an insider close to the Duke of Sussex told the outlet that neither Prince Harry nor Prince Seeiso can envision a return to Sentebale if Chandauka remains the charity\u2019s chair.\nPrince Harry and Prince Seeiso both resigned as patrons of Sentebale in March following Chandauka\u2019s shocking claims.\n\u201cBoth Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso are devastated by what has effectively been a hostile takeover by Sophie Chandauka,\u201d the source said.\n\u201cThis was Prince Seeiso and Prince Harry\u2019s life work,\u201d the insider continued. \u201cThey established it 19 years ago and in that time put in blood, sweat and tears and their own money into building this charity up to what it was: a multi-million pound charity that delivered nothing but good for the beneficiary community that is supported in Lesotho and Botswana.\u201d\nAs for Chandauka, she thanked the Commission and claimed that its findings \u201cconfirmed\u201d her allegations.\n\u201cI appreciate the Charity Commission for its conclusions, which confirm the governance concerns I raised privately in February 2025,\u201d Chandauka said in a statement. \u201cThe experience was intense, and it became a test of our strategic clarity and operational resilience.\u201d\n\u201cI thank every dedicated colleague and the courageous new Board members who have stayed focused on the mission in the face of unprecedented media glare,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe unexpected adverse media campaign that was launched by those who resigned on 24 March 2025 has caused incalculable damage and offers a glimpse of the unacceptable behaviors displayed in private.\u201d\n\u201cWe are emerging not just grateful to have survived, but stronger: more focused, better governed, boldly ambitious and with our dignity intact,\u201d Chandauka added.\nThe Sentebale scandal kicked off in March when Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso, who co-founded the charity in 2006 to help AIDS patients in Africa, announced that they were stepping down from their roles as patrons and trustees due to infighting within the organization.\nSentebale\u2019s other board of trustee members resigned shortly after, and when Chandauka was asked to step down, she sued to remain in her role as chair.\nChandauka also alleged that the conflict began when Prince Harry\u2019s team asked her to defend his wife, Meghan Markle, 44, from negative media coverage connected to an awkward photo op at a Sentebale event in April 2024.\n\u201cI said no, we\u2019re not setting a precedent by which we become an extension of

concerns raised\u201d about Sentebale by Chandauka.\nDespite the scandal and controversy, an insider told People that Prince Harry is still \u201cabsolutely dedicated to supporting the children of Lesotho and Botswana.\u201d\n\u201cHow that happens, he will keep his options open,\u201d the source said. \u201cWhether that means raising money for pre-existing charities that are doing good work in those countries or establishing something independent and new.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m positive that Prince Harry would want to work with Prince Seeiso again and deliver for Lesotho,\u201d they added.\nHowever, the Commission only investigated allegations regarding Sentebale and did not clear Prince Harry of any alleged wrongdoing in connection with Chandauka\u2019s claims against him.\n\u201cIt provides Sentebale with some degree of reassurance that the Charity Commission has not identified widespread bullying within the charity, but the Commission has acknowledged the strong

Credit : Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty NEED TO KNOW The Charity Commission for England and Wales has released the results of a probe into Sentebale, the charity founded by Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso of LesothoThe Charity Commission found no evidence of \"widespread or systemic bullying or harassment, including misogyny or misogynoir at the charity\" or \" 'over-reach' by either the chair or the Duke of Sussex as patron\"However, a source tells PEOPLE that Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso see no way back to the charity while Chandauka remains chair Prince Harry is speaking out following the conclusion of an investigation into the nonprofit he co-founded nearly two decades ago alongside Prince Seeiso of Lesotho \u2014 and says that despite the absence of any finding that he engaged in wrongdoing, the damage is already done. On Aug. 5, the Charity Commission for England and Wales announced it found no evidence of \u201cwidespread or systemic bullying, harassment, misogyny or misogynoir\u201d at Sentebale, following an investigation into claims made by the charity\u2019s current chair, Dr. Sophie Chandauka. The Commission also found no \"overreach\" by either Chandauka or Prince Harry, 40, who stepped down as Sentebale\u2019s patron in March following what he described as a breakdown in leadership. However, the Commission criticized all sides for allowing the conflict \"to play out publicly\" and cited poor internal governance and a \"failure to resolve disputes internally severely impacted the charity\u2019s reputation and risked undermining public trust in charities more generally.\" Prince Harry and Dr. Sophie Chandauka speak at a panel in Miami Beach, Florida on April 11, 2024. Jason Koerner/Getty Our new app is here! Free, fun and full of exclusives. Scan to download now! In a statement responding to the findings, a spokesperson for Prince Harry said, \"Unsurprisingly, the Commission makes no findings of wrongdoing in relation to Sentebale\u2019s Co-Founder and former Patron, Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex. They also found no evidence of widespread bullying, harassment or misogyny and misogynoir at the charity, as falsely claimed by the current Chair.\" \"Despite all that, their report falls troublingly short in many regards, primarily the fact that the consequences of the current Chair\u2019s actions will not be borne by her \u2014 but by the children who rely on Sentebale\u2019s support,\" the spokesperson continued. A source tells PEOPLE that Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso see no way back to the charity while Chanduka is in place, but that they are keeping their options open. \u201cBoth Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso are devastated by what has effectively been a hostile takeover by Sophie Chandauka,\" the source close to the former trustees and patrons says. \"This was Prince Seeiso and Prince Harry\u2019s life work. They established it 19 years ago and in that time put in blood, sweat and tears and their own money into building this charity up to what it was: a multi-million pound charity that delivered nothing but good for the beneficiary community that is supported in Lesotho and Botswana.\u201d Prince Seeiso and Prince Harry in Maseru, Lesotho on Oct. 1, 2024. Brian Otieno/Getty In a separate statement, Sentebale\u2019s former trustees expressed disappointment in the Commission\u2019s findings, saying key issues they raised about the charity\u2019s leadership had been overlooked. \"We are disheartened by the way in which the Charity Commission has chosen to ignore key concerns and irrefutable evidence raised with them regarding the leadership and oversight of Sentebale's Chair,\" the statement read. \"We accept there is always room to strengthen governance of an organisation, which is why we welcomed a governance review by the Chair initiated in February 2024, and that should have only taken a matter of months \u2014 we unfortunately never saw a report or any outcomes enacted, more than two years into her tenure.\" \"We remain gravely concerned for the future of the charity and the wellbeing of the communities we served for 19 years, following the mission set out by Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso in honour of their mothers,\" the statement concluded. Prince Harry dances with children at the opening of Sentebale's Mamohato Children's Centre during an official visit to Africa on November 26, 2015 in Maseru, Lesotho. Samir Hussein/WireImage Sentebale\u2019s current board said it accepted the Charity Commission\u2019s findings and committed to carrying out the regulator\u2019s recommendations. In a statement, the organization said it supported the Commission\u2019s Regulatory Action Plan issued to address their internal dispute policy, improve the charity\u2019s complaints and whistleblowing procedures and establish clearer processes for delegating authority. The Commission will monitor progress in the Action Plan, which includes timescales. Sentebale noted, however, that \u201cthe Commission has not investigated any individual allegations and therefore has not made any findings in relation to individuals, including Prince Harry. The issues not investigated by the Commission can and may be dealt with through avenues more appropriate than the Commission.\u201d Chandauka said, \u201cI appreciate the Charity Commission for its conclusions, which confirm the governance concerns I raised privately in February 2025. The experience was intense, and it became a test of our strategic clarity and operational resilience.\" Saying that Sentebale has continued to support young people in Lesotho and Botswana, Chandauka added, \"I thank every dedicated colleague and the courageous new Board members who have stayed focused on the mission in the face of unprecedented media glare. The unexpected adverse media campaign that was launched by those who resigned on 24 March 2025 has caused incalculable damage and offers a glimpse of the unacceptable behaviors displayed in private. We are emerging not just grateful to have survived, but stronger: more focused, better governed, boldly ambitious and with our dignity intact.\" \"Despite the recent turbulence, we will always be inspired by the vision of our Founders, Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso, who established Sentebale in memory of their precious mothers, Princess Diana and Queen \u2018Mamohato,\" she added. \"To all who believe in our mission: please walk with us as Sentebale recovers, renews, and rises to meet the hopes and expectations of the next generation.\" A source close to the former trustees found it \"appalling\" that Chandauka invoked the name of the founders and their late mothers in her statement \"for her own good.\" The purpose of the Charity Commission\u2019s investigation was to determine whether the charity\u2019s current and former trustees, as well as its chair, fulfilled their duties and responsibilities under charity law. However, their role is not to adjudicate or mediate internal disputes.

The exit stemmed from a breakdown in relations between Sentebale's chair, Chandauka, and board of trustees members, who also stepped down. On March 27, Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso said in a joint statement, \"With heavy hearts, we have resigned from our roles as Patrons of the organisation until further notice, in support of and solidarity with the board of trustees who have had to do the same. It is devastating that the relationship between the charity\u2019s trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation.\" The princes said that Sentebale's trustees asked Chandauka to step down, and she sued to remain chair. Harry and Seeiso, 59, said they were \"truly heartbroken\" that the trustees felt forced to step down and added, \"What\u2019s transpired is unthinkable. We are in shock that we have to do this, but we have a continued responsibility to Sentebale\u2019s beneficiaries, so we will be sharing all of our concerns with the Charity Commission as to how this came about. \" Chandauka spoke out in several interviews to share her side of the story, painting a different picture of the events that led to this point. In a March 29 interview with the Financial Times, the Zimbabwean corporate finance lawyer said her relationship with Prince Harry took a turn after she refused his team's request to defend his wife, Meghan Markle, after an awkward photo moment between them at a Sentebale event in April 2024 led to negative media coverage.

Alamy According to Chandauka, the Duke of Sussex urged her to publicly address the incident that unfolded during the trophy presentation ceremony at the Royal Salute Polo Challenge in Florida, but she refused. \"I said no, we\u2019re not setting a precedent by which we become an extension of the Sussex PR machine,\" Chandauka said. A source close to Sentebale patrons and trustees told PEOPLE that the dispute at the crux of the controversy is rooted in governance concerns, not personal grievances. Chandauka was named Sentebale's chair in July 2023 after serving on its board from 2009 to 2015. A Sentebale source familiar with the situation told PEOPLE at the time that the organization was in stable financial standing when she became chair, but the situation changed under her leadership.

Though the Charity Commission\u2019s findings bring some closure, they also underscore just how much damage has been done, both to the charity\u2019s public image and its founding partnership. Regardless, the source tells PEOPLE that Prince Harry remains \"absolutely dedicated to supporting the children of Lesotho and Botswana.\" \"How that happens, he will keep his options open. Whether that means raising money for pre-existing charities that are doing good work in those countries or establishing something independent and new,\" the source says. \"It is very early days.\" The source adds, \u201cI\u2019m positive that Prince Harry would want to work with Prince Seeiso again and deliver for Lesotho.\u201d Close Leave a Comment Read more: Royals British Royal Family British Royal Family News"

The Duke also demanded the charity share a public message of support for his wife, Meghan Markle, after a polo fundraiser she organized \u201cwent badly,\u201d she alleged.\n\u201cI said I wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Chanduaka went on. \u201cNot because I didn\u2019t care about the duchess, but because I knew what would happen if I did so, number one. And number two, because we cannot be an extension of the Sussexes.\u201d\nAsked if Prince Harry was the \u201cnumber one risk\u201d to the charity, she replied \u201cyes.\u201d She added that many of the charity\u2019s sponsors had walked away around the same time the Sussexes left the UK.\nWhen she asked why, she was told that it was \u201can uncomfortable conversation to have with Prince Harry in the room.\u201d\nChandauka \u2014 who has been chairwoman of Sentebale since 2023 \u2014 also accused Prince Harry and co-founder Prince Seeiso of trying to \u201cforce a failure\u201d at the charity in a separate interview.\nThe princes \u201cwant to force a failure and then come to the rescue,\u201d she alleged in the interview with the Financial Times.\n\u201cThe number one risk for this organization was the toxicity of its lead patron\u2019s brand,\u201d she went on.\nHer remarks marked the first time she had broken her silence following the joint statement from Princes Harry and Seeiso on Tuesday, accusing her of creating an \u201cuntenable situation\u201d at the charity \u2014 whose name means \u201cforget me not.\u201d\n\u201cThe relationship between the charity\u2019s trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation,\u201d the statement read.\n\u201cThese trustees acted in the best interest of the charity in asking the chair to step down, while keeping the wellbeing of staff in mind. In turn, she sued the charity to remain in this voluntary position, further underscoring the broken relationship.\u201d\nThe UK Charity Commission, a government body which registers and regulates charities, is examining the fallout.\n\u201cWe can confirm that we are aware of concerns about the governance of Sentebale,\u201d a Charity Commission spokesperson told The Post. \u201cWe are assessing the issues to determine the appropriate regulatory steps.\u201d"

The charity helps disadvantaged children.\nThe charity\u2019s former trustees Timothy Boucher, Mark Dyer, Audrey Kgosidintsi, Kelello Lerotholi and Damian West have since released a statement outlining their decision to unanimously resign as board members.\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision is nothing short of devastating for all of us, but we see no other path forward as the result of our loss in trust and confidence in the chair of the board,\u201d they said.\nIn response, Chandauka issued a statement of her own, saying she refuses to be intimidated by the shocking departures.\n\u201cFor me, this is not a vanity project from which I can resign when I am called to account,\u201d she said, adding that she has reported the trustees to the Charity Commission.\n\u201cThere are people in this world who behave as though they are above the law and mistreat people, and then play the victim card and use the very press they disdain to harm people who have the courage to challenge their conduct.\u201d\nChandauka said the situation transpired after she \u201cdared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir \u2014 and the cover-up that ensued.\u201d\nFor its part, the Charity Commission told BBC News it was \u201caware of concerns about the governance\u201d of Prince Harry\u2019s charity.\n\u201cWe are assessing the issues to determine the appropriate regulatory steps,\u201d the commission said.\nThe Post has reached out to Harry\u2019s reps for comment.\nHarry\u2019s stunning departure comes just months after Richard Miller stepped down from his post as Sentebale\u2019s CEO after five years.\nMiller\u2019s resignation came weeks after Andrew Tucker, who had been with the charity in a senior position for 10 years, and Baroness Lynda Chalker, a director for 18 years, quit the organization.\nThe charity underwent a major change after advertising guru Johnny Hornby quit last year. He served as a trustee for 11 years at the organization, spending five as chairman."

  "argos_summary": "Prince Harry is reportedly furious over the Charity Commission's findings regarding Sentebale, the charity he co-founded, which found no evidence of systemic bullying or harassment but criticized both him and the current chair, Dr. Sophie Chandauka, for allowing internal disputes to become public. Following the investigation, Harry expressed devastation over what he perceives as a 'hostile takeover' of his life's work, leading him and Prince Seeiso to resign as patrons. The fallout has raised concerns about the charity's future, with insiders suggesting that Harry may not return to Sentebale as long as Chandauka remains in her position.",
