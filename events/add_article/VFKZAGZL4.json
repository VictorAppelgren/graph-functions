      "summary": "President Trump announced that the U.S. government has secured a 10% stake in Intel by converting $11.1 billion of CHIPS Act funds into 433.3 million non‑voting shares, giving the government a paper gain of about $1.9 billion. The move, made while Intel is cutting 20,000 jobs and struggling under CEO Lip‑Bu Tan, has drawn criticism for blurring public‑private lines and potentially giving the administration leverage over a major tech company. Trump’s action follows a broader push to keep chip manufacturing in the U.S., including a 15% revenue‑sharing deal with Nvidia and AMD for sales to China, and contrasts with past government bailouts such as the 2009 GM rescue. The deal has sparked debate over the appropriateness of government equity holdings in private firms and the risks of political influence on corporate strategy.",
