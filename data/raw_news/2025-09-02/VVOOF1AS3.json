  "content": "\u2022 Stephan Crokaert, formerly of NeoMedLight, Abbott, Adagio and Boston Scientific, brings more than 35 years of strategic and commercial experience in life sciences\n\u2022 Allegro prepares to advance lead product hydrocelin into clinical trials in 2026\n\nLiege, Belgium \u2013 3 September 2025 (08:30) \u2013 Allegro NV, a biomedical company developing transformative nanotechnology-based treatments for degenerative joint disease, has appointed Stephan Crokaert into the role of Chief Operating Officer as of this month. The new position strengthens the company\u2019s management team and sharpens Allegro\u2019s focus on the clinical and commercial development of hydrocelin, which has the potential to become a first-in-class disease-modifying, minimally invasive, injectable treatment for osteoarthritis.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased to welcome such an experienced life science professional as Stephan Crokaert to the management team. Stephan\u2019s appointment comes at a crucial moment for Allegro, as we prepare our potential first-in-class treatment for osteoarthritis, hydrocelin, for clinical trials,\u201d said Lucas Decuypere, CEO at Allegro. \u201cOsteoarthritis is a serious disease that can lead to social isolation and mental health problems. We aim to give freedom of mobility back to the hundreds of millions of people around the world suffering from osteoarthritis.\u201d\n\nMr Crokaert brings more than 35 years of experience in life sciences, with a focus on medical devices. Most recently, he served as Global Sales and Market Director at medical device start-up NeoMedLight, where he was integral in the establishment and delivery of a global commercial network. Prior to that, he served in senior leadership roles at Abbott and Adagio.\n\n\u201cI am delighted to join the driven and successful team at Allegro. I\u2019m looking forward to using the experience I built up over a career spanning 30 years in international leadership roles to advance the company\u2019s promising technology and bring an innovative first-in-class treatment for osteoarthritis to market, with the potential to help millions of patients,\u201d said Stephan Crokaert, Chief Operating Officer at Allegro.\n\nIn July, Allegro successfully raised \u20ac2 million in new funding, showing the strong commitment of core investors. Allegro will use the proceeds to prepare hydrocelin for a feasibility study in patients with osteoarthritis in 2026, which will be followed by a global registrational trial. In August, the company completed the installation of a manufacturing device in a cleanroom at its own facilities, which is scalable to up to 15,000 prefilled syringes per batch.",
