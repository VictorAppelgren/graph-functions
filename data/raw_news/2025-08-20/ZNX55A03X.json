  "description": "Zohran Mamdani, New York City's Democratic mayoral candidate, addressed President Donald Trump's \"communist\" label by citing Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and highlighting affordability.",
  "content": "New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani dodged a question about President Donald Trump labeling him a \"communist\" when pressed by Fox News' Nate Foy on Wednesday.\n\nReferencing a Fox News Digital report, in which his supporters dismissed Mamdani's \"communist\" label, Foy asked the self-described democratic socialist if the distinction between communism and socialism matters.\n\n\"Are there elements of communism in your platform?\" Foy asked.\n\n\"The elements of my platform are all about affordability, and I am a democratic socialist,\" Mamdani said. \"When New Yorkers ask me what it means, I take them to the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, who said, 'Call it democracy or call it democratic socialism, there must be a better distribution of wealth for all of God's children in this country.'\"\n\nSince Mamdani's primary upset earlier this summer, the Democratic mayoral nominee has been by Trump.\n\nZOHRAN MAMDANI LAUNCHES ANTI-TRUMP TOUR ACROSS FIVE BOROUGHS IN NEW YORK CITY\n\nMamdani supporters who spoke to Fox News Digital at a canvass launch in Prospect Park on Sunday dismissed the term, arguing that his primary win represented more than arbitrary labels.\n\n\"It's not necessarily communism that won the New York City primary, but the vision that he's delivering for a more affordable New York,\" said Nina, a door-knocker who wore an \"Educators for Zohran\" T-shirt on Sunday. \"That's what people voted for, and that's what he won on, and that's what he's going to win on.\"\n\nMamdani has been , including Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. Trump was quick to label him a \"100% Communist Lunatic\" after Mamdani declared victory in June.\n\nPerry, another Brooklyn canvasser, flipped the script on Trump's nickname for Mamdani, telling Fox News Digital to \"look at the people who are saying he can't do it or who are calling him a socialist or communist.\"\n\nBridget, a New York City teacher, and Perry both shook their heads in disagreement when asked if those labels worry them.\n\n\"It's not about ideology,\" said Nicholas, a Mamdani supporter who volunteered in Prospect Park on Sunday for the campaign's canvass launch. \"It's not trying to demonize these terms, , which, quite frankly, I think the American public does not have a very good idea of what those terms exactly mean.\"\n\nFox News Digital posed the same question to everyday New Yorkers in Manhattan's Union Square on Tuesday evening.\n\nOne voter, Ritvik, who said he was voting for Mamdani in the upcoming November election, despite usually leaning to the right, said the \"communist\" label didn't ;phase him.\n\n\"That kind of rhetoric has always come from the Trump administration, so not particularly surprising to me,\" Ritvik said.\n\nAnother Mamdani voter, Ian, told Fox News Digital that it's \"hard not to ignore the connection between the biggest city in America and the president.\"\n\nBut despite Trump's eagerness to criticize Mamdani, Ian said he appreciates that Mamdani is more focused on delivering for New Yorkers.\n\nMamdani hosted a weeklong \"Five Boroughs Against Trump\" tour across New York City last week.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe mayoral hopeful spoke to reporters on Wednesday after joining the Hotel & Gaming Trades Council (HTC) union for a rally outside the Surrey Hotel.\n\nThe protesters criticized the hotel for allegedly not rehiring over 100 union workers who were laid off during the pandemic.",

      "text": "Rising democratic socialist New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has secured the backing of one of the most influential figures on the American Left as he looks to edge out former Gov. Andrew Cuomo for the Democratic nomination.\nMamdani, 33, a New York state assembly member, on Tuesday secured the backing of former presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\nIt\u2019s a major boost for Mamdani, who has also scored the endorsement of progressive firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., thereby locking in the two most prominent national figures of the Left. Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders took part in a nationwide \"Fighting Oligarchy Tour\" earlier this year which tapped into discontent with President Donald Trump and sought to energize the democratic socialist movement while advocating for policies similar to Mamdani.\nAOC BACKS RISING PROGRESSIVE CANDIDATE IN NYC DEM PRIMARY IN PUSH TO DEFEAT FRONTRUNNER CUOMO\n\"We need a new politics and new leadership which is prepared to stand up to powerful corporate interests and fight for the working class,\" Sanders said in a statement, according to several reports.\n\"Zohran Mamdani is running an inspirational grassroots campaign, centered on the construction of 200,000 new affordable housing units, a rent freeze, free public buses, cutting fines and fees for small businesses, investing in citywide mental health services, city-owned grocery stores, universal free childcare and a minimum wage increase.\"\nSanders also said that Mamdani will pay for his agenda by taxing the richest 1% of New Yorkers, and said that his campaign is being funded largely through small-dollar donations, \"unlike the corporate Democratic establishment,\" in a dig at Cuomo.\nMamdani has been rising in the most recent public opinion polls in the mayoral primary race and is now a clear second to the more moderate former governor.\n\"At this dangerous moment in history, status quo politics isn\u2019t good enough,\" Sanders, who was born in Brooklyn, wrote on X on Tuesday, sharing a Mamdani post about his endorsement. \"We need new leadership that is prepared to stand up to powerful corporate interests and fight for the working class.\"\nCUOMO ADMITS TO SEEING COVID NURSING HOME DEATH REPORT, SAYS HE MAY HAVE ALTERED IT\nMamdani, who was born in Uganda and moved to the U.S. when he was 7, gushed over the endorsement in his post.\n\"As for so many across this country, @BernieSanders has been the single most influential political figure in my life,\" Mamdani wrote. \"As mayor, I will strive to live up to his example by fighting for the working class every day and hopefully make Brooklyn\u2019s own proud.\"\nWith multiple progressive candidates in the primary race, the endorsement of Mamdani by Sanders seeks to unite fractured progressive voters towards a single candidate in an attempt to block the more moderate Cuomo from returning to power.\nNew York City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and state Sen. Jessica Ramos are among the progressives still in the race. Ramos has even endorsed Cuomo while staying in the race herself.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nFour years ago, New York City's progressives failed to unite behind a single candidate, which paved the way for now-Mayor Eric Adams, a moderate Democrat, to win the primary and eventually the general election. Adams announced in early April that he would run for re-election as an independent candidate rather than seek the Democratic Party nomination.\nEarly voting kicked off on Saturday, with Election Day being on June 24.\nSanders was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1991, serving for 16 years before being elected to the Senate.\nFox News\u2019 Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report."

      "text": "President Donald Trump is reiterating his claim that the Democratic Party's nominee for mayor in the nation's most populous city is a \"communist.\"\n\"If a communist gets elected to run New York, it can never be the same,\" the president argued this week as he spoke to reporters during a Cabinet meeting at the White House.\nTrump was referring to Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old democratic-socialist assemblyman from Queens whose convincing victory two weeks ago over former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and nine other candidates in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary sent political shock waves across the country.\nFor Republicans, the strategy in reacting to Mamdani's victory is clear-cut \u2013 relentlessly paint Mamdani \u2013 who took a big step toward becoming New York City's first Muslim mayor \u2013 as an extremist and anchor him to Democrats across the country ahead of next year's midterm elections.\nTHE PLOT TO STOP MAMDANI: DEMOCRATS SCRAMBLE TO PREVENT FAR-LEFT TAKEOVER IN NYC\nFor Democrats, it's more complicated.\nMamdani surged to a primary victory thanks to an energetic campaign that put a major focus on affordability and New York City's high cost of living.\nHe made smart use of social media platforms, including TikTok, as he engaged low-propensity voters. He proposed eliminating fares to ride New York City's vast bus system, making CUNY (City University of New York) \"tuition-free,\" freezing rents on municipal housing, offering \"free childcare\" for children up to age 5, and setting up government-run grocery stores.\nRESURFACED MAMDANI PHOTO SPARKS SOCIAL MEDIA FIRESTORM\nThanks in part to the efforts of a massive grassroots army of volunteers, Mamdani rode a wave of support from younger and progressive voters to catapult into first place over Cuomo, who had been the primary frontrunner.\n\"I think it's clear that voters are prioritizing action over inaction, and not just incremental change but broad sweeping change,\" veteran Democratic strategist Joe Caiazzo told Fox News Digital, when asked about what Mamdani's victory means for the party.\nAnd Caiazzo, a veteran of Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, said one reason for Mamdani's victory was that he tirelessly met \"voters where they are.\"\nBut the Mamdani political earthquake seems to have exacerbated tensions between the party's moderate and progressive wings. It's also fueled the existing debate over whether the Democratic Party's policy, or messaging, was to blame for last November's election setbacks, when Democrats lost control of the White House and Senate, and failed to win back the House majority.\n\"Democrats continue to have a fissure in their own party, which has been made worse by Mamdani's candidacy,\" said Wayne Lesperance, a veteran political scientist and the president of New England College.\nMAMDANI'S PROFESSOR FATHER CLAIMED HITLER INSPIRED BY ABRAHAM LINCOLN\nIn New York, top Democratic Party leaders, including Gov. Kathy Hochul, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, have praised Mamdani\u2019s campaign. And while they've defended him from Trump's attacks, they have refrained, as of now, from endorsing the mayoral nominee.\nDemocratic strategist Lauren Hitt worked for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and served on the Biden-Harris 2024 presidential campaign. This year, she helped a super PAC boost Mamdani, and told Fox News that his primary victory was a \"clear rejection of the old guard.\"\nEven Matt Bennett, executive vice president for the moderate Democratic-aligned group the Third Way, acknowledged that Mamdani \"focused on affordability,\" which he said is \"great.\"\nBennett added that Mamdani is \"young, charismatic, a great communicator. All that is great. We want to see that.\"\nBut Bennett told Fox News \"the problem is he has the wrong prescription.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nWithout a singular leader steering Democrats as the party works to escape the political wilderness, the internal debates will continue.\nBut Caiazzo cautioned \"not to read too much into\" what Mamdani's victory means to the party as a whole, and argued that \"Republicans are making too much out of this.\""

      "text": "Zohran Mamdani, New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee, launched a \"Five Boroughs Against Trump\" tour in the Big Apple on Monday, as President Donald Trump's agenda takes center stage on the New York City campaign trail.\nMamdani began his anti-Trump tour alongside Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., in Manhattan on Monday morning. He plans to visit Brooklyn on Tuesday, Staten Island on Wednesday, the Bronx on Thursday and Queens on Friday, Fox News has confirmed.\nThe 33-year-old self-described socialist's tour is a rejection of the Trump administration's sweeping second-term agenda and his so-called \"authoritarian\" attack on working New Yorkers, specifically, immigration and health care reform.\n\"There is no borough that will be free from Trump's cruelty,\" Mamdani said on Monday. \"We will feel the pain of this legislation, whether we are in Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens or Staten Island, and we will shine a light this week and every week on the costs of this vision that is coming out of Washington, D.C.\"\nTRUMP CAUTIONS THAT NY WILL \u2018NEVER BE THE SAME\u2019 IF \u2018COMMUNIST\u2019 MAMDANI IS ELECTED\n\"Donald Trump is waging a full-scale assault on American democracy, dismantling our institutions, attacking our universities and our scientific research base, using government power to serve himself and his donors, and targeting New York City because New Yorkers have always seen him for what he is \u2013 a narcissistic, wannabe dictator,\" Nadler said during the event on Monday.\nNY DEMS WHO HAVE YET TO ENDORSE MAMDANI UNITE IN HIS DEFENSE AGAINST TRUMP\nAt the opening \"Manhattan Against Trump\" event, Mamdani was joined at the 1199 Service Employees International Union (SEIU) by Nadler, NYC Councilmember Carmen De La Rosa, NYC Councilmember Keith Powers, Assemblymember Harvey Epstein, Former Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger and 1199SEIU member Peggy Vujovick.\nMamdani has tied former Gov. Andrew Cuomo to Trump in recent weeks, as the latter remains in the race to run New York City as an independent candidate, despite losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani in June.\nIncumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who has developed his own public relationship with the president, is also running as an independent, and CEO of the Guardian Angels, Curtis Sliwa, is the Republican nominee.\n\"Comrade Mamdani is the American people\u2019s worst nightmare,\" White House spokeswoman, Abigail Jackson, told Fox News Digital. \"His communist policies will crater our economy, increase crime, crowd out Americans with free health care for illegal immigrants, and defund the brave men and women of law enforcement who keep us safe.\"\nThe White House added that \"Mamdani's idea of \u2018immigration reform\u2019 is no borders and amnesty for all the violent criminal illegal aliens that Joe Biden released into our country. The American people have repeatedly rejected this Communist agenda and the more Mamdani shares his radical policies, the more the American people will recoil.\"\nAs House members return to their home districts during the August recess, Democrats are uniting against Trump\u2019s \"big, beautiful bill,\" which narrowly passed through Congress last month, as congressional Democrats seek a united message ahead of competitive midterm elections expected next year.\n\"New York City needs a leader who won't give Trump an inch, who won't flinch or bargain away our rights,\" Nadler added. \"With Zohran Mamdani as mayor, we'll have a leader who will defend our hospitals, our schools and our neighbors from Trump's devastating policies. With the right mayor, with the right leadership, we can blunt Trump's attacks.\nThe New York Times reported last week that Trump recently spoke on the phone with Cuomo and has been speaking with associates about which candidate has the best chance to beat Mamdani in November. Meanwhile, Mamdani has described how his administration would be Trump's \"worst nightmare.\"\nThe president was quick to criticize Mamdani when the socialist shocked the political world and secured the Democratic nominee to become the next mayor of New York City in June, calling him a \"100% Communist Lunatic.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"We see far too many parallels between Donald Trump and Andrew Cuomo, far too many stories that make clear that both administrations have been characterized by corruption, by a sense of impunity, by an inability of an executive to understand that no means no, a prioritization of the interests of billionaires over working people, and an agenda that is driven by little else beyond the retention and accumulation of power,\" Mamdani said Monday."

Mamdani\u2019s campaign, backed by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria\u202fOcasio\u2011Cortez, has launched a \u201cFive Boroughs Against Trump\u201d tour to counter the president\u2019s policies and rally progressive voters.
