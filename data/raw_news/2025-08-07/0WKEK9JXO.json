  "title": "Octopus Renewables Infrastructure Trust's (LON:ORIT) Dividend Will Be \u00a30.0154",
  "description": "Octopus Renewables Infrastructure Trust plc's ( LON:ORIT ) investors are due to receive a payment of \u00a30.0154 per share...",
  "content": "Octopus Renewables Infrastructure Trust plc's (LON:ORIT) investors are due to receive a payment of \u00a30.0154 per share on 29th of August. This makes the dividend yield 8.6%, which will augment investor returns quite nicely.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nOctopus Renewables Infrastructure Trust's Projections Indicate Future Payments May Be Unsustainable\n\nImpressive dividend yields are good, but this doesn't matter much if the payments can't be sustained. Prior to this announcement, the company was paying out 288% of what it was earning and 75% of cash flows. While the cash payout ratio isn't necessarily a cause for concern, the company is probably focusing more on returning cash to shareholders than growing the business.\n\nLooking forward, EPS could fall by 0.2% if the company can't turn things around from the last few years. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could reach 315%, which could put the dividend in jeopardy if the company's earnings don't improve.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Octopus Renewables Infrastructure Trust\n\nEven though the company has been paying a consistent dividend for a while, we would like to see a few more years before we feel comfortable relying on it. Since 2020, the dividend has gone from \u00a30.0424 total annually to \u00a30.0602. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 7.3% over that duration. The dividend has been growing as a reasonable rate, which we like. However, investors will probably want to see a longer track record before they consider Octopus Renewables Infrastructure Trust to be a consistent dividend paying stock.\n\nThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Although it's important to note that Octopus Renewables Infrastructure Trust's earnings per share has basically not grown from where it was five years ago, which could erode the purchasing power of the dividend over time.\n\nThe Dividend Could Prove To Be Unreliable\n\nOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. The payments are bit high to be considered sustainable, and the track record isn't the best. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.",

The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling.
