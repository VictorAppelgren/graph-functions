  "description": "You won\u2019t go back to the default laptop sound once you start using this app.",
  "content": "Are you frustrated with your laptop's poor sound output? If so, then I would recommend using the FxSound app to improve your laptop's sound quality.\n\nWhat Is FxSound, and Why Should You Use It?\n\nSound quality is one of the most important aspects of any media file, especially if you are a fan of listening to music or podcast content. At times, you might compromise on video quality, but terrible audio quality can completely ruin your experience. Imagine listening to a an interview, only to find it very difficult to understand their conversation because of your laptop's poor sound quality.\n\nUnless you have any physical damage or other serious issues with your laptop speaker, you can boost your laptop's overall sound quality using FxSound.\n\nFxSound is a free, open-source app available for Windows. The app was previously known as DFX Audio Enhancer, and it was offered as a paid service for more than a decade. But recently, the developers decided to rename the app and make it completely free for users.\n\nI stumbled across this app when I was looking for a replacement for the Realtek HD Audio Manager, which used to work well on my Windows 8 device, but for some reason, didn't work as well when I switched to Windows 11.\n\nAs it turns out, most laptop manufacturers compromise on certain components, such as the speakers, to reduce the overall production cost of their devices. The use of such inexpensive speakers often results in poor sound output. However, when you install FxSound on your laptop, its high-fidelity audio engine acts as a digital sound card. The app targets and processes the sound\u2019s timbre, volume, spatial balance, and dynamics. As a result, your laptop is able to produce clearer, louder, and more balanced audio than before.\n\nThat being said, the FxSound app is for everyone\u2014even if you have a laptop with high-quality sound output. If your laptop already has excellent speakers, that\u2019s a good thing, as FxSound won\u2019t need to compensate as much as it would on a laptop with poor speakers. Overall, FxSound will allow you to get the most out of a laptop that features the best speakers.. To begin, you need to download FxSound from its official website.\n\nHow to Use FxSound on Windows\n\nIt's quite easy to use FxSound on your Windows device. To begin, you need to download FxSound from its official website. Once downloaded, install it just like you would any other application on Windows.\n\nOnce FxSound is installed, it will immediately become active, and you will notice a change in the sound quality when playing any media file. While the default settings are good enough for most systems, you also have the option to manually configure the sound settings.\n\nOn the homepage of the FxSound app, you will find two drop-down menus. The left-hand side drop-down menu allows you to choose different sound presets. By default, it is set to General, but there are plenty of other presets to choose from as well. For instance, if you are about to watch a Netflix movie or show, you should try the Movies preset.\n\nWhereas, if you want the best sound output from your device while playing your favorite game, you must switch to the Gaming preset. There are also presets like Bass Boost, which you can choose if you want to listen to music with a high boost.\n\nThe best part about the app is that you can manually adjust all the given presets as well. For instance, if you have chosen the Movies preset and want to center your bass sound a bit more, you can manually increase the second frequency line.\n\nOnce you have made changes to the frequencies, you should save the preset so that you don't have to adjust the frequency again when you switch to this preset. To do this, click the hamburger icon at the top, hover over \"Save New Preset,\" and give a name to your preset.\n\nThere are a few other options as well in the hamburger menu. The import presets option allows you to import a third-party sound preset that you have downloaded to your computer. You can also download some additional presets that FxSound has to offer. After downloading those presets, you will need to import them.\n\nThe right-hand side drop-down menu allows you to choose your default sound output.\n\nIf you find FxSound useful and want to use it every time, you can configure it as one of your startup applications. This will ensure that FxSound launches automatically when you boot your system.\n\nWhile using your system, if you want to switch to your device's default sound output, you need to open the Action Center, click the sound output icon, and choose the speaker from the output device options.\n\nThis was all about FxSound and how to use it to improve your laptop\u2019s sound quality. I have been using the app for more than a couple of years now and am really impressed by its sound output. Hopefully, you will find it useful as well and will continue to use it as the default output device on your laptop.",

      "text": "Quick Links\nSummary\nUpdating audio drivers can sometimes help, but buying a laptop with proven speakers will always get you better sound quality. Alternatively, buy a set of desktop speakers, use a spare wireless speaker, or repurpose an old hi-fi. Headphones, however, arguably provide better quality-to-cost ratio than any of these solutions.\nLaptop speakers are frequently disappointing, with all but a handful of models to choose from if sound quality is a high priority. So what can you do about it, and what's the best bang for your buck when it comes to laptop sound?\nBuy a Laptop With Decent Speakers\nIt might sound like a no-brainer, but speaker quality isn't something many people think about when it comes to buying a laptop. This is understandable since other factors like performance, build quality, and the typing experience take precedence when making a decision. The problem is that there's usually not a lot of room left in the laptop chassis for speakers that sound good.\nBut the easiest remedy to the problem of poor laptop sound is to fix it at the source and buy a laptop that meets (or exceeds) your expectations. Factor this into your buying decision, and if you already have a laptop with poor sound then keep it in mind when it's time to upgrade.\nSome media outlets like Linus Tech Tips (and sister channel ShortCircit) test laptop speakers each time they unbox a new offering. Check out other reviews to see if sound quality is mentioned. Also consider reviews and unboxing videos of other prospective purchases to see how they perform. The results can be quite varied even between different models from the same manufacturer.\nApple has made a name for itself with the sound quality of the MacBook range over the years, and the 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro continues the tradition. It's probably the best-sounding laptop out there if you can justify the cost, are happy with ARM-based Apple Silicon, and use macOS. The 2022 M2 MacBook Air follows closely behind.\nMacBook Pro (16-inch, M1 Pro, 2021)\nThe 2021 MacBook Pro is a beast of a machine both in terms of performance, build quality, battery life, and usability. It's also got the best integrated laptop speakers money can buy (probably).\nOn the Windows side of things, the Dell XPS range (including the Dell XPS 13, 15, and 17) has speakers to shout about. The HP Omen 16 (and others in the range) gaming laptop has a Bang & Olufsen speaker system that sounds good, and the ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 has also turned heads for its Dolby Atmos-capable system. Microsoft also received praise for the sound quality in the Surface Pro 7 if a small touch-screen tablet form factor is what you're looking for.\nDell XPS 13 (12th gen Core i7, 2022)\nThe Dell XPS 13 features impressive specifications for the money, with a 12th-gen Core i7 at the helm. It's also a hot contender for the \"best Windows laptop sound quality\" title.\nIf sound quality is important and you want to regularly use your laptop for watching movies, streaming videos, playing games, or listening to music; make sound quality a priority with your next purchase.\nUse a Bluetooth or AirPlay Speaker\nMany of us use Bluetooth speakers for convenience around the house, at social events, on the beach, or while camping. These battery-powered wireless speakers charge over USB and pair with just about any modern device with Bluetooth connectivity. They're ideal for use with a laptop if you haven't got any other options.\nYou can also use static speakers like Apple's HomePod mini (and discontinued HomePod) or Google's Nest and Home devices as a speaker. These lack a battery and have to be connected to mains power to work. For the HomePod, you'll need to use AirPlay which you can do from any MacBook or using iTunes on Windows. For Google devices, use the Google Home app to enable Bluetooth audio instead of using built-in services or Google Cast.\nRemember that wireless audio over Bluetooth or AirPlay may incur a delay, which might not be ideal for gaming other low latency-dependent tasks. Audio must also be compressed which can degrade the listening experience somewhat.\nUse a Home Stereo\nMost laptops still ship with a 3.5mm stereo output, which means you can plug them into just about any analog receiver you already have around the house. This could be a midi system from the 90s, a vintage 1970s integrated amplifier, or a modern stereo receiver. If you already have a stereo setup in your home you can use your laptop as a source and get some use out of it.\nIf you want the best possible sound, or your laptop lacks the required output (like the Dell XPS 13) buy a digital to analog converter (DAC). External DACs convert digital signals to analog ones at a higher quality than those inside most laptops.\nThis is a good solution if you already have an old stereo system that you're not using since you no longer play CDs or listen to FM or AM radio. Many of these systems are capable of using a computer, smartphone, tablet, or anything with 3.5mm output by selecting \"AUX\" or \"Line in\" as a source.\nAdd Some Desk Speakers\nIf you spend enough time at your desk it may be worth spending a chunk of change on some decent speakers. Most deliver better sound than the built-in speakers in any laptop you can buy, MacBook Pro included. The sky is the limit in terms of what you want to spend here, so let your budget dictate what you opt for and ideally test them out before you buy.\nA 2.1 system like the Logitech Z407 includes two satellite speakers and sub-woofer, Bluetooth and a 3.5mm connection, and a wireless control dial you can stick to your desk for quick adjustment. The Creative Pebble Plus 2.1 offers similar to users on a budget for around half the price. These are good for general use, music playback, and even gaming.\nLogitech Z407\nTake gaming, movies, and music to the next level with a Logitech Z407 2.1 system, featuring a sub-woofer and two satellite speakers with Bluetooth connectivity.\nThe Harmon Kardon SoundSticks 4 are a real statement piece, with 140w RMS power, iconic transparent design, and Bluetooth connectivity for the modern age. This system first made an impact during the days of the iMac G3 and the aesthetic has stood the test of time. Pioneer's DJ DM-50D studio monitors cost around the same but are geared to neutral response for music production on a budget.\nActive speakers are a great option if you have the budget. These come as a set of two speakers with an amplifier in each, perfect for use with a range of inputs like turntables, HDMI sources, and even smartphones. The Fives by Klipsch is a relatively well-priced speaker package for this category, with the Q Acoustics M20 system costing a bit more.\nKlipsch The Fives\nTurn heads with The Fives from Klipsch, active speakers with a real wood finish and Bluetooth connectivity.\nUse Wired or Wireless Earbuds or Headphones\nIt may be a last resort if you're looking for a speaker solution, but headphones will almost always provide better sound quality than built-in laptop speakers. Your existing wired or wireless headphones should work fine over Bluetooth with most laptops.\nComfort is a factor, especially over long periods of use since headphones are never as even the best headphones aren't as comfortable as listening to music on a loudspeaker. If this is a concern, look at open-back headphones which are less sweaty at the cost of having less sound isolation. You'll head more of the room around you and sound will leak heavily, but if you're looking for a speaker replacement this might not be a huge anyway.\nYou may also need a headphone amp (or DAC) to make the most of higher impedance headphones like the Sennheiser HD 660 S. Such a setup provides the best sound quality for your money, and your headphones and amplifier can be used with a wide variety of devices.\nUpdate Your Windows Sound Drivers\nIf you use Windows there's a chance that updating your sound driver could result in slightly better audio. You can do this two ways in Windows, either using a \"command center\" type application that shipped with a pre-built computer (from a manufacturer like Dell or HP) or by telling Windows to search the web for drivers manually.\nThe first is pretty straightforward: launch the \"command center\" that shipped with your computer and install any pending sound driver updates. The second method is also easy enough using Windows Device Manager.\nRight-click on the Start button and select \"Device Manager\" then expand the \"Sound, Video and Game Controllers\" category and find your audio device.\nRight-click on it then choose \"Update Driver\" and select \"Search automatically for updated drive software\" in the window that shows up.\nYou can also choose \"Browse by Computer for Driver Software\" if you have downloaded a specific driver from a manufacturer's website. For more, learn about fixing audio problems in Windows 10 and 11.\nManage Your Expectations\nLaptop speakers, just like modern TV speakers, are frequently disappointing. A lack of space inside the laptop forces the use of relatively small speakers and makes for a lackluster listening experience.\nBass suffers since low-end response is tied closely to the size of the sub-woofers used. Budget laptops frequently focus on raw performance at the cost of other factors, and sound quality is often at the bottom of the pile. Fortunately, adding a pair of speakers, using something you already own, or simply connecting your headphones can remedy the problem.\nBe aware of software solutions that promise to increase audio quality. Though these can add interesting effects like virtual surround sound, they rarely improve sound quality beyond what is already there. Overall sound quality is tied closely to hardware, and no amount of software (outside of perhaps improved drivers) can make up for underwhelming speakers.\nIf your laptop supports it, you might want to enable \"Windows Sonic\" spatial audio. For a space-saving device that ticks multiple boxes, consider Microsoft's all-in-one speaker and USB-C hub too."

      "text": "There's nothing quite like kicking your shoes off and settling into a binge-worthy show when the sun's knocking at your door. Whether it be weekends or late-night weekdays, sometimes the best way to beat the heat is to lie on your couch with a good series that matches the weather's vibe.\nYour Netflix summer watch list doesn't have to be filled with only the new shows you find on your Netflix app, when there are many summer shows to explore. Here are 10 Netflix shows that will be the perfect additions to your watch list as the temperature rises.\n10 Outer Banks\n|\nRelease Year |\n2020 - Present |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n4 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n40 |\n|\nStatus |\nOngoing |\nIf you're trying to find a high-stakes hunt for lost treasure riddled with themes like class conflict and law, Outer Banks can be your next watch. This mystery teen drama, set in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, follows the tensions between two young social groups: the Pogues (the working-class) and the Kooks (the elites). Tensions flare up as the Pogues' ring leader, John B, asks his friends to help uncover the mystery behind his missing father, while chasing a treasure linked to his disappearance. Along the way, the group of friends deals with romance, friendship, and betrayal, while avoiding run-ins with the law.\nOuter Banks' final season is set to be released sometime in 2026. An interactive game, Netflix Stories: Outer Banks, is available to play through the Netflix mobile app.\n9 Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha\n|\nRelease Year |\n2021 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n1 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n16 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nOne of the highest-rated dramas on Korean cable television, Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha is a staple watch for anyone getting into K-dramas. This slice-of-life romcom, set in the fictional seaside village of Gongjin (shot in Pohang), follows Yoon Hye-jin (Shin Min-a) as she moves from Seoul to the village on her late mother's birthday. Leaving behind her successful career in Seoul, Hye-jin sets up a small dentistry clinic in the village and meets Hong Du-sik, a charming handyman who helps his neighbors regularly. Their polar opposite personalities clash, but romance blooms nonetheless.\nHometown Cha-Cha-Cha became one of Netflix's most popular non-English-language series upon its release, occupying spots in the Top 10 chart for television series for several weeks. It also had a significant impact on Pohang's tourism and has cemented itself as an important part of Korean pop culture. The series is a good comfort show to watch (and rewatch) when you feel down, with its slow pacing and wholesome moments.\n8 One Day\n|\nRelease Year |\n2024 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n1 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n14 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nOne Day is one of those love stories that just tugs at your heartstrings perfectly. Based on David Nicholls' novel of the same name, this romance miniseries captures the 14-year relationship between Emma Morley (Ambika Mod) and Dexter Mayhew (Leo Woodall) after a fateful encounter during their graduation ball. Despite their differences, the two hit things off, but go their separate ways only to find their paths crossing in the future. Each episode sees a time skip of one year, taking the audience through Emma and Dexter's lives, both with and away from each other. You might recall the movie One Day, starring Anne Hathaway, that came out in 2011, which the series drew inspiration from.\nWithin a week of its release, this limited series garnered over 10 million views on Netflix. It's a rollercoaster of emotions from start to finish, and is a short watch that will have you grabbing tissues from both the tooth-rotting fluff and emotional twists.\n7 Firefly Lane\n|\nRelease Year |\n2021-2023 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n2 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n26 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nNothing beats a classic friendship story, and Firefly Lane delivers a heartwarming two-season run that you can binge-watch in a week. The decades-long friendship between two Seattle-based women, Kate Mularkey (Scrubs' Sarah Chalke) and Tully Hart (Grey's Anatomy's Katherine Heigl), from their meeting as teenagers up until their 40s, takes center stage in this romantic drama. Firefly Lane is based on Kristin Hannah's novel of the same name, and is loosely inspired by her own experiences.\nWithin 28 days of its release on Netflix, the series was watched by over 49 million people. While it can seem like a generic friendship story at first, Firefly Lane will keep you hooked, both with its coming-of-age focus and chemistry between the protagonists.\n6 Nobody Wants This\n|\nRelease Year |\n2024 - Present |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n1 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n10 |\n|\nStatus |\nOngoing |\nUnconventional romance stories with insane chemistry between the lead characters are always an entertaining watch, especially if they're short and sweet. Nobody Wants This explores the unlikely romance between a short-tempered agnostic podcaster, Joanne (The Good Place's Kristen Bell), and a rabbi, Noah (Adam Brody), after the two are introduced to each other by Joanne's best friend. Along the way come hurdles like their extremely different lifestyles, meddling families, and varying belief systems.\nNobody Wants This earned three Golden Globe Awards nominations, with Adam Brody winning a Critics' Choice Award for Best Actor in a Comedy Series. The second season of the show is set to premiere on Netflix on October 23 this year.\n5 Heartstopper\n|\nRelease Year |\n2022 - 2024 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n3 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n24 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nBased on Alice Oseman's graphic novel and web comic of the same name, Heartstopper is a British queer romance drama that blurs the lines between the coming-of-age and young adult romance genres. The series takes you through the love story between Charlie Spring (Agatha All Along's Joe Locke) and his classmate Nick Nelson (Kit Connor) as they navigate the trials of high school and young love. The lives of Charlie and Nick's friends, along with their sexualities and identities, are also explored.\nHeartstopper became one of the most-watched Netflix series at the time of its release. With animation elements seen in its source material and a soundtrack that fits right into its setting and story, Heartstopper is more than just its cast performance and adorable storyline. It's a feel-good romance that is a must-watch if you're interested in LGBTQ+ media. While it has been confirmed that there will not be a fourth season of the series, it's been reported that Heartstopper will conclude with a feature film to air on Netflix.\n4 Grace and Frankie\n|\nRelease Year |\n2015 - 2022 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n7 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n94 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nKick your summer watch list off on a light note with this acclaimed sitcom. Grace and Frankie focuses on the odd yet hilarious friendship between retired cosmetics mogul Grace Hanson (Jane Fonda) and artist Frankie Bergstein (Lily Tomlin), after their divorce-attorney husbands fall in love with each other and leave them. Their lives are thrown off track, but the women find themselves living together and navigating personal and familial conflicts as their friendship slowly blossoms.\nGrace and Frankie received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations and a Golden Globe Award nomination in its eight-season run. While its first season received average ratings, the succeeding seasons of the show were met with largely positive reviews, given the cast's performance, plot, and writing.\n3 Love on the Spectrum\n|\nRelease Year |\n2022 - Present |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n3 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n20 |\n|\nStatus |\nOngoing |\nEven if you're not a big fan of reality shows, you don't want to miss out on Love on the Spectrum. Based on the original Australian show, this American version uses a similar documentary-style format and follows people on the autism spectrum as they try to find love. The show highlights how they navigate the evolving world of dating and relationships while forming new connections.\nLove on the Spectrum won five Primetime Emmy Awards for casting, directing, and the award for Outstanding Unstructured Reality Program. Critics have praised it for its humanized portrayal of autistic people. However, there has been slight criticism about certain aspects of the show, including the date settings and the lack of insight into established autistic couples, which was explored more in the show's Australian counterpart. The show has been renewed for a fourth season.\n2 Spy X Family\n|\nRelease Year |\n2022 - Present |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n2 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n37 |\n|\nStatus |\nOngoing |\nFor a wholesome anime to watch this summer, Spy X Family is an entertaining, family-friendly show that will have you hooked on its premise. Based on one of the best-selling mangas of all time, the comedy show is about the eccentric Forger family\u2014an undercover spy father, a secret assassin mother, and a telepathic daughter.\nBeing tasked with building a family to keep his disguise intact and getting close to a notable political figure, Agent Twilight takes on the name of Loid Forger and enrolls his adopted daughter, Anya, in the same school as his target's son. Hilarity (and emotions) ensues as the Forgers protect their secrets from each other while trying to function as a relatively normal family.\nThe series has won several Japanese film accolades and has consistently received high ratings. A film, Spy x Family Code: White, was released in 2023, and a third season of the series is slated to release in October this year.\n1 Never Have I Ever\n|\nRelease Year |\n2020 - 2023 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n4 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n40 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nNever Have I Ever is one of Netflix's most popular comedy-drama shows, with plot points reminiscent of early 2000s high school shows. What makes it different, however, is that the story is steeped in cultural identity and family dynamics that are a bit different from your typical young adult stories.\nCreated by The Office's Mindy Kaling and Brooklyn Nine-Nine writer Lang Fisher, Never Have I Ever is about an American-Tamil teenager, Devi (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan), who copes with life after losing her father. Her relationship with her mother, a messy love triangle between her two crushes, and her friendships send Devi (and the audience) on a rollercoaster ride. Meanwhile, the story explores South Indian culture from the diaspora point of view, through Devi's family members and their stories.\nThe show features guest narration from SNL's Andy Samberg and model Gigi Hadid, which aims to break the fourth wall and connect the audience to the characters' thoughts. Within two months of its release, the show was viewed by over 40 million households.\nIf you want to find more shows on your summer watch list while searching for a specific genre, like romance or comedy, you can use Netflix's Secret Codes in your app's search bar to filter out genre-specific titles. This makes finding new (and sometimes underrated) shows much easier than simply surfing your Home tab."

      "text": "I used to update to the latest version of Windows the moment it became available, but when Windows 11 launched, I didn't really like it and quickly reverted to Windows 10. Now that Windows 10 support is ending soon, I've given Windows 11 another try, and it's not as bad as I thought.\nWhy I Upgraded to Windows 11\nWhen I built my new PC last month, I was faced with two options: stay with Windows 10 until October and then consider updating, or bite the bullet and make the switch now.\nAs it currently stands, Windows 10 support is scheduled to end in October 2025. While I could technically continue using it, it's not a good idea. First, it would expose my PC to security threats, and second, it would limit overall software support. As developers shift their focus to Windows 11, apps for Windows 10 will likely receive fewer updates or face more bugs. Even the first-party Microsoft Office will no longer be supported.\nWhat tipped the scales was the latest Windows 11 24H2 update brought a ~10% performance improvement for AMD CPUs. Since I bought a Ryzen 7 7700, this was a no-brainer. If you're not familiar with performance figures, that's a substantial improvement (roughly equivalent to a newer generation CPU). Plus, as a tech journalist, I should stay on the bleeding edge so that I'm in the know.\nI Made 11 Behave More Like Windows 10\nAfter going through Windows's pesky setup process (called the \"Windows Out of Box Experience\"), I was greeted by a home screen that felt somewhat unfamiliar, though not entirely foreign. While everything was technically there, it wasn't in the same place I was used to from older versions of Windows.\nLike many other people, I'm sensitive to any major changes in my primary operating system. So, to ease my initial OS anxiety, I made Windows 11 look like Windows 10. The most glaring problem I had was the Start menu being in the center. It felt out of place, as if it didn't belong there. Fortunately, I fixed this by simply moving it to the bottom left corner where it belongs.\nMy second complaint had to do with the new right-click context menu in File Explorer. In theory, it's designed to help users find commonly-used options for a specific file. For example, options like \"Cut\" and \"Copy\" were replaced with easy-to-understand icons at the top so the context menu could take up less space.\nWhile I can appreciate this reinvention (and I'm sure some people love it), it's not for me. I've been using Windows for two decades and know the old context menu like the back of my hand. Fortunately, I was able to get the legacy context menu back, and I was off to the races.\nThe Interface Improvements Are Subtle but Meaningful\nOnce I configured Windows 11 to my liking, I was surprised by how similar it felt to 10. The Start menu is more intuitive and has more room for my apps, the taskbar is slightly taller and easier to use, the Task Manager feels more modern, the new Settings app is better organized, and the ugly Action Center (right-side menu) from Windows 10 has been revamped into a smaller, sleeker system tray. I also appreciate the expanded support for system-wide dark mode.\nAll these small changes add up to create a better user experience without altering how I interact with the system. Another great example of a small but meaningful change is the calmer error sound, which doesn't induce panic like the older Windows error sounds.\nI Love the New Notepad\nI'm singling out Notepad because it's my most-used Windows app. I use it for everything\u2014note-taking, brainstorming, quick calculations, and more. The new Windows 11 Notepad retains all the core components that make it great but in a better package. It's sleeker, automatically saves your notes, has more text editor features, and supports tabs. Oh, and it finally supports dark mode.\nWhen I first heard about these Notepad changes, I was worried that it might become too bloated. However, Microsoft has done an excellent job of enhancing my beloved app without losing its simplicity.\nIf you're still on the fence about Windows 11, that's understandable. You can continue using Windows 10 until October, but by then, I'd strongly recommend making the switch (or maybe even trying Linux). The good news is that Windows 11 is pretty solid\u2014certainly better than it was at launch."

      "text": "Windows isn't usually the operating system that comes to mind when the phrase \"open source\" gets thrown around, but make no mistake: many of the best Windows apps today are open source. Here are a few great ones I use daily.\n7 NanaZip\nWindows can handle the basics of ZIP files and other archive formats, like opening and extracting files, but it can\u2019t handle the huge range of formats out there. It doesn't offer the kind of granular control you might want while creating an archive either.\nLuckily, there is an open-source project that makes up for all of those deficiencies and more: NanaZip, which is a fork of 7-Zip.\n7-Zip has been around for years, can handle almost any archive or compression format you\u2019ll regularly encounter, and gives you an incredible amount of control when you\u2019re creating or managing archives.\nNanaZip builds on that foundation and gives you a modern user interface that meshes nicely with Windows 11.\nIt also fully integrates with the right-click context menu on Windows 11, which means you don\u2019t need to launch the app to perform basic operations, like adding a file to an archive or extracting the contents of a ZIP somewhere.\nNanaZip also includes support for additional security features that power users might find helpful.\n6 BitWarden\nMemorizing passwords is a pain, and getting them all synchronized between devices is an even bigger pain. However, BitWarden, an open-source password manager, solves the problem completely.\nAny time you enter a password, BitWarden will securely save your login so that you can instantly access it on any of your devices.\nIf you\u2019re having trouble thinking of a unique password for a new account somewhere, BitWarden is also capable of generating a strong passphrase or password for you to ensure you're not reusing them.\nOnce you save a login, you can sort it into a folder to keep things more organized.\nBitWarden runs on every major desktop and mobile operating system, which guarantees you\u2019re not going to run into issues between devices.\nAdditionally, it lets you store passkeys (an alternative to passwords), credit card information, and SSH keys.\n5 VLC\nWindows 11 comes with a few different media players built-in, but none rival the capabilities of the open-source video player VLC.\nVLC has been popular for years due to its ease of use, flexible interface, and customizability. It supports almost any media format out of the box, and can even be used to convert between formats. If you don't like how a video looks, you can use VLC to tweak it to your liking.\n4 VSCodium\nVSCodium is a slightly stripped-down version of Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a popular jack-of-all-trades text editor.\nNeither VSCode nor VSCodium are \"true\" integrated development environments (IDEs), but the number of extensions and plugins available for almost every programming language bring them close enough. Unless I need something specific, VSCodium is the first program I reach for when I need to do some coding on Windows or Linux.\nRecently, I\u2019ve been using it in combination with Rust-Analyzer for a few embedded projects with no hitches whatsoever.\nThe only significant difference between VSCode and VSCodium is telemetry: VSCode phones some telemetry back to Microsoft, while VSCodium has that portion removed. There are also some extensions available for VSCode that aren\u2019t available for VSCodium, but most of the important ones are present.\n3 KDE Connect\nKDE Connect is an open-source application that lets you access your phone from your PC, or vice versa. You can wirelessly send and receive files over your local network, reply to texts, and interact with notifications.\nIn many ways, it is similar Microsoft's Phone Link, but it doesn't require an account.\nKDE Connect works on Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android, so you won't have any problems mixing and matching ecosystems if that is your style.\n2 PowerToys\nPowerToys is probably the most versatile collection of tools available for Windows, and all of them are free and open source. It contains everything from a color picker to a more advanced window manager to Command Palette, which has totally replaced the Start Menu in my day-to-day workflow.\nI use about a dozen utilities from PowerToys daily for both work and my leisure projects. They can all be enabled or configured from within PowerToys itself\u2014no hunting around for configuration files or external downloads necessary.\n1 Firefox\nThere are few apps that see more use than browsers, and it is important to pick one you like.\nFirefox is privacy-friendly and has an incredible range of extensions available for it. Additionally, it is one of the few remaining browsers that isn\u2019t based on Chromium (the project behind Google Chrome, Brave, and Microsoft Edge).\nBecause it is built on an entirely different framework, Firefox still supports extensions and features you won\u2019t find in Chromium-based browsers.\nAbove and beyond the browser itself, Firefox is backed by the Mozilla foundation, which has a pretty good privacy and security track record\u2014an important factor in the internet era.\nWhile there are some software suites that don't have perfect replicas in the open source world, it is always worth checking for one first. Open-source applications are transparent (if you care to audit the code), customizable, and\u2014best of all\u2014free."

      "text": "Quick Links\nSummary\n- Easily add any app, file, or folder to start with Windows by adding it to the Windows \"Startup\" folder. It works in all versions of Windows.\n- Open the \"Startup\" folder by using the \"shell:startup\" command in the \"Run\" box or by navigating to %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup.\n- You can also use Task Scheduler to automatically open a program based on specific conditions,\nSome Windows apps configure themselves to automatically start whenever Windows boots. But you can make any app, file, or folder start with Windows by adding it to the Windows \"Startup\" folder.\nCheck the App's Settings to Change Startup Options\nMany apps have an option built in to their settings that let you determine whether or not they'll automatically launch when you boot up your PC. Unfortunately, we can't tell you \"look here!\" because the location varies wildly between apps. However, if the setting exists, that is typically the quickest way to control an app's startup behavior.\nVery often you'll be prompted to set an app's startup behavior during setup.\nKeep in mind that the more programs you start on boot, the longer the startup process will appear to take. If there are any apps you don't want to start on boot, you can disable certain startup programs too.\nStep One: Open the Windows Startup Folder\n\"Startup\" is a hidden system folder that you can navigate to in File Explorer (provided you're showing hidden files). Technically, it's located in \"%APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\"\n, but you don't need to open up File Explorer and start browsing---there's a much easier way to get there.\nYou can open many of Windows' hidden and special folders directly using the \"shell\" command if you know the folders' names. And you can launch the \"shell\" command right from the \"Run\" dialog box.\nTo open the \"Startup\" folder the easy way, just hit Windows+R to open the \"Run\" box, type \"shell:startup,\" and then press Enter.\nThis will open a File Explorer window right to the \"Startup\" folder.\nGo ahead and leave that window open, because we're going to be working with it in the next section.\nStep Two: Create a Shortcut in the \"Startup\" Folder to Add a Program to Startup\nTo make an app, file, or folder start with Windows, all you have to do is create a shortcut to the item inside the \"Startup\" folder. We're going to be working with a handy little app named Sizer as our example, but this technique applies no matter what you're creating a shortcut to.\nFirst, locate the item to which you want create your shortcut. Just open a second File Explorer window and find the executable, file, or folder you want to start at boot. There are different ways to create shortcuts in Windows, but we're fans of the super quick right-drag method: hold your right mouse button down and drag the item you want to create the shortcut for to the \"Startup\"folder. When you release the button, a popup menu with a few options appears. Click \"Create shortcut here.\"\nThat's all you have to do. You'll now see a shortcut to your item in the \"Startup\" folder.\nThe next time you start Windows, your app, file, or folder will launch right along with it. This method even works for launching Windows Store Apps at startup.\nHow to Make Startup Programs Load Faster\nWhen you're using Windows 10 or 11, there's a delay before your startup programs actually start to launch, which is probably there to help everything feel like it's functional earlier in the startup process and allow for all of the internal Windows features to fully start running. But if you've got a really fast PC, you might not need to bother with that delay.\nYou can remove the delay by opening up Registry Editor and browsing down to the following key:\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\\nOnce there, create a key named Serialize, and then a new 32-bit DWORD called \"StartupDelayInMSec\"\nunderneath it with the value set to 0.\nOr you could just head over to our article on removing the Windows 10 startup delay and grab the registry hack files that automate it for you. Up to you!\nAlternative Method for Power Users: Use Task Scheduler for More Control\nWhile we certainly would recommend simply using the shell:startup trick, you can also use Task Scheduler to run processes at system startup, when you log on, during idle times, or even when you lock or unlock your screen. It's an incredibly powerful tool for more advanced users who want to automate their computer to do things like creating System Restore Points at startup or automatically waking up at a certain time.\nTo launch a program at Startup using Task Scheduler, you can open up Task Scheduler using the Start menu search box, go to Action and then Create Basic Task, and follow the prompts. You should actually use the \"Log on\" option if you're trying to run a regular program.\nTask Scheduler is a pretty useful tool if you want to fine-tune startup behaviors, and using it isn't really that difficult."
