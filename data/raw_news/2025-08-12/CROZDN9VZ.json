  "description": "If you\u2019re looking for hints and answers for Wednesday, August 13, 2025 with the theme \u201cHitchcock festival,\u201d read on.",
  "content": "If you\u2019re looking for hints and answers for Strands for Wednesday, August 13, 2025, read on\u2014I\u2019ll share some clues and tips, and finally the solution to the puzzle with the theme \u201cHitchcock festival.\u201d\n\nFor an easy way to come back to our Strands hints every day, . You can also find our past hints there as well, in case you want to know what you missed in a previous puzzle. (If you play , , or , check out our hints for those games, too.)\n\nBelow, I\u2019ll give you some oblique hints at today\u2019s Strands answers. And farther down the page, I\u2019ll reveal the spangram and the answers. Scroll slowly and take just the hints you need!\n\nHint for the spangram in today\u2019s Strands puzzle\n\nWhat you might see listed on a Hitchcock-themed event poster.\n\nHint for the theme words in today\u2019s Strands puzzle\n\nWe\u2019re about to give away the answers to today\u2019s Strands puzzle.\n\nWhat is the spangram in today\u2019s Strands?\n\nWhat are the theme words in today\u2019s Strands?\n\nHere\u2019s what the board looks like when the puzzle is solved:\n\nI assume today will feature Alfred Hitchcock movie titles. Yeah, there\u2019s FILMTITLE across the bottom, which forms the spangram. \ud83d\udfe1\n\nTOPAZ, a movie title, is in the upper left. \ud83d\udd35\n\nI don\u2019t see BIRDS or NORTH or NORTHWEST or VERTIGO or REAR or WINDOW. Hmm.\n\nLIFEBOAT is in the upper right. \ud83d\udd35\n\nOh wait, there\u2019s VERTIGO, going from the bottom to the top. \ud83d\udd35\n\nPSYCHO is to the right of VERTIGO. \ud83d\udd35\n\nROPE is along the right edge, near the bottom. \ud83d\udd35\n\nYou can find the Strands game on the New York Times website and in the NYT Games app.\n\nWhen you start playing, you\u2019ll see a game board with an assortment of letters, flanked by a clue that gives a hint at the board\u2019s theme\u2014this will be a phrase, like \u201cBetter with age.\u201d Your job is to find the hidden words within the board that reflect the puzzle\u2019s theme.\n\nThe most important word to find is the \u201cspangram,\u201d a word that more explicitly states the puzzle\u2019s theme. (For example, the spangram for the puzzle with the theme \"Better with age\" is FERMENTED, which describes products that are, you guessed it, better with age.) The spangram will span the entire game board, either from left to right or top to bottom (hence the name). When you find the spangram, it will be highlighted in yellow. Solving the spangram usually makes the rest of the puzzle much easier to complete.\n\nIn Strands, words can travel any direction (up, down, left, right, and diagonal), and you will only use each letter once. There is only one correct solution. When you correctly identify one of the puzzle\u2019s words (for example, KOMBUCHA, MISO, or KIMCHI), it will be highlighted in blue.\n\nIf you are struggling to solve the puzzle, you can submit any non-theme words you see (as long as they are four letters or more) to receive credit toward a single hint. If you submit three non-theme words, the \u201cHint\u201d button will be clickable; if you click it, all of the letters in one of the theme words will be highlighted for you. You will still have to link these highlighted letters in the right order to form one of the theme words. If there is already a hint on the board and you use another hint before solving for that word, that word\u2019s letter order will be revealed.\n\nUnlike Connections and Wordle, you cannot fail Strands. When you submit guesses, you will either correctly identify an answer, receive credit toward a hint, or the text will shake back and forth, indicating that the word you submitted is too short or not valid. You can't run out of guesses, and there is no time limit.\n\nYou win when you\u2019ve correctly used all the letters on the board, meaning that you have identified the spangram and all of the theme words. Like other NYT games, upon solving the puzzle, you will see a shareable card that indicates how you performed that day: blue dots \ud83d\udd35 indicate theme words you found, the yellow dot \ud83d\udfe1 indicates when you found the spangram, and a lightbulb \ud83d\udca1 indicates words that you received a hint for.\n\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to yesterday's Strands.",

(For example, the spangram for the puzzle with the theme \"Better with age\" is FERMENTED, which describes products that are, you guessed it, better with age.) The spangram will span the entire game board, either from left to right or top to bottom (hence the name). When you find the spangram, it will be highlighted in yellow. Solving the spangram usually makes the rest of the puzzle much easier to complete.\nIn Strands, words can travel any direction (up, down, left, right, and diagonal), and you will only use each letter once. There is only one correct solution. When you correctly identify one of the puzzle\u2019s words (for example, KOMBUCHA, MISO, or KIMCHI), it will be highlighted in blue.\nIf you are struggling to solve the puzzle, you can submit any non-theme words you see (as long as they are four letters or more) to receive credit toward a single hint. If you submit three non-theme words, the \u201cHint\u201d button will be clickable; if you click it, all of the letters in one of the theme words will be highlighted for you. You will still have to link these highlighted letters in the right order to form one of the theme words. If there is already a hint on the board and you use another hint before solving for that word, that word\u2019s letter order will be revealed.\nHow to win Strands\nUnlike Connections and Wordle, you cannot fail Strands. When you submit guesses, you will either correctly identify an answer, receive credit toward a hint, or the text will shake back and forth, indicating that the word you submitted is too short or not valid. You can't run out of guesses, and there is no time limit.\nYou win when you\u2019ve correctly used all the letters on the board, meaning that you have identified the spangram and all of the theme words. Like other NYT games, upon solving the puzzle, you will see a shareable card that indicates how you performed that day: blue dots \ud83d\udd35 indicate theme words you found, the yellow dot \ud83d\udfe1 indicates when you found the spangram, and a lightbulb \ud83d\udca1 indicates words that you received a hint for.\nNot the day you're after? Here's the solution to today's Strands."

A fully charged Anker 25,000mAh power bank typically delivers about 13,750 to 17,500mAh.\n-\nHow can I estimate the number of charges for my device?\nTo estimate the number of charges, use this formula: (Power Bank Total Capacity \u00d7 0.65) \u00f7 Device Battery Capacity. For example, a device with a 3,349mAh battery can receive approximately 4.8 charges from a 25,000mAh power bank.\n-\nHow long does it take to recharge the power bank?\nThe recharge time depends on the charger's power and the ambient temperature. Using a 100W or higher charger at 77\u00b0F (25\u00b0C), it typically takes about 2 hours to fully recharge the power bank.\n-\nDoes it support pass-through charging?\nYes, the power bank supports pass-through charging. However, it requires a charger rated at 20W or higher, and the input power must exceed the output power to enable this feature.\n-\nIs it normal for the power bank to display \"No Recharging Mode\"?\nYes. When the power bank exceeds 127\u00b0F (53\u00b0C) while charging or 136\u00b0F (58\u00b0C) while discharging, it temporarily pauses recharging for safety. It will continue discharging until the temperature drops and then resume charging.\nProduct guides and documents\nFrom the brand\n-\nWe want you to live without the inconvenience and uncertainty of where your next charge is coming from.\nOur chargers and accessories don't just power up your devices, they offer the tech experience you want with zero restrictions.\n-\nFast access to today's prime\n-\nPower to Drive Your Prime\n-\nUltimate Power to Keep Giving\n-\nDoubly Fast in a Snap\n-\nPro Fast Charging in a Nano\n-\nAnker's Sustainability Plan\n-\nGet Powered Up Now\n-\nSeries 7 I Future Technology\n-\nSeries 5 I Higher Quality\n-\nSeries 6 I Unique Experiences\n-\nSustainability features\nThis product has sustainability features recognized by trusted certifications.\nCarbon emissions from the lifecycle of this product were measured, reduced and offset.\nCustomer reviews\nCustomer Reviews, including Product Star Ratings help customers to learn more about the product and decide whether it is the right product for them.\nTo calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don\u2019t use a simple average.

From all my research in the tech space, this seemed like the portable charger to get. I sometimes have spontaneous plans after work, and so I needed something I could throw into my backpack just incase I'm out all day and need to charge up my phone.\nI like that this comes with a high quality carrying bag, so I can toss it in my work bag without fear that it'll scratch or wear much.\nAlso I enjoy all the data this gives. Battery health, cycle count, wattage per output, temperatures, etc.\nBattery health and cycle count are great to see the continued effectiveness of the battery. The cables that come with it are also high quality and convenient. I like that the retractable one has a magnetic tip to fold down, and stay down in its divot. The other table is braided, and my worry was that actually using it as a wrist-strap or carrying-loop, but the design is such that pulling on it cements it into the holster for it (think Chinese finger-trap).\nThe wattage gives me confidence that my device is fast charging, so I can quickly get back some battery and put the portable charger back down.\nIt's all of these little things that make this feel like a high-quality, durable, and long-term investment.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 23, 2025Color: BlackVerified PurchaseThe Anker Laptop Powerbank is an absolute powerhouse!

A reliable companion for anyone needing serious on-the-go power!\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2025Color: BlackVerified PurchaseThis is the first power bank I've owned that isn't pocket-friendly and that worried me before I bought it. Luckily my worries were a red herring because this is the best designed, travel-ready power bank I've ever used. It is perfectly sized to be thrown into a travel bag with all of your other electronics and the two integrated USB-C cables are perfect for all your electronics.\nPower & Performance:\nAll three USB-C outputs can deliver up to 100W, with total output of 165W\nCan charge most iPhones 4+ times and get large laptops from 0-50% quickly\nCan charge a Lenovo laptop in about 2 hours while only using 50% of the power bank's capacity\nRecharges itself at up to 100W, which is super fast\nSmart Display: Features a detailed display showing temperature and wattages for each of the four outputs, with real-time charging information.\nBuild Quality: Very well built, with every material and panel feeling solid and confident to withstand normal wear and tear.\nBest For:\nPower users who travel with laptops and multiple devices\nPeople who frequently forget charging cables\nThose who need fast charging capabilities\nUsers who want detailed charging information via the display\nConsider Alternatives If:\nYou primarily charge phones and small devices (may be overkill)\nWeight is a major concern for your use case\n- Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2025Color: SilverVerified PurchaseGreat charger. It is heavy and a bit chunky, but it works great. The 2 usb C cables that are attached are a great idea. It is a grab and go item. Fits in my laptop bag and keeps my laptop and phone going all day. I don't know how many individual charges this will provide on a full charge, but it is ideal for what I need with a 3 yr old laptop whose battery has degraded a little over time. This keeps me going when I don't have available power. The Prime Day price drop was also a huge plus for me getting this.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2025Color: BlackVerified PurchaseIs this expensive? Yes. But it really is worth it in my opinion. The fact that I can charge my M3 Mac Pro is amazing. It comes with two built in USB-C cables, which means I don't have to worry about what happens if I forget one. The screen is nice and is helpful to figure out how to parse out your charging for all your different devices.\nThis thing is HEAVY, just something to consider. It makes sense, with all that battery it's going to be pretty heavy. Still, I wouldn't recommend expecting to toss it in your purse and not dislocate your shoulder. It's a convenient size and the strap (which doubles as the second cable) is cool. Though I do have to question the longevity of that cable dangle such a heavy item on it. We'll see. Stays cool even when charging my phone and a laptop. Definitely recommend!\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 16, 2025Color: SilverVerified PurchaseI\u2019ve been using my Anker power bank for a while now, and it\u2019s been incredibly reliable. It charges my phone and other devices quickly and efficiently, and I never have to worry about running out of battery when I\u2019m on the go. Whether I\u2019m traveling, commuting, or just out for the day, it gives me peace of mind knowing I have backup power whenever I need it.\nThe build quality is excellent it feels solid and well made, but still compact enough to fit easily in my bag. I really like the simple, no fuss design and how easy it is to use. Just plug in and go. It also charges up quickly, which is super helpful when I\u2019m in a rush.\nOverall, I highly recommend this Anker power bank to anyone looking for a trustworthy and portable charging solution.

Please reload the page.\n- Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024Style: Without AppleCare+Verified PurchaseI\u2019ve tried several hearing aid substitutes over the years, my past favorite being the now unavailable Bose Hearphones and costing $500. Rather than just a sound amplifier, these had several functions allowing you to filter and focus sounds in various ways and for various situations. They were pretty good.\nBut now Apple has added some great features to their AirPods 2\u2014features that function like far more expensive hearing aids and at less than half the price of the Bose product. I\u2019ve owned these for a month or so and am now just getting the hang of how to use them. If there is a downside to these earbuds it is the rather deep and confusing tech included in them (or, at least confusing for a grandfatherly type like me). Once they are Bluetooth connected to your iPhone (They connect very easily with the button on the front of the EarPod\u2019s charging case.) they should automatically connect every time you put them in your ears. You will then be able to access all the functions by tapping the \u201csettings\u201d app on your phone. You will find a heading near the top of the list just below the box with your name and iCloud options. Tapping on this will allow you to drill down through several pages of options. There are a lot of options there and it can be confusing, but experimenting with the various functions will help you figure out their purpose.\nThe key here is to drill down to find the hearing test. This will quickly test for hearing loss by leading you through a series of tones of varying in pitch and volume. The end result will be an audiogram that can be used to program your EarPods as hearing aids. As stated before, it took me several weeks to find and activate this feature, but when I did a whole new experience dawned. Just be patient and search around for this function. It works very well.\nOf course, these things also serve as EarPods to listen to music or podcasts. (May I recommend \u201cPat Gray Unleashed!\u201d if your bent is conservative commentary and just plain fooling around). The quality of sound is phenomenal and the buds are more comfortable than most to keep in your ears for an extended time. To control the volume for this function you can TRY to use the external control buttons located on those silly looking stems that hang out of your ears (good luck) OR just open the \u201cControl Center\u201d page (slide one finger upward on your iPhone screen to access this page) where you\u2019ll find the volume slider. If your EarPods are connected and in your ears you\u2019ll see the slider is marked as controlling the AirPods.\nI really like these things now that I\u2019m a little more familiar with them. The quality and value are exquisite. If I discover more, I\u2019ll edit this comment.\n4 MONTHS LATER: Apple has improved the controls for these in their latest iOS update. The functions I had to dig around to find are now more easily accessed. Getting to the hearing test is now fairly straight forward.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2025Style: Without AppleCare+Verified PurchaseThe AirPods Pro 2.0 earbuds are very close to perfection. I have four pairs. Two with the lightning connectors, and two with the now standard USB-C connectors. My USB-C pairs have the Mag-Lock charging as well. The sound is awesome! There are earbuds with more bass and higher volumes. But I believe for recreating quality live sound the Airpods produce clear sound that rivals listening to live music. They put out a reasonable amount of bass. I don\u2019t honestly think that folks will be satisfied if you want ear shattering bass. The vocals are crisp. The battery life is pretty darn good too! Even the first pair that I purchased in 2023 still runs for at least 4.5 hours playing music. If the Airpods are totally dead, they\u2019re recharged in about an hour. With the different sized silicone eartips, they will comfortably fit in most ears. Plus when they wear out, you can purchase replacements on Apple\u2019s store, or right here on Amazon. I think one of the best features is the sound dampening ability. I usually have this feature on. I believe that even with no music playing the Airpods cut noise down by at least 50%-70%. You can have the microphones set to when you start talking, they let sounds through. I think the microphones are of wonderful quality. The clarity is really good. It is very rare that someone says they\u2019re having a hard time hearing me. About the only negative is they are susceptible to interference from other devices every once in awhile. This is more prevalent in the summer than in the cooler months. They are discounted now to $169.00! This is much better than paying $249 or even $199. These are the best cordless earbuds I have ever purchased. I would definitely recommend these Airpods Pro 2.0 for the value they are.

YMMV\u2026 So, for those of us crusty old codgers with beat up ears, here's an interesting discovery I made today:\nI (unsurprisingly) listen to a lot of stuff while working out in my shop. And as a DOACA (\"Dude of a Certain Age\") who worked as a roadie & stage tech in the age of Grunge, I have pretty pronounced tinnitus, so I'm doubly careful about my hearing when using some of my larger shop tools, like my cabinet saw, mill, etc, which means I'm often putting hearing protection on, and taking it off repeatedly. I have a decent \"bone conduction\" headset that allows for environmental awareness, but the protectors don't work with those on. I have tried a few wireless earbuds (most recently the well reviewed certain-Lab \u201cMini\u201ds) but there was some problem or other with all of them (the Minis sound great, but have terrible connectivity).\nSo I finally sucked it up and got a set of Apple AirPod Pro 2s (yeah, mostly after hearing Adam Savage rave about them in a recent video you can easily find.) An interesting thing about them is that Apple actually worked with the US FDA (for those of you not in America, that's the federal agency that regulates medical devices here in the States\u2014you need to be certified by them to make any medical claims about a product or device) and got these to be certified as Class II hearing aids in the US and Canada. And in addition to a clinical-grade hearing test feature included that runs in the app, the Hearing Aid feature is easy to employ, and actually useful. But that's not what has me so jazzed about these.\nAside from the Bluetooth being rather astounding (my wife took my phone to the other end of the house about 40' away, with our chimney stack between us, and stuck it in her sock drawer\u2014totally fine), the noise cancellation is *shockingly* good. And this is where things get interesting, and where we get back around to my tinnitus.\nPutting these in my ears this morning while sitting in my dining area, next to our furnace closet with the HVAC running, the ANC immediately kicked in. And even with no music or sound playing, the furnace noise (I'd guess about ~50dB) just... *disappeared*. I literally had to take them out and put them back in a few times to see if I was going a bit bonkers. But not only did that sound disappear, but my tinnitus\u2014a group of between five and seven tones of various frequencies between 4kHz - 8/9kHz that has a perceived volume of about 40dB all the time\u2014suddenly had its volume \"turned down\" by about 10-15dB.\nIt was rather startling.\nI've heard those tones from the age of 17 on (I'm now 57). Incessantly. Unforgivingly. Perpetually.\nFor them to get quieter was pretty amazing.\nI suspect that the Active Noise Cancellation is at play here. If you're not aware, AirPods have microphones built into them. The main, obvious ones, are the little sticks that come off them outside your ears that listen to the environment around them. But there is a second set of microphones that detect the sounds *inside your ear canal when the buds are in them* that are likely the heroes here. The buds take both of those sound profiles (technically, it's *four* sound signatures\u2014two for each ear) and then uses machine learning combined with Apple's H2 chip to create \"anti-noise.\"\nNow, anti-noise is nothing new: I mean, *that's how ANC works*. It's also nothing new to tinnitus sufferers, either. \"Noise generators\" have been around for decades. There are even apps available that allow you to pump white, gray, pink, brown, or other noise \"colors,\" or other environmental sounds (ocean waves, rain, fireplace crackling, etc) into your ears -via- buds throughout the day to \"mask\" tinnitus. Many people have decent luck with this kind of tinnitus self-treatment\u2014I never have.\nI suspect that it's the inner microphones (Apple is one of a handful of current makers that have this) that are really helping to effectively mask the sound that gets past the bud seals, combined with (love 'em or hate 'em) Apple's crazy level of R&D that gets these buds to analyze not only the environmental noise profile *outside* the buds, but the sound that *gets past the buds*. This winds up being a broader noise profile, so the buds generate a broader palate of anti-noise, and then puts it *right in your ear*.\nNow to be clear, I can still hear my tinnitus tones. They're just less present in the... what? *\"auditory mix\"* in my head. But boy oh boy is the change noticeable. At least for now. It may be that in time my ears get used to the trick. But as of right now? I'm fine with being fooled.\nIt may be that other buds with ANC also do this, but I can't speak to any other solutions except the comparison to my -Labs. I get nothing if you buy these or any other buds. This is just my experience, but as someone who's lived with this affliction for so long, ANY positive change is important enough for me to take time, write down, and share my experience. YMMV.\nIf you have tinnitus, or hearing problems (or suspect you might) these are a serious consideration."
