    "reason": "Sherrod Brown’s comeback campaign is a political event focused on a single U.S. Senator’s re‑election bid. It does not represent a macro policy change, central bank action, or sectoral driver that would have a measurable impact on financial markets or trading decisions. The topic is therefore not actionable for macro or portfolio strategy and should be excluded.",
