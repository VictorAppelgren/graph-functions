  "description": "In times of uncertainty, firms can\u2019t afford to have payments among the unknown quantities they\u2019re facing down.  Yet in B2B, money has always moved slowly,",

For decades, corporate procurement and supplier payments were governed by entrenched terms, often designed to tilt the advantage toward one party.\n\nThe buyer sought to conserve cash; the supplier sought to get paid as quickly as possible. Between them lay a battlefield of net-30, net-60 or even net-90 payment terms, late fees and financing workarounds.\n\nToday, that battlefield is transforming into something more like a negotiation table. Under the combined weight of ongoing tariff-driven uncertainty, macroeconomic disruptions and cash flow volatility, B2B suppliers and buyers are taking a fresh look at the rules of engagement.\n\nThis renewed attention on accounts receivable (AR) and accounts payable (AP) points to a new era of trust-building in B2B payments may be emerging, powered by technology, alternative financing tools and an openness to collaboration.\n\nRead more: B2B Firms Are Betting on Time to Cash to Manage Uncertainty\n\nFor much of the last half-century, corporate buyers dictated terms. Large retailers might stretch payments to suppliers for 90 or even 120 days to optimize their own working capital, leaving smaller vendors scrambling to finance operations.\n\nBut the pandemic, global shipping crises and ongoing U.S. tariff escalations have rewritten the script. The once-invisible payment friction became a strategic vulnerability. Delayed payments cascaded into disrupted supply, exposing buyers to inventory shortages and reputational damage. For suppliers, uncertainty about cash inflows made it harder to secure raw materials or invest in production capacity.\n\nPYMNTS Intelligence in the June CAIO Report, \u201cThe Enterprise Reset: Tariffs, Uncertainty and the Limits of Operational Response,\u201d found that 60% of firms reported that they are addressing today\u2019s tariff-induced challenges through tighter partner coordination, smarter sourcing contract terms, more dynamic price modeling and greater alignment between finance and procurement functions.\n\nAt the same time, \u201cThe 2024-2025 Growth Corporates Working Capital Index,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence report commissioned by Visa, found that the integration of suppliers\u2014through digital means, as their billing systems are linked to the buyers\u2019 payment operations\u2014can improve cash flow for both parties, and by extension, create B2B ecosystems that are efficient.\n\nVirtual card platforms are also being adapted for B2B trade. By issuing single-use cards with pre-approved amounts and automatic reconciliation, companies can guarantee payment upon delivery while maintaining tight spend controls.\n\nOn Wednesday (Aug. 13), Visa and B2B payment orchestration platform Bluechain, for example, partnered to enable digital transformation of B2B payments in the U.K.\n\nSee also: How Synthetic Data Is Becoming B2B CFOs\u2019 Secret Weapon\n\nTechnology Is Being Integrated Into B2B Workflows\n\nThe trust-building era in B2B isn\u2019t just a mindset change; it\u2019s also being engineered into the payment process itself. Cloud-based procurement platforms now integrate payment scheduling, financing options and tariff tracking in real time. Both buyer and supplier can see where money is, when it will arrive and how external cost factors might change the plan.\n\nThis transparency is a departure from legacy systems, where payment status was opaque and disputes were resolved by phone or email chains.\n\nOf course, the move toward mutual benefit doesn\u2019t eliminate risk, and there\u2019s also the challenge of ensuring digital tools integrate cleanly with enterprise resource planning systems and comply with local regulations.\n\nAccording to \u201cVirtual Mobility: How Mobile Virtual Cards Elevate B2B Payments,\u201d done in collaboration with WEX, almost 73% of businesses have yet to automate supplier payments, significantly limiting their ability to gain a comprehensive view of money movement.\n\nStill, the alternative of clinging to adversarial terms in a fragile supply chain may carry greater long-term risk. As tariffs, geopolitical shocks and environmental disruptions become more common, the ability to flex payment terms quickly could prove to be a competitive advantage.\n\n\u201cA one-size-fits-all framework can miss the actual risks in a relationship,\u201d Boost Payment Solutions Chief Compliance Officer Elly Aiala told PYMNTS.\n\nThe B2B trust-building trend may only continue to accelerate as generative AI and predictive analytics enhance B2B payment platforms.\n\nIn this vision, payment terms cease to be static clauses and become living agreements that adapt in real time to economic signals. That adaptability could turn payment practices from a source of friction into a driver of resilience.",

      "text": "Cash, after all, is the most objective truth in business. And the cash conversion cycle (CCC), once a back-office metric, is now moving front and center as a health check.\nThe CCC, calculated as the time it takes for a company to convert inventory and other resources into cash from sales, is evolving from a lagging indicator to a real-time performance gauge. Traditionally, it measured the time lag between outlaying cash for operations and receiving cash from customers. Now, it\u2019s becoming the lens through which CFOs view risk, resilience and agility.\nWhat\u2019s changed? In a word: everything.\nSupply chains are more fragmented, vulnerable and in flux; while customer expectations are higher and macroeconomic conditions are less forgiving. High interest rates have raised the cost of capital, while buyers and suppliers are shifting payment behaviors to preserve their own liquidity. That leaves businesses squeezed and needing faster access to cash just to stay in motion.\nThe cash conversion cycle used to be an outcome. Now, it\u2019s a lever.\nRead also: CFOs Reimagine Flow of Funds as Volatility Becomes the Norm\nThe Cash Conversion Cycle as a Strategic Signal\nFor years, companies have obsessed over revenue growth, EBITDA margins and user metrics, a collection of numbers that may look great in board decks but can often say little about underlying health. Liquidity, by contrast, is merciless. In a downturn, it\u2019s the difference between survival and insolvency.\n\u201cCompanies get in trouble in cycles like this, especially if they\u2019re thinly capitalized,\u201d Ingo Payments CEO Drew Edwards told PYMNTS.\nAt the same time, a wave of innovation is transforming how companies manage their money. FinTech platforms, embedded finance tools and real-time payment rails are recoding the DNA of corporate finance, allowing organizations to compress cash cycles, surface insights faster and act with precision.\nYet, according to \u201cVirtual Mobility: How Mobile Virtual Cards Elevate B2B Payments,\u201d done in collaboration with WEX, almost 73% of businesses have yet to automate supplier payments, significantly limiting their ability to gain a comprehensive view of money movement.\n\u201cCash flow is the lifeblood of any corporation,\u201d Abhishek, global head of B2B Acceptance at Visa Commercial Solutions, told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster in an interview posted last month. \u201cIf a payment comes to someone who\u2019s out of the office, on vacation or in meetings, it just sits there and ages. With AR Manager, the moment the payment is received, it\u2019s automatically processed. We\u2019ve seen days sales outstanding (DSO) go down for corporates who\u2019ve moved to this solution.\u201d\nIn today\u2019s landscape, where unpredictability is the only constant, the CCC is increasingly guiding decisions well beyond finance. Pricing strategies, supplier negotiations, fulfillment prioritization, even marketing campaigns are now being stress-tested against cash flow impact.\nIndeed, the traditional components of the CCC \u2014 DSO, DIO (days inventory outstanding), and DPO (days payable outstanding) \u2014 are being reimagined as dials finance leaders can actively tweak, not just passively report on.\nRead more: How CFOs Are Optimizing Their B2B Supply Chains Without AI\nCCC and the Rise of the Intelligent Treasury\nPerhaps the biggest transformation is within treasury itself. Long considered a sleepy, compliance-focused function, corporate treasury is evolving into a strategic command center. Armed with real-time data, machine learning models, and API-enabled platforms, treasurers are now orchestrating liquidity like conductors of a dynamic, ever-shifting financial symphony.\nProgressive companies are now leveraging shortened cash cycles to unlock capital for growth. Faster cash means faster reinvestment, less dependency on external financing, and more agility in capturing new opportunities.\nOf course, modern solutions can require embracing change management in order to implement. Part of the reason CCC has languished in the back office is due to the fragmentation of many firms\u2019 finance functions.\n\u201cPeople used to think the ERP (enterprise resource planning) was the center of the CFO\u2019s office. But the reality is, many large companies that have gone on acquisition sprees have multiple ERP systems, making it difficult to centralize financial data,\u201d Matt Carey, senior vice president, office of the CFO at FIS, told PYMNTS.\nStill, the renaissance of the cash conversion cycle signals a potentially deeper reordering of business priorities. In a world awash in data and drowning in risk, cash isn\u2019t just king, it\u2019s the compass."

      "text": "Virtual Mobility: How Mobile Virtual Cards Elevate B2B Payments\nOutdated payment processes drain time and money, causing delays and errors that disrupt operations. Virtual cards and mobile wallets are transforming B2B payments, offering enhanced security, automation, cash flow visibility and financial incentives for firms seeking to unlock new business efficiencies.\n01\nPaper checks and other outdated payment methods remain prevalent, but their inefficiencies cost businesses valuable time and money. Delays and errors wreak havoc on everyday operations and cash flow.\n02\nVirtual cards bring a powerful combination of security, efficiency and return on investment (ROI) to B2B payments.

Please confirm your email to view all our Trackers.\nLegacy payment methods pose critical challenges for businesses striving to maximize efficiency in an uncertain economic landscape. These challenges take many forms, including payment delays, transaction errors that require correction, and the excessive staffing resources needed to manage paper-based payments.\nSeveral solutions exist to reduce reliance on outdated methods, but few are as promising as business virtual cards. Functioning as digital versions of credit cards, virtual cards can be issued for specific purposes, such as single-use transactions or recurring payments within a set limit. Businesses implementing virtual cards can accelerate payments, strengthen security and automate reconciliation \u2014 especially when used in conjunction with mobile wallets. Additionally, virtual cards often come with financial incentives such as cash-back rewards or rebates, providing an extra boost to a company\u2019s bottom line. By adopting virtual cards, companies can optimize their accounts payable (AP), unlocking efficiencies and gaining better financial visibility to increase cash flow \u2014 all key factors in facilitating growth.\nPaper checks and other outdated payment methods remain prevalent, but their inefficiencies cost businesses valuable time and money. Delays and errors wreak havoc on everyday operations and cash flow.\nCorporates face significant obstacles and inefficiencies with traditional payment systems.\nA recent survey found that nearly 73% of businesses have yet to automate supplier payments, severely limiting their ability to gain a comprehensive view of money movement. The study highlighted substantial challenges with problematic AP processes: 51% of firms reported excessive manual data entry, 47% experienced data errors and process delays, and 23% noted a lack of visibility. These struggles with legacy payment operations prove costly for businesses, underscoring the urgent need for more efficient and automated solutions.\nFinding the optimal mix of payment methods is no easy feat, however. In a recent interview with PYMNTS Intelligence, Eric Frankovic, general manager of corporate payments at WEX, explained that businesses must carefully consider their payment goals, supplier relationships and operational requirements when selecting payment methods. While there is no one-size-fits-all solution, there is a clear need to move away from manual payment methods.\nLate payments are a perpetual problem for small businesses.\nIn Q3 2024 (July to September), small businesses experienced an average payment delay of 9.1 days, resulting in a total payment wait time of 28.7 days. This time frame has remained relatively stable since early 2023, fluctuating between 28.5 and 29.5 days. The 9.1-day average delay in Q3 marks an improvement of 0.5 days from the previous quarter, continuing a positive trend of decreasing payment delays that began in April 2024. However, it is worth noting that September itself saw a slight regression, with payment delays slipping to 10.1 days.\nSuch delays often stem from outdated and inefficient payments systems. Small businesses depend on timely payments to manage payroll and supplier obligations, as they lack the cash reserves of larger firms. Upgrading to more advanced payment methods can significantly improve small firms\u2019 financial stability.\nVirtual Cards Offer a Potent Blend of Security, Efficiency and ROI\nVirtual cards bring a powerful combination of security, efficiency and return on investment (ROI) to B2B payments. By adopting them, companies can streamline AP, enhance fraud protection and unlock lucrative supplier rebates \u2014 all driving business growth and improved cash flow.\nCFOs are adding virtual cards to their payment toolkits.\n14%\nof midmarket firms plan to adopt virtual cards within the next year.\nAccording to a recent PYMNTS Intelligence survey, 14% of companies with annual revenues between $50 million and $1 billion plan to adopt virtual cards within the next 12 months \u2014 a 322% increase compared to the current adoption level. Interest is particularly strong in the media and technology sector, where 28% plan to use them, and in the fleet and mobility sector, where 26% intend to do so.\nVirtual cards offer myriad advantages over other payment methods, particularly in terms of security and efficiency. By generating unique card numbers for each transaction or vendor, they significantly enhance security and reduce the risk of fraud. For instance, if a supplier\u2019s payment system is compromised, the virtual card used cannot be reused elsewhere, safeguarding business accounts and minimizing financial risks. Additionally, virtual cards streamline payment processes by automating tasks such as invoice reconciliation and payment tracking, saving businesses substantial time and money while reducing errors. Another key benefit of virtual cards is the ability to earn rebates, which are essentially cash back or incentives derived from interchange fees. To fully capitalize on these benefits, businesses must cultivate strong supplier relationships, which are crucial for driving virtual card acceptance and maximizing their value within a company\u2019s overall payment strategy.\nWEX and Conferma teamed up to enable virtual cards for SAP invoice software.\nConferma and WEX have partnered to empower SAP\u2019s Concur Invoice users with the ability to pay suppliers using a WEX-issued virtual Mastercard through Conferma\u2019s virtual card platform. This integration allows commercial customers to make payments instantly while leveraging WEX\u2019s credit terms to manage working capital and extend payment timelines. When a supplier submits an invoice, the solution automatically generates a virtual card for the exact amount within Concur Invoice. The system securely provides pre-authorized payment details to the supplier and automatically reconciles the payment against the invoice. According to the press release, this solution accelerates payments, enhances security, eliminates manual tracking of receipts and invoices, avoids cross-border payment fees, and generates rebate revenue. The integration will be available in all markets and currencies supported by WEX.\nVirtual Cards and Mobile Wallets Are Poised to Transform B2B Transactions\nAs businesses look to optimize their payment methods, they are taking a page from the consumer payments playbook by adopting mobile wallets. Adding virtual cards to mobile digital tools elevates payments to a new level of convenience and control.\nDigital wallets continue to dominate the consumer payments landscape.\nA recent survey found that 82% of merchants plan to expand their adoption of digital wallets, while 70% intend to increase their use of open banking and instant bank transfers \u2014 payment methods that align with increasing consumer demand for convenience and security. According to the study, 60% of merchants cited consumer demand for convenience as the primary driver behind their payments innovation efforts.\n82%\nof businesses plan to increase their use of digital walletsin 2025.\nMobile wallets are making waves in B2B payments.\nInevitably, B2B payments are taking their cue from consumer payment trends in the pursuit of speed and convenience. Offering unprecedented flexibility, mobile wallets deliver significant efficiency improvements by minimizing the administrative workload tied to traditional manual payment methods. This approach not only saves time but also reduces costs related to processing fees, paper checks and data entry errors. Moreover, mobile wallets provide businesses with valuable transaction data. Each digital wallet transaction offers insights into customer spending patterns, preferences and payment habits. These insights empower businesses to make more informed decisions, refine marketing strategies and build stronger customer relationships.\nMobile wallets also improve cash flow management. Companies can gain greater financial control by enabling instant payments and real-time account updates, allowing them to allocate resources more effectively. This is particularly advantageous for small to mid-sized businesses (SMBs) that depend on steady cash flow to maintain smooth operations.\nThe Case for Adopting Virtual Cards and Mobile Wallets for B2B Payments\nVirtual credit cards and mobile wallets are revolutionizing B2B payments by offering businesses greater security, efficiency and convenience than legacy payment methods. Each virtual card transaction generates a unique token, protecting sensitive payment information from unauthorized access or fraud. This dynamic security feature eliminates risks associated with static card numbers and centralized databases, which are vulnerable to breaches. Additionally, virtual cards allow businesses to set spending limits, expiration dates and merchant-specific restrictions, providing precise control over expenditures.\nWhen integrated with mobile wallets, virtual cards streamline vendor payments, automate reconciliation and safeguard financial data. Mobile wallets further enhance efficiency by eliminating manual check handling and wire transfers while enabling instant payments. This reduces delays, strengthens supplier relationships and improves cash flow visibility.\nThese solutions integrate seamlessly with AP systems, providing real-time transaction tracking and automated reconciliation. Furthermore, virtual cards embedded in mobile wallets offer detailed reporting, helping businesses optimize expense management and minimize errors. By adopting these tools for B2B payments, companies can enhance operational efficiency, improve financial oversight and meet the growing demand for secure, digital-first transactions.\nAbout\nWEX (NYSE: WEX) is the global commerce platform that simplifies the business of running a business.

      "text": "Fraud in the B2B payments space has gone from the occasional operational hiccup to a persistent, adaptive adversary.\nThe reason? With transaction volumes and values dwarfing those in the consumer space, B2B payments have become an obvious target for fraudsters whose tactics have evolved in sophistication as quickly as digital commerce itself.\n\u201cB2B is especially vulnerable or especially high stakes because of the higher transaction amounts and volumes,\u201d Boost Payment Solutions Chief Compliance Officer Elly Aiala said during a discussion hosted by PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster. \u201cIn the B2C world, there can be compromises of the lower amount, but in the B2B world, a lot more is at stake.\u201d\nThat concentration of value makes the stakes existential. A single breach can mean millions of dollars in unrecoverable losses, reputational damage and long-term erosion of partner trust.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sort of like, why do people rob banks? Because that\u2019s where the money is,\u201d Webster said. \u201cWhy is there such B2B fraud? That\u2019s where a lot of the money is.\u201d\nThe problem isn\u2019t just the money at stake, but the systems fraudsters can exploit, like complex payment chains, legacy infrastructure and slow-moving institutional processes. Without constant review and retraining, even well-intentioned safeguards become blind spots for exploitation.\nInstitutions \u201ccan be a little bit slower to change,\u201d Aiala said, adding that inertia can ultimately be a fraudster\u2019s greatest ally.\nThe High Stakes of B2B Fraud\nThe B2B payments risk profile is compounded by its endemic operational complexity. Multistep approval chains, regulatory oversight and entrenched systems mean fraudulent activity can slip through unnoticed until after money is gone.\nThe first line of defense is building compliance into the architecture of products and services, not bolting it on later, Aiala said.\n\u201cIt really comes down to how your infrastructure is built,\u201d she said. \u201cThe best companies are continuously reevaluating their risks.\u201d\nIn cybersecurity terms, a \u201cthreat vector\u201d is any path an attacker might use to infiltrate a system, she said. For B2B payments, that path could be a compromised vendor onboarding process, a weak authentication method or a single employee tricked by a well-crafted phishing email.\nWhen Webster asked what \u201creducing the threat vector\u201d means in practice, Aiala described a tailored, data-driven approach.\n\u201cThe first step is really looking at how you are operationally performing your products and services, your internal controls,\u201d she said. \u201cDoes that match up with your policy and procedures? Does that match up with what you\u2019re seeing in patterns in transactions?\u201d\nFor example, if a certain merchant category code (MCC) is onboarding at an unusual rate, compliance needs to ensure controls are in place to manage the associated risks and guarantee that day-to-day operations adhere to those controls.\nThe approach is tailored, not templated.\n\u201cA one-size-fits-all framework can miss the actual risks in a relationship,\u201d Aiala said.\nTurning Compliance Into a Business Enabler\nPayments innovation is accelerating toward instant settlement. Real-time rails are becoming standard domestically, while stablecoins and other blockchain-based methods promise to move money across borders in seconds.\nFor compliance leaders, this speed poses a paradox. The decision to adopt faster payment methods should weigh customer demand for immediacy against the recoverability of funds in case of fraud.\nBoost has researched stablecoin settlement for years, but Aiala said caution is key.\n\u201cWe need to continually evaluate options and understand traceability, financial crime exposure, compliance and recoverability,\u201d she said.\n\u201cSpeed plus the irreversible nature of crypto transactions can be daunting,\u201d she added. While blockchain payments are traceable, \u201ctraceable doesn\u2019t always mean recoverable.\u201d\nTechnology alone can\u2019t seal every gap. The weakest link is often a human being making a split-second decision. In an era where artificial intelligence can generate convincing executive impersonations, the potential for social engineering at scale is higher than ever. The same data-rich systems that detect fraud must also be safeguarded against misuse.\nAgainst this backdrop, a troubling trend is compliance programs that look sophisticated on paper but fail in practice, Aiala said.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want your program to be pure optics or \u2018check the box,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen programs so overly robust they\u2019re not catered to the actual risk of the relationship.\u201d\nThe prescription is more frequent, targeted check-ins and genuine education over sprawling, once-a-year audits, she said\n\u201cIt ends up being a business enabler, and it helps our partners understand why Boost\u2019s threat landscape is so small,\u201d she said.\nThe Playbook for Reducing B2B Payment Fraud\nBoost\u2019s proprietary platforms, such as Boost Intercept and Boost 100, were designed with transaction integrity as a core principle, not an afterthought.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019ve had zero fraud losses to date,\u201d Aiala said.\nIn a sector where transactions are measured in millions and reputations are built on trust, the stakes are high. The compliance war room is no longer a back-office function; it\u2019s a command center for corporate resilience.\n\u201cA transaction should happen at the right place, at the right time, with the right parties,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how commerce happens.\u201d\nAiala said her framework for shrinking the attack surface blends technology, process discipline and culture. She recommended building security in from day one to avoid retrofitting controls; continuously reviewing processes by moving from annual audits to more frequent risk reviews; empowering employees to speak up by making fraud reporting culturally safe; tailoring controls to the risks by avoiding one-size-fits-all frameworks; and balancing speed with recoverability by evaluating trade-offs in payments innovations.\nIn the era of AI-driven fraud, instant payments and complex global supply chains, embracing a compliance-first framework may be the most valuable asset a B2B payments company can have.\nFor all PYMNTS B2B coverage, subscribe to the daily B2B Newsletter."

      "text": "With the U.S. on Thursday (July 10) threatening additional tariffs of up to 50% on countries like Brazil and materials like copper, the operational migraine that keeping up with each new announcement brings doesn\u2019t appear to be going away any time soon.\nAnd while some businesses are implicitly embracing the TACO (the acronym being used for \u201cTrump always chickens out\u201d) trade and counting on the administration ultimately backing down, the most forward thinking B2B firms are betting on time to cash mastery by treating liquidity not just as a financial metric but as a dynamic business asset.\nTime to cash (T2C) is a strategic framework that reimagines how enterprises manage the end-to-end flow of money \u2014 from invoice issuance to final reconciliation in the bank account. More than a narrow look at days sales outstanding (DSO), T2C spans revenue realization, disbursement strategy, working capital optimization and the underlying technology stack that enables it all.\nFor chief financial officers (CFOs), that means moving beyond static cash flow reports toward a more real-time, predictive and action-oriented model. Time to cash isn\u2019t just a reporting concern; it\u2019s becoming a core strategic differentiator. Companies that can both accelerate inflows and intelligently manage outflows may be able to enjoy a material advantage in volatility by reinvesting faster, borrowing less and pivoting with precision.\nRead more: How B2B Payments Data Turns Customer Retention Into a Growth Strategy\nThe CFO as Ecosystem Architect\nTime to cash is not new\u2014it\u2019s the cousin of \u201corder to cash\u201d (O2C), a well-established supply chain and finance process. But what\u2019s different today is how holistic and strategic it\u2019s become. Time to cash now encompasses lead qualification, contracting, fulfillment, invoicing, collections and even embedded finance. Every department, from marketing to customer success, is being evaluated on its ability to reduce friction and latency.\n\u201cHow long is the invoice in the building?\u201d Edenred Pay CFO Joe Denson told PYMNTS during a discussion about payables automation. \u201cIdeally, you\u2019re measuring handling time in minutes, not days. How many people are involved? Fewer is better, as long as separation of duties and controls are preserved. And can I get the data in a way that\u2019s sortable and manageable? \u2026 AP automation allows finance staff to stop doing manual tasks like entering invoices or looking up suppliers.\u201d\nTo help with identifying where businesses sit currently, Visa and PYMNTS Intelligence created a dynamic benchmarking report that can help users take a deeper look into how their DPO (days payable outstanding) and other metrics stack up against peers and outperformers within their chosen industries.\nThe sales-to-cash cycle remains an operational blind spot in many organizations. But finance teams are beginning to assert more control by partnering with sales, credit and collections to streamline invoicing, reduce disputes and better segment customers by risk profile.\nAutomation also plays a key role here. Intelligent accounts receivable (AR) systems can tailor outreach based on customer behavior, apply payments at the invoice level and trigger dynamic collections workflows. When orchestrated well, revenue realization becomes a repeatable engine, not a firefighting exercise.\nSee also: For CFOs, the Tech Stack Is the Business Strategy\nLiquidity Becomes a Competitive Weapon\nTechnology alone doesn\u2019t drive velocity. What distinguishes high-performing firms is a cash-first culture. One that embeds liquidity awareness into daily operations across sales, procurement and operations.\nIn these organizations, cash conversion is a shared KPI. Deal desk terms are evaluated for DSO impact. Procurement teams balance cost and payment terms in tandem. Inventory is managed with liquidity, not just logistics, in mind.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of change going on, and it all centers around working capital,\u201d David Bork, senior vice president, Boost 100 Business Development at Boost Payment Solutions, told PYMNTS.\nStill, PYMNTS Intelligence data has found that tariffs and other supply chain disruptions have forced most middle-market U.S. goods and retail companies into reactive mode. This can result in payments staying stuck in last century, with paper checks and manual data entry still common elements of accounts receivable.\nPYNTS Intelligence has also found that when it comes to cash flow, security and convenience, virtual cards offer AP and AR departments a suite of advantages. At the end of the day, B2B companies want a simple, secure, consumer-like digital payments experience, Greg Castro, president of PayTrace by North, writes in a new PYMNTS eBook, \u201cHalftime 2025: Charting the Future of Payments.\u201d"

      "text": "What happens when large companies face disruption in the global business environment but are uncertain about how it might unfold and how long it will last? If they\u2019re enterprise-level goods and retailers in the United States, most don\u2019t rush to replace their foreign suppliers with domestic ones, for a start.\nU.S. business leaders are now making hard decisions as U.S. tariffs on imports undergo significant fluctuations and overseas supply chains come under strain. Still, hardly any are rejiggering their operations to make them U.S.-based and dependent on American materials and supplies. Instead of reshoring\u2014a goal of the Trump administration\u2019s trade agenda to bring American manufacturing home\u2014they\u2019re negotiating with suppliers, cutting overhead costs and raising prices. That suggests they\u2019re betting that the current back-and-forth of the tariffs regime will ultimately result in more favorable (for them) trade deals or lower-than-proposed levies. This stance resembles the \u201cTACO\u201d (\u201cTrump always chickens out\u201d) view held by many investors who share the same sentiment. PYMNTS Intelligence research shows that most firms are reacting to the shifting global trade war with a wait-and-see approach that\u2019s focused on near-term responses, not long-term structural changes.\nThese are just some findings from \u201cThe Enterprise Reset: Tariffs, Uncertainty and the Limits of Operational Response,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence study. Data was collected from a survey of 60 CFOs\u2014each representing a U.S. company generating at least $1 billion in annual revenue\u2014that was conducted May 6, 2025, through May 16, 2025.\nThe \u201cTACO\u201d Mindset\nMarkets call it the \u201cTACO\u201d trade\u2014Trump Always Chickens Out. The phrase captures investor skepticism that sweeping tariffs will fully materialize as currently laid out for the long haul. Leaders of enterprise companies appear to be applying a similar logic as they assess how to respond and make tactical changes in the present.\nJust 5.9% of firms in May reported reshoring their foreign suppliers, down from 9.1% the month before. Roughly one in three (35%) enterprises surveyed said they might diversify their international suppliers. This share is down from 45% who said the same in April. The share of companies that have already made that move rose to 29% in May from 26% a month earlier.\nNearly all (96%) of goods and retail firms\u2014the sector most directly impacted by tariffs\u2014say the levies present a chance to support the U.S. economy. Eight in 10 of those companies say tariffs will free up financial resources to invest in innovation.\nCFOs make short-term fixes as tariff uncertainty continues.\nBut those widespread beliefs aren\u2019t driving investment. What they are driving is short-term tactical responses intended to cope with uncertainty now. More than nine in 10 goods and retail companies identified negative impacts associated with tariffs. These include planning challenges and higher costs for reconfiguring their supply chains. Nearly seven in 10 (69%) fear that retaliatory tariffs from major trading partners, including Canada, China, Mexico and the European Union, will harm their exports. The findings reveal a disconnect between what large companies claim is possible and what they are actually doing on the ground, as well as their expectations for the future. This thesis aligns with PYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s analysis showing that 94% of enterprise CFOs in goods have not attempted reshoring. Like other firms, these retailers are making defensive adjustments designed to buy time while the global trade war unfolds.\nThe survey data indicate that companies are opting for margin management over significant structural changes. Just over one in two CFOs say they are likely to raise prices in response to tariffs. Nearly three in 10 report having already done so (28%). Thirty-five percent have cut operational costs, including employee salaries, while 72% say further cuts are possible. These tactical adjustments significantly outpace structural ones. Just 10% of enterprises reported redesigning their products to use different materials in May, down from 27% in April.\nIn other words, enterprises don\u2019t appear to be acting like tariffs at their current levels are here to stay. Instead, they seem to be hoping to run out the clock. That\u2019s the TACO mindset: Make tactical moves in the short term to survive without betting on a future that may never arrive.\nTariff Uncertainty Is Universal\u2014But Action Is Cautious\nThe actions enterprises have taken so far reflect their current assessments of the impact of tariffs today. In the goods sector, 89% of CFOs say the duties are expected to have a mostly or entirely negative effect on their business finances. Just 3.8% see any upside. That contrast becomes sharper across sectors. In services, which are likely to be indirectly affected by tariffs through shifts in spending and other spillover macroeconomic effects, only 27% expect a negative impact. Interestingly, in technology, none do. In fact, 58% of tech CFOs believe tariffs will have a mostly or entirely positive effect. This is possibly due to their reliance on outsourced labor for coding and software development, an area not impacted by tariffs.\nIn the technology sector, the lack of immediate cost exposure likely allows firms to maintain flexibility. Their posture can be more opportunistic, rather than reactive. The bifurcation is structural: CFOs of firms dependent on physical goods and cross-border sourcing experience tariffs as a financial drag. Companies built around services or software are less likely to.\nYet for the average enterprise, the difference isn\u2019t abstract\u2014it\u2019s concrete and operational. Surveyed firms have responded with cost cuts, supplier renegotiations, hiring freezes and pricing changes. More than half are negotiating with suppliers for better pricing. Over three in 10 are leveraging just-in-time inventory. Nearly one-third are reducing their operational costs, and nearly four in 10 anticipate potential hiring freezes or layoffs. These actions, taken under pressure, are less signs of permanent, long-term transformation and more signs of coping in the near term.\nSupply Chain Overhauls Remain on Pause Due to Tariff Uncertainty\nTrue, goods firms expect near-term disruption. Eighty-four percent of goods sector CFOs say they expect shortages or delays in getting products this year. At the same time, 72% expect that to happen in the next three to 12 months. Two-thirds expect raw material costs to rise during this period. Fewer than one in four believe their firms will enhance their supply chain resilience within a year.\nThe timeline to rebuild is long. Among goods firms, 61% say resilience improvements could take up to three years\u2014a period that bumps up the end of President Trump\u2019s second term. Services firms show a similar lag: More than eight in 10 expect higher costs and 67% expect shortages, but only half foresee supply chain gains within 12 months. The technology sector is an interesting outlier: 100% of companies expect higher input costs and 75% expect shortages. Just 30% say resilience will arrive within the next three months, with eight in 10 expecting that within the next 12 months. In short, firms are being asked to make long-term decisions on a dime. Next to none are taking big risks around these choices.\nEven where firms see a long-term upside, near-term action remains rare. Notably, six in 10 goods and retail firms say tariffs are a chance to support the U.S. economy; eight in 10 tech firms say the same.\nIn nearly every sector, action on supply chain transformation trails behind expectations of cost pressure and delay. The outcome is a playbook of temporary margin management\u2014price increases, cost cuts, renegotiations\u2014not structural redesign.\nRead More\nPYMNTS Intelligence is the leading provider of information on the trends driving executive decisions in response to U.S. tariff policies.

      "text": "The utilization of working capital solutions is on the rise. In fact, 80% of Growth Corporates using at least one such solution in 2024, is up 13% year over year. In addition, PYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s research finds significant improvements in working capital efficiency among Growth Corporates in 2024. This efficiency gain is largely attributed to better cash visibility and optimized use of working capital solutions.\nThe preference for on-demand solutions, such as corporate and virtual cards and bank lines of credit, has surged. This is especially evident in regions and industries with high operational efficiency. However, challenges in accessing these solutions persist. The impacts are particularly felt among firms in Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa (CEMEA) and in industries like commercial travel and media and technology, where slow approvals and suboptimal options are prevalent.\nThe most efficient Growth Corporates \u2014 which we labeled top performers \u2014 leveraged flexible and strategic working capital solutions. As a result, they achieved 51% shorter cash conversion cycles. They also averaged savings of $11 million in bottom-line benefits from reduced interest, inventory carrying costs, and supplier discounts. Top performers tend to use working capital strategically. They deploy working capital solutions to cover predictable cash flow gaps or to invest in business growth.\nThese are some of the findings explored in \u201cThe 2024-2025 Growth Corporates Working Capital Index,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence report commissioned by Visa. This edition examines the business conditions and working capital requirements of 1,297 CFOs and Treasurers across eight industry segments, five global regions and 23 countries. It draws on an in-depth quantitative and qualitative survey of firms with annual revenue between $50 million and $1 billion, conducted between May 21 and July 9.\nInside \u201cThe 2024-2025 Growth Corporates Working Capital Index\u201d:\n- How Growth Corporates across 23 countries use external working capital\n- How cash flow visibility enables more strategic uses of external working capital\n- How top performers in the Working Capital Index achieved an average of $11 million in bottom-line benefits\n- The role of external working capital in improving buyer-supplier relationships\n- The working capital solutions Growth Corporates wished their bankers offered\n- The pain points Growth Corporates experience when using external working capital solutions\nThis report includes crucial information for the firms that drive local, regional and global economies.

      "text": "Traditional forecasting models and predictive analytics are breaking down under the weight of unprecedented variability, whether from tariffs, geopolitical shocks or macro dynamism. The ongoing strain on old data is forcing forward-thinking chief financial officers to turn to a new tool: data that doesn\u2019t exist yet.\nSynthetic data, or artificially generated data that mimics the statistical properties of real-world information, is gaining favor among predictive analytics teams in B2B organizations. Once a niche tool in academic artificial intelligence research and spear-tip areas like self-driving car simulations, synthetic data has crossed over into finance, where it is helping to reshape areas like treasury strategy, liquidity planning and supply chain resilience.\nB2B companies, challenged by lumpy revenue patterns, seasonal working capital cycles, and limited historical visibility in new markets, are especially ripe for this shift. Unlike consumer-facing firms, which can draw on vast lakes of behavioral data, B2B finance teams often lack the volume and granularity needed to build resilient predictive models.\nFor example, finance teams can turn to synthetic data pipelines to simulate market swings, anticipate supplier default scenarios, and visualize cash flow risks before they materialize. These scenario planning capabilities are commonly repeatable and scalable.\nRead also: Payment Data Is Back-Office Automation\u2019s Hidden Gold Mine\nSynthetic Data Moves From Silicon Valley to the CFO Suite\nSynthetic data was initially popularized by AI labs and tech firms using it to train computer vision systems and natural language models. But as the uncertain operating landscape puts new pressures on traditional forecasting methods, demand for alternative data sources is spilling over into corporate finance.\nBy programmatically generating thousands of plausible but non-identical datasets \u2014 each aligned with real-world statistical characteristics \u2014 companies can simulate how their businesses might perform under high-stress conditions. These include foreign exchange shocks, supplier shutdowns, port congestions and cyberattacks.\n\u201c[Accounts receivable (AR)] is no longer about settling the past. It\u2019s about predicting the future of cash,\u201d Pamela Novoa Ralli, head of product management at FIS, told PYMNTS in an interview published Tuesday (Aug. 5). \u201cIt\u2019s moving from a responsive to a proactive view.\u201d\n\u201cAI allows predictability features to be at the core of the AR solution, instead of what we have seen in the last 10 years, which is about looking at the past and focusing on efficiency and effectiveness of the current state,\u201d she added.\nFor treasury teams managing billions of dollars in cash, even small blind spots in data visibility can have large consequences. This is where synthetic data may end up proving transformative.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more important to the treasurer than preserving and understanding where their cash is,\u201d Tom Durkin, global product head of CashPro in Global Payments Solutions at Bank of America, told PYMNTS in an interview published Monday (Aug. 4), adding that people traditionally have used a spreadsheet to forecast, and that could take up to a week to complete.\nBy the time it\u2019s done, the data is out of date.\nThe PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cWhy Treasurers\u2019 Influence Matters\u201d found that treasurers with high levels of influence are more likely to report that their companies have predictable cash flows, expect revenue to increase and are agile in responding to shifting market conditions.\nSee also: With Trade War Back on, CFOs and Product Chiefs Reset and Reboot\nAccelerating the Shift From Reactive to Predictive Finance\nThe ripple effects of synthetic data are also poised to reshape how CFOs collaborate with operations and procurement leaders. Amid rising supply chain fragility, finance teams are tasked with not just tracking costs \u2014 but actively shaping the network architecture.\nSynthetic data, for example, also allows firms to test the resilience of just-in-time and just-in-case inventory models across divergent futures \u2014 something historical data, by definition, cannot do.\nIn regulated sectors, synthetic data also helps avoid data privacy risks. Because the data doesn\u2019t map to real individuals or firms, it can be used to train AI models without violating GDPR, HIPAA or other data protection laws \u2014 making it especially attractive for financial services and healthcare firms.\nBut while synthetic data promises great upside, it also has challenges. The primary concern is fidelity. If the generative models are poorly trained, they can produce unrealistic or misleading outputs.\nFor all PYMNTS B2B coverage, subscribe to the daily B2B Newsletter."

      "text": "American enterprises are under pressure. Between renewed tariff hikes, global supply chain instability and rising operational costs, many firms face decision points that could shape their futures.\nAnd that can put the finance team in the hot seat, or command center, depending on the business.\nYet the response from large enterprises to today\u2019s ongoing macro uncertainty and supply-chain challenges, according to new research from PYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s June 2025 CAIO Report, \u201cThe Enterprise Reset: Tariffs, Uncertainty and the Limits of Operational Response,\u201d is not one of sweeping transformation but of strategic hesitation.\nThe report found that a minority of companies, fewer than 6%, are taking bold steps like reshoring manufacturing or redesigning products in light of tariff and trade turbulence. Instead, most are opting for temporary cost-cutting, incremental pricing changes and cautious contract renegotiations.\nThe backdrop to this cautious recalibration is a volatile trade environment. From semiconductor restrictions to energy tariffs, the global business landscape is being reshaped not by market forces but by regulatory chess matches.\nEnterprises now confront a set of \u201cknown unknowns\u201d: rising tariff threats, supply bottlenecks and sudden price spikes. It\u2019s at this nexus where operational discipline, financial data and focused resilience are shaping a smarter, more deliberate transformation.\nTariffs, Tension and Tactical Thinking\nThe PYMNTS Intelligence report data found that nearly all firms (96%) say tariffs have negatively impacted their operations, and 84% cite persistent shortages as an ongoing challenge. Yet, fewer than 1 in 4 (23%) plan to make long-term operational changes in the next year.\nAt first glance, it may seem irrational for companies to not reconfigure their supply chains or rethink their cost structures in the face of prolonged uncertainty. But the truth is more nuanced. Moving a major supplier or changing a production site, for example, isn\u2019t like flipping a switch. It involves compliance reviews, customer approvals and major capital expenditure.\nAt the same time, any executives are betting that tariffs are temporary. There\u2019s a belief \u2014 hope, even \u2014 that cooler heads will prevail and mitigate aggressive trade stances. Additionally, despite years of digitization talk, many companies may still lack the real-time visibility needed to confidently make cross-border structural decisions.\nSo, what are companies doing? A majority of firms (60%) surveyed report they are addressing these challenges through tighter partner coordination, smarter sourcing contract terms, more dynamic price modeling and greater alignment between finance and procurement functions.\nRead the report: The Enterprise Reset: Tariffs, Uncertainty and the Limits of Operational Response\nThe Emerging Strategic Model of Discipline as Growth Center\nIn this vein, firms are leveraging internal data, including procurement and payment analytics, to monitor supplier performance and maintain operational continuity without upending established workflows. Many firms are prioritizing improvements to existing systems to avoid unnecessary complexity.\nMore than half of surveyed enterprises are renegotiating supplier and logistics terms to gain pricing leverage and reduce exposure. The report found that technology investment is rising, particularly in systems that offer better visibility into cash flow, vendor risk and procurement performance.\nThese adjustments reflect a deeper integration between finance, operations and procurement functions \u2014 something many organizations accelerated during the pandemic and are now institutionalizing.\nThe findings from report suggest a broader shift underway: the emergence of a strategic model that prioritizes real-time insight, cross-functional alignment and controlled responsiveness. Rather than pursuing large, immediate transformation, organizations are building resilience through readiness \u2014 preparing the groundwork for change, but executing with discipline.\nUltimately, today\u2019s tactical posture is not a sign of delay, but preparation. Many enterprises are using this period of uncertainty to sharpen their internal capabilities and modernize systems, so they are better positioned for more transformative moves in the future."
