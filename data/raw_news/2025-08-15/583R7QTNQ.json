  "title": "Heavy Savings, Light Mouse: 33% Off Razer Viper V2 Pro Gaming Mouse",
  "description": "A lightweight mouse can be advantageous during gaming sessions, giving you the clutch you need to close out a match. You can grab the Razer Viper V2 Pro gaming mouse for $50 less right now.",
  "content": "While some gaming mice offer extra buttons that could weigh them down, others remain minimalistic, like the Razer Viper V2 Pro. As a result, its lightweight size provides a degree of speed and control that others can't match. Now, you can grab it for $50 less at Newegg. For a deal under $100, you definitely don't want to miss out on it.\n\nBilled as a successor to Razer's Viper Ultimate mouse , the V2 Pro is 20% lighter. Its built-in grips, right side buttons, and RGB were removed to give gamers more efficiency and speed. It also touts a 25% faster connection than other conventional gaming mice. This will help players reduce latency and increase responsiveness, giving them a crucial advantage. With up to 80 hours of battery life, the V2 Pro makes sure that your gaming sessions won't be interrupted. A quality gaming mouse can make the difference between victory and defeat in games like Overwatch 2 and Valorant.\n\nOur hardware writer, Zachary Cuevas, awarded it an \"Excellent\" rating. In our Razer Viper V2 Pro review , he said, \"Tons of small changes morph the Razer Viper V2 Pro gaming mouse into a perfect match for esports players looking for the lightest and fastest controller.\"\n\nBe sure to also check out our other and .\n\nMore Computer Mice Deals on\n\nMore Computer Mice Deals on\n\nMore Computer Mice Deals on",
