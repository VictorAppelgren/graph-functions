  "content": "Parnassus Investments, an investment management firm that focuses on owning a concentrated portfolio of U.S. large cap stocks, released its Parnassus Value Equity Fund second-quarter 2025 investor letter. The full letter is available for download here. For the second quarter of 2025, the fund reported a net return of 7.24%, outperforming its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Value Index, which returned 3.79% for the same period. The fund\u2019s top 5 holdings are also listed in the letter, showing the firm\u2019s main investment positions heading into 2025.\n\nOne of the companies mentioned in the letter is Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) engages in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, eCommerce websites, and mobile applications. Over the past month, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) rose by 8.90%, and its shares gained 50.92% of their value over the last 12 months. On August 12, 2025, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) shares closed at $103.62, with a market capitalization of $826.93 billion.\n\nHere is what they have to say about Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in their investor letter:\n\n\"In addition to being a leading traditional brick-and-mortar retailer, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is an omnichannel/e-commerce leader, driven by significant digital investments that unlocked alternative business streams such as advertising, membership, fulfillment, data and marketplace services that help to fortify and grow margins in the longer term. The company\u2019s market share has grown and is expected to continue rising as it maintains competitive pricing and increases e-commerce penetration. Despite exposure to tariff and macroeconomic risks, Walmart\u2019s unparalleled scale provides significant leverage in price negotiations with vendors and suppliers, thereby reinforcing its value proposition.\"\n\nIs it a Wise Move to Invest in Walmart Inc. (WMT)?\n\nWalmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is not included in our list of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds. According to our data,\n\n100 hedge fund portfolios held positions in Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) at the end of the first quarter of 2025, down from\n\n116 in the previous quarter. WMT surpassed earnings expectations, posting an EPS of $0.61 compared to the forecast of $0.575. While we acknowledge the potential of WMT as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk. If you're looking for an extremely undervalued AI stock that also stands to benefit significantly from Trump-era tariffs and the onshoring trend, see our free report on the best short-term AI stock.",

      "text": "There\u2019s a once-in-a-generation convergence happening right now. Three unstoppable megatrends are reshaping the global economy\u2014and one under-the-radar stock is perfectly positioned to profit from all of them.\nThis isn\u2019t a flashy AI stock or a speculative play. It\u2019s the infrastructure backbone of the future\u2014and it\u2019s trading at a bargain.\nLet me explain.\nTrend #1: The AI Arms Race\nArtificial intelligence is the most transformational force since the steam engine\u2014and it\u2019s just getting started.\nBut behind every ChatGPT prompt and robotic breakthrough is something few investors are thinking about:\nPower. Lots of it.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning: \u201cAI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nWhile investors pile into chip stocks with sky-high valuations, this company is quietly supplying the electricity that makes AI possible. No matter who wins the AI race\u2014Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta\u2014this company gets paid.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #2: Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Could Trigger a U.S. LNG Export Boom\nDonald Trump has made one thing clear: he\u2019s coming back to renegotiate global trade\u2014on America\u2019s terms.\nHis top priority? Narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. And this time, he\u2019s not just targeting Chinese imports\u2014he\u2019s taking aim at every trade partner who\u2019s been running a surplus at America\u2019s expense.\nTrump\u2019s team is already working behind the scenes to revise trade deals with Japan, Europe, and South Korea. And while the media focuses on tariffs and quotas, savvy investors are watching where the real money will flow:\nInto American LNG.\nHere\u2019s why: The U.S. is sitting on a massive glut of natural gas\u2014thanks to the shale boom. Domestic prices are near historic lows, while Europe and parts of Asia are paying 3\u20135x more for the same fuel. It\u2019s the perfect imbalance.\nAnd Trump knows it.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s pressuring our trading partners to buy American energy as part of future trade agreements. It\u2019s a simple way to cut the trade deficit without slapping tariffs on U.S. consumers.\nThat sets the stage for a massive wave of U.S. LNG exports, backed by political momentum and international demand.\nNow here\u2019s where our stock comes in\u2026\nOur stock is a tollbooth operator in this booming sector. This company builds the infrastructure that makes LNG exports possible\u2014the pipelines, terminals, and systems that physically move U.S. gas to global buyers.\nIf Trump succeeds in tying LNG purchases to trade deals\u2014and all signs suggest he will\u2014this company will be printing money on every contract signed. The more the world buys American gas, the more this company earns.\nAnd this isn\u2019t some hypothetical \u201cif.\u201d The groundwork is already being laid:\n- Europe is scrambling to replace Russian gas permanently.\n- Japan is actively sourcing non-Chinese, non-Russian LNG.\n- India and South Korea are deepening energy ties with the U.S.\n- New terminals are being planned and permitted in anticipation of the coming surge.\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats may dominate the headlines\u2014but his behind-the-scenes LNG diplomacy could be the real financial windfall for U.S. energy companies.\nAnd our pick is sitting in the perfect spot to benefit.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #3: The Great Onshoring Boom\u2014And the $9 Billion Clue in Indiana\nFor decades, America offshored its industrial base. Now, that trend is reversing\u2014and fast.\nFrom semiconductors to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing is coming back to U.S. soil. Rising geopolitical tensions, Trump-era tariffs, and global supply chain shocks have forced companies to rethink their entire operating models. The result? A tidal wave of onshoring\u2014and our stock is riding it like a pro.\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Lebanon, Indiana.\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is investing $9 billion into two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at the LEAP Lebanon Innovation and Research District. This is one of the largest life sciences manufacturing investments in U.S. history\u2014and it\u2019s not a one-off.\nOur company\u2014a global leader in engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM)\u2014has already been awarded a $3.2 billion contract for this project. That\u2019s not a preliminary deal. This is full notice to proceed. Shovels are in the ground. Steel is going up. Money is already flowing.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nThe Lilly project is a bellwether for what\u2019s coming: dozens of similar large-scale facilities across the country, spanning sectors from biotech to clean energy to advanced manufacturing. Each one will require complex infrastructure, deep engineering know-how, and flawless execution.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our company delivers.\nThis isn\u2019t speculative future revenue. This is high-margin, long-duration, politically supported work\u2014backed by blue-chip clients and megatrends. And as more companies race to bring operations home, our stock is in the pole position to win contract after contract.\nn fact, you can think of it this way:\nWherever America rebuilds its industrial backbone, this company gets paid.\nIt\u2019s not just an AI play. It\u2019s not just an energy play. It\u2019s also the ultimate onshoring pick-and-shovel stock\u2014a contractor to the next American manufacturing supercycle.\nAnd while Wall Street focuses on headlines, smart investors are loading up on the company quietly collecting billion-dollar checks behind the scenes.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nBuilt for the Future: Zero Debt, Cash to Deploy, and AI in Its Sights\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.\nAnd that\u2019s for a business tied to:\n- The AI infrastructure supercycle\n- The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs\n- A surge in U.S. LNG exports\n- And a unique footprint in nuclear energy\u2014the future of clean, reliable power\nYou simply won\u2019t find another AI and energy stock this cheap\u2026 with this much upside.\nThis isn\u2019t a hype stock.

Welcome to Walmart\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal Year 2026 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Steph Wissink, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Steph, you may begin.\nSteph Wissink: Thank you. Welcome, everyone. We appreciate you joining us and your interest in Walmart. Joining me today from our home office in Bentonville are Walmart\u2019s CEO, Doug McMillon; and CFO, John David Rainey. Doug and John David will first share their views on the quarter, and then we\u2019ll open up the line for your questions. During the question-and-answer portion, we will be joined by our segment CEOs, John Furner from Walmart U.S., Kath McLay from Walmart International, and Chris Nicholas from Sam\u2019s Club. For additional detail on our results, including highlights by segment, please see our earnings release and accompanying presentation on our website. We will make every effort to answer as many of your questions as we can in the hour we have scheduled for this call.\nAs a courtesy to others, please limit yourself to one question. Today\u2019s call is being recorded, and management may make forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the factors identified in our filings with the SEC. Please review our press release and accompanying slide presentation for a cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements, as well as our entire safe harbor and non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at stock.walmart.com. Doug, that concludes my intro. We\u2019re ready to begin.\nDoug McMillon: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. I\u2019ll start today by thanking our associates. They continue to drive results for today, while changing to strengthen our business for tomorrow. We have more than 475,000 associates participating in our Walmart Share Purchase Plan, and 81% of them are hourly. For all those associates that are listening, nice job, everybody. For our first quarter, we grew sales 4% and profit by 3% in constant currency. We grew International sales by 7.8%. We drove a Sam\u2019s U.S. comp of 6.7%, excluding fuel, and a Walmart U.S. comp of 4.5%. Though strong Q1 results were not driven by inflation, transactions and units drove our top line. Globally, we grew eCommerce 22% with each segment delivering growth of at least 20%.\nInventory is in good shape. So the first quarter was what we expected on the top line and better than what we expected on the bottom line. It was a good first quarter. There\u2019s a lot to like about how we\u2019re changing and where we are. We feel great about our team, our strategy and our stores and clubs. We feel great about how we\u2019re driving eCommerce growth in a way that not only serves customers and members better, but reshapes our business model, resulting in a more profitable business with higher returns over time. Delivery speed continues to help drive our business. We\u2019ll soon reach 95% of the population in the U.S. with delivery options of three hours or less. For Walmart U.S., the number of deliveries in less than three hours grew by 91% for Q1 versus a year ago.\nAnd in China and India, we\u2019re frequently talking about delivery times that happen in minutes. We\u2019re confident in our ability to strengthen this business even as we navigate cost of goods changes. Our short and longer-term opportunities are clear. The immediate challenge is obviously navigating the impact of tariffs here in the U.S. Our mindset and approach haven\u2019t changed since our investor conference last month in Dallas. I want to thank President Trump and Secretary Bessent for the progress made recently. We\u2019re hopeful that it leads to a longer term agreement between the U.S. and China that would result in even lower tariffs. We will do our best to keep our prices as low as possible. But given the magnitude of the tariffs, even at the reduced levels announced this week, we aren\u2019t able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins.\nIn retail, managing inventory is always important. In this situation, it\u2019s even more important and even more challenging. It\u2019s helpful that we\u2019re entering the second quarter with well managed inventory. It\u2019s helpful that we\u2019re crossing the threshold of profitability with eCommerce globally and that we have these newer, higher margin businesses growing like membership and advertising. It\u2019s helpful that we sell a broad assortment that includes food, consumables and general merchandise. It\u2019s helpful that so much of our assortment is replenishable, which means we can flow it. We don\u2019t have to make a onetime call on a quantity. Instead we can adjust a forecast and partner with our suppliers to adjust quantities over time as we navigate tariff impacts on costs.\nIt\u2019s helpful that we have so many talented and experienced merchants and replenishment associates. Treating our suppliers well is a priority. We\u2019ve worked with most of these companies for many years, and we\u2019ll be doing business together for many years to come, so we\u2019ll have that longer term mindset as we work together through this year. It\u2019s helpful that more than two-thirds of what we sell in the U.S. is made, assembled or grown here. In recent years, our U.S. percentage has grown. Last year, we purchased $296 billion in the United States and we made a commitment back in 2021 to add another $350 billion in incremental U.S. volume over the following 10 years. We recently announced additional support for U.S. businesses in the form of Grow With Us, which will provide small businesses in the U.S. with the education, training and resources they need to help them get started with us.\nYou might be surprised to know that nearly 60% of our suppliers in the U.S. are small businesses. We\u2019ll also continue to hold our Open Call event in October, where we invite U.S. companies that aren\u2019t doing business with us to introduce their company and their products. That is one of the most fun days of the year for us as merchants. The merchandise that we import comes from all over the world from dozens of countries. Other than the U.S., the other large markets are China, Mexico, Vietnam, India and Canada. China in particular represents a lot of volume in certain categories like electronics and toys. All of the tariffs create cost pressure for us, but the larger tariffs on China have the biggest impact. The cost pressure from all the tariff impacted markets started in late April and it accelerated in May.\nLet me describe how we think about that and what we\u2019re doing about it. First, we want to keep our food and consumables\u2019 prices as low as we can. Food prices in the U.S. have gone up in recent years and our customers have been feeling that all along. We won\u2019t let tariff related cost pressure on some general merchandise items put pressure on food prices. But as it relates to food tariffs on countries like Costa Rica, Peru and Colombia are pressuring imported items like bananas, avocados, coffee and roses. We\u2019ll do our best to control what we can control in order to keep food prices as low as possible. An example would be controlling the amount of fresh food waste. In some cases, we\u2019re holding our retails where they are despite the tariff cost pressure.\nFlowers for Mother\u2019s Day at Sam\u2019s Club U.S. is a good example. When it comes to the general merchandise categories that are impacted, we\u2019ll move production where that\u2019s possible. That isn\u2019t easy or fast, but we\u2019ve been working on that for years, so it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve just started to make adjustments. In some cases, we\u2019ll absorb costs within a category or department and not simply pass on a tariff cost attributable to each item individually. We\u2019ll be managing mix across items, categories and businesses. We also have suppliers shifting materials from tariff impacted components like aluminum to fiberglass, where there is no tariff. Our merchants, sourcing team and suppliers are being creative. It\u2019s been impressive to watch our team identify opportunities and adjust.\nAs we continue to diversify our profit streams through our eCommerce offering, our marketplace and membership and advertising, we have some room to absorb costs. We\u2019re committed to growing profit faster than sales. There isn\u2019t anything about this quarter or anything about this coming year that shakes our confidence about growing profit faster than sales over the term of our long range plan. The strategy and business model are set up to do that. In summary, the takeaways from my remarks today are, one, we delivered a good first quarter. Two, our strategy and omnichannel capabilities are strong. We\u2019ll keep getting better in terms of assortment, delivery speed and we\u2019ll keep scaling our newer businesses. We\u2019ll keep driving growth and we\u2019ll control what we can control.\nWe continue to be confident in our ability to strengthen this business even as we navigate cost of goods changes. Our short and longer term opportunities are clear. And three, we\u2019re positioned to manage the cost pressure from tariffs as well or better than anyone. But even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices. The timing of the tariffs and our inventory receipts matters as you interpret our results by quarter. John David will say more about how retail accounting and timing will play out through the year. I\u2019ll wrap up my remarks today the same way I opened, by thanking our associates. Our store club and supply chain associates are working hard and learning new capabilities. Our home office and tech associates are partnering to manage the short term, while building for the long term.\nWe\u2019ve been operating in challenging environments for years now, and we\u2019ll come through this one stronger than ever just as we have before. We have Associates and Shareholders Week coming up. It\u2019s my favorite week of the year. I look forward to seeing so many of our associates and many of you here in Northwest Arkansas. John David, I\u2019ll turn it over to you.\nJohn David Rainey: Thanks, Doug. Our first quarter performance demonstrates the strength of our business and the relevance of our omni strategy in the context of a highly dynamic backdrop. I\u2019m pleased with the continued sales momentum across the company and it speaks to the competitive advantages that set us apart in the retail marketplace. Our commitment to delivering value and convenience to our customers is resonating more than ever. At the same time, we\u2019re driving progress in high growth areas like advertising, membership and marketplace services. Our April results were better than we had expected, particularly in Walmart U.S. Sales across segments improved as the quarter progressed, including strong Easter seasonal events.\nAnd our teams did a nice job managing inventory and controllable expenses, leading to a stronger than forecasted performance in both gross profit and SG&A. Consolidated revenue increased 4% in constant currency, despite lapping last year\u2019s leap day, driven by strong growth in eCommerce of 22%. Currency headwinds reduced reported sales results by $2.4 billion or 150 basis points of growth. Walmart U.S. comp sales grew 4.5%, aided by strong eCommerce sales growth of 21%. Momentum in grocery sales continued with a mid-single digit comp and ongoing share gains. Health and wellness sales increased high-teens, reflecting higher prescription volumes and over the counter sales, while general merchandise sales declined slightly with softness in electronics, home products and sporting goods.\nWe\u2019re focused on value and managing our relative price position, while also saving customers\u2019 time with our eCommerce options. In Walmart U.S., we have more than 5,000 price rollbacks across our assortment and we\u2019ve seen private brand sales outperform with grocery private brand penetration, up 60 basis points versus last year. Our international business grew sales 7.8% in constant currency, reflecting strength in China and Flipkart. eCommerce was strong with double-digit growth across markets led by pickup and delivery in marketplace. We\u2019re increasing speed of delivery for customers. In international, items delivered same or next day increased by 35% with about 45% of those items delivered in under three hours. At Walmex, lapping last year\u2019s government stimulus payments, the Easter shift and some early quarter softness tied to a weaker and uncertain macro environment, led to slightly softer sales than anticipated.\nWe\u2019re encouraged by the pickup in business more recently with sales back in line with our expectations. Sam\u2019s Club U.S. comp sales ex-fuel increased nearly 7% with strong growth in transactions, including strength in Member\u2019s Mark. eCommerce grew 27% led by triple-digit growth in Club fulfilled delivery and double-digit growth in pickup. Members value the convenience of Scan & Go, and their usage of this tool continues to grow with penetration increasing 600 basis points versus last year. Over 50% of our members now transact digitally in some form with Sam\u2019s, online or using digital solutions in Club. From a margin standpoint, consolidated gross margin increased 12 basis points due to better than expected results at Walmart U.S., partially offset by lower than expected results in international, which saw increased pressure from channel and format mix changes.\nGross margins in Walmart U.S. increased 25 basis points, reflecting continued disciplined inventory management, including a lower level of markdowns and improvements in business mix that have offset increased pressure from merchandise category mix. As our business model evolves, contributions to profitability are increasingly influenced by a diverse set of drivers, including improved eCommerce economics and business mix. We achieved eCommerce profitability, both in the U.S. as well as for the global enterprise in Q1 for the first time, an important milestone for our company. In the U.S., eCommerce net delivery costs have declined as we\u2019ve continued to densify our last-mile deliveries and as customers pay fees for faster delivery. Business mix, most notably from higher-margin areas like advertising and membership fees also contributed to the improvement in Q1 profitability.\nOur advertising business across markets increased 50%, including VIZIO. Walmart Connect in the U.S., which doesn\u2019t include VIZIO, grew 31%. Sam\u2019s Club U.S. ad business was up 21%, and we saw 20% growth in our international markets led by Flipkart. Membership fee income was up nearly 15% across the enterprise. In the U.S., Sam\u2019s Club continued to see steady growth in member counts, renewal rates, and increased penetration of plus members, resulting in membership income growth of 9.6%, while Walmart+ membership income grew double-digits. Within International, membership income from Sam\u2019s Club China grew more than 40% as member counts continue to increase. SG&A expenses deleveraged 6 basis points, including the benefit from lapping last year\u2019s business reorganization cost.\nAs expected, International and Sam\u2019s Club U.S. expense deleverage reflects planned investments in associate wages. Walmart U.S. deleverage reflected increased depreciation expense as well as VIZIO operating cost post-acquisition. As we previewed at our Investor Day, we experienced higher-than-expected casualty claims expense. We\u2019re accruing a higher rate for claims cost based on the industry trends that point to higher risk adjustment factors. We expect this trend to persist for at least a few quarters. Adjusted operating income was better than expected with growth of 3% in constant currency and adjusted EPS of $0.61 was higher than our guided range. Importantly, our inventory is at a healthy level, up 3.8%. That\u2019s obviously as important as ever as we head into a tariff-impacted period where cost pressures will impact item pricing and make it more challenging to anticipate demand by item.\nThis is a highly fluid situation and we\u2019ll need to manage quantity decisions as we measure the price elasticity of impacted items. I\u2019m grateful that we have a team of experienced merchants, various levers we can pull, and the tools available to manage this in a thoughtful and proactive way. Our cash position provides the flexibility we need to lean into opportunities to grow share, while also continuing to invest in areas with long-term strategic value, such as supply chain automation, store growth, remodels, and tech. In April, we completed an approximately $4 billion debt issuance at attractive terms. We continue to expect FY \u201926 CapEx to be in the range of 3% to 3.5% of sales. During Q1, we repurchased $4.6 billion in stock, an amount equivalent to our share repurchases for the entire year last year.\nWe have a lot of confidence in our business, and we\u2019ll continue to be opportunistic with buybacks if share price dislocations occur. Now, turning to guidance. As a matter of practice, we provide an update on our full-year outlook at the end of the second quarter, if appropriate. But I\u2019d like to give some color on how we\u2019re thinking about the impact from tariffs. I want to start with reiterating our message from our Investor Day in early April. We have a lot of confidence in our strategy, and there is nothing about this current period that makes us feel differently about anything we\u2019ve previously said about our long-term financial framework to grow annual sales about 4% and operating income faster than sales. We\u2019ve seen during periods of economic uncertainty in the past, we tend to gain share and come out of the other side in an even stronger position.\nWe expect this period to be no different. We\u2019ll play offense and may opportunistically invest in areas to improve our value proposition. But we\u2019re not fully immune from the financial impacts in the short term. We\u2019ve done work internally to model various scenarios related to the ongoing trade policy discussions. These scenarios involve making assumptions about how long tariffs persist at certain levels versus coming down to some lower level once bilateral trade deals are completed. We also must make assumptions about the elasticity of demand as well as the overall macro backdrop in this environment. Perhaps it\u2019s obvious, but worth stating. The range of possible outcomes is much greater than when we originally provided our annual guidance. That said, in what we believe are the most likely scenarios that we\u2019ve modeled, we still have the ability to achieve our full-year guidance for both sales and operating income.\nThese scenarios involve the belief that trade policy discussions will result in bilateral agreements, agreements in principle for the existence of good faith discussions moving toward agreements that could result in tariff levels lower than those initially proposed in early April. However, if we see a restoration of dramatically higher tariff levels, the impact on our financials could be significant and even jeopardize our ability to grow earnings year-over-year. In any case, we\u2019re comfortable with our ability to grow sales in the range we\u2019ve guided for the year, though the mix of AUR versus units may be much different in these scenarios. While the swings from quarter-to-quarter could be large, we still think we can achieve our operating income guidance for the year, given what we know and our assumptions that I referenced.\nShould more progress on-trade in the next several weeks be favorable, there could be upside. If elevated tariffs remain in place for an elongated period, there would be downside risk. We will know a lot more in a couple of months, but we are equipped to manage this as well or better than other retailers. Turning to the second quarter. The operating environment is highly fluid and it makes the very near-term exceedingly difficult to forecast. The level and speed at which tariff impacted prices could go up is more extreme than in normal periods. The U.S. is by far our number one market for sourcing. For the less than a third of what we sell in the U.S. that\u2019s imported, China, Mexico, Canada, Vietnam, and India are our largest markets. As Doug noted, we\u2019re encouraged by the recent trade negotiations, especially concerning China.\nThe level of tariffs that result from those discussions and the timing of when they ultimately become final may cause larger swings in our financial performance from one quarter to the next. Moreover, there are two specific accounting methods that make these swings more difficult to forecast. I want to take the time to explain these because they may impact the second and future quarters, given cost pressures caused by tariffs. The first relates to our method of accounting for the cost of inventory for the majority of our U.S. business, the Retail Inventory Method or RIM for short. We\u2019ve always used RIM in Walmart U.S. It\u2019s not new for us, and it\u2019s a common method of accounting in the retail industry. RIM accounting implies a ratio of the actual cost of the inventory to its retail price to calculate ending inventory and therefore, derive cost of goods sold.\nAs prices go up, this can result in the potential for markups on our inventory and increased merchandise margin gains relative to periods of more constant price levels. To the extent that later markdowns need to be recorded, it can have an offsetting effect. The magnitude of these swings, both positive and negative, given the level of additional costs that could be applied to the inventory that we\u2019re purchasing right now are unprecedented in our business and could result in swings in margin and earnings by quarter. The second is the possibility of LIFO-related charges as prices go up, which we experienced in Sam\u2019s Club U.S. during a sustained inflationary period in FY \u201924. We currently expect that sales growth on a constant currency basis will be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5% for the second quarter, though the composition of sales through AUR versus units may be different than what we expect today.\nNotably, if current exchange rates were to stay where they are right now for the entire second quarter, we would expect a headwind of approximately 120 basis points to reported sales growth. For operating income, the range of outcomes for the quarter is much wider. The information related to the trade discussions taking place is changing by the week and in some cases by the day. Importantly, we also want to provide flexibility for us to play offense in this environment. And lastly, our method of accounting for inventory could have a larger impact on our earnings than in normal quarters. For these reasons, the range of outcomes for the quarter is so wide that it would be impractical to provide a range of operating income guidance that investors could credibly rely upon.\nI want to encourage you to think about the next couple of quarters in the aggregate. We may experience larger gains related to markups in the second quarter, and some of those may be offset by markdowns in the third and fourth quarters. This is why we\u2019ve underscored the importance of managing inventory well in this environment. In total, though, we believe that we can still achieve our operating income guidance for the year. In closing, as we look ahead, while operating conditions are expected to remain dynamic, our strategy is clear. Our top line momentum is strong, and we\u2019re flexing into our advantages to protect margins as we grow. History tells us that when we lean into these times of economic uncertainty, we emerge on the other side as a stronger company.\nWe expect this time to be no different. We appreciate your interest in our company, and are now ready to take your questions.\nQ&A Session\nFollow Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)\nFollow Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question today is from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nPaul Lejuez: Hi, thank you, guys. Thanks for all the details on your pricing philosophy tied to tariffs, very helpful. My question is on eComm, big milestone for the company, achieving profitability in the eComm business. Just curious what finally got you over the hump? And whereto from here in terms of where margins in that business can go relative to the rest of the business? And what do you see as the key drivers of further improvement to eComm profitability from here? Thanks.\nJohn David Rainey: Paul, thank you for your question. This is John David. Let me start with just giving a little bit more detail on the global eComm profitability. We noted that we achieved it on an enterprise basis globally as well as for the U.S. segment. And so if you to break that down by segment, the U.S. was profitable, Sam\u2019s was profitable, and the international was slightly unprofitable. But if you take all of those together, we had a profit for the quarter. So we\u2019re really pleased with that. There are a few things that have driven the performance, notably in the U.S. And John will talk more about this, but one is the densification of our network. And what I mean by that, as we have more customers that are coming to Walmart now and taking advantage of our eCommerce offerings, we\u2019re able to spread those deliveries over multiple households.\nSo think about the opportunity to deliver a package to five houses on a street versus one house on a street. And so as we grow, we continue to spread those costs over more volume. The second is delivery cost, and this is where John and his team have made a tremendous amount of progress in reducing the unit cost. And this is a lot of the supply chain infrastructure that we\u2019ve implemented. But part of that too is the willingness that customers have shown to be able to pay for expedited delivery. And what I mean by that is delivery within one hour or within three hours. We noted in the last quarter that fully a-third of our customers are taking advantage of that option. And it shows the relevance of convenience. We\u2019ve seen an uptick in that even in the most recent period.\nAnd so John, maybe you want to add a little bit more, but to me those are a couple things that stand out to help improve the profitability.\nJohn Furner: Yes. Thanks, John David. Paul, a few things, if you look back over the last few years, I think it\u2019s a combination of investments we made for about the last decade. And those investments would include getting our applications to a single app, building new fulfillment centers, enabling stores to be part of the omni solution. The speed of delivery has been encouraging the last year. Our sub three-hour deliveries are up about 91% year-on-year. John David mentioned also the scale of the operation. It has taken a number of years, but we\u2019re pleased with the progress and the growth. We\u2019ve been running 21% growth for multiple quarters in a row. For customers in particular, what the team has done that I\u2019ve been really impressed with is providing customers flexibility to serve customers when they want to be served the way they want to be served.\nSo a Walmart customer can shop at the counter, they can shop with curbside pickup. We have in-home delivery, our first and third party delivery options including fulfillment services for our sellers has been on a strong growth rate for the last few years and that has resulted, as John David said, lower delivery costs due to density and frequency. All of that put together has enabled us to \u2014 has helped us enable business mix with advertising, our data businesses and when you put it all together, just really proud of the team to be able to sit here today and announce a quarter of profitability for the first time as we told you just a month ago when we were together in Dallas and importantly the team has exited the quarter with momentum. There was a strong April, we had a strong Easter.\nOur omni capabilities enabled us to deliver floral and other things that people need last minute for the Easter holiday and Mother\u2019s Day. So we\u2019ll keep working on better ways to serve customers, improving the speed, improving density and working efficiently across all the channels.\nPaul Lejuez: Thank you, guys. Good luck.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Gutman: Hi, good morning, everyone, and good quarter. So Doug and John David, you both touched on this. You built this business and financial model now that your margins could go up and invest faster for growth at the same time. I\u2019ve asked you in the past about, like, the toggling that balance and I kind of heard some of the prepared remarks on this. I\u2019ll push back and say why not toggle it in favor of investments even more in this environment. We know how much or how important it is getting more gross profit dollars, especially in Jan-March. Why not lean into there? And you said it yourselves, Walmart should be better positioned than most to navigate this environment. Thanks.\nDoug McMillon: Yes. Thanks, Simeon. This is Doug. I\u2019ll go first, and then John David can comment. I think with our guidance where it is for the year, we positioned ourselves to be appropriately aggressive. I think as the quarters play out, we may make different choices depending on what\u2019s happening with pricing. It is fluid. We\u2019re watching what\u2019s happening with cost of goods. There are a lot of moving parts as it relates to merchandising these days. And as it relates to the retail prices, we\u2019ll watch where our price gaps are, but we\u2019ll also watch what customers are telling us and the response that we get from them and the pressure that they\u2019re feeling. So the bottom line is, if we need to invest more, we can. Having said that, I really want to grow profit faster than sales.\nLike, we\u2019ve been working on this for a long time. I think we deserve that. You guys deserve that. And if we can navigate this in a way as we balance all the interests between customers, shareholders and everyone else, such that we can keep prices low enough to help people and grow profit faster than sales. That\u2019s what winning looks like to me.\nJohn David Rainey: I would underscore the points that Doug made. I feel, Simeon, that we are striking the right balance between investment and growing profits. If you look over the last two years, we grew operating income about 10% on average. Our guidance is, let\u2019s call it, roughly half of that this year. And so this is a year of investment. But even while doing that, we are hopeful to be able to grow profits faster themselves. If there\u2019s, to me, a story about the quarter from a financial perspective, it\u2019s really one of the diversification of our income streams. And so you\u2019re seeing all these things play out. If you were to just take advertising and membership as an example, that\u2019s a quarter of our profits. Membership was really strong in the quarter.\nWe grew each segment membership double digits. International was north of 20%. So you\u2019re seeing this diversification of our income streams that allows us to continue to take a very long term perspective and invest in this business. So these are always a little tricky in terms of what striking that right balance, but we feel like the plan that we have right now is the right one for us.\nSimeon Gutman: Thanks. Good luck.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Horvers: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So I wanted to ask a question about the consumer and the upper and lower end. You called out strong gains with upper income households. Is that coming through on the eCommerce side mainly in addition to what\u2019s going on in the store? And then on the other side, there\u2019s been a dialogue in the market that maybe the lower end consumer is getting weaker and seeing some incremental pressure and perhaps leading to some bottom of funnel loss where they\u2019re trading out of Walmart to lower sort of unit, lower average cost locations, and doing smaller shops. So can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing on the both sides in terms of the health as well as the share performance? Thank you.\nJohn Furner: Christopher, it\u2019s John. I\u2019ll first anchor on comments that John David made earlier this morning, which are that customers, in some cases, we\u2019ve heard of some concern, they remain choiceful and consistent and we continue to see customers prioritizing value and speed of delivery. We have seen growth across all income cohorts in the quarter, fortunately, and I\u2019m proud of the fact that in April we saw a number of new customers and probably \u2014 it\u2019s probably a good time to remind you just the shape of the quarter in terms of the calendar. This is a calendar where we had leap year last year and then we had a very late Easter. So February was softer than we expected. March was back to normal and we exited the quarter with a very strong April, including a strong Easter holiday, which is a reminder that customers are prioritizing seasonal events, getting together, having meals at home.\nAnd importantly, we want to be very flexible for our customers. If customers choose to shop in store, we want to have a great store experience. We\u2019re very pleased with our remodel program. We continue to see accelerated results and high NPS scores after remodel. Our fast delivery scores are some of the highest scores that we have in the company. And over the course of the rest of the year, you will continue to see us expand our capacity and capability to deliver from FCs quickly, including same day, next day and two days. And we are growing our fast delivery options almost 100% year-on-year. You heard that this morning growing 91%. So we\u2019ll continue to focus on value with great products in meat produce, our better goods line, really proud of the progress in apparel.\nToys has had a strong quarter, particularly the holiday and then we\u2019ll remain very, very flexible for our customers as we move throughout the year.\nChristopher Horvers: I think from a Sam\u2019s Club point of view, I underline everything that John just said. I think that right now, I think we\u2019re leaning into the power of the model of the membership warehouse retail model. We have incredible prices because we\u2019ve curated items for members. And what we find is that this resonates whether you\u2019re earning a lot of money or whether you\u2019re working through how you spend your money each toward the end of your pay packet. We\u2019re seeing growth in convenience. We really see that convenience is something that resonates for everybody. And in fact, what we give them back is the power of time. So if we make things easier for people, they have more time and that\u2019s incredibly valuable to people.\nSo I would just close by saying that the growth in our membership, the 5% \u2014 10% growth in our membership income is driven by more people renewing more new members and a higher mix of plus participation. And we\u2019re seeing that across all of our income cohorts.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Peter Benedict with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Benedict: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So mine is kind of on capital allocation. You talked about CapEx 3% to 3.5% of sales. It sounds like that probably trends toward the upper end of that range this year. I\u2019m wondering if you could frame where we stand with the automation investment and the spend on that front. Should we be thinking CapEx in dollars as kind of at a peakish level here at least for the intermediate term? And then on the buyback, great to see in the first quarter, it looks like you spent, as you said, more than last year, but also more than two years ago. Any way we should be thinking about that going forward and your willingness to commit more to buyback? Thanks so much.\nJohn David Rainey: Sure, Peter. Thank you for the question. On capital allocation, I\u2019ll start with CapEx. The right way to think about that level for our business is in the 3% to 3.5% of sales. So that should grow with revenue as we go forward. It may vacillate a little bit between the top-end and the bottom-end of that. But given what we know and the opportunities that we have to drive improved returns through some of this investment, we\u2019re not shying away from this. And we\u2019re taking a very long-term perspective even in this current operating environment where we see some of those costs are coming in higher. We look at capital allocation as every dollar has to fight for its highest return. And this is one of the best ways that we can spend a dollar.\nThat said, we saw significant price dislocation in the quarter as some of the uncertainties filtered through the market. And we are very aggressive in our share buyback, as I noted, buying back more than we did in the entirety of last year. And we\u2019ll continue to do that as we see price dislocation because we have a lot of conviction in our strategy. We have a lot of confidence in the plan that we have, and we believe there\u2019s a lot of shareholder value to be created here. And so as we see these types of dislocations, you\u2019re going to see us be more aggressive. I think it\u2019s fair to say, obviously, we\u2019re going to use \u2014 we\u2019re going to spend more in share buyback this year than we did last year, given that we\u2019ve already done that one quarter into the year.\nThe total amount of that is to be determined. We\u2019ll see where prices are. We need to balance this with both increasing our dividend as well as investing in ourselves through CapEx.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brad Thomas, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Thomas: Thanks. Good morning. The Walmart Connect growth was particularly impressive this quarter and showed some acceleration for you. I was wondering if you could comment a bit more on the strength in advertising and any incremental learnings you\u2019ve had so far as you continue to integrate VIZIO? Thanks.\nJohn Furner: Hi, Brad, it\u2019s John. We had a good quarter with Walmart Connect, as you mentioned, up 31% year-on-year, and also a strong quarter around the world and the other advertising businesses that we operate. We\u2019re in the initial stages of integrating VIZIO. I\u2019m excited about the plans we have for VIZIO the rest of the year. It\u2019s a great operating system, very frictionless, easy to sign up and we\u2019re looking forward to the contributions of the VIZIO team going forward. In terms of the core advertising business, we\u2019ve had strength with the growth of advertising with our marketplace sellers. Our GMV and marketplace has been very consistent in the mid to high 20s. Last quarter was in the mid-20s as well. We also have had continued strength with first-party and third-party suppliers.\nSo it\u2019s a broad mix of capabilities. Additionally, this quarter, we launched pharmacy delivery, and that\u2019s another opportunity for our customers to enjoy the flexibility that we offer. And so there will be new opportunities, I think, as we go forward and look ahead. But in general, we\u2019re really pleased with the progress, the momentum, and the team that we\u2019ve established at Walmart Connect.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lasser: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. John David, in your remarks, you said if elevated tariffs remain in place for an elongated period, there would be downside risks. Now you guys are astute poker players and probably will not articulate \u2014 clearly define what elevated tariff rates are, but would you consider the current level of tariffs to be elevated, meaning that there could be downside risk if they don\u2019t come down? And more importantly, over the long-term, is there anything about this tariff situation that would existentially impact Walmart\u2019s margins, meaning that given the opportunity of time and flexibility, you would be able to fully mitigate all that you see in front of you and/or such that you would be able to have margin rates that are consistent with what you had expected over the longer-term? Thank you very much.\nJohn David Rainey: Thanks for the question, Michael. Let me start with the second part of your question first. We don\u2019t see anything, and this is \u2014 we indicated this in our prepared remarks. We don\u2019t see anything that changes the way that we think about our business long-term related to the current environment that we\u2019re in. And so we think that we can navigate this. I think that the thing that everyone is focused on, certainly in the Fed is to make sure that these are one-time price increase and not something that persists and bleeds into wage growth and other things that have a more longer-term effect. In terms of the first part of your question, what I was referring to is where the level of tariffs that were announced at the beginning of April.\nKeep in mind, a week ago, we were at 145% tariffs in China. And certainly, you know as well as anyone, the preparation that goes into this day for us and so when we started the preparation around earnings, that\u2019s the construct that we were working under. And in 145% tariff environment and tariffs at a level that are approaching 50% for other countries is not a good outcome for retailers, not a good outcome for the economy. We\u2019re very pleased and appreciative of the progress that\u2019s been made by the administration to bring tariffs down to this level. And the guidance that we gave today of the affirmation of our full-year guidance is with tariffs at this level. But let me emphasize, we still think that\u2019s too high. There are certain items, certain categories of merchandise that we\u2019re dependent upon to import from other countries and prices of those things are likely going to go up, and that\u2019s not good for consumers.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nEdward Kelly: Hi, good morning, everyone. I wanted to follow up on another tariff question and inventory planning. And as you stated, it\u2019s a difficult backdrop for planning inventory. Tariffs, obviously, a moving target, I think uncertainty around elasticities. So against that backdrop, how are you thinking about the planning of the inventory? Do you stay lean hoping that tariffs come down? Do you get aggressive because we\u2019re on a 90-day pause? And bigger picture question that I have related to this is, can you avoid the risk of another \u201922 scenario given the dynamic backdrop? Do you think that\u2019s a risk for retail? Thank you.\nDoug McMillon: Yes. Thanks for the question, Edward. This is Doug, and you guys can chime in if you want to. I think the way to start is to remind you, as I said in my prepared remarks, that we have a lot of replenishable items at Walmart. It\u2019s such a strength to be operating off the side counters rather than some sort of high-low marketing driven model where we\u2019re focused on features in the actionality and end caps, for example. So on replenishable goods, we have the opportunity to partner with our suppliers to see what happens with sales as costs and then eventually retails adjust and then manage that through the weeks and months ahead. So that\u2019s a great position to be in, and our merchants and our replenishment team are really good at that, and they\u2019re managing that on a daily basis.\nAs tariff numbers have changed, they\u2019ve done a great job of pivoting, recalculating quantities and thinking through it again. Where it can get more challenging is, we make decisions related to things like Halloween and Christmas farther out. And how do you make a quantity call? And what tariff number do you use? And the best answer we can give you is, we\u2019ve got a sales plan, we\u2019re operating against that sales plan. Some of the quantities will be adjusted based on what we think the tariffs are going to be. We\u2019ve made some tariff assumptions and then we\u2019ll partner with our suppliers to flow that. And if we need to chase goods, chase some goods. And the bottom line is, yes, we want to avoid what happened back in 2022 and by paying close attention to our unit decisions, that\u2019s how we\u2019ll do it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kate McShane with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nKate McShane: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. We wondered if you could talk about how the tariff situation is impacting your sellers on marketplace, both from an inventory standpoint and how you think about the contribution to advertising as a result of this more difficult environment?\nJohn Furner: Hi, Kate. It\u2019s John. In terms of overall inventory management, Walmart, along with our capability to serve sellers, we\u2019ve built a number of tools in the last three years that are particularly helpful. And for sellers in particular, having services like Walmart Fulfillment Service with heightened visibility of their inventory where it is, our ability to move around the country is particularly helpful. As we sit here today, the ports are flowing, inventory is moving, so we don\u2019t have any concerns at this point about port backups in the United States. So our inventory is flowing through. I did mention earlier that our GMV growth rates in marketplace in particular have been consistent over the last few quarters. You saw that in the release.\nWe\u2019re also seeing that again as you exit the quarter. So we had a strong April in eCommerce and this is a big contributor to the overall health of the eCommerce business with the 21% growth rate that has been in place for some time, which is we are pleased to see. And then finally adding together our stores, our first party eCommerce business, our new automated fulfillment centers, distribution capabilities, our third party business and fulfillment services that has enabled us to have this ad business and data business, which has helped us mix out to achieve our first quarter of profitability in the United States.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nScot Ciccarelli: Good morning, everyone. I know you talked about 50% growth in advertising and 15% in membership. So can you help reconcile those figures against what looks like just under 4% growth in the membership and other line in the P&L, just so we can better understand the components there? And then secondly, now that eComm has turned positive, can you provide any color on the magnitude of losses you had incurred over the last, call it, year or two, just so we can better understand the size of the profit improvement? Thanks.\nJohn David Rainey: Sure. I\u2019ll take the question. First on advertising, really pleased with the growth that we\u2019ve seen there. It was inflated this period, because we\u2019ve got compare \u2014 we\u2019ve got VIZIO in there versus comparing against a period that we don\u2019t. But our overall advertising on an apples to apples basis was 27%. So we feel really good about that. On membership, we felt really good about the progress there. As I noted, we had international that grew north of 20%. Both Sam\u2019s and U.S. grew double digits. The line that we have in our P&L includes other, it says membership and other, and that includes things like sustainability income. So think about recycling revenue, things like that. And that\u2019s probably a larger figure than what some people expect.\nAnd so that\u2019s what\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the reconciliation to, I think, the 4% number that you quoted there. But overall membership is \u2014 actually it\u2019s really one of the shining points of the quarter. We\u2019re doing really well there. On eComm losses, I don\u2019t think I want to get into the magnitude of some of the losses that we\u2019ve had historically. We\u2019ve consistently, though, for years, seen improvements there. If you have to go back several years to see the depth of, sort of, where losses topped out, but John and his team and it\u2019s really all segments. So if you look at what Flipkart is doing in India, look at what Sam\u2019s has been doing, we\u2019ve continued to see contribution profit be positive. And with a digital platform, as you grow that at a positive contribution profit, you ultimately get to overall profitability, which is where we are today.\nSo this is kind of a milestone moment for us as a company. Hopefully, we don\u2019t talk about it every single quarter, but I think it\u2019s notable this quarter that we\u2019ve reached this milestone and we\u2019ve achieved this level of profit, and we\u2019re looking forward to continuing to have that grow into the future.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nRobby Ohmes: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you guys could talk \u2014 could give a little more detail on general merchandise. You guys had deflation in general merchandise in the first quarter. Can you help us think about deflation versus inflation and tariffs for the outlook here for the next three quarters? And also, is there any \u2014 are there pretty significant differences between mix of general merchandise or changing in mix of general merchandise for in-store versus what you guys are doing in eCommerce?\nJohn David Rainey: Robby, thanks for the question. I\u2019ll start, and some of the others may want to jump in. General merchandise has been deflationary for over a year right now, and we\u2019ve seen the impact of that and think of it as deflationary and low single digits in the quarter. Importantly, though, we grew units in the quarter, so we continue to see progress there. But the consumer is pressured. We\u2019ve seen for a couple of years now a shift in the baskets away from general merchandise to those items that are more necessities versus discretionary. So people are spending more on food. So we\u2019ll continue to monitor that going forward. But the team in particular has made really good progress on the assortment that we have and really advancing general merchandise there. John, you want to?\nJohn Furner: Sure. Robby, good morning. We did see strong growth in categories like toys, kids apparel, and our baby categories and others across the business. We do have stronger growth rates in eCommerce in the total. You can see that as well with 21% growth rates, which would reflect really a strong mix across categories. And as we look at where we ended the quarter, we were softer in February. Just a reminder, we had really tough weather. It was lapping leap year. We had snow across the country, including the Southeast and on beaches across the Southeast. So we had unusual weather in February. Mentioned this earlier. March was felt like more of a normalized month closer to what we expected given the flip in leap year and a much later Easter.\nAnd then as we got to Easter holiday, the units strengthened pretty significantly and we reported this morning that we were slightly negative in general merchandise with deflation, but was really encouraged by the results that we had from the Easter holiday until the end of the quarter.\nChris Nicholas: Yes. And in Sam\u2019s Club, we hit almost positive quarter of GM sales back to back in a deflated environment. So units are the driver of that performance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nRupesh Parikh: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. So I just want to go back to a strong momentum in the health and wellness category. Just want to get a sense of how you guys feel about the sustainability of the momentum? And then as you look at the pharmacy rollout, how is that trending versus expectation? And any sense as whether it\u2019s driving new customer acquisition at this point?\nJohn Furner: Hi, Rupesh, thanks for the question. When we look at the pharmacy business and you saw in the reported results this morning, growth in the mid-20s, when you strip out the impact of GLP-1s, we saw prescription growth, over 10% growth in the quarter, which is very encouraging. That result is inclusive of market share gains and it\u2019s driven by a few things. First, I would just like to compliment our pharmacists, our pharmacy techs, the team in the field, who do such a great job helping customers and patients with whatever they need help with. And then the second was the initiative of pharmacy delivery, which we launched in the first quarter, which has been helpful not only for customers to receive their prescriptions the way they want to receive them, but it has resulted in growth of new digital users in our eCommerce business.\nSo we\u2019ve had a digital business with text message for some time, where you could renew. Now that you can deliver, we see people signing up for an account on walmart.com, in our app, and we\u2019re looking forward to being able to serve them in more ways across categories.\nChris Nicholas: I think it\u2019s worth mentioning that Sam\u2019s once again for the ninth year in a row when the J.D. Power Pharmacy Company of the Year and the ex-GLP growth is still double digits, so it\u2019s over 10%. So we\u2019re feeling really good about that business.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of David Bellinger with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Bellinger: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. First one, just on understanding outcomes for Q2 are so wide on the guidance right now, and you can\u2019t give us a definitive range there on profitability. Can you just walk us through your positioning on the full year guide? Why are you still confident to keep that range? Do you expect these wide swings you talked about on margins and operating income, could those be contained within the combined Q2 and Q3 timeframe? And just secondly, anything on the international and the momentum you\u2019re seeing there, especially on the operating income side? Thank you.\nJohn David Rainey: I\u2019ll start with the first part of your answer and then kick it over to Kath to talk about International. It\u2019s hard to predict. We don\u2019t know the level of tariffs of where the bilateral agreements are going to finalize that. We do know that we\u2019re probably going to be in a period in the second quarter, we\u2019re going to see more markups than normal. If we \u2014 that\u2019s why Doug and others have mentioned that it\u2019s so important to get inventory right in this environment because that reduces the likelihood of taking markdowns in the third quarter and potentially even into the fourth. And so it remains to be seen what the elasticity of demand is, it\u2019s something that\u2019s 30% higher or in other cases 10% higher in certain items.\nSo we\u2019ll have to see that. We\u2019ve got a really, really good team of merchants and we have a lot of confidence in their ability to navigate this environment. Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it, we\u2019ve got some experience here from a couple of years ago. And so we\u2019ll try to navigate this. And as Doug said, I like our hand here. I think we can navigate this as well or better than anyone. But there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty, a lot of volatility. It\u2019s a dynamic and fluid environment and we feel confident that we can land the year in the range that we\u2019ve talked about, but the swings from quarter-to-quarter are a little harder to predict and we\u2019ll have to see how that comes.\nKath McLay: Yes, if I pick it up from there because definitely foreshadow that we have swings by quarter in International when we\u2019re together in Dallas. And if I was to characterize the quarter, I would say, it was a good result, but I think we can still do better. I don\u2019t think my team would be surprised to hear me say that because I think that\u2019s the constant posture we typically have. When I look across the composition of the markets, we had a couple that had a weaker backdrop, which would be more Mexico and Canada. I think we made strategic investments in high-growth markets like India. You heard Kalyan, our CEO of Flipkart talk about that when we were together at ICM. But if I \u2014 and then I think we also had some choppy calendar results, Leap year, Easter, et cetera.\nSo when I step-back and kind of look at the overall result, I think we\u2019re in high-growth markets. We\u2019ve got really strong businesses and we\u2019re in a leading omnichannel position in those markets. And so I think holistically, still feel really good about leading the enterprise from a growth perspective and growing profit faster than sales across the full year.\nDoug McMillon: This is Doug. It\u2019s probably worth just repeating one more time the point about retail accounting as it relates to the timing between Q2, Q3, Q4. In Q2, if we have a markup, we take it on all the inventory we have on-hand, even if we don\u2019t sell it in that quarter and even if we don\u2019t ultimately sell it at that price. So you could get a situation where Q2 earnings look unusually high and the range of outcomes is wider, which is why we\u2019re not providing guidance for the quarter. Then think about Q3 and Q4. Can you sell it at the price that you marked it up to? Yes or no, what do the resulting margins look like? How do you manage markdowns, how do you manage inventory effectively through the Q3 and Q4 period? And there may be more markups in Q3 and Q4.\nWe don\u2019t know right now because this environment is so fluid. I hope that helps everybody. Just I want to make sure that you all understand this is an accounting issue, a timing issue, but it ultimately boils down to how well do we forecast sales, manage inventory, and make quantity decisions.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg Melich: Hi, thanks for all the detail on the tariffs. And I guess, Doug, I just want to follow up on that last point. Given where we are today with the tariff rates, the 30% incremental China and then the 10% seems to be the baseline, what\u2019s the time lag that you would expect to see that show up on the shelf? Is it three months, six months is when the peak effect would be? And as another question that, what\u2019s the sort of magnitude? Are we talking 50 bps or 100 bps if it had to pass through at current rates?\nDoug McMillon: Yes, Greg, it happens gradually. And as we mentioned earlier, we started to see increases happen in April and through May. We\u2019ve been really focused on back-to-school receipts. When you have an imported item, you pay the tariff at the time it comes through customs. And so the cost is higher. Even if the tariff rate comes down later, the cost has been elevated. So I wouldn\u2019t think of this as a moment-in-time necessarily, except when you think about seasonal things like back-to-school. So I think it will feel more gradual. And as we\u2019ve been saying to everyone, the first thing that goes through my mind is food inflation. We\u2019ve been through a number of years here where prices have gone up on food and our customers have felt that and they don\u2019t want any more food inflation.\nAnd so what we hope happens is that there are changes from a policy point of view that help us get prices back ex-tariffs on bananas and things that we don\u2019t grow here. So food inflation is very much on our mind. And as it relates to GM, it will vary by category, which country is it. If it\u2019s from China, obviously, it will have a higher amount and this reset of costs will play out through the year. We\u2019ll have seasonal items that will be higher than they would have been otherwise. So I think what we\u2019re looking at is upward pressure that began in April and plays through the entire year on things that are imported. And again, we\u2019ve been working for years to try and make sure that we\u2019ve got surety of supply. We\u2019re sourcing from the right places, create a more flexible supply chain, and we\u2019ve made progress on that.\nAnd I think relative to others, we\u2019re well positioned.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nKrisztina Katai: Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the evolution of marketplace and specifically what your strategic priorities are for the current fiscal year as it relates to seller additions, where you are looking to expand the depth or breadth of the assortment? And just given the cost of tariffs, how are you thinking about general merchandise elasticity for the in-store business versus marketplace in the back half of the year? Thank you.\nJohn Furner: Hi, Krisztina, it\u2019s John. I think the first thing that is important to note is we want to be flexible for our customers and deliver what they want, when they want it, however they want it to be delivered. And so what you\u2019ll see in the coming months, quarters, and years is a continued focus on expanding our assortment to be able to deliver our customers what they\u2019re looking for without the need of looking at another app or going to another location. Our supply chain capabilities that include our new next-generation fulfillment centers, our ability to use our stores for delivery in a very dense local, low-cost way are all parts of the solution to be able to serve customers flexibly. So assortment would be first. Second, we want to ensure that we have the right suite of services available to our sellers.\nOur sellers need to know where their inventory is, their rate of sale. We have an application they can look at on their phone that tells them a lot of the critical information that they\u2019re going to need. And then third, our sellers who are launching brands, developing brands or selling someone else\u2019s product, they\u2019re looking for ways to connect to relevant customer cohorts that are interested in their products. So being able to use our data to help them access cohorts who are interested in their categories and then advertise through Walmart Connect is a big part of the solution that all of our sellers are going to need. In terms of elasticity, we watch elasticity and we are constantly reforecasting quantities placement. This is something that we do each and every day, every week, every month, every quarter.\nSo there\u2019ll be a period here where we\u2019ll be watching this and we are watching this very closely with much better tools and visibility to know what we own, where it is and where it\u2019s moving. And then we\u2019ll continue to ensure that as just as we talked about earlier, the supply chains continue to flow. We\u2019re in stock for our customers in the store at the counter. We have great quality produce and fresh. And then finally, our fulfillment center inventory is placed well so that if a customer places an order, we\u2019ll be able to deliver it in a very fast manner and meet the promise that we told them.\nKath McLay: And if I can just chime in from an international perspective, like we\u2019re very proud of the progress we\u2019re making in Flipkart. But if I focus on our other marketplace businesses in Canada, Chile, and Mexico, our total marketplace GMV grew over 30% year-on-year. And a lot of that is because we have \u2014 in this quarter, we signed up over 4,000 new sellers in Mexico and Canada. We also launched Walmart Connect for our marketplace sellers in Canada and we\u2019ve seen really high engagement with that. And our SKU count grew over 80% in Canada and Mexico over this last quarter. So a lot of upside and a lot of growth and momentum in our marketplace business across international.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ve reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Doug McMillon for closing remarks.\nDoug McMillon: Thanks again for dialing in and asking great questions. We have momentum and that momentum continues. We feel good about our ability to win with customers to serve them how they want to be served. We\u2019re encouraged by the fact that eCommerce growth across all three segments continues to be strong, all three segments growing more than 20%. Secondarily, we\u2019re strengthening our business model, playing that through regardless of what\u2019s happening with tariffs. The 50% growth in advertising, the 15% growth in membership, I think are really encouraging. And then thirdly, as it relates to the short-term environment, we think we are positioned to manage this as well or better than anybody. We will do our best to serve our customers well to help keep prices low.\nThat\u2019s really important in an environment like this and it\u2019s our purpose. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do. But we believe we can do that while continuing to execute the strategy, change the business model and grow profit faster than sales. So that\u2019s our consistent message, and we\u2019re confident in our plan.\nOperator: This will conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

      "text": "Artificial intelligence is the greatest investment opportunity of our lifetime. The time to invest in groundbreaking AI is now, and this stock is a steal!\nAI is eating the world\u2014and the machines behind it are ravenous.\nEach ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nAI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it\u2019s about to get worse.\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:\n\u201cThe future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nTrump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.\nAnd our company sits in the toll booth\u2014collecting fees on every drop exported.\nBut that\u2019s not all\u2026\nAs Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.\nAI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.\nWhile the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.\nAI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.\nAnd infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.\nThis company has its finger in every pie\u2014and Wall Street is just starting to notice.\nWall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds\u2014without the sky-high valuation.\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.\nAnd that\u2019s for a business tied to:\n- The AI infrastructure supercycle\n- The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs\n- A surge in U.S. LNG exports\n- And a unique footprint in nuclear energy\u2014the future of clean, reliable power\nYou simply won\u2019t find another AI and energy stock this cheap\u2026 with this much upside.\nThis isn\u2019t a hype stock. It\u2019s not riding on hope.\nIt\u2019s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.\nThis is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!\nDisruption is the New Name of the Game: Let\u2019s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.\nAI is the ultimate disruptor, and it\u2019s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.\nThe companies that embrace AI will thrive, while the dinosaurs clinging to outdated methods will be left in the dust.\nAs an investor, you want to be on the side of the winners, and AI is the winning ticket.\nThe Talent Pool is Overflowing: The world\u2019s brightest minds are flocking to AI.\nFrom computer scientists to mathematicians, the next generation of innovators is pouring its energy into this field.\nThis influx of talent guarantees a constant stream of groundbreaking ideas and rapid advancements.\nBy investing in AI, you\u2019re essentially backing the future.\nThe future is powered by artificial intelligence, and the time to invest is NOW.\nDon\u2019t be a spectator in this technological revolution.\nDive into the AI gold rush and watch your portfolio soar alongside the brightest minds of our generation.\nThis isn\u2019t just about making money \u2013 it\u2019s about being part of the future.\nSo, buckle up and get ready for the ride of your investment life!\nAct Now and Unlock a Potential 100+% Return within 12 to 24 months.\nWe\u2019re now offering month-to-month subscriptions with no commitments.\nFor a ridiculously low price of just $9.99 per month, you can unlock our in-depth investment research and exclusive insights \u2013 that\u2019s less than a single fast food meal!\nHere\u2019s why this is a deal you can\u2019t afford to pass up:\n- Access to our Detailed Report on our AI, Tariffs, and Nuclear Energy Stock with 100+% potential upside within 12 to 24 months\n- BONUS REPORT on our #1 AI-Robotics Stock with 10000% upside potential: Our in-depth report dives deep into our #1 AI/robotics stock\u2019s groundbreaking technology and massive growth potential.\n- One New Issue of Our Premium Readership Newsletter: You will also receive one new issue per month and at least one new stock pick per month from our monthly newsletter\u2019s portfolio over the next 12 months.

Consider that in 2024, market bulls were boasting about 24%-plus S&P 500 returns. Few were focused on the broad market index's 1.2% dividend yield. But dividends are an important element of return, and 2025 is bearing that out. Through May, the S&P 500 was up a thin 1.1%; without dividends, there was essentially no returns at all. Indeed, dividend income accounted for 42% of the total return of the S&P 500 between 1930 and 2012, according to Hartford Funds. And that's just the average. In some of those decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for a smaller portion of returns, at around 15%-20%. Not for nothing, in 2022, dividend payments softened the blow when most market indices turned bearish as the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates. We saw that pattern in 2018 as well. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between the two main investment categories: high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks. High-yield stocks typically have dividends that pay out in the 5%-8% range. Though the income appears attractive, the share prices of high-yield stocks may be at risk. Indeed, if interest rates drift higher, risk-averse equity investors could be drawn to the relative safety of bonds and may sell their high-yield stocks. In addition, it is worth noting that a yield in the 7%-10% range could signal a company is struggling and the dividend is in jeopardy. Former blue-chip companies such as 3M, General Electric, Boeing, and Kraft Heinz cut their high dividends in the past few years. Lastly, high dividend payouts likely constitute a high percentage of the cash a company earns, leaving little behind for management to deploy into value-enhancing activities. Dividend-growth stocks typically have lower yields, often in the 1.0%-2.5% range. But the lower-yielding dividends are not likely to be a huge component of cash flow, opening up other value-additive options for deploying to cash management teams -- such as share buybacks, M&A, the repayment of debt, or reinvestment in the core business. Further, while the yields are not as high, management teams may be more likely to boost the payouts over time, as earnings grow. Below is a list of the Argus BUY-rated stocks that were recently added to our Dividend Growth Model Portfolio.\nDaily \u2013 Vickers Top Buyers & Sellers for 06/30/2025\nThe Vickers Top Buyers & Sellers is a daily report that identifies the five companies the largest insider purchase transactions based on the dollar value of the transactions as well as the five companies the largest insider sales transactions based on the dollar value of the transactions."
