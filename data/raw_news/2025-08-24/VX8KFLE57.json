  "title": "Failed Nuclear Vote Leaves Taiwan in an Energy Conundrum",
  "description": "The upshot is a defeat that, according to analysts like William Yang at the International Crisis Group, still sends a significant message on changing public perceptions.  \u201cThis result, even though it falls short of the legal threshold, showcases the gap between the government\u2019s preferred policy line and the public opinion,\u201d Yang said.",
  "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 The failure of a weekend vote to restart a key nuclear plant in Taiwan is an apparent win for the island\u2019s ruling party, but one that leaves the government scrambling to satisfy energy security concerns and the growing demands of a vital chip industry.\n\u2022 We Need a Reality Check on Crime, Safety and Transit\n\nSome 74% of those who voted in a referendum backed the return of the Maanshan nuclear plant, shuttered earlier this year. That\u2019s a significant change from 2021, when voters struck down a proposal to open the mothballed Lungmen plant. Still, the affirmative vote did not meet the threshold of 25% of eligible voters required for the opposition-backed referendum to pass and, ultimately, to provide a route to the widespread use of atomic power.\n\nThe upshot is a defeat that, according to analysts like William Yang at the International Crisis Group, still sends a significant message on changing public perceptions.\n\n\u201cThis result, even though it falls short of the legal threshold, showcases the gap between the government\u2019s preferred policy line and the public opinion,\u201d Yang said. \u201cIt also reflects the public\u2019s anxiety and concern about Taiwan\u2019s energy resilience and capability to maintain stable energy supply.\u201d\n\nThe debate over the future of nuclear power in Taiwan has been a challenging one for President Lai Ching-te.\n\nHis Democratic Progressive Party has long opposed any change, given concerns around waste disposal and accidents, but it is now left to deal with the risk that comes with importing 96% of the self-governed democracy\u2019s energy. That\u2019s a dependence on seaborne cargoes that leaves the island \u2014 and a globally vital chip industry, including companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. \u2014 vulnerable in the event of a Chinese blockade.\n\nRestarting Taiwan\u2019s mothballed nuclear power plants is one of the key things the government should do to bolster its energy security against threats from China, according to two top former US security officials who were said to have made the recommendations to Lai recently.\n\nIt also runs counter to a global nuclear renaissance, as nations race to fuel artificial intelligence infrastructure and meet climate-change emissions targets. Jensen Huang, chief executive officer of Nvidia Corp., said during a stopover in Taipei last week that nuclear power is an \u201cexcellent option\u201d for Taiwan. Taiwan\u2019s power demand is projected to rise 13% by the end of the decade, largely driven by data centers and chipmakers.",
