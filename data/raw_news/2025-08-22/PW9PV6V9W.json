  "content": "SpaceX launched an unmanned, robotic spaceplane to orbit for the U.S. Space Force in the USSF-36 mission on Thursday night.\n\nThe Falcon 9 carrying the spaceplane lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida shortly before midnight, with the rocket\u2019s night flight producing a dazzling fireworks show immediately after stage separation.\n\nThe moment was captured by news outlet NASASpaceflight and shared on social media. Stick with it, as things really kick off just past the 20-second mark (in the bottom video).\n\nThe dramatic footage clearly shows the boost-back burn of the Falcon 9 rocket\u2019s first stage.\n\nThe spectacular \u201cFalcon 9 nebula\u201d \u2014 so called because of its similarity to the colorful gaseous clouds in deep space \u2014 is created by the boost-back burn\u2019s exhaust plume as three of the rocket\u2019s nine Merlin engines briefly reignite high in Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\n\nThe maneuver takes place just after the booster separates from the upper-stage carrying the payload, in this case the spaceplane. The critical process initiates the booster\u2019s return to the landing site around five minutes later.\n\nBringing the first-stage booster back to Earth and landing it upright back at the launch site, or on a droneship in the ocean, allows SpaceX to reuse the vehicle multiple times, saving on costs and enabling a higher launch frequency.\n\nThe Falcon 9 left the launchpad at 11:50 p.m. ET on Thursday in the sixth flight for this particular first-stage booster, which previously launched NROL-69, CRS-32, GPS III-7, and two Starlink missions. The booster landed safely back at Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nThe USSF-36 mission marked the eighth launch of NASA\u2019s X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV-8) and the third Falcon 9 launch of the spacecraft, after SpaceX previously launched OTV-5 and OTV-7 (USSF-52).\n\nThe commercial spaceflight company is set for a big day on Sunday when it launches the massive Starship rocket for the 10th time. If you\u2019re interested in witnessing what promises to be another breathtaking launch, Digital Trends has all the information you need.",

      "text": "SpaceX is targeting Sunday for two important launches that will take place about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) apart.\nMost of the attention is fixed on the 10th launch of SpaceX\u2019s massive Starship rocket, which should leave the launchpad near Boca Chica, Texas, in the early evening.\nBut in the early hours of Sunday, SpaceX is also preparing to launch its 33rd commercial resupply mission to the International Space Station (ISS) using its trusty Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft.\nThe Dragon will be filled with more than 5,000 pounds of supplies for the crew aboard the ISS, which orbits around 250 miles above Earth.\nBesides plenty of food, the consignment will also include a number of experiments for crew members to work on, such as bone-forming stem cells for studying bone loss prevention, and materials to 3D print medical implants that could advance treatments for nerve damage on Earth, NASA said.\nWhile docked at the station, the Dragon vehicle will also perform a reboost demonstration to help the ISS maintain its current altitude.\n\u201cThe hardware, located in the trunk of Dragon, contains an independent propellant system separate from the spacecraft to fuel two Draco engines using existing hardware and propellant system design,\u201d NASA explained. \u201cThe boost kit will demonstrate the capability to help sustain the orbiting lab\u2019s altitude starting in September with a series of burns planned periodically throughout the fall of 2025.\u201d\nIt added that the Dragon first demonstrated these capabilities in November last year during the 31st commercial resupply mission.\nHow to watch the launch\nSpaceX is aiming to launch the Falcon 9 from Cape Canaveral, Florida, at 2:45 a.m. on Sunday, August 24. You can watch the rocket lift off via a livestream on NASA+, Netflix, Amazon Prime, as well as on SpaceX\u2019s X account.\nWhat about the docking?\nThe Dragon will dock with the ISS at about 7:30 a.m. (ET) on Monday, August 25, to the forward port of the space station\u2019s Harmony module. You can watch the spacecraft\u2019s arrival on NASA+, Netflix, and Amazon Prime.\nThe spacecraft is expected to stay docked at the ISS until December when it will depart and return to Earth with research equipment and cargo, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California."

      "text": "SpaceX is close to launching its enormous Starship rocket for the 10th time.\nThe spaceflight company recently announced that it\u2019s targeting Sunday, August 24, for the highly anticipated launch.\nComprising the upper stage Starship spacecraft and first-stage Super Heavy booster, the rocket will launch from SpaceX\u2019s Starbase facility in Texas.\nOnce fully operational, NASA and SpaceX hope to use the 121-meter-tall Starship rocket for crew and cargo missions to the moon and possibly even Mars. First up, NASA wants to use a modified version of the spacecraft to return humans to the lunar surface in the Artemis III mission, which is currently set for 2027. But with testing of the Starship ongoing, that date may slip.\nSpaceX has designed the Starship to be a fully reusable rocket, allowing it to use both the booster and spacecraft for multiple missions, thereby saving massively on mission costs.\nHow to watch\nSpaceX is targeting 6:30 p.m. (7:30 p.m. ET) on Sunday, August 24, for the 10th Starship launch from the company\u2019s Starbase facility near Boca Chica, Texas.\nThe livestream, which will begin about half an hour before launch, will be available on SpaceX\u2019s X account.\nTechnical issues or adverse weather conditions could prompt SpaceX to launch later, so be sure to check back here \u2014 or SpaceX\u2019s X account \u2014 for the latest information.\nWhat to expect\nWhether you\u2019re there in person or watching online, you\u2019ll witness the world\u2019s most powerful rocket climbing skyward, generating around 17 million pounds of thrust as the huge rocket leaves the launchpad.\nSpaceX will livestream the launch and early part of the flight, with cameras attached to both the Super Heavy booster and Starship spacecraft tracking the mission\u2019s progress.\nUnlike some earlier Starship flights, the Super Heavy will not be returning to the launch tower after liftoff. Instead, cameras will capture footage of both parts of the vehicle coming down in their respective splashdown sites.\nOne more thing \u2026\nSpaceX chief Elon Musk has promised to give an update on the company\u2019s plans for the Starship shortly before the 10th flight takes place. The event will likely involve Musk speaking from a stage at Starbase. We\u2019ll update here when SpaceX confirms a start time for the event."

      "text": "The U.S. Air Force\u2019s secretive X-37B space plane has bagged a prestigious trophy awarded annually for outstanding U.S. achievements in aviation and space.\nBoeing, which designed and built the reusable, autonomous orbital vehicle, this week joined the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to receive the Collier Trophy from the National Aeronautic Association.\nThe plane earned the honor for \u201cadvancing the performance, efficiency, and safety of air and space vehicles,\u201d as well as for \u201cchanging access to space and serving as the nation\u2019s workhorse in space experimentation and technology.\u201d It comes in the wake of the X-37B\u2019s groundbreaking mission that ended in 2019 after a record 780 days in low-Earth orbit.\nThe outing beat its previous record, set in 2017, by 63 days. It was originally designed for missions of no more than 270 days.\n\u201cUnderscoring the importance of space to the nation, the Collier Trophy celebrates the record-setting mission of the X-37B,\u201d Barbara Barrett, Secretary of the Air Force, said in a release.\nNow on its sixth mission\nSince embarking on its maiden outing in 2010, the program has so far logged more than 2,865 days and traveled more than one billion miles across six missions, with the latest one, which launched in May 2020, still underway.\nCommenting on the award, Leanne Caret, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security, said members of her team felt \u201ctruly honored\u201d that the X-37B had been recognized, adding that \u201cnot only have they earned a place among our industry\u2019s legends through their commitment to innovation and performance, but their accomplishments will influence the next generation of space and aerospace development for the benefit of all humanity.\u201d\nThe X-37B orbital test vehicle looks a lot like the now-decommissioned Space Shuttle, though at just 8.8 meters (29 feet), it\u2019s about a quarter the length.\nA fair bit of mystery surrounds the X-37B and its missions, with the aircraft described by the USAF as being part of \u201can experimental test program\u201d aimed at demonstrating various technologies and \u201coperating experiments which can be returned to, and examined, on Earth.\u201d\nDespite the classified nature of much of its work, we learned that during its record-breaking mission in 2019, the plane spent some of its time in space testing a number of technologies, among them advanced guidance, navigation and control; thermal protection systems; lightweight electromechanical flight systems; advanced propulsion systems; and autonomous orbital flight, re-entry, and landing.\nThe X-37B has been the subject of controversy, too, with some accusing the U.S. of using it to spy on China\u2019s Tiangong-1 space station module when it was in operation. However, various experts have disputed this, claiming their respective orbits were out of sync to such a degree that a mission of this nature would have been unachievable.\nThe Collier Trophy was first awarded in 1911 and has previously gone to Orville Wright, the Apollo 11 lunar landing team, Boeing aircraft, and the International Space Station, among others."
