  "description": "Autodesk, Hims & Hers Health, and Affirm are attractive technology stocks to add to your growth stock portfolio.",
  "content": "\u2022 Autodesk\u2019s design software is gaining popularity, and the company continues to grow both its top and bottom lines.\n\u2022 Hims & Hers Health turned profitable last year as its digital health platform continued to gain traction.\n\u2022 Affirm Holdings is witnessing healthy volume growth for its \"buy now, pay later\" services and other flexible loan options.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Autodesk \u203a The technology sector can be one of the best places to invest your money. With the digitalization trend gaining popularity and the rapid advancements taking place in artificial intelligence, the sector promises steady growth over the long term. If you're looking for growth stocks suitable for long-term ownership, there are several characteristics you'll want them to possess. Among them are a robust business model, a solid track record of financial growth, and healthy business prospects. Here are three choice technology stocks that have all of those qualities, and that should sit well within your long-term growth stock portfolio. Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK) provides a cloud platform and software like AutoCAD that helps designers, engineers, and builders tap into data to design and build the infrastructure of the world around us. The company's software is seeing higher uptake, and its revenues and net income have been climbing steadily in recent years. In its fiscal 2026 first quarter, which ended April 30, Autodesk experienced healthy business momentum, with revenue rising 15.2% year over year to $1.6 billion and operating profit (excluding restructuring charges) climbing 13% to $338 million. Net income would have been 2% higher than in the prior-year period if one-off items were excluded, and free cash flow rose 21.2% to hit $549 million. Billings, which are a measure of future revenue, leapt 29% to $1.4 billion. Autodesk forecasts its revenue for fiscal 2026 to come in around $6.9 billion, which would amount to a 12.5% increase. Free cash flow is also expected to be much stronger than it was in fiscal 2025, in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. The company recently unveiled a refreshed brand strategy, and earlier this month, it launched a cheaper version of its Lite plan for Autodesk Flow Studio to make its software more accessible to a wider customer base. This software utilizes artificial intelligence to automate complex tasks involving video motion capture and character animation to enable creators to focus on telling their stories rather than obsessing over technical details.\n\nWith these moves, the company looks set to continue its growth into the foreseeable future as it garners a wider customer base with its cloud software and tools. Hims & Hers Health (NYSE: HIMS) operates a digital wellness platform that connects people to licensed healthcare providers who offer personalized treatment plans. The business has experienced significant traction in recent years, with revenue nearly tripling from 2022 to 2024. It also turned profitable last year and saw its free cash flow go from negative to strongly positive. In the first half of 2025, Hims & Hers reported continued strong growth with revenue soaring 90% year over year to $1.13 billion. Operating income more than quadrupled to $84.6 million while net income stood at $92 million, up more than threefold. However, the digital health company's free cash flow turned negative as it boosted its capital expenditures to support its aggressive expansion plans. The business experienced healthy subscriber growth of 31% year over year to 2.4 million as of the end of the second quarter. Hims & Hers has an ambitious target to grow revenue to at least $6.5 billion by 2030, and will rely on five growth pillars to achieve this: increasing personalization, expanding into promising specialties, providing follow-up care, global platform expansion, and inking strategic partnerships to extend its ecosystem. The company is also relying on acquisitions to power its growth. Back in June, Hims & Hers acquired Zava, a digital health platform based in Europe, to expand the company's footprint in the United Kingdom and accelerate its expansion into countries such as Germany, France, and Ireland. A month later, Hims & Hers announced the launch of its affordable weight loss program in Canada. The company's personalized healthcare plans should endear it to existing and potential customers, and allow it to continue growing in an increasingly digitalized world. Payments company Affirm Holdings (NASDAQ: AFRM) offers \"buy now, pay later\" services and other alternative payment options for consumers and merchants. Its flexible platform and services have been gaining popularity, and its revenues have surged in recent years. Free cash flow also turned positive in its fiscal 2024, and metrics such as gross merchandise value and active customers also continued to rise. The first nine months of fiscal 2025 saw continued growth in Affirm's financial and operating metrics. Revenue grew 41% year over year to $2.3 billion, while free cash flow more than doubled to $578.2 million. Gross merchandise value in its fiscal 2025 third quarter (which ended March 31) stood at $8.6 billion, 36% higher than the $6.3 billion it logged in the prior-year quarter. Total transactions through Affirm's platform also climbed 45% to 31.3 million. Active customers continued their climb, hitting 21.9 million. This steady growth in active customers and gross merchandise value showcases the popularity of Affirm's myriad payment solutions. The company's active merchant count has also been rising, going from just 246 two years ago to 358 in its latest quarter. The growth of both consumers and merchants promotes a virtuous cycle that should help attract more customers and merchants to its payment ecosystem. Earlier this month, Affirm expanded its partnership with Stripe to enable buy now, pay later integration on Stripe's terminals. These initiatives, along with healthy growth momentum in gross merchandise value, merchants, and consumers, should enable Affirm to steadily grow its top line and free cash flow in the medium term. Should you invest $1,000 in Autodesk right now? Before you buy stock in Autodesk, consider this: The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Autodesk wasn\u2019t one of them.

      "text": "The technology sector is vast, comprising gadget makers, software developers, wireless providers, streaming services, semiconductor companies, and cloud computing providers, to name just a few. Any company that sells a product or service heavily infused with technology likely belongs to the tech sector.\nWhat are tech stocks?\nWhat are tech stocks?\nHardware Companies\nThese design and build devices such as:\n- Personal computers\n- Networking servers\n- Semiconductors\n- Smartphones\n- Fitness trackers\n- Smart speakers\n- Enterprise equipment, such as servers and networking gear\nSoftware Companies\nThese design the software that runs on hardware, such as:\n- Operating systems\n- Databases\n- Cybersecurity software\n- Productivity software\n- Cloud computing providers\n- Artificial intelligence (AI)\nSoftware companies are increasingly moving to a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model in which customers buy a subscription to a program instead of a one-time license. The arrangement generates recurring revenue for the software company.\nSemiconductor chips largely power the hardware. Semiconductor companies design and/or manufacture central processing units, graphics processing units (GPUs), memory chips, and a wide variety of other chips that help to run today's devices.\nTelecom companies that provide wireless services support the tech sector, but actually belong to the communications sector; so do the video streaming companies that provide easy access to high-quality content, and the cloud computing providers that power those streaming services.\nOur list of stocks\nThe best tech stocks in 2025\nMany of the most valuable companies in the world are technology companies. Here are three of the most dominant and largest tech stocks that investors should consider:\nMicrosoft (MSFT -0.04%) is a dominant software company known for its Windows PC operating system and Office productivity software. Microsoft is also the second-largest provider of cloud infrastructure.\nApple (AAPL -0.55%) makes the iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers. Intense customer loyalty ensures plenty of repeat customers, and a growing array of services makes Apple's ecosystem sticky.\nNvidia (NVDA -0.37%) is the premier manufacturer of semiconductors and advanced GPUs critical for not only gaming, but also for AI applications.\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) are not technically tech stocks, despite often being lumped in with them.\nThese stocks actually belong to the communications (Meta and Alphabet) and consumer discretionary sectors (Amazon), despite their tech-heavy products and services.\nThe current market\nTech stocks in the current market\nTechnology stocks, as tracked by the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK -0.38%), which follows S&P 500 technology stocks, have strongly outperformed over the past five years.\nWhile market conditions had favored high-beta assets like tech stocks, which enjoyed magnified returns in the generally bullish market environment, the market turned bearish in early 2025. Through the first two months of the year, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 dipped 1.4% and 0.5%, respectively.\nSeveral macroeconomic factors have contributed to this underperformance. Inflation appears to be cooling, but consumer spending waned at the start of 2025, a sign that many interpret as a harbinger of a market downturn.\nDuring times like these, growth stocks, including technology companies, become less appealing to investors, who instead turn to more conservative options such as stocks in the utilities and consumer staples sectors.\nDespite the recent underperformance of the tech sector, the market remains keenly focused on tech stocks that have a focus on artificial intelligence (AI). Multiple companies have committed to accelerating their AI spend or are in the process of commercializing more AI products. Here are a few highlights:\n- Nvidia: Nvidia has seen massive increases in quarterly revenue, largely driven by data center revenue for generative AI training and inference. In the fourth quarter of 2025, for example, Nvidia reported record quarterly data center revenue of $35.6 billion, a year-over-year increase of 93%. Nvidia's GPUs are at the forefront of the AI revolution, making it a key player in the tech sector.\n- Microsoft: Microsoft has reported double-digit growth in revenue, operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share (EPS). This growth is largely attributed to the integration and use of AI in its products, such as Copilot which is driving stronger AI integration and increased usage of Microsoft Cloud, including Azure and Intelligent Cloud. Microsoft returned $9.7 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025.\n- Apple: In February 2025, Apple announced its plan to spend $500 billion developing projects located in the United States over the next four years, including development of an advanced manufacturing facility in Houston. Expected to open in 2026, the Houston facility will produce servers that support the company's AI initiative, Apple Intelligence.\nRelated investing topics\nAnalyzing tech stocks\nHow to analyze tech stocks\nFor mature tech companies that produce profits, the price-to-earnings ratio is a useful metric. Divide stock price by per-share earnings, and you get a multiple that tells you how highly the market values the company's current earnings. The higher the multiple, the more value the market is placing on future earnings growth.\nMany tech companies aren't profitable, so the price-to-earnings ratio isn't a good metric to evaluate them. Revenue growth matters more for younger companies. If you're investing in something unproven, you want to make sure it has solid growth prospects.\nFor unprofitable tech companies, it's also important that the bottom line be moving from losses toward profits. As a company grows, it should become more efficient, especially when it comes to the sales and marketing spending necessary to close deals. If it's not, or if spending is growing as a percentage of revenue, that could indicate something is wrong.\nUltimately, a good tech stock is one that trades at a reasonable valuation, given its growth prospects. Accurately figuring out those growth prospects is the hard part. If you expect earnings to skyrocket in the coming years, paying a premium for the stock can make sense. But if you're wrong about those growth prospects, your investment may not work out.\nInvesting in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that focuses on tech stocks is one way to avoid making mistakes. The iShares Expanded Tech Sector ETF (IGM -0.32%) is a comprehensive option at a 0.41% expense ratio.\nInvesting in tech stocks can be risky, but you can reduce your risk by investing only when you feel confident their growth prospects justify their valuations."

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement.

      "text": "Investing in growth stocks can be a great way to earn life-changing wealth in the stock market. The key, of course, is to know which growth stocks to buy and when.\nDespite increased volatility in the stock market in 2025, growth stocks continue to outperform. The S&P 500 Growth index climbed about 12% through the first seven months of the year. Its counterpart, the S&P 500 Value index, was up just 3% during the same period.\nHowever, growth stocks don't always outperform during periods of volatility. In 2022, the S&P 500 Growth index fell 30% for the year, while the S&P 500 index dropped just 19%.\nPicking the right growth stock can help you weather the downside while profiting in the long run from its potential. Here's a handy guide to help you get started investing in growth stocks. With these tools and strategies, you can position your portfolio for long-term success with growth stocks.\nOverview\nWhat is a growth stock?\nGrowth stocks are companies that increase their earnings faster than the average business in their industry or the market as a whole.\nOften, a growth company has developed an innovative product or service that is gaining share in existing markets, entering new markets, or creating entirely new industries. The market tends to reward businesses that can grow faster than average for long periods, delivering handsome returns to shareholders in the process. The faster they grow, the bigger the potential returns.\nUnlike value stocks, high-growth stocks tend to be more expensive than the average in terms of profitability ratios. Despite their premium price tags, the best growth stocks can still deliver fortune-creating returns to investors.\nThat said, growth stocks can be much more volatile. In 2022, they took a beating in the market. Despite strong performances in 2023 and 2024, the S&P 500 Growth index total returns still lagged the returns of the broader index over the three-year period.\nHigh inflation puts pressure on growth stocks because it reduces the future value of their expected earnings. Supply chain constraints also affect the ability of some to expand, and other macroeconomic factors slow the entire economy. However, downturns can give long-term investors a buying opportunity when growth stock prices are low.\nTen growth stocks\nTop growth stocks in 2025\nTo provide you with some examples, here are 10 excellent growth stocks available in the stock market today.\n| Company name | Company ticker | Market cap | Industry |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Meta Platforms | NASDAQ:META | $1.9 trillion | Interactive Media and Services |\n| Shopify | NASDAQ:SHOP | $178 billion | IT Services |\n| Uber Technologies | NYSE:UBER | $195 billion | Road and Rail |\n| Block | NYSE:XYZ | $45 billion | Diversified Financial Services |\n| MercadoLibre | NASDAQ:MELI | $118 billion | Multiline Retail |\n| Nvidia | NASDAQ:NVDA | $4.3 trillion | Semiconductors and Semiconductor Equipment |\n| Netflix | NASDAQ:NFLX | $516 billion | Entertainment |\n| Amazon | NASDAQ:AMZN | $2.4 trillion | Multiline Retail |\n| Salesforce | NYSE:CRM | $236 billion | Software |\n| Alphabet | NASDAQ:GOOG | $2.4 trillion | Interactive Media and Services |\nAs this list shows, growth stocks come in all shapes and sizes. They can be found in a variety of industries, both within the U.S. and international markets. Although all the stocks on this list are from larger businesses, smaller companies can also be fertile ground for growth investors.\nA great way to invest in a wide variety of small-cap growth stocks is via an exchange-traded fund (ETF), such as Vanguard Small-Cap Growth Index Fund ETF (VBK 0.17%). This fund tracks the performance of the CRSP U.S. Small Cap Growth Index, which gives investors an easy way to invest in roughly 560 small-cap growth companies all at once.\nThe Vanguard Small-Cap Growth Index Fund ETF has an ultra-low expense ratio of 0.07%. This means investors will receive almost all the fund's returns, with only a small amount in fees going to Vanguard. (An annual expense ratio of 0.07% works out to only $0.70 in fees per $1,000 invested annually.)\nWhere to look\nHow to find growth stocks\nTo find great growth stocks, you'll need to:\n- Identify powerful long-term market trends and the companies best positioned to profit from them.\n- Narrow your list to businesses with strong competitive advantages.\n- Further narrow your list to companies with large addressable markets.\nIdentify trends\nIdentify trends and the companies driving them\nCompanies that capitalize on powerful long-term trends can increase their sales and profits for many years, generating wealth for their shareholders along the way. Here are some examples, along with the companies that can help you profit from those trends:\nE-commerce\nAs more people shop online, Amazon, Shopify, and Etsy (ETSY -3.54%) are well positioned to profit within the U.S. (and many international markets). MercadoLibre holds a leading share of the online retail market in Latin America. Despite the consistent presence of brick-and-mortar retail, e-commerce still has tons of growth potential as an industry.\nDigital advertising\nMeta (formerly Facebook) and Alphabet (which owns Google) own the lion's share of the digital ad market and are poised to profit handsomely as marketing budgets shift from TV and print to online channels. Amazon has built a massive advertising business, which continues to expand into new formats. Even Netflix has come around to advertising to increase its subscriber base and boost its revenue.\nDigital payments\nPayPal (PYPL -0.82%) and Block are helping accelerate the global shift from cash to digital payment forms by allowing businesses of all sizes to accept debit and credit card transactions and giving consumers easier access to cashless payments.\nCloud computing\nComputing power is migrating from on-premise data centers to cloud-based servers. Amazon's and Google's cloud infrastructure services help make this possible, while Salesforce provides some of the best cloud-based enterprise software available. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) will require vast amounts of computing power that cloud providers are ready, willing, and able to offer.\nCloud Computing\nCord-cutting and streaming entertainment\nMillions are canceling their cable subscriptions and replacing them with less expensive and more convenient streaming options. As the global leader in streaming entertainment, Netflix offers a great way to profit from this trend, but it faces growing competition from other media companies.\nElectric and autonomous vehicles\nThe world is shifting from its reliance on gasoline to using electricity to power vehicles. According to a survey of industry executives, half of all auto sales could be electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030. Tesla (TSLA -0.77%) has been the leader in the space with its lineup of vehicles and battery technology. Chinese company BYD's (OTC:BYDDY) (BYDD.F -0.43%) automotive segment has ascended rapidly to become the leading EV maker in the world, thanks to its low-priced vehicles.\nBoth EV makers have made significant progress in developing self-driving technology for their cars. However, Alphabet's Waymo has a clear lead in the space, offering a commercial service in several U.S. cities and completing more than 250,000 rides per week. Uber has emerged as a key partner for autonomous vehicle companies looking to deploy their fleet and maximize their capital utilization, and it could be a hidden beneficiary of the growing number of self-driving cars on the road.\nArtificial intelligence\nCompanies have recently poured billions into accelerating their AI development and applying it to their businesses. Nvidia has been a big beneficiary since it designs the chips used to train many large language models (the foundation of generative AI).\nAlphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft (MSFT -0.04%) also benefit from growth in AI applications since many run on their cloud computing platforms. Salesforce is leveraging its position in enterprise software to help companies use their own data to create AI-powered agents.\nThe key is to try investing in these trends and companies as early as possible. The earlier you get in, the more you stand to profit. However, the most powerful trends can last for many years -- even decades -- giving you plenty of time to claim your share of the profits they create.\nCompetitive advantages\nPrioritize companies with competitive advantages\nIt's also important to invest in growth companies that possess strong competitive advantages. Otherwise, their competitors may pass them, and their growth may not last long.\nCompetitive advantages become especially important during turbulent times, such as during a pandemic or periods of high inflation. A strong competitive advantage will help companies survive and thrive through market downturns, while those without one will struggle.\nWe saw a big sell-off in many tech-focused growth stocks in 2022. Many top growth stocks' share prices were slashed by more than 50%, but some of the biggest stock market losers of the year turned out to be the biggest winners in 2023 and 2024.\nIf you can identify stocks of companies with strong competitive advantages being sold off along with the rest of the market, it can be an opportunity to generate massive returns as they recover. Some competitive advantages are:\n- Network effects: Meta's Facebook is a prime example here. Each person who joins its social media platform makes it more valuable to other members. Network effects can make it difficult for new entrants to displace the current market share leader. Meta's 3.5 billion users across its family of apps certainly make it unlikely that a new social media company will displace it.\n- Scale advantages: Size can be another powerful advantage. Amazon is a great example in this category because smaller rivals will find it extremely difficult to replicate its massive global fulfillment network.\n- High switching costs: Switching costs are the expenses and difficulties associated with switching to a rival's product or service. Shopify, an online retail system for more than 1 million businesses, is a perfect example of a business with high switching costs. Once a company begins using Shopify as the core of its online operations, it's unlikely to go through the hassle of switching to a competitor.\nWhy invest in growth stocks\nWhy invest in growth stocks\nGrowth stocks offer some of the highest return potential of all the companies available in the stock market. As is the case with any individual stock pick, the reason to invest in a growth stock is that you expect it to outperform the overall market. Better yet, if you can find a growth stock trading at a price that mitigates the inherent risks involved in investing in growth stocks, you can do very well with your investment in the long run.\nThe appeal of growth stocks over value stocks and those paying high dividends is that the company's management is given more freedom and flexibility to invest in new opportunities. Without demands on its capital or as much pressure on quarterly profits, management may take a long-term view to grow the value of the business. That will ultimately benefit buy-and-hold investors who patiently stick with the company as it builds the business.\nRelated investing topics\nOpportunity\nFind companies with large addressable markets\nFinally, you'll want to invest in businesses with large addressable markets and long runways for growth still ahead. Industry reports from research firms -- such as Gartner (IT 0.2%) and Insider Intelligence, which provide estimates of industry sizes, projections for growth, and market share figures -- can be very helpful.\nThe larger the opportunity, the larger a business can ultimately become. And the earlier in its growth cycle it is, the longer it can continue to grow at an impressive rate.\nFAQ\nFAQ: Growth stocks\nWhat are growth stocks?\nGrowth stocks are shares of companies expected to increase their revenue and earnings faster than the average business in their industry or the market as a whole. They generally trade for high price multiples and experience more price volatility than the average stock.\nWhat growth stock is going to boom in 2025?\nThe stock market prices future expectations for each company into its stock price. If a company exceeds expectations, it'll likely see its stock price increase. So, the stocks expected to rise the most in 2025 are those that outperform market expectations.\nWhat is an example of a growth stock?\nOne example of a growth stock is Amazon. Its shares are usually considered expensive by traditional valuation measures, like price-to-earnings (P/E) or price-to-sales (P/S) ratios. However, the company continuously invests to grow its business and expand into new markets and industries. The long-term potential profit remains extremely high.\nWhat are the best stocks for growth?\nThe best stocks for growth are usually smaller companies with unique competitive advantages in large or potentially large addressable markets. They are typically expensive relative to their peers, but the company's upside justifies the stock price.\nWhat is the difference between a growth stock and a value stock?\nGrowth stocks tend to exhibit faster and less predictable revenue growth compared to value stocks, which are much more predictable from year to year. Over the long run, growth stocks are expected to grow revenue and earnings much faster than value stocks. Value stocks typically trade based on their valuation, while growth stocks may trade on momentum and how their financial results and management outlooks compare to expectations.\nExpert Q&A on growth stocks\nDr. Preston D. Cherry, PhD, CFP\nThe Motley Fool: What's your best advice on finding high potential stocks like growth stocks?\nDr. Cherry: Because growth stocks tend to operate in a growth business cycle or business sector, finding high potential growth stocks should contain metrics that attempt to confirm or support current growth and best signal sustainable growth patterns. One important feature of a growth company is to ask, \"do they possess a unique business service or product in their sector that provides a valuable moat?\" This service or product is the lifeline of growth where the company needs to market, produce, deliver, and protect better than competitors and new entrants. Performance metrics to consider are whether the company shows historical increases in earnings over select periods and profit margin analysis, which illustrates how a company can manage costs and increase revenues. Other analysis considerations are the technical chart trend characteristics and experienced market analysts' forward growth and price projections.\nThe Motley Fool: Are growth stocks risky?\nDr. Cherry: Investing in individual stocks, in general, contains risk factors such as overall market risk and business risk, among others. The characteristics of growth stocks can make them riskier than their value stock counterparts. As their name suggests, growth stock companies tend to be in a growing business phase. The growing stage could consist of younger and smaller companies with an unproven product or entity track record that tend to use much of their revenues and raised capital to grow the business. These growth characteristics, among others, tend to make growth stocks riskier through higher stock price volatility or reactions to market, company, economic, and political risks, to name a few, thus more significant exposure to downside stock price pressure. However, as investors should avail themselves of the downside cautions of growth stock risk, the upside potential should also be considered. With additional risk comes the prospect of added returns. Because growth companies have the potential for higher company growth rates, growing from earlier business stages to mature business stages, growth stocks could potentially experience higher returns over shorter time horizons. Above all, investors should consider their risk tolerance, capacity, portfolio allocations, and goals to accept the higher risk of growth stocks.\nThe Motley Fool: How do you tell the difference between a growth vs. value stock?\nDr. Cherry: Growth and value stocks tend to differ in a few areas, such as company size, business stage, and revenues to return gains to the shareholder. Growth stocks tend to be in the emerging markets or small or mid-cap company size areas whereas value stock companies tend to be large-cap. The size of companies tends to be the lens of what business stage a company resides. Growth stocks tend to be in the early to mid-business stages, the growth stages (although a small segment of large companies can be growth companies too), and value stock companies tend to be larger, more mature business stage companies. The value stock companies tend to be trading at a discount, \"on-sale,\" or a premium, \"overvalued,\" to their valuation, thus their name, finding value. Growth stock companies tend to reinvest their earnings back into the company and return value to shareholders solely through stock price appreciation. In comparison, value companies may return earnings to investors through a dividend, representing income to an investor and complements stock price appreciation. This income and stock price appreciation mean a total return approach.\nScott Stewart, PhD\nThe Motley Fool: How do you tell the difference between a growth vs. value stock?\nDr. Stewart: The Gordon valuation model is an excellent tool to illustrate the difference between growth and value stocks. Professor Gordon\u2019s model, with some simplifying assumptions, shows that stock prices equal next year\u2019s earnings (e) divided by the expression r \u2013 g, where \u201cr\u201d is a discount rate and \u201cg\u201d is a growth rate. For the same stock price, a lower growth rate necessitates a higher earnings number. Conversely, (illustrated by dividing both sides by e) a high-p/e stock is associated with a high growth rate. Of course, these numbers reflect investor expectations.\nInvestors bid up the p/e ratios of some stocks because, despite low current earnings relative to their market values, they expect earnings to grow at high rates. These are traditionally defined as growth stocks. Tesla stock is a good example of a growth stock, with its 154 p/e multiple and 73% earnings growth rate (using Yahoo Finance data).\nThe Motley Fool: Are growth stocks risky?\nDr. Stewart: Note that a company\u2019s risk is embedded in its discount rate \u201cr.\u201d As a result, companies with stable earnings will justify higher p/e multiples than ones with volatile earnings, other things equal. Clorox, a large-cap, stable-earnings company with only modest growth expectations (basically 0% using Yahoo Finance data) still justifies a p/e of 30 (using next fiscal year\u2019s earnings).\nEmpirical evidence suggests that high-growth stocks underperform low-growth, low-p/e \u201cvalue\u201d stocks over the very long term. For example, the Russell small-cap Value index yielded roughly 3% a year higher than its Growth peer over the forty years ending 2019, and at lower return volatility. One explanation is that investors over-estimate the sustainability of high-growing companies since these \u201cglamour\u201d stocks subsequently fail to deliver on those high expectations. However, there can be long periods in which growth stocks outperform, such as the 10 years ending 2020.\nThe theory and evidence suggest that the key to picking good growth stocks is to identify the ones whose earnings growth rates will accelerate in the short term (increasing the p/e and price) and not disappoint in the long term (sustaining e growth and maintaining a high p/e). For value stocks, some practitioners suggest picking companies that investors have given up on (ones with very low-p/e or other multiples if e is less than zero), that won\u2019t fail in the short-term and will recover in the long-term. Not easy tasks!"

      "text": "The technology sector can be one of the best places to invest your money. With the digitalization trend gaining popularity and the rapid advancements taking place in artificial intelligence, the sector promises steady growth over the long term.\nIf you're looking for growth stocks suitable for long-term ownership, there are several characteristics you'll want them to possess. Among them are a robust business model, a solid track record of financial growth, and healthy business prospects.\nHere are three choice technology stocks that have all of those qualities, and that should sit well within your long-term growth stock portfolio.\n1. Autodesk\nAutodesk (ADSK -0.71%) provides a cloud platform and software like AutoCAD that helps designers, engineers, and builders tap into data to design and build the infrastructure of the world around us. The company's software is seeing higher uptake, and its revenues and net income have been climbing steadily in recent years.\n| Metric | Fiscal 2023 | Fiscal 2024 | Fiscal 2025 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Revenue | $5.01 billion | $5.50 billion | $6.13 billion |\n| Operating income | $989 million | $1.13 billion | $1.35 billion |\n| Net income | $823 million | $906 million | $1.11 billion |\n| Free cash flow | $2.03 billion | $1.25 billion | $1.51 billion |\nIn its fiscal 2026 first quarter, which ended April 30, Autodesk experienced healthy business momentum, with revenue rising 15.2% year over year to $1.6 billion and operating profit (excluding restructuring charges) climbing 13% to $338 million. Net income would have been 2% higher than in the prior-year period if one-off items were excluded, and free cash flow rose 21.2% to hit $549 million. Billings, which are a measure of future revenue, leapt 29% to $1.4 billion.\nAutodesk forecasts its revenue for fiscal 2026 to come in around $6.9 billion, which would amount to a 12.5% increase. Free cash flow is also expected to be much stronger than it was in fiscal 2025, in the range of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. The company recently unveiled a refreshed brand strategy, and earlier this month, it launched a cheaper version of its Lite plan for Autodesk Flow Studio to make its software more accessible to a wider customer base. This software utilizes artificial intelligence to automate complex tasks involving video motion capture and character animation to enable creators to focus on telling their stories rather than obsessing over technical details.\nWith these moves, the company looks set to continue its growth into the foreseeable future as it garners a wider customer base with its cloud software and tools.\n2. Hims & Hers Health\nHims & Hers Health (HIMS 1.23%) operates a digital wellness platform that connects people to licensed healthcare providers who offer personalized treatment plans. The business has experienced significant traction in recent years, with revenue nearly tripling from 2022 to 2024. It also turned profitable last year and saw its free cash flow go from negative to strongly positive.\n| Metric | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Revenue | $527 million | $827 million | $1.48 billion |\n| Operating income | ($68.7 million) | ($29.5 million) | $61.9 million |\n| Net income | ($65.7 million) | ($23.5 million) | $126 million |\n| Free cash flow | ($29.2 million) | $56.3 million | $209 million |\nIn the first half of 2025, Hims & Hers reported continued strong growth with revenue soaring 90% year over year to $1.13 billion. Operating income more than quadrupled to $84.6 million while net income stood at $92 million, up more than threefold. However, the digital health company's free cash flow turned negative as it boosted its capital expenditures to support its aggressive expansion plans.\nThe business experienced healthy subscriber growth of 31% year over year to 2.4 million as of the end of the second quarter. Hims & Hers has an ambitious target to grow revenue to at least $6.5 billion by 2030, and will rely on five growth pillars to achieve this: increasing personalization, expanding into promising specialties, providing follow-up care, global platform expansion, and inking strategic partnerships to extend its ecosystem.\nThe company is also relying on acquisitions to power its growth. Back in June, Hims & Hers acquired Zava, a digital health platform based in Europe, to expand the company's footprint in the United Kingdom and accelerate its expansion into countries such as Germany, France, and Ireland. A month later, Hims & Hers announced the launch of its affordable weight loss program in Canada. The company's personalized healthcare plans should endear it to existing and potential customers, and allow it to continue growing in an increasingly digitalized world.\n3. Affirm Holdings\nPayments company Affirm Holdings (AFRM 1.82%) offers \"buy now, pay later\" services and other alternative payment options for consumers and merchants. Its flexible platform and services have been gaining popularity, and its revenues have surged in recent years. Free cash flow also turned positive in its fiscal 2024, and metrics such as gross merchandise value and active customers also continued to rise.\n| Metric | Fiscal 2022 | Fiscal 2023 | Fiscal 2024 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Revenue | $1.35 billion | $1.59 billion | $2.32 billion |\n| Free cash flow | ($274 million) | ($109 million) | $291 million |\n| Gross merchandise volume | $4.4 billion | $5.5 billion | $7.2 billion |\n| Active consumers | 13 million | 15.6 million | 18.6 million |\nThe first nine months of fiscal 2025 saw continued growth in Affirm's financial and operating metrics. Revenue grew 41% year over year to $2.3 billion, while free cash flow more than doubled to $578.2 million. Gross merchandise value in its fiscal 2025 third quarter (which ended March 31) stood at $8.6 billion, 36% higher than the $6.3 billion it logged in the prior-year quarter. Total transactions through Affirm's platform also climbed 45% to 31.3 million. Active customers continued their climb, hitting 21.9 million.\nThis steady growth in active customers and gross merchandise value showcases the popularity of Affirm's myriad payment solutions. The company's active merchant count has also been rising, going from just 246 two years ago to 358 in its latest quarter. The growth of both consumers and merchants promotes a virtuous cycle that should help attract more customers and merchants to its payment ecosystem. Earlier this month, Affirm expanded its partnership with Stripe to enable buy now, pay later integration on Stripe's terminals. These initiatives, along with healthy growth momentum in gross merchandise value, merchants, and consumers, should enable Affirm to steadily grow its top line and free cash flow in the medium term."
