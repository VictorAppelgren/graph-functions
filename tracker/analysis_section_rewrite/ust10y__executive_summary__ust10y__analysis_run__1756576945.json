      "feedback": "**Feedback & Edit Instructions**\n\n1. **Scope drift** – The draft repeatedly cites mortgage rates, DXY, and tariff policy. Keep only the SPX‑centric narrative; any mention of other assets must be tied explicitly to how they influence SPX (e.g., “a 2‑yr/10‑yr spread widening compresses equity discount rates, pushing SPX down”).  \n2. **Causal chain & magnitude** – Re‑frame each sentence to show the direct transmission:  \n   - Fed dovishness → lower 10‑yr yields (≈ –10 bp) → lower equity discount rate (≈ –0.5 %) → 5–8 % SPX decline over 3–6 mo.  \n   - Robust September payrolls (+200 k) → earlier Fed cut → 10‑yr yield falls 15 bp → SPX up 3–5 %.  \n   - Core PCE > 2.5 % → Fed holds → 10‑yr yield rises 10 bp → SPX down 2–4 %.  \n   Include the sign and range in parentheses (e.g., “spx –5 % to –8 %”).  \n3. **Catalyst windows** – Explicitly list the dates: Fed FOMC 16‑17 Sep 2025, core CPI 15 Sep 2025, payrolls 15 Sep 2025.  \n4. **Watch signals** – Condense to 2‑3 bullet points:  \n   - 2‑yr/10‑yr spread > +70 bp or widening > 10 bp → invalidate base case.  \n   - DXY rise > 2 % → compress valuations → SPX down.  \n   - Core PCE > 2.6 % → 10‑yr yield > 4.30 % → SPX down.  \n5. **Length & format** – Reduce to 4–6 concise sentences or bullets, each with a single claim, magnitude, catalyst, and citation.  \n6. **Citation density** – Replace generic tags with the provided IDs: (FAN5RYW6T), (Z7O1DCHS7), (LF0UUL917), (97MD1FHW8), (1DEM6P1Y2). Ensure every claim has at least one ID.  \n\n**Revised Skeleton (example)**  \n- SPX is projected to fall 5–8 % over 3–6 mo as Fed dovishness lowers the 10‑yr yield by ~10 bp, compressing the equity discount rate (spx –5 % to –8 %, FAN5RYW6T).  \n- A robust September payrolls reading (+200 k) could trigger an earlier Fed cut, flatten the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread by ~10 bp, and lift SPX by 3–5 % (spx +3 % to +5 %, FAN5RYW6T).  \n- Core PCE > 2.5 % into October would keep rates unchanged, raise the 10‑yr yield above 4.30 %, and push SPX down 2–4 % (spx –2 % to –4 %, FAN5RYW6T).  \n- Watch signals: 2‑yr/10‑yr spread > +70 bp or widening > 10 bp, DXY rise > 2 %, core PCE > 2.6 % (97MD1FHW8).  \n- Confidence: 60 % base case, 30 % alternative, 10 % risk scenario (FAN5RYW6T).  \n\nApply these edits to meet the 4–6 sentence limit and keep the focus strictly on SPX.",
