  "content": "Team Cherry has announced that Hollow Knight: Silksong will cost $19.99. The price is $5 more than the original Hollow Knight cost back in 2017, an increase roughly in line with inflation.\n\nThe $20 price point leaked last week via a GameStop listing. Despite the increase over the cost of the original game, the pricing has been warmly welcomed by fans who, by and large, feel it represents great value for a game that's said to be quite substantial, and that the community has been anticipating for seven years.\n\n\"This is not enough to show my appreciation. I have to buy it twice,\" said one user in response to Team Cherry's BlueSky post. Silksong will also be available on day one on Xbox Game Pass.\n\nTeam Cherry also revealed the exact time the game will launch on Sep. 4: 10 a.m. EDT/7 a.m. PDT. If you're surprised it's not a midnight drop, in fact it is \u2014 in Australia, where Team Cherry is based, and where Silksong actually launches at 12 a.m. on Sep. 5.\n\nSilksong's release after years of waiting and dozens of memes has unleashed a wave of hype and caught other indie developers unawares. But Team Cherry said that development was \"never stuck\" and that they were just having too much fun making it.",

      "text": "Hollow Knight: Silksong fans can breathe easy this week knowing that the follow-up to one of the best Metroidvanias of all time is coming out soon. But why, exactly, did it take so long in the first place? The duo behind Team Cherry broke their silence this week, and it turns out that there was never some big, dramatic reason that the game didn't get finished earlier. After selling 15 million copies of Hollow Knight, Team Cherry wanted to get things right for Silksong \u2014 so it took its sweet time ensuring that would be the case.\nIn a report by Jason Schreier at Bloomberg, Team Cherry pulls back the curtain on the creation of its much-anticipated indie game, and while there are no enormous reveals, it's still fascinating to hear the Aussies speak so frankly about a game that's otherwise been shrouded in mystery.\nAs fans are painfully aware, Silksong originally began as a planned piece of DLC for Hollow Knight, but midway through development the plan changed to expand it into a stand-alone release. This was the start of an entire saga that's spawned countless memes and inpatient fans, some of whom turned the wait for Silksong into their online identity. You couldn't have any type of gaming event or livestream without someone crossing their fingers that Silksong would make an appearance. And the longer the game went MIA, the more fervently fans believed next time would totally pay off.\nTurns out, Team Cherry was just having a good time making the game. Maybe too good of a time: At one point, the creative team realized it simply had to stop ideating and expanding the scope of the game. Otherwise, the game would never ship.\n\"I remember at some point I just had to stop sketching,\" says Team Cherry co-founder Ari Gibson, referencing his work crafting concept art for the game. \"Because I went, 'Everything I\u2019m drawing here has to end up in the game. That\u2019s a cool idea, that\u2019s in. That\u2019s a cool idea, that\u2019s in.' You realize, 'If I don\u2019t stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.'\"\nIronically, the longer Silksong took to make, the longer Team Cherry wanted to keep working on it. After all, expectations for the game just kept rising. The team wanted to make sure that Silksong could meet the massive expectations fans had for it. Based on what Team Cherry has shared thus far, the sequel certainly sounds more ambitious than Hollow Knight. Silksong sounds massive: There are multiple towns, and each one has its own set of quests. Hollow Knight, on the other hand, had a single hub.\nAnother factor that probably contributed to the game's lengthy development time was money. Hollow Knight had a similarly extended development circuit, and in some ways it sounded like reason that game only really came out because Team Cherry was otherwise going to run out of money. For Silksong, the team had already sold millions of copies of Hollow Knight. Crucially, the bulk of those 15 million sales happened during the extended wait for Silksong. It seems like the more people hyped Silksong up, the more other bystanders would wonder what, exactly, the fuss was about. In a way, the culture of waiting developed around Silksong was the best possible thing that could've happened to the game, marketing-wise. Big-budget games spend a small fortune trying to amass a fraction of the attention that Silksong garnered by doing absolutely nothing, at least publicly.\nNow that we know why it took so long, the next logical question is this: Can Silksong possibly live up to all that hype? Guess we'll know pretty soon. Here's the kicker, though. The release of Silksong is merely the beginning of a different countdown. Though Team Cherry shared no specifics, it did mention that it's already thinking about what it can add to the game once it's out. The developers already calling their plans \"ambitious\" and they hope they can find a way to bring their ideas to life. What are the chances we'll see history repeat itself? Maybe years from now we'll look back on this as the start of the ordeal for Hollow Knight 3."

      "text": "Attention all vessels: Hollow Knight: Silksong is real and (finally) coming on Sept. 4, developer Team Cherry announced Thursday during a special announcement livestream. We knew it was coming, or at least there were hints of the game during events like the previous Nintendo's Indie World showcase, and there was a demo available at Gamescom this week. But until now, the long-awaited sequel to the original Hollow Knight had proven evasive for most of 2025.\nThe reveal was unfortunately rather short. We see Hornet traversing all sorts of places, and the trailer says she will be ascending to the peak of a vast, haunted kingdom where she will find over 40 bosses. Some of these encounters look epic, too. At one point, Hornet is facing a weird little bugger amid a vast field of white roses. But the critical thing here is that Silksong is out extremely soon. You'll only have to wait a couple of weeks now!\nIt\u2019s been eight years since Team Cherry cursed the world with its vision of a fallen bug kingdom in Hollow Knight, and just as many since fans have been waiting for what happens next. A sequel was announced in 2019, but development turned rocky for the hyped follow-up. While painful for fans, the development mirrors that of the original Hollow Knight, which originally began as a game jam title that blossomed into a full-blown Kickstarter campaign. Team Cherry had originally planned on releasing the game in 2015, only to delay it for two years.\nSilksong began as DLC for Hollow Knight only to be expanded into a stand-alone title, and the switch likely didn\u2019t help the trio of developers stay faithful to the original game plan. Yes, one of the best Metroidvania games to ever exist has largely been the work of a tiny team hailing out of Australia. Taking all of this into consideration, Silksong\u2019s development starts to make a lot more sense, doesn\u2019t it? At least the Silksong memes have kept everyone warm in the interim.\nBetween a Switch 2 announcement and the upcoming playable demo at Gamescom from Microsoft, though, famished Hollow Knight fans are finally eating. You can expect Silksong to take place in an entirely new setting filled with 200 new types of enemies. You\u2019ll control Hornet, a mysterious enemy present throughout Hollow Knight \u2014 and her moveset is way more acrobatic than that of the methodical knight protagonist.\nBeyond Switch 2, Hollow Knight: Silksong is also dropping for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, as well as Microsoft\u2019s upcoming portables, ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. With a release window in sight, it\u2019s probably a great time to play Hollow Knight."

      "text": "Man plans, god laughs \u2014 only in this case, god is a tiny bug with a really sharp sword. Hollow Knight: Silksong comes out Sept. 4, marking the conclusion of a years-long hype cycle. It comes with just two weeks of advance notice. Already, no less than five games have shifted their planned release dates out of next week, some by months. I really only have just one question: What the hell, you guys?\nFirst announced in 2019, Hollow Knight: Silksong started out as an expansion to developer Team Cherry\u2019s incandescently popular Metroidvania, but quickly evolved into a full-sized game. Despite hints in 2022 that it would release within a year, it was delayed indefinitely in 2023, and has largely stayed absent from gaming publicity events since. Along the way, Silksong became a bona fide meme, a staple in subreddits, YouTube chats, and social media feeds. But this isn\u2019t to discount the widespread anticipation: The original Hollow Knight has sold an estimated 15 million copies \u2014 a massive number for any game, let alone an indie.\nIt makes sense that other smaller games would want to steer clear of the impact zone. More than the big studios whose games are buoyed by massive marketing budgets, the life or death of an indie game is often dependent on positive word of mouth during its release week. Let\u2019s imagine, reasonably, that Silksong sucks all the air out of the room upon release. If no one is around to talk about your new game, did it even come out?\nWithin 24 hours of Team Cherry\u2019s announcement, two games slated to release in the same window \u2014 horror game CloverPit and Metroidvania Aeterna Lucis \u2014 were both delayed. Since then, more game companies have followed suit. Publisher Devolver Digital moved Baby Steps, the next game from walking sim maestro Bennett Foddy, back two weeks. Developer Sunny Side Up shifted its cozy game Little Witch in the Woods to Sept. 15. The action roguelike Megabonk is now out on Sept. 18. (Its developer Vedinad called Silksong \u201cpeak\u201d on X.)\nPerhaps the most scathing announcement of a delay came from Demonschool publisher Ysbryd Games, which pushed the Persona-inspired tactics RPG out to Nov. 19 and lamented in a news release, \u201cCrueler still, that we should find out with such short notice.\u201d Demonschool developer Necrosoft Games said in a statement on Bluesky that the delay was a publisher-driven decision, noting: \u201cWe aren't mad at Ysbryd but at the situation. Dropping the GTA of indie games with 2 weeks notice makes everyone freak out.\u201d\nRepresentatives for Team Cherry did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.\nI\u2019m so sorry for the inside baseball, but the surprise announcement of a release date for a game this important also scatters the gaming press. Over the past few weeks, we at Polygon have been sketching out some editorial plans for September. Part of this process involves identifying which games our staff should cover, and then determining which of those staffers actually has the time and bandwidth to cover them appropriately, whether that\u2019s tentpoles like Borderlands 4 or comparatively under-the-radar games like Hirogami. It\u2019s a balancing act. Yes, we strive to devote as much time as we can to unearthing hidden gems you may not have otherwise heard of. We also want to provide coverage of games that we know, thanks to data tools, that Polygon readers love to read about.\nNow Silksong is here. Guess what we\u2019ll devote the bulk of our coverage to? Guess what other sites will likely devote the bulk of their coverage to?\nToo many games come out every month for any one website to write about everything; playing games takes time, writing about games takes time. The games media constantly has to make these sorts of decisions, and Silksong is one of those new releases that\u2019s simply too big not to cover. Media attention smaller publishers could\u2019ve counted on is no longer going to happen as planned. The word of mouth that could\u2019ve at least been estimated is now, for some, silence. (One Polygon writer has devoted hours to playing Demonschool for assignment. That coverage will now be held until we get closer to the game\u2019s November release.)\nOf course, Team Cherry is well within its rights to do what it wants with its new game. And given the buzz around Silksong, no matter how or when it comes out, there\u2019s almost no chance this thing doesn\u2019t light up the charts. But in the years since Hollow Knight first broke indie game containment \u2014 arguably revitalizing an entire subgenre and not-so-arguably inspiring countless clones, not to mention literally millions of fans \u2014 Team Cherry attained great power. Now here\u2019s one for the class: What\u2019s the other half of that phrase?"
