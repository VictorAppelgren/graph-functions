  "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Corey Lewandowski has logged just 69 days as a \u201cspecial\u201d employee of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem \u2014 allowing him to serve another 61, the Trump administration said Thursday after weeks of speculation about Lewandowski apparently blowing past the 130-day limit.\n\nLewandowski, 51, has served as Noem\u2019s de facto chief of staff since late January, and fellow administration aides were puzzled when he remained on the job well past what they believed to be his end date in early June \u2014 leading to theories that he was using colleagues\u2019 badges to clock into work.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security told The Post Thursday that 69 working days had been recorded by Trump\u2019s former 2016 campaign manager, confirming a figure first reported by Axios.\n\n\u201cMr. Lewandowski\u2019s time is kept by a career DHS employee who submits the paperwork on a bi-weekly basis,\u201d the department said.\n\nA White House official hailed plummeting illegal immigration numbers under Noem and Lewandowski\u2019s leadership when asked about his status.\n\n\u201cThe Tremendous results coming from the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 a historically secure border, safer American communities, and successful deportations of criminal illegal aliens \u2014 speak for themselves,\u201d she said.\n\nLewandowski reportedly was denied the permanent role of DHS chief of staff due to widespread allegations that he and Noem, 53, are having an extramarital affair.\n\nBoth are married to other people and have repeatedly denied an improper relationship.\n\nThe pair have traveled extensively together on official business this year, including trips to Argentina, Bahrain, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Poland and Italy.",

ZERO.\u201d\nThe total released by Homan marks a 93.1% drop in nationwide Border Patrol encounters from June 2024, when 87,606 migrants were nabbed trying to enter the country illegally.\nIt\u2019s also a 94% and 97% decline from June 2023 and June 2022, when, respectively, 100,606 and 193,027 migrants were encountered by Border Patrol.\nIn June 2022, the average daily total of migrant encounters was about 6,434 per day.\nLast month, Border Patrol reported encountering just over 10,000 migrants nationwide.\nHoman attributed the massive reduction in border-crossings to President Trump\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration, calling it, \u201cThe Trump Effect.\u201d\n\u201cPresident Trump has created the most secure border in the history of the nation and the data proves it,\u201d the border czar asserted. \u201cWe have never seen numbers this low.

      "text": "Kristi Noem dodges kicks from migrant suspect as she leads ICE deportation raids in Phoenix\nPHOENIX \u2014 Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem isn\u2019t afraid of getting her hands dirty on President Trump\u2019s deportation raids.\nNoem led about 100 federal agents on an early morning raid Tuesday in Arizona\u2019s capital, where they nabbed three illegal migrants wanted on charges from weapons and drug offenses to running a money laundering operation.\nThe Post was there as she dodged kicks from a suspect wearing slip-on shoes and gamely told him, \u201cYou\u2019re not scaring me with your Croc.\u201d\nThe multi-agency task force \u2014 led by Phoenix Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and joined by a coterie of federal law enforcement and immigration agencies \u2014 nabbed three illegal immigrant felons with extensive criminal histories.\nNoem, clad in police tactical gear including a flak jacket, sported her two-tone gold Rolex as she greeted agents from ICE\u2019s Enforcement and Removal Operations, Homeland Security Investigations, the FBI, and the Drug Enforcement Administration in a dingy underground parking garage. She shook hands with officers as she thanked them for their work and pledged to get them the resources they need to do their jobs better.\n\u201cThe effort of cooperation we have between agencies is getting turned onto steroids. We have this being multiplied across the country exponentially, now anyone who\u2019s in this country illegally that\u2019s committing crimes and has broken our laws will face consequences,\u201d Noem told The Post.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be sweeping them up faster than we ever have before.\u201d\nAgents were briefed on the day\u2019s targets before a dozen vehicles rolled out \u2014 with Noem leading the convoy behind the wheel of a BearCat armored SWAT vehicle.\nAlso in the BearCat with Noem was former Trump campaign manager and senior adviser Corey Lewandowski, who introduced himself to the federal agents as \u201cchief of staff.\u201d DHS later clarified that he is an adviser to DHS and a special government employee.\nThe first suspect arrested was Bonifacio Renteria-Cruz, an illegal migrant felon from Mexico with ties to the Sinaloa Cartel, according to DHS. His lengthy rap sheet includes prior convictions for aggravated assault, weapons charges, and an active arrest warrant in Mexico for homicide.\nRenteria-Cruz had been ordered removed by an immigration official in 2008.\nNext on the task force\u2019s chopping block was illegal alien Jose Escobar-Robles, identified as helping run Monroy Enterprises, a money service business believed to be illegally funneling money to Mexico to benefit cartels engaged in drug smuggling and human trafficking.\nAfter he was slapped in cuffs and loaded into the back of a police car, Noem asked him questions about whether he has family as he raised his Croc shoe in an attempt to block out the camera, impatiently imploring the agents, \u201cLet\u2019s go, let\u2019s go.\u201d\nNoem retorted, \u201cYou\u2019re gonna go \u2014 you\u2019re gonna go home, and you\u2019re gonna get prosecuted,\u201d adding, \u201cYou\u2019re not scaring me with your Croc\u201d as he repeatedly kicked his foot in her direction.\nThe final suspect picked up in the raids, Luis Garcia-Sanchez, is allegedly connected to the notorious 18th Street Gang. He was wanted for felony narcotics charges dating back to 1987 and twice ordered removed from the country, DHS said.\nGarcia-Sanchez was barefoot and surrounded by a pungent cloud of pot smoke when agents showed up with the warrant. His wife retrieved his shoes before they loaded him into a waiting police car.\nAs officers led Garcia-Sanchez, 61, away in handcuffs, he told The Post that he was no longer affiliated with the LA-based street gang and that he was a grandfather now.\nHe told Noem from the back of a squad car, sounding somewhat remorseful, that he has three kids, and that he didn\u2019t want them to wind up living the gangbanger lifestyle like their father.\n\u201cGo deal with the consequences of breaking the law here. Give them an example of being a better person,\u201d Noem told a handcuffed Garcia-Sanchez.\nNoem said the raids would continue and were part of stepped-up efforts under the Trump administration to round up migrants \u2014 including those whose primary crime is being in the country illegally.\nShe also highlighted new provisions of the Alien Registration Act of 1940, which were set to go into effect on April 11.\nThe law requires foreign nationals who have been in the US 30 days or longer to register with the federal government or be subject to fines, imprisonment, or deportation.\nAs a result of that act, she said, \u201ceveryone in this country illegally\u201d will be subject to criminal charges.\n\u201cWe\u2019re past the deadline of the Alien Registration Act, so everyone in this country illegally now, it\u2019s a criminal charge. Everyone should know we\u2019re enforcing the act. If you\u2019ve been here longer than 30 days and haven\u2019t registered with the government, we are now coming after you criminally,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThat means we can come into your home and get you, charge you and remove you, and the fines are up to $1,000 a day,\u201d she said, adding that federal agencies are now empowered to use all of the authority at their disposal \u201cto make sure American citizens are the only ones afforded the rights of being in this country.\u201d\n\u201cEverybody else is going to pay consequences for breaking our laws.\u201d\nNoem also referenced the Supreme Court\u2019s lifting of an order blocking the administration from using the Alien Enemies Act, paving the way to deport more criminal migrants to El Salvador\u2019s infamous Terrorism Confinement Center prison, CECOT.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to continue using that act in order to return people from these terrorist organizations to face consequences and be removed from our country,\u201d she said, noting that there\u2019s plenty of room in the facility and more to come.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see us continuing to partner with El Salvador. CECOT has the capacity for 40,000 individuals, and [El Salvador President Nayib Bukele] has said they\u2019ll take as many as we want to send. There\u2019s 14,000 there now, and he said he plans to build another prison right next to it.\u201d"

I\u2019m not getting out of this car. It\u2019s time to go to bed,\u201d he shouts at the officer, before being forcibly removed and booked into the jail shortly before 1 a.m., according to an arrest report retrieved by WCBD.\nMcLeod\u2019s eyes were \u201cextremely bloodshot and highly dilated \u2026 typical of an individual under the influence of a stimulant narcotic,\u201d according to the report.\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear whether McLeod \u2014 who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2010 and served two terms as Charleston County Democratic Party chairman \u2014 was tested for drugs during his arrest.\nHe is facing misdemeanor charges for disorderly conduct.\nHis party leadership is calling on him to step down from the gubernatorial race, in which he is currently the party\u2019s only candidate.\n\u201cAfter reviewing the transcript of the dash cam footage from his recent arrest, it is clear that Mr. McLeod is navigating profound challenges and should focus on his mental and emotional well-being instead of a campaign for governor,\u201d the chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party, Christale Spain, said in a statement Wednesday.\nEvery morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post\u2019s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between. Subscribe here!\n\u201cWe offer him compassion and pray he finds the support he needs.\u201d\nMcLeod\u2019s campaign team did not respond immediately to requests for comment, but he branded his arrest \u201cunlawful\u201d in a recent interview announcing his candidacy.\n\u201cThe only thing I\u2019d ask the voters is to please give me a little bit of grace and know that long before we go to Election Day, they\u2019ll know exactly what happened,\u201d he told the Post and Courier.\n\u201cAnd when they learn what happened around my unlawful arrest, it will be a reason why I absolutely need to be our state\u2019s governor,\u201d he said, adding that he had been exercising his \u201cGod-given, constitutional right to be in a public place\u201d when he was arrested."

Not only is he FIRED, he has been charged with a felony.\u201d\n\u201cThis is an example of the Deep State we have been up against for seven months as we work to refocus DOJ,\u201d she added. \u201cYou will NOT work in this administration while disrespecting our government and law enforcement.\u201d\nDunn worked as an international affairs specialist in the Justice Department\u2019s criminal division \u2014 which handles cases of fugitives abroad and helps foreign countries on extradition matters with their own fugitives, according to the DOJ.\nDunn appeared to have been similar to a paralegal \u2014 assisting attorneys in handling a \u201clarge volume of cases, including the litigation of those matters,\u201d according to the DOJ\u2019s job listing for the position.\nHe does not appear to be an attorney as his name isn\u2019t listed on the DC bar\u2019s website.\nAn attorney for the suspect did not immediately respond to requests for comment and attempts to contact Dunn directly were unsuccessful.\nDunn was allegedly caught on camera berating a group of federal officers as \u201cfascists\u201d before lobbing his deli sandwich and hitting a US Customs and Border Protection agent in the chest.\n\u201cF\u2014 you! You f\u2014ing fascists! Why are you here? I don\u2019t want you in my city!\u201d Dunn allegedly fumed within inches of an officer\u2019s face, per a criminal complaint.\nAccording to the complaint, Dunn successfully attempted to flee on foot, telling a local cop while he was being processed: \u201cI did it. I threw a sandwich.\u201d\nFootage of the incident went viral against the backdrop of President Trump\u2019s deployment of hundreds of federal law enforcement personnel to assist DC police in cracking down on crime.\nDunn faces one count of assaulting, resisting or impeding a federal officer and faces up to one year in prison if convicted.\n\u201cThe police are not out there to get pushed around or beat up,\u201d DC US Attorney Jeanine Pirro declared in announcing the case against Dunn. \u201cHe thought it was funny. Well, he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s funny today because we charged him with a felony: Assault on a police officer.\u201d\n\u201cSo there, stick your Subway sandwich somewhere else!\u201d\nOn Monday, Trump federalized the DC Metropolitan Police Department for 30 days and activated the National Guard to patrol the District\u2019s streets.\nSince then, hundreds of federal officials have arrested more than 100 suspects, with 23 collared on Monday, 43 nabbed on Tuesday and 45 apprehended on Wednesday, according to data from the Trump administration.\nTrump\u2019s crackdown comes after former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee Edward Coristine \u2014 aka \u201cBig Balls\u201d \u2014 was beaten up while intervening to prevent a carjacking last week."

New ways of being that won\u2019t look or sound like they did before.\u201d\nFormer President Joe Biden\u2019s daughter is seeking spousal support from her ex as part of the divorce, court records seen by Radar Online show.\nBiden, executive director of the nonprofit Delaware Center for Justice, is \u201cunable to sustain herself\u201d while the divorce is pending, according to the documents filed by her attorney Charles Meyer.\nShe is requesting a no-fault divorce, claiming that the marriage is \u201cirretrievably broken,\u201d and that the couple are living \u201cseparate and apart,\u201d the documents show.\nBiden and Krein did not respond to requests for comment Thursday.\nThe couple married in 2012 in Greenville, Delaware, two years after meeting through Ashley\u2019s late brother, Beau, who died of cancer in 2015.\nKrein, a New Jersey-born otolaryngologist at Thomas Jefferson University, proposed in 2011 at Big Sur, California.\nThey married at Delaware\u2019s St. Joseph on the Brandywine Roman Catholic Church in a ceremony combining her traditions with Krein\u2019s Jewish ones, before the couple and some 200 guests traveled to the Biden family\u2019s nearby lakeside home in Wilmington for a reception and dinner.\nJoe Biden, who was vice president at the time, personally prepped the house for his youngest child\u2019s wedding.\n\u201cI kept telling Ash, we\u2019ve got to open up the church and practice walking up and down the aisle so I can handle it,\u201d he previously told People.\nHe was also full of praise for his future son-in-law, saying, \u201cThis is the right guy. And he\u2019s getting a helluva woman.\u201d\nKrein also served on the Biden Cancer Initiative\u2019s board of directors between 2017 and 2019, and advised his 2020 presidential campaign on its response to the COVID-19 pandemic in an unofficial capacity.\nAt last year\u2019s DNC in Chicago, Ashley Biden recounted her wedding day and discussed her father\u2019s words to her before she tied the knot.\n\u201cBefore he walked me down the aisle, he turned to me and said he would always be my best friend. All these years later, Dad, you are still my best friend,\u201d she said in an address that brought her father to tears."

      "text": "SD Gov. Kristi Noem having \u2018absurdly blatant and public\u2019 affair with \u2018handsy\u2019 Trump aide Corey Lewandowski, sources say\nMarried Republican South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem has engaged in a years-long affair with longtime Donald Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski, multiple sources told The Post Friday.\nThough no images of the two getting frisky are known to exist, the pair have been less than discreet about their relationship, with one source recalling them making out at a hotel bar during the 2021 Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Fla.\n\u201cI remember it was so absurdly blatant and public,\u201d said the person, who recalled Noem and Lewandowski getting \u201chandsy\u201d at the bar of the Hyatt Regency Orlando with between 100 and 200 others around.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like 2 a.m.,\u201d the source said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t like we caught them at some dive bar miles away. It\u2019s a lobby bar where everyone is staying and so there\u2019s a bajillion political operatives and journalists and electeds around. I remember I saw it with my own eyes and a couple other people saw it and the blatantness was absurd.\u201d\n\u201cThis has been a known, open thing and we\u2019ve all been waiting for it to blow up at some point,\u201d the person added.\nThe liaison emerged one week after Noem, a 51-year-old mom of three, formally endorsed Trump, 77, for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, raising the pitch of speculation that the 45th president would pick her as his running mate.\n\u201cHe\u2019s 100% banging her,\u201d said a second person familiar with the relationship between Noem and Lewandowski, first reported by DailyMail.com.\nThe source added that they personally witnessed Noem \u201csitting on his [Lewandowski\u2019s] lap\u201d and \u201cplaying grab-ass\u201d during an event at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in December 2020.\n\u201cThe usual stuff that drunk people who are having affairs do,\u201d the person said of the interaction.\nAnother person who saw the pair at Mar-a-Lago on the same occasion confirmed, \u201cI saw her on his lap.\u201d\n\u201cI thought they were a couple. They were all over each other,\u201d added this source, who had met Lewandowski before, but was unacquainted with Noem \u2014 whom the witness recalled as otherwise \u201cso beautiful\u201d and \u201cpoised.\u201d\nA fourth source told The Post the dalliance has been widely known in Republican political circles for \u201cyears,\u201d adding that Noem\u2019s husband, Bryon, is said to have moved out of the governor\u2019s mansion in Pierre roughly two years ago.\nBryon Noem runs an eponymous insurance company in Bryant, SD, a couple hours\u2019 drive from the state capital. Details of his current living arrangements are unclear.\nA fifth person told The Post that he and fellow GOP operatives were \u201cwell aware\u201d of the fling and suggested the story finally appeared in print thanks to \u201cone of her competitors for VP.\u201d\nBoth Trump and political pundits have publicly mused for months about potential running mates, with some of the names mentioned including Noem, former Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), former ambassador to Germany Ric Grenell, House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik (R-NY), current GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, and hard-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.).\nNoem herself was once considered a potential 2024 contender but opted not to enter the race, telling Fox News last month that no Republican could win the nomination as long as Trump was running.\n\u201cWhy run if you can\u2019t win?\u201d she asked.\nOn Sept. 8, Noem announced at a rally in Rapid City that she was backing Trump, calling him \u201cthe fighter that our country needs.\u201d\n\u201cYou made America great again once, let\u2019s do it again,\u201d Noem said while introducing the former president.\n\u201cI will do everything I can to help him win and save this country.\u201d\nLewandowski, 49, was Trump\u2019s first 2016 campaign manager and widely credited with engineering his victory in the 2016 New Hampshire primary, which bolstered the real estate mogul after a loss to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in the Iowa caucuses.\nHowever, Lewandowski\u2019s star began to fade after he was accused of manhandling Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields following a Trump press conference in March 2016.\nHe was charged with one count of simple battery, which was later dropped.\nLewandowski was dismissed from the Trump campaign three months later, following reported clashes with then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort.\nHowever, the Massachusetts native remained close to Trump while a private citizen. According to former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report on the Russia investigation, Trump summoned Lewandowski to the Oval Office on June 19, 2017, and ordered him to tell then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to both make a public statement criticizing the probe and direct Mueller to limit the scope of his investigation to future foreign interference in US elections.\nLewandowski arranged a meeting with Sessions, but the AG canceled due to a last-minute conflict. The following month, Trump summoned Lewandowski again and told him that if Sessions did not agree to meet, Lewandowski should tell Sessions he was fired. Lewandowski passed the order to then-White House deputy chief of staff Rick Dearborn, who pocketed it and did not deliver it to Sessions.\nThe former campaign operative has been married since 2005 to wife Allison Hardy, but has been accused of numerous affairs and acting inappropriately with high-profile women in the Trump orbit.\nIn November 2017, pro-Trump singer Joy Villa said Lewandowski had slapped her backside \u201creally hard\u201d at a holiday party. When Villa told him to keep his hands to himself, Lewandowski reportedly told her, \u201cGo ahead, I work in the private sector\u201d \u2014 then smacked her butt again.\n\u201cIt was completely demeaning and shocking,\u201d Villa told Politico at the time.\nLewandowski also reportedly engaged in an on-again, off-again relationship with then-White House communications director Hope Hicks.\nIn 2021, he was removed as chairman of the pro-Trump Make America Great Again Action super PAC after the wife of a major donor to the former president accused him of inappropriate behavior.\nTrashelle Odom told Las Vegas police that Lewandowski asked for her hotel room number and made inappropriate comments about his genitals. At one point in their conversation, Odom told Lewandowski she was from a \u201cbad area\u201d in California.\n\u201cThat is when Lewandowski told me that he \u2018was from a bad part of Boston and have [sic] killed people,\u2019\u201d Odom told the cops. \u201cI initially believed that he was joking and attempted to laugh it off. That is when Lewandowski went into detail and stated something to the effect of, \u2018When I was 10, I stabbed someone over and over again, killing him.\u2019 He continued and shared that when he was older he \u2018stabbed a man in the back of the head, also killing him.\u2019\u201d\nNoem also publicly announced that she was cutting ties with Lewandowski, whom her office called a \u201cvolunteer\u201d adviser. However, DailyMail.com reported that statement was more show than substance.\n\u201cShe fired him without really firing him,\u201d one source told the outlet.\n\u201cHe never left.\u201d\nLewandowski declined to comment on the record for this story.\nA Noem spokesman directed The Post to a statement given to DailyMail.com, which began: \u201cThis is so predictable that you would attack Governor Noem less than a week after she endorsed Donald J. Trump as the 47th President of the United States.\u201d\n\u201cAs Governor Noem said during that endorsement speech: \u2018Yes, I will be attacked for speaking the truth to all of you tonight. Yes, I expect Joe Biden, these candidates, their political operatives, and the media will perpetuate ugly, hateful misinformation in an attempt to destroy me and my family because of my opinions. It\u2019s nothing new. I\u2019m getting used to it, honestly.'\u201d\nEditor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this story quotes a source as saying they saw Noem sitting on Lewandowski\u2019s lap at Mar-a-Lago in March 2020. In fact, the sighting took place in December 2020."

Noem and Lewandowski, both married, have faced allegations of an extramarital affair, which they deny, despite being seen together in compromising situations at public events. Meanwhile, Noem has been actively involved in deportation raids, emphasizing a crackdown on illegal immigration under the Trump administration, which has seen a significant drop in border crossings.",
