      "feedback": "This draft would reach world-class quality with a structured, cross-source, first-principles regime map that unfolds over multiple years and ties causal chains to market pricing; right now it reads as a narrative synthesis but lacks explicit regimes, invariants, and falsifiable triggers. Actionable edits: (1) inject a compact, invariant anchor set at the top (real rate differentials, terms-of-trade/BoP, productivity growth and policy reaction functions) and state three regimes with clear transition conditions (e.g., Regime I: AI-enabled TFP uplift dominates; Regime II: policy ballast dominates (UBI vs targeted retraining) with a blunt income floor; Regime III: protectionist/reshoring impulse dominates via tariffs and demand re-pricing). Tie each regime to a causal chain: AI-driven productivity shifts capital allocation toward domestically investable sectors (semiconductors, data-center infrastructure); policy choices reprice risk premia and demand; tariffs reshape input costs and inflation, feeding into market caps, capex, and sector leadership.\n\n(2) formalize the transmission channels and quantify them with numbers drawn from sources: cite NL5YYTLF2 for 25% of US employment with high automation exposure (36 million jobs) and the Finland UBI trial’s muted employment effect; include Brookings’ implied scale of identity/personal wellbeing costs; incorporate SGB2PAZGK’s tariff-accelerated reshoring and AI/semiconductor investment rationale and the near-term inflation risk; add Ford-specific signals from 22PL3Q360 and W2622L6WW (Ford up ~17% in 2025; EV losses ~$1.3B; forward P/E ≈8; dividend yield ~5%; ROIC ~11–12% vs cost of capital) to anchor base-case vs growth-case outcomes. (3) convert the narrative into a base-case plus two alternative paths with explicit triggers: e.g., if tariff levels stay elevated and chip fabs receive scale, pivot toward Regime II/III dynamics; if AI-driven productivity surprises fail to materialize or if UBI pilots worsen incentives, reprice social-protection costs and demand. (4) sharpen the asset/pricing implications: identify which equities/sectors benefit (domestic semiconductor/AI infra, energy-intensive data-center builders) versus cyclicals (auto/commodities) under each regime, and present a short list of watchpoints with numeric thresholds (e.g., unemployment drift, CAPEX announcements, EV profitability milestones). (5) ensure every claim that relies on the articles cites the exact IDs (NL5YYTLF2, SGB2PAZGK, 22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW) and reconcile conflicts (Ford as income play versus growth potential; the dividend lure vs secular auto-cycle risk). (6) align to the SECTION FOCUS by explicitly articulating the base case, key risks, and the signals to monitor over the multi-year horizon, and prune extraneous content (e.g., lengthy theological quotes or non-core retirement content) that do not advance the structural macro frame. (7) deliver the rewritten piece as a tight, regime-map–driven analysis with a concise base-case paragraph, a two-regime alternative, and a short conclusion on confidence, avoiding generic platitudes and anchoring every point to the cited data.",
