      "feedback": "Your draft is a good start but still feels like a high‑level summary rather than a rigorous, scenario‑driven research note. Tighten the causal chain by explicitly linking each macro driver to a specific sector or security, and quantify the transmission (e.g., “a 1‑point rise in the U.S. CPI → 0.5‑point tightening in Fed policy → 0.3‑point decline in small‑cap equity risk premium”). Replace vague “persistent inflationary pressure” with concrete data (e.g., Japan’s wage growth rate, U.S. CPI trend, BOJ policy stance). For the UAS sector, move beyond the 97 % job growth figure to a projected revenue or earnings impact on related component makers (include a range, e.g., +5 % to +10 % EBIT for industrials). The small‑cap thesis needs a clear trigger: “IPO volume ≥ 95 deals and negative‑earning ratio < 30 % → 10‑15 % R2000 upside” – back this with recent R2000 IPO stats and the current negative‑earning ratio (cite the 2025 figure). For dividend stocks, quantify sustainability: “AbbVie’s payout ratio 110 % → 3‑year trailing FCF margin 25 % → 6 % total return” and compare to S&P 500. The Inghams paragraph should include margin compression numbers (e.g., 3‑year gross margin trend) and a sensitivity to customer concentration. Add a risk matrix: list each risk, its probability, and impact, and tie each to a specific catalyst (e.g., “rate hike cycle → 0.5‑point risk premium increase → 2‑3 % small‑cap drag”). Finally, ensure every claim is sourced: use IDs (FOM34PUWA, A7VLN74BK, Q7VVGNSQE, WISLWAJ15, GUJQZY4UO) and include inline citations. The revised note should read like a concise, data‑driven scenario map with clear timing windows, trigger thresholds, and watch‑list signals.",
