      "summary": "Recent surveys show that nearly half of Americans experience frequent stress, while sleep deprivation is rising, especially among younger women, and many feel the world is changing too quickly.  Storytelling—whether in everyday conversations or in hunter‑gatherer traditions—has been found to build relationships, create meaning, help people make sense of events, and inspire cooperative action, thereby reducing stress and improving well‑being.  A study of the Agta people in the Philippines demonstrates that skilled storytellers are preferred as social partners, promote higher levels of cooperation in their camps, and enjoy greater reproductive success, suggesting storytelling may have evolved as a mechanism for coordinating group behaviour.  These findings highlight storytelling’s potential as a tool for mitigating modern stressors and fostering resilience in rapidly changing societies.",
