      "text": "Thunderbolts* \u2014 Marvel\u2019s antihero adventure starring Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan and David Harbour \u2014 is opening in theaters Friday. What do critics have to say about the new film?\nThe official summary for Thunderbolts* reads, \u201cMarvel Studios assembles an unconventional team of antiheroes \u2014 Yelena Belova (Pugh), Bucky Barnes (Stan), Red Guardian (Harbour), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko) and John Walker (Wyatt Russell).\n\u201cAfter finding themselves ensnared in a death trap set by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfuss), these disillusioned castoffs must embark on a dangerous mission that will force them to confront the darkest corners of their pasts. Will this dysfunctional group tear themselves apart, or find redemption and unite as something much more before it\u2019s too late?\u201d\nRated PG-13, Thunderbolts* is directed by Jake Scheier (Netflix\u2019s Beef) and also stars Lewis Pullman, Geraldine Viswanathan, Chris Bauer and Wendell Pierce.\nThe review embargo for Thunderbolts* was lifted on Tuesday afternoon.\nThunderbolts* so far has earned an 88% \u201cfresh\u201d rating from Rotten Tomatoes critics based on 96 reviews. The RT Critics Consensus and Popcornmeter score is still pending.\nWhat Do Individual Critics Have To Say About \u2018Thunderbolts*\u2019?\nDavid Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter is among the top critics on RT who gives Thunderbolts* a fresh review, writing, \u201cThere\u2019s a disarming freshness to this first-time assembly, not to mention something even more unexpected: heart. That\u2019s due to an appealing ensemble cast but also to the new blood of a creative team with a distinctive take on the genre.\u201d\nNicolas Barber of the BBC also praises Thunderbolts* in his \u201cfresh\u201d review on RT, noting that Thunderbolts* is so much better than most of Marvel's post-Endgame films. It's not just because it's a rough-edged, big-hearted spy thriller about lovably clueless anti-heroes. It's because it has an actor as charismatic as [Florence] Pugh at its center.\u201d\nAlison Wilmore of New York Magazine/Vulture also praises Florence Pugh in her review on RT, writing, \u201cPugh, in particular, gives the movie an emotional tangibility that makes it feel realms more solid than the last few years of Marvel product.\nWilliam Bibbiani of The Wrap in one regard knocks Thunderbolts* but still gives the film a \u201cfresh\u201d review on RT, noting, \u201cAlthough it\u2019s hard to shake the sense that on a practical level this studio is just scraping the bottom of the barrel, desperately hoping their minor characters can be converted into headliners, they\u2019ve done a damn good job of it.\u201d\nIn his \u201cfresh\u201d review on RT, Peter Debruge of Variety compares the team members in Thunderbolts* to another famous band of MCU misfits, noting, \u201cAs with the Guardians of the Galaxy films, what works here is the uneasy tension within a team that comes together out of necessity, rather than any natural sense of affinity.\u201d\nRobbie Collin of the U.K.\u2019s Daily Telegraph is the sole top critic on RT who gives Thunderbolts* a \u201crotten\u201d review to date, writing, \u201cDespite its notionally spiky tone, moroseness is the film\u2019s root chord.\u201d\nThunderbolts* plays in Thursday previews before opening in theaters nationwide on Friday."

      "text": "Stans \u2014 a music documentary about iconic rapper Eminem and how his songs have resonated with his enormous fan base \u2014 is coming to streaming this week.\nStans opened in theaters in limited release on Aug. 7. The title of the feature-length documentary was inspired by the name of Eminem\u2019s legendary song released 25 years ago.\n\u201cReleased in 2000, Eminem\u2019s song \u2018Stan,\u2019 about an obsessive, unstable fan, remains iconic \u2014 so iconic that the term stan was officially added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2017,\" reads the official summary of Stans from Paramount+. \"The song and its storyline serve as a guiding light for this unconventional and fully authorized feature, which follows a cast of real-life stans whose deep personal connections to Eminem mirror some of the many themes found throughout his lyrics.\n\u201cMore than just an exploration of fandom, Stans examines the complicated relationship between one of the world\u2019s most private artists and his massive public persona. Through stylized recreations, rare archival footage and intimate original interviews, it offers a raw, loud and revealing journey across Eminem\u2019s career and the passionate audience that has grown with him.\u201d\nStans will make its streaming premiere on Tuesday, Aug. 27, on Paramount+.\nThe streaming platform has two tiers. Paramount+ Essential is an ad-based tier that costs $7.99 per month, while Paramount+ Premium is an ad-free tier and costs $12.99 per month. Both tiers offer a free seven-day trial.\nDirector Says One Line In \u2018Stan\u2019 Song Echoes Through \u2018Stans\u2019 Movie\nIn addition to being featured in Stans, Eminem \u2014 whose real name is Marshall Mathers III \u2014 produces the documentary. Stans is directed by Emmy Award-winning writer, director and investigative journalist Steven Leckart.\n\u201c'Stan' is one of the most unconventional songs ever written, where the story is mostly told from a fan's perspective, so this film was an incredible opportunity to find a unique approach,\u201d Leckart said in the Paramount+ press release announcing the streaming date of Stans.\n\u201cWe kept coming back to one lyric from the song: 'I\u2019m just like you.\u2019 Fans who echo that same sentiment carry much of the film,\" Leckhart added. \"But like the song, Marshall's perspective was also essential to the movie. I'm grateful for just how candid, sincere and frequently hilarious he was.\"\nStans was a huge hit with Rotten Tomatoes critics, who gave the film a 93% \u201cfresh\u201d review based on 14 reviews. Stans also received a 94% \u201cfresh\u201d score on RT\u2019s Popcornmeter based on 100-plus verified user ratings.\nStans debuts on streaming on Paramount+ on Tuesday."

      "text": "Florence Pugh might have daredevil in her DNA.\nAt last summer\u2019s San Diego Comic-Con, Pugh revealed that she had a major stunt in \u201cThunderbolts\u201d: jumping off the second tallest building in the world, Merdeka, a 118-story skyscraper in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It\u2019s the type of terrifying feat that would freak most grandparents out, but Pugh\u2019s grandmother, affectionately called \u201cGranzo Pat,\u201d didn\u2019t seem to bat an eyelash during the London premiere of the Marvel movie.\n\u201cShe loved the movie. She said, \u2018Brilliant, darling. Very thrilling,\u2019 but I didn\u2019t ask her what she thought of the jump,\u201d Pugh tells Variety in Los Angeles a few days later. \u201cShe\u2019s also crazy, like she\u2019s someone that does some pretty mad stuff, so maybe she just thought that was a walk in the park.\u201d\nPopular on Variety\nWith the once-in-a-lifetime stunt, Pugh adds \u201cGuinness World Record holder\u201d to her already impressive resume, but she didn\u2019t do it for the personal glory. \u201cI wanted to do that stunt because I knew that it meant that we all got to do it. Like, yes, I got to jump off the second-tallest building in the world, but so did we all,\u201d Pugh says of sharing the record with longtime Marvel stunt coordinator Heidi Moneymaker and base jumper Katie Hansen. \u201cThat day in Malaysia was an achievement for all of us. We all got to say that we worked on that stunt, and what an impressive and powerful way to start a movie!\u201d\nIndeed, the freefall underscores the idea that \u201cThunderbolts*,\u201d in theaters now, is a totally different kind of Marvel movie \u2014 one that uses its action to alert the audience that Pugh\u2019s kick-ass mercenary Yelena Belova is not really enjoying her job. That\u2019s the early vibe of director Jake Schreier\u2019s superhero team-up movie, which assembles a crew of antiheroes \u2014 Black Widow agent Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh); Bucky Barnes, a.k.a. the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan); Russian super soldier \u2014 and Yelena\u2019s adopted dad \u2014 Red Guardian (David Harbour); the disgraced former \u201cCaptain America\u201d John Walker (Wyatt Russell); the invisible spy Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen); and combat expert Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko) \u2014 to face their darkest sides of themselves.\nThat beginning makes quite a powerful statement, because this movie is about depression and grappling with shame \u2014 things you wouldn\u2019t have expected from a summer blockbuster. What was it like to delve into those themes?\nReally, I was just so impressed that Marvel wanted to do this version of the movie. They\u2019ve made some amazing films with amazing stunt sequences, but how cool to be able to say that we\u2019ve made a movie that is about something that we all struggle with.\nThis movie will help a lot of people. And the underlying message is that we need to be there for each other. We need to open up. We need to connect. Like that, to me is that would be an impressive movie anyway, let alone it being a Marvel movie that thousands of people are gonna go and watch.\nYou\u2019ve described Yelena as a very raw character, but she\u2019s also very empathetic and very lonely. What was it like getting a chance to take her on this journey where she\u2019s finally finding her team, that family that she\u2019s looking for?\nOne of the things that I love about her is that she\u2019s always trying to help the person that maybe isn\u2019t as strong, or maybe needs a bit of love. She did that with Kate Bishop [in \u201cHawkeye\u201d]; she did that with Bob. She saved the hamster \u2014 she adopted Fanny Longbottom. Like she\u2019s someone that really understands what it feels like to need help.\nBecause she was left when she was younger and because she had that open-wounded relationship with her sister, it meant that she\u2019s very sympathetic to people, and even though she\u2019s going through her own trauma in this movie, like that\u2019s still there. She still wants to save the hamster, and she still wants to help Bob, and that\u2019s a really beautiful thing to play. So yes, she is raw, but she is also very loving. And even when she is feeling low, she is loving. And I love that about her.\nIt\u2019s beautiful to watch her realize that suppressing her pain is not the right answer. Then, you and David have a heart-tugging scene where Yelena breaks down over all her regrets. What did you make of that when you read it on the page? What did you want to explore with that father-daughter relationship?\nIt wasn\u2019t there on the page \u2014 there was a version of it, and it was fine, but it didn\u2019t allow us to shout about the important things.\nIn the original script, there wasn\u2019t anything to do with Natasha; it was all about them just finding each other annoying and that was just something that David and I were so adamant about. Like, we can\u2019t not have these characters discuss the elephant in the room. We can\u2019t have these two people be pretending as if the last however many years, didn\u2019t happen. They have to shout at each other. That\u2019s what they\u2019re angry about. They haven\u2019t communicated with each other; they haven\u2019t been in each other\u2019s lives.\nAnd grief sometimes does that. Grief is a painful, embarrassing and horrible hole that you get stuck in. They are both flawed, and they need a moment to just like, fucking shout at each other and tell each other they love each other. So, we were very passionate about that \u2014 and Jake was so excited that we were \u2014 and we just went through versions of what we wanted to say to each other.\nThen on that day, when we got to do it, I love working with David. He\u2019s so big and he\u2019s so loud and emotional \u2013 both of those characters are such impressive personalities \u2014 that it was really, really cool to be able to have a fight. Basically, they just need to have a cuddle.\nExactly, that would solve it. I was thinking back to Comic Con, when you and I found out \u2014 and freaked out \u2014 over the fact that Robert Downey Jr. was going to be in \u201cAvengers: Doomsday.\u201d Now, there\u2019s even more people.\nLoads of people.\nWho else did you freak out over finding out they were going to be in it, too? I screamed when I saw Sir Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellan were announced.\n100%! Oh, god, there\u2019s too many people in it [to choose]! Pedro Pascal, obviously, always and forever. Paul Rudd, yes, so funny. Genuinely, the idea that all of those people are going to be in the same movie is nutso sauce.\nAs you move on to make that film, Yelena will now be in that \u201cfront-facing role\u201d that she asked for. What are you looking forward to most about getting a chance to explore a new side of her?\nI hope that she\u2019s happy now. I hope that she feels fulfilled, like she has purpose. And I hope that we get to see some of her light and her charm and her color again, because I loved playing that before."

The logline for the second season reads, \u201cIn Season 2, Peacemaker (Cena) discovers an alternate world where life is everything he wishes it could be.

      "text": "With the new Marvel movie Thunderbolts*, Hannah John-Kamen is getting a rare opportunity for any actor in any type of movie.\nStarting out as the main villain, Ava Starr/Ghost, in 2018\u2019s Marvel Cinematic Universe hit Ant-Man and the Wasp, John-Kamen\u2019s character has turned away from being an out-and-out villiain into an antihero in Thunderbolts*.\nAs such, Ghost is part of a group of bad guys taking on the worse guys, where she, Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh), Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Red Guardian (David Harbour) and John Walker (Wyatt Russell) have the propensity to do good things despite their checkered pasts.\nWhile Thunderbolts* has all the action, intensity and suspense that fans of the MCU have come to know and love since Iron Man kicked off the sprawling movie series in 2008, it fully embraces an antihero ideology, which to date has largely been about superheroes.\nBut being a hero who does good things isn\u2019t fully out of the depth of the members of the group in Thunderbolts*.\n\u201cWhat this movie does is it forces us not to just to be a team, but gives the ability look at ourselves and ask for forgiveness so we can actually dream bigger than what we thought we could \u2026 that the idea of being a hero isn't so ridiculous,\u201d John-Kamen said in a Zoom conversation Friday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trained into a routine to think that we don't deserve it otherwise. I think this movie gives us so more depth for our characters and so much more of a journey to go on.\u201d\nHannah John-Kamen Loved The Opportunity To Play A New And Improved Ava/Ghost\nOpening in theaters worldwide on Friday, Thunderbolts* is set not long after the events of the previous MCU chapter Captain America: Brave New World. At the beginning of the film, Yelena is sent by CIA Director Valentina Allegra de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) to eliminate a target at a secret O.X.E. facility where superhuman experiments are being conducted.\nWhen Yelena arrives at the facility, she encounters Ghost, John Walker and Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), who have also been sent to the facility with similar orders from Valentina to essentially eliminate one another. To survive politically, Valentina needs to wash her hands of any illegal covert government activities. If her dirty secrets are exposed, Valentina faces orders of impeachment from U.S. Congress.\nHowever, when the group of would-be assassins survives Valentina\u2019s attempt at their across-the-board elimination, they make like the old Avengers and assemble a team \u2014 along with Bucky and the Red Guardian \u2014 to apprehend the CIA director and thwart her plans to introduce a new and very dangerous superhuman to the world dubbed \u201cThe Sentry.\u201d\nSince Ava/Ghost\u2019s story in Thunderbolts* is dictated by Eric Pearson and Joanna Calo\u2019s script \u2014 as well as filmmaker Jake Schreier\u2019s direction \u2014 Hannah John-Kamen said she didn\u2019t necessarily try to enhance who Ava/Ghost was in 2018\u2019s Ant-Man and the Wasp.\nEffectively, Thunderbolts* signals a new day for Ava/Ghost, which means she was happy to leave who her character was in Ant-Man and the Wasp in the rear-view mirror.\n\u201cJake and I really discussed this because it\u2019s a different Ava. I've really wanted to leave the other Ava behind in a way because in [Ant-Man and the Wasp], I played a girl who was completely riddled with pain and death,\u201d John-Kamen explained. \u201cThat was the driving force behind her bad decision-making. Her uncontrollable, naive and immature ways of trying to deal with her survival was to kill other people, so she lost her way and lost her control completely.\u201d\nNow, John-Kamen said, Ava/Ghost \u2014 who has an unstable molecular composition that allows her to move through objects like a specter \u2014 \u201chas matured and is all grown up and in control of her powers.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s got a very hard exterior \u2026 and she doesn\u2019t depend on anyone,\" John-Kamen said. \"She doesn't need anyone, and she\u2019s in a different rhythm completely, not the rhythm in the original movie.\u201d\nAnother big change for Ava/Ghost is a whole new outfit, which has is jet black and has a commando feel \u2014 the polar opposite of her white, ghostlike attire in Ant-Man and the Wasp.\n\"The new costume is insanely detailed and beautiful,\u201d John-Kamen enthused. \u201cIt\u2019s really a big part of your day in Marvel Universe when we\u2019re filming because when we block the scenes, we\u2019re all in our undergarments and leggings with Ugg boots on set. As soon as we all get suited up \u2014 which is a good 25-minute process \u2014 and we return to set, it feels like we have different powers. Your posture changes. Everything you do feels elevated.\u201d\nOn top of that, John-Kamen\u2019s costumes in Ant-Man and the Wasp and Thunderbolts* define who Ava/Ghost is in dramatically different ways.\n\u201cThe original Ghost costume was interesting because it was so badass before, but it was also functional,\u201d John-Kamen explained. \u201cThe idea was that Ava and Bill Foster (Laurence Fishburne) had created this costume for her to not flicker away to death. It was more of a practical thing because it was a chamber that she was in.\n\u201cIn Thunderbolts*, Ava is in a costume that was made for Ghost\u2019s abilities,\u201d John-Kamen added. \u201cIt\u2019s elevated and has a different power and energy and a different control. It\u2019s scarier and it's more warrior.\u201d\nRated PG-13, Thunderbolts* also stars Lewis Pullman, Geraldine Viswanathan, Chris Bauer and Wendell Pierce. Thunderbolts* opens in theaters worldwide on Friday.\nNote: Some quotes in this interview feature for \u201cThunderbolts*\u201d were condensed and edited for clarity."

      "text": "James Gunn\u2019s Superman, starring David Corenswet as the Man of Steel, is ready to pass another box office milestone this weekend.\nSuperman \u2014 the first film released under Gunn and Peter Safran\u2019s reign as co-CEOs at Warner Bros.\u2019 DC Studios division \u2014 opened in theaters on July 11, earning $125 million in its first weekend domestically.\nThe film held the domestic box office crown in its second weekend with a $58.3 million take, but was knocked down to No. 2 in its third weekend by Disney and Marvel Studios\u2019 The Fantastic Four: First Steps, which earned $117.6 million in its opening frame in North American theaters. Since then, Superman\u2019s box office run has held steady while The Fantastic Four has taken a nose dive.\nHeading into its seventh weekend of release, Superman was expected easily top the $600 million mark worldwide once Friday\u2019s box office numbers rolled in and it did. Through Thursday, Superman had a tally of $343.5 million in North American ticket sales and $256 million at the international box office for a running worldwide tally of $599.5 million.\nOn Friday, Superman earned $955,000 domestically and $400,000 internationally to boost the film\u2019s worldwide tally to $600.9 million.\nDespite reaching the $600 million benchmark, only time will tell if Superman will become profitable during its theatrical run. According to Variety, Superman had a production budget of $225 million and a worldwide marketing spend of $125 million.\nIf the standard rule applies where theaters keep 50% of the ticket sales, that means Superman \u2014 not counting any residuals or miscellaneous payouts \u2014 still has some financial ground to cover. However, in additon to its ticket sales, Superman just opened another revenue stream on Aug. 15 when the film debuted on digital streaming via premium video on demand.\nThe release of the film on PVOD compliments the release of Gunn\u2019s Peacemaker Season 2, which debuted with Episode 1 on HBO Max on Thursday. Set after the events of Superman, Peacemaker\u2019s new season includes characters from Superman as the John Cena-led series continues to build out Gunn and Safran\u2019s new DC Universe.\nAnother Warner Bros. Release Just Reached A Box Office Milestone\nThere\u2019s no question that it\u2019s been a great year at the box office for Warner Bros., which prior to the release of Superman, scored huge hits with A Minecraft Movie, Sinners, Final Destination Bloodlines and now, Weapons (F1: The Movie could be counted among Warner Bros.\u2019 wins, too, but the studio is only on board as distributor of the movie, which is an Apple Original Films production).\nOn Thursday, the Julia Garner and Josh Brolin horror thriller made $2.4 million in North American ticket sales, boosting its domestic tally to $100.2 million.\nVariety said passing the $100 million domestic box office milestone is a win for Warner Bros., considering that the Weapons had a $38 million production budget before prints and advertising.\nCoupled with the film\u2019s international take of $72.3 million, Weapons to date has a worldwide tally of $172.5 million.\nWeapons \u2014 which took the domestic box office crown in its opening weekend and nabbed it again in its second weekend frame \u2014 is facing tough competition in its third weekend when the sing-along version of the Netflix streaming sensation KPop Demon Hunters hits theaters for a special weekend release.\nKPop Demon Hunters is projected by Deadline to earn $15 million-plus domestically this weekend, so Weapons will need to top that tally to keep its box office crown. As of Friday, Deadline is projecting that Weapons will earn $13.5 million in its third weekend frame.\nThis weekend also sees the release of some notable indie titles, including Ron Howard\u2019s survival thriller Eden, Ethan Coen\u2019s crime comedy Honey Don\u2019t and the English language dub of the worldwide box office blockbuster Ne Zha 2."
