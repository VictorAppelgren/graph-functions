They\u2019re also imposing a significant drag on economic growth.\" Krugman added that there has been one saving grace to Trump's economy: investments in artificial intelligence. Several AI companies from NVIDIA to Apple and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company have made centi-billion-dollar investments in the U.S. during Trump's second term, according to from the . However, Krugman warned that any slowdown to the AI space could spell trouble for the U.S. economy. \"Today, it\u2019s likely that the United States would be heading into a recession under the weight of higher prices and slower growth if the economy weren\u2019t being supported by a huge boom in AI-related investment,\" Krugman added. \"And this danger remains: if the AI boom goes bust, the odds are high that the US economy will be plunged into a recession.\"",

      "text": "In last week\u2019s primer I wrote about what stagflation is, the logic behind it, and its history. Here\u2019s a brief list of what I covered:\n\u00b7 Stagflation is a combination of inflation and high unemployment\n\u00b7 What it means for inflation to become entrenched in the economy: companies and workers raise their prices because they expect everyone else to do the same.\n\u00b7 Taming the inflation of the 1970s required extreme measures by the Federal Reserve, resulting in a severe period of stagflation in the US during 1979-1984, because inflation had become entrenched in the economy\n\u00b7 In contrast, taming the post-Covid inflation of 2022 to 2024 did not require the same harsh medicine because inflation had not become entrenched in the economy. As a result, the Federal Reserve was able to bring inflation down without inflicting high unemployment on the economy.\nToday I\u2019ll look forward. Stagflation is very much on people\u2019s minds again, for good reason. The Trump administration\u2019s tariff and deportation policies are creating a significant inflationary shock. They\u2019re also imposing a significant drag on economic growth. Today, it\u2019s likely that the United States would be heading into a recession under the weight of higher prices and slower growth if the economy weren\u2019t being supported by a huge boom in AI-related investment. And this danger remains: if the AI boom goes bust, the odds are high that the US economy will be plunged into a recession.\nIn talking about stagflation, it\u2019s important to acknowledge that its effects can range from run-of-the mill bad to devastating. For example, in the early 1990s, there was a burst of inflation and an extended period of elevated unemployment. It was bad \u2014 but not that bad. That is, there was a mild recession, not a deep and devastating one. But there are also episodes like 1979\u20131984 (which I covered at length in last week\u2019s primer). In that episode, it took a severe and lengthy recession \u2014 many years of high unemployment \u2014 for the Federal Reserve to bring inflation under control. Last, as we experienced in the post-Covid period, there can be times when stagflation can be avoided altogether.\nWhat accounts for the difference? That is, what determines if a period of inflation will result in a devastating recession rather than a merely mild recession, or perhaps no recession at all? The answer, as I wrote in last week\u2019s primer, is due to whether inflation or not has become entrenched in the economy. When it has, the Federal Reserve has to send the economy into a severe recession by raising interest rates substantially to purge the price spiral from of the economy. If inflation hasn\u2019t become entrenched, the Federal Reserve can tame inflation without needing to cause high unemployment.\nWhich scenario will it be this time? I don\u2019t know. The Federal Reserve doesn\u2019t know. Trump administration officials definitely don\u2019t know. But we can talk about the factors affecting how it goes \u2014 and what policies might make it better or worse.\nBeyond the paywall I\u2019ll discuss the following:\n1. The Trump shock and how it\u2019s playing out\n2. How will we know if inflation is becoming entrenched?\nI\u2019ll reserve discussion of policy \u2014 and the crucial role of the Fed\u2019s credibility \u2014 for yet another stagflation primer, next week.\nKeep reading with a 7-day free trial\nSubscribe to Paul Krugman to keep reading this post and get 7 days of free access to the full post archives."

      "text": "During his four years as president, Joe Biden worried that if Donald Trump ever returned to the White House, it would pose a major threat to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Trump, during his first term, toyed with the idea of withdrawing the U.S. from NATO \u2014 whereas Biden, as president, aggressively championed NATO's expansion when Sweden and Finland opted to join the alliance.\nSeven months into Trump's second presidency, the U.S. is still a NATO member. But author/military historian Phillips O'Brien, during an interview with economist Paul Krugman, stressed that Trump's return to the White House marks a dramatic change in U.S./Europe relations.\nKrugman, on August 23, posted video of the interview on his SubStack page and also published it as a Q&A article. And O'Brien voiced major concerns about the United States' relationship with Europe.\n\"The United States is going to great lengths to antagonize its allies,\" O'Brien told Krugman. \"I don't get it. None of this makes any sense to me.\"\nThe author/historian said of the Ukraine/Russia War, \"I think what happens to Ukraine will determine how Europe deals with this. If Ukraine is sacrificed, I think Europe is going to have a terrible future. Because it's going to be dependent on the U.S., which has basically sacrificed Ukraine to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's Russia. Europe might even break apart, structurally, such that you'll have the Central Eastern Europeans, the ones who want to stand by Ukraine, the Finns, the Baltics, the Nordics going one way and then the Western Europeans sort of pretending things are OK.\"\nO'Brien added, \"So, I think people are underrating the chance of Europe splitting over Ukraine, which is why it's so important, I think, that Ukraine comes out of the war in good shape.\"\nAccording to O'Brien, U.S. allies in Europe will be paying very close attention to the outcome of the United States' 2026 midterms.\n\"Well, that's the key thing, isn't it? The 2026 midterms,\" O'Brien told Krugman. \"I don't think people are paying enough attention, because they have to be run fairly. I do think the Democrats have a very good chance of winning them if they are run fairly and happen under normal conditions. But they could also be easily perverted\u2026. I would say that 2026 elections will show not whether America can come back, but whether it has a chance to come back \u2014 or whether the period we're going into could be a lot longer and darker than we imagined.\"\nPaul Krugman's full interview with Phillips O'Brien is available on his SubStack page as a video and a Q&A article."

      "text": "'Washington is becoming Chinatown': Wall Street Journal bashes Trump's 'statism' move\nThe Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial board bashed President Donald Trump's latest business move, arguing that it models China's \"statism.\"\nOn Friday, Trump announced that the U.S. government is taking a 10% stake in computer chip-maker Intel. The government is paying the company $8.7 billion in all, with the funds coming from an approved but not yet paid grant under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and the Secure Enclave program, according to a statement from the company.\nThe Wall Street Journal's editorial board slammed the deal in a new op-ed, arguing that the deal will stifle innovation at the struggling company\n\"In the name of competing with China, the U.S. is imitating its model of state-run business,\" the editorial reads in part. \"Washington is becoming Chinatown.\"\n\"Mr. Trump accused Kamala Harris of being a socialist, but the Biden Administration never nationalized companies,\" the editorial continues.\nThe Journal's editors also found it curious that Trump's policies have not yet received significant pushback from Republicans in Congress.\nWhy aren\u2019t Republicans pushing back on Mr. Trump\u2019s Intel deal?\" the editors asked. \"They might consider how the next Democratic President could use the government\u2019s stake to press the left\u2019s political imperatives\u2014Intel profits to build low-income housing? Statism is gaining currency on the political left and right, resulting in a bizarre fusion of ideas.\""

      "text": "Trump's glittering monstrosity could be his doom\nThe Washington Post recently published an article in which it noted that any chance President Donald Trump has to complete his $200 million \"golden ballroom\" at the White House in the near term would necessarily require wholly dodging years-long federal rules and regulations that would otherwise oversee such a project.\nDemocrats should silently cheer such frenetic desecration in homage to the purely pragmatic, a means to best bring about the last good chance to normalize the republic. Build it, and we will all come \u2014 history has a ready precedent.\nAn inclination to green-light this monstrosity may run counter to every preconceived notion of responsible stewardship, but Americans who are looking to end the encampment of a man who already breezily talks about 2028 should hope that he rams the plans through as thoroughly and recklessly as he did the gift of a new personalized 747 jet.\nOther than perhaps the Epstein files, the inchoate ballroom may represent the biggest threat to the Trump administration, a standing monument to opulence in trying times, and an undeniable middle finger to America's struggling working class \u2014 a massive percentage of Trump's base.\nIf one begins by noting that Trump has never committed to peacefully leaving office, it is incumbent to start considering scenarios by which Trump might leave, short of a battle. Any efficient and effective solution necessarily involves cratering support among what was formerly his strongest political hold \u2014 MAGA men.\nWe have yet to see a Trump scandal shake MAGA man's confidence and loyalty to Trump, and it is wrong to presume that a sufficiently large scandal exists, even one involving Jeffrey Epstein. Picture it now: \"It's all made-up evidence, a hoax!\" No, the only sure means by which MAGA will turn on Trump is irrefutable evidence that he first turned on them.\nEnter two converging realities.\nOne, that ballroom looks like it is going to get built. Trump doesn't usually just float development ideas. They have obliterated the Rose Garden, put up a tennis complex, and gilded the Oval Office. Trump is already making the place his personal palace (A scary enough premise).\nTwo, perhaps you've noticed, inflation hasn't gone away \u2014 indeed, it seems to be increasing, especially grocery prices. This is particularly bad news for Trump since he made grocery prices one of his signature campaign promises, and, of course, we all eat, rich and poor alike.\nThere is a reason every presidential campaign focuses on \"kitchen table issues.\" The economy drives the mind of the body politic. The typical MAGA man has learned to endure nearly every type of Trump scandal, but he has never had to defend Trump on such weak ground, a shrinking economy.\nIndeed, one of the few political threats to Trump can only come to fruition when and if he becomes a real threat to MAGA man's stability, his economic well-being. Simply triggering the libs has largely run its course anyway. No, they want him working for them; he's \"their\" president, they say.\nPresidents can and do survive hard economic times, but only when the voters believe that the president understands that things are bad and is working to fix them. We know that Trump appreciates at least that reality: he fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer after one particularly concerning jobs report, a decision he may soon very much regret. Dismissing the messenger and denying the problem exists belies someone more invested in creating his own reality than fixing ours.\nAmericans not only understand reality but are forced to create it, never more so than when grappling with sending kids to school, debating whether to buy a home, or planning a retirement. Most Americans have never been to a ballroom, don't care if they ever do, much less relate to ever wanting one, never mind build it. On those two or three occasions in a life when we might need a ballroom, we rent and decorate halls.\nVery little says \"out of touch\" quite like prioritizing a project that inherently looks like personal ownership of the White House, extravagant luxury, devastatingly out of touch, and \u2014 most damaging \u2014 now out of MAGA man's reach.\nTrump looks to be building a Versailles-like ballroom at the worst possible time from his perspective, as if history has nothing to teach at all on the subject. Indeed, for once, we should be grateful that Trump remains wholly ignorant of past lessons because his decision to build entails such poor timing, such self-indulgent priorities, such reckless disregard for those he considers his people, that all in opposition should [silently] hope that he breaks sacred ground and that audacious and ostentatious plans are released with blissfully ignorant enthusiasm.\nTo the extent there is an argument that such desecration of a national treasure must be avoided at all costs, it should only be made while noting that there's no evidence that Trump believes the law dictates when he leaves.\nIf there is another side, another hope for American democracy, it involves cratering support from the people who make Trump possible. To that end, the plans for the ballroom may be more dangerous to Trump than anything found in the Epstein files \u2014 defending that type of scandal comes second nature to MAGA voters now anyway.\nThese same voters have never been asked to defend Trump through a major economic downturn, and nothing, nothing, says \"I don't care\" quite like the plans for a ballroom juxtaposed against such worry. We can debate whether Trump really ever cared about his voters, but that misses the point. A ballroom in such times means he now resents them.\nThe last people who built a Versailles-like ballroom made a similar miscalculation. The faster and more outrageously this thing is built, the less economic pain it will take to bring about a political matter/anti-matter end, the ultimate bonfire of the vanities.\nBuild it, and even they will come.\n- Jason Miciak is an American attorney, former associate editor for Occupy Democrats, and current part-time columnist for Politizoom"

      "text": "Billionaire Mark Cuban on Sunday released what he deems an explanation for why \"inflation isn't up.\"\nCuban, who has clashed with Trump as the world leader embraced the richest man in the world and Cuban's rival, Elon Musk, earlier this year released a political analysis on the \"thing to understand about Donald Trump.\"\nNow, Cuban is putting his CEO hat on to explain inflation.\nEXCLUSIVE: Trump accused of new grift that puts Qatari plane in shade\nTaking to X, Cuban wrote, \"Let\u2019s talk about why inflation isn\u2019t up, as economists predicted.\"\nHe continued:\n\"It\u2019s really simple. I see it in all my product based companies... They borrow money or use their available cash to front run the tariffs and buy as much inventory as they can,\" he said, noting that time period is \"3, 6 months or longer.\" \"In many cases they get a better price because the [manufacturer] knows the risks post tariffs.\"\nSecondly, according to Cuban, \"That cash is expensive.\"\n\"They either lose the ability to earn interest, (4pct) the ability to invest in other parts of their biz or they pay interest on a loan (10 to 20 pct).\"\nOn those points, Cuban added, \"None of the above is a positive.\"\nHe wrote, \"Not having cash or add to their liabilities is a risk,\" and, \"They see the on and off again tariffs in action, so they don\u2019t know how long their inventory will have the value they expected.\"\n\"So they don\u2019t raise prices. In fact they may even discount some as a way to clear out inventory and replenish cash or pay down expensive loans... This isn't just small companies. This is all companies facing this. This is why Walmart says they will be raising prices in the future,\" the billionaire said on Sunday. \"The variance in tariffs has made it impossible to know how to manage costs, so you do all you can to clear out inventory and get back to cash. And take your chances on tariffs not being as big as you feared... This is why prices haven\u2019t gone up to this point.\""
