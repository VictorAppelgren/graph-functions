  "content": "Italy\u2019s approach\u2014labor-intensive and openly humanitarian\u2014has created a pathway for hundreds of Gazan children and families.\n\nOn August 12\u201313, three Italian Air Force C-130 aircraft landed in Rome, Milan, and Pisa with 31 children and more than 90 accompanying relatives on board. According to the Italian Foreign Affairs Ministry, this was the country\u2019s largest medical evacuation of Palestinian minors to date, bringing Italy\u2019s totals since 2024 to 181 children and 396 companions, with 917 Gazans admitted overall when family reunifications are included.\n\n\u201cThis was not just an airlift but a demonstration of our commitment,\u201d the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs told The Media Line. \u201cItaly has consistently opened its hospitals, even when larger European economies have taken far fewer patients. France, for example, has received only a dozen children, while Italy has already treated more than 180,\u201d they added.\n\nThe operation was coordinated by the Office of the Prime Minister together with the Foreign and Defense Ministries, Civil Protection, and in collaboration with the World Health Organization, Food and Agriculture Organization, UN World Food Program, and the Red Cross.\n\nFor Dr. Simone Pancani, pediatric surgeon at Florence\u2019s Meyer Children\u2019s Hospital and coordinator of its humanitarian task force, the latest mission reflected both urgency and fragility.\n\n\u201cAmong those evacuated was a 12-year-old girl with severe fractures from a mine explosion, traveling only with her brother, and a 4-year-old boy with an autoimmune blood disease,\u201d Pancani said to The Media Line. \u201cThe medical reports we receive are incomplete, sometimes outdated. Often, we meet the patient for the first time when the ambulance arrives under the aircraft,\u201d he added.\n\nHe described dehydration and lack of access to clean water as compounding factors.\n\n\u201cSome of the children showed frank signs of malnutrition and dehydration. In Eilat, where we boarded them onto the aircraft, the temperature was 47 degrees in the middle of a sandstorm. They are transported from Gaza across 200 kilometers of desert in Israeli ambulances, often with minimal water along the way,\u201d Pancani explained.\n\nOne case highlighted the risks: A young woman, later identified as Marah Abu Zuhri, died at Pisa\u2019s hospital less than 48 hours after arrival. She had been suffering from complex pathologies, suspected leukemia, and severe malnutrition.\n\nOnce in Italy, the challenges continue.\n\n\u201cEven once healed, these patients cannot return to Gaza. They are in a state of stalemate. Families with multiple children now live in Italian towns, where we must arrange accommodation, schools, medical assistance, and cultural mediation,\u201d Pancani added.\n\n\u201cWe still have Ukrainian patients who arrived in 2022, after the war in Ukraine began. If new groups continue to arrive from Gaza, there is a real risk of overloading our hospitals and social structures,\u201d he noted.\n\n\u201cWe are dealing with psychophysical trauma. Children often say little, but companions\u2014mothers, sisters, aunts\u2014speak about loss and fear. Rebuilding childhood will take time. Cultural mediators are fundamental; without them, it would be impossible to communicate, reassure, or gain consent for treatment,\u201d he noted.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained Italy\u2019s motivation during the interview.\n\n\u201cWe have hospital beds and evacuation flights. The Food for Gaza initiative is managed together with FAO, the World Food Programme, and the Red Cross to ensure it is not presented as a bilateral initiative but as part of a wider multilateral humanitarian program,\u201d they stated.\n\nThey also noted that Italy has taken in far more patients than other EU countries.\n\n\u201cNo other EU state has undertaken this level of effort. France, for instance, has evacuated only a small number of patients. Italy has clearly assumed the greater humanitarian role,\u201d they pointed out.\n\nThey linked this to a broader crisis in Gaza: \u201cWe are facing a humanitarian emergency in which access to medical care is one of the most urgent needs. Malnutrition, chronic illnesses, and war-related injuries combine into a catastrophic situation. Italy\u2019s decision has been to prioritize humanitarian principles over political hesitation,\u201d they said.\n\nOn European divisions, they acknowledged limitations. \u201cThere is no common European position on sanctioning Israel or on creating binding measures to end the conflict, unlike in other crises such as piracy in the Red Sea or sanctions on Russia. Italy supports humanitarian measures, but at the European level, there remains a lack of consensus on political action,\u201d they added.\n\nThey also explained Italy\u2019s caution on Palestinian state recognition. \u201cItaly\u2019s view is that recognition should be tied to clearly defined borders and stable governing authority. At present, there is fragmentation: the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority, Gaza under Hamas, which is listed as a terrorist organization in Europe. Without unity, recognition would not resolve the problem,\u201d they noted.\n\nStill, they pointed to positive precedents: \u201cThere have been successful cases of common European security policy, from the fight against piracy off Somalia to coordination in the Red Sea. These show that a unified EU approach is possible, though not yet achieved in this conflict,\u201d they said.\n\nIn stark contrast, the United States has suspended all visitor visas for Gazans, including those requiring urgent medical care. The State Department cited unspecified security concerns but has not released evidence.\n\nThe decision followed pressure from Republican lawmakers and public lobbying by activist Laura Loomer, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed congressional offices had raised the issue.\n\nJoe Truzman, senior research analyst and editor at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019 Long War Journal, said the lack of transparency leaves room for doubt.\n\n\u201cHelping those in need of medical treatment is a just cause, but the government also has a responsibility to ensure there is no security threat to American citizens. Until the State Department explains its rationale, the reasoning behind this decision remains unclear and open to interpretations not based on hard evidence,\u201d he said to The Media Line.\n\nHe elaborated on what is known: \u201cAccording to the US government, some organizations granted visas were allegedly linked to terrorist groups in Gaza. Without public evidence, it is impossible to assess whether the suspension is justified,\u201d he added.\n\nTruzman underlined the international implications: \u201cIf convincing evidence is produced, it could influence other countries to tighten their vetting. If no proof is presented, it may have the opposite effect, encouraging Europe to expand humanitarian admissions,\u201d he stated.\n\nHe also highlighted the legal dimension: \u201cPalestinian rights groups have previously challenged the US government in court. This decision may become another such case, potentially argued not only domestically but in international forums,\u201d he said.\n\nItaly\u2019s approach\u2014labor-intensive and openly humanitarian\u2014has created a pathway for hundreds of Gazan children and families. It comes with challenges, from incomplete records and long-term housing needs to the tragedy of patients too ill to survive evacuation. With Ukrainian patients from 2022 still in Italian hospitals, concerns about future capacity are real.\n\nThe US freeze, meanwhile, highlights a shift toward prioritizing security concerns, even at the cost of halting humanitarian access. With no evidence yet made public, the move is vulnerable to criticism and potential legal challenge.\n\nAs Dr. Pancani concluded: \u201cAs doctors, we want these children not only to recover from their injuries but to regain some stability in their lives. If we are called again, we are ready to rescue other people.\u201d",
