  "description": "As ICE launches a recruitment effort to hire 10,000 more officers, existing staff struggle with long hours, growing public outrage.",
  "content": "WASHINGTON, DC \u2012 Under President Donald Trump, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has become the driving force of his sweeping crackdown on migrants, bolstered by record funding and new latitude to conduct raids, but staff are contending with long hours and growing public outrage over the arrests.\n\nTwo current and nine former ICE officials told Reuters the agency is grappling with burnout and frustration among personnel as agents struggle to keep pace with the administration\u2019s aggressive enforcement agenda.\n\nThe agency has launched a recruitment drive to relieve the stress by hiring thousands of new officers as quickly as possible, but that process will likely take months or years to play out.\n\nAll of those interviewed by Reuters backed immigration enforcement in principle. But they criticized the Trump administration's push for high daily arrest quotas that have led to the detention of thousands of individuals with no criminal record, as well as long-term green card holders, others with legal visas, and even some U.S. citizens.\n\nMost of the current and former ICE officials requested anonymity due to concerns about retaliation against themselves or former colleagues.\n\nAmericans have been inundated with images on social media of often masked agents in tactical gear handcuffing people on neighborhood streets, at worksites, outside schools, churches, and courthouses, and in their driveways. Videos of some arrests have gone viral, fueling public anger over the tactics.\n\nUnder Trump, average daily arrests by the 21,000-strong agency have soared, up over 250% in June compared to a year earlier, although daily arrest rates dropped in July.\n\nTrump has said he wants to deport \"the worst of the worst,\" but ICE figures show a rise in non-criminals being picked up.\n\nICE arrests of people with no other charges or convictions beyond immigration violations during Trump's first six months in office rose to 221 people per day, from 80 people per day during the same period under former President Joe Biden last year, according to agency data obtained by the Deportation Data Project at University of California, Berkeley, School of Law.\n\nSome 69% of immigration arrests under Trump were of people with a criminal conviction or pending charge, the figures show. Some ICE investigators are frustrated that hundreds of specialized ICE investigative agents, who normally focus on serious crimes such as human trafficking and transnational gangs, have been reassigned to routine immigration enforcement, two current and two former officials said.\n\nIn an interview with Reuters, Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, acknowledged that the long hours and reassignment ofspecialist agents had frustrated some ICE personnel but said Trump's January 20 declaration of a national emergency around illegal immigration warranted it.\n\n\"There's some staff that would rather be doing other types of investigations, I get that, but the president declared anational emergency,\" Homan said.\n\nHoman, who spent three decades in immigration enforcement and joined ICE at its inception in 2003, said the long hours should lessen as hiring of new ICE staff speeds up.\n\n\"I think morale is good. I think morale will get even better as we bring more resources on,\" he said.\n\nAnother stress factor for more senior officials is the perpetual threat of being removed for failure to produce arrests,underscored by multiple changes of leadership at ICE since Trump took office in January, five of the ICE officials said.\n\nIn response to a request for comment, a senior official with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, ICE's parent agency, downplayed concerns about morale, saying officers were most bothered by being targeted in assaults, as well as criticism from Democrats.\n\nThe senior official said ICE personnel \"are excited to be able to do their jobs again\" after being subjected to limitsunder Biden.\n\nAt the center of the complaints, the current and former ICE officials said, was the demand by the White House for ICE to sharply increase immigration arrest numbers to about 3,000 a day, 10 times the daily arrest rate last year under Trump's Democratic predecessor.\n\nIn some cases, officers on raids have gone to wrong addresses following leads that relied on artificial intelligence, increasing the chances of picking up the wrong person or putting an officer in danger, according to one current and two former officials.\n\n\u201cThe demands they placed on us were unrealistic. It was not done in a safe manner or the manner to make us most successful,\u201d the current official said.\n\nDuring recent raids in several U.S. cities, masked ICE agents have been confronted by angry residents demanding they identify themselves and chasing them out of neighborhoods.\n\n\"In a lot of communities, they're not looked upon favorably for the work they do. So I'm sure that's stressful for them and their families,\u201d said Kerry Doyle, a former top legal adviser at ICE.\n\nICE also faced backlash during Trump's 2017-2021 presidency, when activists and some Democrats made \"Abolish ICE\" a rallying cry, but the agency's more aggressive enforcement in recent months has further thrust it into the spotlight.Trump's public approval rating on immigration fell to 43% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll in August from a high of 50% in March as Americans took an increasingly dim view of his heavy-handed tactics against migrants.\n\nThat view has been shaped in part by news reports of students being arrested on campuses or on their way to sportspractice, parents being detained while dropping children at school, ICE officers breaking windows and pulling people from cars, and men surrounded and shackled while waiting at bus stops or at Home Depots to travel to work.\n\nOne former ICE official said at the beginning of the administration, several former colleagues told him they were happy the \"cuffs are off.\"\n\nBut several months later, he said, they are \"overwhelmed\" by the arrest numbers the administration is demanding.\n\n\"They would prefer to go back to focused targeting,\" he said. \"They used to be able to say: 'We are arresting criminals.'\"\n\nA Republican-backed spending package passed by the Congress in July gave ICE more money than nearly all other federal law enforcement agencies combined \u2012 $75 billion over a little more than four years \u2012 including funds to detain at least 100,000 migrants at any given time.\n\nThe Trump administration has launched a vigorous recruitment drive on the back of the new funding to meet its goal of hiring 10,000 ICE officers over the next four years.\n\nUsing wartime-style posters and slogans such as \"America needs you,\" ICE has launched a media blitz highly unusual for a government agency, running ads on social media platforms like Instagram and YouTube.\n\nHomeland Security said more than 115,000 \u201cpatriotic Americans\u201d had applied for jobs with ICE, although it did not say over what time period.\n\nThe ICE hiring spree resembles a similar surge to onboard Border Patrol agents in the mid-2000s, which critics sayincreased corruption and misconduct in its ranks.\n\nAsked about the risk of bringing in less qualified people in the rush to staff up, Homan said ICE should choose \u201cquality over quantity.\u201d\n\n\u201cOfficers still need to go through background investigations, they still need to be vetted, they still need to make sure they go to the academy,\u201d Homan said.",

      "text": "ICE is recruiting agents with incentives, massive ad campaigns. Sheriffs aren't happy.\nICE just made it more attractive to become an immigration agent, with a $50k signing bonus. But are they hurting local law enforcement in the process?\nGet ready for ICE to flood your social media feeds.\nDangling bonuses of up to $50,000, federal officials are launching a massive recruitment campaign to hire more than 14,000 immigration agents, attorneys and other workers to help execute President Donald Trump's border crackdown. The president is newly flush with billions in funding and wants to deport 1 million people a year with the help of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.\n\"America needs you,\" reads one of the ICE recruiting ads, featuring a finger-pointing Uncle Sam, evoking World War I recruiting posters. \"America has been invaded by criminals and predators. We need YOU to get them out.\"\nThe federal spending plan finances the hiring of 10,000 new ICE agents, making ICE the single-largest law enforcement agency in the country, larger than the FBI, DEA, ATF and other agencies combined. For comparison, the FBI has only about 13,700 special agents, according to the Justice Department.\nEven before the new hires take their posts, the dramatic expansion of public ICE operations has upset communities from coast to coast and raised questions about the tactics agents have used as they've chased suspects across Home Depot parking lots, farm fields and into medical buildings.\nThe aggressive recruitment efforts have also angered local sheriffs who worry that deputies in already understaffed offices will be lured away by the big bonuses and higher pay.\n\"It is tone-deaf and reflects a total lack of judgment and character on their part,\" Jonathan Thompson, executive director and CEO of the National Sheriff's Association, said of a recruiting offer emailed to local deputies nationwide. \"This is either galactically stupid or purposefully malicious. You're just robbing Peter to pay Paul. And in this case, you're robbing the poorest of Peter to pay the richest of Paul.\"\nThompson said a White House official later called him to apologize about the recruiting email, and to promise to work more collaboratively with the sheriffs.\nMassive media blitz, incentives and job offers\nBolstered by new staffing, federal officials have promised to further flood Democrat-run cities with deportation officers in response to a lack of cooperation in executing Trump's get-tough approach that has targeted undocumented immigrations with or without criminal records.\nThe Department of Homeland Security has already begun hiring for the new jobs. Federal officials are planning a social media blitz to reach recruits, potentially advertising on YouTube and SnapChat, but also on connected TVs via Hulu and Amazon Prime.\nIn addition to the signing bonuses, ICE is offering up to $60,000 in student loan forgiveness, although applicants don't need to have college degrees to be considered for some of the jobs.\nICE officials on July 31 announced they've made 1,000 job offers since Trump signed the funding law. Among those receiving job offers are retired ICE agents who quit during the Biden administration, acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons said in a statement.\n\"They couldn\u2019t do the jobs they signed up to do,\" Lyons said. \"Now, people are lining up to work with us because they know our officers and agents are allowed to enforce immigration law fairly and across the board, and that\u2019s a cause people really believe in.\"\nApplicants 'should expect a certain level of risk'\nWhite House officials say there has been an 830% increase in assaults against agents through July 14 compared with the same period last year, and the recruiting materials say that applicants \"should expect a certain level of risk\" but that they will be trained to take \"every precaution\" to stay safe.\nHow quickly ICE can bring aboard the new employees remains uncertain. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has long struggled to hire Border Patrol agents, who typically take more than 300 days to bring aboard, according to a 2024 GAO study.\nJoe Gamaldi, national vice president of the Fraternal Order of Police union, said he suspects ICE will face the same recruiting challenges as local departments. He said years of demonizing law enforcement by some politicians, activists and media has created a \"toxic cocktail\" that will make hiring challenging.\n\"Truth be told, all police agencies are competing for a small pool of people who are still willing to serve and literally die for their communities,\" he said. \"Bonuses and better pay will help, but ultimately police officers, and those interested in police work, want to serve for an agency and communities that appreciate them and don\u2019t treat them like scum.\"\nLocal sheriffs furious about ICE recruitment\nThe aggressive hiring campaign has frustrated local law enforcement leaders who worry their officers will flock to better-paying federal jobs. Without telling local sheriffs ahead of time, ICE officials directly emailed recruitment offers to hundreds of deputies across the country.\nThompson, of the National Sheriff's Association, said sheriffs feel betrayed by the move. Thompson said sheriffs agreed to send deputies to special immigration enforcement training designed for local police, only to have ICE try to simply poach them away.\n\"It's become a wildfire of discontent, and not how partners treat partners,\" he said. \"This is an embarrassment to this president, and it's sad.\"\nThompson said some sheriff's offices already have vacancies of 40% and predicted the ICE hiring spree could further winnow the ranks of local law enforcement.\nOther policing experts have raised concerns about the risks of hiring so quickly.\nNational security expert and commentator Garrett Graff, who investigated Border Patrol hiring surges after 9/11, said in a Substack post that ICE risks a surge of applications from Americans \"specifically attracted by the rough-em-up, masked secret police tactics, no-holds-barred lawlessness that ICE has pursued since January.\"\nGraff added: \"If you\u2019re excited to dress up like you're taking Fallujah for a raid of hard-working roofers in the Home Depot parking lot, working for ICE or CBP shouldn't be for you.\"\n(This story has been updated to add new information.)"

      "text": "Farmers are facing a fork on Trump's immigration highway. So what's next?\nFarmers say few native\u2013born residents will pick fruit or tend cows. The agriculture worker visa program can be costly, burdensome and limited. And they say Congress has failed to act for years.\nFor Candice Lyall, cherry harvest is always a race against the clock.\nEastern Washington is famous for its cherries, and in the fourth-generation farmer\u2019s lush orchards, not far from Columbia River, there\u2019s just a short window when they are the perfect ripeness. Wait too long and they are too soft for sale.\nAnd they must be picked by hand. Lots of them.\nFinding those hands locally can be a challenge. Like other growers, some of her workers are foreign-born, whose presence is reflected in the Hispanic restaurants in the nearby 3,300-resident town of Mattawa.\nBut this summer the harvest coincided with President Donald Trump\u2019s mass deportation sweeps. Rumors swirled of roadway checkpoints. More than 100 workers who started Lyall\u2019s harvest dwindled to 30 by the second week, leading her farm to struggle to get cherries picked in time.\nSome were picked too late, she said, but the financial hit to her farm was likely to be far less than what some other growers experienced.\n\u201cThere's a lot of farms that didn't pick because they didn't have enough labor,\u201d she said.\nLyall is a Trump supporter in a conservative farming region. She favors stricter border security because of worries of drug cartels. But she wants to see a path toward a stable workforce.\n\u201cThere needs to be some solutions put on the table,\u201d Lyall told USA TODAY.\nAcross the country, Trump\u2019s immigration raids have roiled farms and farming communities \u2013 with cases of worker shortages and fears of unpicked crops. And it has fueled growing calls for the Trump administration to protect agricultural workers critical to the U.S. food supply.\nOf the 2.6 million people working on U.S. farms, about 42% lack legal status, according to the Department of Agriculture and other estimates.\nFarmers say few native\u2013born residents will pick fruit or tend cows. The country\u2019s foreign agriculture worker visa program can be costly, burdensome and limited. And farmers say Congress has failed for decades to pass comprehensive immigration reforms.\nThose long-standing struggles are now compounded by the lurking presence of Trump\u2019s masked immigration forces as harvest season approaches or is underway.\nEarlier this month, raids on farms in California left hundreds detained, and soon after, a group of farmworkers in California held a three-day strike and called for boycotts. At stake are potential disruptions to the U.S. food supply and higher consumer costs.\n\u201cFarm employers are holding their breath, trying to keep operations afloat without knowing whether their workforce will show up tomorrow \u2014 or stay away for fear of a raid,\u201d said Ben Tindall, head of the Save Family Farming advocacy group, based in Washington state.\nThe Trump administration in June suspended farm enforcement but then reversed that decision. More recently, Trump has cited the importance of farm labor and said his administration would look into ways for farmworkers to \u201cbe here legally, they can pay taxes and everything.\u201d\nOther administration officials, including border czar Tom Holman, said there would be no \u201camnesty\u201d but cited ongoing discussions about policy changes related to farmworkers. A bill in Congress would create a legal pathway for longtime workers and streamline worker visas.\nThe push for changes comes amid signs of a shift in public attitudes reflected in a recent Gallup poll that found a record-high of 79% of U.S. adults say immigration is good for the country, while only 35% said they approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the issue.\nManuel Cunha, the president of the Nisei Farmers League, which represents 500 farmers employing about 75,000 California farmworkers, said he\u2019s hopeful that policies will change.\nFor now, he said, workers in places like the San Joaquin Valley are holding steady despite raids that have caused temporary shortages.\nStill, farmers are on edge, knowing it could change at any moment.\nWhy foreign-born workers are critical to farmers\nIn Lincoln County, Wisconsin, where the rural landscape of pastures and fields is dotted with barns and silos, Hans Breitenmoser\u2019s parents emigrated here in 1968 from Switzerland to raise dairy cows on a small farm.\nHe grew up amid the daily rhythms of feeding and milking. When the farm grew, they had to hire more workers. But they could find few native-born residents willing to take the jobs in the sparsely populated area. And over time, fewer younger people were sticking around the farms.\nNow, the 56-year-old relies on about a dozen foreign-born workers, mostly from Mexico, to operate the 460-cow farm, not far from a shuttered church with peeling paint about five miles outside a town of 9,000 residents.\n\u201cIf it wouldn't be for immigrants, my dairy farm wouldn't run,\u201d he said.\nIn recent months, dairy farms in Texas reported absenteeism while ICE has detained or deported people at dairy farms in New York and Vermont, where one Trump-voting farmer told a news outlet he didn\u2019t think deportations would impact the industry\u2019s workers.\nDairies are particularly vulnerable to labor shortages because cows need daily care to survive, Brietenmoser said, and cannot be temporarily shut down like a construction site or restaurant.\n\u201cAm I concerned about it? Absolutely,\u201d said Breitenmoser, who said he was among a minority in Lincoln County who did not support Trump in 2024. \u201cThey don't get fed and they don't get watered, and they don't get milked and they don't get cleaned up after, they will die.\u201d\nAcross the nation today, about 70% of workers in the U.S. farm sector are foreign born, according to the Federal Reserve of Kansas City. The National Milk Producers Federation says milk prices could nearly double if the U.S. dairy industry loses its foreign-born workforce, the group said.\n\u201cThe uncertainty that undergirds agricultural labor and immigration in the U.S. continues to harm workers and their families, farm employers, rural communities and national food security,\u201d according to the federation.\nFarmers typically hire workers with documentation such as Social Security cards or permits the government says must \u201creasonably appear to be genuine.\u201d The government\u2019s E-Verify system, required in some places, isn't foolproof.\nBreitenmoser argues Trump\u2019s political rhetoric painting immigrants as criminals and invaders, when most are workers filling jobs no one else will, is a self-defeating strategy.\n\u201cWe've built an economy that relies on people, but we have a public policy that demonizes them. And to my way of thinking that just doesn't make any sense,\u201d he said. \u201cAmerican farming cannot survive without foreign-born staff.\u201d\nThe dairy farmer noted that \u201cwe had immigration reform in front of the Congress prior to the election, but because all of the Republicans were scared of Donald Trump, it didn't happen.\u201d\nThe solution, he said, is \u201cstupid simple:\u201d Accept the realities of farm labor. Hand out more work visas. And create pathways to vet longtime workers who need legal work permits.\nHe hopes the recent turmoil will lead to long-needed changes.\n\u201cSomebody's going to drive through McDonald's to buy a freaking latte and a hamburger. And guess where that comes from? It comes from my farm. And it doesn't happen magically. It takes human beings, be they brown, Black, White, green or otherwise, to get the job done,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that's what our public policy should reflect.\u201d\nWorkers face stains, worry\nIn a Colorado agricultural area northeast of Denver, Maria has worked in fields of watermelon, pumpkins and tomatoes for years. But not now.\nThe 56-year-old, who didn\u2019t want to use her full name because she doesn\u2019t have legal status, emigrated from Chihuahua, Mexico 20 years ago to escape violence and find better pay.\nJobs on farms are hot, grueling and physically challenging. But some farmworkers can earn in one hour what they\u2019d make in a full day back in Mexico.\nShe said she sees an ICE presence in her part of Colorado. One friend\u2019s brother was detained on the street earlier this year. Her husband is still working in a dairy to make ends meet, but she said some farms have had to look for workers out of state.\nFor now they want to stick it out. Their lives are here. They have children and U.S. citizen grandchildren who live in the United States and are concerned about them.\n\u201cThere's a lot of anxiety about, you know, grandmother, are they going to take you away?\u201d she said.\nMany have reluctantly returned to work after raids that have taken place in places like California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley for financial reasons, said Teresa Romero, head of United Farm Workers.\n\u201cIt is a little misconception, assuming that workers are not going back to work. Some workers are, of course, scared of what could happen,\u201d she said. \u201cThey might be scared for a day or so, but they go back to work. They need their jobs and they need to support their families.\u201d\nRomero said the crackdown is also impacting the communities in which they live and work. Many are staying inside and not going to parks, school functions, churches and restaurants.\nIn raids earlier this month at cannabis farms in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, immigration agents descended on Glass House Farms near Camarillo and in Carpinteria. They clashed with protesters and detained more than 200 farmworkers.\nA Mexican farmworker, Jaime Alan\u00eds Garcia, 57, died after falling from a greenhouse roof he\u2019d climbed atop in an alleged attempt to evade officers, according to multiple reports,\n\u201cThe farmworkers detained in these raids are clearly in the United States to fill jobs that employers cannot otherwise fill,\u201d U.S. Rep. Julia Brownley, D-Thousand Oaks, said in a letter to federal officials. \u201cTheir undocumented status is not by choice, but a direct result of Congress\u2019 ongoing failure to pass comprehensive immigration reform that would allow a sufficient number of workers into the country and provide a viable pathway to citizenship.\u201d\nThat\u2019s what Gabriel, a 42-year-old from Puebla, Mexico, who didn\u2019t want to use his name because he lacks legal status and fears detention, would like to see, too. The farmwork in California\u2019s Central Valley has lived in the U.S. for 25 years. He has worked in fields of crops from eggplant to pumpkin, waking up at 4 a.m. and earning $16.50 an hour.\nHe said the majority of his fellow workers are also immigrants without papers and are still working, but some are considering going home.\nHe blames past and current administrations for failing to deliver on immigration reform. He said some longtime workers were angry at former President Joe Biden for enacting more legal pathways to migrate and not focusing on legalizing the status of longtime workers.\n\u201cLet workers work,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are people who help feed the country and pay taxes.\u201d\nEven legally present farmworkers are uneasy.\nICE officials have argued they don\u2019t need probable cause to detain people and the agency could deport people with just six hours\u2019 notice.\nMaurico Sol, an H-2A worker who supervises dozens of fellow visa holders on a farm that spans Idaho and Oregon, said some colleagues have asked if it\u2019s safe to go to Walmart on weekends. He advised them to always carry their passport and visa.\n\u201cI\u2019ve also heard people that say, well, maybe this is going to be my last year,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it feels different \u2026 Even when we are in a good space here, where it's not happening a lot, you feel like, eh, we don't know. We don't want to go out. Because maybe they're going to confuse me if they see me in the mall and I'm going to be chained for, I don't know, 48 hours, or maybe they're going to deport me even though I have papers.\u201d\nA search for a solution\nSol works for Shay Myers, a farmer whose onions grow in fields not far from where the Snake River separates Oregon and Idaho.\nThe third-generation farmer operates Owyhee Produce, which grows one in every 20 onions consumed in America.\nMyers, 45, is also TikTok influencer with 692,000 followers and posts videos about his farm and the intricacies of agriculture.\nBut lately the Republican farmer has been highlighting his mostly foreign-born laborers \u2013 from Mexico, Central America, Peru and Colombia \u2013 who he says are critical. The majority of his workers, which can number 350 during harvests, are here on H-2A visas.\nWhile such workers represent about 13% of the nation's farmworkers, the number of certified H-2A workers grew by 64.7% between 2017 and 2022. Meanwhile, the share of unauthorized workers has dropped to about 42% from from 55% in 2001.\nBut it\u2019s also a bureaucratic and expensive program, he said. Farmers have to prove no domestic workers are available or willing to do the job. They provide housing and adhere to wage-premiums meant to keep the program from pushing down wages of U.S. residents who do similar jobs, and must follow rules such as overtime that differ among states. And it\u2019s time-limited.\nLabor groups also criticize the H-2A visa program, saying it often requires workers to stick with one employer which makes them vulnerable to wage theft or poor housing.\nMyers said that\u2019s not the case at his farm. He grew up and went to school in the area with undocumented families. And today his children do, too.\n\u201cWe lose from every angle. The right-wingers come at us \u2026 \u2018You won't give jobs to Americans,\u201d Myers said. \u201cAnd then the left wing side of the discussion is, well, all you do is bring H-2A workers and they work for you like slaves.\u201d\nHe, too, wants a more flexible worker program and creating a path to legal status for undocumented workers here for 10 years and longer. He said the deportations have proved a problem both ethically for farm families and economically for the industry.\n\u201cLet's find a solution,\u201d he said on one video.\nEarlier this month, Trump suggested in Iowa \u2013 a leading corn and pork producer that relies heavily on migrant workers \u2013 that his administration would seek to permit some migrants without legal status to stay on farms, the Des Moines Register, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported.\n\"If a farmer\u2019s willing to vouch for these people, in some way, Kristi, I think we\u2019re going to have to just say that\u2019s going to be good, right?\" he said, referencing Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem who was with him on the Iowa trip. \"You know, we\u2019re going to be good with it. Because we don\u2019t want to do it where we take all of the workers off the farms. We want the farms to do great like they\u2019re doing right now.\"\nU.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins cited plans to make the H-2A program \u201ccheaper, more efficient and more effective for those farmers.\u201d\nThe United Farm Workers favors paths to legal status for those already here over simply expanding the guestworker program for new arrivals, who they say would still be more prone to labor abuses.\nIn Congress, Republican U.S. Reps. Mar\u00eda Elvira Salazar of Florida, and Veronica Escobar of Texas introduced the DIGNITY Act. Among its many provisions is a seven-year earned legal status program allowing undocumented immigrants to live and work legally, with renewable status based on good conduct and restitution.\n\"We have 10 million people or more working in construction, hospitality, agriculture, dairy, fisheries, slaughterhouses who are undocumented but are not criminals,\" Salazar said at a news conference.\nBut House Speaker Mike Johnson told the Wall Street Journal that immigration overhauls would face an uphill battle.\nRollins has also suggested that the country could fill jobs with Americans who will face Medicaid work requirements, something farmers immediately shot down.\nFarming groups call for realism\nCunha, head of Nisei Farmers League, was among those very blunt about that idea: \u201cThat's just not going to work,\u201d he said.\nHe knows firsthand.\nIn 1998, during President Bill Clinton\u2019s Welfare-to-Work push, Cunha helped launch an effort in 10 California counties to recruit welfare recipients and unemployed workers to help fill tens of thousands of farmworker jobs.\nPeople would be aided with child care, transportation and training. Just 500 people applied. And only three took jobs. None of them lasted more than two days, he said. Crops were lost.\n\u2018It was a total disaster,\u201d he said.\nA similar result took place in North Carolina, according to a 2013 report by the Partnership for a New American Economy and the Center for Global Development. When North Carolina had more than 489,000 unemployed residents, a growers association offered 6,500 jobs. Of 245 domestic workers hired, only seven lasted the entire season.\nIt's not likely he contended that higher wages alone would have Americans flocking to the jobs, he argued. Not only can the work be physically grueling or dangerous, Cunha said it is not the unskilled work that many people assume. It takes experience and skill to prune a fruit tree or know which fruits to pick now and which to return for later.\nAt a recent farm training in California that included topics like heat illness, Cunha said workers instead were full of questions about avoiding run-ins with ICE.\nShould they drive different routes or not wear hats and bandanas? One asked if he should shave his beard to look less like a farmworker.\nFor now, he said, as the area\u2019s remaining harvests are closing in, it's stressful for both farmers and farmworkers.\n\u201cLabor is tight, but it's holding. And as long as \u2013 we pray every day \u2013 they stay out of the valley, then we'll make it through this season,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we do need to deal with it. We should not have to go through this type of tension. And workers should not have to worry about shaving their beard.\u201d"

Effective immediately, it applies to people applying for a student or worker visa, or a green card.\nSeparately, USCIS said Aug. 15 that it will put citizenship applicants through \"a holistic assessment\" of behavior, including judging their \"adherence to societal norms and positive contributions that affirmatively demonstrate good moral character.\"\nDavid Bier, director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the criteria for determining \"anti-American ideologies\" and \"good moral character\" are vague and risk further bogging down an already overburdened legal immigration system.\n\"We don't really know how it will be enforced,\" he told USA TODAY, adding that, for the Trump administration, \"the goal is to slow down immigration and reduce the number of people coming in by any means necessary.\"\nRobert McCaw, government affairs director for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said he sees an anti-Palestinian bias in the new rules that amount to \"ideological tests.\"\n\"Immigrants should not have to choose between their immigration status and their conscience,\" he said.\nThe Trump administration has sought to deport multiple student protesters who support Palestinian rights amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, calling some demonstrations antisemitic.\nUSCIS reviews hundreds of thousands of applications for work permits, legal permanent residency cards and naturalization each year. The agency already collects applicants' biometrics and makes an exhaustive review of their eligibility, including screening out applicants with ties to terrorism.\nElizabeth Jacobs, director of regulatory affairs and policy at the right-leaning Center for Immigration Studies, said immigration officers have typically checked for ties to terrorism in their applications reviews.\n\u201cImmigration officers probably have always been able to deny on that basis of anti-American ideology or activities,\u201d Jacobs, a former USCIS counsel, said. \u201cBut what they're doing here is they're being explicit about it.\""

      "text": "Case of jailed trucker puts a spotlight on Trump immigration policy\nAn Indian trucker, in the US illegally, is accused of causing a fatal accident in Florida. Now the Trump administration is cracking down on all immigrant truckers.\nA fatal Florida crash blamed on a trucker who the Trump administration says is an undocumented immigrant is drawing new attention to the White House's crackdown on commercial drivers. Harjinder Singh remains jailed on charges that he killed three people in a minivan Aug. 12 when he illegally made a U-turn across a Florida highway.\nAn international petition calling for Gov. Ron DeSantis to offer clemency has drawn more than 2.8 million signatures of support, arguing that while tragic, the crash was a \"catastrophic accident\" and that Singh shouldn't face vehicular manslaughter charges.\n\"While accountability matters, the severity of the charges against him does not align with the circumstances of the incident,\" says the petition, organized by advocates calling themselves \"Collective Punjabi Youth.\" \"By granting clemency, you would reaffirm the value of proportional justice, the power of community advocacy, and the potential for rehabilitation.\"\nDeSantis responded in a Aug. 25 social-media post: \"If you're driving as an illegal alien in Florida, you will face the consequences.\" Singh, originally from India, entered the United States illegally through the Mexico border in 2018, according to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. The names of the three people who died in the crash have not been released, and video purporting to be from the cab of his truck appears to show Singh react to the crash with almost no remorse.\nThe St. Lucie public defender's office, which has been provisionally appointed to represent Singh but had not yet been formally appointed, did not immediately respond to a USA TODAY request for comment on Aug. 25.\nThe petition comes as federal officials are scrutinizing the millions of commercial truckers for English-language ability and whether they have legal permission to be working. Some states permit people to get driver's licenses even if they are living in the country without the correct documentation. \"This gut-wrenching tragedy should have never happened,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a social media statement.\" My team (will work with their Transportation Department counterparts) to root out and prevent illegal aliens from obtaining these licenses from sanctuary jurisdictions that put American drivers and passengers in danger.\"\nAmong the moves taken or being considered by the White House:\n- A temporary pause on granting new visas to international truckers seeking to work in the United States, announced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Aug. 21.\n- Lifting of an Obama-era limit on checking truckers for English ability. For decades, holders of commercial driver's licenses were required to demonstrate proficiency in oral and written English, to ensure they understood signs and could communicate effectively with other drivers and emergency workers. That rule was suspended in 2016 but reinstated in June.\n- Investigating what are known as \"non-domiciled\" CDLs issued by states to non-residents, which is the kind of California CDL that Singh held, according to federal officials.\n- Reviewing fake CDLs experts say are sometimes issued by unscrupulous American trucking schools or bribed Mexican bureaucrats.\n- Clamping down on falsified medical paperwork by switching CDL holders to electronic records."

      "text": "The Trump administration is telling immigrants 'Carry your papers.' Here's what to know.\nImmigrants have long been required to carry ID proving they're in the US legally, but the rule was not enforced. Until now.\nAmid the Trump administration's ongoing crackdown on illegal immigration, the nation's immigration service is warning immigrants to carry their green card or visa at all times.\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services posted the reminder July 23 on social media: \"Always carry your alien registration documentation. Not having these when stopped by federal law enforcement can lead to a misdemeanor and fines.\"\nHere's what immigrants \u2013 and American citizens \u2013 need to know.\n'Carry your papers' law isn't new\nThe law requiring lawful immigrants and foreign visitors to carry their immigration documents has been on the books for decades, dating to the 1950s.\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act states: \"Every alien, eighteen years of age and over, shall at all times carry with him and have in his personal possession any certificate of alien registration or alien registration receipt card issued to him.\"\nBut the law had rarely been imposed before the Trump administration announced earlier this year that it would strictly enforce it.\nThe \"carry your papers\" portion fell out of use for cultural and historical reasons, said Michelle Lapointe, legal director of the nonprofit American Immigration Council.\nIn contrast to the Soviet bloc at the time the requirement was written, \"We have never been a country where you have to produce evidence of citizenship on demand from law enforcement.\"\nIn a \"Know Your Rights\" presentation, the ACLU cautions immigrants over age 18 to follow the law and \"carry your papers with you at all times.\"\n\"If you don\u2019t have them,\" the ACLU says, \"tell the officer that you want to remain silent, or that you want to consult a lawyer before answering any questions.\"\nA 'precious' document at risk\nMany immigrants preferred to hold their green card or visa in safe-keeping, because, like a passport, they are expensive and difficult to obtain.\nHistorically, it was \"a little risky for people to carry these precious documents such as green card, because there is a hefty fee to replace it and they are at risk of not having proof of status \u2013 a precarious position to be in,\" Lapointe said.\nBut as immigration enforcement has ramped up, the risks of not carrying legal documents have grown.\nFailure to comply with the law can result in a $100 fine, or imprisonment of up to 30 days.\nImmigration enforcement and 'racial profiling'\nU.S. citizens aren't required to carry documents that prove their citizenship.\nBut in an environment of increasing immigration enforcement, Fernando Garcia, executive director of the nonprofit Border Network for Human Rights in El Paso, Texas, said he worries about U.S. citizens being targeted.\n\"With massive raids and mass deportation, this takes a new dimension,\" he said. \"How rapidly are we transitioning into a 'show me your papers' state?\"\n\"The problem is there are a lot of people \u2013 Mexicans, or Central Americans \u2013 who are U.S. citizens who don\u2019t have to carry anything, but they have the burden of proof based on racial profiling,\" he said. \"There are examples of U.S. citizens being arrested already, based on their appearance and their race.\"\nAmerican citizens targeted by ICE\nThe Trump administration's widening immigration crackdown has already netted American citizens.\nIn July, 18-year-old Kenny Laynez, an American citizen, was detained for six hours by Florida Highway Patrol and Border Patrol agents. He was later released.\nFederal agents also detained a California man, Angel Pina, despite his U.S. citizenship in July. He was later released.\nElzon Limus, a 23-year-old U.S. citizen from Long Island, New York, decried his arrest by ICE agents in June, after he was released. In a video of the arrest, immigration agents demand Limus show ID, with one explaining he \"looks like somebody we are looking for.\"\nIn updated guidance, attorneys at the firm of Masuda, Funai, Eifert & Mitchell, which has offices in Chicago, Detroit and Los Angeles, advise U.S. who are concerned about being stopped and questioned \"to carry a U.S. passport card or a copy of their U.S. passport as evidence of U.S. citizenship.\"\nLauren Villagran can be reached at lvillagran@usatoday.com."

      "text": "New data show the US's immigrant population declining dramatically. Is it true?\nThe monthly Current Population Survey shows a dramatic drop but the data is less reliable than other Census tools.\nThe country's immigrant population may have dropped by roughly 2 million people in the first six months of the year, according to new government data.\nThe new data offer an early \u2013 if imperfect \u2013 signal that President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown may already be showing an impact.\nSteven Camarota, director of research at the right-leaning Center for Immigration Studies, said the estimated decline of 2.2 million foreign-born people in the Current Population Survey was the largest such drop in a single year in three decades.\nEither \"something has fundamentally changed in America, or the response rate has dramatically changed,\" he said.\nDemographers say it might be both \u2013 but either way, the new data has significant limits.\nJed Kolko, senior fellow at the nonpartisan Peterson Institute for International Economics, cautioned that \"there aren\u2019t other current data that can corroborate this enormous estimated decline.\"\n\"Even with fewer immigrants coming to the U.S. and more people leaving or being deported, an annual rate of 4 million is an extraordinary number that is way outside the range of immigration estimates that leading researchers have made,\" said Kolko, who served as Undersecretary of Commerce under President Joe Biden.\nIs the data accurate?\nThe Census surveys 60,000 households every month for the Current Population Survey, which tracks fluctuations in population. That compares to the less frequent, but more reliable, American Community Survey, which is underpinned by interviews with 2 million households.\nBecause it's smaller, the population survey may occasionally overstate or understate population shifts, and demographers say it could be years before a full picture emerges.\nJulia Gelatt, associate director of U.S. immigration policy at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, said the monthly survey \"is a really important and helpful tool, but one of its flaws is that it has a small sample size.\"\nThe monthly survey data, produced in conjunction with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, has shown \"increased volatility\" in native-born and foreign-born populations in recent years, according to the Census Bureau, and isn't designed to measure immigration levels.\nAre immigrants afraid to answer accurately?\nBetween the Trump administration's sprawling crackdown on illegal immigration and the onslaught of zero-tolerance messaging, it's possible that some survey respondents are now too scared to tell the government whether they or members of their household are immigrants.\nThat could lead to an undercount, Gelatt said.\n\"Because of the atmosphere \u2013 the mass deportation campaigns, the constant announcements \u2013 immigrants might be more reticent,\" she said. \"They may be afraid to say they are a noncitizen.\"\nMigration surged after the pandemic\nThe post-pandemic wave of immigrants contributed to the country's fastest population growth in more than two decades.\nIn December, the Census Bureau announced it had updated its methodology to better measure the wave of migration to the United States that followed the global COVID-19 pandemic.\nMore than 7 million people immigrated to the United States between April 2020 and June 2024, according to the Census Bureau \u2013 a \"net\" estimate that subtracts all the foreign-born people who left during the period.\nYears of surging migration to the United States angered millions of Americans, who saw failed border security in the masses of asylum-seekers awaiting processing at the U.S.-Mexico border during the Biden administration.\nReversing the migration trend\nDuring his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump vowed to reverse the trend.\nHe promised to deport 1 million immigrants this year, and his administration has employed aggressive tactics to deliver on it: from a plan to hire 10,000 more deportation agents, to using military aircraft to return immigrants to their home countries, to terminating immigrants' right to post bond when they are detained.\nAlthough deportations have increased, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement data suggest the number may fall well short of 1 million this year.\nICE has reported 246,000 removals so far this fiscal year, which began in October 2024 and ends Sept. 30 and includes more than three months of data under the Biden administration.\nBut some other immigrants, here legally or illegally, have chosen to return voluntarily to their home countries. If the population survey is an accurate count, it would represent a mass exodus.\n\"The trend has been down, down, down \u2013 which we normally never see,\" Camarota said.\nLauren Villagran can be reached at lvillagran@usatoday.com."

      "text": "These ICE agents have a new way to target and capture immigrants\nForest Service officers, typically focused on preventing fires, are cooperating with ICE and border patrol.\nPHOENIX \u2012 The Customs and Border Protection aircraft circled the desert northeast of Phoenix until agents spotted their target getting into a white sedan. Officers on the ground converged and arrested the driver. His crime: shooting a rifle within the boundaries of Tonto National Forest.\nAfter he was stopped, the man, Alejandro Antelo Corrales, admitted to being in the country illegally.\nHe would become one of 15 people arrested since May and charged with having a firearm or ammunition while being in the country without authorization, a federal felony. Each person likely faces deportation after their criminal case is done.\nAcross the country, immigration agents have targeted restaurant kitchens. In California, agents have picked up day laborers waiting for work outside Home Depot stores.\nNational forests represent a unique hunting ground for immigration patrols.\nU.S. Forest Service officers would typically be on the lookout for target shooters who could spark a forest fire, but it is not clear why immigration authorities would be involved in such an operation.\nThe archives of The Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network, do not contain an account of a similar immigration enforcement action centered on target shooters.\nImmigration agents part of joint federal operation\nAll but one of the arrests since May took place in the Tonto National Forest, an area popular with off-road enthusiasts and target shooters. Six of the arrests took place on weekend nights, with one as late as 11:55 p.m.\nSpanish-speaking off-road enthusiasts have planned desert parties on social media, with some fliers making clear that weapons are prohibited. It is not clear if these arrests came in the aftermath of one of those events.\nNeither the Border Patrol nor Homeland Security Investigations would comment on the extent of the agencies\u2019 patrols in the area. Neither would the United States Department of Agriculture, the agency that oversees the U.S. Forest Service officers who have made some of the arrests.\nAn attorney who is representing one of the men arrested said the patrols turned Forest Service officers into quasi-immigration agents.\n\u201cIt\u2019s creative, I\u2019ll give them that,\u201d said attorney Joshua Kolsrud, who spent 14 years as a prosecutor before becoming a defense attorney in 2021.\nKolsrud said the arrests would be used to bolster fears of dangerous immigrants on the loose within the community.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll make that argument going forward,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not just removing or deporting regular Joe Blow, but dangerous people because they\u2019re possessing firearms.\u201d\nKolsrud said his client, Adalberto Contreras-Regalado, was not dangerous. He was a husband and businessman who, like many Arizonans, enjoyed target shooting in the desert on his days off.\nContreras-Regalado joined other men who have been arrested in joint operations involving the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, Homeland Security agents and Border Patrol agents, according to court records.\nThe criminal complaints say the men arrested first captured the attention of law enforcement because they were shooting recklessly in the desert.\nIt is not clear why immigration authorities were in the area, waiting to take the shooters into custody.\nShooting restrictions meant to limit forest fires\nCertain activities in Tonto National Forest were restricted starting May 1 because of severe drought. Among the prohibited activities were campfires and target shooting. Signs saying so were placed near the entrance to the recreational area.\nBullets can cause blazes.\nSomeone firing a weapon started the Bullet Fire in June 2023, which charred 3,240 acres in Tonto National Forest. That blaze, which took place in the same area where these immigration arrests are taking place, briefly closed the state highway and necessitated the evacuation of two camping areas.\nForest Service rangers, officially called law enforcement officers, have the primary mission of protecting natural resources and visitors, according to the agency website. Other parts of their job, according to the website, include investigating timber theft, enforcing traffic laws on forest roads and aiding with search and rescue missions.\nTheir job would naturally extend to patrols to enforce shooting restrictions put in place to prevent forest fires.\nIt is not clear why immigration authorities have become interested in people whose initial crime was target shooting.\nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the air support was provided at the request of the U.S. Forest Service but would not say why.\nA fact sheet for the air unit says it concentrates on preventing acts of terrorism and stopping the flow of contraband. Another section of the website says it aids in search and rescue operations and events designated as national security priorities. The website contains a photo above a stadium hosting a Super Bowl.\nA spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Yasmeen Pitts O\u2019Keefe, said that the agency partnered with other federal agencies since it was created \u201cin furtherance of public safety.\u201d\nShe did not specifically comment on a July arrest made by what was described in a criminal complaint as a \u201cjoint patrol\u201d of the U.S. Forest Service and Homeland Security Investigations.\nThe U.S. Forest Service released a statement that said it routinely notifies other agencies if it comes across violations. The office did not address how often it has conducted joint patrols with immigration authorities.\nThe enforcement comes during a year when President Donald Trump has vowed a mass deportation effort with a goal of 1 million deportations this year. Trump and immigration officials have vowed to prioritize public safety threats.\nTarget shooters face arrest, trial, likely deportation\nThe first immigration-related arrests for target shooting came May 3. Four officers with the U.S. Forest Service saw a group of five people target shooting on pits created by recreational users for that purpose, according to court papers.\nOne agent told the men, in Spanish, that target shooting was prohibited because of an order that had taken effect two days before. The men said they had used the area for target shooting several times before, according to the complaint.\nWhen questioned, each man told the agents what guns they owned, according to the court papers. Each, when asked, also handed an agent a Mexican identification card when asked for ID, the court record says.\nEach man also told the agent they were in the country illegally, the court record shows, with two of them volunteering that they had been deported before.\nEach was taken into ICE custody and subsequently charged with a felony for illegally possessing a weapon.\nAnother arrest came after agents with the Bureau of Land Management in February reported seeing a man shooting weapons in what they described in court papers was an \u201cunsafe manner.\u201d\nThat man showed rangers the five rifles he had in the bed of his pickup truck, court papers say. Rangers seized one, and let him leave the area, located outside of Phoenix, with the other four.\nNearly three months later, agents from three agencies \u2012 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, the FBI and the IRS \u2012 converged on the man\u2019s Glendale home.\nThe man, Contreras-Regalado, opened a safe for agents, who seized the eight weapons inside, according to the criminal complaint filed in court. Asked why he had so many weapons, the man said that he \u201cenjoyed shooting.\u201d\nContreras-Regalado\u2019s attorney, Kolsrud, said that the government likely trained so many agencies on the house expecting to find a kingpin committing financial crimes.\n\u201cBut it didn\u2019t turn out that way for them,\u201d Kolsrud said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to bring out every three-letter agency to search someone\u2019s house unless you think he\u2019s a high-level operative.\u201d\nContreras-Regalado was charged with illegally possessing a firearm. His trial is scheduled for September.\nMore arrests took place on patrols on separate nights in July and August. The criminal complaint in each of the cases mentioned a joint- or multi-agency operation. Court records related to three arrests on Aug. 2 mentioned use of a Customs and Border Protection air unit.\nAnother man wanted for possessing a weapon despite being in the country illegally has a warrant out for his arrest. On May 25, Forest Service rangers saw the man shooting near the dry creek bed in the Tonto National Forest.\nRangers spoke with the man\u2019s girlfriend, who allowed a search of their vehicle. Rangers, according to court documents, found ammunition she said her boyfriend purchased earlier that day.\nMonths later, a grand jury presented with the evidence returned a two-count indictment against the man. But he has not faced the charges.\nAs rangers approached, according to a court document, he walked into the desert and could not be found."

      "text": "Army base used for WWII Japanese internment will be nation's largest ICE detention center\nStewards of Japanese American history are calling out the use of Fort Bliss to detain immigrants.\nFORT BLISS, TX \u2013 Americans of Japanese heritage say they hear echoes of their families' forced internment in the Trump administration's newest immigrant detention site.\nHomeland Security officials say President Donald Trump's sweeping mass deportation campaign requires a build-up of detention centers to bridge the gap between arrests and removals. They've turned to the U.S. military and private contractors to get the job done, including erecting the nation's largest immigrant detention site on Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas.\nBut stewards of Japanese American history, including the children and grandchildren of those who were held in detention, are criticizing the use of Fort Bliss and the plans to expand immigrant detention on American military bases.\nFort Bliss was a \"cog\" in the United States Japanese internment machine, said Brian Niiya, a historian and content director at Densho, a nonprofit that chronicles Japanese American internment.\nNiiya's own grandfather, the managing editor of a Japanese language newspaper, was arrested the night of Japan's Pearl Harbor attack, on Dec. 7, 1941, in Honolulu and held in six different internment camps over the next two years.\n\"It\u2019s important to look to this past to maybe try to understand what\u2019s going on in the present and what the end results could be,\" he said.\nDHS: Detaining the 'worst of the worst'\nThe Fort Bliss facility, known locally as Camp East Montana, rises like a white tent city on a flat desert plain. It falls within the confines of the military base but is visible from El Paso's bustling Montana Avenue and sits adjacent to an unmarked building that is the local headquarters of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nAt a cost of $1.2 billion, the camp has the capacity to detain 5,000 people. Roughly 1,000 men were being held there in mid-August, according to U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, an El Paso Democrat whose district includes Fort Bliss.\nTricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, called comparisons between detention centers for people in the country illegally and World War II internment camps \u201cderanged and lazy.\u201d\n\"The facts are ICE is targeting the worst of the worst \u2013 including murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles and rapists,\" she said in a statement.\nA Cato Institute analysis of government data in June found ICE was arresting four times more noncriminals each week on the streets than people with convictions. ICE's own data show that 45% of the roughly 59,000 people in custody in mid-August had no criminal record or charges.\nMike Ishii, executive director and co-founder of Tsuru for Solidarity, an immigrant rights advocacy group, said he sees parallels with the current administration \u201ccoming in and removing people from their homes, from their workplaces, often with no explanations.\u201d\nIshii, whose family was held at the Minidoka concentration camp in Idaho, said, \u201cRight now, it's very frightening for people,\u201d he said. \u201cIn 1941, it was also frightening.\u201d\n'No accounts of wrongdoing'\nEighty years ago, Fort Bliss housed dozens of people labeled \"alien enemies\" by the government in a detention camp that included two compounds surrounded by double barbed wire fences, according to Densho.\nSmaller numbers of immigrants from Germany and Italy were also sent there after the United States joined the European Allies and declared war against those countries.\nAt least 113 first-generation Japanese Americans were shipped to the base before being sent to other holding areas across the country, according to records compiled by Ireiz\u014d, a nonprofit database of Japanese Americans held in internment.\nThe people detained at Bliss were immigrants. They would be the first in the eventual internment of over 125,000 Japanese Americans across the country, most of them U.S. citizens.\nFor the vast majority, \"there were no accounts of wrongdoing other than being seen as 'enemy aliens,'\" said Karen Umemoto, director of the Asian American Studies Center at the University of California, Los Angeles.\nThe 1798 Alien Enemies Act\nAfter Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the American government viewed Japanese immigrants and Japanese Americans as potential traitors, Umemoto said. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt immediately invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to detain people and confiscate their property.\nTrump invoked the same law this year to designate some immigrants as \"alien enemies\" and target them for rapid deportation. The Supreme Court has blocked him on certain removals.\nThe Biden administration also used Fort Bliss to house migrants who crossed the border as unaccompanied children.\nUnder Biden, the Fort Bliss \"emergency intake site\" run by a private contractor was used to process the children for admission into the United States \u2013 not for deportation. Still, survivors and descendants of Japanese internment staged a protest at the facility in 2021 to call attention to the poor conditions there, including problems related to child safety and case management that were later documented in a 2022 federal report.\nAsked about the base's history of internment, the Pentagon referred USA TODAY to an Aug. 7 news briefing in which spokeswoman Kingsley Wilson said Fort Bliss would \"be the largest federal detention center in history for this critical mission, the deportation of illegal aliens.\"\nLearning lessons from history\nAt midday on Aug. 21, construction and passenger vehicles came and went from the Fort Bliss camp. Puffy, storybook clouds hung in a pale blue sky.\nThere was no signage on the road to announce the facility, other than warnings affixed to plywood: \"All vehicles subject to search. No cameras, cellphones or video recorders allowed.\"\nAs historians, Niiya said, \"We always used to say that it's important to know this (history) so that we can prevent things from ever happening again\u2026 But perhaps we can't say that anymore.\""

      "text": "Immigrants forced to eat 'like a dog' in 'overcrowded and chaotic' detention centers\nA Human Rights Watch report said three Miami detention facilities subject people to inhumane, at times life-threatening, conditions.\nForced to eat the day's only meal \"like a dog,\" with their hands shackled behind their back. Detained for days with nothing but shoes for a pillow and no other bedding \u2012 just cold, concrete floors and constant fluorescent lighting. Medical care that denied a man with diabetes insulin for a week and may have contributed to at least one death.\nA Human Rights Watch report says three Miami immigrant detention facilities have subjected people to conditions so inhumane they have become, at times, life-threatening. Many ICE detention facilities are becoming overcrowded and conditions are deteriorating, according to the July 21 report.\nThe report, which drew from the testimonials of 17 detainees, examined conditions since President Donald Trump took office in January. Investigators say conditions at the Krome North Processing Center, Federal Detention Center and Broward Transitional Center flout international law on holding people in immigrant detention and federal government standards.\nThe conditions for people held in the detention facilities \u201care not the way that any legitimate, functioning government should treat people within its custody,\u201d report author and editor Alison Leal Parker, deputy director of the Human Rights Watch\u2019s US Program, said.\nWhile the facilities have had issues predating this administration, Parker said Trump administration officials have been unwilling to uphold standards to properly treat immigrant detainees. The conditions indicate the system is \"overwhelmed, overcrowded and chaotic,\" she said.\nTricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, said claims of subprime conditions at Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers are \u201cFALSE.\u201d\n\u201cAll detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with their family members and lawyers,\u201d McLaughlin said in an emailed statement. \u201cEnsuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE. ICE has higher detention standards than most U.S. prisons that hold actual U.S. citizens.\u201d\nSouthern, Republican-led states have emerged as key partners in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. Florida stood up a tent city called \"Alligator Alcatraz.\" Georgia is expanding its largest ICE detention center. And Louisiana is hosting the most dedicated ICE facilities outside Texas.\nTime at all three facilities\nEntrepreneur Harpinder Singh Chauhan, 56, spent time at all three facilities during nearly four months as a detainee, beginning in February.\nThe British national, who first entered the country on an E-2 investor visa in 2016, opened small businesses in Florida. One of them failed \u2012 a franchise of Dickey's Barbecue Pit, which also bankrupted many other franchisees. He and his wife were seeking permanent residency through a valid EB-5 visa petition when their business collapsed.\nWhile Chauhan was never convicted of crimes, he was ordered to pay restitution to Florida for tax issues, court records show. In February, he was turned over to ICE after a routine probation check-in.\nAt the Krome facility, he spent days in cold, crowded processing cells without beds or showers. He said he was denied medical care, including insulin for his diabetes and an inhaler for his asthma. He used his shoes as a pillow.\nDuring a tuberculosis outbreak, he said the facility had no soap. Instead, staff made detainees use shampoo to wash their hands. Detainees jokingly said everyone had \u201cKrome\u2019s disease,\u201d a play on Chrohn's disease, a chronic gastrointestinal illness, Chauhan recalled.\nDetainees were beaten for protesting their treatment, and one man was hogtied, the report said. Officials also used solitary confinement as punishment, according to women who spoke to Human Rights Watch. In June, detainees at Krome signaled \u201cSOS\u201d to news cameras from the yard over conditions.\nThe report said women were placed at Krome, a privately operated men\u2019s facility, where they were crowded in small holding cells without gender-appropriate care or privacy. USA TODAY reported on similar conditions inside Krome, where one man died \u2012 an incident Human Rights Watch suspects may have been linked to medical neglect.\nAkima, a private Alaska Native Corporation that operates Krome, didn\u2019t respond to USA TODAY\u2019s request for comment. But in response to a Human Rights Watch letter summarizing findings and questions, the company said it couldn\u2019t comment publicly on the specifics of its \"engagement\" with the government, according to the report.\n'Like a dog'\nMidway through his detention, on April 15, Chauhan was placed inside a crowded Federal Detention Center holding cell awaiting transfer without a meal for the day. Styrofoam food containers sat full for hours on other side of the federal prison\u2019s bars.\nIn the evening, he and others finally received food. But with their hands shackled at their waist, they were forced to eat by putting their faces to bite into potatoes rolling around, rice and dry chicken, he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to kind of prop it up with your knees and then eat out of it like a dog,\u201d Chauhan said. Another 21-year-old detainee interviewed by Human Rights Watch also described being forced to eat like an animal.\nThe 25 to 30 men forced to eat this way were transferred from the facility several hours later, Chauhan said.\nLess than a week later, at Broward, Chauhan collapsed in the heat awaiting dinner and was taken to a hospital, with no information given to his family. He had not had his insulin for nearly a week. A 44-year-old Haitian woman, Marie Ange Blaise, died at the facility in April, following a medical emergency that was not treated urgently, according to Human Rights Watch and advocates.\n\"We strongly believe her death could have been prevented,\" Guerline Jozef, director of the nonprofit Haitian Bridge Alliance told USA TODAY at the time. \"We will continue to demand accountability and protection for people in ICE custody.\"\nGEO Group, which operates Broward, denied the report's allegations, including questions about Chauhan's account.\nThe facility has around-the-clock access to medical care, as well as access to visitations, libraries, translation services and amenities, Christopher Ferreira, a spokesperson for the company, said in a statement. Support services are monitored by ICE, including on-site personnel, and other organizations within DHS.\nA 'dark time' in US\nChauhan was ordered deported and boarded a flight back to the United Kingdom on June 5. His family, including two adult children, stayed in Florida to close what remains of their businesses.\nNow living outside London, Chauhan said he plans to keep paying his Florida debt. Even though his family is ready to leave, he hopes to one day return to America.\n\u201cEvery nation goes through a dark time,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel this is just a test.\u201d\nLauren Villagran contributed to this report.\nEduardo Cuevas is based in New York City.

      "text": "Deported from US, these social media influencers are now monetizing their misfortune\nMore than 70,000 Mexicans were deported from the US in the first six months of the year. Now, they're (re)building lives south of the border.\nDeported and alone, Annie Garcia landed in Mexico with $40 in her pocket, a criminal record in the United States behind her and an unknown future ahead in a country she barely remembered.\nFast forward to the present, to a video shared with her more than half-a-million social media followers in August. Her hair blows in the wind as she speeds on a boat through an emerald sea. She tagged the clip: #LifeAfterDeportation.\nExpelled from the United States, young Mexican immigrants like Garcia, 35, are documenting the aftermath of their deportation online. Their videos \u2013 raw grief over what they lost in America, surprise and gratitude for what they've found in Mexico \u2013 are rapidly gaining them tens of thousands of followers.\nAt least a dozen of these deportees-turned-influencers, Garcia included, have started over in Mexico's west coast beach gem, Puerto Vallarta.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I wish my content could embody it's how much life there is on this side of the border,\" Garcia wrote June 15 on Instagram. \"Our countries aren\u2019t what they were 20 or 30 years ago when our parents left.\"\nReturning to an unfamiliar 'home'\nMore than 70,000 Mexican nationals were deported from the United States to Mexico in the first six months of 2025, according to Mexico's Interior Ministry.\nThat's down from the more than 102,000 deported during the same six-month period in 2024, when people were being deported after crossing the border. Now, the people being deported are more likely to have built lives and families in the United States.\nWith President Donald Trump's aggressive mass deportation campaign underway, Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez-Corona feared being detained.\nSo he self-deported to Mexico, accompanied by his husband. He started vlogging. The 30-something Harvard graduate and former Dreamer had been taken to the United States illegally as a boy, he explained on TikTok. Multiple attempts to legalize his status in the United States failed.\nIn June, he posted his migration \u2013 and self-deportation \u2013 stories online.\nBetween photos of golden sunsets and mouthwatering tacos, he posted in July: \"Self-deporting isn't always freedom and joy and new adventures. Sometimes it's pain and nostalgia and anger and sadness. Sometimes you just miss the home that was.\"\n'Life in the pueblo is not easy'\nMexico remains a country of extremes, where stunning vistas and limitless wealth can be found in big cities and beach resorts, while hardship and poverty often overwhelm smaller communities.\nOlga Mijangos was deported from Las Vegas on Christmas Eve 2024, two years after being charged with a DUI. She returned to the Oaxaca state pueblo she had left when she was 5.\nMijangos, 33, has tattoos on her neck, stylized brows and long lashes \u2013 all part of her Vegas style.\nBack in her hometown, she began posting videos of goats being herded through the streets; the community rodeo; the traditional foods she began cooking. She posted videos from her first job: harvesting and cleaning cucumbers, earning 300 pesos a day, or $15.\n\"I clearly understand why my mother decided to take us when we were little. Life in the pueblo is not easy,\" she said in a video of the cucumber harvest. \"There is hard-living. There is poverty.\"\nStruggling to make ends meet for her family, including two children with her in Mexico and one in the United States, she moved to Puerto Vallarta, where she met Garcia and Hern\u00e1ndez-Corona.\nThey began forming an in-real-life community of deportees-turned-influencers and others who left the United States. They meet up for dinner at least once a month, and they create content. In their videos, they're having fun, drinks, and laughs. But they're also celebrating what binds them to each other and their parents' migration stories before them: their capacity for reinvention and their resilience.\n\"I'm very proud to be Mexican, and I'm learning to love a country I didn't get to grow up in, but I shouldn't have had to leave the home I knew to find peace and freedom,\" said Hern\u00e1ndez-Corona, a clinical psychologist, in a July post on TikTok. \"This isn't a blessing. It's resilience.\"\nSpanish skills, savings and support all matter\nA lot of their content has the draw of a classic American up-by-their-bootstraps success story, with a modern social media twist: from hardship to sponsorship.\nBut the reality is that deportees' experience of building a life in Mexico can vary dramatically, depending on their earning capacity, language and cultural skills, and other factors, said Israel Ibarra Gonz\u00e1lez, a professor of migration studies at Mexico's Colegio de la Frontera Norte university.\nDeportees with savings in U.S. dollars and a college degree, those who speak Spanish and have supportive relatives in Mexico, may have an easier time than those who don't, he said.\nOthers may face life-threatening risks upon their return, from the violence of organized crime to political persecution or death threats.\n\"However much violence they've lived with in the United States, it's not the same as going back to a war zone,\" Ibarra Gonz\u00e1lez said, referring to certain Mexican states where drug cartels are actively battling for territorial control.\nWherever they land \u2013 with the exception of some cosmopolitan cities \u2013 deported Mexicans have faced local prejudices, too. They've often been viewed as criminals, or their deportations as a failure.\n\"Did I feel a lot of judgment? Absolutely,\" Mijangos said of her return to Oaxaca. \"Even though it\u2019s my roots, I basically came from a different world. I have tattoos. I lived my life a certain way that they don\u2019t. I could feel people talking.\"\nBut friends back home in Vegas, and new friends in Mexico, started encouraging her to share her deportation journey. It took her a few weeks to work up the courage. She posted a video of sending her U.S. citizen son to a Mexican school.\nIt racked up nearly 14 million views and 2 million \"likes\" on TikTok, she said. Suddenly, TikTok was asking if she wanted to join the app's content creators' rewards program.\n'Your criminal record doesn't follow you'\nBy taking their stories online, deported content creators say they are dismantling longstanding taboos around deportation in Mexico, shining a light on their experiences as Mexicans who didn't grow up in Mexico, and on their past mistakes.\nGarcia speaks openly on her social media about the financial crimes she committed in her 20s, for which she was charged and convicted, and that ultimately led to her deportation.\nShe migrated to the United States when she was 4 years old, \"out of necessity,\" she said. Her mother married an American citizen in Salt Lake City, and she and her mother both became legal permanent residents.\nBut when Garcia began acting out as a child, the state intervened. \"I was taken from my mother at the age of 12 because I had behavioral issues,\" she told USA TODAY. \"I was separated from my family, and I grew up with other juveniles with behavior (problems).\"\nAs a young single mother, she would steal from her employers when she couldn't pay the bills, she said.\nIn Mexico, she found a clean slate. \"Your criminal record doesn't follow you,\" once you've paid your debt to society in the United States, Garcia tells her followers. \"You can pursue higher education. Any debts you had in the U.S. do not follow you here.\"\nAs Trump's immigration crackdown widens, Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo has been publicly offering moral support to Mexicans facing deportation. She has called them \"heroes and heroines\" who \"have contributed to the United States their entire lives.\"\n\"We're going to keep defending our brothers and sisters there,\" she said in a June 25 news conference.\n'Maybe \u2026 things will change'\nGarcia's social media accounts have grown so popular that she's earning a living, in part, from content creation. She is doing research on reintegration after deportation for an American university. And she has \"tunnel vision,\" she said, on completing a law degree in Mexico.\nThe pain of her deportation, and the losses it brought with it, are mostly in the past. Except when she catches news of the immigration raids in the United States.\nThe memories of her detention and her separation from her five children, including an infant, remain fresh. It took Garcia more than a year after her 2017 deportation to win custody of her children to bring them to Mexico.\n\"It\u2019s very, very triggering to me to see what\u2019s going on up there,\" she said. \"It\u2019s a bittersweet feeling. I feel safe. I feel relief. We\u2019re here. It doesn\u2019t affect us anymore. But it feels heartbreaking to see other families living through it.\n\"When I first started sharing my story, my idea was, 'Maybe if I talk about this, things will change'\" in the United States, she said.\nShe kept at it, despite facing hate and trolls online. She kept posting, even after losing two jobs in Mexico for openly discussing her deportation and criminal past on social media.\nShe kept sharing, thinking, she said: \"This is what is going to change things one day: us putting our stories out there.\""

      "text": "Judge temporarily blocks Kilmar Abrego Garcia's deportation: What to know\nA federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting Kilmar Abrego Garcia for a second time \u2013 after he was wrongfully removed to El Salvador earlier this year.\nDistrict Judge Paula Xinis of Maryland ruled from the bench on Monday, Aug. 25, that the government cannot deport Abrego Garcia until she can hold a hearing on his latest lawsuit challenging his deportation.\nXinis\u2019 order came just hours after U.S. immigration agents detained Abrego Garcia when he reported to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Baltimore for what his attorneys had been told was a mandatory check-in. Agents detained him within 60 seconds of his arrival, said his attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s detention is the latest chapter in a case that started back in March when he was stopped near his home in Maryland and deported to a Salvadoran mega-prison. The case has fueled outrage over the Trump administration\u2019s hardline deportation policies.\nAbrego Garcia has spent more than five months in detention, including time in his native El Salvador at a prison known for its harsh conditions. Last week, he was released from criminal custody in Tennessee and returned to his home in the Washington suburb of Beltsville, Maryland.\nAt the hearing on Monday, Xinis stressed that the government was \u201cabsolutely forbidden at this juncture\u201d from removing Abrego Garcia from the United States.\nThe government's attorney, Drew Ensign, said Abrego Garcia's deportation was not imminent and that it takes time to remove someone to another country. Still, the administration is adamant that he will not be allowed to remain in the United States.\n\"ICE law enforcement arrested Kilmar Abrego Garcia & are processing him for deportation,\" the White House said in a social media post. \"@POTUS is not going to allow this illegal alien, who is an MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, & child predator to terrorize American citizens...\" - @Sec_Noem.\"\nAbrego Garcia, who has repeatedly denied those claims, arrived at the ICE office Monday with his wife and brother and was quickly surrounded by a crowd of supporters chanting \"Si se puede,\" Spanish for \"Yes we can.\" He and his wife embraced in the building's lobby before proceeding through a security checkpoint.\nWhere is Abrego Garcia being held? Where could he be deported?\nSandoval-Moshenberg said his client is being held in a detention facilitiy in Virginia. U.S. officials have offered to deport him to Costa Rica if he pleads guilty to transporting migrants living illegally in the United States, his lawyers say. When he declined to enter a guilty plea, the U.S. government warned he could be deported to Uganda.\nAbrego Garcia's lawyers say they have entered plea discussions with the government to avoid deportation to Uganda, which they say would be \"far more dangerous\" than Costa Rica.\n\"They're holding Costa Rica as a carrot and using Uganda as a stick,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said. \"They're weaponizing the immigration system in a way that's completely unconstitutional.\"\n'An acceptably less bad option'\nBefore his check-in with ICE, Abrego Garcia notified the government in writing that Costa Rica would be an acceptable country for the United States to send him after he received assurances from Costa Rica that he would be given refugee status there and would not be deported back to El Salvador, Sandoval-Moshenberg said.\n\"For him to be removed to Costa Rica is not justice,\" Sandoval-Moshenberg said, \"it is an acceptably less bad option.\"\nXinis suggested during the hearing that, if Abrego Garcia is deported, federal law may require that he be sent to his country of choice, especially since Costa Rica has agreed to grant him refugee status and not send him back to El Salvador.\nAbrego Garcia also filed a second notice with the U.S. government saying he feared removal to Uganda because of human rights abuses in that country and the lack of assurances that Uganda would not send him back to El Salvador, Sandoval-Moshenberg said.\nBecause of that notice, Abrego Garcia is entitled to an interview, Sandoval-Moshenberg said, and the U.S. government cannot remove him from the country until that interview is granted.\nAbrego Garcia claims he was beaten, tortured\nAbrego Garcia was mistakenly deported and taken to the Terrorism Confinement Center, also known as CECOT, in Tecoluca, El Salvador, in March. The Trump administration has admitted in court documents that the deportation was a mistake, which it blamed it on an \u201cadministrative error.\u201d\nAbrego Garcia experienced \"severe beatings\" and \"psychological torture\" in the notorious high-security prison, his lawyers said in a court filing last month. The filing also says that Abrego Garcia experienced \"severe sleep deprivation\" and nutrition so inadequate that he lost 31 pounds.\nLawsuit filed in Maryland seeking to ban deportation\nAbrego Garcia has filed a federal lawsuit in Maryland seeking an order to ban deporting him anywhere unless he has had the chance to contest being sent there. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has blamed \u201cactivist liberal judges\u201d for blocking administration efforts to remove people living in the U.S. illegally who were suspected of committing crimes.\n\u201cBy ordering this monster loose on America\u2019s streets, this judge has shown a complete disregard for the safety of the American people,\u201d Noem said. \u201cWe will not stop fighting till this Salvadoran man faces justice and is OUT of our country.\u201d\nTrump administration has focused on Abrego Garcia\nAbrego Garcia, a sheetmetal worker living in suburban Washington, became the face of President Donald Trump's sweeping and controversial deportation tactics.\nAbrego Garcia entered the country illegally around 2012 as a teen. Immigration officials issued a final order of removal in 2019, but they said he could not be released to his home country of El Salvador because of credible fears of persecution by gangs in that country.\nContributing: Amanda Lee Myers, USA TODAY; Reuters"

      "text": "ICE detention is growing in the South. This state was the first.\nLouisiana, long known for its 'prison economy,' now houses more ICE detention facilities than any other non-border state.\nWINN PARISH, LA \u2013 Far from the jazz clubs and nightlife of New Orleans, thousands await their fate inside immigration jails.\nLouisiana has more dedicated Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers than any other state besides Texas \u2013 nine total \u2013 after it converted nearly half a dozen correctional facilities to immigrant detention. Most are remote, scattered near farms and forests. Among the sites is a unique \"staging facility\" on a rural airport tarmac for rapid deportations.\nPresident Donald Trump is increasingly leaning on Republican-led Southern states to detain and deport millions of immigrants \u2012 from \"Alligator Alcatraz\" in the Florida Everglades to the expansion of a sprawling Georgia immigration facility. Far from the U.S.-Mexico border, Mississippi has the ICE jail with the highest average daily population.\nBut Louisiana was the first non-border state to surge immigration detention capacity, according to the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana and Tulane University Law School. The state opened five new facilities to detain immigrants in 2019, during the first Trump administration, and vastly expanded the number of detainees during the Biden administration.\nImmigrants are sent here from all over the country, far from their families, communities and, often, their lawyers.\nThe Trump administration has confined some of its highest-profile detainees in Louisiana, including now-released Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil and Harvard University scientist Kseniia Petrova.\nThe state's largest immigration jail, Winn Correctional Center, is tucked deep into dense pine woods nearly five hours northwest of New Orleans. The site is so remote that, for years, online maps routinely sent visitors the wrong way down a dirt road. A warning sign cautions visitors: \"This property is utilized for the training of chase dogs.\"\nOther states might follow Louisiana's example as more federal funds flow to ICE detention. Congress recently authorized the Trump administration to spend $45 billion over the next four years to expand immigration jails around the country. That's nearly four times ICE's previous annual detention budget.\nUSA TODAY traveled to four of Louisiana's nine ICE facilities, hoping to see firsthand what life is like for immigrants detained there. But the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement denied multiple requests for a tour of any of the locations.\nIn an emailed statement, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said ICE originally expanded its detention capacity in Louisiana \"to address the increasing number of individuals apprehended at the border\" under the Biden administration.\n\"ICE continues to explore all options to meet its current and future detention requirements while removing detainees as quickly as possible from the U.S.,\" she said.\nNora Ahmed, legal director of the ACLU of Louisiana, described the state as key to Trump's promised mass deportation campaign.\n\"Louisiana really is the epicenter for a lot of what is currently taking place with this administration,\" Ahmed said. \"It's an outcropping of a prison economy that Louisiana has survived on for a long, long time.\"\nDeportation hub far from the border\nLouisiana found its foothold as a deportation hub at the end of Trump's first term, when the administration was looking to expand immigrant detention.\nThe state had reformed its criminal justice system in 2017, with bipartisan support, to reduce sentences for low-level offenders. That had the effect of dramatically decreasing the state's prison population and freeing thousands of incarcerated people \u2013 mainly Black men and women.\nAt the time, the Black imprisonment rate was nearly four times the rate of White imprisonment in Louisiana, according to the ACLU.\nLouisiana eventually rolled back the reforms. But racial justice activists briefly celebrated a win.\nThen ICE came knocking.\nThe first Trump administration, and later the Biden administration, wanted to detain more illegal border crossers. Louisiana offered advantages: empty prisons, employees already trained in corrections, and access to the Alexandria airport with a detention facility and a history of deportation flights.\nIt also has some of the country's most conservative immigration judges, as well as a federal appeals court that, in immigration cases, often sides with the government, lawyers say.\n\"Louisiana had the infrastructure already there,\" said Homero L\u00f3pez, legal director of New Orleans-based Immigration Services and Legal Advocacy, a nonprofit that provides free representation. \"ICE comes in saying, \u2018Y\u2019all have got the space. We\u2019ve got the people. We\u2019ll pay you double what the state was paying.\u2019 That\u2019s why the expansion was so fast.\"\nLouisiana's rural communities offered advantages for ICE\nMany Americans know Louisiana by its crown jewel, New Orleans, the state's tourism mecca, where social norms and politics are as liberal as the flow of alcohol on Bourbon Street.\nBut Louisiana is largely wooded, rural, proudly conservative and deeply Christian. County governments are called parishes and the poverty rate is the highest in the nation.\n\"People want jobs and who\u2019s to blame them?\" said Austin Kocher, a Syracuse University research assistant professor who studies immigration enforcement. \"It\u2019s fairly easy to promise jobs by setting up a detention facility.\"\nRural Louisiana used to make a living from oil and timber. Logging trucks still rumble down forested two-lane roads, but the decline in natural resources and price unpredictability drove some communities to look for new industries.\nPrisons and now immigration detention deliver good-paying jobs and economic development to places like Winn, Ouachita and LaSalle parishes.\nLaSalle was one of the first to see the potential. In 2007, local leaders in the parish seat of Jena \u2013 current population 4,155 \u2013 wanted to diversify the economy. A sprawling juvenile detention facility north of town sat empty.\nWhen GEO Group, the nation's largest private detention contractor, swooped in with an ICE contract in hand, local leaders welcomed the opportunity.\n\"Not having to build an entirely new facility was probably a key factor to them locating here,\" said Craig Franklin, editor of the weekly Jena Times. Plus, \"our advantage to a strong employee pool was likely a factor.\"\nIn Ouachita Parish, the mayor and council of Richwood \u2012 population 3,881 \u2012 debated whether to approve an ICE detention contract. Mayor Gerald Brown didn't have a vote, but he supported the conversion to ICE detention, he said.\n\"Richwood Correctional Center is one of our biggest employers,\" Brown told USA TODAY. \"There was a lot of back and forth. We did town halls, and we had meetings.\"\nThe town stood to gain new income as an intermediary between ICE and the private operator, LaSalle Corrections. When it was a jail, the town earned a $112,000 a year fee. Now that it's an ICE detention center, the town is getting about $412,000 a year.\n\"The financial windfall for the community was something I certainly couldn't turn a blind eye to,\" Brown said.\nRemote ICE detention has consequences for the detained\nThe willingness of rural communities to house ICE facilities is part of the draw to Louisiana, researchers who study immigration detention say.\nAnother factor: When ICE tries to open new detention centers near big cities, the agency is often met with resistance from immigrant rights activists and residents with \"not in my backyard\" arguments.\nBut attorneys say the rural locations have real consequences for the people detained.\nData shows that having access to an attorney dramatically improves a detainee's chance of winning release and a chance at staying in the United States. But it's hard for attorneys to get to many of the facilities; Ahmed regularly drives three to seven hours to visit immigrant clients across the state.\nBaher Azmy, legal director of the New York-based Center of Constitutional Rights, represented Khalil, the Columbia University activist, during his more than three-month detention at the Central Louisiana Processing Center in Jena.\nHe visited twice and said he was struck by its remoteness, the utter lack of space for attorneys to meet their clients and the no-contact family visitation conducted behind plexiglass.\nAccommodations were made for Khalil to see his wife and newborn baby in a separate room, after a court ordered it.\n\"Getting there was an all-day proposition,\" Azmy said. \"It reminded me of my early trips to Guantanamo,\" the military jail on the island of Cuba, where he represented clients accused of terrorism in the years after the 9/11 attacks. \"The desolation, the difficulty getting there. The visiting conditions were better in Guantanamo than in Jena. As horrible as Guantanamo was, I could hug my client.\"\nAccording to ICE, rules and accommodations at different facilities can depend on their design and capacity, as well as contractual agreements.\n\"Allegations that ICE detention facilities have improper conditions are unequivocally false and designed to demonize ICE law enforcement,\" McLaughlin said. \"ICE follows national detention standards.\"\nExponential expansion of ICE detention\nThe United States has consistently grown its immigration detention through both Republican and Democratic administrations.\nBut the average number of immigrants in detention on any given day has risen rapidly over the past six months, from roughly 40,000 people at the end of the Biden administration in January to more than 58,000 in early July.\nUnder President Joe Biden, ICE moved thousands of migrants who sought asylum at the United States-Mexico border over to Louisiana detention centers, said the ACLU's Ahmed.\nNow, the centers are filled with people picked up in the country's interior.\nNearly half of those in ICE detention in early July had no criminal record or pending charges, according to ICE data. They faced civil immigration violations.\nWhen determining whether to send a detainee to Louisiana, ICE considers bed space availability, the detainee's medical and security needs and proximity to transportation, according to an agency statement.\nThe average daily population in Louisiana ICE facilities topped 7,300 in early July. That compares to roughly 2,000 ICE detainees in 2017 at the start of the first Trump administration, according to data collected by TRAC at Syracuse University.\nSome of that increase is due to a Trump administration decision to withdraw legal status from thousands of immigrants who arrived during the Biden administration and followed the rules then in place.\n\"These are mothers. These are children. These are students. And these are individuals who often had status that was very much legal, that's then been taken away by the administration,\" Ahmed said. \"So what we are seeing is the rendering of documented people to undocumented by the stroke of a pen of the United States government.\"\nThree times this spring and early summer, Will Trim traveled to Richwood Correctional to visit his colleague Petrova, the Harvard scientist from Russia. He said the buildings looked \"like warehouses, featureless beige buildings\" encircled with razor wire, separated from a low-income neighborhood by a patch of woods.\nDuring his visits, few of the people he spoke with in the nearby town of Monroe knew that more than 700 immigrant women were being held locally. According to ICE data, on average, in July, 97% of the women in Richwood Correctional had no criminal record.\n\"If they are being held without charge,\" he asked, \"why is there double-barbed wire? Why is it hidden in the forest?\"\nLauren Villagran can be reached at lvillagran@usatoday.com.\nDinah Pulver and Ignacio Calderon contributed to this report."

  "argos_summary": "The article reports that under President Trump, ICE has intensified its enforcement campaign with record funding and aggressive arrest quotas, leading to staff burnout, long hours, and public backlash over detentions of non\u2011criminals and legal visa holders. ICE is recruiting thousands of new agents to meet a target of 3,000 daily arrests, while reassignment of specialist investigators to routine enforcement has strained resources. The crackdown has sparked widespread criticism from local communities, lawmakers, and civil\u2011rights groups, and has raised concerns about the impact on immigrant workers and the broader economy.",
