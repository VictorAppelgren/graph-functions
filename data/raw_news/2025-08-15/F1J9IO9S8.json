  "content": "Brandi Glanville Credits Her Children For Being Alive\n\nThe Bravo alum suddenly found herself contemplating life sometimes this summer and may have taken up that offer to leave if not for her kids. Glanville is mom to her two sons, whom she shares with her former husband, Eddie Cibrian.\n\nThe former reality star's nightmare began when she put the controversial aftermath of her Morocco girls' trip behind her and suddenly woke up with a swollen face. She recalled that everything seemed like a blur at first, then her face started alternating between swelling and sinking in.\n\n\"I felt like something was just eating me from the inside. I'm like, 'It's eating my flesh,'\" Glanville said. Since then, it has been from one symptom to another and incessant trips to the doctors, which have drained her insurance and wallet.\n\nInside The Mother-Of-Two's Hunt For The Perfect Medical Fix\n\nThe former reality star added that her symptoms have seemed to worsen as time ticks on her getting a solution. She explained that the lump in her face moves to either position at will and extends to the rest of her body, obstructing normal function.\n\nThe Former Bravo Star Reminisced On Her Life Before Her Medical Issues\n\nComparison is a thief of joy, but Glanville did it anyway as she reflected on what it truly felt like missing out on life and the fun times, as she grappled with the swelling and pain. According to her, things almost looked similar to life during COVID-19, with the crazy side effects as a cherry on top.\n\nThe TV star declared that she missed getting intimate with men and socializing with her friends, emphasizing that the former, which was almost regular, has now become a luxury. Glanville confessed that she has lost her sensual touch and may have to learn how to kiss again.\n\nThe media personality also has to deal with the insecurity of her new appearance, which comes with severe anxiety and pain. Glanville stated that she felt like she had lost her old self to the reality of her sickness.\n\nThe 'RHOBH' Star Found A Glimpse Of Hope With New Treatment\n\nShe praised Dr. Michael R. Scoma for wanting to help her get better and making her return to the old Glanville a possible feat. PEOPLE reported that she traced the genesis of her health problems to the food consumed during the trip to Morocco.\n\nThe star shared that the food, mostly meat, was left open for hours outside with flies crawling all over them. Now that Scoma is attending to her case, the former Bravo Star cannot wait to get out of the house and \"live again.\"\n\nThe medical practitioner gave further insights into how they have gone in treating Glanville's condition via a response to her post on X. He explained that while care for infectious diseases is an intensive one behind the scenes, it is also a personal journey.\n\nBrandi Glanville Revealed How Accusations From Her Former Castmate Ruined Her Career",

      "text": "Brandi Glanville Revisits Bravo Feud By Christening Her Facial Parasite\nBy Afouda Bamidele on August 5, 2025 at 1:30 PM EDT\nBrandi Glanville just gave her face parasite a name and, in true \"Real Housewives\" fashion, it is petty!\nThe reality star revealed she dubbed the unwelcome intruder \"Caroline,\" a not-so-subtle jab at her longtime rival Caroline Manzo.\nBrandi Glanville's return to the spotlight follows a rough chapter in her career, one that began when rumors swirled that she crossed the line with Manzo during filming, leading to the early exit that sent her into a troubled spiral.\nBrandi Glanville Burns Face With Nair Trying To Evict Her Facial Parasite\nGlanville is taking beauty DIY to a whole new and dangerous level. She shocked fans after sharing a graphic TikTok update on her ongoing battle with a facial parasite, which she nicknamed \"Caroline\" after longtime enemy Caroline Manzo.\nIn the video, Glanville revealed she used Nair, a hair-removal cream, as a way to exfoliate her skin and annoy the parasite she claims is living in her face. With a deadpan expression, she noted, \"When I have an exfoliated face, it pisses Caroline off, whoever's living in my face.\"\nThe unconventional method backfired, leaving her with visible burns and damaged skin. \"She's moved from here to up there,\" Glanville explained, referencing \"Caroline,\" while zooming in on her cheekbone and forehead.\nIn her caption, she shared a DIY treatment to ease the pain: \"Mix up some aloe Vera, cucumber, and black tea. Put it in the freezer. Put it in the spray bottle and once it's cold enough, spray all day.\"\nThe TV Personality Says 'Housewives' Scandal Ruined Her Life\nBased on her recent TikTok video, Glanville is not done unpacking the emotional fallout from her time on \"The Real Housewives: Ultimate Girls Trip.\" It is worth noting that in April, she made it clear that the off-camera damage runs deeper than viewers might think.\nIn a revealing interview, Glanville opened up about hitting rock bottom after being sent home from Morocco while filming the now-shelved fourth season of the Bravo spinoff.\nThe Blast noted that Glanville said her world crumbled when reports surfaced claiming she behaved inappropriately toward fellow castmate Caroline Manzo, an accusation she flat-out denies.\n\"It's ruined my life. Those [first] six months, I was in a fetal position on my couch, like, contemplating suicide [and I was] being called horrible things,\" she said bluntly.\nShe also revealed that the backlash cost her more than just her Bravo gig. \"All my jobs were canceled,\" Glanville said, adding that the narrative around her exit moved so fast she did not even get a chance to defend herself before doors started slamming shut.\nThe 'Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills' Alum Says Illness Has Drained Her Finances\nView this post on Instagram\nTo make matters worse, as she lost her financial footing, she began to deal with a lingering illness that has not let up. Glanville revealed that she is still battling a mystery illness that has cost her more than just peace of mind.\nThe Blast highlighted Glanville's emotional confession that she is now financially wiped out, having spent more than $113,000 out-of-pocket on treatment after hitting a wall with her insurance plan.\n\"I'm out of funds. I'm out over six figures at this point. I don't have the means to go anywhere at this point. I'm online every day, going down a different rabbit hole. It's exhausting. It's all-consuming,\" she shared.\nThe Reality TV Star Says Parasite Has Robbed Her Of Sex, Confidence, And Herself\nThe mysterious parasite has not just drained her bank account; it has also stolen the parts of life she enjoys most. Mourning the version of herself she once knew, Glanville noted that her current life was as isolated as during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe 52-year-old admitted bluntly, \"I miss socializing with my girlfriends and then having sex with men. I'm a Scorpio. I love sex. So, I was having a lot of it, and now I haven't had any of it, and I'm like, 'Have I forgotten how to kiss?'\"\nKnown for her outspoken and unfiltered takes, she did not stop there. Glanville confessed that the ongoing health battle has chipped away at her once-solid sense of self.\n\"I've lost myself,\" she said. \"I feel more insecure than I ever have in my life. I don't get anxiety about most things. Some things do give me anxiety, don't get me wrong, but I feel like I lost Brandi.\"\nBrandi Glanville's Mysterious Parasite Gets Traced To Morocco Trip\nAfter years of confusion and pain, Glanville may finally have some answers, and she is not alone in her misery. Last month, The Blast reported that fellow Bravo star Vicki Gunvalson believes she contracted the same parasite that has been wreaking havoc on Glanville's life.\nThe \"Real Housewives of Orange County\" alum said the symptoms began after the pair's 2023 trip to Morocco for \"Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip.\"\nGunvalson did not mince words. She described the environment as less than sanitary and shared that Glanville's condition is severe, with the parasite moving to different parts of her body and causing intense discomfort. And it has not been easy for Gunvalson either.\nMedical tests confirmed parasites had overrun her gut, and while both women are still not out of the woods, the likely source of their health nightmare has finally been pinpointed.\nClearly, the Housewives drama is not a thing of the past for Brandi Glanville."

She had just won over audiences again on The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip: Ex-Wives Club and season 1 of The Traitors, but things took a turn when she was accused of sexual misconduct by RHUGT costar Caroline Manzo. (In court documents related to the incident, an executive producer stated that Manzo felt \u201cdisrespected\u201d by Glanville but claimed Glanville did not \u201csexually violate\u201d Manzo.)\nWhen she returned home from Morocco, Glanville slipped into a depression about the controversy and subsequently discovered she had contracted a parasite while filming.\n\u201cAlmost immediately upon landing, my phone started blowing up about these articles that were incorrect and not true about what happened in Morocco with Caroline, and I immediately took on a ton of anxiety,\u201d she tells Us. \u201cAnd I was just trying to get my head around what was happening and why it was happening. I was on the couch in a fetal position for four months.\u201d\nWhen Glanville attempted to socialize again, she started noticing \u201ccrazy lumps\u201d in her face.\n\u201cMy face started, like, moving around and doing things. I started to lose my eyesight in my left eye. It\u2019s insane,\u201d she says. \u201cAt first, my face was blowing up and getting really swollen. Then it started sinking in, and I felt like something was just eating me from the inside. I\u2019m like, \u2018It\u2019s eating my flesh.\u2019\u201d\nGlanville\u2019s most extreme symptoms over the last two years also include gray spots on her \u201csunken-in\u201d face, fluid that comes out of her left ear or drains into her mouth and extreme headaches.\nGlanville has seen 21 doctors, paying for several out of pocket when she couldn\u2019t get answers from providers within her insurance. \u201cThey didn\u2019t believe me,\u201d she says. \u201cMy insurance was like, \u2018Nothing\u2019s wrong with you. It\u2019s just inflammation and old filler.\u2019\u201d\nGlanville has spent at least $130,000 on medical bills and is struggling financially.\n\u201cI\u2019m paying the minimum on my credit cards. I\u2019ve exhausted my savings. At my age, I feel like such a loser in a way, because I was taking care of everything,\u201d she says. \u201cI was together. I had great credit. Now I\u2019m scared about every little thing.\u201d\nAcknowledging that \u201cmedical bills are the No. 1 cause of bankruptcy,\u201d Glanville has started working with Rachel Strauss, a healthcare strategist, known as the PBM Princess.\n\u201cWhere it does fall on her responsibility is working with the hospitals she saw to review what was billed and making sure it was billed properly. There are certain things that were truly emergencies that doctors will validate, and [we can get] those reduced however we can,\u201d Strauss tells Us. \u201cOnce we negotiate the service fees, we\u2019ll work on a payment plan so that Brandi can live and have a roof over her head and be able to have food and everything that you need to sustain.\u201d\nDespite the financial strain caused by all the appointments, Strauss notes that it\u2019s important Glanville advocated for herself when she believed the doctors within her insurance plan weren\u2019t listening to her.\n\u201cNow that she has a definitive diagnosis, she\u2019s able to go back, and that\u2019s where she can start advocating financially,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was something wrong, and that\u2019s where we have to go back and make sure that insurance understands that, because that is why she went out of network.\u201d\nGlanville has also started new treatments with Dr. Michael R. Scoma, an infectious disease specialist who reached out to her via X. One day before her visit with Us, she began Dr. Scoma\u2019s multiphase treatment plan, which kicks off with several weeks of intravenous antibiotics via a PICC line to treat her longstanding infection and its secondary effects.\n\u201cWe can expect to see meaningful progress within the next few weeks,\u201d Dr. Scoma tells Us. \u201cAnd I do believe Brandi can make a full recovery.\u201d\nCalling herself a \u201chopeful wreck,\u201d Glanville says she wants to get her life back.\n\u201cI was sleeping until 5 p.m. I couldn\u2019t get out of bed. Everything ached \u2014 at one point, I couldn\u2019t move my neck. I couldn\u2019t get out of bed for four hours. And I\u2019m just like, \u2018This is not an existence,\u2019\u201d she tells Us. \u201cI stay in this house every day. I\u2019m paying crazy amounts of rent. I\u2019m worrying about money all day long. I have brain fog. I get one thing done a day, and I\u2019m just frazzled.\u201d\nJust last week, when she hit a low, she called her mom for support.\n\u201cI go, \u2018Mom, I know you have Grandma. I know you have Dad. I know you have your plate full, but I need you to come,\u2019\u201d Glanville recalls. \u201cAnd so she, like, dropped everything and came for a couple days. I colored her hair, and we had girl time.\u201d\nThat pampering also included the now-viral clip of Glanville putting Nair on her face.\n\u201cI was just going down every rabbit hole, and my face loved exfoliation. It was like, \u2018OK, I\u2019m gonna get whatever this is out.\u2019 So I would exfoliate, like, five times a day, and I wouldn\u2019t even put moisturizer on and it was back to oily \u2014 and I never had oily skin,\u201d she tells Us. \u201cIf Nair dissolves hair, maybe, it\u2019ll dissolve whatever\u2019s in my skin. And my mom\u2019s like, \u2018You do your Brandi.\u2019 Like, when I was little, I used Comet on my teeth because I wanted white teeth. That\u2019s just my idea. I\u2019m a do-it-yourselfer. It doesn\u2019t always work out. But honestly, she put tea bags on my skin after to make it, like, cool down, and they were brown, and so it looked like my face was scorched when really it was just a little bit pink.\u201d\nFollowing treatments from Dr. Scoma, however, Glanville hopes to be back to \u201cdancing on tables and [drinking] sake.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I just want to leave my house,\u201d she says again. \u201cI\u2019m in Groundhog Day.\u201d\nIf you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available.

She went public with the health issue in 2023, revealing it had caused significant changes to her face.\nBrandi Glanville previously blamed her face disfigurement on Bravo, claiming her issues with the network had taken a toll on her health.
