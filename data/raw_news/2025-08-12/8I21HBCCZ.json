  "title": "MTG: Spider-Man Continues A Fantastical Collectors Dream",
  "description": "Spider-Man and the extended Spider-Man multiverse is set to join Magic: The Gathering as its latest Universes Beyond expansion set.",
  "content": "MTG: Spider-Man is the next Universes Beyond set, releasing later this year. But it started with a bunch of Secret Lair drops in 2020. The Walking Dead, Stranger Things, Street Fighter, and Fortnite were some of the early Universes Beyond releases from Hasbro\u2019s Magic: The Gathering brand. These cards, some reskins, were terribly popular with collectors, chasing the pop culture crossover dream. While the resell value of most of these drops has stayed steady, it was the Warhammer 40,000 Commander decks in 2022 that really pushed Universes Beyond into the forefront of comic book store shelves.\n\nThese Commander sets go for hundreds of dollars, according to a quick search on TCGPlayer. And that resell value has renewed heated interest into a brand that for a while, was meeting a tad of (anecdotal) stagnation in the market. Wizards of the Coast realized they had something going with these crossovers, leading up to next month\u2019s full release of Spider-Man (after a Marvel Secret Lair drop last year).\n\nNot all releases have seen a full release in the sense of booster packs, Commander decks, and all the other selling packs. Notably, The Lord of The Rings, Assassin\u2019s Creed, and Fallout have found their way into the hands of collectors, with plenty of new cards and a few reskins mixed in. Final Fantasy came out earlier this year, and collectors were chasing that Traveling Chocobo card for sure. And if you were able to get your hands on a Collector\u2019s Booster, you can pay your rent selling a couple of those. So will Spider-Man reach the same level of ridiculous value?\n\nProbably. Because there is an Infinity Stone. You thought The One Ring was cool? Wait until you pull a cosmic foil Soul Stone. If you are lucky, maybe Post Malone will buy it off you.\n\nOne of the best things about these Universes Beyond releases, besides the resell value, is the artwork. With Spider-Man, we\u2019re going to see Showcase Scene cards. These cards can be combined to form a scene that feels like it was lifted from a comic book. Spider-Man comic cover artists such as Steve Ditko will be featured on cards starring iconic Spider-Man characters. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the cards you\u2019ll likely be slipping into card protectors in a few weeks.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that you are going to find a lot of double-sided cards in this expansion. Not my favorite to play with because you have to remove them from the sleeves to transform them. That\u2019s a personal issue though. But the mythic cards should carry a moderate resale value at least.\n\nThis set is leaning heavily into the multiverse aspect, with characters that found their way from the comics to the big screen along with Miles Morales in Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. It\u2019s clear this set isn\u2019t settling on the traditional universe populated by Tobey Maguire and his new best friends Tom Holland and Andrew Garfield. It\u2019s all the Spider-Mans from all the places. And their best villains and abilities. Plus, some great lands. Collectors love unique lands, and our first taste with Multiversal Passage certainly fits the bill.\n\nThe Magic: The Gathering Spider-Man expansion releases on September 26th, 2025 and there will surely be a ton of local comic store events leading up to the release. The pre-release parties are where you get the good stuff, especially those collector boosters before everyone else snaps them all up.",
