  "title": "How this 96-year-old\u2019s garden grew into a food bank feeding thousands in Florida",
  "description": "Bill Brown, 96, has no plans to slow down his efforts to fight hunger in his community. He founded the Children\u2019s Table three decades ago, and his food bank has become a volunteer movement in North Central Florida, one that started out of a single garden.",
  "content": "At 96 years old, Bill Brown has lived through everything from World War II to the Civil Rights movement to the rise of the internet. But of all the history he\u2019s seen, Brown says it was the Great Depression that might have had the most profound impact on his life.\n\n\u201cPeople came to help me and my mother and father during the depression, and I always felt I had a debt to pay,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAs a little boy I learned how to help people.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a lesson that has stuck with him. For the last 30 years, Brown \u2013 or Mr. Bill, as everyone calls him \u2013 has dedicated his life to helping others through the nonprofit he founded, the Children\u2019s Table. The small, community food bank in North Central Florida has served thousands of families over the years.\n\nIn June, the organization estimated to have already served more than 1.5 million meals this year alone.\n\n\u201cI think people in this community without Mr. Bill and the Children\u2019s Table would be hungry,\u201d said Stacey Kile, the organization\u2019s operations manager.\n\nProviding much more than food\n\nBrown, a US military veteran, started the organization with his wife, Verna, in Levy County, and they have since expanded their outreach to now serve around 10 counties. These are counties with high poverty rates, little to no public transportation, and many areas that could be considered \u201cfood deserts.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a convenience store on the corner that\u2019s got soda and potato chips, but not healthy options for your family to live off of,\u201d Kile said.\n\nIn these areas the Children\u2019s Table is a lifeline, not only to fresh food but to help families make ends meet. The food bank holds weekly distributions every Monday at its headquarters in Bronson. They ask for a suggested $10 donation, and in return customers receive about $100 to $150 in groceries. The donations are what keep the organization running because, Kile said, they don\u2019t rely on outside funding. But no one is ever turned away if they can\u2019t pay, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to fill your car with just as much food if you\u2019re able to give me a $10 donation or if you don\u2019t have it.\u201d\n\nEach week, around 200 cars pass through to pick up food. Some begin arriving more than an hour before the distribution starts, and the line can stretch half a mile down the road.\n\nCheryl Twombly, of the Florida Department of Children and Families, has known Brown and his wife for more than 30 years and says even families receiving public assistance need some extra help.\n\n\u201cWhen the Children\u2019s Table began, they filled a niche that didn\u2019t exist out here to serve families in these communities,\u201d Twombly said. \u201cThere was no place where people could go to get emergency food.\u201d\n\nThe Children\u2019s Table eventually became a movement in the community, one that grew out of a single garden.\n\nThe Browns have lived in Bronson for about 35 years. When Bill was in his 60s, he helped tend a vegetable garden at their home. Whenever they had an abundance of produce, they would give any leftover vegetables to nearby families in need.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t plan on starting the Children\u2019s Table, it just reached the point that we were serving so many people that I thought it had to have an identity and a name,\u201d Brown said.\n\nAs they began serving more communities, the group started incorporating more ways to reach people in remote areas. A big part of their work now includes a bus delivery route that gives people in some of the most rural parts of Florida a chance to access groceries without having to travel to the food bank. They\u2019ll even do the occasional emergency house call.\n\n\u201cThrough the years, a family would call late in the evening to say, \u2018I\u2019ve got no way to feed my family,\u2019 and they have gone, loaded up boxes of food, and driven it however far they needed to make sure that family has food,\u201d Twombly said.\n\n\u2018Too busy to lay down and die\u2019\n\nNow nearing 100, Brown doesn\u2019t plan to slow down soon. He believes the future of the Children\u2019s Table is in good hands because the community has rallied to help the cause. There\u2019s a small staff, but the organization relies heavily on volunteers, some of whom first heard about the organization by coming to pick up food themselves.\n\nWhen Deborah Gooden and her family moved to the Bronson area four years ago, she found the Children\u2019s Table out of necessity.\n\n\u201cWe had made the move to the country, and we were in desperate need of food. And this was a great resource,\u201d Gooden says. \u201cMr. Bill, he\u2019s a ray of sunshine in the darkness.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s now been volunteering with the Children\u2019s Table for four years and has started bringing some of her children along to help. She wants her kids to share Brown\u2019s lifelong belief that neighbors should help neighbors.\n\n\u201cHelping is contagious,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI\u2019m privileged when I can help someone.\u201d",
