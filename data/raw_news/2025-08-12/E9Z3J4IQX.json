  "content": "Bellway said it is well-placed to grow its volume output and increase cash generation for shareholder returns in fiscal 2026 after a good start to the year on the back of a solid performance for fiscal 2025.\n\nThe London-listed house builder on Tuesday said housing revenue for the year ended July 31 rose 17% to more than 2.76 billion pounds ($3.71 billion), in line with its previous guidance, with its operating margin expected to near 11%, up from 10%.\n\nDue to growth in private output, housing completions increased 14% to 8,749 homes at an overall average selling price of around 316,000 pounds, it added.\n\nGood volume output growth and an improvement in its underlying margin should drive a strong rise in fiscal 2025 profits, it said.\n\nThe group's forward order book at the end of the period stood at 5,307 homes, compared with 5,759 homes at June 1 and 5,144 a year prior, given the high level of private reservations during the year.\n\n\"We have entered the new financial year with a healthy forward order book and outlet opening program and, if market conditions remain stable, we are well-positioned to deliver further growth in FY26,\" Chief Executive Jason Honeyman said. Bellway plans to grow its volume output to around 9,200 homes in the new fiscal year and expects to maintain broadly flat average outlet numbers.\n\nThe group will give an update on its capital allocation framework and targets when it publishes its fiscal 2025 results on Oct. 14.",
