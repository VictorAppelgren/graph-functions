  "title": "Pope Leo signals continuation of Pope Francis' welcoming of LGBT community in Catholic Church",
  "description": "Fr. James Martin said Pope Leo XIV will continue Pope Francis's approach of openness and welcoming toward LGBTQ Catholics after their meeting.",
  "content": "Pope Leo appears to be continuing his predecessor's more welcoming posture toward the LGBTQ community, according to a Jesuit priest and proponent of a more inclusive Catholic Church who met with the pontiff this week.\n\n\"I heard the same message from Pope Leo that I heard from Pope Francis, which is the desire to welcome all people, including LGBTQ people,\" Fr. James Martin following the Monday meeting.\n\n\"It was wonderful. It was very consoling and very encouraging and, frankly, a lot of fun,\" Martin added.\n\nThe Jesuit priest, who hosts \"The Spiritual Life\" podcast and is founder of Outreach, an LGBTQ Catholic ministry, met with the late Pope Francis on several occasions.\n\nThe Catholic Church teaches that being gay is not inherently sinful, but any sexual act outside of marriage between a man and a woman is a sin. Some conservatives who were critical of Pope Francis' overtures reacted negatively to Pope Leo's meeting with Martin, while others praised it as a welcome development, the AP reported.\n\nMartin spoke highly of his meeting with Pope Leo on X.\n\n\"Dear friends: I was profoundly grateful for my audience at the Apostolic Palace with the Holy Father @Pontifex this morning,\" Martin said. \"The message I received was that Pope Leo will be continuing with the same openness that Francis showed to LGBTQ Catholics. I found Leo to be joyful, relaxed and serene. He is a joy to be with!\"\n\nPOPE MAKES PLEA FOR PEACE WITH UKRAINE IN CALL WITH PUTIN\n\nIn a post on his Outreach website , Martin said the meeting lasted about 30 minutes and remarked Pope Leo\u2019s \"approach to LGBTQ Catholic ministry\" is similar to that of Pope Francis, who reportedly told a gay man in 2018, \"God made you that way and loves you as you are, and I don\u2019t mind.\"\n\n\"The message I received from him, loud and clear, was that he wanted to continue with the same approach that Pope Francis had advanced, which was one of openness and welcome,\" Martin wrote. \"So, it was very much a hopeful message of continuity.\"\n\nMartin did acknowledge that LGBTQ issues might not be the highest priority for the Holy Father given current events, such as the wars raging in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\n\"So while LGBTQ issues are on his radar, other things may be more pressing for the time being,\" Martin said. \"And even when addressing LGBTQ issues, he may not move as fast as some might like. By the same token, he may move far too fast for others.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn 2023, before he was Pope Leo and was still Cardinal Robert Prevost, the future pontiff said the church was looking to be more welcoming. After he was elected pope, comments he made in 2012 criticizing the \"homosexual lifestyle\" resurfaced in media reports.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to a representative of The Vatican for comment.",

      "text": "Pope Leo XIV has made a direct plea for peace with Ukraine to Russian President Vladimir Putin in their first call since the American pontiff took up the highest seat in the Catholic Church last month.\nFollowing the call on Wednesday, the Vatican said the pope emphasized the \"importance of dialogue\" though it is unclear if he encouraged Putin to engage in direct discussions with his Ukrainian counterpart, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which the Kremlin chief has so far refused to do.\nWhile the pair also discussed humanitarian issues, prisoner exchanges and aid, Putin also apparently accused Kyiv of \"escalating\" the war during the phone call.\nUKRAINE TARGETS BRIDGE LINKING RUSSIA TO CRIMEA WITH MASSIVE UNDERWATER BLAST, VIDEO SHOWS\nPutin apparently told the pope \"that the Kyiv regime is banking on escalating the conflict and is carrying out sabotage against civilian infrastructure sites on Russian territory.\"\nThe claim was in reference to a recent attack on the Kerch Bridge this week, which links Crimea, the Ukrainian territory illegally annexed by Moscow in 2014, and Russia.\nThe attack came after a massive drone operation targeted Russia\u2019s military complex and destroyed dozens of warplanes capable of deploying cruise missiles.\nRUSSIA DRONE STRIKE KILLS 5 IN UKRAINE AFTER PUTIN PROMISED RETALIATION IN TRUMP CALL\nThe attack reportedly prompted Putin to question the value of peace talks, though the Kremlin has already been accused of failing to participate in ceasefire attempts in good faith as it continues to pound Ukrainian cities with drone and missile strikes.\nIn a readout of the call, the Kremlin also apparently called on the Vatican to \"take a more active role\" in advocating for religious freedoms in Ukraine when it comes to members of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which has historic links to Russia.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nCriminal proceedings have been levied by Ukrainian authorities against clergy members over suspected sympathies for Moscow.\nUkraine\u2019s foreign ministry in April also accused Russia of religious oppression in occupied territories, where hundreds of churches have been destroyed, and some 67 clergy members killed since the start of the war."

      "text": "Pope Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was the 266th pope of the Roman Catholic Church.\nHis papacy ended when he died on April 21, 2025.\nThe worldwide spiritual leader of Catholics was elected by the College of Cardinals in 2013. Before being installed as pope, Bergoglio joined the novitiate of the Society of Jesus in 1958 and was ordained a priest in 1969. He was previously the superior of the Jesuit province of Argentina and Uruguay, the auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires, and was elevated to the College of Cardinals in 2001. Bergoglio was elected pope at 78 years old.\nDuring his papacy, Bergoglio took a strong stance on social issues and controversial topics, including warnings regarding climate change and showing support to Catholics in the LGBTQ community.\nThe head of the Holy See experienced a number of health battles, even in his youth. At 21 years old, a case of pneumonia led to the partial removal of his right lung. In 2021 and 2023, Pope Francis underwent heart surgeries. Additionally, beginning in 2022, the pope\u2019s mobility has been limited due to knee issues. He has since remained mobile by using a wheelchair.\nIn February 2025, Pope Francis was admitted to Gemelli Hospital for bronchitis. It was later revealed by the Vatican that he was diagnosed with bilateral pneumonia, a condition affecting both lungs.\nPope Francis died at 88 years old when he suffered a stroke, followed by a coma. He then went into irreversible cardiocirculatory collapse and passed."

      "text": "Pope Leo XIV, born Robert Francis Prevost, was elected as 267th pontiff on May 8, 2025, after the College of Cardinals met in Vatican City following the death of Pope Francis to select a new Vicar of Christ. Following a lifetime of dedication to the Catholic Church in both Chicago and Peru, Prevost was revealed as Francis' successor.\nBorn on September 14, 1955, in Chicago, Illinois, to parents of Spanish and Franco-Italian descent, Pope Leo XIV is one of three siblings. His brothers are John Prevost and Louis Martin Prevost. His passion for the Catholic faith ignited at a young age, leading him to enter the seminary immediately after eighth grade. Among his interests, Pope Leo XIV is an amateur tennis player, a Chicago White Sox fan, and he obtained Peruvian citizenship in 2015.\nPope Leo XIV graduated from Villanova University in 1977, a private Catholic institution located 12 miles outside Philadelphia, and received an honorary degree from Merrimack College. Before ascending to Bishop of Rome, he joined the novitiate of the Order of Saint Augustine in Saint Louis in 1977, marking the beginning of his religious training before taking his holy orders. In August 1981, he gave his solemn vows, and by 1982, he was ordained as a priest. In 1985, he joined the Augustinian mission in Peru, serving as chancellor of the Territorial Prelature of Chulucanas for a year. Between 1987 and 1988, he returned to the U.S. to serve as pastor for vocations and director of missions for the Augustinian Province of Chicago, before returning to Peru for another decade to lead the Augustinian seminary in Trujillo and teach Canon Law. In 1999, he returned to Chicago and was elected provincial prior of the Mother of Good Counsel.\nPope Leo XIV caught the attention of Pope Francis, who, after becoming pope in 2013, appointed him as the administrator and eventually archbishop of Chiclayo in 2014. During his final years in Peru, Prevost served as vice-president of the permanent council of the Peruvian Bishops\u2019 Conference from 2018 to 2023, a role that likely helped him secure his position as prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops under Francis. In January 2023, Pope Francis brought Prevost to the Vatican to serve as prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops, a crucial role responsible for vetting bishop nominations worldwide.\nPrevost was created a cardinal by Pope Francis in 2023.\nPope Leo XIV was floated as a frontrunner to succeed Pope Francis after his passing on April 21, 2025, although some reports suggested that his American nationality might count against him due to concerns about the U.S. exerting geopolitical influence through the papacy. At 69, Pope Leo XIV was elected to the papal seat on the second day of the papal conclave\u2019s deliberations at the Vatican."

God made you that way and loves you as you are and I don\u2019t mind. The pope loves you as you are, you have to be happy with who you are.\u201d\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that the Vatican did not confirm the pope\u2019s comments given that it was a private conversation.\nThe pope has upheld Catholic teaching on homosexuality, reiterating the church's opposition to same-sex relationships.\nFrancis uttered his \"Who am I to judge?\" comment during his first airborne press conference in 2013, signaling a new era of acceptance and welcome for gays in the church. Francis followed up by meeting with gay and transgender faithful.\nFr. James Martin, the author of \u201cBuilding a Bridge,\u201d told The Times that Francis\u2019 reported comments are a \u201cbig deal\u201d because it is likely the first time the pope made a comment \u201cabout gay people being born that way.\u201d\nMartin told the paper that the pope made the reported comment in private and not on the record, which is a big difference.\nMeanwhile, every active Chilean bishop offered to resign Friday over what Francis said was their \u201cgrave negligence\u201d in investigating abuse and protecting children.\nThe bishops announced at the end of an emergency Vatican summit that all 31 active bishops in Rome had signed a document offering to resign.\nCalls for mass resignations had mounted after details emerged of the contents of a 2,300-page Vatican report into the Chilean scandal leaked early Friday. Francis had cited the report in footnotes of a 10-page document that he handed over to each Chilean bishop at the start of the summit.\nFor years, sex abuse victims have blasted the Chilean hierarchy for discrediting their claims, protecting abusers and moving them around rather than reporting them to police and then handing out light sentences when church sanctions were imposed.\nFrancis, though, has also been implicated in the scandal and he took responsibility for his role as well.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report"
