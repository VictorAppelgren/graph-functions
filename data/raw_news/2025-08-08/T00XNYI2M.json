  "title": "Chicago's budget shortfall puts spotlight on Mamdani's 'socialism' agenda for New York City",
  "description": "NYC mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani faces criticism over costly socialist policies that opponents warn could create a fiscal crisis similar to Chicago.",
  "content": "Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson warns that finances in the nation's third most populous city have \"reached a point of no return.\"\n\nThe mayor said this week that the city will need to take steps to deal with looming budget shortfalls and that key systems that Chicago provides, including education, housing, health care and transportation, are \"woefully underfunded.\"\n\nEight-hundred miles to the east, there are concerns in the nation's most populous city that if democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani wins the election in November as New York City's next mayor, the city could be headed for a fiscal abyss similar to the crisis half a century ago, when it came close to bankruptcy.\n\nIncumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who dropped out of the 2025 race for New York City's Democratic Party mayor nomination and who is running for re-election as an independent, struck a deal with the city council on a roughly $116 billion budget for fiscal year 2026.\n\n\"There are no perfect budgets. But we have come a long way, and this one gets pretty close,\" City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams said at a press conference announcing the deal in late June.\n\nCUOMO FLIPS SCIPT ON MAMDANI IN NEW YORK CITY MAYORAL RACE\n\nBut the 33-year-old Mamdani, who is the polling frontrunner over Adams, former New York State Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and two other contenders in November's general election, is running on an expensive platform to tackle affordability and inequality in one of the nation's most expensive cities.\n\nMamdani grabbed national attention in late June after topping Cuomo and nine other candidates in the Democratic Party primary, as he took a big step towards becoming the first Muslim and first millennial mayor.\n\nMamdani, a Ugandan-born state assemblyman from the New York City borough of Queens, is proposing to eliminate fares to ride New York City's vast bus system, making CUNY (City University of New York) \"tuition-free,\" freezing rents on municipal housing, offering \"free childcare\" for children up to age 5, and setting up government-run grocery stores.\n\nThere are concerns that the significant spending increases to pay for Mamdani's proposals, along with the possibility of revenue shortfalls, could put a strain on New York City's budget.\n\nAnd at the center of Mamdani's proposals to pay for his pricey plans is a \"millionaire's tax,\" which critics say will spur ultra-wealthy New York City residents to flee.\n\nMamdani's agenda has given Republicans plenty of fodder to use to go on offense, as they spotlight his \"socialist\" policies and try to anchor him to Democrats facing challenging re-elections next year. President Donald Trump has gone further, accusing Mamdani of being a \"communist.\"\n\nAnd Mamdani's rivals in November's mayoral election are also taking aim at him.\n\nAdams has said Mamdani is making \"false promises\" that will hurt low-income New Yorkers. And the mayor argues that Mamdani's proposal to set up government-run supermarkets will \"devastate the local bodegas and local stores.\"\n\nCuomo, as he proposed his own plan to address affordability in New York City, said on Thursday that Mandani is \"proposing a theory of socialism that has never worked anywhere.\"\n\n\"What is the best answer to affordability? It is business development. It is opportunity. It is jobs. It is economic growth. It is not anti-business socialism,\" Cuomo said as he asked and answered his own question.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFiring back, Mamdani campaign spokesperson Dora Pekec claimed that \"trusting Andrew Cuomo to address New York\u2019s affordability crisis is the equivalent of tasking an arsonist with putting out a fire \u2014 he created this crisis.\"\n\n\"Trusting Andrew Cuomo to address New York\u2019s affordability crisis is the equivalent of tasking an arsonist with putting out a fire \u2014 he created this crisis,\" Mamdani spokesperson Dora Pekec said in a statement.",

      "text": "The Chicago Tribune warned on Thursday that Mayor Brandon Johnson\u2019s progressive policy proposals may scare businesses away from the already struggling city.\nAs officials anticipate a $1.2 billion deficit, Johnson spoke to reporters on Tuesday about his plans to fix the local economy, particularly how the \"billionaires and ultra-rich\" can have \"more skin in the game.\"\n\"Everything has to be on the table. Everything has to be on the table,\" Johnson said of his plans. The Chicago Tribune, which has criticized Johnson before, warned this does not bode well for the local economy.\nIn a piece headlined, \"Mayor Johnson offers multiple ideas to scare businesses out of Chicago,\" the newspaper's editorial board outlined how \"Halloween comes early with Johnson\u2019s \u2018progressive revenue\u2019 specifics.\"\nMAYOR JOHNSON WARNS TRUMP AGAINST DEPLOYING FEDERAL TROOPS FOR IMMIGRATION CRACKDOWN IN CHICAGO\n\"Among the possibilities the mayor said 'have to be on the table': reviving the corporate head tax; imposing a thinly disguised corporate income tax; and 'asking' universities, endowments and other large-scale nonprofits to pay substantial sums in lieu of the property taxes from which they are shielded,\" The Tribune said.\nThe editorial board singled out the head tax as a particularly disastrous policy. The policy, which \"Mayor Rahm Emanuel rightly killed in 2014,\" is one where businesses are taxed based on how many employees they have. The board argued such a policy \"is a disincentive to hire people,\" particularly amid the emerges of new technologies.\n\"With the rise in artificial intelligence, companies nationwide already are laying off workers who are performing functions corporate leaders believe AI can do instead. If Johnson truly wants to jump-start AI-induced white-collar employment losses in Chicago, there are few more effective ways than bringing back the head tax,\" The Tribune warned.\nBut beyond ill-advised policy, the outlet highlighted one proposal it claims claim Johnson does not even have the right to enforce.\n\"That leaves a more pernicious proposal pushed by the nonprofit Institute for the Public Good, which has a representative on the mayor\u2019s working group,\" The Tribune reported. \"Based on a tax Seattle approved several years ago, that group has floated an \u2018excise tax\u2019 on payrolls for those making $200,000 or more (including stock options and various forms of noncash compensation) \u2014 meant to substitute for a corporate income tax that Chicago doesn\u2019t have the legal authority to impose.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\nThe piece warned that across the multiple policies he proposed, \"By once again focusing only on economically destructive taxes that we\u2019re guessing won\u2019t get far with skittish aldermen afraid to tie their political futures to a deeply unpopular mayor, Johnson risks a reprise of last year\u2019s eleventh-hour budget crisis.\"\nAnother aspect pointed out by the Chicago Tribune is that Johnson laid out these and other policy proposals long before his working group will discuss them at an upcoming meeting in August, a key detail which the Tribune suggested speaks volumes about his leadership.\n\"By saying he\u2019s on board with several highly controversial tax proposals before his group even weighs in, Johnson now has confirmed, at least in the minds of his numerous skeptics, that the exercise always was little more than window dressing for an administration bent on doing what it has wanted to do from the start \u2014 soak the \u2018rich\u2019 in order to bankroll an ever-growing government apparatus,\" The Tribune wrote.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nFox News Digital reached out to Johnson\u2019s office and did not receive an immediate reply."

Meanwhile, the cost of living crisis confronting working class people across the city hits the LGBTQIA+ community particularly hard, with higher rates of unemployment and homelessness than the rest of the city.\n\"The Mamdani administration will protect LGBTQIA+ New Yorkers by expanding and protecting gender-affirming care citywide, making NYC an LGBTQIA+ sanctuary city, and creating the Office of LGBTQIA+ Affairs.\""
