  "content": "Oh, how far Garmin\u2019s designs have come\n\nSo, when I took the Forerunner 970 out of its box and put it on my wrist, I may as well have been strapping a UFO to my arm. It\u2019s about as far apart from the Forerunner 10 as a watch could be, and I generally mean that in the best of ways. Long gone is the old black and white display that may as well have been for a Tamagotchi, with a crisp 1.4-inch AMOLED face sitting in its place. This isn\u2019t my first adventure with Garmin\u2019s vibrant new display style (I\u2019ve previously worn everything from the Forerunner 965 to the Epix Pro 2 to the Instinct 3), but something about this housing might be my favorite.\n\nThe Forerunner 970 is light enough that I forget it's on my wrist, but tough enough that I'm not worried about it.\n\nI love Garmin's Race Predictor \u2014 it's the perfect motivation to prove my watch wrong.\n\nThere\u2019s just one problem with more power\u2026\n\nWith the Forerunner 970, though, I\u2019m getting my first taste of battery anxiety on a Garmin. By anxiety, I mean that I\u2019m charging it a little more than once every 10 or 12 days, which is comparatively a lot. At first, I thought the drop in battery life might have been in my head, but Garmin\u2019s projected average is right at 15 days. It\u2019s a slight drop from the 16 days of the Fenix 8 and a much steeper dip from the 20 that the Forerunner 955 Solar was rated for, and I\u2019ve yet to figure out if the benefits are worth the costs. The long run I detailed above zapped an astonishing 10% of my battery, which didn\u2019t send me scurrying for a charger, but it made me think twice about the minimum charge I\u2019ll run with.\n\nMore than a week of charge is great... but not up to my lofty Garmin expectations.\n\nThe Forerunner 970 is absolutely brilliant, but I'm struggling with a 50% price increase.",

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nThe Garmin Forerunner 570 is a powerful running watch but the price is all wrong\nJuly 13, 2025\nGarmin Forerunner 570\nMSRP: $549.00\nWhat we like\nWhat we don't like\nGarmin Forerunner 570\nI\u2019ve spent the past few weeks testing the Garmin Forerunner 570, Garmin\u2019s latest addition to its long-running Forerunner lineup. On paper, it\u2019s as close to perfect as a running watch gets. I love everything from its looks to its excellent battery life, and it offers the kind of performance data serious endurance athletes will fully appreciate.\nBut as good as it is, I\u2019ve come away wondering who it\u2019s actually for. Depressingly priced at a princely $549, it\u2019s too expensive (and frankly too advanced) for casual users, yet probably not comprehensive enough for the high-end Garmin crowd.\nLooking the part\nStarting with what I genuinely loved, the Forerunner 570\u2019s aesthetics nail the balance between athletic and refined. The watch is available in two case sizes, 42mm and 47mm, both of which feature an aluminum bezel that adds just enough polish to make it elevated without going full luxury. I tested the 42mm model in Cloud Blue, which is white with icy blue detailing, and could easily award it a permanent spot in my everyday wardrobe. It\u2019s subtle, modern, and versatile enough to wear all day, not just during workouts. Both case sizes come in a few different colorways, and while I haven\u2019t worn all of them myself, every version looks equally attractive, even if some are quite a bit bolder.\nThe full lineup touts colorful AMOLED displays just like the 265 and 965, suggesting Garmin has really nailed the coffin shut on new MIPS in this product line. The 570\u2019s case itself is a little thick, but still lightweight enough to feel plenty comfortable during long runs. The bulk was also non-issue when I wore it to bed for sleep tracking. The adjustable band is soft, breathable, and very easy to rinse. Most importantly, it keeps the watch flush on my wrist with zero movement or bounce during workouts.\nWith a polished look and a full-color AMOLED display, the Forerunner 570 is as attractive as it is comfortable.\nIt\u2019s not just the hardware that shines either. Below the glass, Garmin\u2019s revamped interface is also a noticeable upgrade. The updated look, which has been making its way across the Garmin stable, feels long overdue and makes the watch far easier to navigate. The software experience is faster, more modern, and just nicer to use. Overall, it\u2019s a watch that doesn\u2019t scream \u201cserious triathlete,\u201d but definitely whispers it.\nA packed feature list with confusing omissions\nThe Forerunner 570 brings almost every modern Garmin feature to the table. It includes dual-band GNSS and a boatload of sport modes (including more than 20 new ones), plus a broad list of health tracking features and uniquely Garmin tools like Body Battery. Health-wise, the device adds overnight skin temperature tracking and past ovulation estimations for those who menstruate.\nTraining-wise, it adds a bit more. Many of its fitness tracking upgrades have been seen elsewhere in the Garmin stable, but new adds include Finish Line Estimates, Automatic Lap by Timing Gate and structured multisport workouts, plus access to new Garmin Coach Triathlon Plans, all of which highlight that this is a watch designed for runners (in case the name didn\u2019t make it clear). I used it for tempo runs, long hikes, treadmill sessions, and neighborhood jogs, and it kept up without missing a beat.\nThe 570 packs a range of new features for runners, plus all the expected health and fitness tracking tools.\nI also loved the addition of Projected Race Time. I don\u2019t have any events on the calendar, but checking what my potential 5K or 10K time might be helped me analyze my training regimen, aka motivated me to run a little harder.\nAs for smartwatch tools, the watch still boasts 8GB to support onboard music storage, but now adds a built-in speaker as well as a microphone. This lets you go full James Bond with Bluetooth-connected phone calling as well as voice assistance and onboard voice commands. I can\u2019t say I see myself making many calls from my wrist, and I don\u2019t typically carry my phone on runs or rides, but the quality here is good if needed in a pinch. Voices came through clearly, and the watch registered my input efficiently.\nThe newest Forerunners also debut Evening Reports, which offer recaps of your activity plus guidance for your evening and the following day. It\u2019s basically that one coworker in an excessively long meeting who pays really good attention so they can sum up all the key takeaways at the end in case you zoned out. I love this automated summary and the sleep coach tips it hits me with right as I start thinking about whether or not to put on a show or hit the bed.\nYet even with a truly bloated feature set, I\u2019m left wanting. With a price tag listed at $549, it is hard to ignore what is missing. First, while the Forerunner 570 features Garmin\u2019s Elevate Gen5 optical HR sensor, it does not include the brand\u2019s ECG app. This is baffling when you consider the Garmin Venu 3, priced much lower at $349, offers ECG support. It is also a feature shoppers expect from most smartwatches in this price range. Leaving it off makes the watch feel intentionally limited, potentially so that the company can justify the 970s price tag.\nWhile the Forerunner 570 boasts Garmin's latest heart rate sensor, it does not feature ECG support.\nLikewise, the watch doesn\u2019t add a flashlight like the 970 and lacks any built-in mapping. I appreciated the ability to follow a breadcrumb trail when I veered off-path, but I am disappointed that the device doesn\u2019t have detailed topographic maps like the 970, especially at this price bump. There are other tools differentiating the pricier model from this mid-tier one, and that\u2019s fair, but these are the biggest offenders in my mind when asking shoppers to drop half a grand.\nThe 570 is, without a doubt, a better watch than the 265. But it is not a huge leap forward. And when you compare it to the 970, which adds ECG, the 570 feels like it is stuck in a weird in-between space. It is a tough sell when the 265 gives you 90 percent of the experience for $200 less, or the 970 gives you everything for just $100 to $150 more.\nAccurate as always\nWhen it comes to core metrics like GPS and heart rate tracking, Garmin is nothing if not consistent. The Forerunner 570 delivers accuracy on both fronts.\nI compared its dual-band GNSS tracking to routes logged with a chest strap and reference-grade devices, and the results were near flawless. It hugged tight corners accurately, avoided common GPS drift in tree cover and urban areas, and maintained smooth, believable pace and elevation data even during trail runs. On the map above, you can see one of my tracked neighborhood runs that nearly matches the route recorded by my Apple Watch Ultra 2. There are small fluctuations, but not enough to impact my training data, and the two devices recorded identical total distances.\nHeart rate performance was just as reliable. Across tempo efforts, interval sessions, and long steady-state runs, the Elevate Gen 5 sensor held impressively close to my chest strap readings with minimal lag. I\u2019ve garnered the same level of results from other devices with the same hardware, like the Venu 3, so I wasn\u2019t surprised, but still pleased. Whether you\u2019re training by heart rate zone or just need confidence in your data, the 570 doesn\u2019t flinch.\nGarmin Forerunner 570: The verdict\nThe Garmin Forerunner 570 is a polished, high-performing, and impressively accurate running watch. It is comfortable, looks great, and has nearly every feature a serious runner could want. But at $549, it is also a watch that feels caught between tiers. It doesn\u2019t offer enough over the Forerunner 265 ($449.99 at Garmin), which often goes on sale to below $400, to warrant the price bump for most users, and it holds back just enough to make the Forerunner 970 ($749.99 at Amazon) a better long-term investment. It\u2019s a fantastic watch caught in a pricing purgatory. For most people, better value lies on either side.\nIn a vacuum, the 570 is a fantastic watch, but its price and feature set are hard to position in Garmin's stable.\nEvery time I start a Garmin review, I assume I\u2019m going to love the device. The truth is that the company rarely misses. In a vacuum, the Forerunner 570 retains that pattern with reliable hardware, a refined interface, and more training tools than I can reasonably make use of in one review period. But the watch doesn\u2019t exist in a bubble, and that makes it hard to recommend.\n- Stylish, attractive aesthetic\n- Full-color AMOLED display\n- Updated, more premium UI\n- Accurate heart rate and GPS tracking\n- New training features, especially for runners\n- Added smartwatch tools and Evening reports\n- Baffling price positioning in Forerunner series\n- No ECG support\n- No built-in maps\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nI ditched Strava Premium for Garmin Connect Plus, but I'm switching back\nApril 19, 2025\nI\u2019ve been a Strava user for as long as I can remember \u2014 or at least since I started taking fitness seriously again at the tail end of college. Shortly after, I upgraded to Strava Premium, hoping it would give me a better training plan than I was getting from Nike Run Club. Since then, I\u2019ve watched Strava evolve, picking up new mapping features and adding social elements like messaging, and I\u2019m impressed by what it\u2019s become.\nHowever, I also find myself using fewer and fewer of the platform\u2019s latest features, either because I\u2019m not traveling to as many new places or because I don\u2019t need Strava DMs to keep in touch with my friends. So, I let my membership lapse and decided to try Garmin\u2019s new Connect Plus service. Here\u2019s how it\u2019s going so far.\nDMs vs data: What does Garmin Connect Plus get you?\nAs a new premium service, you might not be entirely sure what Garmin\u2019s Connect Plus platform offers. After all, Garmin has never offered a paid subscription for features like its Body Battery before, so it\u2019s easy to worry that previously free features will suddenly get locked behind a paywall. As far as I can tell, that\u2019s not the case. Instead, Garmin Connect Plus adds more detail to safety features like LiveTrack and new social options, like badges for completing challenges from one month to the next.\nHowever, Garmin\u2019s new set of performance-focused metrics encouraged me to try something new. Connect has always been about offering insights into your data, forecasting your race performances, measuring your sleep, and more, and I was curious to see how Garmin would take it further. With Connect Plus, you now get a tab of Active Intelligence, which is powered by AI, and a Performance Dashboard that offers 123 different metrics, of which you can view 18 at any one time \u2014 both of which seem more valuable to me than Strava\u2019s new spinning thumbs up animation when you deal some kudos.\nHow you interpret those metrics is up to you, as Garmin doesn\u2019t offer insights in the dashboard itself, just raw data. That said, it does work them into its Active Intelligence blurbs on a rotating basis, as I\u2019ve had Garmin applaud the consistency of my HRV over the last few weeks of sleeping. Garmin also says that Connect Plus offers expert guidance in its training plans through coach-led videos, but I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve been following mine for long enough to receive direction just yet.\nWhy did I switch to Garmin Connect Plus?\nThe simple answer for switching from Strava Premium to Garmin Connect Plus is that I wanted to try something new. With Strava\u2019s recent price increases and the natural stopping point of the end of my annual payment, I figured there was no harm in losing the additional features, even for a month or two. Besides, all my running shoes are already logged in my gear list, and I want the dopamine that comes with each new kudo anyway.\nSo, I allowed my little Strava Premium icon to disappear and quickly started my free month of Connect Plus. Yes, my first hiccup with Garmin\u2019s new service \u2014 which costs $6.99 per month \u2014 is that you only get a one-month trial. Given how much Garmin watches cost, I\u2019d love to see that trial get extended in the future, though I imagine many people will make up their minds after just a few weeks.\nI know Garmin's base features will remain free, but a one-month trial isn't enough when you buy a $1,000 GPS watch.\nEither way, I\u2019d have to call my experience through the first week or so incomplete. Like most Garmin features, Connect Plus and its Active Intelligence rely on a strong base of data to work with, which means being more regular about sleeping with the same watch each night and syncing it to the same phone each day. It\u2019s not something that will be difficult for most people, but it can be a bit of a challenge when my job involves switching phones (and watches) so often.\nThat said, I did jump into a new training plan to mark the start of my Connect Plus journey, which has me slowly but surely preparing for the Baltimore Running Festival in mid-October. I know I\u2019m much too far out to start marathon-centric workouts, but I was curious to see how Connect Plus would handle a longer build-up, especially with adding strength workouts to the mix. So far, this has been one of the brighter spots of my experience, as my Fenix 8 AMOLED is pretty good about delaying workouts from one day to the next when I don\u2019t feel like sprinting in the pouring rain or choking humidity.\nAlso, because I haven\u2019t been traveling much \u2014 or at least not to too many new cities \u2014 I figured I wouldn\u2019t need Strava\u2019s mapping or route-building features for a little while. I don\u2019t love that Garmin\u2019s replacement is just downloading GPX files to your watch, but it\u2019s slightly better than nothing.\nSorry, Garmin, I think I\u2019m switching back to Strava Premium\nAs much as I love my Garmin GPS watches and will always recommend them above alternatives from Coros, Suunto, and Polar, I\u2019m not sure that Connect Plus has yet found its place in my heart. Yes, I like that it puts a ton of data into my hands through the Performance Dashboard, but I think I\u2019ve realized that Strava makes many of those metrics more digestible. It\u2019s a little quicker to compare one workout to the next and offer insights into segments that you ran faster than before or ways that you managed your heart rate just a little better.\nAlso, I had decently high hopes for Garmin\u2019s Active Intelligence, but I think I like Strava\u2019s AI-powered workout recaps a bit better. They\u2019re a little simpler, pulling information about your heart rate and overall effort rather than giving you a quick tip about one of your many health metrics. Does either one feel essential at this point? No, but I find that Strava is more willing to praise my efforts.\nStrava's AI insights are easier for me to use, and its map creation is far ahead of Garmin's.\nOne last point in favor of Strava Premium is that it simply has a much larger base of users to work with. Almost all of my friends use Strava, which means they contribute to the community heatmaps, which then make planning runs safer for everyone. If I want to create a route in Garmin, I often have to find a preexisting one and import it rather than simply opening the map in Strava and setting my workout parameters. I\u2019m sure if I wanted to, I could learn how to create and download the maps I want, but it\u2019s so hard to compete with Strava\u2019s fleshed-out network.\nSo, at least for now, I\u2019m going to head back to the app I\u2019ve already supported for so many years. I\u2019m excited to see how Garmin Connect Plus grows and develops over the next few updates, but Strava\u2019s current set of features is just too much better. If you\u2019re going to do the same, make sure you sign up for the annual Strava Premium subscription rather than the monthly one \u2014 $79.99 for 12 months is much, much better than $11.99 per month, no question.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nI tried Garmin Coach for strength training and it springboarded me back into shape\nMarch 6, 2025\nLate in 2025, Garmin introduced a new tool: Garmin Coach Strength Training. Freshly postpartum at the time, I noted the addition with an approving nod, then swiftly turned back to my Oreos and sleep deprivation. However, when the time came to get back into working out (as the job requires), I decided to see what the new training programs were all about. Four weeks later, I\u2019m sold.\nHave you tried Garmin Coach Strength Training?\nGetting going with Garmin\nGetting back in shape \u2014 \u201cin shape\u201d being used generously here \u2014 never sounds fun to me. Whether recovering from an injury or simply resuming exercise after a fitness hiatus, starting over is physically exhausting physically and mentally taxing. Fortunately, that\u2019s where Garmin Coach comes in. The company\u2019s adaptive plans help users offload some of the mental effort of getting (or staying) fit by doing all the planning for you. Previously, these programs have been tailored to runners and cyclists, with training plans for specific events and goals, like a 5k or a triathlon. Now, Garmin offers strength training plans to complement the cardio-centric ones.\nIn addition to cardio-centric Garmin Coach programs, the company now offers a Strength Training program.\nAfter a lot of self-bribery, I finally rolled out my yoga mat, collected my various weights, and got started. Then I spent the next 30 minutes sitting crisscross apple sauce, trying to sync my fitness tracker and access the strength training options. It took a few rounds of updating my app, updating my watch, and syncing my devices before the options showed up. Meanwhile, my partner\u2019s account had the feature instantly available. If you have a compatible tracker or smartwatch but don\u2019t see Strength Training under Garmin Coach, make sure your software is up to date. Garmin Coach Strength Training is compatible with all of the devices listed below.\n- Enduro 3\n- Forerunner 255, 255S, 255 Music, 255S Music\n- Forerunner 265,265S\n- Forerunner 955, 955 Solar\n- Forerunner 965\n- fenix 8, 8 Solar\n- fenix E\n- Venu 3, 3S\n- v\u00edvoactive 5\nI\u2019m fortunate to have a few of these wearables on hand, and I appreciated the ability to use the program regardless of which one I wore. Setting up and starting the program takes place primarily on your smartphone using the Connect app.\nSetting goals\nTo get started, Garmin prompts users to choose between three comprehensive goals: increasing max strength, building muscle mass, or simply getting fit. From there, you can specify what equipment you have access to and review plan options for details like the number of workouts per week and workout duration.\nI specified my goals, set up a schedule, and got to work establishing benchmarks.\nFor my goal, I chose \u201cGet Fit,\u201d which involves workouts using lighter weights for higher reps, along with plenty of body-weight exercises. I selected the Fitness Activator plan (because of the aforementioned Oreos) and chose my preferred training days. Garmin immediately scheduled out my four-week plan, including rest days (which gave me an excuse to buy a massage gun). You can tap into each workout to preview what\u2019s coming and also edit exercises as needed. On the first day, I completed an AMRAP (as many reps as possible) workout to set benchmarks. At the end of the program, Garmin prompts users to repeat this workout to take stock of their progress.\nFollowing the program\nTo cut to the chase: I love this new tool. A free fitness coach that fits on my wrist appeals to my wallet and my deep-seated introversion. I absolutely loved having a plan to follow and all the tools I needed to succeed. The workouts might be basic for some, but I found the intensity aligned with my fitness perfectly, and it was easy to push myself within the scheduled routine. I also felt like I got a full-body workout, something I struggle with on my own.\nFrom a technical standpoint, the on-device features were also a huge help. Throughout each workout, I could check in with my live heart rate or swipe down to view my heart rate zone. Exercises were queued up and prompted, and the workouts themselves were managed for me. Most importantly, countdowns for timed intervals and automatic rep detection helped keep me honest.\nThe program does all the work for me from structuring workouts to counting reps.\nDespite learning from Count von Count on Sesame Street, I inevitably always botch my rep counts, especially during miserable exercises like up-downs or burpees. I either subconsciously skip numbers and do too few or forget to count entirely and end up doing roughly 1000 (or it feels like at least). Though Garmin occasionally missed a rep or two, it was typically quite accurate.\nFor exercises I hadn\u2019t done before, Garmin had easy-to-follow how-to videos with recommended forms. These data screens also include context for each exercise, including difficulty level, projected muscle engagement, and tips for best practices. This is a great resource for beginners new to weight training, but also a helpful refresher for even gym afficionados.\nA few times, I had to check an exercise I hadn\u2019t heard of before, only to discover Garmin labeled something very basic with an unusual name. This is a bit annoying, but as long as I remembered to glance through each workout before starting, it wasn\u2019t an issue. Garmin also offers an impressive range of exercises, which I appreciate as someone who thrives on variety. A helpful \u201cRecents\u201d menu also made hunting down exercises very easy as the program progressed.\nFor beginners, Garmin also provides resources about exercise form and muscle impact.\nOn-device, you can also dig into each work out to look more closely at your training. Tapping any exercise in the workout will pull up a detailed graphic highlighting the primary, secondary, and untargeted muscles. The illustration looks a little bit like a colorful version of crime scene chalk outline, but to be honest, that feels appropriate in the face of some exercises (again, I loathe up-downs, or squat thrusts as Garmin calls them).\nThe synchronization between my devices also worked flawlessly. Workouts loaded to my watch each day, and stats made their way back to my smartphone after I finished. At any time, I could check my training schedule on my wrist or take a more detailed look on my smartphone. When I needed to bump a session one day because I got sidetracked by housework, I was able to reschedule the workout in the Connect app, and the change immediately appeared on my watch.\nThe synchronization or stats and details between the Garmin Connect app and my device was flawless.\nI also didn\u2019t need to take any extra steps to integrate my data with the rest of Garmin\u2019s toolkit. My workouts were easy to review, and my effort was consistently reflected in other features, such as my Body Battery. Garmin helped me manage my recovery time and keep an eye on my overall energy with features like Sleep Coach.\nThough I don\u2019t typically journal, I also appreciate Garmin\u2019s notes feature. Sometimes, I just recorded things to make myself laugh, but other times, the ability to jot down reflections on a particular exercise or workout was really helpful. I could look back later and remember that I struggled with push-ups because I was sore from swimming, not just because I was weak, which is also true.\nMost importantly, I can genuinely feel a difference in my fitness as a result of the training plan. Sure, there are better programs out there, including free ones. You can also always hire a trainer at your local gym. However, the adaptive nature of Garmin\u2019s service, and the fact that it\u2019s free, is great, especially for beginners.\nGarmin Coach Strength Training verdict\nTo be clear, if muscle could be built purely by thinking about exercising, I\u2019d have the BMI of an Olympian. More often than not, though, I talk myself into the path of least resistance: a run or a cycle, followed by half-assed stretching. When I do decide to weight train, I either repeat the exact same routine I\u2019ve done for years, or I float between circuit training machines until enough time passes that I feel I can go home. In other words, the mere fact that Garmin automatically structures workouts for me is enough to hook me. Even if you are already in fantastic shape, sometimes guidance is the best motivation.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nI really like the Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED, even if one thing keeps me from loving it\nJanuary 28, 2025\nGarmin Instinct 3 AMOLED\nMSRP: $449.99\nWhat we like\nWhat we don't like\nGarmin Instinct 3 AMOLED\nThese days, new GPS watches (and smartwatches in general) seem to be all about more, more, more. If they\u2019re not adding something new like better battery life, new activities to track, or upgraded smart assistant features, why waste your time? I know that to be true, partly because I\u2019m guilty of it, too \u2014 look at my recent Garmin Fenix 8 and Enduro 3 reviews. I praised Garmin for finding ways to add new wrinkles, and I am perfectly happy to brush off their nearly $1,000 price tags.\nAnd yet, ever since I strapped on the Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED, I\u2019ve seen things differently. I\u2019ve been adapting to life without a touchscreen or a smart assistant and loving it. It\u2019s the opposite of the Garmin experience I\u2019m used to, yet one that I\u2019ve enjoyed far more than I thought I would. In some ways, the Instinct 3 has put the adventure back into my adventure watch, which makes its main flaw that much more frustrating.\n\"We have resolved the underlying issue causing some devices to be stuck on the start up screen or a blue triangle. If you are still experiencing this, please visit support.garmin.com for steps to resolve the issue.\"\nLiving out my G-Shock dreams\nWhen I was younger, I thought the Casio G-Shock was the coolest-looking watch on the market. It was big and bulky and looked like it could take a beating. Better yet, it came in a ton of bright, borderline obnoxious colors that warmed my neon-loving middle-school heart. Eventually, I grew up and moved on to slimmer, more mature smartwatches like the pebble-like Pixel Watch and Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 for life between workouts. My fondness for a chunky, rugged wearable remained, though, and when I saw the Instinct 3 AMOLED in its Neo Tropic color (pictured above, below, and everywhere), I was taken back in time.\nAnd luckily for me, I received that same Miami Dolphins-esque Neo Tropic version for review, this time in Garmin\u2019s smaller 45mm case. While I\u2019ll readily admit that it\u2019s impossible to match a watch that looks like toothpaste with a glass of orange juice to anything in my closet, I like that it\u2019s a bright, bold wearable. Of course, Garmin also offers its Instinct 3 AMOLED in a basic black version for both the 45mm and 50mm cases if you want something more subtle. Either way, Garmin\u2019s new stainless aluminum-reinforced bezel acts as its pop of color, offering peace of mind should you clatter your watch against a wall while rock climbing or slip on ice while running \u2014 ask me how I know.\nThe Instinct 3 AMOLED is my smallest, simplest Garmin wearable, and simplicity is bliss.\nOnce you\u2019ve settled on your size and color, navigating the Garmin Instinct 3 is about as simple as possible. This is the first Garmin watch I\u2019ve used in quite a while that comes without a touchscreen, so you\u2019ll have to become very comfortable with the five-button setup and the flashlight (marked Torch) tucked on the top edge. I struggled with this at first, almost instinctively (get it?) swiping with my finger whenever I wanted to check my sleep report or pull up a notification from my phone. Since then, though, I\u2019ve retrained my brain to reach for the buttons on the left side of the small frame when I need to jump back and forth. If I have one complaint with the buttons on the Instinct 3 AMOLED, it\u2019s the fact that they\u2019re almost flush with the frame. I often miss them when I think I\u2019ve pressed them, and I accidentally pull my own arm hair just as often.\nBare patch on my wrist aside, the largely plastic Instinct 3 AMOLED has another benefit I didn\u2019t expect: It disappears on my wrist. After spending a few months with bigger, heavier watches like the Enduro 3 and Fenix 8 AMOLED, the mere 53g feels almost invisible. It\u2019s only about 10g lighter than the Enduro 3, which surprised me, given that Garmin\u2019s ultra-focused watch is a full 6mm larger. Perhaps I can chalk some of that invisibility up to the fact that I can get a much tighter fit from the Instinct\u2019s smaller body and the more natural curve of its built-in silicone band.\nOf course, longtime Instinct fans will remember that Garmin boasted about the potential for limitless battery life on the previous generation thanks to a solar charging ring. Essentially, the idea was that if you were getting outside and being active enough with your watch, the solar intake would out-pace the battery drain from the GPS tracking and Memory-in-Pixel (MiP) display. So, for the latest Instinct to adopt an AMOLED face, you might be worried that those limitless battery days are a thing of the past. Well, fear not, as there are now two Instinct models to choose from.\nYes, I may be reviewing the AMOLED version, but Garmin also offers an Instinct 3 Solar in 45mm and 50mm case sizes if you\u2019re hoping for limitless battery life (assuming you spend enough time in the sun). You\u2019ll have to trade the special Neo Tropic color for a Twilight version, but the rest of the features are pretty much the same as far as buttons, health tracking, and display sizes go. Perhaps the main decision you\u2019ll face is whether or not you think the MiP display is bright enough for use in strong sunlight.\nAlthough it doesn\u2019t have unlimited battery life, the Instinct 3 AMOLED is no slouch. Garmin claims that its smaller 45mm version is good for 18 days between charges, while the larger 50mm model should hit 24 days before you\u2019re searching for your proprietary cable. Actual usage is often slightly lower, so let\u2019s move on to activity tracking.\nActivity tracking remains second to none\nAlthough my last two Garmin reviews came during beautifully busy parts of the year (marathon season for yours truly), the Instinct 3 AMOLED arrived at a different moment: The middle of a frigid, snowy winter. And, on the one hand, that\u2019s great \u2014 I still like to pretend I\u2019m young enough to sled down the hills of Baltimore\u2019s Patterson Park \u2014 but it\u2019s made the rest of my winter workouts just a bit tougher. Oh, and the problems I mentioned with pressing the five buttons around the Instinct 3 don\u2019t exactly go away when I\u2019m trying to do so in thick gloves.\nCold weather aside, when it comes right down to it, the Instinct 3 AMOLED is still a reliable, action-packed Garmin GPS watch. Despite my protestations as I pull on a third shirt or a second pair of tights to head out into the ten-degree morning (that\u2019s Fahrenheit, not Celsius), my watch is ready to go when I press the button to start my run. And, since I\u2019m not currently training for a marathon \u2014 though I\u2019m training for a different type of race that I\u2019ll touch on in a second \u2014I\u2019ve had no problem with the Instinct 3 lasting through all of my runs, both while I was at the CES 2025 trade show recently (where we gave this same watch an award) and since I\u2019ve returned home.\nThe Instinct 3 AMOLED has a beefy little battery, and the fourth-generation Elevate sensor keeps drain to a minimum.\nThey\u2019ve been shorter runs of between three and nine miles, but I\u2019ve logged eleven and a half hours worth of activity and only had to find the proprietary USB-C charger that came with the Instinct 3 as I sat down to write this review. While that might not sound terribly impressive if I\u2019d received my Instinct 3 AMOLED for review with a fully charged battery, I unboxed it in Las Vegas at around an 80% charge and opted to plug it in with about 9% of its battery remaining.\nWhile my watch charges \u2014 which should only take about 90 minutes \u2014 let\u2019s look at one of the longer runs I logged while home. I decided to test both the watch and myself, heading out for a run on a knee that felt less than perfect after a training run in Harper\u2019s Ferry. Despite expecting quite a bit of discomfort as I trucked around Baltimore\u2019s Inner Harbor, my knee and the Instinct 3 spurred me to keep going. I followed the watch\u2019s recommendation for the day, which was an hour and fifteen minutes of running between an 8:10 and 8:30 pace per mile, working out to right around nine miles.\nOf course, nothing so far has come as a surprise to me. I\u2019ve already used Garmin\u2019s training plans to prepare for half marathons, and I\u2019m used to the always-excellent battery life that I can expect from a GPS watch that\u2019s not truly attempting to be a smartwatch. But, with the Instinct 3 AMOLED sporting the previous fourth-generation Elevate heart rate sensor rather than the fifth-generation sensor that I\u2019ve used on more recent wearables, I was curious if I\u2019d notice any change in its reliability. At a glance, the answer to that question seems to be both yes and no.\nThe reason that I say both yes and no to the reliability of the fourth-generation Elevate sensor is pretty much because of what you see above. Although there are no odd or wayward spikes \u2014 the peaks and valleys seem to follow the elevation of my running route \u2014 the tiny little spikes surprised me. It looks as though the Instinct 3 AMOLED struggled to make up its mind on a per-beat basis, especially where it looks like saw teeth for the minute or so that I spent at 160 beats per minute. On the other hand, most of my recent runs with a fifth-generation Elevate sensor seem to sit at a steady heart rate for longer, moving gently up and down rather than spiking.\nInterestingly, though, Garmin\u2019s record of my elevation tells the opposite story, holding me slightly flatter at certain points before stair-stepping me up or down. I don\u2019t necessarily think that this makes the elevation readout inaccurate \u2014 I\u2019d be surprised if I had fluctuated more than six meters while heading around the harbor. Still, it suggests that Garmin\u2019s slightly older hardware might not record as many data points as the newer sensors.\nOn the bright side, the Instinct 3 AMOLED largely nailed my pathway through the tall buildings of Harbor East. This is often a spot I\u2019ll pick out when testing a fitness tracker through Baltimore, simply because most wearables have a habit of tossing me into the side of a building or pushing me out into the harbor. While there\u2019s a little bit of that \u2014 notice the stretch right near Maritime Park \u2014 Garmin\u2019s mapping largely kept me out on the roads and sidewalks I\u2019ve learned to trust.\nAnd, for those days when I\u2019d rather not contribute too heavily to my weekly load of running laundry, the Instinct 3 AMOLED is an excellent bouldering companion. I mentioned how much I appreciate its compact size in the section above, but it comes in handy again when I\u2019m trying to navigate plastic holds and swing for dynamic moves. I\u2019ve yet to clatter the Instinct 3 AMOLED against anything in my home gym, which is especially impressive given the battle scars that both my Fenix 8 AMOLED and Enduro 3 bear. Like those other wearables, bouldering hardly makes a dent in the battery life of the Instinct 3 AMOLED, so I could easily spend all day at the gym and not sweat the remaining charge \u2014 at least, if my arms held up that long. Of course, if I do smack the Instinct 3 AMOLED against a hold, a volume, or anything else, I\u2019m not sure how well its plastic body would respond. Hopefully, I don\u2019t find out.\nAnd yet, I\u2019m trapped on familiar trails\nUnfortunately, it\u2019s time for the other shoe to drop \u2014 we have to talk about what\u2019s missing from the Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED. As I mentioned above, I\u2019m not currently training for a road marathon or anything like that, but I am instead training for a looped, five-hour trail race. And, with a race like that, I need to spend a lot more of my time training on trails than on roads. Without getting into the tiniest of trail-running details, it takes a whole different set of muscles when you leave the pavement behind (read: I\u2019m very sore).\nBut, part of training on trails means learning how to navigate trails, which can be done in one of two ways. First, you can set up every run as an out-and-back, running in a straight line until you decide it\u2019s time to turn around. Out-and-backs are pretty straightforward, you\u2019re making it impossible to take a wrong turn. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t work well when running in a twisting, turning state park where everything is designed to be a loop or a series of loops. And when that happens, your best bet is to download a GPX map to your watch so that you can follow turn-by-turn directions. The only problem is that the Instinct 3 AMOLED doesn\u2019t allow you to do that.\nSorry, Garmin, but I can't navigate purely on instincts.\nNo, despite looking and feeling like a watch meant for hiking and adventuring, the feature that Garmin decided to cut to keep the price of the Instinct 3 series in check is mapping. Technically, you can make a breadcrumb trail to retrace your steps back to the start, but then you\u2019re right back to the out-and-back that I described above. Also, I\u2019m running a looped race, so I\u2019d certainly like a watch with mapping support to guide my way \u2014 at least for the first trip around the circuit.\nAnd yes, I know that Garmin had to make some sacrifices to keep the Instinct 3 priced at about half of what the Fenix or Enduro costs, but I can\u2019t help feeling like it made the wrong call. I\u2019m not sure what the right one would have been \u2014 the older heart rate sensor and non-removable watch band also feel like logical calls \u2014 but taking downloadable maps out of the equation feels like relegating the Instinct 3 AMOLED to light adventures only. Maybe the Instinct 3 series would have been better served by skipping the built-in flashlight or sticking with a MiP-only display, but then again, I like having an easy-to-access light on my wrist, and the AMOLED panel is a significant upgrade over the MiP face in bright conditions.\nThankfully, other everyday features like Garmin Pay, the Body Battery, and sleep tracking with a Morning Report have also been spared from the axe, so it\u2019s not all bad, head-scratching news.\nGarmin Instinct 3 AMOLED review: Oh, so close\nAt this point, I think I\u2019m stuck. I want to love the Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED \u2014 I do love about 90% of the watch \u2014 but I\u2019m struggling to look past its major omission because of my own needs. I still think I\u2019m perfectly happy to trust Garmin\u2019s mid-priced GPS watch on familiar trails, weekly miles around the city, and trips to the climbing gym when I can\u2019t be bothered to go outside, but that lack of mapping really gives me pause. For a watch that looks and feels so ready for adventure, if you\u2019re a seasoned off-trail explorer, it can occasionally feel like a lifted Jeep that you can only take to the grocery store.\nAnd yet, that will be more than enough for most people. If you\u2019re just after a rugged-looking watch that comes without the sky-high price tag of something like Garmin\u2019s Enduro 3 or Fenix 8, then the Instinct 3 AMOLED will be perfect for you. Besides, it still has the everyday features you\u2019d want when you park your Jeep at the grocery store \u2014 like Garmin Pay \u2014 you\u2019ll just have to follow a friend with a higher-spec watch when the trail gets dicey. You\u2019ll still get Garmin\u2019s excellent sleep tracking, women\u2019s health metrics, and battery life that lasts weeks, too.\nIf you can live without mapping, the Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED is packed with value.\nOh, and if you do spring for the Instinct 3 AMOLED \u2014 in either the 45mm or 50mm case \u2014 I\u2019d highly recommend the Neo Tropic colorway. It\u2019s turned heads the entire time I\u2019ve had it on my wrist and stands out among a sea of otherwise mostly black fitness trackers on my desk. Then again, there\u2019s always the Instinct 3 Solar ($399.99 at Amazon), which offers the same base experience but rewards you considerably for spending time outdoors.\nOf course, if you\u2019re serious about trekking the trails and as bored by the idea of an out-and-back run as I am, then the Instinct 3 AMOLED is a bit tougher to recommend. Sure, you could keep a map on your phone or carry a dedicated GPS for your workouts, but then you\u2019re adding weight to your setup and ultimately slowing yourself down to pull out your phone and glance at a map. So, if that\u2019s the boat you find yourself in, it\u2019s time to get creative with some alternatives.\nGarmin\u2019s Fenix 8 AMOLED ($999.99 at Amazon) and Enduro 3 ($899.99 at Amazon) are excellent, but they\u2019re also twice as expensive as the Instinct 3 AMOLED and much larger. While you\u2019ll get extra goodies like optional titanium bezels and battery life that goes all month long, you might be put off by the idea of a watch as large as Captain America\u2019s shield on your wrist. I still think the 47mm Fenix 8 AMOLED is the best GPS watch I\u2019ve ever used, but I also know that $1,000 is a steep price to pay if you\u2019re not on an adventure almost every day. Also, the Enduro 3 will push you back to an older MiP display, but it\u2019s hard to argue with a whole month of battery life.\nInstead, I think the best map-toting alternatives to the Instinct 3 AMOLED meet somewhere in the middle. First is Garmin\u2019s own Forerunner 965 ($599.99 at Garmin) \u2014 a road-running watch. It\u2019s slightly larger than the Instinct and a bit more expensive, but it adds a larger case (47mm), a titanium bezel, and interchangeable watch bands to the setup. If not for access to Garmin\u2019s more recent adventure watches, the road-centric Forerunner 965 would probably still be on my wrist. One other option to consider, though, is the Coros Pace Pro ($349 at Amazon). In short, it\u2019s like Coros\u2019s version of the Forerunner 965, pairing an AMOLED face with three weeks of battery life and downloadable maps. However, the Pace Pro is more affordable than its Garmin counterparts, mainly because it skips creature comforts like an NFC chip for wireless payments.\nThank you for being part of our community.

Learn more.\nThe Garmin Fenix 8 AMOLED is the best 'ultra' smartwatch I've ever used\nNovember 12, 2024\nGarmin Fenix 8 AMOLED\nMSRP: $999.99\nWhat we like\nWhat we don't like\nGarmin Fenix 8 AMOLED\nWhen you see the word ultra in the name of, well, anything, you attach a particular set of expectations. You expect whatever it is to go above and beyond an average threshold and enter into some form of rarified air. The Galaxy S24 Ultra, for example, packs more cameras than any other Samsung device, and it\u2019s the only one to come with an integrated S Pen. Another, perhaps more fitting, example is the ultramarathon \u2014 a race that\u2019s longer (sometimes much longer) and more grueling than your standard 26.2-mile marathon. It\u2019s with that race in mind that the Ultra moniker made its way to top-end smartwatches from both Apple and Samsung, promising the ability to do more and last longer for the hardest of adventures.\nAnd it\u2019s true \u2014 the Apple Watch Ultra and Galaxy Watch Ultra are the biggest, longest-lasting wearables their respective companies have ever produced. They let you go days without charging and offer a mountain of features to keep you feeling connected. However, one watch embodies the Ultra spirit better than any other, and it does so without even mentioning the name. In my opinion, the best ultra watch that money can buy (because, yes, it\u2019s quite pricey) is the Garmin Fenix 8 AMOLED.\nReady for anything (and anyone)\nWhen you think about the Galaxy Watch Ultra or the Apple Watch Ultra, one thing probably comes to mind \u2014 the rugged designs. Both watches offer a who\u2019s who of durability features, from the titanium frames to the sapphire glass faces, and both come with reliable IP ratings for good measure. However, it doesn\u2019t always feel like you can separate them from the everyday Galaxy Watch and Apple Watch they\u2019re based on.\nGarmin\u2019s Fenix 8 AMOLED, on the other hand, approaches durability from the opposite side. Rather than spring for the toughest materials across the board, it acts more like it\u2019s descended from years of adventure watch experience \u2014 mainly because it is. It\u2019s like the perfect combination of the road-ready Forerunner 965 with my beloved Epix Pro 2, and it feels just right. Yes, the Fenix 8 AMOLED comes with a chunky bezel (made of either stainless steel or titanium) for protection, and yes, you can grab a version with a durable sapphire glass face, but neither feature feels like a must-have because the rest of the watch feels so locked-down and durable.\nHonestly, I kind of appreciate the reinforced polymer case, as it doesn\u2019t ring out with a metallic clang every time I hit it on something \u2014 which happens a lot. Garmin\u2019s stainless steel bezel can also attest to my clumsiness since its Slate Gray finish has a few telltale scuffs from when I wore it to my local bouldering gym. There\u2019s no actual damage to the watch, just a few flecks of shiny steel that show through as if to prove I\u2019m using the Fenix 8 AMOLED the way it was meant to be used.\nSapphire glass and titanium are optional, but the Fenix 8 AMOLED doesn't seem to need either one.\nMoving on, we can\u2019t explore Garmin\u2019s latest edition of the Fenix without mentioning its main upgrade: the optional AMOLED face. It\u2019s still not a standard feature across the entire lineup, but I\u2019ve become somewhat spoiled by Garmin\u2019s bright, crisp panel since I first used it on the Forerunner 265. Garmin used its new display as justification to introduce a whole new slate of animations, making everything from your Body Battery readout to the awards that pop up when you finish your fastest mile or longest run look just a bit more lively, and I don\u2019t see myself going back to the older, simpler Memory in Pixel (MIP) animations any time soon.\nGranted, there are probably a few battery truthers out there who would happily point out that MIP displays don\u2019t use as much power, and maybe they\u2019re right. However, the Fenix 8 AMOLED already boasts more than two weeks of juice between charges (more on this in a minute), so I\u2019m perfectly happy to stick with the brighter, more exciting panel. I might feel differently about it if there were a chance I\u2019d go weeks on end without access to a charger, but there\u2019s not, so give me all the fun, colorful animations. Now, if only Garmin could pick up the pace with optimizing some of its best watch faces for the new panel.\nAnother bright spot on the Garmin Fenix 8 AMOLED \u2014 excuse the terrible pun \u2014 is the built-in LED flashlight. It\u2019s not quite bright enough to step in for a headlamp on a nighttime run, but the two-tap activation means it\u2019s usually faster to activate than my phone flashlight if I drop something or need to fish a toy for my cats out from under the couch. And yes, I\u2019ve used the flashlight to read a menu at a bar, but I only did that once because it felt a little too silly.\nAnyway, the real reason I think the Fenix 8 AMOLED is the best \u201cUltra\u201d watch money can buy is because it\u2019s the most flexible \u2014 and it\u2019s not even close. It\u2019s not picky about what phone you pair it with \u2014 mine has spent time with both my Pixel 9 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro \u2014 and it\u2019s the only Ultra watch that lets you pick what size case you need. Unlike the Apple Watch Ultra, which comes in a single 49mm case, or the Galaxy Watch Ultra, with a single 47mm option, the Garmin Fenix 8 AMOLED offers a trio of case sizes. There\u2019s a 43mm version for users with smaller wrists, the 47mm model I\u2019ve been testing, and a larger 51mm option with a bigger battery and even more display real estate.\nI don\u2019t think I could ever use the larger Fenix 8 \u2014 even the 47mm version feels a little too big for me at times \u2014 but I have to give Garmin credit for its flexibility. I know that I\u2019m built differently from some of my closest friends who are also runners, and some of Garmin\u2019s elite ultrarunning athletes are a different breed entirely, yet there\u2019s a version of the Fenix 8 that could work for any of us.\nCan you hear me now?\nWhile I\u2019ve usually been pretty enthusiastic about my experiences with Garmin GPS watches, I\u2019ve always run into a bit of a hiccup when it comes to the actual smartwatch features. See, although I don\u2019t personally care about being able to respond to a text from my wrist (thanks, fat fingers), I know that there are people who do, which is reason enough for them to reach for a Galaxy Watch or a comparable Apple Watch. Now, the Fenix 8 AMOLED shifts that balance a little more in its favor \u2014 even if it doesn\u2019t flip things entirely.\nThe bad news is that you still can\u2019t respond to a text message from your wrist, at least not in the traditional \u201copen a keyboard and type\u201d way. However, you can respond to those messages via voice command because the Fenix 8 AMOLED finally has a microphone mounted on the side of its case. With that microphone comes support for voice assistants and the ability to take calls right from your wrist \u2014 a feature that caught me off guard at first.\nThe punchy speaker and sharp microphone make the Fenix 8 AMOLED feel much more like a smartwatch.\nSee, I\u2019m used to pressing the buttons on my watch to accept or reject a call and then grabbing my phone to start the conversation. This time, when I went to answer a FaceTime call using my Fenix 8 AMOLED, I heard my friends\u2019 voices erupting from my wrist. It was, of course, a FaceTime call, so using my wrist only covered about half of what I needed, but I quickly realized that I could do the same for standard calls, opening up a whole new avenue of communication \u2014 or eliminating running as an excuse for ignoring a phone call. Either way, the microphone brings the Fenix 8 AMOLED a step closer to competing with traditional Ultra smartwatches, and I\u2019m here for it.\nAlong with that microphone, the Fenix 8 AMOLED packs a brand-new speaker, which you might have expected me to touch on in the design section above. After all, it\u2019s another fairly standard trait among ultra-tier wearables. However, I\u2019m slotting it here because the new speaker has all-new sound effects. Everything sounds deeper and richer, from the chime when you pick up a GPS signal to the voice that announces your mile splits throughout a workout. Previously, I would have equated Garmin\u2019s notification chimes to those on a Nothing Phone \u2014 kind of harsh and screechy \u2014 so I\u2019ll take the new, deeper sounds any day.\nOutside of the microphone and speaker upgrades, the rest of Garmin\u2019s smartwatch-esque features remain mostly rock-solid. I continue to rely heavily on Garmin Pay when I\u2019m out for a long run and decide to stop for coffee, and I\u2019m glad to have a full-color weather map at my disposal, even though I\u2019m going outside for a run, no matter the conditions. If you\u2019re the type to listen to music while you work out, the Fenix 8 AMOLED packs a solid 32GB of storage, which is more than enough for a few playlists that you can manage from your wrist \u2014 just keep in mind that extra Bluetooth usage on top of GPS tracking might do a number on your battery life.\nThe heart of an adventurer\nAlthough a rugged design is usually a dead giveaway for an ultra-grade watch, and smartwatch-like features go a long way in establishing some quality of life, what matters most is how your wearable can handle the adventures you seek. More than supporting a ton of activity types (which the Fenix 8 AMOLED does), it means holding enough juice to carry you through a busy week of activity tracking. And, with a fall schedule that consisted of a weekly recreational soccer game on Monday nights, five days of marathon training per week, and an expensive climbing gym membership that I continue to try to justify, I figured I\u2019d see just how much adventure the watch could handle.\nLong story short \u2014 it can handle just about everything I could come up with. I\u2019ve had the Fenix 8 AMOLED on my wrist for a little more than a month at this point, and I\u2019ve put it through a few different workouts of everything mentioned above, and it hasn\u2019t blinked once. Not all of the workouts are worth sharing \u2014 bouldering, for example, only tracks the difficulty of each climb, my heart rate, and the time it took \u2014 but I\u2019ve logged enough of them to have a pretty good feel for the Fenix 8\u2019s heart rate and GPS accuracy.\nThe Fenix 8 AMOLED is ready for any activity, including a few dozen that you'll probably never use.\nBefore we get to my activities, though, I should probably touch on the latest version of Garmin\u2019s sleep tracking. Outside of a few shiny new animations in the Morning Report, it hasn\u2019t changed from what I was used to on the Epix Pro 2. Garmin still monitors your HRV status, can automatically detect naps (if you manage to sleep during the day), and offers a sleep coach to analyze your nightly rest and provide insights on your sleep quality. Mine has been somewhat of a mess since I returned from Europe, but I\u2019ve slowly been returning to normal \u2014 just in time for daylight savings to start. Anyway, back to the more interesting metrics.\nOf the bunch, the workout that best demonstrates what the Fenix 8 AMOLED can do is a 5K that I raced in the build-up to running the Amsterdam Marathon. Feeling adventurous, I decided to swap the race for one of my more casual Saturday runs, but I didn\u2019t want to sacrifice my weekly mileage. So, I worked it out in my head that I could jog to the start, run a hard 5K, and then jog home afterward \u2014 three separate efforts that would put the Fenix 8 under different levels of stress. There\u2019s almost nothing exciting to mention about the runs there or back (other than the fact that Garmin\u2019s Resume Later option is a lifesaver when it comes to preserving my battery), but the accuracy of the dual-band GPS during the race impressed me.\nI\u2019m not usually one to take on a 5K (I prefer longer distances), but the race offered a chance to loop through Baltimore\u2019s football and baseball stadiums without worrying about crowds, so how could I pass that up? Anyway, if you\u2019ve ever been in or around a stadium, you know that they don\u2019t make GPS tracking very easy. Something about the dense concrete and high stands makes it challenging to get a reliable lock on your location, which tends to throw off the pacing on your watch. It\u2019s the same idea as running a marathon through a crowded city like Chicago \u2014 you end up trusting the crowd rather than the watch you\u2019ve used for months.\nSo, imagine my surprise when I finished the race (which involved two tight loops around M&T Bank Stadium) and went to check out the map of my run. I figured there might be a few wobbles to the track as I went around the concourse, but I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. The Fenix 8 AMOLED nailed both laps, hugging closer to the stadium on my first loop but pushing the second loop a bit wider to account for the slower joggers and the families with strollers that I had to pass to finish.\nI also took a quick look at a few of the Fenix 8 AMOLED\u2019s other metrics, like my heart rate and my average speed, just to see if I could pick out which part of each measurement matched different segments of the race. At first, I was slightly concerned by the two matching drops in pace \u2014 downward spikes that almost resemble a vampire\u2019s fangs \u2014 until I realized that they matched a point in my loop around the stadium where I had to make a practically hairpin-sharp turn. There was no drop in heart rate to match those breaks, but I didn\u2019t expect one, given how short the turn was. The Fenix 8 AMOLED also uses the same Elevate Gen 5 heart rate sensor that the previous Fenix 7 Pro and Epix Pro 2 used, so it boasts similar accuracy to some of the watches I already trust.\nWith Garmin\u2019s GPS and heart rate prowess established, you might wonder about the battery life you can expect from the Fenix 8 AMOLED. Well, I\u2019d say it\u2019s certainly deserving of the Ultra name. Garmin claims that you can reach up to 16 days of battery life from the 47mm version, and I\u2019d agree with that assessment. As I said, I\u2019ve had my Fenix 8 for about a month now, and I\u2019ve only had to charge it twice \u2014 once after about a week because it came with less than a full charge and a second time just before I headed to Europe for a week of vacation. If you need even more juice, Garmin claims you can get 29 days of usage out of the 51mm Fenix 8, but I still don\u2019t think I\u2019d want something that large on my wrist.\nUnfortunately, one drawback to the Fenix 8 AMOLED\u2019s charging setup is that I\u2019m still tired of proprietary cables. Yes, it\u2019s good that Garmin still includes one in the box, and I\u2019m glad it switched to USB-C cables about a year ago, but I don\u2019t love that I have to travel with an extra charger whenever I have battery anxiety. Thankfully, I can usually remember to top up my charge before I go on most trips, but I also know I probably won\u2019t find someone with a Garmin charger should worse come to worse.\nGarmin Fenix 8 AMOLED review: An Ultra smartwatch without the Ultra name\nAt the end of the day, I don\u2019t know how you can ask for more from your watch than the Garmin Fenix 8 AMOLED can provide. Maybe you want the ability to type on your watch, or perhaps you\u2019d like support for a few more apps, but I don\u2019t think you can find a wearable that\u2019s more prepared for an adventure. There are still features that I\u2019m stumbling upon with the Fenix 8 AMOLED, simply because I didn\u2019t know to look for them. I didn\u2019t know to look for Garmin\u2019s Jet Lag Adviser until after I got back from Europe, but my sleep schedule probably would have thanked me had I found it sooner \u2014 at least as long as it could account for post-marathon fatigue, too.\nHowever, that\u2019s an excellent way to sum up what sets the Fenix 8 AMOLED apart from other ultra-tier watches on the market. Whereas the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and Apple Watch Ultra feel like extensions of their everyday counterparts, Garmin\u2019s latest flagship is all adventure, all the time. What it lacks in app support, it more than makes up for in battery life, operating system flexibility, and overall durability. No, you won\u2019t be able to open up Strava on your watch to deal kudos while you wait for the sun to rise, but you\u2019ll be able to use your LED flashlight to navigate past poison ivy and other hazards when nature calls.\nMaybe it's not a smartwatch like Apple or Samsung would make, but the Fenix 8 AMOLED is an adventure watch that only Garmin could come up with.\nIn my eyes, that\u2019s what an adventure watch should be \u2014 it should make life easier while you\u2019re off the grid, but it doesn\u2019t have to act like an extension of your smartphone while doing so. If I\u2019m out for a hike, a trail run, or another flavor of Type B fun, I\u2019d much rather stay focused on my experience than worry about whatever notifications my phone wants to share with me.\nAnd yet, I know that some people will take one look at the Garmin Fenix 8 AMOLED and go right back to their Apple Watch Ultra ($759.99 at eBay) or Galaxy Watch Ultra ($649.99 at Amazon). I know that the Fenix 8 AMOLED is the most expensive of the three \u2014 by a decent margin \u2014 and doesn\u2019t offer exclusive features like Apple and Samsung\u2019s top-end wearables do. If you\u2019re a dedicated iPhone user, you\u2019ll probably gravitate toward the Apple Watch Ultra\u2019s seamless integration with Siri or the Walkie-Talkie mode that only works with other Apple Watches. You\u2019ll probably love the same square interface that every Apple Watch has used since the start, and you\u2019ll happily build up a new collection of bands for the extra-large connectors.\nLikewise, Galaxy users will probably reach for Samsung\u2019s first attempt at an Ultra watch. Maybe the squircle design reminds me too much of an Apple Watch, but that\u2019s what happens when Apple has a little more practice with its design. If not the Galaxy Watch Ultra, you might even go for the slightly older Galaxy Watch 5 Pro, which offers a tighter mix of adventurous features while still looking like a watch you can wear every day.\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with any of those options \u2014 all three are reliable watches in their own right \u2014 but if you\u2019re in for an adventure, I think the Garmin Fenix 8 AMOLED is the best watch to guide you along the way.\nThank you for being part of our community.

Learn more.\nPOLED vs AMOLED: What is the difference between these OLED technologies?\nMarch 9, 2025\nFrom TVs to smartphones, OLED displays have become increasingly common and accessible over the past few years. That\u2019s especially true in the portable electronics market. While OLED was once reserved for premium devices, you\u2019ll now find the technology at every price point. Not every OLED display is equal, though \u2014 differences in materials and manufacturing processes can result in varying display qualities. So in this article, let\u2019s understand how POLED differs vs AMOLED, and what these acronyms mean in the real world.\nPOLED and AMOLED are simply two different types of OLED displays, primarily made by LG and Samsung Display respectively. The P in POLED refers to the use of a plastic substrate, while the AM in AMOLED stands for Active Matrix.\nHowever, all modern OLED displays use a plastic substrate and active matrix technology these days. So whether your smartphone has a POLED or AMOLED screen, you're unlikely to notice much of a difference. Keep reading for more details.\nJUMP TO KEY SECTIONS\nThe basics of OLED technology\nBefore we can discuss the difference between POLED and AMOLED, it\u2019s worth understanding how OLED displays work in general. To that end, let\u2019s ignore the P and AM prefixes for now.\nAn OLED panel consists of millions of organic light-emitting diodes. These are tiny little components that light up when current is applied to them.\nOne of the key benefits of OLED over conventional LCDs is that individual light emitters can be switched completely off.\nIf you look at an OLED display under a microscope, you\u2019ll see these diodes arranged in various red, green, and blue configurations in order to produce a full range of colors. OLED has a key advantage over conventional LCDs \u2014 individual light emitters can be switched completely off. This gives OLED deep blacks and an excellent contrast ratio.\nNaturally, light emitters in an OLED display need a power source in order to function. Manufacturers can use either a passive wiring matrix or an active wiring matrix. Passive matrix displays provide current to an entire row of LEDs, which isn\u2019t ideal but it is cheap. An active matrix, on the other hand, introduces a capacitor and thin-film transistor (TFT) network that allows each pixel to be driven individually. This driving matrix is part of the panel that sits on top of a base substrate.\nOLED vs AMOLED: Is there a difference?\nToday, virtually all smartphone OLED displays use active-matrix technology. This is because a passive matrix requires higher voltages the more pixels you introduce. High voltage reduces LED lifetimes, making a passive matrix OLED impractical.\nAMOLED simply refers to an Active Matrix OLED panel. The AMOLED branding has become synonymous with Samsung Display\u2019s OLED panels over the years. However, all smartphone OLED panels, including those from Samsung\u2019s rivals like LG Display use active-matrix technology too \u2014 they just aren\u2019t marketed as such.\nIn case you\u2019re wondering what Super AMOLED means, it\u2019s another bit of branding to indicate the presence of an embedded touch-sensitive layer. Similarly, Dynamic AMOLED refers to a display with HDR capabilities, specifically support for Samsung\u2019s favored HDR10+ standard.\nPlastic substrates: Putting the P in POLED\nNow that we know the layered structure of an OLED display, we can move on to the plastic part. While the first wave of OLED panels was built using glass substrates, the desire for more interesting form factors has seen manufacturers use more flexible plastic components. This is where the P in POLED comes from.\nGlass is fixed and rigid, while plastic substrates can be more easily formed into new shapes. This property is absolutely essential for curved screens as well as foldable devices like Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Fold series. Working with plastics is also much more cost-effective than glass.\nJust as AMOLED has become synonymous with Samsung\u2019s OLED panels, LG Display uses POLED as its branding of choice.\nManufacturers have experimented with a range of plastics for flexible displays, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN). OLED manufacturers have settled on using polyimide plastics (PI) that can better withstand high TFT manufacturing temperatures. The type of substrate and heating process used also defines the flexibility of the display.\nThe somewhat confusing part is that Samsung\u2019s AMOLED displays use plastic substrates. And as the name suggests, LG Display\u2019s POLED technology clearly uses plastic as well. In summary, it\u2019s absolutely possible to build a plastic substrate, active-matrix OLED panel. That\u2019s exactly what both of the big two panel manufacturers are doing when it comes to mobile displays.\nPOLED vs AMOLED: Other panel differences\nEven though LG and Samsung-made OLED panels qualify as both POLED and AMOLED simultaneously, the companies aren\u2019t exactly producing identical panels. The quality of the TFT layer and plastic compound can make a difference to display performance, as can the type of emitters and sub-pixel layout.\nDifferent color LEDs offer different brightnesses and shelf life. Blue emitters, for example, degrade the quickest. Panel manufacturers can therefore opt to use different LED materials \u2014 such as small-molecule, polymer, or phosphorescent \u2014 to optimize their designs. This may also necessitate different subpixel layouts in order to balance the panel white point, color gamut, and resolution.\nBetween peak brightness, color gamut, and subpixel layouts, there can be a range of differences even between panels of the same type.\nOver the years, we\u2019ve seen OLED display manufacturers converge on a set of standard parameters. For example, both LG and Samsung use a diamond PenTile sub-pixel layout for smartphone displays. This just means that both should offer similar long-term reliability.\nEven when it comes to other attributes like power consumption, brightness, low brightness performance, and panel uniformity, it\u2019s unclear if one has an upper hand. That said, most smartphone makers \u2014 from Apple to OnePlus \u2014 turn to Samsung\u2019s AMOLED panels for their flagship devices. However, we still see a handful of phones release with P-OLED panels every year.\nPOLED vs AMOLED: Which is better?\nIn the past, LG used POLED displays in its own flagship smartphones like the Velvet and Wing. However, these panels fell slightly short of the competition in certain aspects like peak brightness and color gamut coverage. These shortfalls led to speculations that Samsung has a leg up over the competition, but the accuracy of these claims is anyone\u2019s guess. Both Samsung and LG have come a long way since then.\nSo does that mean you should avoid POLED? Not quite \u2014 it\u2019s still fundamentally OLED technology, which offers numerous advantages over IPS LCD. You\u2019ll mostly find POLED displays in mid-range and budget smartphones these days, where they should have no problem matching Samsung\u2019s own lower-end AMOLED panels. As a relatively smaller player, LG may also offer more competitive pricing as compared to Samsung. And that may even make POLED viable sub-flagship smartphones trying to cut costs.\nSamsung\u2019s AMOLED panels feature in the vast majority of flagship smartphones today. POLED is making a comeback in the mid-range market.\nFor most consumers, the choice between POLED vs AMOLED will be of little consequence. The underlying principle \u2014 an active-matrix OLED on a flexible plastic substrate \u2014 applies equally to both, after all. Despite the different names, LG Display and Samsung aren\u2019t worlds apart in their approach to producing OLED panels for smartphones. You should practically never have to make a smartphone purchasing decision based on the pOLED vs AMOLED spec debate alone.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nCoros just made my new favorite heart rate monitor\nAugust 22, 2023\nAs an avid runner, I\u2019m no stranger to heart rate monitors and extra sensors. I\u2019m all about getting every last little piece of data to figure out if I actually nailed my workout or if I pushed just a little bit too hard. Usually, that means slipping on my Polar H10 chest strap, but some days I dread wetting the electrodes (like, all winter long), and it can be a pain to keep the band comfortably in position. Now, I don\u2019t have to worry about that anymore. Coros is challenging Polar with a heart rate monitor of its own, and it\u2019s my new favorite running accessory.\nSun\u2019s out, guns out\nThe best running gadgets are those you don\u2019t have to think about \u2014 that\u2019s why I love bone conduction headphones so much. I slip them on and forget they\u2019re there. The Coros Heart Rate Monitor falls into the same category. Unlike the Polar H10 chest strap, for example, which you have to get wet and strap around your torso before you get dressed, you can slip the Coros heart rate monitor on your arm as you head out the door. I can leave it next to my apartment key and grab both as I get ready for my warmup. Maybe I\u2019ll change my tune as the colder weather rolls around, and I have to grab the heart rate monitor before putting on a long-sleeve layer, but simplicity is bliss for now.\nAdjusting the Coros heart rate monitor is a breeze, too. It uses a combination of hook and loop and an adjustable buckle, so you only have to size the band once. As far as I can tell, it doesn\u2019t matter how you\u2019re built, either. I\u2019m no John Cena, and I\u2019ve had no problems with the heart rate monitor sliding up or down my arm. You do have to make sure it\u2019s tight on your bicep, but not uncomfortably so. My Polar H10, on the other hand, tries its very best to slip down mid-run, leaving me adjusting when I should be focusing on hitting interval paces.\nThere's no room for claustrophobia with Coros' simple, comfortable bicep band.\nThe other challenge with Polar\u2019s chest strap design is that it often leaves me feeling claustrophobic. If I size it for my chest when breathing normally, it feels like I\u2019m a watermelon wrapped in rubber bands once I\u2019m breathing heavily. Yet, if I size it to account for my heavier breathing, it\u2019s far too loose when I\u2019m warming up before my main run. There\u2019s no such issue with Coros\u2019 bicep strap. It\u2019s far more comfortable than (and not nearly as tight as) a blood pressure cuff, and you\u2019ll probably forget the heart rate monitor is there unless it\u2019s arm day at the gym.\nIf there\u2019s one drawback to the bicep positioning of the Coros Heart Rate Monitor, well, it\u2019s the fact that I now have one more weird tan line from running. I have a sock tan, a watch tan, a classic farmer\u2019s tan, and now a pale strip around my right bicep. It\u2019s not a big deal \u2014 I\u2019m used to the perils of odd running tans \u2014 but it might be something to consider if you like to go sleeveless.\nKeep it simple, stupid\nSticking with simplicity, the Coros Heart Rate Monitor doesn\u2019t even have buttons. Instead, it uses automatic wear detection to turn on and off when it senses contact with your skin. Thanks to a small, green LED on the side of the case, you\u2019ll always know when the heart rate monitor is active. The detection is pretty quick, too \u2014 I pressed the sensor against my thumb to test it, and the LED lit up after about a second, with the optical heart rate lights following about a second after that.\nThat\u2019s right, the Coros Heart Rate Monitor is an optical heart rate sensor. Essentially, that means it\u2019s not much different from wearing a Coros or Garmin GPS watch wrapped around your bicep, only this one doesn\u2019t have to worry about tracking your location at the same time. The optical approach isn\u2019t quite as premium as Polar\u2019s ECG-based H10, which uses your heart\u2019s electricity (thus the wetting of electrodes), but most users won\u2019t notice a significant difference.\nCoros' optical sensor is right there with Polar's ECG-powered H10, but it's much smaller and lighter.\nIf you\u2019re trying to keep an eye on your heart rate because you expect an irregularity, you\u2019ll probably want an ECG model, but Coros\u2019 optical sensor is spot-on for watching your heart rate progression through a workout. As a true data nerd, I strapped the Polar H10 around my chest and paired it to my Garmin Forerunner 965 on one wrist, then strapped the Coros Heart Rate Monitor and my Garmin Enduro 2 on the other wrist. Both setups returned almost identical readouts on a nice, easy four-mile effort as I work my way toward a fall race.\nOne more reminder \u2014 you don\u2019t have to get the Coros Heart Rate Monitor wet to make it work. I can\u2019t put into words how much I dread wetting the Polar H10 on a cold winter\u2019s morning, even if I use warm water. Sure, I\u2019ll probably still sweat to the point where a little water doesn\u2019t matter, but it doesn\u2019t make the chill any easier.\nMentioning connections, the Coros Heart Rate Monitor offers just enough options for the well-accessorized runner. It can connect to three devices at once via Bluetooth Smart, meaning that you could set the heart rate monitor up with a GPS watch and Zwift at the same time with room for one more sensor left over. So far, I\u2019ve paired the heart rate monitor to a few different Garmin models with no troubles \u2014 just head to the sensors menu on your watch and select it from the list of devices. Unfortunately, Coros picked a chipset without ANT+ capabilities, which may or may not matter to you depending on how many accessories you have, but I didn\u2019t notice any issues when paired with just one GPS watch.\nRunnin\u2019, runnin\u2019, and runnin\u2019, runnin\u2019\nBattery life is typically a calling card for Coros, and its heart rate monitor is no exception. In fact, I bought my Coros Pace 2 a few years back simply because it had three weeks of juice at a $200 price point. With the Heart Rate Monitor, Coros claims that you can get about 38 hours of continuous tracking per charge, and, well, I can\u2019t disagree yet. I haven\u2019t touched the included charger outside of a quick charge while setting up the heart rate monitor a few weeks ago. Granted, I haven\u2019t run a total of 38 hours during my time with the strap, but the fewer charges, the better.\nWhat I\u2019m not so thrilled with is the heart rate monitor\u2019s proprietary charging cable. It\u2019s not a surprising decision \u2014 most fitness wearables companies have their own connectors \u2014 but my headache comes from the fact that it\u2019s not the same cable that Coros uses for its watches. If you\u2019re heading on vacation and worried about battery life for both your heart rate strap and Coros watch, you\u2019ll need two separate cables, both with USB-A connectors. That said, you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about your charge \u2014 active or standby \u2014 thanks to roughly 80 days of standby time from the monitor. I\u2019d like Coros to pick one cable for all its accessories and stick with it.\nA workweek's worth of battery life more than makes up for the lack of a power button.\nThe only real drawback to Coros\u2019 buttonless design is, well, there\u2019s no way to turn the Heart Rate Monitor off while still wearing it. If you finish a run and you\u2019re enjoying a coffee with your running buddies, the strap keeps reading until you take it off. It\u2019s again not a problem in the warmer months \u2014 slip the Coros Heart Rate Monitor off and hang onto it \u2014 but you can bet I\u2019m not fishing it off under a long sleeve shirt when it\u2019s freezing cold outside. We\u2019ll see how much this speeds up the frequency of charging the heart rate monitor, but I\u2019d rather stay warm than fully charged.\nAt the end of the day, minor quirks aren\u2019t enough to keep me away. I\u2019m happy to deal with a little extra passive battery drain and accuracy almost identical to the Polar H10 if it\u2019s easier to get the heart rate monitor on and off. Coros gets a lot right with its first standalone heart rate monitor, and the fact that you can pair it to just about any old GPS watch makes the simple setup even better.\nCoros Heart Rate Monitor review: FAQs\nThe Coros Heart Rate Monitor is similar to a fitness tracker that you wear around your arm. It uses the same green light array to measure your pulse, so the tighter you fit the band, the more accurate it will be.\nTechnically, yes, the Coros Heart Rate Monitor is equipped to detect heart palpitations. However, it must be connected to a smartwatch or other wearable to transmit the data.\nYes, you can connect the Coros Heart Rate Monitor to up to three devices at a time via Bluetooth.\nYes, you can use the Coros Heart Rate Monitor with non-Coros watches like those from Garmin. You can add it through the sensors menu on your watch.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nGarmin's Morning and Evening Reports are so good that Fitbit should steal them\nJuly 18, 2025\nI\u2019ve always believed that more is better when it comes to health-tracking metrics. If I\u2019m wearing a GPS watch all day and all night, I want to know what it\u2019s picking up and how I can best use that to my advantage. And when I always have a Garmin on my wrist, I know exactly how much data I have to look forward to.\nI know that I can tap into a Morning and an Evening Report on my Forerunner 970, and I\u2019ve noticed that it\u2019s made a few of my colleagues jealous. They have to watch as I check in on my steps, recovery, and upcoming workouts while they try to find their Morning Briefs that may or may not have populated. Since I know they\u2019re not about to go out and buy Garmin watches themselves, I guess it\u2019s time for Google to play copycat, and here\u2019s why.\nGarmin\u2019s strength is in its consistency\nI know my colleagues love their Fitbits and their Pixel Watches \u2014 I like the Pixel Watch an awful lot, too. If I could get Garmin-level battery life out of its smooth, pebble-like design, I\u2019d probably strap it on as my day-to-day wearable whenever I\u2019m not running. However, I\u2019ve also listened to them lament the same few issues over and over, usually surrounding the Morning Brief. Whether it\u2019s a lack of data or a brief that\u2019s flat-out missing in action, it always seems like something\u2019s not quite right.\nWith Garmin, though, I know that my Morning and Evening reports are coming, whether I\u2019ve been wearing my watch or not. Yes, they\u2019re much more detailed if I\u2019ve been wearing my Forerunner 970, adding a breakdown of my sleep and my recovery from a previous workout, but I still get a look at the weather, my upcoming workouts, and any calendar appointments I have to be on top of. If I\u2019ve been wearing my watch, it\u2019ll offer a much more detailed look at my HRV from the night before, a better recap of my training readiness, and might modify my recommended workout to account for residual fatigue.\nMy dual Garmin reports wake me up and send me to bed with a better idea of my day.\nThen, when it\u2019s almost time for bed, it\u2019s a case of same, same but different in the evening report. Instead of forecasting your day, it summarizes your activities and an estimate of just how much sleep you might need to get your Body Battery back on schedule. The evening report can also give you workout suggestions for the next day, including runs and bike rides, but if you\u2019re in the middle of a Connect Plus-powered training plan (like I am), it will default to what\u2019s on your schedule instead.\nPerhaps what I like best about Garmin\u2019s pair of reports is what I\u2019ve hinted at already \u2014 like death, taxes, and the mailman, the reports always come in. As far as I\u2019ve noticed, the Morning Report is ready a little bit before your scheduled wake-up time (in my case, around 7:00 AM), and it sticks around for about two hours after you\u2019ve rolled out of bed. You can miss it if you\u2019re not careful, but it\u2019s much easier to check than I\u2019ve heard about Fitbit\u2019s Morning Brief.\nThe Evening Report gives you a similar window, popping up on your wrist about 90 minutes before your scheduled bedtime. Typically, that means I\u2019m getting a reminder around 9:30 PM, which is also a pretty good reminder to wind down from my phone (or TV) for the night \u2014 even if I don\u2019t actually listen. I\u2019d be slightly curious to see whether Garmin\u2019s Evening Report would change if it knew I was spending the night out with friends or staying up late watching a movie, but that\u2019s usually reflected in the next day\u2019s morning report anyway.\nI know Google could do this, but, weirdly, it hasn\u2019t\nYes, I know that Google has its Fitbit-powered Morning Brief. I\u2019ve heard about it plenty from my colleagues, and they\u2019ve said over and over again how much they\u2019d like to use it, but that it\u2019s just not consistent enough. That\u2019s the part of this whole thing that I don\u2019t understand. I trust my set of Nest Hubs and speakers to manage routines like the lights and temperature of my apartment, I trust my Pixel 9 Pro to know when I get home, and I trust my Pixel Buds Pro to connect to the correct device, why can\u2019t I trust my watch to give me a morning report at a consistent time?\nTiming aside, I\u2019m just as surprised by the information that Google\u2019s Morning Brief doesn\u2019t include. As Kaitlyn pointed out, it doesn\u2019t include calendar appointments or a detailed weather forecast, which are odd considering I trust Google Calendar with my life (basically) and Pixel Weather with my well-being (keeping me dry when I set off for a run). It feels like Google could add \u2014 or rather expand \u2014 both metrics within its Morning Brief without too much work and offer a much more complete look at my day.\nGoogle has my data, now if only it would give some back to me in an easily digestible way.\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, and perhaps I\u2019m too data-happy regarding Google, but I can\u2019t say the current Morning Brief makes much sense. It\u2019s being outdone by a Morning Report from a fitness company in terms of both regularity and detail, and Garmin\u2019s Evening Report is just the icing on top. Unfortunately, it\u2019s currently limited to just the Forerunner 570 and Forerunner 970, but I can easily see Garmin expanding its access shortly since neither wearable has any special hardware to support the brief.\nRight now, my money is on Garmin rolling its Evening Report out to its entire lineup before Google bulks up its Brief, but that\u2019s just my guess. For my colleagues\u2019 sake, I hope I\u2019m wrong.\nTons of tracking metrics\nDurable titanium bezel\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

Learn more.\nGarmin makes the best smartwatches that I can't wear every day\nApril 16, 2025\nWith a diverse range of powerful watches, Garmin earns a top spot in the wearables market. As a fitness enthusiast, I absolutely love Garmin\u2019s entire lineup, from the Fenix 8 to the Vivoactive 6. The company\u2019s lifestyle smartwatch, the Venu 3, offers fantastic heart rate and GPS accuracy, and a wealth of performance metrics. But despite its impressive features, I can\u2019t bring myself to wear one every day. If you\u2019re all about health and fitness, Garmin\u2019s perfect. But if you need a smartwatch that handles everything, well, Garmin ain\u2019t it.\nDo you use the Garmin Venu 3 as your daily watch?\nThe power of Garmin\u2019s devices\nFirst things first \u2014 Garmin\u2019s devices are virtually unrivaled when it comes to fitness tracking. While Wear OS and Apple smartwatches continue to catch up, Garmin still leads in accuracy and advanced metrics. The Venu 3 stands out with features like Body Battery, Health Snapshot, Fitness Age, and extensive sports tracking. It also offers customization options for workout data screens and niche tools like cycling power meter support.\nThen there\u2019s its accuracy. The Venu 3\u2019s GPS and heart rate sensors are spot on. Whether I\u2019m running trails (okay, walking), cycling urban areas, or tracking my daily coffee commute, Garmin\u2019s GPS reliability is rock-solid. In fact, during my review, it even outperformed some multi-band watches. The heart rate sensor is just as consistent, matching the accuracy of my dedicated heart rate strap. This reliable sensor is the pillar of several of Garmin\u2019s most useful offerings, including detailed activity and sleep tracking, plus more advanced training tools like HRV tracking and Recovery.\nThe Garmin Venu 3's GPS and heart rate sensors offer spot-on accuracy.\nAnother standout is the Venu 3\u2019s battery life. Garmin devices are known for lasting days (or even weeks) on a single charge, and the Venu 3 is no exception. Even with its 1.4-inch AMOLED touchscreen display, the watch features a 14-day battery life. In my experience, it lasts about four days with heavy use, including GPS tracking. That\u2019s impressive, especially when compared to the demoralizing daily charging cycle of many other smartwatches (cough, Apple Watch). With all the time it spends on my wrist, the Venu 3\u2019s durability also deserves recognition. With a stainless steel bezel and water resistance up to five meters, it still looks as pristine as the day I got it.\nGarmin\u2019s greater ecosystem\nThe Venu 3\u2019s hardware and on-device tools are impressive, but Garmin doesn\u2019t stop there. The Garmin Connect app is another reason I lean into the brand. It\u2019s packed with stats yet somehow streamlined, so I never feel overwhelmed or lacking in data. From tracking workouts and analyzing sleep to monitoring training and recovery, Garmin has it figured out. Recently, they launched Garmin Connect Plus, which takes things up a notch with personalized training plans and deeper insights. I wasn\u2019t pretty disappointed to see a subscription fee, but I\u2019m always excited when a brand develops more tools and features.\nFinally, Garmin Coach is a game-changer for me. After a recent fitness hiatus, I\u2019m more interested than ever in custom training plans tailored to my abilities. I\u2019ve utilized the running coach as well as the newer Strength training option. As I improve, Garmin Coach plans adapt, keeping me on track to crush my goals while taking the mental load off my shoulders.\nSmart features behind the curve\nYet, while I could go on and on about my love for Garmin, the Venu 3 will never be my daily driver. The device falls far too short in smart features, especially for anyone used to an Apple, Pixel, or Samsung Galaxy watch.\nCompared to Apple and Wear OS smartwatches, the Venu 3 lacks third-party app support and smart features.\nFor one, third-party app compatibility is extremely limited. You won\u2019t find the massive selection of apps you get on other smartwatches, especially Apple, and the ones you do find don\u2019t offer the same integration you\u2019ll get on Wear OS or Apple. I can download a Spotify app from the IQ store, for example, but its functionality is limited. I can\u2019t add Audible for long walks, an app I use regularly on my other watches. The Venu 3 also doesn\u2019t offer access to most of the productivity tools I rely on or any of Google\u2019s suite.\nThe Venu 3 can tap into my phone\u2019s voice assistant, but Garmin doesn\u2019t have its own fully integrated assistant like Google Assistant or Siri. When it comes to notifications, the Venu 3 keeps things simple. You get alerts for calls, messages, and apps, but only Android users can type responses to texts or view photos on the device. You can take calls via Bluetooth, but there\u2019s no LTE variant available. These shortcomings aren\u2019t dealbreakers for fitness enthusiasts, but if you\u2019re after a fully connected smartwatch, you\u2019re better off looking elsewhere. Or, if you\u2019re me, swapping between watches and occasionally dual-wristing during workouts.\nIn short, the Venu 3 is primarily a tracker, not a smartphone companion, and the device integration synchronization just isn\u2019t there. I treat my wearables as a satellite campus to the university of my smartphone. I rely on both devices to house all the tools I need and many of those are third-party apps.\nBest for athletics, but not everyday wear\nGarmin makes the best smartwatches for athletes. Period. Their focus on fitness tracking, accuracy, and durability is unmatched, and if you\u2019re someone who needs a watch that can handle all your workouts, outdoor adventures, and long-term training goals, you won\u2019t find anything better. But if you want a device that can handle both fitness and all the typical smartwatch features\u2014notifications, apps, and voice assistants\u2014then Garmin isn\u2019t quite there yet. For fitness lovers, Garmin is a no-brainer, but for those like me who want a little more smart functionality, you\u2019ll need to look elsewhere.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nGarmin Forerunner 965 review: AMOLED excellence\nMay 5, 2023\nGarmin Forerunner 965\nWhat we like\nWhat we don't like\nGarmin Forerunner 965\nGarmin has never been one for annual updates. Or iterative ones, for that matter. It waited three years between launching the Forerunner 945 and the 955, taking time to refine its sensors and improve its battery life. Now, it\u2019s speeding things up a bit. Just nine months after the arrival of the Forerunner 955, its successor arrived. The Garmin Forerunner 965 hopes to cement the series\u2019 place among the best smartwatches for runners with a vibrant AMOLED display and some premium new materials. Find out more in our Garmin Forerunner 965 review.\nGarmin Forerunner 965 review: What you need to know\n- Garmin Forerunner 965: $599 / \u00a3599 / \u20ac649\nGarmin announced its premium new Forerunner 965 running watch alongside its mid-range Forerunner 265 in early March 2023. It succeeds the Forerunner 955 and 955 Solar nine months after their introduction and brings a crisp AMOLED touchscreen to an otherwise familiar design.\nUnlike the previous Garmin Forerunner 955 and 955 Solar duo, there\u2019s only one version of the Forerunner 965. That means you won\u2019t have the option of a solar charging ring, but it also means the only choice you have to make is which colorway you prefer. The Garmin Forerunner 965 comes with a titanium bezel on all three colors, so it\u2019s up to you whether you want Whitestone, Black and Powder Gray, or Black and Amp Yellow. We tested the Whitestone version with a matching 22mm Whitestone band.\nIn addition to the new titanium bezel, the Forerunner 965 sports a 1.4-inch Gorilla Glass 3 DX display with a 454 x 454 resolution. The overall case measures 47.2mm x 47.2mm and comes sized to fit wrists from 135mm to 205mm. Garmin\u2019s latest premium running watch is lightweight at just 53g, and the 5ATM water resistance rating ensures you can dive to depths of up to 50 meters before sustaining any water damage.\nWhile the extensive sensors are unchanged, Garmin's new AMOLED face brings a serious shine to its premium running watch.\nLike its predecessor, the Garmin Forerunner 965 offers 32GB of onboard storage to download music, podcasts, and additional maps \u2014 including golf courses. Although you can store your music, there\u2019s no speaker on the Forerunner 965, so you\u2019ll have to pair Bluetooth headphones for playback. You get an NFC chip for wireless payments through Garmin Pay, which is standard across the Forerunner lineup.\nAs for sensors, the Garmin Forerunner 965 remains largely the same as the previous Forerunner 955. It packs a reliable suite of sensors, including multi-band GNSS, SatIQ technology, and Garmin\u2019s Training Readiness tool. The Forerunner 965 also has fitness tracking and health metrics like heart rate, Pulse Ox, and Body Battery, which tells you how well you\u2019ve recovered (or how much effort you\u2019ve expended) throughout the day. Other sensors include a compass, gyroscope, barometric altimeter, and thermometer.\nWhat sets the Forerunner 965 apart from its mid-range Forerunner 265 counterpart, however, is its in-depth mapping features. It comes loaded with full-color support, differentiating roads, parks, and houses for easy navigation. The Forerunner 965 also supports trail maps, enabling you to retrace your steps should you wander off the beaten path.\nThe Forerunner 965 did receive a price bump as part of its facelift, with all models now costing $599. This was previously the cost for the Solar model, with the base version coming in at $499. All three colorways offer the same features, and you can pick up the Garmin Forerunner 965 directly from Garmin.\nWhat I like about the Garmin Forerunner 965\nThe best thing about the Garmin Forerunner 965 \u2014 and the thing that sets it apart from the Forerunner 265 \u2014 is its mapping. I\u2019ve been putting in plenty of offroad miles to put the Forerunner 965 through its paces, both on low-impact hikes and on twisty, technical trail runs. Being blessed with an internal compass that works like a broken clock, I\u2019ve toggled to the Forerunner 965\u2019s map display more times than I\u2019d like to count.\nGranted, the image above doesn\u2019t show me completely lost \u2014 it\u2019s more for illustration since I rarely stop to take a photo when I\u2019m bushwhacking to find a trail. However, it\u2019s a perfect illustration of the Forerunner 965\u2019s capabilities. Roads are neatly labeled, as are streams, and there\u2019s always a bright red arrow pointing north. The Forerunner 965 also gives you a handy heads-up as to the next turn on your route if you come to a fork and aren\u2019t sure which way to go.\nAlmost as important as saving my bacon from a wrong turn, the Forerunner 965 can generate turn-by-turn running routes if you\u2019re up for some exploration. I often fall into the same reliable five-mile jaunt, so the generated routes have been a great way to explore my hometown while sticking to a comfortable distance. You can select the length of your run, anywhere from one to 100 miles, and Garmin handles the rest.\nGarmin's mapping features are more than worth the price of entry if you're directionally challenged like I am.\nOf course, you won\u2019t be able to appreciate the maps \u2014 or any of Garmin\u2019s countless workout types \u2014 without first acknowledging the Forerunner 965\u2019s brand-new AMOLED touchscreen. It\u2019s a tenth of an inch larger than the Forerunner 955\u2019s display, but the gap in quality is massive. Garmin\u2019s AMOLED is bright with punchy colors, and the new panel introduces animations throughout the software. For example, the Morning Report now displays a steaming cup of coffee (or tea) before diving into your sleep recap and Body Battery. It\u2019s much easier to lift your wrist and pick out your heart rate or distance while running, but the overall interface is exactly the same as on previous Forerunner models, so there\u2019s no learning curve.\nWith that upgraded display, you might expect the Forerunner 965\u2019s battery performance to take a hit. It\u2019s true, it\u2019s not quite as stellar as the Forerunner 955 Solar, but I\u2019ve only had to charge the newer watch once during my testing period, and that was two or three days ago. It\u2019s had no problems balancing life in smartwatch mode with trail runs, hikes, yoga practices (yes, Garmin has a yoga mode), and standard road runs. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but I\u2019m happy to trade charging every three weeks for charging every two and a half weeks, given the massively improved display. Granted, I skipped Garmin\u2019s optional always-on setting, as the watch lights up with no problem when I bring it in front of my face. If you toggle the always-on display, the battery life will drop to about seven days between charges.\nGarmin\u2019s five-button navigation has grown on me over time, but I\u2019m glad to see the Forerunner 965 stick to a combination of buttons and a touchscreen. I tend to sweat heavily, making the touchscreen a no-go while running, but some might prefer the relative simplicity. Five buttons might still be more than you need on a watch, but it\u2019s easy to get used to them, and the much larger Start/Stop button is easy to find without looking for it.\nThe Forerunner 965\u2019s titanium bezel is another classy, if subtle, upgrade. It adds a little extra peace of mind knowing that you can spend a day rock climbing or take a tumble while on a hike and you won\u2019t pick up scratches or scrapes. By the way, if you take a tumble, I can attest to the speed of Garmin\u2019s fall detection \u2014 I had a few close calls during a marathon with a previous watch, and it kicks in almost instantly. Back to the styling, I prefer the slightly darker titanium finish on the Black and Powder Gray model, but the durability is there all the same.\nThe Forerunner 965's titanium bezel is a classy, if subtle, upgrade.\nRounding out Garmin\u2019s premium configuration, it\u2019s great to see 32GB of storage return for all of your music and mapping needs. It\u2019s not warm enough for golf here in Pennsylvania yet, but all of my local courses are available to download, and I plan to do just that in the coming months. I\u2019ve also downloaded a few playlists to stream through my Shokz OpenRun Pro headphones on days I can\u2019t be bothered to bring my phone along.\nWith Garmin limiting the Forerunner 965\u2019s upgrades to the new AMOLED panel, there\u2019s one thing I knew I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about \u2014 the sensors. Unlike the Forerunner 265, the premium Forerunner 965 didn\u2019t have to gain any features because it already had them all. Garmin\u2019s Training Readiness metric is one of its newest, allowing you to see just how prepared you are for an upcoming workout or if you should probably take a rest day instead. The Elevate heart rate sensor is spot-on, too, easily keeping pace with my trusty Polar H10 heart rate sensor, which I keep with my Coros Pace 2 watch.\nGarmin\u2019s GPS accuracy is perhaps just as important as its heart rate accuracy, so I went into my review with high expectations. After all, if I was going to risk getting lost on a hike or a trail run, I at least wanted to make sure I could follow my breadcrumbs back to the car. As you can see on the map above, the GPS accuracy is no problem. I took the Forerunner 965 on an ill-advised (highly technical, twisty singletrack) trail run in a Maryland state park, and my path stayed all but locked onto the trail the entire time. The Forerunner 965 syncs seamlessly with Strava, meaning you can import community-created routes if you want to take your own shot at my twisty trail.\nThere are a few spots where it deviated towards the right of the map, but that\u2019s likely due to an inaccuracy on the map\u2019s part. My GPS route follows almost the same line, going out and coming back, so I\u2019m guessing the difference is due to the natural growth surrounding the trail.\nWhat I don\u2019t like about the Garmin Forerunner 965\nHunting for flaws on the Garmin Forerunner 965 is no easier than it was on the Forerunner 955. I compared that watch to buying a Ferrari and then complaining about your color options, and the same pretty much holds true here. Garmin\u2019s bright, shiny display makes everything more vibrant and eye-catching, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily fix any of the minor points from the last time around.\nThat means, above all else, that Garmin\u2019s proprietary charging cables continue strong and steady into 2023. The four-pin design is exactly the same as it\u2019s always been, and there\u2019s not a sniff of wireless charging support. Yes, the Forerunner 965 finally comes with a USB-C cable rather than USB-A, but the relatively minor update would have been the perfect time to introduce Qi charging to the fitness lineup. We\u2019ve already seen Garmin take small steps into wireless charging with the vivomove Trend, and bringing it to the premium Forerunner would have made the update feel a little less iterative.\nWith no solar option and still no wireless charging, you're only option is the Forerunner 965's proprietary charger.\nAdding onto the charging setup, the Garmin Forerunner 965 no longer has a solar option. Granted, not everyone wants to spend an extra $100 on an already expensive running watch, but the solar ring was one of my favorite features. It stretched the battery life for a few extra days, and it also felt like I was rewarding myself for spending more time in the sun. Of course, it\u2019s been replaced by the premium titanium bezel and AMOLED display, but a solar option would have been nice for a little extra battery power.\nAlso, like the Forerunner 955, Garmin continues to ignore the convenience of quick-release bands on the Forerunner 965. It\u2019s particularly confusing because some of the company\u2019s more affordable models, like the Forerunner 265, do include quick-release bands. Instead, the Forerunner 965 asks you to do a little extra work with a flathead screwdriver to customize what should be an easy swap. On the bright side, the watch uses 22mm bands, so you can continue to cycle through previous watch bands if you already have them.\nI\u2019ve also noticed that the Garmin Forerunner 965 comes with a fraction of the watch faces that its predecessor had. With the Forerunner 955, you could use Garmin\u2019s Connect IQ store to download designs from the community, but that no longer appears to be an option, with the Forerunner 965 limited to about a dozen onboard faces.\nThe downside to Garmin leaving its sensors unchanged is that we still have a few lingering issues from the Forerunner 955. For starters, there\u2019s no ECG capability due to the lack of an insulating ring around the rear sensor to measure the electrical current. This feature remains limited to Garmin\u2019s Venu 2 Plus for the time being, while others like Apple and Fitbit are pushing to expand their ECG capabilities. Of course, you might never take an ECG reading with your watch, but you\u2019re bound to notice just how long some of Garmin\u2019s other features take to get up to speed. If you\u2019re new to the Garmin game, you\u2019ll have to sleep with your watch on for about three weeks before it picks up on your HRV and hones in on your sleep patterns. Luckily, it shouldn\u2019t take nearly as long if you\u2019re just coming to the Forerunner 965 from another Garmin watch, but it\u2019s something to watch for.\nGarmin Forerunner 965 specs\n| Garmin Forerunner 965 | |\n|---|---|\nDisplay | 1.4-inch AMOLED, optional always-on 454 x 454 resolution |\nDimensions and weight | 47.2 x 47.2 x 13.2mm 53g Fits wrists 135-205mm |\nColors and materials | Titanium Bezel Whitestone or Black case Amp Yellow/Black, Black/Powder Gray, or Whitestone/Powder Gray Silicone Band Gorilla Glass 3 DX display |\nBattery | Smartwatch mode: Up to 23 days GPS-only without music: Up to 31 hours SatIQ GNSS mode: Up to 22 hours All-systems GNSS mode: Up to 19 hours GPS-only GNSS with music: Up to 10.5 hours |\nSensors | GPS GLONASS GALILEO Multi-Frequency Positioning SatIQ Technology Garmin Elevate Heart Rate Sensor Barometric Altimeter Compass Gyroscope Accelerometer Thermometer Ambient Light Sensor Pulse Ox Blood Oxygen Saturation Monitor |\nDurability | 5ATM |\nConnectivity | NFC Bluetooth ANT+ Wi-Fi |\nCompatibility | Android and iOS |\nShould you buy the Garmin Forerunner 965?\nThe Garmin Forerunner 965 is an eye-catching, but maybe not groundbreaking, update to one of the best running watches you can buy. It looks and feels more like a true smartwatch than ever before thanks to the vibrant AMOLED panel, and Garmin continues to offer battery life that runs marathons, while most smartwatches would settle for a 5k. Factor in Garmin\u2019s excellent health tracking metrics and an olympiad\u2019s worth of workout types, and it\u2019s tough to find a better top-to-bottom wearable for an active lifestyle.\nThat said, I\u2019ll miss a few of the Forerunner 955\u2019s bygone features, like the solar charging ring and nearly limitless watch faces. The Forerunner 965\u2019s $100 price bump is another pretty big sticking point \u2014 especially if you already have a Forerunner 955 on your wrist. If you have an older model like the Garmin Forerunner 945, it\u2019s much easier to recommend an upgrade. After all, the Forerunner 945 was the last to miss out on advanced metrics like Training Readiness and HRV, which make it much easier to justify the $599 asking price if you\u2019re a data junkie.\nI'll miss a few legacy features, but the Garmin Forerunner 965 easily retains its place as one of the best running watches money can buy.\nAt the end of the day, however, not everyone needs a Garmin Forerunner 965. If you\u2019re planning to stick to running routes you already know and have no intention of getting lost, the Forerunner 265 ($449.99 at Garmin) is better than it\u2019s ever been. It still comes in two sizes to the Forerunner 965\u2019s single size, and it added the same AMOLED panel to the mix. Garmin also brought its advanced metrics like Training Readiness to the Forerunner 265, bringing it even closer in line with the premium running crowd.\nOf course, the Forerunner lineup as a whole is targeted at runners and other dedicated athletes. If you\u2019re more interested in a Garmin smartwatch with just the basics of fitness \u2014 and ECG support \u2014 it\u2019s hard to go wrong with the Venu 2 Plus ($449 at Amazon). The Venu 2 Plus also adds the ability to make and take calls, which is something that the Forerunner range has long stayed away from. You might also reach for the Venu 2 Plus if you\u2019re after a slightly more stylish design, thanks to a textured band and shiny bezel.\nGarmin Forerunner 965 review: FAQs\nYes, the Forerunner 965 comes with a 5ATM rating, which means it can withstand up to 50 meters of water pressure.\nYes, Garmin\u2019s 5ATM rating means that you can swim without risking water damage. The Forerunner 965 also has several workout modes to detect swimming in different bodies of water.\nYes. As long as you link your Garmin Connect account to your Strava account, the Forerunner 965 will automatically sync your workouts.\nThe Forerunner 965 has 32GB of onboard storage for music and podcasts, though you\u2019ll have to connect Bluetooth headphones in order to play your music.\nYes, you can shower with the Garmin Forerunner 965 due to its water resistance.\nYes, the Forerunner 965 tracks sleep and presents your overview as part of the morning report.\nYes, the Forerunner 965 supports GPS, GLONASS, and GALILEO.\nThank you for being part of our community.

Learn more.\nI've tested smartwatches for Android and iPhone for years: These are the only picks I'd buy in 2025\nApril 22, 2025\nSmartwatches are no longer a novelty. I see more wrists strapped into wearables than analog timepieces on a daily basis. Yet, a growing market only means more room for competition and a more confusing shopping experience. After testing countless smartwatches over the years, I\u2019ve honed in on what makes a device the most valuable, including user experience, feature set, fitness tracking tools, and sensor package, without forgetting about comfort and looks. Depending on what ecosystem you belong to, the watches below represent the top smartwatches I recommend.\nGoogle Pixel Watch 3: The best smartwatch for Android users\n- Larger, secondary case size\n- Multi-day battery life\n- Added wellness features, including advanced running metrics\n- Refined integration with Pixel phones and Google services\n- Accurate heart rate tracking\n- Runs Wear OS 5\n- GPS unimproved from Pixel Watch 2\n- Inconsistent total distances\n- Higher price than GW7 (but worth it)\nWhen Google officially entered the smartwatch race, the company had a bit of a jerky start. The first generation introduced an attractive look but fell painfully short in other areas, especially battery life. The second generation cleaned up some of the line\u2019s early issues but still didn\u2019t offer an experience quite as refined as other brands. Fortunately, the company\u2019s growing pains seem to be behind them, as the Google Pixel Watch 3 proves a fantastic device worthy of being called the best Wear OS smartwatch available.\nLaunched with Google\u2019s latest software on board, the Pixel Watch 3 offers a pure and powerful Wear OS 5 experience, including upgraded integration with Pixel phones and other Google products and services. Thanks to built-in Fitbit health and fitness tracking tools, the watch also features a robust wellness platform. I found the GPS a little shaky during some workouts, but the heart rate accuracy is genuinely staggering.\nWhat\u2019s more, Google also introduced a second case size, offering a better fit for more wrists. Both models retain the same minimalist design users fell in love with but now feature better display specs, shrunken bezels, and better battery life. For the first time, the Pixel Watch 3 is a true multi-day device.\nApple Watch Series 10: The best smartwatch for iPhone users\n- Increased display size\n- Thinner, sleeker build\n- FDA-approved sleep apnea detection\n- Useful watchOS 11 updates and additions\n- Faster charging\n- Same 18-24 hour battery life\n- No SpO2 measurements disabled in US\n- Vitals app somewhat simplified\nIt\u2019s genuinely hard to beat an Apple Watch if you\u2019re a shopper within Apple\u2019s ecosystem. The lineup features unmatched third-party app support and seamless integration with iPhones. My device is loaded with everything from Spotify to Audible, and it\u2019s where I field 90% of my notifications and review 100% of my wellness stats most days. Though somewhat stagnant, the company\u2019s well-known aesthetic is also clean and elegant, especially if you prefer a square display to fit more text. Meanwhile, watchOS improves year after year, delivering a more powerful experience to users\u2019 wrists.\nLike its predecessors, the newest Apple Watch Series 10 offers a dynamic, feature-packed smartwatch experience. Starting with its build, the series is available in two increased case sizes that are both thinner and sleeker. The lineup also features the largest usable display area yet on any Apple Watch, and the on-wrist look and feel is quite elevated. Though we didn\u2019t see any improvement to battery specs, the watches charge remarkably fast, powering up from zero to 55% in just twenty minutes during my review.\nFor fitness tracking, the Series 10 packs a bevy of sensors, including a depth gauge for snorkeling, a heart rate sensor that can keep up with a dedicated chest strap, and GPS tracking that matches routes recorded by much higher-end GPS watches. In other words, I\u2019ve found the Series 10 a highly reliable workout companion. Thanks to watchOS 11, users will find more advanced training tools and an upgraded workout app for recording even more stats. The watch also tracks everything from sleep to stress and will even detect signs of sleep apnea.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7: The best smartwatch for Samsung phone users\n- Useful new Energy Score\n- Sleek, refined design\n- Familiar Wear OS experience\n- Easily interchangeable watch bands\n- Reasonable price\n- More accurate heart rate monitor\n- Some Samsung-exclusive features\n- GPS tracking still struggles with tall buildings\n- Still mostly minor updates\n- Battery life is good but not great\nSamsung\u2019s stable remains the best place to shop if you\u2019re a Samsung phone user, and the Galaxy Watch 7 continues the company\u2019s trend of launching successful Wear OS devices year after year. The smartwatch offers a familiar software experience, with Wear OS 5 running under Samsung\u2019s One UI 6 Watch overlay, plus a whole layer of powerful Galaxy AI-powered metrics and tools, like Energy Score, Race Partner, and sleep apnea detection.\nI was especially excited to see that heart rate monitoring improved on the newest model. Of course, if you want a larger, more rugged build with better battery life and accurate GPS tracking, Samsung also launched the Galaxy Watch Ultra ($649.99 at Amazon) at a much higher price point.\nGarmin Venu 3: The best smartwatch for detailed fitness tracking\n- Highly accurate GPS and heart rate sensors\n- Automatic nap detection and sleep coaching\n- On-device phone call and voice assistant support\n- Up to 14-day battery life\n- Larger display\n- Pricey compared to competitors\n- No LTE model\n- Limited third-party app support\nThe Garmin Venu 3 is easily one of the best Garmin watches you can buy and the best pick for anyone in need of a more fitness-focused wearable. The dual-sized lineup boasts top-tier multi-GNSS, and I found that the GPS tracking on the Venu 3 is incredibly accurate, especially for a smartwatch rather than a dedicated GPS wearable. If you\u2019re a runner or cyclist, this is a huge highlight. On the heart rate monitoring front, the Venu 3 features an Elevate V5 optical heart rate sensor, which I found highly reliable, and the sensor is even certified to provide ECG readings. It also has training tools like Recovery Time, Workout Benefit, and Perceived Exertion. As for smartwatch features, the device is a bit leaner than others on this list. It offers phone call support and voice assistant compatibility when a paired phone is nearby, music storage, and an onscreen flashlight feature.\nOnePlus Watch 3: The best smartwatch for battery life\n- Fantastic battery life\n- Powerful Wear OS 5 platform\n- Functional rotating crown\n- Spacious, colorful display\n- Bulky single case size\n- Some features unavailable at launch\n- Imperfect heart rate and GPS data\n- No LTE model (yet)\nAnother solid option from the Wear OS family worth considering, the OnePlus Watch 3 features dual-chip architecture, housing the Snap W5 running Wear OS 5 plus a second \u201cefficiency chipset\u201d for running RTOS. This creates a dynamic user experience with distinctive use modes for extreme battery savings. In smartwatch mode, the watch lasts up to 5 days between charges. In Power saver mode, Wear OS disappears from the user experience, stretching battery life for days more while still offering basic smart features and wellness tracking functions. During my review, I found the software experience smooth and the device responsive in both modes. It is, however, only available in one 47mm case size, which may be too large for some wrists.\nMobvoi TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro: The best smartwatch for a unique, battery-saving display\n- Dual display is fantastic\n- Updated digital crown\n- Improved durability\n- Same snappy performance\n- Doesn\u2019t run the latest Wear OS\n- No wireless charging\n- Only available in one size\n- No LTE model\nMobvoi\u2019s TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro is one of my favorite devices for a truly unique dual-display that facilitates excellent battery life. The watch is also durably built with Sapphire glass and a functional rotating crown for smooth navigation. Its GPS performed well during my review period, and I am a big fan of the color-coded heart rate zones for fine-tuned training. However, my hesitation in recommending this watch is that it still runs an older Wear OS, while other companies stretch the gap with newer, more powerful software. I would love to see a rollout schedule to feel confident that the device will eventually see a Wear OS 5 update.\nWithings ScanWatch 2: The best hybrid smartwatch\n- Premium, classy design\n- Up to 30-day battery life\n- Broad health tracking tools\n- Useful fitness tracking\n- Available in two sizes\n- Limited display space\n- High price point\n- No built-in GPS\n- Few smart features\nThe Withings ScanWatch 2 is my specialty pick, with a classy, analog form factor and undercover advanced health tracking. The device offers a medical-grade ECG monitor, pulse oximeter, and 24/7 heart rate monitoring. It will notify you of warning signs of bradycardia and tachycardia and provide ECG readings on demand. It also boasts sensors for measuring skin and ambient temperatures, plus overnight blood oxygen monitoring and respiratory scans for detecting warning signs of sleep apnea. It\u2019s proved a highly reliable sleep tracker through my review period and offers the longest-lasting battery life of any device in this list. Personally, I also love the addition of detailed female health tracking on-device, plus automatic workout detection for more than 40 activities.\nGarmin Fenix 8 AMOLED: The best ultra-premium smartwatch\n- Bright built-in flashlight\n- Excellent battery life\n- Accurate activity tracking\n- Three case sizes\n- Punchy speaker\n- Sharp AMOLED face\n- Proprietary charging cable\n- Titanium costs extra\n- Bulky on smaller wrists\n- Very expensive\nThe Venu 3 is great, but the Fenix 8 AMOLED is the absolute best Garmin watch and the best ultra-premium smartwatch that money can buy. Its three case sizes (41mm, 47mm, and 51mm) make it so that there\u2019s a Fenix for almost every wrist, and the new microphone and speaker mean you don\u2019t need another smartwatch for your everyday life. In fact, Garmin\u2019s new support for voice assistants means that the Fenix 8 AMOLED is better able to compete with Ultra-branded wearables from Apple and Samsung, yet offers significantly better battery life than either one with up to 16 days from the 47mm model. The Fenix 8 AMOLED isn\u2019t just a pretty face, either, combining the reliable Elevate V5 heart rate sensor with an impressive set of workout tools like Training Readiness, Body Battery, and more activity types than I\u2019ve managed to use in my month with the watch. Although the Garmin Fenix 8 AMOLED might be a bit too rugged for some casual wearers (and cost a bit more than most will want to pay), you\u2019ll be hard pressed to find a watch with more adventure behind its crisp, vibrant display.\nWhat to look for in a good smartwatch\nKnowing where to start is not easy if you\u2019re shopping for your first smartwatch. Software experience and compatibility are crucial, but don\u2019t always narrow the field enough. You\u2019ll also want to determine what your priorities are in terms of features and specs. Do you want an extension of your phone, or are you interested in tracking intense workouts or advanced health stats? Does daily charging sound cumbersome? The topics below are all points I think are worth considering before you commit to any of the smartwatches I\u2019ve recommended in this guide, or generally on the wider market:\n- Is it compatible with your phone (Android or iOS)?\n- Does it run the latest software version?\n- Is the brand renowned for good update consistency?\n- What is your budget?\n- Does the smartwatch have first- and third-party app support?\n- How good is the battery life?\n- Does it cater to your fitness tracking needs?\n- Does it have onboard or connected GPS (preferably the former)?\n- How accurate is the heart rate tracking?\n- Does it have SpO2 monitoring?\n- Does it have accurate sleep tracking?\n- Can it take on-wrist phone calls?\n- Is there a voice assistant for hands-free use?\n- How does it handle notifications?\n- Does it have digital payment support?\n- How useful is the companion app (and does it have one at all)?\n- Is the fit comfortable?\n- Does the look match your aesthetic?\nWhy you should trust me\nI\u2019ve been professionally testing and reviewing wearables for years, dating back to before Samsung teamed up with Google for the Wear OS we now know and love, and long before Apple launched its first-generation, massive Ultra. I\u2019ve reviewed dozens of smartwatches, fitness trackers, dedicated heart rate monitors, smart rings, sleep trackers, exercise equipment, and health and fitness apps and platforms. In other words, I\u2019ve sweated my way through a ton of products to learn what makes them valuable and what features matter most.\nI've been professionally testing and reviewing wearables for more than four years.\nAt the start of every review, my focus is twofold: user experience and value. First, I approach each product as a typical user, noting everything from comfort and design to performance and features. I fire off texts, download apps, and tap into everything from timers to gesture controls. To dig even deeper, I bring expertise and comparable metrics to the conversation, using tools like heart rate monitors, pedometers, pulse oximeters, and trusted sleep trackers and GPS devices. I create varied workout plans to test fitness tracking accuracy and closely monitor my stress and sleep to review recovery metrics. Above all, I wear the device consistently to garner a thorough understanding of what it offers and what it\u2019s like to own. I also simultaneously use competitors\u2019 products to compare differences and collect comparative data.\nWhat is your favorite smartwatch brand right now\nWhen all that is done, I sit down with the wearable and all the details I\u2019ve collected to evaluate its value. This means establishing its place in the larger market and determining whether its price is fair for what it offers. If a product boasts a large feature set but doesn\u2019t deliver accuracy, it may not be worth its price. Conversely, if a wearable successfully executes more tools than competitors of equal price, I rate it higher.\nTypically, my review period lasts at least a week, giving me time to explore the product fully. For some launches, this process can extend to weeks or months. I also revisit the devices I test regularly to check in on software updates and feature drops and to make sure my original findings stand the test of time.\nThank you for being part of our community.
