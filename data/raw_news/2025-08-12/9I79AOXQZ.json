  "content": "A POLICE force sent undercover cops jogging to expose vile catcallers who target women on their runs.\n\nTwo officers from Surrey Police hit the streets in sportswear to show how often women get harassed while running - and, unsurprisingly, they were \"catcalled within minutes\".\n\nThe operation, first reported by LBC, saw undercover officers jogging through known harassment \u201chotspots\u201d in Reigate, Surrey during the evening rush hour.\n\nSpecialist units were close by to intervene if the women faced abuse, Surrey Police said.\n\nThe two officers were \"targeted within minutes\" by a man in a large truck who \"honked at them and made gestures out the window\", according to LBC.\n\n\"These behaviours may not be criminal offences in themselves, but they need to be addressed,\" a spokesperson for the force said.\n\nInspector John Vale said: \"One of our officers was honked at within ten minutes - then another vehicle slowed down, beeping and making gestures just 30 seconds later - that's how frequent it is.\n\n\"Someone slowing down, staring, shouting - even if it's not always criminal - it can have a huge impact on people's everyday lives and stops women from doing something as simple as going for a run.\n\n\"We have to ask: is that person going to escalate? Are they a sexual offender? We want to manage that risk early.\"\n\nPC Abby Hayward, who went undercover, said this form of sexual harassment was a daily reality for women - and one that makes her \"diminished\" and \"uneasy\".\n\nShe said: \u201cThis behaviour is either a precursor to something more serious or it\u2019s ignorance, and it\u2019s fixable.\n\n\"That\u2019s where our interventions come in: to stop potential repeat offenders or help people understand that what they\u2019re doing isn\u2019t OK.\u201d\n\nSurrey Police said its \u2018Jog On\u2019 campaign - launched just four weeks ago - has led to 18 arrests, including for sexual assault and theft.\n\nInspector Vale said: \"We know that this kind of harassment is significantly under reported thanks to a study carried out by Surrey County Council this year, which revealed that of 450 female residents surveyed, 49 per cent never reported.\n\n\"To date, we have made a number of interventions following reports of harassment of our plain clothes runners.\n\n\"In these cases, it was deemed appropriate to provide education around anti-social behaviour.\n\n\"For repeat offenders or where the behaviour is more serious, we will robustly pursue all criminal justice outcomes.\n\n\"We recognise this is a significant worry for women and girls, and we'll continue to patrol running routes throughout Redhill.\"\n\nHe continued: \"This type of harassment isn't just being experienced by communities in Reigate and Banstead, but communities across the whole of Surrey, and it's unacceptable.\n\n\"We have female officers and staff members who have been the subject to such behaviour when off duty.\n\n\"The message I would like to impart to perpetrators is this; your actions will not be tolerated.\n\n\"Please reflect and ask yourself 'is this how you would treat or want your partner, mother, sister to be treated?\"\n\n\"The next time you see a female jogger, just think, they could be a police officer with colleagues nearby ready to stop you. Your behaviour is not welcome in Surrey.\"\n\nBut the campaign has been met with criticism by the Free Speech Union, who called it a \u201cbizarre social psychology experiment\u201d and said police should \u201cstop hunting pre-crimes\u201d.\n\nOther forces have also taken steps to tackle the sexual harassment of women runners by men.\n\nIn 2022, the Met Police launched a buddy system, with officers accompanying a women\u2019s running club in London.\n\n84 per cent of women have been harassed while jogging, according to a 2021 survey by Runner\u2019s World.",
