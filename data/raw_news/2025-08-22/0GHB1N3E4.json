  "content": "This story was originally posted to MyNorthwest.com\n\nThe husband of a candidate for Congress in Washington, who is also a veteran, was taken into U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody on Thursday.\n\nMelissa Chaudhry is running for Congress in Washington\u2019s 9th District and is married to Pakistani native Muhammad Zahid Chaudhry. The couple thought Muhammad Zahid Chaudhry was taking a step toward citizenship when he arrived for an interview at an immigration office in Tukwila. Instead, he was detained by ICE.\n\n\u201cWe saw faithlessness and we saw betrayal, when we came in good faith, with open hands and put ourselves into their power,\u201d Melissa Chaudhry told KIRO Newsradio. \u201cAnd now my family is torn in pieces, and my soul is shredded, and I have to explain this to our two little children who don\u2019t know what happened to their Baba.\u201d\n\nMelissa Chaudhry said her husband is a disabled U.S. military veteran who has lived in the country for 25 years.\n\n\u201cThey waited an hour before they told us, according to what I spoke with him when he was in the detention center, and they have given us no explanation as to why,\u201d Melissa Chaudhry said.\n\nMuhammad Zahid Chaudhry was allegedly involved in two incidents where he made misrepresentations to government officials after he came to America in 2000, The Olympian reported.\n\nMuhammad Zahid Chaudhry was a taxi driver in Australia in 1996 when one of his customers didn\u2019t have money for their fare and left their passport as a promise to return with cash. Muhammad Zahid Chaudhry allegedly used the passport to try to open a bank account and obtain medical benefits, according to court records obtained by The Olympian.\n\nMuhammad Zahid Chaudhry also used a credit card that wasn\u2019t his, Australian police reported.\n\nMuhammad Zahid Chaudhry was subsequently criminally convicted, but did not mention it in his 2001 visa application, according to The Olympian. Melissa Chaudhry said the conviction was the equivalent of a parking ticket.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s far beyond the look back period for good moral character, and when it comes to naturalization, especially for veterans,\u201d she said.\n\nShe had no comment on the claim that he lied on a U.S. visa application in 2001.\n\nMuhammad Zahid Chaudhry also allegedly misrepresented his citizenship in an application to become a reserve officer at the Yakima Police Department. He did serve in the National Guard.\n\n\u201cThis should have resulted in him being finally granted the naturalization he earned as a disabled, decorated, honorably discharged American veteran from 20 years ago, but ICE had other plans,\u201d Melissa Chaudhry said.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t know what will happen next.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know right now when, if ever, I will see my husband again, or on what continents or in what decade, everything is a possibility right now,\u201d Melissa Chaudhry shared.\n\nShe said she plans to file what she can so that ICE will tell her why her husband was detained and secure his release.\n\nThe couple has a two-year-old daughter and an 8-month-old son.",
