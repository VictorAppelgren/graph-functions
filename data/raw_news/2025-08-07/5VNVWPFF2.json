  "description": "The teenager\u2019s \u00a329million move to Stamford Bridge was first agreed in May 2024 but he remained in Brazil for a year",
  "content": "Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca has called for restraint from supporters regarding the highly anticipated arrival of Brazilian prodigy Estevao Willian.\n\nThe 18-year-old's \u00a329 million transfer from Palmeiras was initially agreed in May 2024, but he remained in Brazil for a year, even finding the net against his new club during a Club World Cup encounter in the United States in July.\n\nHaving netted 27 goals and provided 15 assists across 83 appearances for Palmeiras, Estevao finally completed his move to west London this week.\n\nWidely regarded as one of Brazil's most promising young talents, Maresca is keen to ensure that expectations surrounding Estevao are tempered ahead of the upcoming season.\n\n\u201cWe need to pay a little bit more attention, because first of all he\u2019s from the other part of the world and also he\u2019s very, very young,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we need to pay attention.\n\n\u201cAs I said, (he is) not under pressure, give him happiness, give him time, he needs to adapt. Hopefully we can give him minutes, so he\u2019s even more happy. But for sure, he\u2019s a talented player.\n\n\u201cFor me, the biggest mistake we can do with him is to put him under pressure. He\u2019s very young, he needs to adapt.\n\n\u201cI met him for the first time in the USA when we played against Palmeiras. He\u2019s a fantastic player, he\u2019s very young, he\u2019s a happy boy. He\u2019s always laughing, typical from a Brazilian guy, and we need to keep him happy.\u201d\n\nEstevao is one of six summer signings expected to be part of Maresca\u2019s squad this season.\n\nAnd with 10 departures it has been another summer of change at the club\u2019s Cobham training base.\n\nMaresca has previously said he expects players to be able to play in a number of roles and wants at least two players for each position.\n\nNominally a winger, Estevao is likely to be deployed across Chelsea\u2019s attacking line.\n\n\u201cHe can play everywhere,\u201d said Maresca. \u201cHe\u2019s so good. For me, he\u2019s like Cole (Palmer), in terms of \u2013 careful \u2013 he is like Cole in terms of his position.\n\n\u201cHe can play outside, he can play inside, he can play everywhere. In our five attacking positions, for me, he can play everywhere.\u201d\n\nMaresca confirmed that defender Levi Colwill is a doubt for the start of the new Premier League season.\n\nThe Blues kick off at home to Crystal Palace on August 17 but after picking up a knock in training the 22-year-old could miss out, possibly opening the door to new defensive signing from Ajax, Jorrel Hato.\n\n\u201cWe had a problem the last two days with Levi Colwill, that we don\u2019t know how long he is going to be out,\u201d said Maresca.\n\n\u201cSo for us, we will see, hopefully not too long, but for sure it\u2019s a problem for us. We need to wait, we don\u2019t know yet.\u201d",

Everyone knew he could play.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to say anything. He knows what he needs to do tomorrow. He has to do his job. I hope he gives his best for the owners of Chelsea and they look at him and his potential and all the quality he has.\n\u201cIt will be an opportunity for him to show how good he is. We will expect his best, the maximum in attack and defence and maybe he will score a goal to give a goodbye for our fans.\n\u201cWe helped him to grow as a man and a professional. It could be a moment to give him a goodbye with one amazing game, maybe with one goal.\u201d\nFerreira has urged Philadelphia\u2019s sports fans to get behind Palmeiras for the July 4 encounter.\nHe said: \u201cIt will be a good opportunity for the locals to join with us against the English. Tomorrow it is Independence Day against the English. Join us, we need your support!\u201d\nTournament organiser FIFA has confirmed the match will be preceded by a minute\u2019s silence for Diogo Jota, the Liverpool forward who has died along with his brother Andre Silva, also a professional footballer, following a car accident in Spain.\nFerreira, 46, who used to play for Silva\u2019s club Penafiel, said: \u201cThis is very sad news. I would like to give my condolences to the family and friends of these two amazing athletes.\n\u201cI always tell my players we should live in the moment. We need to be thankful and enjoy life, as we never know what is going to happen tomorrow.\u201d"
