  "description": "Zar Saccutelli fears it is only a matter of time until Dezi Freeman comes looking for him, as the five-day manhunt for the alleged double cop killer continues.",
  "content": "A man who first felt the wrath of alleged cop killer Dezi Freeman in 2018 fears it is only a matter of time until the dangerous fugitive comes looking for him.\n\nZar Saccutelli, whose neighbour war with Freeman aired on A Current Affair - in which the Saccutellis were portrayed as the antagonists - is having trouble sleeping as the suspected gunman remains at large in Victoria's high country bush for a fifth day.\n\n'This is the sort of guy who is so bitter and twisted that he might decide, 'If I'm going to die, I may as well take out the people I don't like with me',' he told Daily Mail.\n\n'I keep waking up expecting to find him at the foot of my bed.'\n\nFreeman, 56, is accused of murdering Detective Leading Senior Constable Neal Thompson, 59, and Senior Constable Vadim De Waart, 35, on Tuesday, when they entered his Rayner Track address outside Porepunkah to execute a warrant for alleged historical sex abuse against a child.\n\nTensions are running high in the usually tranquil town, with locals divided over whether or not Freeman is still in the area. On Saturday afternoon, police once again attended Rayner Track and momentarily converged around the fugitive's home.\n\nIt came as police appeared to find a new area of focus on the other side of Mount Buffalo from the original crime scene - where Mr Saccutelli and his neighbours have homes.\n\nMr Saccutelli, 59, fled his Buffalo Creek Road property on Wednesday on friends' advice, amid fears Freeman may seek revenge over their neighbourhood disputes.\n\nFreeman used to live on that side of the mountain, where he allegedly terrorised the Saccutellis, threatening to kill Zar's 15-year-old son, and stalked and spied on fellow local Loretta Quinn.\n\nFreeman and his wife Mali gave an interview to A Current Affair in 2018, where they portrayed the Saccutellis as 'bogans from Buffalo' who would rev dirt bikes and chainsaws, shattering the supposed peace of their rented home.\n\nThe war became so unbearable that the Saccutellis considered selling the lifestyle block that had been in their family for 30 years.\n\nMr Saccutelli was relieved when the Freemans moved out, but has sought an apology from Channel Nine's A Current Affair for portraying himself and his family as the villains in the now infamous 2018 segment.\n\nNow, the terrified father has made an emotional plea for police to find Freeman so he can stop living in fear.\n\nMr Saccutelli, who has a home in a nearby town where he has remained since leaving Buffalo Creek on Wednesday, implored police to check his property, where he had an unlocked caravan.\n\nHe feared Freeman knew of the caravan and may be using it to hide.\n\nMr Saccutelli is unsure whether police attended the property, so this reporter agreed to check on the buildings for him on Saturday and entered with permission - the caravan and main dwelling appeared untouched.\n\nFellow Buffalo Creek neighbour Serge Parisotto, who used to be Freeman's landlord and sometime drinking buddy when he rented his home on Buffalo Creek Road until 2023, said Mr Saccutelli's fears were founded.\n\n'I told Zar when he was here on Wednesday that he should get out of here,' he revealed.\n\nMr Parisotto also has had run-ins with Freeman and is currently living in a state of high alert.\n\nWhen Freeman left his property, he siliconed the windows shut.\n\nHe said police had searched the area with sniffer dogs on Wednesday but haven't been back since then.\n\nOn Saturday, a police convoy which included Special Operations Group officers in a Bearcat, along with detectives, uniformed police and dogs raced to Clemens Lane - just minutes from Mr Saccutelli, Mr Parisotto and Ms Quinn's homes.\n\nThis marked a dramatic change in direction for the 450-strong personnel operation.\n\nClemens Lane is more than a 30-minute drive from the Rayner Track site where Freeman fled, heavily armed, into the bush - and is minutes from Buffalo Creek Drive.\n\nAccording to neighbours, Ms Quinn's dogs were set off on Saturday morning - but it's understood she was not home.\n\nMs Quinn, who lives alone and once successfully secured a restraining order against Freeman, told Daily Mail she has been 'peering into the bush' and was 'freaked out'.\n\nFreeman entered her property and had a furious confrontation with her son in 2018. Even after the restraining order, Ms Quinn would find rock cairns built on her land, and suspected it was Freeman leaving chilling reminders that he was still around.\n\nMr Parisotto said it was 'very feasible' that skilled bushman Freeman could have made his way over the mountain range to their cluster of residences.\n\nMr Parisotto, who was once on good terms with Freeman and would 'have a few beers with him' explained that there were multiple tracks he could have taken.\n\n'He was always out in that bush - he would disappear in there for days on end,' he said.\n\nSome locals have speculated Freeman may have fled the area, but Mr Parisotto doesn't agree - he shook his head at this suggestion and looked meaningfully at this reporter.\n\nHe nodded when asked if Freeman was in the bush nearby.\n\nBoth Mr Parisotto and Ms Quinn declined to be photographed.\n\nResidents on nearby Clemens Lane were left frightened and frustrated this morning when police barricaded the entrance to their rural road.\n\nOne man trying to access the street told police his wife and dog were alone in their home, while another couple was trying to get back to their teenage children.\n\nPolice reassured concerned locals that the barricade was only there to prevent media access.\n\nOne officer revealed to a local that the convoy had stormed the area to question someone.\n\nOn Friday, a locked-down Porepunkah slowly reopened to locals, while tourists wanting to access Victoria's nearby snowfields were still advised to seek alternate routes.\n\nPunkah Pub resumed business on Friday night and did a roaring trade for both residents and the nation's media.\n\nVenue manager Misty-Rose Wilson told Daily Mail she knew Freeman in passing, and detailed his exceptional bush skills.\n\nShe said he was capable of precision shooting from 200metre distances, and was adept at making snares.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, 10 officers arrived at the Freemans' remote farmhouse in Porepunkah with a warrant over historic sexual assault charges\n\nInstead of surrendering, Freeman allegedly grabbed a homemade shotgun and opened fire. Detective Leading Thompson, 59, was killed in the ambush. Senior Constable De Waart, 35, was also gunned down.\n\nA third officer was wounded but survived.\n\nThe manhunt continues to be hampered by bad weather conditions, with a blizzard descending on Mt Buffalo on Friday night.\n\nDezi's wife, Mali Freeman, 42, and their 15-year-old son were arrested during a dramatic police raid at a property in Porepunkah on Thursday night. They were interviewed and released without charge, pending further inquiries.\n\nHours after her arrest, Ms Freeman was spotted visiting Wangaratta Magistrates' Court for unknown reasons. She was flanked by several supporters, who tried to shield Ms Freeman from the television cameras.\n\nVictoria Police Chief Commissioner Mike Bush has urged Freeman 'to lay down your firearms and give yourself up'.\n\n'I can assure you that we have every resource we require to locate the person responsible for this horrific homicide,' he told a press conference.",

      "text": "- Woman living alone sought restraining order on Dezi Freeman\n- He allegedly stalked and spied on her, and left creepy mementos for her to find\n- READ MORE: Suspected cop killer's wife's disturbing warning\nA single mum who lived next door to suspected cop killer Dezi Freeman endured years of terror before she took out a restraining order to protect herself against him.\nFreeman is alleged to have gunned down two Victorian police officers in cold blood at his rural property near Porepunkah in the Victorian High Country on Tuesday.\nBut in a five-year reign of terror, the 'sovereign citizen' allegedly stalked and spied on Loretta Quinn, 57, whose land bordered a property Freeman was renting.\nHe would frequently confront her in her own paddock, filming her every movement as he tried to provoke an angry row, and flew drones over her land to intimidate her.\n'I would lie awake at night - I was alone, living in a container home - wondering if he was outside,' she said.\n'I just had this sick feeling about him, and I was here on my own - he was threatening me all the time.'\nShe added; 'I told the police at one stage that Dezi is a ticking time bomb that will go off.\n'They knew that. They had to play good cop, bad cop with him because they couldn't treat him like a normal person.'\nA single mum who lived next door to suspected cop killer Dezi Freeman (pictured) endured years of terror before she took out a restraining order to protect herself against him\nMs Quinn took photos of Freeman allegedly on her land\nStock image of a woman peering into the bush. Ms Quinn declined to be pictured\nMs Quinn still lives in the area and is fear of the alleged killer still on the loose in the Victorian High Country bush as the huge police manhunt enters its third day.\nOn Thursday she told the Daily Mail she's now suffering disturbing flashbacks of her long-running war with Freeman, which ended in chilling threats and legal action.\n'I'm standing at the window now, looking out into the bush,' she told Daily Mail on Thursday. 'It's freaky. I'm glad my dogs are here.'\nShe said Freeman would've been prepared for a life on the run in the bush long before the shootout on his property, and would have stockpiles of food hidden away.\n'He knows that mountain like the back of his hand - so he'll be in a mine or a cave and he'll have a swag. He'll be nice and warm,' she said.\nA shocking video of one of Freeman's outbursts has resurfaced after it was posted on social media by her daughter Claire in the wake of the killings.\nIn the video, Freeman could be seen filming Ms Quinn's son, who told him he had called the police to get Freeman off their land.\nBut Freeman - who has called the police Gestapo Nazi terrorist thugs - fired back as he filmed the encounter on his phone and wearing a bodycam on a harness.\nIn a five-year reign of terror, Dezi Freeman (poictured with his wife Mali) allegedly stalked and spied on Loretta Quinn, 57, whose land bordered a property Freeman was renting\nOn one occasion, Freeman was seen walking across the property with children\nDezi Freeman is allegedly heavily armed and on the run\n'What's going to happen, is you're going to be charged for making a false report to police, and sued, and I'll be going for damages,' he told the youngster.\nMs Quinn said her son walked away from the flashpoint with Freeman, and she said she was 'so proud' of him for not rising to the bait.\nShe highlighted the blatant hypocrisy of Freeman being anti-government and anti-police, but relying on authorities to make her life hell.\nShe said he would fly drones over her land and report her to Alpine Council for trivial issues such as her clearing invasive shrubs like blackberry bushes off her own land.\n'He was constantly walking through saying all this legal jargon and trying to intimidate me,' she said. 'He was threatening me all the time.\n'Sometimes I'd be out on the excavator and I'd turn around and he'd just be there, filming me. It was constant.'\nFreeman even transformed a chook shed by his gate into a hideout where he would sit for hours spying on his neighbours.\n'He covered it in black plastic and had a peephole,' Ms Quinn said. 'You knew he was in there filming.'\nFreeman is known to have good 'bushcraft' and likes to wear camouflage\nPolice in Porepunkah continue the hunt for the suspected gunman\nShe would lie awake at night wondering if her neighbour was outside watching her\nShe added: 'He was already renting his place when we bought our land in 2017, and he was so dirty about it.\n'He referred to us as cashed-up bogans from the city - never mind that we were horsey people from Gippsland.\n'He was using our land to get to the National Park. And I told him we were fine with him using it as long as he gave me a call first.\n'But he had the attitude of, \"No, I don't have to ask you nothing - I can do what I want\",' she said. 'He was continuously out there.'\nThe access row sparked five years of hell for Ms Quinn, who would routinely spot Freeman lurking on her land.\nShe shared chilling pictures of him - at times with children, and other times alone - dressed in camouflage fatigues lurking on her property.\n'Sometimes I'd be out on the excavator and I'd turn around and he'd just be there, filming me,' Ms Quinn added. 'It was constant.'\nThe land dispute ended in Wangaratta Magistrates Court in 2020 when it ruled in Ms Quinn's favour, declaring her track was private.\nMs Quinn suspects rock cairns left on her property were Freeman showing he'd been there\nLoretta Quinn's son filmed a 2018 confrontation with Dezi Freeman on his mother's land\nThe home of Dezi Freeman, where he allegedly gunned down multiple police officers\nMs Quinn also successfully obtained a three-year restraining order on Freeman.\nFreeman responded by trying to arrest the magistrate.\nBut Ms Quinn suspects even the restraining order didn't stop him, and found man-made rock piles scattered throughout her bushland, as if a warning he was still there.\nFellow neighbour Zar Saccutelli - who was embroiled in his own disputes with Freeman which ended up on A Current Affair in 2018 - confirmed the existence of the chook shed hideout.\nIn 2023, Ms Quinn succeeded in convincing Freeman's landlord to kick him out - and he finally left, but not before a last show of defiance.\n'He siliconed the windows of the house shut,' Ms Quinn said.\nAs more comes to light about Freeman's beliefs, Ms Quinn - who works for a Myrtleford business - hopes she'll be vindicated in the eyes of some locals.\n'I copped a lot of s*** from the locals [when I stood up for myself], saying I better watch what I say because [Freeman] was lovely,' she said.\n'I want to ring those people now.'"
