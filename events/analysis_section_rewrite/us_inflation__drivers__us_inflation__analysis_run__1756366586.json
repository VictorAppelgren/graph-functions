      "feedback": "Your draft is too skeletal and misses the core of the “cross‑topic” synthesis the brief demands. Rewrite it as a single, tightly‑structured paragraph that first spells out the three macro regimes (A‑disinflation, B‑sticky inflation, C‑growth slowdown) and the key policy levers (Fed rate path, wage‑growth momentum, Jackson‑Hole signals, semiconductor capex). Then, for each regime, map the expected impact on the S&P 500’s ROIC‑vs‑WACC dynamics, overseas AUM conversion to fee income (cite MUFG AM ≈ $164 B, Mizuho AM ≈ $489 B), and cross‑border flows (real policy‑rate differentials, BoP/terms of trade, productivity). Follow with a concise valuation/technical snapshot: e.g., “in Regime A, the 10‑Y Treasury yield is projected to fall to 1.5‑2.0 % (source J99EM2TPZ), lowering discount rates by ~0.5 % and boosting S&P 500 valuations by ~8 % (source T1QE6JPIX).” Next, list decisive catalysts: (1) Fed policy easing at Jackson‑Hole, (2) semiconductor capex acceleration, (3) oil supply‑demand balance (Regime A: supply +2.5 mbpd, demand 0.68‑0.70 mbpd → Brent mid‑$60s, source J99EM2TPZ), (4) Euro‑area inflation trajectory (Regime A 12‑24 mo productivity boost → lower discount rates, source R3WNA7L7A). Highlight fragilities: e.g., a sudden shift to Regime B if inflation persists beyond 3 % (source NL5YYTLF2). Finally, embed a watch‑list of signals: Fed minutes, semiconductor capex reports, OPEC+ supply updates, Euro‑area CPI releases. Ensure every claim is backed by a source ID, avoid generic statements, and quantify ranges (e.g., “yield drop 1.5‑2.0 %”, “oil supply +2.5 mbpd”). This will elevate depth, coherence, and actionable insight.",
