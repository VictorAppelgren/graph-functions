  "title": "A Detroit street is named in honor of Vincent Chin \u2013 his death mobilized Asian American activists nationwide",
  "description": "In 1982, the brutal beating and death of Vincent Chin near a Detroit nightclub enraged the Asian American community and led to changes in the legal system.",
  "content": "The legacy of Vincent Chin has recently been commemorated in a street sign bearing his name on the corner of Cass Avenue and Peterboro Street in Detroit\u2019s historic Chinatown.\n\nI was glad to see it. Watching the 1987 documentary \u201cWho Killed Vincent Chin?\u201d and learning about his life and Asian American activism changed my life.\n\nI was 18 and taking my first Asian American studies class at the University of California, Santa Barbara. The film made me realize two things: Asian Americans are targets of racial violence, and Asian Americans across the ethnic spectrum could join together to fight for civil rights. This led to my passion for social justice.\n\nI\u2019m proud to now be a professor of Asian American studies and critical race theory who teaches my students about Vincent Chin.\n\nSo who was Chin, and why did his death catalyze an Asian American civil rights movement?\n\nChin, an Oak Park resident, was 27 years old on the night of his bachelor party, June 19, 1982. He got into a fight with two white men \u2013 Ronald Ebens, a Chrysler car plant supervisor, and Michael Nitz, an unemployed autoworker and Ebens\u2019 stepson.\n\nAccording to Racine Colwell, a dancer at the Fancy Pants Club in the Detroit area, Ebens shouted, \u201cIt\u2019s because of you little motherf\u2013kers that we\u2019re out of work.\u201d Detroit in the early 1980s was in an automotive slump. People blamed Japanese auto imports and the Japanese people, in general, for the economic downturn. The assailants didn\u2019t seem to understand or care that Chin was actually Chinese.\n\nAfter the fight between Chin and Nitz and Ebens, Chin and his friends ran out of the club. Ebens and Nitz ran after them, with Nitz grabbing a baseball bat from his car. When they found Chin outside a McDonald\u2019s on Woodward Avenue, Nitz held Chin while Ebens beat his body and head with the bat. They were stopped by two off-duty police officers who had been inside the fast-food restaurant.\n\nAfter the attack, Jimmy Choi, a member of the bachelor party, cradled Chin in his arms. He said that Chin\u2019s last words were \u201cIt\u2019s not fair.\u201d Chin died four days later.\n\nEbens and Nitz were charged with second-degree murder, but their lawyers pleaded the charge down to manslaughter. At the end of the trial, Judge Charles Kaufman fined them US$3,000 each and sentenced each to three years\u2019 probation, explaining: \u201cThese weren\u2019t the kind of people you send to prison. \u2026 You don\u2019t make the punishment fit the crime. You make the punishment fit the criminal.\u201d\n\nThe sentencing enraged Chin\u2019s friends, family and the greater Chinese and Asian American community of Detroit.\n\nActivists of various Asian ethnicities and their non-Asian allies created American Citizens for Justice, an organization that pressured the Justice Department to investigate the violation of Chin\u2019s civil rights and to see Ebens and Nitz imprisoned for Chin\u2019s murder. Lily Chin, Vincent\u2019s mother, was a key advocate in the pursuit of justice for her son, showing up to rallies and interviews to remind people of Vincent\u2019s death for nearly a decade.\n\nWhile there were other moments, such as the anti-eviction fight for the I-Hotel in San Francisco, that brought Asian Americans of all ethnicities together to fight for civil rights, Chin\u2019s murder sparked a broad awareness. Asian Americans realized that what happened to Chin could happen to them.\n\nAmerican Citizens for Justice held press conferences and gained support from local African American activists in Michigan and national Black leaders like Jesse Jackson, whose presence helped bring more attention to the Chin tragedy.\n\nActivists were successful in forcing the FBI to open an investigation. The resulting 1984 federal trial was the first time the Justice Department had argued that the civil rights of an Asian American person had been violated. Nitz was found not guilty on two counts. Ebens was found guilty and sentenced to 25 years in prison. However, a 1986 federal appeals court ruling overturned the conviction, freeing Ebens.\n\nA civil suit filed against Ebens and Nitz on behalf of Lily Chin was settled out of court in 1987. Nitz agreed to pay $50,000 and Ebens $1.5 million \u2013 the projected income that Chin would have made had he lived.\n\nNitz fulfilled his debt, but Ebens made only a few payments. By 1987, Ebens had been unemployed for five years. He stopped making payments after he moved to Nevada. Estimates in 2016 place Ebens\u2019 debt to the Chin estate at over $8 million, including accumulated interest.\n\nChin\u2019s death had a profound impact on the criminal justice system in Michigan and nationally. Michigan made it harder to plead down murder charges to manslaughter and required prosecutors to be present at sentencings to face victims. Nationally, victim impact statements are now commonplace. Victims and their families now have more of a voice in the justice system.\n\nChin\u2019s death spurred Pan-Asian American activism across the U.S., leading to the eventual founding of organizations like Asian Americans Advancing Justice in 1991 and Stop Asian American Pacific Islander Hate in 2020. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Stop AAPI Hate recorded violence against Asians happening in the U.S. and educated people about anti-Asian racism.\n\nToday, Asian Americans fight for social justice through organizations like these and 18 Million Rising, a group that advocates for racial justice for Asian Americans and all marginalized people.\n\nThis is the lasting legacy of Vincent Chin.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation, a nonprofit, independent news organization bringing you facts and trustworthy analysis to help you make sense of our complex world.

      "text": "The below article appeared in the Detroit Free Press Sunday Magazine on August 30, 1987. The full text is below, and scans of the original piece can be found following it.\nTHE MAN WHO KILLED VINCENT CHIN\nBy Michael Moore\nThe Detroit Free Press, August 30, 1987\nEast Detroit\u2019s Ronald Ebens was an ordinary guy. A hard worker, a good provider. Then, on a June night in 1982, he was angered by an Asian-American man in a bar. Ebens chased him and beat him to death with a baseball bat. Now, acquitted of criminal charges and having settled a civil suit, Ronald Ebens says Vincent Chin, \u201cwas looking for trouble and got it.\u201d\nRonald Ebens killed Vincent Chin, a Chinese-American, five years ago with a baseball bat, and he never served a day in jail. Now he claims he can\u2019t understand why the whole Asian-American community is angry. \u201cI don\u2019t even know them,\u201d he says. \u201c\u2026 I\u2019ve never been around them. The only ones I had ever met are the ones in the Chinese restaurants, and they were always nice and I was always nice to them.\u201d\nTHE WAGES OF DEATH\nBy Michael Moore\nThe man who killed Vincent Chin is in fine fettle on the morning of July 31. With reason. The system has worked to his advantage once more, and he is elated. Having won acquittal on federal civil rights charges months earlier, the civil suit filed by the slain man\u2019s family has been his only remaining hassle. Now a settlement has been reached. \u201cThat\u2019s it, it\u2019s over!\u201d he exclaims. \u201cDone. Finished. Over! Yeah!\u201d He can barely contain his excitement, sounding like a fan whose baseball team has just won the pennant. Then he turns sarcastic and adds: \u201cAbout all that\u2019s left to charge me with now is rape.\u201d\nRonald Ebens, 47, a former Chrysler Corp. employee, used a baseball bat to club Vincent Chin, a young Asian-American man, to death in front of a Highland Park McDonald\u2019s five years ago. Chin, 27, celebrating with his pals that night, was to have married Vicki Wong the next day.\nNow, five years and a few weeks later, it is Ebens who celebrates, even though he has just agreed to a $1.5 million settlement under which he would pay $200 a month for two years, beginning Sept. 1. Then he would start paying $200 a month or 25 percent of his net income, whichever is more.\nAny new income or sudden financial gains \u2014such as an inheritance\u2014 would be subject to the judgement: the sale of his home would not.\nAnd while that sounds like a significant penalty, Ebens is overjoyed. The terms of the settlement, he points out, require him to pay only if he has a job.\nRon Ebens hasn\u2019t had one in five years; he doesn\u2019t expect to have one in the near future. The Chin family, he says, \u201ccan\u2019t get blood from a stone.\u201d\n\u201cIt is my fervent wish,\u201d Ebens deadpans, \u201cthat I live long enough to pay off the entire amount.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be when I\u2019m 672 years old.\u201d\nIt is a month earlier, before the settlement has been reached. Ronald Ebens is sitting in his modest brick ranch home in East Detroit. The drapes are drawn, and he is watching a Saturday afternoon Western on television. He is a powerfully built man, with steel-blue eyes that are alternately trusting and suspicious.\nFor five years, since fatally clubbing Chin in front of the Highland Park McDonald\u2019s, he has refused to talk to the press. \u201cI think they\u2019re a bunch of jerks,\u201d he declares, \u201cTo hell with them.\u201d\nBut he has agreed to talk now, because he feels his side of the story has not been told. He is not quite sure I am the one to tell it, but after weeks of phone calls with him and his lawyers, I have been invited to his home.\nI am surprised that he has agreed to see me without his lawyers, while the suit filed by Chin\u2019s mother is still pending and while he continues his suit for wrongful discharge against Chrysler.\nBut then, this is the man who has toughed it out against virtually the entire Asian-American community, outraged by what it felt like was a too-small penalty for the death of Chin.\nEbena and his stepson Michael Nitz were fined $3,780 and given three years probation for the death by Wayne County Circuit Court Judge Charles Kaufman in March, 1983 after Ebens pleaded guilty and Nitz pleaded no contest to manslaughter.\nThen the U.S. Department of Justice filed civil rights charges and gained a conviction from a federal court jury in Detroit in 1984 on the charge that he violated Vincent Chin\u2019s civil rights. The jury concluded that Ebens beat Chin because of his ancestry. Ebens was acquitted on the second charge, that he had conspired to deprive Chin of his civil rights. Nitz was acquitted on both charges.\nU.S. District Judge Anna Diggs Taylor sentenced Ebens to 25 years in prison, but the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the conviction. Taylor ordered a change of venue to Cincinnati and reheard the case there. In May, the second jury acquitted him, thus ending any further criminal prosecution of Ronald Ebens.\nIf he got through all of this without a scratch, what harm could an interview do? As he sees it, \u201cThe guy who walks away without getting hurt is the guy who has won.\u201d\nBy his standards, Ronald Ebens has been winning a lot lately, and talks that way. \u201cIf he (Chin) hadn\u2019t started it, he\u2019d still be alive,\u201d says Ebens. \u201cI mean, don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right that he died. All I\u2019m saying is that if he hadn\u2019t started it, he\u2019d still be alive. They were looking for trouble and they got it.\u201d\nRewind to June 19, 1982. Vincent Chin, a 27-year-old engineer from Oak Park, is celebrating his upcoming marriage.\nAlthough accounts of some details of what happened vary slightly among some of the people associated with the incident, this is apparently what happened on that night, based on court records, interviews, and published reports.\nChin and three friends, Jimmy Choi, Gary Koviu and Robert Siroskey, decide to go to the Fancy Pants Lounge on Woodward Avenue in Highland Park. Two dancers, one white and one black, are performing a strip tease on an elevated runway in front of the bar. Across the runway sit Ronald Ebens, a general foreman at Chrysler, and his stepson, Michael Nitz, a laid-off Chrysler worker who is now working in a furniture store and going to school part-time.\nAfter watching Chin give a generous tip to the white dancer, Ebens becomes agitated. \u201cHey, you little m\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013!\u201d he shouts at Chin, telling the black dancer, \u201cDon\u2019t pay any attention to those little f\u2014\u2014, they wouldn\u2019t know a good dancer if they\u2019d seen one.\u201d At that point, Chin gets up from his seat and starts towards Ebens.\n\u201cLittle f\u2014\u2013, big f\u2014\u2013, we\u2019re all the same,\u201d Ebens says to Chin. Chin apparently does not appreciate the comment and hauls off and slugs him. A fight ensues, the black dancer hears Ebens or Ntiz say something about \u201cyou guys (referring to Chin and Choi) are the reason we\u2019re all laid off,\u201d and Ebens lifts a chair to strike Chin. He cracks his stepson\u2019s head instead. The owner breaks it up and tosses everyone out.\nIn the parking lot, words are exchanged again. Chin calls Ebens a \u201cchicken s\u2014\u201d and Nitz goes to his car trunk, opens it, and pulls out a Louisville Slugger baseball bat. Chin and his friends run down the street, as Ebens and Nitz, according to the indictment, offer James Perry $20 to help them go find the \u201cChinaman.\u201d\nAfter cruising Woodward for about 10 minutes, they spot Chin sitting outside the McDonald\u2019s restaurant on the wooden railroad ties which pass for landscaping at the popular Highland Park hangout. Nitz pulls into the lot and, before he stops the car, Ebens swings the door open and jumps out. The rear tire of Nitz\u2019s Plymouth Horizon accidentally runs over Ebens\u2019 foot and comes to rest on top of it. \u201cEither pull up or back off \u2018cause you\u2019re sitting on my foot!\u201d Ebens yells. He pries loose his foot and starts running towards Chin, bat in hand.\nChin sees him coming and runs out into the street. Nitz has joined the chase, and within seconds catches Chin and holds him while Ebens cocks the bat and smashes it into Chin\u2019s legs. Chin screams in pain, and as he falls to the pavement, Ebens\u2019 second swing scores a direct hit to his chest, breaking a number of ribs. Now bleeding and crumpled in the middle of Woodward Avenue, Chin looks up into the light from the golden Arches as Ronald Ebens strikes a third time, this time on the skull. Vincent Chin does not move.\nTwo dozen people eating their Big Macs and Quarter-Pounders, including two off-duty Detroit police officers, watch the entire scene as Ebens continues to bash the unconscious Chin. Chin\u2019s friends have long since fled, leaving him alone to face Ebens and his bat. The officers run out and break things up. Realizing what he had just done, Ebens tells the policemen, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hurt him that bad.\u201d\nHe and his stepson are taken to the Highland Park police station and later released without being charged.\nThe following day Ebens and Nitz go to work. After four days in a coma, Vincent Chin dies. Ebens\u2019 wife, Juanita, hears from a friend at the hospital that Chin\u2019s life support systems have been turned off. She waits until Ebens has finished his supper before she breaks the news.\n\u201cVincent died today,\u201d she says calmly. Ebens puts down his fork, finishes chewing his food and is silent for a long time. He does not cry.\nIt is now almost five years later to the day. Ronald Ebens leans back in his easy chair, cranks the handle that produces the retractable stool, and pleads for a little understanding.\n\u201cPeople are wrong about me, period,\u201d he says. \u201cI am not the way I\u2019ve been made out to be. I\u2019m easy, you know. I\u2019m a pushover. I\u2019m a pussycat.\u201d These words do not flow effortlessly from Ebens\u2019 mouth.\n\u201cI\u2019m a macho, and it\u2019s hard for me to admit that I\u2019m really just a pussycat.\u201d He is not, he insists, some maniac who, \u201cjust goes down clearing the streets of Asians.\u201d\nEbens\u2019 memory is fuzzy about the night he killed Chin, but he does have a clear recollection of Chin\u2019s friend, Jimmy Choi. \u201cThis little Jimmy Choi,\u201d he recalls, \u201che\u2019s like a little pest, that\u2019s what he amounted to. He was just running back and forth, running his mouth, just keeping things agitated. He was one of those little guys that just \u2014 hey, you ever see this commercial on TV with the two dogs? That Kibbles \u2018N\u2019 Bits commercial with the little dog jumping over the big dog, saying, \u2018Come on, Spike! C\u2019mon Spike!\u2019 That\u2019s what that guy reminded me of.\u201d\nEbens\u2019 voice is filled with contempt, and he sweeps his fingers off the top of his thumb, the way one flicks away a particle of something unpleasant.\nI ask him about how he killed Chin.\n\u201cHe took off running, and I hollered at him, \u2018You son of a bitch!\u2019 He ran out into the street and Mike (Nitz) ran right into him and grabbed him. I think I probably hit Chin in the leg or something, and the only thing that\u2019s ever made any sense in my mind is that, as he started to go down, I must have caught him in the head (with the bat).\u201d\n\u201cAll I wanted to do was inflict a little injury, to get even for Mike\u2019s split head.\u201d\nEbens grows very quiet. His concentration is broken by a small army of red ants crawling on the end table beside his chair. \u201cDamn, would you look at this!\u201d he says to his wife. \u201cWhere did these things come from?\u201d With his fingers he begins to crush the ants, one by one, wiping their residue on his jeans.\n\u201cI just don\u2019t like ants \u2014 the little suckers,\u201d he says.\n\u201cLittle suckers, like \u2018little f\u2014\u2014?\u2019\u201d I ask. Ebens smiles and looks nervously at the tape recorder I have running.\n\u201cI gotta get some spray,\u201d he says, cranking the handle of his chair. \u201cSay, you look so familiar to me. I\u2019ve seen you somewhere before.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I say.\nWayne County Circuit Judge Charles Kaufman\u2019s decision to let Ebens and Nitz go with a $3,780 fine decision enraged the Asian-American community throughout the country. The American Citizens for Justice was formed to pressure Kaufman into reconsidering the sentence, which he eventually refused to do. Ronald Ebens has a vivid memory of the day he was to be sentenced.\n\u201cI told my wife that morning she might as well put a stamp on my a\u2013 \u2018cause they were going to be sending me away. (When Kaufman announced the sentence) you could have knocked me over with a feather.\u201d\nIt was from that moment, that Ebens believes he, \u201cbecame a symbol for the Chinese. It was totally uncalled for. They were trying to hang me. What would have been gained by sending me to prison except to appease them?\u201d\n\u201cThey blew it (the killing) all out of proportion. Vincent and I were just in the wrong place at the wrong time, and it\u2019s too bad, you know, especially for him. At least I\u2019m alive.\u201d\n\u201cBut they (the Asian-American groups) used the press, they used the federal government, they sued everybody on this thing. I don\u2019t know who the hell they are, and I have absolutely no use for them.\u201d Ebens notices that the level of his voice has risen a few decibels and he quickly regains a modicum of composure.\n\u201cI don\u2019t hold the Asian mass responsible for the actions of these few people,\u201d he adds, in a forgiving tone.\nEbens contends that the Asian-American groups put him through \u201cfour years of hell with a bunch of damn lies.\u201d he denies that he said anything of a racial nature to Chin that night. He has tape recordings his lawyers subpoenaed from the American Citizens for Justice (ACJ) which seem to indicate that the Asian-American group sought to influence the witnesses to tell a consistent story on the stand. On the tapes, the attorney for the ACJ, Liza Chan, can be heard apparently trying to coax Choi, Koivu, and Siroskey into corroborating each other\u2019s statements. Only after Kaufman\u2019s sentencing of Ebens \u2014 and his meeting with Liza Chan \u2014 did Jimmy Choi claim to have heard Ebens make ethnic slurs against Vincent Chin.\nContrary to what he calls these \u201clies\u201d about racist remarks, Ebens says he was actually upset at Chin for discriminating against the black dancer by giving her the smaller tip, and that he was acting as sort of a one-man civil rights commission at the Fancy Pants.\n\u201cThis black girl dancing was a knockout, OK? Now if you think Mike and I are going to be sitting there making comments about the car industry with her dancing there, well, you got to be some kind of wimp. I mean, get serious.\u201d\nThe ants return to the end of the table, this time in force. For the remainder of the interview, Ebens gently picks them off, five or six at a time.\nRonald Ebens was born and raised on a farm in northern Illinois. Married at the age of 18, \u201cjust like everybody else,\u201d he spent 2 & 1/2 years at the Army Air Defense School. When the Vietnam war began, he wanted \u201cno part of it,\u201d so he decided not to re-enlist. He came home to Illinois and went to work for Chrysler in Belvedere. A promotion brought about his move to Detroit, and, after divorcing his first wife, he married Juanita in 1971. Eventually he was made a superintendent. He had 17 years seniority within the company when he was fired after his conviction.\nEbens believes he has been made to suffer because the Asian-American community needed a cause to rally around. \u201cTo put somebody through what I\u2019ve been through, just for a cause, that\u2019s wrong,\u201d he says, shaking his head and clenching his fist.\nAlthough Ronald Ebens never spent a day behind bars, it would not be entirely accurate to say that he hasn\u2019t been punished. First, he was fired from Chrysler, \u201cbecause,\u201d he says, \u201cthe company didn\u2019t want to take any flak.\u201d He is bitter that after, \u201cbeing told from 6 o\u2019clock in the morning to 6 o\u2019clock at night for 17 years that we\u2019re a team, we pull together, we take a pay cut, we have all this s\u2014 beat into us and then what do they do\u2026?\u201d He takes his right hand and brings it down hard on his other hand, creating a loud POP! \u201cSomebody\u2019s a loyal employee, you never fire them.\u201d\nEbens has not worked for five years. He has spent most of his time around the house while his wife has worked at the furniture store where her son, Mike Nitz, is employed. \u201cImagine what this has been like for me,\u201d he asks. \u201cEvery day I have to get up and put my life back together again.\u201d He says he has grown very depressed at times, even suicidal, and has sought the help of a \u201cpsychologist friend who has taught me a few tricks on how to deal with the stress, like lifting weights and running.\u201d He says he didn\u2019t commit suicide because he didn\u2019t want to, \u201cgive anybody the satisfaction of thinking, \u2018Man, we made the guy give up.\u2019 I\u2019m just not a quitter.\u201d\nRonald Ebens believes he has beaten \u201cthe cause,\u201d and the cause was him. I ask him why he thinks the Asian-American groups would want to use him in this way.\n\u201cTo show the plight of the Asian-American in America,\u201d he responds. What is that plight, I inquire. \u201cHey, I didn\u2019t even know there was one, that\u2019s how dumb I am. I still don\u2019t know what their plight is. Obviously, they\u2019re shooting for something.\u201d I ask him what they are shooting for. He is becoming perturbed.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 Do you see any Asian-Americans around here? I don\u2019t even know them. I don\u2019t know what their plight is. I\u2019ve never been around them. The only ones I had ever met are the ones in the Chinese restaurants, and they were always nice and I was always nice to them.\u201d\nRonald Ebens believes that, \u201ceverybody has some racist feelings \u2014 you, the Chinese, everyone. I can\u2019t honestly say I harbor any feelings against any ethnic group, OK? That doesn\u2019t mean I want to live with them, OK?\u201d\nIn East Detroit, where Ebens lives, (and he wants it noted that East Detroit is not the east side of Detroit \u2014 \u201cNo way, we\u2019re like Roseville\u201d) there are, by his count, only three black families. Juanita points out that somebody has accused the East Detroit police department of discriminating because it has no blacks on the force.\n\u201cWell, if we\u2019re supposed to hire on a percentage basis,\u201d Ebens observes with a chuckle, \u201cthen they got just enough (black officers).\u201d He stresses that he is not absolutely opposed to affirmative action and feels it is needed \u201csomeplace like down in Alabama where they have been passed over just because they were black. But then it is taken to the other extreme where they are promoted over the white guy who has a higher score and stuff, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right at all.\u201d\nThe white-guy-as-victim syndrome has become Ronald Ebens\u2019 reality. There were no racial comments made in the bar that night, he insists. He was not thinking about the decline of the American auto industry or Japanese imports while Racine, the dancer, shed her bikini top.\nHe was, he says, only having a good time. But when asked about his feelings concerning imports, he admits that it bothers him, \u201cand if it don\u2019t bother you, then you\u2019re awfully stupid. \u2026 The American people, as a whole, should wise up and just realize that we got to do better, period. That\u2019s the answer. Shame on us for just letting them beat us. We give them the technology and then let them beat us with it. Sure, it\u2019s our own damn fault.\u201d\nThe Asians, he concludes, \u201call stick together. Why don\u2019t white people stick together? Huh? Not \u2018til we\u2019re a minority?\u201d\nI rise to leave as his 16-year-old daughter comes into the home and asks Ebens for a couple of dollars. Like most dads on most blocks he asks the obligatory, \u201cWhat for?\u201d as he is already reaching into his pocket.\nTomorrow will be much like today and all the others since he killed Vincent Chin. He will sit in his recliner and watch TV. The drapes will be drawn and it will be dark inside. Meanwhile, off in Washington D.C., 10 members of Congress were preparing to pose for photos as they demolish a brand-new Toshiba boom box, demanding that the U.S. cease being a \u201ccolony of Japan.\u201d They would swing their bats with a gusto that would have put Ronald Ebens to shame.\nAs Ebens shows me to the door, he grasps my right hand firmly and, with his other arm, gives me a big, friendly squeeze. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t look like some killer, do I?\u201d\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014"

Eaman (argued), Detroit, Mich., for defendant-appellant.\nMaura D. Corrigan, Asst. U.S. Atty., Detroit, Mich., Wm. Bradford Reynolds, Walter W. Barnett, Dennis J. Dimsey, Civil Rights Div., Dept. of Justice, Washington, D.C., Dennis J. Dimsey (argued), Bethesda, Md., for plaintiff-appellee.\nBefore ENGEL, KENNEDY and MILBURN, Circuit Judges.\nENGEL, Circuit Judge.\nRonald Ebens appeals from a judgment of conviction and a twenty-five year sentence following his conviction by a jury of count II of a two count indictment charging him and his stepson Michael Nitz under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 245(b) (2) (F)1 with violating the civil rights of Vincent Chin, a United States citizen of Chinese descent. Ebens had killed Chin in an altercation which occurred on June 19, 1982.\nWe cannot permit the judgment to stand because Ebens was denied a fair trial.\nEbens was originally prosecuted in the Wayne County, Michigan, Circuit Court and prior to trial pleaded guilty to the crime of manslaughter. When he was placed upon probation and fined $3,720, public outrage at the perceived lenity of the penalty was extensive, especially within the Chinese-American community. The case was accompanied by massive publicity at both the state and national levels and undoubtedly because of activity on behalf of the Chinese-American community, the United States Department of Justice, overruling the decision of the local United States Attorney not to prosecute, instituted proceedings under the Civil Rights Act in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.\nWe address the issues in the order in which they have been raised by appellant and the facts are further developed as pertinent to each issue.\nEbens claims that the trial court erred in failing to grant his motion for change of venue.\nEbens had originally moved the district court for an eight to twelve month continuance of the trial in order to permit the effect of the extensive publicity surrounding the case to dissipate. Before that motion was decided, Ebens on February 17, 1984, filed a motion for change of venue.\nThe joint appendix filed in the appellate record contains sixty-eight pages of articles from Detroit newspapers about the Chin matter. Three video tape recordings of television broadcasts were also made a part of the record. As the trial judge noted, the publicity was not only extensive but was all adverse. A Detroit attorney, Lisa Chan, formed a group known as The American Citizens for Justice, and appears to have been instrumental in publicizing the killing, the handling of the case by the Wayne County Prosecutor's office and the sentences given to Ebens and Nitz in the state court. Rallies were held and the publicity generated much television coverage including at least two special news stories on the subject and a program over national television as well. The public excoriation of the state trial judge who placed Ebens and Nitz on probation was particularly severe. The headlines can only be described as scathing. One large cartoon, appearing in The Detroit News, even showed the trial judge putting a baseball bat in one ear, as if it were a pencil, and sharpening it with a pencil sharpener installed in the opposite ear.\nWe have carefully reviewed the extensive record made of the publicity in the case and agree that it was indeed pervasive. The question of venue is made particularly difficult because of the framework in which the prosecution arose. The nearly unanimous public judgment that Ebens and his stepson should have received jail terms and the harsh criticism of the state trial judge, followed by the federal prosecution of defendants based upon the same incident, was bound to lead to a strong public impression that justice had not been done in the state court and that it was incumbent upon the federal government to right that wrong by a second prosecution. Nevertheless we are unable to hold that the trial judge committed error when she determined to proceed to impanel a jury. While it probably would have been advisable for the trial judge to have ordered a change of venue, we conclude that it was not reversible error for her to proceed to impanel the jury. A change of venue would undoubtedly have occasioned great inconvenience both to the defense and to the government. Further, the publicity was so extensive that it was not altogether certain that any location to which the trial might be removed would itself be free from the potential impact of the publicity which had already occurred and that which was bound to accompany the trial, wherever it was held.\nWe are further persuaded in our holding by our observation that the process for selecting the jury was carried out with exceptional care and sensitivity. Prior to voir dire, each potential juror was required to complete a seven page questionnaire containing forty-two questions. In addition to the usual inquiries bearing upon a juror's potential bias generally, the jurors were specifically asked to set down what they knew about the Chin case and what the source of that knowledge was. Of the one hundred fifty-nine potential jurors who were ultimately examined on voir dire by the court and counsel, seventy-eight were excused for cause, the vast majority of them by the court on its own motion. Ebens' counsel moved to exclude only four jurors for cause. Of the seventy-eight excused for cause, thirty-four were excused because they acknowledged that they were unable to disregard the publicity. Thirteen of the one hundred fifty-nine potential jurors stated that they had not been exposed to any publicity. All of those ultimately seated were carefully questioned concerning their ability to hear the evidence in the case free of any prior knowledge of the case through the media. Of the thirteen ultimately seated, three had no prior knowledge and ten possessed some knowledge but satisfied the court that they would be able to hear the case free of any bias as a result of that knowledge. Each defendant was allotted twenty peremptory challenges. Counsel for Ebens exercised seven peremptory challenges (although the trial judge understood that the defense had exercised only five).\nBoth government and defense rely upon Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751 (1961), to support their positions concerning the necessity for a change of venue. The trial court specifically found that the jurors chosen were free of bias. It is well settled that a juror's previous knowledge of the facts of the crime through the media is not itself dispositive of the issue of that juror's qualification to sit. The jury selection process was fair and in accord with the concerns expressed by the majority of our court in United States v. Blanton, 719 F.2d 815, 830 (6th Cir. 1983) (en banc), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1099, 104 S. Ct. 1592, 80 L. Ed. 2d 125 (1984), as well as those expressed by this writer in his dissent and cases cited therein. While we do not hold that the failure to exercise all of the allowed peremptory challenges, or failure to challenge for cause all of the jurors who were seated, is invariably fatal to a motion for a change of venue, certainly this factor is of great importance in determining whether the jury so selected was capable of meeting the demands of impartiality placed upon it by law.\nEbens next claims that he was entitled to a directed verdict of acquittal. We disagree.\nIn review of such issues, the court is of course obliged to consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S. Ct. 457, 86 L. Ed. 680 (1942); United States v. Adamo, 742 F.2d 927 (6th Cir. 1984), cert. denied sub nom. Freeman v. United States, 469 U.S. 1193, 105 S. Ct. 971, 83 L. Ed. 2d 975 (1985). Only if no rational jury could have convicted is it error not to grant the motion. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 99 S. Ct. 2781, 61 L. Ed. 2d 560, reh'g denied, 444 U.S. 890, 100 S. Ct. 195, 62 L. Ed. 2d 126 (1979). Ebens' motion in this regard must be considered in the light of the elements of the crime with which he was charged. His arguments go not to the factual events of the altercation itself and of his wielding the baseball bat which caused Chin's death, but to the specific intent which is inherently a part of the statute.\nEbens was acquitted of count I of the indictment charging him with conspiracy to deprive Chin of his civil rights under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241. He was convicted of count II charging him with interfering with Chin's civil rights by wilfully injuring, intimidating and interfering with Chin on account of his race or national origin and because the latter was and had been enjoying the privileges and accommodations of the Fancy Pants Lounge, a place of entertainment open to the public, by threatening, beating, and assaulting Chin with the result that the latter died, all in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 245(b) (2) (F).\nThe incident giving rise to this litigation occurred on June 19, 1982, in Highland Park, a suburb of Detroit. Chin, then twenty-seven years old, lived with his mother in Oak Park, Michigan, another suburb of Detroit. He had come to this country from China in 1961 when he was adopted by a Chinese-American couple. He became a United States citizen in 1965.\nTo celebrate his upcoming wedding, Chin invited his friends Robert Sirosky and Gary Koivu to meet him at a topless bar at 7:00 p.m. that night. After about an hour there and after having several drinks the group went on to the Fancy Pants Lounge, a nude dancing establishment in Highland Park. En route they purchased a pint of vodka and it is rather apparent from the record that they were in a mood of elevated joviality in consequence. Koivu later left to pick up one Jimmy Choi, another of Chin's friends, and together they brought another bottle of vodka into the Fancy Pants. The group was laughing, tipping the dancers heavily, and generally celebrating. At that time Ronald Ebens and his stepson, Michael Nitz, were also at the Fancy Pants, sitting directly across the elevated dancing runway from Chin and his friends. Construing the evidence most favorably to the government, Ebens began making racial and obscene remarks toward Chin calling him a \"Chink\" and a \"Nip\" and making remarks about foreign car imports. It is apparent that Ebens seemed to believe that Chin was Japanese and he was quoted as having made the further comment that \"it's because of you little mother fuckers that we're out of work.\" Ebens may not have distinguished between Orientals of Japanese and Chinese descent since there is testimony to show he made references to both. After a further exchange of words Chin got out of his chair and walked up to the stage where Ebens was sitting and there was general jostling and fighting between Ebens and Chin in which Nitz then joined. The doorman and the parking lot attendant broke up the fight. The parking lot attendant took Chin outside and the doorman took Ebens and Nitz to the men's room. The doorman got a towel and some ice for Nitz who was bleeding from a cut on the head and later escorted Ebens and Nitz outside. The quarrel resumed outside the Fancy Pants Lounge. Chin challenged Ebens to finish the fight outside, calling him names. Ebens thereupon went to Nitz's car, opened the hatchback and removed a baseball bat. Seeing Ebens with a bat, Chin fled across Woodward Avenue and was pursued a short distance by both Ebens and Nitz.\nWhile still in the Fancy Pants parking lot, Chin's three friends had decided that Choi would join Chin across Woodward Avenue and that Koivu and Sirosky would get their car and pick him up. Ebens and Nitz drove by in their car and, seeing Sirosky and Koivu, stopped and asked where their friend was. When they said they didn't know, Ebens then saw Choi and started after him. Nitz threw a glass bottle at Choi, and Ebens and Nitz returned to their car and drove off after Choi. After driving about a block from the Fancy Pants, Sirosky and Koivu stopped the car, removed a tire iron from the trunk and headed back toward the Fancy Pants. Unexpectedly they came upon Nitz's car which was parked on Woodward Avenue. Ebens got out of the car with the baseball bat and chased Sirosky and Koivu a short distance before getting back into Nitz's car. Meanwhile, after Choi had crossed Woodward Avenue he found Chin and suggested that they should flee. The two then ran south on Woodward Avenue for a few blocks until they stopped at a McDonald's restaurant where they apparently sought protection in the crowd, also hoping that Koivu and Sirosky would find them. Choi picked up a piece of wood for protection and handed Chin an unbroken bottle. Ebens and Nitz continued to look for Chin and upon meeting one Jimmy Perry, Nitz offered Perry $20 to help him find and catch a \"Chinese guy.\"\nAccording to Perry's testimony Ebens and Nitz talked during the ride about catching a \"Chinese guy\" and \"busting his head\" when they caught him.\nThe final confrontation occurred in the lot of a supermarket next to McDonald's. Ebens and Nitz approached Chin and Choi using a parked truck for cover. Ebens was still carrying the baseball bat. Chin saw them coming and yelled \"Scram.\" Choi escaped but Nitz grabbed Chin in a bear hug from behind. Chin broke loose and ran onto Woodward Avenue. Ebens struck Chin several times with the bat on the back and head causing Chin to fall to the ground. While the precise circumstances of the assault are in dispute, especially whether Nitz was holding Chin at the time, it is undisputed that Ebens was the aggressor. Meanwhile, the Highland Park police officers who were working as security guards at McDonald's came up, drew their guns and ordered Ebens to drop his bat.\nChin was taken to Henry Ford Hospital, losing consciousness several times en route. He suffered two lacerations on the back left side of his head and abrasions on his shoulder, chest and neck and lapsed into a severe coma. After the performance of emergency surgery his brain ceased functioning entirely. At 9:50 p.m. June 23, 1982, a ventilator which had been employed to keep him breathing was removed and he was pronounced dead.\nIn claiming that there was insufficient evidence to convict him of a violation of section 245, Ebens essentially admits the physical facts of the assault. He nonetheless claims that what transpired was simply a barroom brawl which got out of hand and resulted in the death of one of the participants and injuries to another. He claims that there is an absence of any evidence by which the jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt (1) that he was motivated because of the race, color and national origin of Vincent Chin and (2) that his purpose was to injure, intimidate, and interfere with Vincent Chin's right to enjoy a place of public accommodation. He disclaimed the racial nature of the remarks attributed to him and asserted that the fight arose over Chin's insulting treatment of one of the dancers. He also claimed that the actual physical contact was initiated by Chin both in the Lounge and outside when Chin waited outside for Ebens to emerge and then challenged him to a fight.\nWe do not agree with Ebens' initial contention that, in enacting section 245, Congress intended to limit its application exclusively to vindicate the rights of blacks and of white civil rights workers who aid blacks but not to alleged discrimination against citizens of Oriental descent by whites. Section 245(b) (2) protects any person \"because of his race, color, religion or national origin\" from intimidation or interference in the enjoyment of the facilities or accommodations of any \"place of exhibition or entertainment which serves the public....\" Orientals come within the broad constitutional protections of the Fourteenth Amendment even though the original thrust of the amendments was primarily motivated by concern for the rights of black persons. See Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 6 S. Ct. 1064, 30 L. Ed. 220 (1886).\nEbens relies upon Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 65 S. Ct. 1031, 89 L. Ed. 1495 (1945) and United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745, 86 S. Ct. 1170, 16 L. Ed. 2d 239 (1966), as requiring proof of a specific intent to deprive a person of a federal right made definite by decisions or other rule of law. In interpreting the predecessor to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 242, the Supreme Court stated,\n[T]he specific intent required by the Act is an intent to deprive a person of a right which has been made specific either by express terms of the Constitution or laws of the United States or by decisions interpreting them.... Of course, willful conduct cannot make definite that which is undefined. But willful violators of constitutional requirements, which have been defined, certainly are in no position to say that they had no adequate advance notice that they would be visited with punishment.\"\nScrews, 325 U.S. at 104-05, 65 S. Ct. at 1036-37. Any deficiencies in the charge brought under section 241 need not concern us for Ebens was in all events acquitted of that charge. He was convicted of section 245. As evidenced by its plain statutory language of section 245, the federal right itself is specifically spelled out: it includes the right to be free from intimidation or interference in the enjoyment of public facilities such as the Fancy Pants Lounge. The statute does not suffer from lack of specificity.\nA jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Ebens, in initiating the ultimate conduct by uncomplimentary remarks toward Chin, was motivated by his belief that Chin was Japanese, not Chinese. The jury could have believed that this color and race-based or national origin bias against Chin induced Ebens to make the comments he did and that he was further irritated when he saw Chin enjoying himself in the lounge and spending money freely. The jury could further have found that his remarks were intended to make Chin's remaining on the premises uncomfortable and embarrassing and to intimidate and dissuade him from remaining on the premises because of that bias.\nIt is true that the ultimate assault which caused Chin's demise may also have been motivated by Chin's injury of Ebens' stepson, but defense counsel acknowledges that a specific intent to violate federal law need not have been the first among several evil intents. See, e.g., Anderson v. United States, 417 U.S. 211, 94 S. Ct. 2253, 41 L. Ed. 2d 20 (1974) (dealing with section 241); United States v. Bledsoe, 728 F.2d 1094 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 838, 105 S. Ct. 136, 83 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1984) (a substantial motivating factor).\nWe find no merit in the claim that the prosecution must fail because of an absence of direct evidence that the beating in front of McDonald's restaurant related to Chin's race or the fact that he had been in a place of public accommodation earlier. A rational jury could have found that the events at McDonald's were the culmination of a single and basically inseparable incident. It was altogether proper for the jury to consider this evidence and the comments made by Ebens as bearing upon his specific intent.\nEbens claims that the trial court committed reversible error in refusing to permit the admission of certain evidence which was offered by Ebens to impeach the government's witnesses. Specifically, two types of evidence are involved.\nAs we have stated, after the state court sentencing, Lisa Chan, a Detroit attorney, formed a group known as the American Citizens for Justice and appears to have been instrumental in publicizing the killing and the handling of the case by the Wayne County prosecutor's office. Ms. Chan traveled to Washington, D.C., to discuss the matter with William Bradford Reynolds, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice with respect to the possibility of federal prosecution. Rallies were held in Detroit, in which the protestors carried placards reading \"Jail the racist killers\" and \"It's not fair,\" the latter a comment made by Chin before he lapsed into unconsciousness. It is undisputed that the events occurring after the state court sentencing received widespread publicity.\nThe three principal government witnesses were Choi, Sirosky, and Koivu. All testified, in one form or another, concerning the incident and the statements purportedly made by Ebens in the course of the evening from which racism could be found.\nEbens and codefendant Nitz sought to introduce into evidence tape recordings of interviews which had been conducted by Lisa Chan with these witnesses. The defense purpose was to demonstrate that the witnesses' testimony concerning Ebens' racist statements was false and that it was the result of improper coaching of them by Chan in preparation for the trial. He claimed that the tapes were admissible to show collusion, witness influence, and prior inconsistent statements. Each time the defendants sought to introduce the tapes, however, the court sustained the government objection on hearsay grounds, ruling however that the defense counsel could confront a witness who takes the stand with his own words on the tape but that the statements of Lisa Chan to the witness which elicited that witness' statement could only be introduced through her should she be called. The government concedes that these rulings were erroneous.\nThe government correctly notes in its brief on appeal that the definition of hearsay under the federal rules requires that the third party statement testified to by the witness in question be offered for the purpose of proving the truth of the matter asserted. Fed.R.Evid. 801(c); United States v. Gibson, 675 F.2d 825 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 972, 103 S. Ct. 305, 74 L. Ed. 2d 285 (1982). Obviously the purpose of introducing the Chan tapes was to show the effect of Chan's statements on the testimony of Choi, Sirosky, and Koivu. Plainly, Chan's out of court utterances were admissible to show not the truth of what she said but the effect on Choi, Sirosky and Koivu as bearing on whether the witnesses' subsequent sworn testimony was coached and hence inaccurate. See 4 Weinstein's Evidence p 801(c), at 801-77 to -80 (1985). In this light, the tapes were highly relevant and important to the defense.\nThe defense did use the transcripts of the tapes to some extent during the trial. Counsel for Ebens examined Koivu concerning the purpose of his meeting with Chan. Koivu replied, \"Well, she wanted to get an idea of what happened, just to get the flavor of the night, to get an idea of what happened.\" The defense also questioned Koivu about specific responses he had made to Chan's questions. In the interview, Koivu expressed fear that his testimony, as well as that of Choi and Sirosky, would sound too rehearsed. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Koivu whether he had expressed this fear to which he replied, \"In a way.\"\nIn cross-examining Robert Sirosky, the defense again attempted to prove two prior inconsistent statements by reciting questions asked by Ms. Chan and the responses given by Sirosky. However, the most extensive use of the Chan tapes was during the testimony of Jimmy Choi. Defense counsel sought to discredit Choi's testimony that he heard racial slurs by introducing a portion of the Chan tapes. In this portion Choi suggested to Lisa Chan that he did not hear any racial slurs made by Ebens on the night of the fight. When he denied making any such statement, defense counsel read Chan's questions and Choi's responses. Later in Choi's cross-examination, the defense used the transcript of the tapes to refresh Choi's recollection.\nThe government relies upon our decision in United States v. Touchstone, 726 F.2d 1116 (6th Cir. 1984). In that case a panel of our court held that cross-examination of a witness may properly be restricted under the rules limiting the use of other acts evidence in impeachment of witnesses where, notwithstanding the limitation, there is otherwise sufficient evidence presented to the jury to enable it to make a \"discriminating appraisal\" of the credibility of such witnesses.\nThe erroneous exclusion of testimony on grounds of hearsay is reversible error if the reviewing court finds that such error affects the substantial rights of the defendant. Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a). United States v. Parry, 649 F.2d 292 (5th Cir. 1981); United States v. Barrett, 539 F.2d 244 (1st Cir. 1976). In these cases, the convictions were reversed and the cases remanded for new trials upon a finding that the erroneous hearsay rulings resulted in the exclusion of testimony favorable to the defendants. Both cases relied upon Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 66 S. Ct. 1239, 90 L. Ed. 1557 (1946), for the proposition that the erroneous hearsay ruling constitutes reversible error where it affects substantial rights. Kotteakos held that in considering whether the ruling has such an effect, \" [n]ecessarily the character of the proceedings, what is at stake upon its outcome, and the relation of the error asserted to casting the balance for decision on the case as a whole, are material factors in judgment.\" Id. at 762, 66 S. Ct. at 1246.\nWe unanimously conclude that a consideration of these cited factors mandates reversal.\nEbens should have been permitted to introduce into evidence the entire contents of the tapes at least insofar as they involved conversations occurring at the time the government witnesses were present. The three witnesses were the most crucial of all witnesses for the government. Each testified as to events inside the Fancy Pants Lounge and to verbal exchanges between Ebens and Chin. The Chan tapes were offered to support Ebens' claim that Choi, Koivu and Sirosky did not tell the truth when they testified that they heard the racial statements. Since the physical facts of the assault were essentially undisputed, the entire defense hung upon Ebens' claim that the fight was not racially motivated. It is true that the district court permitted the defense to elicit the statements made in interviews and did allow a few of the statements, but it was not within the province of the court's proper discretion to prevent the jury from hearing the tapes themselves and judging for themselves the impact upon the witnesses which the purported conversation had and measuring that against the statements made in court by the witnesses.2 The defense has called our attention to a First Circuit opinion, authored by Chief Judge Campbell, which states the case well:\n\"We know of no case holding or even suggesting, and the government has cited none, that counsel must introduce testimony in a manner so as to avoid evidentiary problems. It is the essence of our adversary system that counsel, not the court, chooses how evidence is to be presented. Trial tactics and strategy are the responsibility of counsel. Counsel offers the testimony; the court determines its admissibility based on the rules of evidence, not whether an alternative method of introducing it would be preferable. Particularly in a criminal case, a defendant cannot be penalized by the exclusion of otherwise admissible testimony because his counsel has chosen to proceed in a manner which requires a difficult ruling by the court. * * * We also note that, given a choice, defense counsel in a criminal case might well want to avoid calling [hostile witnesses] even though rebuttal testimony is available.\"\nUnited States v. Ouimette, 753 F.2d 188, 192 (1st Cir. 1985).\nEbens next asserts that the trial court erred in permitting the testimony of government witness Willie Davis concerning events which allegedly occurred and were observed by him in 1974 in a Detroit bar by the name of Jo-Jo's. It was the government's theory that a tall blond man named Ron harassed Willie Davis, a black, inside the bar and that the tall blond man was Ronald Ebens. Davis testified that he went into Jo-Jo's Bar to talk with the owner and that three white men entered after him. One of the three addressed another as Ron. Davis then testified that \"Ron said something about niggers.\" Although Davis said that he did not pay much attention to the statement, the owner's wife suggested that Davis leave. When Davis asked whether she was speaking to him, Ron said, \"yes, nigger, she's talking to you.\" Davis further testified that the men made other racial remarks. It was the government's theory that the Ron in Jo-Jo's Bar was the defendant Ronald Ebens and it introduced the testimony for the purpose of showing that Ebens generally was possessed of a bigoted mind and that he therefore possessed the requisite intent under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 245 when he assaulted Chin.\nWe are convinced that it was reversible error for the trial court to have admitted this testimony, for several reasons. Courts may admit evidence of prior bad acts if the proof shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant did in fact commit the act. United States v. Leonard, 524 F.2d 1076, 1090-91 (2d Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 958, 96 S. Ct. 1737, 48 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1976).\nEbens challenges the Davis testimony on two bases. First he asserts that the prior event was too remote in time to be relevant to this case. Second, he claims that Davis' identification of Ebens was too indefinite to be probative. We agree particularly with the second argument and conclude it was error to have permitted such testimony and also, once elicited, to have refused to strike it.\nThe government, in defense of the propriety of its calling Willie Davis, relies upon the admissibility of his testimony under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) to show that Ebens had committed prior similar acts. Rule 404(b) provides:\nOther crimes, wrongs, or acts. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\nFed.R.Evid. 404(b). Case law in our circuit has been quite supportive of the broad discretion accorded the trial judge in determining whether such other acts evidence is admissible against a defendant in a criminal case. See United States v. Dabish, 708 F.2d 240, 243 (6th Cir. 1983); United States v. Vincent, 681 F.2d 462, 465 (6th Cir. 1982) and cases cited therein. While our court in Vincent had no occasion on the facts before it to choose between a \"clear and convincing\" standard for admission of such evidence of prior acts or whether to adopt what it characterized as a minority view that it was admissible if \"sufficient to support a finding\" that the act was committed, see also Dabish, 708 F.2d at 243 n. 2, the court there found that in any event the prior acts had been established \"beyond doubt.\" Here, it was an abuse of discretion under either test to have admitted the testimony. The proof that Ebens was the same man as the Ron in the bar some eight years earlier was entirely too unreliable to justify its use against him in any event.\nThe following language from Vincent, also cited with approval in Dabish, illuminates what we consider to be the proper approach to an evaluation of testimony whose admission is sought under Rule 404(b):\nIn reviewing the admission of evidence challenged under Rule 404(b), we must make two determinations. First, we must decide whether Vincent's post-arrest conduct was admissible for any proper purpose, as distinct from the improper purpose of showing \"character\" or \"propensity.\" United States v. Cooper, 577 F.2d 1079, 1088 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 868, 99 S. Ct. 196, 58 L. Ed. 2d 179 (1978). If we conclude that there was a proper basis for admission, we must then consider whether the probative value of the evidence outweighed its potential prejudicial effects. See advisory committee note to Subdivision (b); United States v. Ring, 513 F.2d 1001 (6th Cir. 1975). In the second instance, the standard of review on appeal is whether the trial judge abused his discretion in admitting the evidence. United States v. Czarnicki [sic], 552 F.2d 698 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 939, 97 S. Ct. 2652, 53 L. Ed. 2d 257 (1977).\nVincent, 681 F.2d at 465.\nThe \"other acts\" which the government would have attributed to defendant Ebens were statements containing racial slurs cast at the witness Davis on account of his race and reference to him as a \"nigger.\" The government sought to persuade the jury that the party who made that statement was Ebens and that the reference to \"nigger\" evidenced a specific prejudice against minorities generally. Had the statement been made in the recent past and against someone of Oriental extraction, a strong case might have been made for the admission of such testimony under 404(b). A jury could then rationally have concluded that the racially insulting words were intended to persuade a patron to leave the bar. Further, the testimony at least by Davis, was that he was asked to leave, presumably to avoid the risk of further confrontation.3 The difficulty is that the comments about which Davis testified were directed to someone of a different race and were substantially remote in time, having happened in 1973 or 1974 whereas the incident in question occurred in 1982.\nMore serious, however, is the failure to establish by any standard that Ebens had in fact been present at Jo-Jo's Bar at the time of the statements and if so had been the person who had made them. The government agents and government counsel obviously believed they were one and the same and that Davis' reluctance to testify on behalf of the government and against Ebens was induced by fear and intimidation. The difficulty is that there was no testimony to support this belief. Inferences to the contrary although implicit in the unsworn questions were not corroborated by sworn answers.\nIt was apparent that the government attorney had had a prior conversation with Davis and the form of the prosecutor's questions suggested that an extra-judicial statement had been made by Davis at the time which was inconsistent with his statement at trial. That statement, however, was never introduced in evidence and we do not know what it was or whether it was shown to Davis. Davis admitted having talked to government agents but testified that he had refused to make statements and had insisted that he would talk only upon being subpoenaed. He admitted that he had been approached by defense counsel but likewise denied that he had been intimidated or threatened by them, contrary to the implications in the questions put to him by the government. He did claim that a person named Ron who was tall and blond had been among three men who had come into Jo-Jo's Bar on the night in question when certain demeaning statements had been made to him concerning his race. He steadfastly refused, however, to identify defendant Ebens as that same person.\nIt developed that Ronald Ebens had himself owned a bar known as Ron's Bar not too far from Davis' home and that he had opened it after the incident in Jo-Jo's Bar. The proof showed also that Davis had had occasion to go into Ron's Bar at least twice. He therefore readily admitted that he identified and knew Ronald Ebens but insisted that he was unable to identify the person named Ron who had several years previously come into Jo-Jo's Bar.\nThe end result was that the government failed to establish by either the weight of the evidence or by clear and convincing evidence that the \"other acts\" sought to be introduced were in fact those of defendant Ebens. Under the circumstances therefore we conclude that the application of the cited rule from Vincent should have led the trial court to a determination that the probative value of the evidence, if it possessed any at all, was in all events outweighed by its potential prejudicial effect. See United States v. McFadyen-Snider, 552 F.2d 1178, 1184 (6th Cir. 1977); United States v. Czarnecki, 552 F.2d 698, 702 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 939, 97 S. Ct. 2652, 53 L. Ed. 2d 257 (1977). See also United States v. Ismail, 756 F.2d 1253, 1259 (6th Cir. 1985), which requires that such evidence must be substantially similar and near in time to the offense charged in the indictment. We believe that this testimony is too remote in time, too uncertain in its authenticity, and in its application here was highly prejudicial to the rights of defendant Ebens.\nWhile the better course would in any event have been to make a special record before determining the admissibility of the evidence, thus keeping it from the jury altogether, cf. United States v. Robinson, 700 F.2d 205 (5th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 465 U.S. 1008, 104 S. Ct. 1003, 79 L. Ed. 2d 235 (1984), certainly when the tenuous nature of Davis' testimony was not followed up by any corroboration, it should have been stricken and the jury instructed to disregard it. It does not take much imagination to understand how such grossly biased comments would be viewed by the jury. We need not know the racial composition of the jury, for nearly all citizens find themselves repelled by such blatantly racist remarks and resentful of the person claimed to have uttered them. Davis' testimony could only have inflamed the jury rather than have enlightened it concerning any real predisposition or specific intent on the part of the defendant himself. Further as we shall note later the error was compounded when the prosecutor sought unsuccessfully to attribute to Ebens a comment which he claimed was made to Willie Davis in 1974 by the person in Jo-Jo's Bar, a comment to the effect that defendant had called Davis a \"black son of a bitch.\" In Davis' direct examination, counsel sought to elicit that Ebens had made this demeaning statement:\nQ. Now, Mr. Davis, didn't this man, Ron, say other things to you?\nA. They was talking about niggers looking for white women and so on and so forth, like that. It didn't bother me because I wasn't looking for that sort of thing. I wasn't interested in that.\nQ. Didn't he say, what is this black son of a bitch doing in the bar?A. They made a lot of remarks. I can't recall all the remarks. They was making remarks when I went out the door.\nQ. Didn't you tell Agent Garrety that he said that specific statement?\nA. I don't know as I told you all that. I don't know what all the remarks they did make, but I do know about the nigger and the white--\nQ. Didn't you tell me, Mr. Davis, that specific statement?\nA. No, sir, I didn't. I didn't have too much to say to you because the reason I didn't was when you all came [to] my door I didn't know who you was. One of my neighbors was in front of you and when the doorbell rang I went to the door. I don't know whether it was you or the other gentleman, says he was first. My neighbor asked me for a broom.\nProper examination of a hostile witness (assuming Davis was hostile) based upon a prior inconsistent statement, is to produce the statement for the witness' examination for the purposes of refreshing his memory. Use of cross-examination had the improper effect of implying to the jury not only that the witness made the statement in question but that the government had proof to that effect. This is particularly dangerous when the material so implied is inflammatory. Even had the statement been introduced to impeach the credibility of Davis, it would not in any event have been admissible as substantive proof that Ebens uttered the statement. United States v. Lester, 491 F.2d 680 (6th Cir. 1974); Fed.R.Evid. 801(d) (1). While the trial court here gave a precautionary instruction to the jury it was only to the effect that \"the testimony of Mr. Davis insofar as it attributes certain statements to Mr. Ebens and certain conduct to Mr. Ebens is received here only as evidence directed at Mr. Ebens and may not be against co-defendant Nitz.\" The precaution did not limit the purported out-of-court statement to impeachment only but instead concentrated its inflammatory effect upon Ebens. The prejudice is further compounded by the closing argument of government attorney Theodore Merritt:\nYou remember, he was subjected to at least one other episode that that racial animal unleashed. Remember the testimony of Willie Davis? Well Mr. Davis testified that he knew Ronald Ebens, that he owned a bar right behind his house in 1976. But Mr. Davis said he went into that bar two times even though it was right behind his house. Well I think you know the reason why. In 1974, he told you that a man named Ron, who looked like Ronald Ebens, came into a different bar where Willie Davis was having a drink and started calling him a nigger and a black son of a bitch, and accusing him of chasing white women. And Willie Davis told you that he didn't want to cause any trouble so he left the bar. But Ron and his friend followed him to the door, and only when Willie Davis grabbed a tool from his truck, did they go back inside. Does that sound like a familiar scenario? You heard Willie Davis testify that the FBI interviewed him three times, once in my firm, and that we wanted him to be a witness for the government. And you also heard him testify that after he was visited by the defense investigators that weekend before he was going to testify, that they waived [sic] his police record in front of him and they said that they had spoken to Ronald's friends, they knew nothing about this. Well, Willie Davis was a lot more reluctant to positively ID Ronald Ebens. But you know why Willie Davis lost his memory about that.\nFinally, to compound the prejudice to Ebens further, the trial court rejected an offer of proof by defense counsel that during the two years when Ebens had operated a bar of his own, he had served both blacks and whites and had neither harassed, intimidated nor otherwise bothered minority persons who used his place of accommodation.\nNormally this might be considered as having at best a peripheral relevance to rebut the inference made by government attorneys from the fact that Davis, because of Ebens' hostility to blacks, had entered Ron's Bar only twice during the years he owned it although it was located very close to Davis' home. Moreover, the government is correct that Ebens himself was permitted to testify in his own behalf that while he owned his own bar, Ron's Place, he served people of all races. He also called Hattie Sepak, the owner of Jo-Jo's, who testified that she could not recall any racial incidents occurring there. His effort to call two other witnesses, regular customers at Ron's Place, to testify as to the absence of refusal of service and racial incidents while Ebens owned the bar, was rejected by the trial judge on the basis that evidence of noncriminal conduct to negate the inference of criminal conduct is generally irrelevant. See United States v. Grimm, 568 F.2d 1136, 1138 (5th Cir. 1978). While the trial court indicated that it would have permitted him to present evidence of prior acts as character evidence, the defendant maintained he did not intend to employ Fed.R.Evid. 405(a) which thereby put his general character in issue, but instead believed that he was entitled to corroborate his own testimony in view of the most damaging inferences made through the questioning of Davis. The government claims that Ebens has not shown any case law as authority that dissimilar acts are admissible on behalf of the defense under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) to rebut like testimony of similar acts.\nWhile we would normally not fault the trial judge's exercise of discretion in excluding such testimony, permitting a similar latitude in the defense that was granted the prosecution might at least have helped to dissipate the highly prejudicial impact upon the jury of the inadmissible evidence and to preserve the general fairness of the trial.\nEbens also asserts that he was prejudiced by the trial court's improper exclusion as hearsay of the proofs he offered of prior inconsistent statements of government witnesses Jimmy Perry and police officer Michael Gardenhire. It was Perry's testimony at trial that he had been picked up by Ebens and Nitz after they left the Fancy Pants and had been brought along to help locate Chin and Choi. Perry further testified that one of them had offered him $20 to help them find and catch \"a Chinese guy.\" In cross-examination Ebens' counsel tried to discredit Perry's statement concerning the offer of $20 by showing that Perry himself was suspect and that his testimony concerning the $20 offer was not originally part of his story. When Perry, Ebens and Nitz reached McDonald's, Perry saw Highland Park police officers Gardenhire and Roberts who were at the time acting as private security officers for the McDonald's restaurant. Perry appears originally to have denied to the officers that he had been with Ebens and Nitz but then admitted that he was in their company but was assisting them to get Nitz to the hospital. Statements given initially did not include the offer of $20, or so it was claimed. Ebens asserts that he was unduly restricted in his cross-examination of the officer concerning the inconsistent statements.\nSimilarly officer Gardenhire, who was present at the scene and testified in great detail as to the onslaught itself outside of McDonald's and on Woodward Avenue, was cross-examined very closely concerning prior statements he had made about the exact manner in which Ebens had assaulted Chin and particularly whether he had been trying to hit Chin on the head or elsewhere on the body. Cross-examination did bring out that Gardenhire admitted that he may have made somewhat different statements earlier but Gardenhire denied that he had made any statement to a television newsreporter that he was dissatisfied with the outcome of the state court prosecution. This question was undoubtedly aimed at showing some bias on Gardenhire's part which would have colored his recollection of the ferocity and particulars of the assault with the bat. When counsel sought to introduce video tape recordings showing Gardenhire's statements on television indicating such dissatisfaction, he was precluded, again on the basis that the evidence was hearsay. If the defense is correct, the video tape would have been admissible, if properly preserved, as bearing upon credibility of the witness. At the same time, we must observe, particularly with respect to the endeavor to introduce Perry's out-of-court statement, that Perry himself quite readily acknowledged that he had not at first mentioned the $20 offer to the police. Similarly with respect to officer Gardenhire, the trial court's exclusion of his testimony would not of itself be cause for reversal especially since it appears to have had some but not great relevance. The severity of the attack seems to be unquestioned although in a close case it could bear upon the question of the intent with which Ebens attacked Chin.\nThe defendant next claims that the trial was interspersed with incidents of prosecutorial misconduct mandating reversal. The government defends the conduct of its prosecutor and makes the point that the defense, having failed to object contemporaneously, may not do so now.\nThe best starting point for an evaluation of the prosecutorial misconduct claims here, is a repair to the recently decided United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 105 S. Ct. 1038, 84 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1985). Specifically in issue in Young was the extent to which it is necessary to make timely objections to the prosecutorial conduct deemed improper in order to preserve them for potential reversal on appellate review. While the effect of Young was to reinstate a jury verdict of guilty upon a finding that certain statements, although improper, did not amount to plain error, any government attorney, reading the opinion carefully, can have no doubt whatever of the Supreme Court's continued dedication to its historic insistence that prosecutors representing the United States in criminal prosecutions should refrain from improper conduct calculated to produce a wrongful conviction. See Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 55 S. Ct. 629, 79 L. Ed. 1314 (1935).\nWe need not determine whether the instances of misconduct complained of here, which we believe are far more egregious than those examined in Young, would have brought about reversal on a plain error basis since the conviction must in all events be reversed. Most of the complaints of misconduct, however, are directed to the closing argument of government counsel and, as the government points out, most occurred without specific objection by the defense.\nAs to the failure to object during the course of the government's closing arguments, Chief Justice Burger, with great wisdom we think, observed what has been universally recognized by practitioners, that \"interruptions of arguments, either by an opposing counsel or the presiding judge, are matters to be approached cautiously.\" Young, 105 S. Ct. at 1046. The reason obviously is that such interference with counsel's right to address a jury is often resented by both the court and the jury and even where justified, produces the adverse effect of emphasizing the objectionable matter. However, Chief Justice Burger did follow the above quotation with the comment that \" [a]t the very least, a bench conference might have been convened out of the hearing of the jury once defense counsel closed, and an appropriate instruction given.\" Id. Because the present case must be retried, however, we deem it necessary to register most strongly our disapproval of the inflammatory language employed by government counsel. United States v. Young makes it plain that the object of a fair trial is for counsel for both the government and defense to confine themselves within the bounds of professional ethics in presenting their arguments to the jury. The failure of one side to observe the rule does not confer on opposite counsel the license to \"right the scale\" by engaging in equally inappropriate conduct. In this respect Chief Justice Burger repeatedly calls attention to the obligation of the court on its own motion and on its own initiative to assure that neither the defense nor government counsel transcends the bounds of ethics and lawyer-like propriety.\nIt is clear that counsel on both sides of the table share a duty to confine arguments to the jury within proper bounds. Just as the conduct of prosecutors is circumscribed, \" [t]he interests of society in the preservation of courtroom control by the judges are no more to be frustrated through unchecked improprieties by defenders.\" Defense counsel, like the prosecutor, must refrain from interjecting personal beliefs into the presentation of his case. Defense counsel, like his adversary, must not be permitted to make unfounded and inflammatory attacks on the opposing advocate....\n* * *\n* * *\nWe emphasize that the trial judge has the responsibility to maintain decorum in keeping with the nature of the proceedings; \"the judge is not a mere moderator, but is the governor of the trial for the purpose of assuring its proper conduct.\" Quercia v. United States, 289 U.S. 466, 469, 53 S. Ct. 698, 699, 77 L. Ed. 1321 (1933). The judge \"must meet situations as they arise and [be able] to cope with ... the contingencies inherent in the adversary process.\" Geders v. United States, supra, 425 U.S. [80,] 86, 96 S. Ct. [1330,] 1334, 47 L. Ed. 2d 592. Of course, \"hard blows\" cannot be avoided in criminal trials; both the prosecutor and defense counsel must be kept within appropriate bounds.\nId., 105 S. Ct. at 1043-44. (Most citations omitted.) (Footnote omitted.)\nUnited States v. Young makes repeated references, with approval, to the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice (2d ed. 1980). Rather than repeat them once more here, we refer trial counsel and the court to footnotes 5, 6, and 7 at page 1043 of the Young opinion. We can think of no better expression of the ethical principles which should guide an attorney in his representation of the United States.\nAs Young makes clear,\n[t]he plain error doctrine of Federal Rule Criminal Procedure 52(b) tempers the blow of a rigid application of the contemporaneous objection requirement. The Rule authorizes the Courts of Appeals to correct only \"particularly egregious errors,\" United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 163, 102 S. Ct. 1584, 1592, 71 L. Ed. 2d 816 (1982), those errors that \"seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" United States v. Atkinson, 297 U.S. [157,] 160, 56 S. Ct. [391,] 392, 80 L. Ed. 555 (1936).\nId., 105 S. Ct. at 1046-47. (Footnote omitted.)\nThe principal message of Young is that in reviewing prosecutorial misconduct for plain error, it is necessary that the error be measured not within the narrow confines of the argument but against the entire record. \"It is simply not possible for an appellate court to assess the seriousness of the claimed error by any other means.\" Young, 105 S. Ct. at 1047. Accordingly, we have carefully reviewed the entire record and against the background of all of the evidence. It must be remembered at the outset that the case itself arose in an atmosphere of extraordinary publicity. The video tapes contained as part of the special record made with respect to the motion for a change of venue, demonstrate the deep sense of public outrage especially after it was perceived that the Chin incident was motivated by racial bias. Nearly every news telecast showed the pathetic figure of Chin's weeping mother making pleas for justice. There are countless photographs of marches and demonstrations in front of both the county office buildings and the federal office buildings in Detroit, some, according to the accounts, attracting over 700 persons carrying large placards. The city council of Detroit was shown awarding a memorial plaque to Chin's mother in affirmation of its dedication to a bias-free administration of justice. The mayor of Highland Park was quoted as critical of the state's investigation. There were many videotaped news recordings showing Lisa Chan and reporting particularly the claim made by her committee that the state trial judge had been deprived of essential evidence in sentencing Ebens, evidence which if known would have induced him to impose a heavier sentence.\nEvery stage of the proceeding was followed with great care by the media. It was even noted that the incident was prominently featured in the press as far away as San Francisco and Hong Kong. Almost nothing was said which would have been derogatory concerning Chin or which would have carried the defendant's own version of the events leading up to the ultimate tragic climax. Every element of the population was queried in the news media concerning its reaction; that reaction was almost without exception condemnatory of Ebens. There were videocasts showing purported auto workers or others in Detroit paying or making donations for the privileges of attacking Japanese-made automobiles with sledgehammers as showing some of the uncontrolled spleen directed at the competition from Japanese imports.\nWe mention these elements not because we conceive that there can be any justification whatever for the assault which took place nor because the government prosecutor was chargeable with any part of the massive publicity. Likewise we recognize fully that this was a public event and a matter of great and crucial importance to the Detroit metropolitan area. We do not remotely suggest that there should be any inhibitions on the First Amendment rights of the media to report matters of such great public importance. We mention these circumstances, however, only to show that a heightened sensitivity on the part of the prosecutor was necessary if the values of a fair trial under such explosive circumstances were to be preserved. Of the jurors, only three professed no knowledge of the incident at all. The others had all been exposed to one extent or another to the massive publicity which continued right up to and through the trial itself. Plainly, it seems to us, the government attorneys were under a very special burden of responsibility to make sure that their own conduct did not contribute to what was already a very great risk that the verdict would be the product not of the evidence but of public dissatisfaction with the earlier state court sentence.\nThe closing arguments of the government counsel began as a model of aggressive yet entirely fair advocacy. His review of the evidence was careful and made telling use of inconsistencies in the stories and arguments of the defense. It was a classic example of the hard but fair blows recognized in Berger. As he progressed, however, he took advantage of the rulings of the trial court to make impermissible inferences from evidence which ought either to have been kept out of the trial or, if admitted, to have been held to a limited use.\nThus while we have already held that it was error to have excluded the Chan tapes, had those tapes been played they would have indicated an effort on the part of Lisa Chan to orchestrate the testimony of the witnesses who attended the meeting so that they would appear to be sufficiently diverse in character as not to sound rehearsed and yet would include all the essential elements to prove a racial bias. The prosecutor then took advantage of the excluded testimony by making the following comment which might otherwise be entirely proper:\nNow ladies and gentlemen, this probably doesn't need to be said; but just because these witnesses heard different things at different times doesn't mean they contradict each other. Naturally, when the music was loud and their perspectives were different, when they were paying different degrees of attention, they wouldn't hear or recall the exact same things. No, they don't contradict each other. You should worry if they came in here and said, yes, I heard the exact same thing. Now they corroborate each other, because the one thing that they all heard was that Vincent Chin was never aggressive or hostile....\nHad the jurors been permitted to hear the tapes of Lisa Chan's joint witness interview of May 17,4 they would have had at least a means to determine whether the witnesses' testimony was in fact correct or the extent to which it was coached. Excerpts from that interview are appended hereto as appendix A and show the nature of the coaching which took place.\nGovernment attorney Mr. Merritt then proceeded with a very strong point bearing on the existence of Ebens' guilt under the federal act: the evidence that Ebens and Nitz appeared to have singled out for pursuit only the Orientals, Vincent Chin and Jimmy Choi, and to have left their white companions largely undisturbed. This evidence of Ebens' bias was further fortified by emphasis on the testimony that Jimmy Perry was offered $20 to, as Mr. Merritt characterized, \"help catch those Chinese guys.\" Thus the $20 offer and the reference to Chinese guys was a very vital part of the government's attempt to show express bias against Orientals and that there was calculation which precluded any excuse of spontaneous anger centering on a fight over the dancing girls at the bar. We do not fault the prosecutor for forcefully emphasizing this evidence once it had been allowed in by the trial court. At the same time it can be seen that the successful efforts to exclude evidence concerning Jimmy Perry's initial failure to mention to the police officer anything about the $20 and the request to find \"the Chinese guy\" had to have at least an important bearing on the credibility of Perry's testimony. The error in restricting the cross-examination is apparent.\nUp to this point, therefore, we conclude that the prosecutor had stricken harsh blows but fair ones, especially in light of the evidence which was admitted. We point up the foregoing arguments only as showing the prejudicial effect of the admission of the evidence or the limitation on cross-examination and not on the conduct of the prosecutor himself. However when Mr. Merritt came to discussing the Willie Davis incident his argument went far beyond what we believe to be the permissible inferences of the proof submitted concerning that incident. After pointing to some of the evidence from which the inference of identity could be made, he argued strongly that Ronald Ebens came into the bar that night where Willie Davis was having a drink and \"started calling him a nigger and a black son of a bitch\" and accusing him of chasing white women. He then argued very forcefully that Davis had been intimidated from testifying by improper defense pressures when they sought to interview him:\nYou heard Willie Davis testify that the FBI interviewed him three times, once in my firm, and that we wanted him to be a witness for the government. And you also heard him testify that after he was visited by the defense investigator that weekend before he was going to testify, that they waived [sic] his police record in front of him, and they said they had spoken to Ronald's friends, they knew nothing about this. Well, Willie Davis was a lot more reluctant to positively ID Ronald Ebens. But you know why Willie Davis lost his memory about that.\nThe prosecutor thus took full advantage of the fact that the trial court had failed to caution the jury about the out-of-court statements inferentially attributed through government questioning to Willie Davis. The impermissible hearsay was thus elevated to substantive proof without restriction and the purported reason for using it was only peripheral at best.\nThe government counsel also took unfair advantage, in our view, of the restrictions upon the use of the transcripts of the Lisa Chan interviews by inferring that the defense had endeavored to use only selected portions of the tapes so as to keep their impact from the jury. Thus he argued [t]he defense selected lines from these voluminous transcripts, lines where they may have said something different on occasion. But how many times were those lines taken out of context, when they were trying to impeach Bob Sirosky and Jimmy Choi, where they left out part of the proceedings, where there were answers on the tape, and they said there was an interruption on the tape? How many of these inconsistencies are really about minor things like whether or not he said you son of a bitch or mother fucker.\nThe government also chided the defense for not putting in the entire tapes while knowing it had been prevented from doing so by the court's adverse ruling on admissibility.\nThe injection of the Davis incident had the effect of suggesting a negative attitude toward blacks on Ebens' part. In addition the prosecutor pointed out that one of the witnesses who saw Vincent Chin was herself black and later testified that she saw the defendant with a baseball bat. The obvious strategy was continued in arguments which the prosecutor then made that \"this was more than some barroom fight. This was violent hatred turned lose [sic]. This was years of pent-up racial hostilities and rage unleashed. This was a modern-day lynching, but there was a bat instead of a rope.\"\nThe government prosecutor became more strident in his remarks after the defense had finished its summation. In a series of comments on the evidence, some of it disputed, the prosecutor preceded each comment with the term \"We know,\" such as \"We know that Ebens and Nitz went after Jimmy Choi and not his white counterparts ... that Ebens said that he would have gotten [Choi] too if they hadn't stopped him ... that they offered Jimmy Perry $20 to get those Chinese guys.\" He then went on to observe that \"We're not Niggers; we're not Kikes, we're not Polaks, we're Americans. And as Americans, we must condemn this type of racial violence.\" He then closes by saying, \"Now these defendants have had a fair trial and now it's up to you to do your duty, to hold them responsible for their actions.\"\nThe employment by the prosecutor of comments which represent his \"personal impression\" are, as pointed out by Chief Justice Burger in United States v. Young, directly violative of the American Bar Association's standards for criminal justice that \" [i]t is unprofessional conduct for a lawyer to express a personal belief or opinion in his client's innocence or personal belief or opinion in the truth or falsity of any testimony or evidence, or to attribute the crime to another person unless such an inference is warranted by the evidence.\" Id. 105 S. Ct. at 1043 n. 7 (quoting ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 4-7.8(b)).\nWith respect to personal impressions, Chief Justice Burger observed in Young, \" [n]otwithstanding the defense counsel's breach of ethical standards [engaging in similar conduct] the prosecutor's statement of his belief that the evidence showed Apco had been defrauded should not have been made; it was an improper expression of personal opinion and was not necessary to answer defense counsel's improper assertion that no one on the prosecution team believed respondent intended to defraud Apco.\" Id. at 1048. Also while recognizing that such argument may not always be reversible, Chief Justice Burger specifically held that \" [t]he prosecutor was also in error to try to exhort the jury to 'do its job'; that kind of pressure, whether by the prosecutor or defense counsel, has no place in the administration of criminal justice.\" Id. Thus, it appears that the prosecutor's comments again violated the ethical standards as reaffirmed in Young and defined by the American Bar Association. ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, at 3-5.8(c) and 4-7.8(c).\nTwo other complaints by appellant merit further comment.\nOne of the defense witnesses was a nude dancer at the club, Angela Rudolph, whose stage name was Starlene. It was Starlene's testimony that she was the subject of derisive remarks made by Chin, remarks which triggered Ebens into the quarrel.\nDuring its case-in-chief government counsel produced testimony from Sharon Fleming, a dancer at the Fancy Pants Lounge, that Ebens had engaged in an act of oral sex with Starlene. Both Ebens and Starlene flatly denied the charge and it was otherwise uncorroborated. Because Starlene had testified favorably to Ebens' theory of defense, the government attorney on rebuttal argument attacked her credibility and observed, \"Ms. Starlene is not known for her truthfulness among the circle that she travels in, and the law enforcement agency, her friends and her co-workers. And ladies and gentlemen, her defensive denial that she would never let anyone touch her, let alone have oral sex with her, well, that shows you how much stock she puts in telling the truth here, under oath.\"\nWe recognize that the sociological standards of those who frequent or entertain at places such as the Fancy Pants Lounge are likely to be substantially foreign to the experiences of most jurors and that what occurs in such places is almost certain to offend some. We think that, unless absolutely required by the needs of the case, the government erred in initiating testimony concerning this conduct. Evidently it was determined to destroy the credibility of the witness by showing that she and the defendant had engaged in an act of oral sex. Such evidence is so likely to offend the normal sensibilities of the average juror as to leave us in serious question whether it should not have been immediately the subject of sua sponte correction by the trial judge. Arguably there may have been some relevance to the testimony, such as showing that Starlene and Ebens enjoyed a special relationship and that therefore her testimony might favor him. And it is also true that broad latitude concerning the circumstances in which a crime occurs, must necessarily be allowed, even though it brings in the bizarre, the unpleasant, and the distasteful. Cf. United States v. Brady, 595 F.2d 359 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 862, 100 S. Ct. 129, 62 L. Ed. 2d 84 (1979). We think, however, that injection of such evidence in this case was highly objectionable as tending to demean the witness and also as tending to depict the defendant in a depraved light before the jury, and thus to distract the jury from its very real task of determining whether Ebens acted with the requisite specific intent under the statute.\nNumerous other claims of error are made, and we have reviewed them all. Without endeavoring to comment expressly on each, we do conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding a letter written by United States Attorney Leonard Gilman on July 6, 1983, explaining his personal opinion that there was insufficient evidence to support the government's prosecution in this case. This is classic hearsay, was totally irrelevant to the issues before the jury, and was properly excluded. We likewise find no merit in the claim that defendant was improperly held twice in jeopardy for the same offense. It is firmly established under the dual sovereignty doctrine that \"an act denounced as a crime by both national and state sovereignties is an offense against the peace and dignity of both, and may be punished by each.\" United States v. Lanza, 260 U.S. 377, 382, 43 S. Ct. 141, 142, 67 L. Ed. 314 (1922). In any event the federal civil rights offense requires proof of facts substantially different from manslaughter, Blockberger v. United States, 284 U.S. 299, 52 S. Ct. 180, 76 L. Ed. 306 (1932), so there is no support for the proposition that double jeopardy was implicated here in any way.\nREVERSED and REMANDED for a new trial.\nAPPENDIX A\nExcerpts from joint witness interview of May 17, 1983:\n\"Liza [sic] Chan: The purpose of this meeting tonight is so we can help each other remember exactly what happened, how it happened, when it happened and all the minor details. We were just going over--I was talking with Eddie Hollis this afternoon, the parking lot attendant, the black guy, I don't know when he came in. I think--but according to his version of the facts, it's quite different from what I have so far understood them to be. So, I would center on my facts on what you, three of you, say they are and somehow try to either fit all the facts around these, or if they don't fit, then I have to watch out, you know, there's something else, somebody's saying something else.\"\n* * *\n* * *\n\"Liza [sic] Chan: We will agree this is the story, this is it. When it's a federal prosecution, h'm, we're all going to have to be agreeing on this is what happened. Now, if you don't agree, like I explained to them earlier, you definitely remembered certain things happened, say, it's a black car and you definitely remembered it's a white car and we kind of (inaudible), okay, other than that, let's all have it sort of down, have it down pat, is it five minutes or is it ten minutes. Is it more like eight minutes, let's all agree. Otherwise, you all look funny on the stand. You all supposedly were there. But one says two minutes, the other says eight and that's what robbed me before.\"\n* * *\n* * *\n\"Gary Koivu: Is there any harm in getting too accurate, because they could say, well, you all rehersed [sic] this, like if you're in court and we all have exactly the same times.\n\"Liza [sic] Chan: As long as you're within, you know, you could say 8:10, you could say 8:20, I mean, that doesn't matter.\n\"Gary Koivu: Mm hmm. Right, but as long as they have example.\n\"Liza [sic] Chan: Right. But as far as the crucial facts, the crucial ones are not conflicting. I'll give you an example. Like what you've people have been telling me and then what Eddie Hollis told me. Totally make me completely confused. That is going to be raising a question in the jury's mind: well, who's telling the truth? Or what actually happened. Maybe nobody's to be believed. Now, I don't mean exactly everybody agreed okay, everbody [sic] agree at 6:30 right on the dot.\n\"Robert Siroskey [sic]: Mm hmm.\n\"Liza [sic] Chan: This could have a little bit of leeway.\n\"Robert Siroskey [sic]: Okay.\n\"Liza [sic] Chan: Okay. H'm, but I mean, you know, you can't say that we stayed at Fancy Pants for two hours and then another person says we stayed at Fancy Pants for half an hour. I mean that's a big discrepancy there.\n\"Robert Siroskey [sic]: Right.\"\n* * *\n* * *\n\"Liza [sic] Chan: H'm, also, you don't have to volunteer any information. Well, Jerry Craig [FBI agent] may be slightly different because we do want to facilitate in terms of investigation. The question is not whether it is a murder or justifiable, the question is whether there was any reason that they--Vincent was bothered at all, let alone killed, because of his race, bothered from enjoying the services and entertainment because of his race. So, right now, it's not whether there's sufficient cause, who [inaudible] whether--it's still essential that you know, the essential point is that Vincent didn't fight back, or, you know, being chased, just fled. And those are still essential. We're not going to say, well, now, since that's the case, we don't have to say anything good for Vincent, just the truth. If he's good, he's good; if he's bad, he's bad. If he's semi-bad, he's semi-bad. Don't volunteer information. If the guy didn't ask you, or whoever, didn't ask you, did they have any words exchanged when Ebens and Nitz walked out? You don't have to say it. They say, what happened next? Ebens and Nitz were escorted out. Okay. And then went to the car and they took out a baseball bat. Unless someone says did anybody say anything, or did anything happen in between, you don't have to volunteer. You don't have to unless you're asked.\"\n* * *\n* * *\"Liza [sic] Chan: Then he started out of the chair?\n\"Gary Koivu: Yeah.\n\"Jimmy Choi: He ran over.\n\"Gary Koivu: Yeah.\n\"Liza [sic] Chan: So, that's--you remember\n\"Robert Siroskey [sic]: That's why I remember just before he got up, he says: don't call me a motherfucker. I remember that.\n\"Liza [sic] Chan: Okay. We all remember our different lines, okay.

Umm, then what happened? Go ahead.\"\n* * *\n* * *\nLisa Chan Maybe you heard that before: don't call me a fucker.\nRobert Sirosky See, I have to go with what he said.\nLisa Chan Wait a minute now. That might make sense. Little fuckers, big fuckers, we're all fuckers.\nRobert Sirosky Mm hmm.\nLisa Chan Then VINCENT could have said: don't call me a fucker. Could be. I'm just saying--\nGary Koivu No, I'm just saying what I--like I said, I'm not saying I saw everything, but I did see--\nLisa Chan But what you did hear or did hear, was after the words: don't call me a fucker, I'm not a fucker.\nGary Koivu Mm hmm.\nLisa Chan So, but you did remember hearing something about little fuckers and big fuckers, we're all fuckers.\nJimmy Choi Mm hmm.\nGary Koivu Yeah.\nLisa Chan And you, same thing?\nRobert Sirosky Yes. I remember hearing something to the effect that--\nLisa Chan Coming from EBENS or NITZ. Coming from EBENS or NITZ?\nRobert Sirosky Who's EBENS? Who's NITZ? I don't--\nGary Koivu EBENS was the big guy.\nLisa Chan Is it the big guy?\nGary Koivu The older guy.\nRobert Sirosky The older guy.\nLisa Chan Okay.\nJimmy Choi The blond haired guy.\nLisa Chan Okay. Let's presume that he said--let's presume that he said chink, let's presume you heard something about foreign cars, let's presume also that you--I'll let the jury decide who said what first, but let's also presume that you heard EBENS saying big fuckers, little fuckers, we're all fuckers. Both of you heard that.\nRobert Sirosky Right.\nLisa Chan Then maybe at that point VINCENT said don't call me a fucker, I'm not a fucker.\nGary Koivu Was made me presume that VINCENT said something to--maybe VINCENT, perhaps, called him a fucker. Why would he all of a sudden say big fuckers, little fuckers, we're all fuckers? I was under the impression that VINCENT wasn't saying anything to this guy until--\nLisa Chan Mm hmm, mm hmm.\nGary Koivu --he said, whatever he said, and VINCENT said, don't call me a fucker, I'm not a fucker.\nLisa Chan Well, it could be afterwards, too. Don't call me a fucker, I'm not a fucker. EBENS could have said big fuckers, little fuckers, we're all fuckers. No?\nGary Koivu I sure would have seen it. I was sitting right next to VINCENT--\nLisa Chan That didn't blow over--\nGary Koivu--and looking right at EBENS.\nLisa Chan Well, any suggestions? We're all sure what we heard? That's okay, I mean, that's fine, too. I just--\nRobert Sirosky I'm positive--\nLisa Chan --while I have all three of youRobert Sirosky I'm positive what I heard after VINCENT said that.\nGary Koivu Yeah, what VINCENT said after that.\nLisa Chan Okay. We rely on you whatever was said afterward.\nGary Koivu Before that VINCENT said I'm not a fucker--\nLisa Chan Right.\nGary Koivu I'm out of it, you know, these two.\nLisa Chan You weren't paying attention.\nGary Koivu See what they heard.\nLisa Chan At some point you heard chink definitely, for sure.\nRobert Sirosky Right, right.\nLisa Chan Could it be into the fight?\nRobert Sirosky Into the fight? No.\nRobert Sirosky We're all sitting--\nLisa Chan Sitting.\nRobert Sirosky Yes.\nLisa Chan Still things are going fine. The first thing you heard was something about chink.\nRobert Sirosky Mm hmm.\nLisa Chan Fighting and all other words came later?\nRobert Sirosky Mm hmm.\nLisa Chan You heard something about foreign cars; that's also the same situation, not in the middle of the fight or anything, or in the middle of an exchange?\nRobert Sirosky There's a lot of destractions [sic], too, because the music is loud--\nJimmy Choi The people--\nRobert Sirosky --The people\nJimmy Choi --were around, girl dancing--\nRobert Sirosky --girls dancing.\nJimmy Choi --and then--he and I were talking.\nLisa Chan All right, then, the next thing. We've got all these lines.\nGary Koivu I told you I tapped VINCENT on the arm saying forget it, you know,--\nLisa Chan Okay.\nGary Koivu --I may have said, it's not important.\nLisa Chan Right. And?\nGary Koivu And when EBENS said, you know, I just don't know if you're a big fucker, little fucker--\nLisa Chan Makes sense.\nGary Koivu --and that's when VINCE--\nLisa Chan Makes sense, makes sense.

      "text": "The cap on cars from Japan, the rescue of Detroit, and the birth of an industry in the American South\nRecommended Reading\nExecutive Summary\nIn 1980, Japanese automakers were trouncing Detroit\u2019s \u201cBig Three\u201d in the American car market. After decades of intensive state support, Japanese firms had developed the world\u2019s most efficient production processes and made the highest-quality cars. Without the time and resources to retool, American automakers risked bankruptcy and mass layoffs. President Ronald Reagan negotiated a quota on Japanese imports that stemmed competition for four years, bought Detroit time to retool, and spurred massive foreign investment in a new manufacturing base in the South that created hundreds of thousands of American jobs.\nKey Lessons\nInternational economic competition defies free-market dogma. According to market fundamentalists, free markets are supposed to create incentives and competitive pressures that spur productivity and innovation. Active efforts by policymakers are supposed to backfire.\nThe Japanese auto industry, insulated from foreign competition and subsidized by the state, was not a catastrophic failure, but a global leader in quality and innovation. America\u2019s open market did not foster more resilient, productive, or innovative firms; it exposed them to near-fatal import competition. Only when American policymakers stepped in did the domestic manufacturing base improve and grow.\nBounded markets channel investment and competition in the national interest. Blunt constraints that set market boundaries, while encouraging competition therein, help to ensure that capitalism\u2019s power is serving the national interest. Rather than fostering sclerosis and cronyism, the import quota encouraged innovation, spurred investment, and boosted long-term production.\nTrade barriers create new incentives for investment. Cars made in America were exempt from the import quota, which led Japanese automakers to invest in U.S.-based assembly facilities.\nProduction is a function of past policy and investment choices. Once assembly moved onshore, Japanese firms had incentives to onshore the rest of their value chain\u2014production, research, and design\u2014and they\u2019ve chosen to continue their American investments long after the import quota was lifted.\nKey Facts\nWithin a decade, the import quota generated:\n- $25+ billion in foreign capital investment (2022 dollars)\n- 8 new auto assembly plants\n- 300+ new production facilities\n- 100,000+ new American jobs\nToday, Honda and Toyota have among the highest domestic content of cars sold in America.\nBackground\nAfter four decades of aggressive public support from its Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)\u2014direct subsidies, tax breaks, cheap loans, and information-sharing\u2014Japan had built an automotive juggernaut by the 1970s with the world\u2019s most efficient production processes and its highest-quality cars.1Robert E. Cole and Taizo Yakushiji, \u201cThe American and Japanese Auto Industries in Transition: Report of the Joint U.S.-Japan Automotive Study,\u201d University of Michigan Center for Japanese Studies (1984), 37. Its top automaker, Toyota, had perfected its management of material to the point that its inventory costs were only a tenth of General Motors\u2019.2Joseph M. Callahan, \u201cThe Metamorphosis of an Industry,\u201d Automotive Industries (June 1983), 16. American automotive engineers awarded many more top product-quality honors to Japanese automakers than to American ones.3Ronald Schiller, \u201cCan America Win the Car War?\u201d Reader\u2019s Digest (January 6, 1981), 72. Over the decade, the Japanese industry improved its productivity at 4.3% annually\u2014three times the American rate of progress.\nWhereas American firms competed in a free and open market, Japan had insulated its automakers from foreign competition. On top of the aggressive government support it provided to its own producers, high tariffs kept imports uncompetitive, while onerous standards made it virtually impossible for foreign firms to build operations in Japan.4Stephen D. Cohen, \u201cThe Route to Japan\u2019s Voluntary Export Restraints on Automobiles: An Analysis of the U.S. Government\u2019s Decision-Making Process in 1981,\u201d Working Paper No. 20. American tolerance for such an imbalanced arrangement was a feature of Cold War-era trade policy and had long been a source of frustration for American auto executives.5Carl H. Tong and Allen L. Bures, \u201cThe Voluntary Export Restraint (VER) Agreement with Japan on Automobiles in the 1980s,\u201d Essays in Economic and Business History (2003), 58.\nFrom 1970 to 1976, Japanese cars tripled their sales volume in the United States to more than 1 million units and 8% market share.6American Compass analysis of data from Automotive News and Steven Berry et al., \u201cVoluntary Export Restraints on Automobiles: Evaluating a Trade Policy,\u201d The American Economic Review (June 1999). Then came the decade\u2019s second oil crisis. In the wake of the Iranian Revolution in Spring 1979, as oil prices more than doubled, American consumers lost their taste for American-made \u201cgas guzzlers\u201d and switched en masse to smaller, more fuel-efficient cars.7Carl H. Tong and Allen L. Bures, \u201cThe Voluntary Export Restraint (VER) Agreement with Japan on Automobiles in the 1980s,\u201d Essays in Economic and Business History (2003), 53. In 1980, nearly two out of every three new automobiles sold were small or compact cars, up from fewer than half in 1978.8Stephen D. Cohen, \u201cThe Route to Japan\u2019s Voluntary Export Restraints on Automobiles: An Analysis of the U.S. Government\u2019s Decision-Making Process in 1981,\u201d Working Paper No. 20.\nSmall, fuel-efficient cars were a Japanese specialty and the American automakers, unable to quickly retool, quickly lost ground. Japanese automakers reached 21% market share in 1980,9American Compass analysis of data from Steven Berry et al., \u201cVoluntary Export Restraints on Automobiles: Evaluating a Trade Policy,\u201d The American Economic Review (June 1999). at which point they were exporting nearly two million cars annually to the U.S.\u2014more than they were selling in their home market.10Douglas R. Nelson, \u201cThe Political Economy of U.S. Automobile Protection,\u201d The Political Economy of American Trade Policy (January 1996), 161. That year, the Big Three American automakers suffered a $6.2 billion loss,11The US. Motor Vehicle and Equipment Industry since 1958, U.S. Department of Commerce (May 1985), 137. after an average of $4.4 billion in annual profits during the previous decade.12Ibid. In the span of two years, Big Three sales had plummeted 30%, to their lowest level since 1961.13Stephen D. Cohen, \u201cThe Route to Japan\u2019s Voluntary Export Restraints on Automobiles: An Analysis of the U.S. Government\u2019s Decision-Making Process in 1981,\u201d Working Paper No. 20. Chrysler was on the verge of bankruptcy,14William Proxmire, \u201cThe Case Against Bailing Out Chrysler,\u201d The New York Times (October 21, 1979). and over 100,000 auto factory workers had been laid off.15Christopher J. Singleton, \u201cAuto industry jobs in the 1980\u2019s: a decade of transition,\u201d Monthly Labor Review (February 1992), 19.\nPolicy Intervention\nBacked by the threat of an outright import quota, President Reagan negotiated a \u201cvoluntary export restraint\u201d (VER) with Japan\u2019s Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). Japan agreed to limit its auto exports to the United States to 1.68 million, the level from 1979, for three years beginning in 1981. It was the economic equivalent of an import quota.\nImpact\nIn the near term, the quota reduced the sales of Japanese cars by 20%16American Compass analysis of data from Automotive News, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the U.S. International Trade Commission. and raised prices for consumers by an average of 8%, costing American consumers an additional $5.1 billion.17American Compass analysis of U.S. International Trade Commission data. Calculated based on the differences between the actual and estimated total volume and average price of Japanese automobiles sold in the U.S. from 1981 to 1984. But within the decade it had prompted nearly three times that much in foreign direct investment18American Compass analysis of U.S. Department of Commerce data. and brought 26,600 new auto-assembly jobs to the American South and Midwest.19Brett C. Smith, \u201cJapanese Automotive Supplier Investment Directory,\u201d University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (October 1991). The investment in assembly plants spurred Japanese automakers to onshore more of their value chains, including component manufacturing and materials, which created 101,700 American jobs by 1991.20Ibid.\nTrade barriers created new market incentives to invest.\nThe quota set no limit on the number of vehicles Japanese automakers could sell in America, only on how many they could export to the country. Cars built in the U.S. were exempt. As a result, the Japanese automakers had new incentives to invest in U.S.-based manufacturing capacity. In 1980, there were no Japanese auto assembly plants in the U.S. Within a decade of Reagan\u2019s action, every major Japanese automaker\u2014Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Isuzu, and Subaru\u2014began assembling cars in America.21Mike Arnholt and Tim Keenan, \u201cForeign invasion: imports, transplants change auto industry forever,\u201d Wards Auto (May 1, 1996).\nReduced imports encouraged innovation and competitiveness.\nMeanwhile, American automakers took advantage of the breathing room afforded by reduced import competition. They improved their capabilities to compete in the newly fuel-conscious consumer market. Car size and weight declined, while fuel efficiency increased. Operations improved to better control quality while also cutting costs.22Robert J. Carbaugh, International Economics (1995), 157. By 1989, American automakers could produce cars with 25% less labor than in 1979, which equated to robust 3% annual productivity growth.23Christopher J. Singleton, \u201cAuto industry jobs in the 1980\u2019s: a decade of transition,\u201d Monthly Labor Review (February 1992), 25.\nNew production better served American workers and the national interest.\nBecause of the quota, Japanese competition no longer posed the threat to American workers that Japanese imports once did. Once assembly moved onshore, Japanese automakers employed American workers and began to onshore the rest of their value chain, including parts production, research, and design. Many Japanese cars became American-made cars, and the share of American-made cars sold in the U.S. held steady.24American Compass analysis of Automotive News data.\nLong after the quota had lifted, Japanese automakers continued to invest in the United States, building production and research facilities in more than 28 states.25Emiko Jozuka, \u201cHow Honda survived a trade war with the US and won over Americans,\u201d CNN (June 26, 2019). Today, Toyotas and Hondas are not only assembled in America, but also consistently rank among the cars with the highest American content.26American Compass analysis of Cars.com data.\nRecommended Reading\nThe American Camry\nWells King and Dan Vaughn, Jr. on how Reagan showed it was possible to wrangle foreign manufacturers to the U.S.\nSearching for Capitalism in the Wreckage of Globalization\nMutual dependence between capital and labor, not mere \u201ceconomic freedom,\u201d is what Adam Smith so ably described.

      "text": "On November 27, 1968, 150 elderly Filipino and Chinese tenants from the Manilatown district of San Francisco began a nine-year-long, anti-eviction campaign against Financial District encroachment. Widespread student and community grass-roots support imprinted this event as a milestone in Asian American and housing advocacy history.\nThe campaign culminated in the deployment of over 400 riot police, mounted patrols, anti-sniper units and !re ladder trucks in a 3:00 AM eviction raid on August 4, 1977. A 3,000-person human barricade was brutally cleared away by authorities before tenants were physically removed from the premises.\nAfter the eviction in 1977 and demolition in 1979, a newly established International Hotel Citizens Advisory Committee (IHCAC), appointed by Mayor Dianne Feinstein and chaired initially by Dr. Rolland Lowe and then Linda Wang, led persistent efforts to ensure that low-income housing would be built on the site.\nThe International Hotel (I-Hotel) was located in a once-thriving Filipino American enclave. Originally consisting of over ten square blocks and located near the edge of San Francisco Chinatown, Manilatown was considered home to many Filipino farmworkers, merchant marines and service workers. During the 1960s, Financial District encroachment steadily shoved the residential Manilatown community into \u201chigher use\u201d development.\nFIRE, TRAGEDY, MOUNTING SUPPORT\nI-Hotel owner Walter Shorenstein, President of Milton Meyer & Company, intended to demolish the building in order to build a multi-level parking lot. In protest, tenants, represented by the United Filipino Associa- tion (UFA), marched to Milton Meyer & Company o ces and succeeded in obtaining a lease agreement to be signed on March 16, 1969. However, in the early morning hours of March 16, a suspicious arson swept through the north wing of the top floor of the I-Hotel, killing three tenants; Pio Rosete, Marcario Salermo and Robert Knau . Milton Meyer & Company backed away from the lease agreement and used the fire as justification for the demolition of an \u201cunsafe\u201d building.\nMounting public opposition forced Shorenstein to sign a three-year lease, slated to end on June 30, 1972. In the meantime, the building went through extensive renovation at the hands of hundreds of student and community volunteers. Abandoned storefronts gave birth to community centers. Burnt-out hotel rooms were rebuilt, plastered and painted by donated labor.\nOccupying I-Hotel storefronts, Asian Community Center, Asian Legal Services, Chinatown Cooperative, Chinatown-North Beach Youth Council, Chinese Progressive Association and Kearny Street Workshop became conduits for the political, social and cultural transformation of the San Francisco Chinatown and Manilatown communities. Everybody\u2019s Bookstore, the first Asian American bookstore in the nation, was established in the I-Hotel. Key participants included student activists from the Third World Liberation Front strikes of San Francisco State College and UC Berkeley. These community centers and groups would eventually expand and nurture a constituent base of support for the I-Hotel struggle.\nOn October 31, 1973, Shorenstein sold the property to a Chinese-Thai liquor baron, Supasit Mahaguna, who held title to the property under the name Four Seas Investment Corporation. The property transfer had the effect of changing the target of the struggle from local big capital to foreign Asian capital.\nNegotiations with Mahaguna for lease extensions proved fruitless, and the California Supreme Court ultimately mandated San Francisco Sheriff Richard Hongisto to evict the tenants. Refusing to enforce the eviction order, Hongisto was jailed for five days in April 1977 for contempt of court. He eventually fulfilled the court order and evicted tenants out of the I-Hotel the following August. In this nine-year period from 1968 to 1977, community support was the key factor for the series of eviction postponements, numerous court stays, and intervention by local politicians.\nThe participation of volunteers and the organization of the tenants created a new level of community solidarity and deepened public opposition to the eviction. Tenants formed and democratically elected the International Hotel Tenants Association (IHTA). It strived daily to meet the general welfare needs of the mostly elderly Filipino and Chinese residents.\nThe eviction on August 4, 1977 at 3:00 AM in the morning was a government action abhorred by many to be the most offensive in San Francisco history. A 3,000-member strong human shield resisted the intrusion of 400 riot police outside the building. Over 100 tenants and supporters barricaded themselves inside the building. This resistance captured widespread local, national and international support and imagination.\nThe support work, prior to and after the eviction, involved mass mobilizations and rallies that made the I-Hotel struggle a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. This movement fostered further activism by younger and older generations in the community, which began to challenge conservative methods of change. New organizations, such as the Chinatown Community Development Center and later, the Manilatown Heritage Foundation, emerged from the disaster of eviction to address the grassroots housing and social needs of the community.\nPOST EVICTION\nAffordable housing on the site would not have occurred if not for the efforts of community members, who maintained constant pressure on San Francisco city government following the tumultuous eviction of tenants. In response to public outcry over the 1979 demolition of the I-Hotel, Mayor Feinstein established the International Hotel Block Development Citizens Advisory Committee (IHCAC) to make recommendations concerning the future of the site. In 1982, at the urging of the IHCAC, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a zoning ordinance that required housing on the I-Hotel location.\nBetween 1983 and 1993, the IHCAC, the City, and the Four Seas owners negotiated a development agreement that was later withdrawn by Four Seas. After this withdrawal, the IHCAC negotiated with other developers but without success. From 1984-2004, the IHCAC continued efforts to raise development funds and in 1993, agreed to a joint development project with St. Mary\u2019s Chinese Schools and Catholic Center, with St. Mary\u2018s developing its school site. In 1993, Chinatown Community Development Center (Chinatown CDC) was selected to be the housing developer.\nWith public support, the IHCAC was able to forestall Four Seas\u2019 commercial development plans and secure the site for housing. The final piece in securing the site was put in place in 1998 when Pan-Magna (successor corporation to Four Seas) finally sold the I-Hotel site to the Catholic Church, through the Archdiocese of San Francisco. Through the negotiation efforts of St. Mary\u2019s, led by Father Daniel McCotter, Pan-Magna owner Supasit Mahaguna finally released ownership and control of the property. This created the basis for joint project use of the location for low- income senior housing and the building of the St. Mary\u2019s Chinese Schools and Catholic Center. In 1994, the US Department of Hous- ing and Urban Development awarded a $8.3 million grant for affordable senior housing to co-sponsors Chinatown CDC and the Kearny Street Housing Corporation (incorporated body of the IHCAC).\nSubsequently, Chinatown CDC secured an increase in the HUD grant to $11.1 million and also initiated a capital campaign raising funds from private individuals, foundations and corporations. The results of this campaign, plus funding from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and the Mayor\u2019s Office of Housing (a significant proportion of which had been reserved for I-Hotel housing by previous administrations through IHCAC efforts over the years), totaled $17 million in additional funding. In 1997, the Manilatown Heritage Foundation incorporated and became active in locating former I-Hotel tenants.\nDue to the organizing efforts of tenants and community organizations, the new I-Hotel opened its doors on August 26, 2005, providing 104 units of low-income housing. The new I-Hotel exists today as a secure, reasonably priced and well-maintained building that serves the needs of low-income elderly tenants.\nThe memory and legacy of the I-Hotel struggle have been carried on by the work of the Manilatown Center that serves the cultural needs of the tenants and the surrounding community. Similar to the social service programs in the original hotel, the new I-Hotel has arranged for the provision of on-site nutrition services by Self Help for the Elderly and health related programs. The construction of St. Mary\u2019s Chinese Schools and Catholic Center is slated to be completed in 2011. After three decades, the I-Hotel site is returned to the community. After three decades, the new I-Hotel is rebuilding a sense of community. The resurrection of the I-Hotel is a testimonial to this community\u2019s resilience and determination.\nIn 2006, the International Hotel Senior Housing, Inc. Board of Directors established the International Hotel History Committee with the charge of memorializing the history of the International Hotel and the community struggle to protect low-income housing. The History Committee worked from 2006 to 2010 to develop a timeline and this brochure. The committee\u2019s work entailed the interviewing of key parties to capture this history from the struggle of tenants against eviction to the re-opening of the International Hotel."

At the time, the American Auto Industry was in a crushing recession and much of the hostility was directed at Japan and Japanese auto imports. Chin was a 27-year-old Chinese American who was celebrating his bachelor\u2019s party in Detroit. On the night of the murder, he was visiting the Fancy Pants strip club with his friends. Ronald Ebens and his stepson Michael Nitz, two white auto workers, began to harass Vincent with racial epithets and a fight broke out.

      "text": "Blog\nRonald Ebens, Vincent Chin\u2019s killer, denies financial windfall, debt to Chin estate in new interview\n\u201cI\u2019m doing fine,\u201d Ronald Ebens told me on Wednesday, a day after the June 23 anniversary of Vincent Chin\u2019s brutal murder, when I asked how he was doing.\nHe was quick to add, \u201cI had a good Father\u2019s Day with my kids.\u201d\nAnd when I asked if he did anything special on Tuesday, the actual day Chin\u2019s life ended, Ebens answered back with a question. \u201cLike what?\u201d\nEbens said. He quickly added, \u201cI never forget it.\u201d\nNever?\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d\nBut then he said, \u201cI\u2019m 75 years old, and I\u2019m just tired of all that after 33 years.\u201d\nI finally got through to Vincent Chin\u2019s killer to ask him about new information in the public records. I had contacted him several times requesting to talk. No answer. Finally, I made one more call in the hopes to catch him. He answered and remembered me.\nThen he hung up.\nI immediately called back. It was an informal and quick conversation, but he answered my questions about his potential financial windfall.\nThe documents revealed Ebens was the beneficiary of a friend\u2019s estate that received a portion of a $4 million dollar personal injury settlement in 2013.\nDid Ebens get any money?\n\u201cNope,\u201d said Ebens. He acknowledged his friend\u2019s wife had received the huge settlement, in which the friend\u2019s estate got 3 percent. But any significant money to Ebens himself?\n\u201cNot really,\u201d he said. \u201cBut whose business is this?\u201d\nThe estate of Vincent Chin, of course.\nIn 1987, a civil suit for the unlawful death of Chin was settled and Ebens was ordered to pay $1.5 million, representing Chin\u2019s projected lost income as an engineer. Even conservatively estimating an income of $50,000 for 30 years, Chin\u2019s life was woefully undervalued at $1.5 million.\nBut Ebens has dodged payment by moving to Nevada, where he says he lives off his Social Security. Meanwhile, what\u2019s owed to the Chin estate reached $8 million in 2012 and continues to grow with interest.\nAccording to sources close to the estate, Ebens actually did receive a token sum as a beneficiary, substitute plaintiff, and executor. The amount was as little as $10,000 for his involvement, which hardly makes a dent in what he owes the Chin estate.\nBut at this stage more than three decades after Chin\u2019s death, some still feel every penny should have gone to the Chin estate.\nEbens has never held much regard for his financial obligation.\n\u201cIt was ridiculous then, it\u2019s ridiculous now,\u201d Ebens said in my 2012 interview with him on the matter.\nEbens\u2019 words drew the ire of author and activist Helen Zia, executor of the Chin estate. \u201cIt shows little or no caring, and a lack of remorse,\u201d said Zia on Wednesday.\nWriter and activist Helen Zia speaks at New York City Chinatown event for the 10th anniversary of Vincent Chin\u2019s death in 1992. (photo by Corky Lee)\nBut the writer activist didn\u2019t stop there in my conversation with her. Zia thinks even the Boston Bomber has made a better apology than Ebens.\n\u201cEbens has seen Vincent Chin\u2019s mother [Lily, who died in 2002] in total grief many times,\u201d Zia said. \u201cNever was there a flicker of \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I killed your son, and the grandchildren you hoped for.\u2019\u201d\nFor Zia, it\u2019s a matter of Ebens saying exactly what he is sorry for.\n\u201cHe\u2019s only said he\u2019s sorry for what happened to his own life, as he said to you when you interviewed him in 2012,\u201d Zia told me. \u201cHe has never taken responsibility for the killing and continues to deny any racial motivation.\u201d\nIndeed, the racial component was a key part of the case. Did what happen in the parking lot of the McDonald\u2019s in suburban Detroit\u2013when Ebens struck Chin twice to the head with a baseball bat\u2013amount to a hate crime?\nEbens was allowed to plea bargain from 2nd degree murder to manslaughter in order to escape prison time.\nThe public reaction led to a federal prosecution of Ebens, who was found guilty of violating Chin\u2019s civil rights. But that judgment was overturned on appeal, and Ebens was cleared of those charges in a subsequent trial.\nEbens never served time in prison.\nAnd as far as the wrongful death settlement, in which dollars might bring a financial sense of justice, Ebens has managed to elude even that.\n\u201cThe estate is not actually expecting to see any real recovery,\u201d Zia said when we wrapped up our recent conversation. \u201cBut we are committed to seeing that Vincent Chin\u2019s killer never have a day without a reminder of the life he took and the impact that had.\u201d\nMaybe Ebens is being straight with me when he says he never forgets Vincent Chin.\nBut the public seems to forget even faster as the Chin story appears to fade with time.\nEven Zia admits, as a new generation passes, that what Ebens did to Chin seems to many like ancient history.\nBut the iconic example of anti-Asian American violence happened in 1982. And given the Charleston shooting and xenophobic fears in a white minority America, it could certainly happen again.\nThirty-three years and counting, as another anniversary passes, the search for justice continues.\nAsian Americans can ill afford to forget either the brutal death of Vincent Chin or the moral and financial debt still owed by Ronald Ebens.\nEmil Guillermo is an independent journalist/commentator.

Before slipping into a coma, Chin\u2019s last words were, \u201cIt\u2019s not fair.\u201d\nArrested and released that same night, Ronald Ebens and Michael Nitz were charged with second-degree murder which they plead down to manslaughter.

      "text": "The wetlands found across the Rocky Mountains of Colorado just below tree line are magical places. Dripping with mosses and deep green sedges, these open expanses flanked by evergreens are a breathtaking sight for passing hikers. Moose graze there, and elk gather during their mating season.\nThese subalpine wetlands are also crucial for regulating the supply of clean water from the highlands to metropolitan regions downslope, including Denver.\nHowever, new research shows the wetlands also harbor a health risk. In a new study, my research group found that just below the surface of subalpine wetland soils, the perfect conditions exist for the production of methylmercury, a potent, toxic form of the heavy metal mercury that can threaten the health of wildlife and people.\nAs rising temperatures thaw ice and erode the mountain rocks, and mercury pollution from power plants around the world falls with rain, this toxic form of mercury can be produced in the wetlands.\nThe Goldilocks problem\nMethylmercury is a neurotoxin that biomagnifies and bioaccumulates, meaning it becomes more concentrated as it moves up the food chain. Predatory birds and fish high on the food chain are most susceptible to its devastating effects on the nervous and reproductive systems, as are the human populations that consume them.\nIn the 1950s, hundreds of people in Minamata and Niigata, Japan, died from methylmercury poisoning connected to ingesting water, fish and shellfish from near where chemical plants were discharging mercury into the water.\nMercury methylation is a fickle process. The bacteria involved require sources of inorganic mercury and energy, as well as oxygen-free conditions.\nSulfate concentrations are particularly important. Like in \u201cGoldilocks and the Three Bears,\u201d too much or too little sulfate is unsatisfactory to the methylating microbes \u2013 those creating methylmercury. Too little sulfate, and they won\u2019t stimulate mercury methylation. Too much sulfate, and mercury gets sequestered in mineral form, minimizing its risk to living organisms.\nYet, when moderate sulfate concentrations mix with inorganic mercury and organic carbon in a low-oxygen environment, the conditions are dangerously \u201cjust right,\u201d as Goldilocks would say, and methylmercury production is high.\nNew evidence of methylmercury\nPrior to our study, most wetlands found to have methylmercury pollution were in lowland areas, such as the Florida Everglades, where the process is fed by sulfate runoff from agriculture fields. However, our study demonstrates that methylmercury production occurs in seemingly remote mountain locations, too.\nThere are a few reasons why conditions in Colorado\u2019s subalpine wetlands are just right.\nFirst, the soil has ample organic matter, providing a deep store of energy in the form of carbon to fuel methylation. In Colorado\u2019s subalpine wetlands, thick soils are rich in layer upon layer of ancient organic matter that saturates with snowmelt flowing from the highest peaks.\nSecond, mercury pollution from industrial centers reaches the Rocky Mountains. Most of the mercury that enters subalpine wetlands has actually traveled all the way from China and India. Eventually, it falls out of the atmosphere in rain or dust, and high elevations receive more of it than low elevations.\nThird \u2013 and this is the key stimulating effect for methylating bacteria \u2013 subalpine wetlands receive excess sulfate from warming alpine areas in elevations above them. As rising air temperatures drive the thawing of ice and quicker rates of mineral weathering, more sulfate than was already in the ground flows into streams to the subalpine region.\nThe result is that these ingredients mix in the flooded, often oxygen-free environment of the wetland soils, and bacteria have everything they need to produce methylmercury.\nOur study showed that the concentrations of methylmercury are higher at the outlet than the inlet of subalpine wetlands that we studied in the Colorado Rockies, providing further evidence that wetlands can be a source of the contaminant.\nApart from the local effects of methylmercury on wildlife, our discovery highlights a concern for water supplies. Over 3 million people in the Boulder-Denver metropolitan area rely on clean, fresh water from the mountains. Contamination of the source area by methylmercury may have large-scale ramifications, such as costly treatment measures, for the entire Colorado Front Range\u2019s drinking water supply.\nHow to lower the risk\nHigh-elevation ecosystems around the world are experiencing many effects that can feed the production of methylmercury.\nIn every state in the U.S., there is at least one mercury toxicity warning for surface waters, typically urging people not to eat fish or shellfish caught there or to limit the amount they eat. Greater production of methylmercury, and its threat to food and water sources, is now a part of our changing world.\nSo, what can be done to avoid the risk?\nLowering mercury deposition requires curbing industrial emissions. In 2013, over 140 nations, including the U.S., signed the Minamata Convention on Mercury, committing to regulate and monitor industrial mercury sources. Remaining committed to this agreement is critical.\nReducing the flow of sulfate from ice and rock weathering in the mountains \u2013 another key ingredient to this process \u2013 requires addressing climate change.\nPeople, governments and industries can take many steps to slow the rise of air temperatures that are increasing ice thaw, from not driving gas-powered vehicles as much to regulating carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and factories. Our new research on methylmercury shows another reason why taking steps to slow climate change are worth the effort."

      "text": "Vincent Chin was killed 40 years ago. Here's why his case continues to resonate\nForty years ago, 27-year-old Vincent Chin was enjoying a night out with his friends in Detroit. It was meant to be a celebration ahead of Chin's upcoming marriage, but he didn't make it to the wedding. That night he was beaten to death by two white men who worked in the auto industry and, according to witnesses, were angry over what they perceived as the loss of American jobs to Japanese imports.\nThe men targeted Chin because he was Asian \u2013 not knowing he was Chinese American, not Japanese. The killing galvanized Asian Americans across the entire country to fight for civil rights. It's a battle that continues today.\nIt's become particularly relevant in the past two years, as racist attacks against Asian Americans have risen exponentially since the start of the pandemic. At least 10,905 hate incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders were recorded from March 19, 2020, through Dec. 31, 2021, according to the coalition Stop AAPI Hate.\nChin's death on June 23, 1982, came at a time when the Japanese automotive industry was a flashpoint for racism. Today's hate incidents can be traced in large part to the anti-Asian rhetoric used at the beginning of the pandemic, including that by former President Donald Trump who referred to the coronavirus as \"the Chinese virus.\"\nThe similarities between the rhetoric used 40 years ago and today present a chilling pattern, says social justice activist Helen Zia, who is also the executor of the estate of Vincent Chin and his mother, Lily.\n\"That was what was going on in America in the 1980s. And that's why as soon as that callout in the White House was pointing the fingers at China, everybody Asian American knew that that was going to land very hard on Asians in America,\" Zia told NPR's All Things Considered in reference to the former president's remarks.\n\"So, yes, the rhetoric, the innuendo \u2013 it has its impact. And when people are targeted and scapegoated, we know that that's only going to be bad for every American.\"\nThe fact that Chin was Chinese American, Zia said, is also telling about how Asian Americans are perceived in the U.S.\n\"Asian Americans have always been lumped together, even though Asia is the largest continent on the planet,\" she said. \"And so when people have hate or anger directed at some nebulous thing about Asia , it doesn't matter. If you're Asian, you're a target. And that's what's going on today. Every different ethnicity of Asian American has suffered the hate incidents that are going on today.\"\nZia is one of the organizers of the Vincent Chin 40th Remembrance & Rededication happening in Detroit this weekend. Events, including film screenings, public art, performances and panel discussions started on Thursday and go through Sunday.\nDavid Han, commissioner of the Michigan Asian Pacific American Affairs Commission, spoke at the official kickoff event. He told member station WDET the rededication also serves as a reminder that \"underneath the surface things are not OK,\" and that people in power play a role in the safety of the communities they represent.\n\"In leadership roles of any kind, whether it's the presidency or leaders in companies, leaders in our communities or even leaders in our churches, the positions and the narratives that different folks speak, based on self-interest as well as fear, certainly impacts the Asian community in America,\" Han said.\nWhile political leaders play a role in combating anti-Asian American sentiments, so do average citizens. Connecting the older and younger generations through Chin's legacy is another aim of the commemoration.\n\"The Vincent Chin Legacy Guide\" was put together by Zia, with help from the Smithsonian Asian Pacific American Center. It's a teaching tool that tells the story of what happened 40 years ago. It is also meant to inspire people to take action.\nIt ultimately shows why Chin's case still matters today.\n\"It really stands out as a landmark, not only for Asian Americans \u2013 it stands out as a landmark in American history,\" Zia said. \"It's a time when a people in America, who were treated as though they were aliens \u2014 those people stood up and said, 'this is wrong. And not only that \u2014 we are a part of the American democracy, and we deserve to be treated as full Americans and full human beings.'\""

His killing and subsequent court proceedings marked the beginning of the modern Asian American civil rights movement nationwide.\nThat story has been extensively reported, including an award-winning 1987 documentary \u201cWho Killed Vincent Chin?\u201d co-produced by Detroit PBS. The city of Detroit installed a new street sign on June 23 in Chin\u2019s memory where a vibrant Chinatown once stood at the corner of Cass Avenue and Peterboro Street.\nThe street sign \u201cVincent Chin Street\u201d was unveiled by Roland Hwang, Co-Founder of American Citizens for Justice, Richard Mui, President of the Association of Chinese Americans Detroit, State Senator Stephanie Chang and Detroit City Council Member Gabriela Santiago-Romero.\n\u201cWe are here to thank the city of Detroit,\u201d said Hwang, who explained the city required an ordinance change to allow a non-resident to be recognized with a street sign. Chin lived in Oak Park at the time of his death.\nAlso in attendance was Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan. Chin was killed when Duggan was a law school student. Wayne County Circuit Judge Charles Kaufman would issue probation sentences to the two men convicted in Chin\u2019s death.\n\u201cIt hit me particularly because one of Judge Kaufman\u2019s colleagues on the Wayne County Circuit Court was my father, who was also a judge. I called him that night, so angry,\u201d Duggan said.\nThe new sign fits in with efforts to bring new life to the neighborhood. Many of the people who once lived there moved to the suburbs decades ago. The long-closed Chung\u2019s restaurant building is still standing, has been renovated and awaits tenants, according to One Detroit journalism partner BridgeDetroit. Also, last year a one-million-dollar streetscape project was announced that is expected to revitalize the area.\nAt the street sign unveiling, the Detroit Chinatown Vision Committee announced the First Annual Chinatown Block Party to be held Saturday, July 26 from noon to 8 p.m. at the Detroit Shipping Company. The community celebration will include food and cultural entertainment.\nOne Detroit\u2019s Zosette Guir and Bill Kubota visited the street sign installation ceremony and heard from the co-chairs of the Detroit Chinatown Vision Committee, Francis Grunow and Sandy Fatt along with Matt Hessler, the owner of one of the last original Chinatown buildings, which he acquired 10 years ago. They also talked to the owner of a Chinese restaurant in the area called The Peterboro, which opened nearly a decade ago \u2014 long after the original restaurants left.\nStay Connected\nSubscribe to One Detroit\u2019s YouTube Channel and don\u2019t miss One Detroit on Thursdays at 7:30 p.m. and Sundays at 9 a.m. on Detroit PBS, WTVS-Channel 56.\nCatch the daily conversations on our website, Facebook, Twitter @OneDetroit_PBS, and Instagram @One.Detroit\nRelated Posts\nLeave a Reply\nYour email address will not be published.

      "text": "U.S. Rep. Jim Banks of Indiana sent a letter to fellow Republicans on June 24, 2021, stating: \u201cAs Republicans, we reject the racial essentialism that critical race theory teaches \u2026 that our institutions are racist and need to be destroyed from the ground up.\u201d\nKimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, a law professor and central figure in the development of critical race theory, said in a recent interview that critical race theory \u201cjust says, let\u2019s pay attention to what has happened in this country, and how what has happened in this country is continuing to create differential outcomes. \u2026 Critical Race Theory \u2026 is more patriotic than those who are opposed to it because \u2026 we believe in the promises of equality. And we know we can\u2019t get there if we can\u2019t confront and talk honestly about inequality.\u201d\nRep. Banks\u2019 account is demonstrably false and typical of many people publicly declaring their opposition to critical race theory. Crenshaw\u2019s characterization, while true, does not detail its main features. So what is critical race theory and what brought it into existence?\nThe development of critical race theory by legal scholars such as Derrick Bell and Crenshaw was largely a response to the slow legal progress and setbacks faced by African Americans from the end of the Civil War, in 1865, through the end of the civil rights era, in 1968. To understand critical race theory, you need to first understand the history of African American rights in the U.S.\nThe history\nAfter 304 years of enslavement, then-former slaves gained equal protection under the law with passage of the 14th Amendment in 1868. The 15th Amendment, in 1870, guaranteed voting rights for men regardless of race or \u201cprevious condition of servitude.\u201d\nBetween 1866 and 1877 \u2013 the period historians call \u201cRadical Reconstruction\u201d \u2013 African Americans began businesses, became involved in local governance and law enforcement and were elected to Congress.\nThis early progress was subsequently diminished by state laws throughout the American South called \u201cBlack Codes,\u201d which limited voting rights, property rights and compensation for work; made it illegal to be unemployed or not have documented proof of employment; and could subject prisoners to work without pay on behalf of the state. These legal rollbacks were worsened by the spread of \u201cJim Crow\u201d laws throughout the country requiring segregation in almost all aspects of life.\nGrassroots struggles for civil rights were constant in post-Civil War America. Some historians even refer to the period from the New Deal Era, which began in 1933, to the present as \u201cThe Long Civil Rights Movement.\u201d\nThe period stretching from Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, which found school segregation to be unconstitutional, to the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which prohibited discrimination in housing, was especially productive.\nThe civil rights movement used practices such as civil disobedience, nonviolent protest, grassroots organizing and legal challenges to advance civil rights. The U.S.\u2019s need to improve its image abroad during the Cold War importantly aided these advancements. The movement succeeded in banning explicit legal discrimination and segregation, promoted equal access to work and housing and extended federal protection of voting rights.\nHowever, the movement that produced legal advances had no effect on the increasing racial wealth gap between Blacks and whites, while school and housing segregation persisted.\nWhat critical race theory is\nCritical race theory is a field of intellectual inquiry that demonstrates the legal codification of racism in America.\nThrough the study of law and U.S. history, it attempts to reveal how racial oppression shaped the legal fabric of the U.S. Critical race theory is traditionally less concerned with how racism manifests itself in interactions with individuals and more concerned with how racism has been, and is, codified into the law.\nThere are a few beliefs commonly held by most critical race theorists.\nFirst, race is not fundamentally or essentially a matter of biology, but rather a social construct. While physical features and geographic origin play a part in making up what we think of as race, societies will often make up the rest of what we think of as race. For instance, 19th- and early-20th-century scientists and politicians frequently described people of color as intellectually or morally inferior, and used those false descriptions to justify oppression and discrimination.\nSecond, these racial views have been codified into the nation\u2019s foundational documents and legal system. For evidence of that, look no further than the \u201cThree-Fifths Compromise\u201d in the Constitution, whereby slaves, denied the right to vote, were nonetheless treated as part of the population for increasing congressional representation of slave-holding states.\nThird, given the pervasiveness of racism in our legal system and institutions, racism is not aberrant, but a normal part of life.\nFourth, multiple elements, such as race and gender, can lead to kinds of compounded discrimination that lack the civil rights protections given to individual, protected categories. For example, Crenshaw has forcibly argued that there is a lack of legal protection for Black women as a category. The courts have treated Black women as Black, or women, but not both in discrimination cases \u2013 despite the fact that they may have experienced discrimination because they were both.\nThese beliefs are shared by scholars in a variety of fields who explore the role of racism in areas such as education, health care and history.\nFinally, critical race theorists are interested not just in studying the law and systems of racism, but in changing them for the better.\nWhat critical race theory is not\n\u201cCritical race theory\u201d has become a catch-all phrase among legislators attempting to ban a wide array of teaching practices concerning race. State legislators in Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and West Virginia have introduced legislation banning what they believe to be critical race theory from schools.\nBut what is being banned in education, and what many media outlets and legislators are calling \u201ccritical race theory,\u201d is far from it. Here are sections from identical legislation in Oklahoma and Tennessee that propose to ban the teaching of these concepts. As a philosopher of race and racism, I can safely say that critical race theory does not assert the following:\n(1) One race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex;\n(2) An individual, by virtue of the individual\u2019s race or sex, is inherently privileged, racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or subconsciously;\n(3) An individual should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment because of the individual\u2019s race or sex;\n(4) An individual\u2019s moral character is determined by the individual\u2019s race or sex;\n(5) An individual, by virtue of the individual\u2019s race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex;\n(6) An individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or another form of psychological distress solely because of the individual\u2019s race or sex.\nWhat most of these bills go on to do is limit the presentation of educational materials that suggest that Americans do not live in a meritocracy, that foundational elements of U.S. laws are racist, and that racism is a perpetual struggle from which America has not escaped.\nAmericans are used to viewing their history through a triumphalist lens, where we overcome hardships, defeat our British oppressors and create a country where all are free with equal access to opportunities.\nObviously, not all of that is true.\nCritical race theory provides techniques to analyze U.S. history and legal institutions by acknowledging that racial problems do not go away when we leave them unaddressed.\n[Understand what\u2019s going on in Washington.

      "text": "WHO IS VINCENT CHIN?\nVincent Chin was a 27-year-old Chinese American attending his all-American bachelor party in Detroit on June 19, 1982 to celebrate his upcoming wedding. That night, he was brutally beaten to death by two white men in an era of Anti-Asian hate. His death gave birth to a movement.\nWHO IS VINCENT CHIN?\nVincent worked two jobs\u2013a draftsman by day in Oak Park and a waiter on weekends at a Chinese restaurant in Ferndale. He also attended night school to learn computer operations.\nVincent was well-liked by coworkers and supervisors for his friendly, easy-going nature as well as his strong work ethic and skills. Instead of celebrating his wedding, his 400 guests attended his funeral.\nRemembering Vincent Chin and His Family\nYoung Vincent was an outgoing boy with a ready smile who was always popular in school. He was an avid reader, wrote poetry, and, like his parents, was involved with Detroit's Chinese American community centered in the Cass corridor, where Chinatown was then located.\nVincent was the only child of Lily and C.W. Hing Chin, a Highland Park couple who adopted him from a Chinese orphanage when he was six. Lily and David, a U.S. Army veteran who fought in World War II, were both working-class immigrants from China's Guangdong province. They labored in Detroit's Chinese laundries and restaurants\u2013the few industries where Asian immigrants could find jobs. His father passed away in 1981, and Vincent and his fianc\u00e9e were looking for a house with room for his mother Lily.\nBy 1982, Vincent and his fianc\u00e9e had planned for a June wedding. Vincent worked two jobs-- a draftsman by day in Oak Park and a waiter on weekends at a Chinese restaurant in Ferndale. He also attended night school to learn computer operations. Vincent\u2019s father had died in 1981 and the couple was looking for a house with room for his mother Lily. Vincent was well-liked by coworkers and supervisors for his friendly, easy-going nature as well has his strong work ethic and skills. Instead of celebrating his wedding, his 400 guests attended his funeral.\nThe Night of June 19, 1982\nWitnesses at the bar overheard Ronald Ebens say, \"It's because of you motherf---s that we're out of work\"\u2013an allusion to the massive layoffs and unemployment caused by the collapse of the auto industry. Vincent objected and a fight took place in the bar; outside, the killers took a baseball bat from their car and stalked Vincent and one of his buddies.\nEbens and his stepson, Michael Nitz, paid $20 to a neighborhood passerby to help them \"Get the Chinese.\" The killers spotted Vincent and his friend as they waited for a bus in front of a crowded McDonald's. Surprising Vincent from behind, Nitz grabbed Vincent and held him down while Ebens swung the bat into Vincent's head, \"as if going for a home run,\" reported witnesses. Four days later, Vincent's widowed mother Lily Chin removed her son from life support.\nMISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE\nThe horrific hate-filled slaying of Vincent Chin would have been tragic enough, but on March 16, 1983, the two killers were sentenced after pleading \"no contest\" to a reduced charge of manslaughter and freed without spending a day in jail.\nDefense attorneys told the sentencing judge, Charles Kaufman, that Vincent started the fight against the two white defendants, who appeared in court clean, wearing suits, never having spent a day in jail. No prosecutor was present to refute the claim, and no family members had been notified that the sentencing was to take place.\nAfter 15 minutes of proceedings, Kaufman sentenced Ebens and Nitz to three years' probation and $3,000 in fines. Explaining his sentence, Kaufman said, \"These aren't the kind of men you send to jail.\"\nModern Day Asian American Civil Rights Movement\nAfter the shocking sentence of probation for a violent murder, the disparate Asian American communities of Detroit came together for the first time to seek equal justice from the legal system.\nThis pan-Asian effort brought together different Asian ethnicities together across culture, language, immigration experience, class backgrounds all to stand against racism and to fight for equality. His case ignited the modern Asian American civil rights movement and built a multiracial, multicultural coalition united for equal justice and human dignity, which stands as a landmark of American history. Since 1983, numerous pan-Asian legal advocacy organizations, many grassroots community groups and newer generations of young AAPI activists have emerged as a direct result of the campaign for justice for Vincent Chin.\nDefense attorneys told the sentencing judge, Charles Kaufman, that Vincent started the fight against the two white defendants, who appeared in court clean, wearing suits, never having spent a day in jail. No prosecutor was present to refute the claim, and no family members had been notified that the sentencing was to take place.\nAfter 15 minutes of proceedings, Kaufman sentenced Ebens and Nitz to three years' probation and $3,000 in fines. Explaining his sentence, Kaufman said, \"These aren't the kind of men you send to jail.\"\nWhy Vincent Chin\u2019s Legacy Matters Today\nToday, more than four decades later, the legacy of Vincent Chin and the campaign for justice offers lessons to all on how people of all races, including between Asian and Black Americans, and from all creeds and walks of life, can organize and come together to stand against intolerance of all kinds to build a beloved community that is safe and welcoming to all. That is the vision and goal of VCI.\nA Message From Helen Zia on Behalf of the Vincent & Lily Chin Estate\n\u201cToday's anti-Asian hate has uncanny parallels to the anti-Asian hate of the 1980s. The Vincent Chin movement\u2019s founding principles are the legacy of solidarity: in 1983, we declared our commitment to equal justice FOR ALL and a stand against racism and discrimination OF ANY KIND.\nAs Vincent\u2019s mother Lily courageously said on national television, \u201cOur skin color is different, but our blood is the same.\u201d The Vincent Chin Institute continues the Vincent Chin movement\u2019s legacy to advance the ideals of equal justice, solidarity against racism and hate, and a commitment to the right all families and communities to live in safety, without fear of violence.\u201d\n\u2014 Helen Zia, Executor, Estate of Lily and Vincent Chin"

      "text": "In a recent Washington Post op-ed, former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang called upon Asian Americans to become part of the solution against COVID-19.\nIn the face of rising anti-Asian racist actions \u2013 now at about 100 reported cases per day \u2013 Yang implores Asian Americans to \u201cwear red, white, and blue\u201d in their efforts to combat the virus.\nOptimistically, before Donald Trump declared COVID-19 as the \u201cChinese virus,\u201d Yang believed that \u201cgetting the virus under control\u201d would rid this country of its anti-Asian racism. But Asian American history, my field of research, suggests a sobering reality.\nA history of anti-Asian racism\nUp until the eve of the COVID-19 crisis, the prevailing narrative about Asian Americans was one of the model minority.\nThe model minority concept, developed during and after World War II, posits that Asian Americans were the ideal immigrants of color to the United States due to their economic success.\nBut in the United States, Asian Americans have long been considered as a threat to a nation that promoted a whites-only immigration policy. They were called a \u201cyellow peril\u201d: unclean and unfit for citizenship in America.\nIn the late 19th century, white nativists spread xenophobic propaganda about Chinese uncleanliness in San Francisco. This fueled the passage of the infamous Chinese Exclusion Act, the first law in the United States that barred immigration solely based on race. Initially, the act placed a 10-year moratorium on all Chinese migration.\nIn the early 20th century, American officials in the Philippines, then a formal colony of the U.S., denigrated Filipinos for their supposedly unclean and uncivilized bodies. Colonial officers and doctors identified two enemies: Filipino insurgents against American rule, and \u201ctropical diseases\u201d festering in native bodies. By pointing to Filipinos\u2019 political and medical unruliness, these officials justified continued U.S. colonial rule in the islands.\nOn February 19, 1942, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 to incarcerate people under suspicion as enemies to inland internment camps.\nWhile the order also affected German- and Italian-Americans on the East Coast, the vast majority of those incarcerated in 1942 were of Japanese descent. Many of them were naturalized citizens, second- and third-generation Americans. Internees who fought in the celebrated 442nd Regiment were coerced by the United States military to prove their loyalty to a country that locked them up simply for being Japanese.\nIn the 21st century, even the most \u201cmulticultural\u201d North American cities, like my hometown of Toronto, Canada, are hotbeds for virulent racism. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, Toronto saw a rise of anti-Asian racism, much like that of today.\nIn her 2008 study, sociologist Carrianne Leung highlights the everyday racism against Chinese and Filipina health care workers in the years that followed the SARS crisis. While publicly celebrated for their work in hospitals and other health facilities, these women found themselves fearing for their lives on their way home.\nNo expression of patriotism \u2013 not even being front-line workers in a pandemic \u2013 makes Asian migrants immune to racism.\nMaking the model minority\nOver the past decade, from Pulitzer Prizes to popular films, Asian Americans have slowly been gaining better representation in Hollywood and other cultural industries.\nWhereas \u201cThe Joy Luck Club\u201d had long been the most infamous depiction of Asian-ness in Hollywood, by the 2018 Golden Globes, Sandra Oh declared her now famous adage: \u201cIt\u2019s an honor just to be Asian.\u201d It was, at least at face value, a moment of cultural inclusion.\nHowever, so-called Asian American inclusion has a dark side.\nIn reality, as cultural historian Robert G. Lee has argued, inclusion can and has been used to undermine the activism of African Americans, indigenous peoples and other marginalized groups in the United States. In the words of writer Frank Chin in 1974, \u201cWhites love us because we\u2019re not black.\u201d\nFor example, in 1943, a year after the United States incarcerated Japanese Americans under Executive Order 9066, Congress repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act. White liberals advocated for the repeal not out of altruism toward Chinese migrants, but to advocate for a transpacific alliance against Japan and the Axis powers.\nBy allowing for the free passage of Chinese migrants to the United States, the nation could show its supposed fitness as an interracial superpower that rivaled Japan and Germany. Meanwhile, incarcerated Japanese Americans in camps and African Americans were still held under Jim Crow segregation laws.\nIn her new book, \u201cOpening the Gates to Asia: A Transpacific History of How America Repealed Asian Exclusion,\u201d Occidental College historian Jane Hong reveals how the United States government used Asian immigration inclusion against other minority groups at a time of social upheaval.\nFor example, in 1965, Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s administration signed the much-celebrated Hart-Celler Act into law. The act primarily targeted Asian and African migrants, shifting immigration from an exclusionary quota system to an merit-based points system. However, it also imposed immigration restrictions on Latin America.\nBeyond model minority politics\nAs history shows, Asian American communities stand to gain more working within communities and across the lines of race, rather than trying to appeal to those in power.\nJapanese American activists such as the late Yuri Kochiyama worked in solidarity with other communities of color to advance the civil rights movement.\nA former internee at the Jerome Relocation Center in Arkansas, Kochiyama\u2019s postwar life in Harlem, and her friendship with Malcolm X, inspired her to become active in the anti-Vietnam War and civil rights movements. In the 1980s, she and her husband Bill, himself part of the 442nd Regiment, worked at the forefront of the reparations and apology movement for Japanese internees. As a result of their efforts, Ronald Reagan signed the resulting Civil Liberties Act into law in 1988.\nKochiyama and activists like her have inspired the cross-community work of Asian American communities after them.\nIn Los Angeles, where I live, the Little Tokyo Service Center is among those at the forefront of grassroots organizing for affordable housing and social services in a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood. While the organization\u2019s priority area is Little Tokyo and its community members, the center\u2019s work advocates for affordable housing among black and Latinx residents, as well as Japanese American and other Asian American groups.\nTo the northwest in Koreatown, the grassroots organization Ktown for All conducts outreach to unhoused residents of the neighborhood, regardless of ethnic background.\nThe coronavirus sees no borders. Likewise, I think that everyone must follow the example of these organizations and activists, past and present, to reach across borders and contribute to collective well-being.\nSelf-isolation, social distancing and healthy practices should not be in the service of proving one\u2019s patriotism. Instead, these precautions should be done for the sake of caring for those whom we do and do not know, inside and outside our national communities.\n[Get the best of The Conversation, every weekend.

      "text": "For the first time, in 1990, May was officially designated as a month honoring Asian American and Pacific Islander heritage. Though the current U.S. administration recently withdrew federal recognition, the month continues to be celebrated by a wide array of people from diverse cultural backgrounds.\nPeople from the Pacific Islands have their own distinct histories and issues, delineated in part by a specific geography. Yet when we refer to the even broader category of Asian Americans, a concept with a deep yet often unknown history, who exactly are we referring to?\nThere are nearly 25 million people of Asian descent who live in the United States, but the term Asian American remains shrouded by cultural misunderstanding and contested as a term among Asians themselves.\nAs a professor of Asian American studies, I believe it is important to understand how the label came into being.\nA long history of Asian people in America\nThe arrival of people from Asia to the U.S. long predates the country\u2019s founding in 1776.\nAfter visits to modern-day America that began in the late 16th century, Filipino sailors formed \u2013 as early as 1763 \u2013 what is believed to be the first Asian settlement in St. Malo, Louisiana.\nBut it wasn\u2019t until the 1849 California Gold Rush that Asian immigration to the U.S. \u2013 from China \u2013 began on a mass scale. That was bolstered in the 1860s by Chinese laborers recruited to build the western portion of the Transcontinental Railroad.\nStarting toward the end of the 19th century, Japanese immigration steadily picked up, so that by 1910 the U.S. Census records a similar number for both communities \u2013 just over 70,000. Likewise, a small number of South Asian immigrants began arriving in the early 1900s.\nAn exclusionary backlash\nYet after coming to the U.S. in search of economic and political opportunities, Asian laborers in America were met by a surge of white nativist hostility and violence. That reaction was codified in civil society groups and government laws, such as the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882.\nBy 1924, federal law had expanded into a virtual ban on all Asian immigration, and through the first half of the 20th century, a multitude of anti-Asian laws targeted areas including naturalization, marriage and housing, among others.\nFrom the start, people from Asian countries in the U.S. were generally identified broadly with identifiers such as \u201cOriental,\u201d a common term at the time mostly for those from China, Japan and Korea.\nAs more Asians came to the U.S, other terms were used to denigrate and demean these new immigrants, whose physical appearance, language and cultural norms were distinctly different from their Euro-American neighbors.\n\u2018Asian American\u2019 and the birth of a movement\nThe desire to claim America was one of the drivers for activists in the 1960s to create the concept of Asian American that we know today.\nThe movement began in the charged political context of anti-Vietnam War protests and the Civil Rights Movement for Black equality. Students of Asian heritage at San Francisco State University and the University of California, Berkeley were organizing for the establishment of ethnic studies classes, specifically those that centered on the histories of Asians in the U.S.\nRejecting the term \u201coriental\u201d as too limiting and exotic, since oriental literally means \u201cfrom the East,\u201d the student activists wanted a term of empowerment that would include the Filipino, Chinese, Korean and Japanese students at the heart of this organizing. Graduate students Emma Gee and Yuji Ichioka came up with \u201cAsian American\u201d as a way to bring activists under one radical organizing umbrella, forming the Asian American Political Alliance in 1968.\nA contested term\nToday, the Asian American label has moved beyond its activist roots. The term might literally refer to anyone who traces their lineage from the whole of the Asian continent. This could include people from South Asian countries such as India, Pakistan or Sri Lanka to parts of West Asia like Syria, Lebanon or Iran.\nYet not all people who identify as Asian actually use the words Asian American, since it is a term that flattens ethnic specificity and lumps together people with as disparate of backgrounds as Hmong or Bangladeshi, for example.\nA 2023 Pew Research Center survey of self-identified Asian adults living in the U.S. revealed that only 16% of people polled said they identified as \u201cAsian American,\u201d with a majority \u2013 52% \u2013 preferring ethnic Asian labels, either alone or in tandem with \u201cAmerican.\u201d\nMoreover, unlike the student activists who worked together through their shared Asian American identity, the majority of people of Asian descent living in the U.S. came after the 1965 Immigration Act was passed, which ended all prior anti-Asian immigration laws. This, combined with a subsequent wave of Asian immigration from parts of Asia not represented in the past \u2013 including Vietnam, Taiwan and Pakistan \u2013 means that most Asian Americans alive today are either immigrants or one generation removed from immigrants.\nAs a largely immigrant and recently Americanized group, many Asians therefore may not relate to the struggles of an earlier history of Asians in the U.S. That may contribute to why many don\u2019t connect with the term \u201cAsian American.\u201d Korean immigrants, for instance, may not see their history connected with third-generation Japanese Americans, particularly when considering their homelands have been in conflict for decades.\nFor some, Asian American is too broad a term to capture the complexity of Asian-heritage Americans.\nIndeed, Asian Americans come from over 30 countries with different languages, diverse cultures, and histories that have often been in conflict with other Asian nations. Within such a broad grouping as \u201cAsian American,\u201d a wide range of political, socioeconomic, religious and other differences emerge that greatly complicate this racial label.\nEven though the term remains contested, many Asians still see value in the concept. Much like the activists who first created the label in the 1960s, many believe it signifies a sense of solidarity and community among people who \u2013 despite their many differences \u2013 have been treated like outsiders to the American experience, regardless of how American their roots are."

      "text": "For more than 50 years, Asian American studies has been a recognized field at American colleges and universities. But outside of California, students who want to study it as a major or minor are usually out of luck.\nHowever, the tide is beginning to turn.\nDuke University created an academic minor in Asian American studies in 2022. Harvard University, long criticized for not offering enough courses in ethnic studies, hired two tenured faculty members in Asian American studies over the past two years.\nVanderbilt University announced its new major and minor in the field in 2023. That same year, Williams College started its concentration, akin to a minor, and Fordham University started its minor.\nAmherst College, where I teach, recently created a major in Asian American and Pacific Islander studies, to start in the fall of 2024. Amherst will be the first liberal arts college in the country with its own major in the field.\nSouthern California\u2019s Claremont Colleges \u2013 Claremont McKenna, Harvey Mudd, Pitzer, Pomona and Scripps \u2013 have collectively offered a shared major for 25 years. Public high schools across the country have similarly experienced growth in content on Asian Americans.\nDecades of lobbying\nThese programs did not get going overnight. Students on these campuses \u2013 and others \u2013 campaigned for Asian American studies for years. Across the nation, student activists in the South, the Northeast and the Southwest continue to lobby for more courses and for majors or minors in the field.\nBut if student activism and faculty interest were all it took to achieve curricular change, Asian American studies and related fields would have been popping up on campuses long ago. At Amherst, students had been pushing for greater attention to Asian American studies for 50 years.\nThe recent commitment to teaching more courses and hiring permanent faculty \u2013 as opposed to visiting faculty \u2013 stems, in part, from tragedy. Programs began to grow as attacks on Asian Americans, including the 2021 murders of spa workers in Atlanta, increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Former President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated reference to COVID-19 as the \u201cChinese virus\u201d added rhetorical fuel to racial animosity.\nBattles against discrimination inspire new programs\nHistorically, ethnic studies programs have come into existence after protests against public discrimination. The establishment of Black, Native, Latino and Asian American studies in California followed the Civil Rights Movement and protests of the 1960s.\nThe discriminatory attacks that increased during the pandemic inspired a rise in activism among Asian American students. They wanted to embrace their heritage and see their own histories and experiences represented in course offerings. The attacks also made university administrators recognize that \u2013 contrary to their stereotype as problem-free, high achievers \u2013 Asian Americans experience a unique kind of discrimination in which they are \u201cforever foreign.\u201d They deserve greater attention in the college curriculum.\nAs more schools join the roster of colleges offering programs in Asian American studies, the material included within Asian American studies is also expanding. The most common subjects in the Asian American program are cultural studies, literary studies and other interdisciplinary areas in the humanities. The field also has drawn on history and sociology, subjects that similarly question popular views about which racial groups have been in authority and why.\nNow, prominent topics within Asian American studies include critical race theory and critiques of the United States as an \u201cempire\u201d and U.S. militarization.\nProponents of Asian American studies may be more likely to hold political views such as support for Palestinians and for affirmative action that share the perspectives found in these topics. Given that Asian American studies started in the 1960s and 1970s because of student activism, political activism has remained central to the field.\nThe field\u2019s foundation in the humanities and humanistic social sciences, however, has meant that other disciplines have been left out. This is also changing. In the past two years, for example, the Association for Asian American Studies, the largest professional association in the field, has stressed the need for more attention to the study of Asian America in social sciences such as political science, anthropology, economics and psychology. At an April 2024 symposium, the organization connected faculty from psychology, education, political science and other disciplines to the field and vice versa. It also provided a mentoring program for these faculty.\nThe field will likely continue to add to its areas of representation as it expands on campuses. A more comprehensive look at Asian American experiences may lead to a better understanding of the recent conditions that caused the number of programs on college campuses to increase. Understanding the rise of violence against Asian Americans, for instance, requires knowledge of the U.S. wars in Asia and their connection to individual Americans\u2019 social psychology.\nMore than 50 years ago, Asian American studies were almost unheard of. In another 50 years, perhaps, programs that similarly combine subjects from multiple disciplines may become mainstream."

      "text": "The estate of Vincent Chin has won its fight to keep a lien on a Nevada property occupied by Ronald Ebens, one of the men responsible for Chin's death. Ebens is believed to owe the estate more than $8 million in wrongful death claims.\nA Nevada district court ruled early January that Ebens did not have legal standing to bring the motion to remove the lien.\nIn a one paragraph decision, Judge Kenneth Cory ruled that Ebens\u2019 motion, which was filed last November, was filed improperly. \u201cTherefore, the motion must be denied without consideration of its merits,\u201d court documents, dated Jan. 4, read.\n\u201cWe were surprised by it,\u201d Kenneth Roberts, Ebens\u2019 attorney, told NBC News. \u201cThe house is owned by a trust, even though it is his trust, and apparently the judge felt there was a distinction between the two that he felt was sufficient.\u201d\nRoberts said it will be up to Ebens, 76, to make the next move. Ebens could not be reached for comment.\nThe attorneys of the Chin estate agreed with the judge's denial of Ebens\u2019 motion to remove the lien.\n\u201cIt was procedurally inaccurate and therefore, because we have our rules and regulations to abide by, the court did not even consider the merits,\u201d Geraldine Tomich, lawyer for the Chin estate, told NBC News.\nUnder Nevada law, Ebens home, valued at $150,000 would be within the limit for homestead protection, which allows individuals to protect up to $550,000 worth of assets from creditors in their homes.\n\u201cWe are very pleased,\u201d Tomich said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change a thing. We still have a lien against his house. But that\u2019s all it is, just a lien.\u201d\nRELATED: Man Charged With Vincent Chin's Death Seeks Lien Removed, Still Owes Millions\nRELATED: Vincent Chin's Estate Still Seeking Millions in Settlement Funds\nSince 1982, Chin\u2019s name has been a rallying cry for Asian-American civil rights, but the fight for justice has been a long one for the Chin estate.\nIt began with a trial that drew public outrage when Ebens and his stepson Michael Nitz received a plea deal in 1983, pleading guilty to manslaughter and receiving three years probation and $3,720 fines. Ebens was convicted of violating Chin's civil rights in federal court afterward, but won a retrial and acquittal.\nIn a 1987 civil suit that was settled out of court, Ebens was ordered to pay $1.5 million to the Chin estate, but since then, he has not made payments. The amount owed to the estate is estimated to have grown to more than $8 million.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have an exact figure,\u201d Tomich said. \u201cEvery day is a ticking meter.\u201d"

      "text": "Following the coronavirus outbreak, reports of discrimination and violence toward Asian Americans increased. A previous Pew Research Center survey of English-speaking Asian adults showed that as of 2021, one-third said they feared someone might threaten or physically attack them. English-speaking Asian adults in 2022 were also more likely than other racial or ethnic groups to say they had changed their daily routines due to concerns they might be threatened or attacked.19\nIn this new 2022-23 survey, Asian adults were asked if they personally know another Asian person in the U.S. who had been attacked since the pandemic began.\nAsian adults who personally know an Asian person who has been threatened or attacked since COVID-19\nAbout one-third of Asian adults (32%) say they personally know an Asian person in the U.S. who has been threatened or attacked because of their race or ethnicity since the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020.\nWhether Asian adults know someone with this experience varies across Asian ethnic origin groups:\n- About four-in-ten Chinese adults (39%) say they personally know another Asian person who has been threatened or attacked since the coronavirus outbreak. Similar shares of Korean adults (35%) and those who belong to less populous Asian origin groups (39%) \u2013 those categorized as \u201cother\u201d in this report \u2013 say the same.\n- About three-in-ten Vietnamese (31%), Japanese (28%) and Filipino (28%) Americans and about two-in-ten Indian adults (21%) say they know another Asian person in the U.S. who has been the victim of a racially motivated threat or attack.\nAdditionally, there are some differences by regional origin groups:\n- Overall, similar shares of East and Southeast Asian adults say they know another Asian person who\u2019s been threatened or attacked because of their race or ethnicity (36% and 33%, respectively).\n- A somewhat smaller share of South Asian adults say the same (24%).\nThere are also differences across nativity and immigrant generations:\n- U.S.-born Asian adults are more likely than Asian immigrants to say they know another Asian person who has been threatened or attacked during the COVID-19 pandemic (40% vs. 28%, respectively).\n- Among immigrants, those who are 1.5 generation \u2013 those who came to the U.S. as children \u2013 are more likely than the first generation \u2013 those who immigrated as adults \u2013 to say they know someone with this experience (37% vs. 25%).\n- And among U.S.-born Asian Americans, 44% of second-generation adults say this, compared with 28% of third- or higher-generation Asian adults.\nWhether Asian Americans personally know another Asian person who was threatened or attacked because of their race or ethnicity since the beginning of the pandemic also varies across other demographic groups:\n- Age: 44% of Asian adults under 30 years old say they know someone who has been threatened or attacked during the pandemic, compared with 18% of those 65 and older.\n- Gender: Asian women are somewhat more likely than men to say they know an Asian person in the U.S. who has been threatened or attacked during the COVID-19 pandemic (35% vs. 28%, respectively).\n- Party: 36% of Asian Democrats and Democratic leaners say they know another Asian person who has been threatened or attacked because of their race or ethnicity, higher than the share among Republicans and Republican leaners (25%).\nHeightened anti-Asian discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic\nThese survey findings follow a spike in reports of discrimination against Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of federally recognized hate crime incidents of anti-Asian bias increased from 158 in 2019 to 279 in 2020 and 746 in 2021, according to hate crime statistics published by the FBI. In 2022, the number of anti-Asian hate crimes decreased for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak, to 499 incidents. Between March 2020 and May 2023, the organization Stop AAPI Hate received more than 11,000 self-reported incidents of anti-Asian bias, the vast majority of which involved harassment, bullying, shunning and other discrimination incidents.\nAdditionally, previous research found that calling COVID-19 the \u201cChinese Virus,\u201d \u201cAsian Virus\u201d or other names that attach location or ethnicity to the disease was associated with anti-Asian sentiment in online discourse. Use of these phrases by politicians or other prominent public officials, such as by former President Donald Trump, coincided with greater use among the general public and more frequent instances of bias against Asian Americans.\nIn their own words: Asian Americans\u2019 experiences with discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic\nIn the 2021 Pew Research Center focus groups of Asian Americans, participants discussed their experiences of being discriminated against because of their race or ethnicity during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nParticipants talked about being shamed in both public and private spaces. Some Asian immigrant participants talked about being afraid to speak out because of how it might impact their immigration status:\n\u201cI was walking in [the city where I live], and a White old woman was poking me in the face saying, \u2018You are disgusting,\u2019 and she was trying to hit me. I ran away crying. \u2026 At the time, I was with my boyfriend, but he also just came to the U.S., so we ran away together thinking that if we cause trouble, we could be deported.\u201d\n\u2013Immigrant woman of Korean origin in late 20s (translated from Korean)\n\u201c[A very close friend of mine] lived at [a] school dormitory, and when the pandemic just happened \u2026 his room was directly pasted with the adhesive tape saying things like \u2018Chinese virus quarantine.\u2019\u201d\n\u2013Immigrant man of Chinese origin in early 30s (translated from Mandarin)\nMany participants talked about being targeted because others perceive them as Chinese, regardless of their ethnicity:\n\u201cI think the crimes [that happened] against other Asian people can happen to me while going through COVID-19. When I see a White person, I don\u2019t know if their ancestors are Scottish or German, so they will look at me and think the same. It seems that they can\u2019t distinguish between Korean and Chinese and think that we are from Asia and the onset of COVID-19 is our fault. This is something that can happen to all of us. So I think Asian Americans should come together and let people know that we are also human and we have rights. I came to think about Asian Americans that they shouldn\u2019t stay still even if they\u2019re trampled on.\u201d\n\u2013Immigrant woman of Korean origin in early 50s (translated from Korean)\n\u201cEven when I was just getting on the bus, [people acted] as if I was carrying the virus. People would not sit with me, they would sit a bit far. It was because I look Chinese.\u201d\n\u2013Immigrant woman of Bhutanese origin in early 30s (translated from Dzongkha)\nAmid these incidents, some participants talked about feeling in community and kinship with other Asian people:\n\u201c[When I hear stories about Asian people in the news,] I feel like automatically you just have a sense of connection to someone that\u2019s Asian. \u2026 [I]t makes me and my family and everyone else that I know that is Asian super mad and upset that this is happening. [For example,] the subway attacks where there was a mother who got dragged down the stairs for absolutely no reason. It just kind of makes you scared because you are Asian, and I would tell my mom, \u2018You\u2019re not going anywhere without me.\u2019 We got pepper spray and all of that. But there is definitely a difference because you just feel a connection with them no matter if you don\u2019t know them.\u201d\n\u2013U.S.-born woman of Taiwanese origin in early 20s\n\u201c[A]s a result of the pandemic, I think we saw an increase in Asian hate in the media. I think that was one time where I realized as an Asian person, I felt a lot of pain. I felt a lot of fear, I felt a lot of anger and frustration for my community. \u2026 I think it was just at that specific moment when I saw the Asian hate, Asian hate crimes, and I realized, \u2018Oh, they\u2019re targeting my people.\u2019 I don\u2019t know how to explain it exactly. I never really referred to myself just plainly as an Asian American, but when I saw it in that media and I saw people who looked like me or people who I related with getting hurt and mistreated, I felt anger for that community, for my community.\u201d\u201d\n\u2013U.S.-born woman of Korean origin in late teens\nSome connected discrimination during the pandemic to other times of heightened anti-Asian discrimination. For example, one woman connected anti-Asian discrimination during COVID-19 to the period after Sept. 11:\n\u201c[T]he hate crimes I\u2019m reading about now are towards Chinese [people] because of COVID, but I remember after 9/11, that was \u2013 I remember the looks that people would give me on the subway but also reading the violent acts committed towards Indians of all types, just the confusion \u2013 I mean, I say confusion but I mean really they wanted to attack Muslims, but they didn\u2019t care, they were just looking for a brown person to attack. So there\u2019s always something that happens that then suddenly falls on one community or another.\u201d\n\u2013U.S.-born man of Indian origin in late 40s"

      "text": "Last updated: August 2, 2023\nPerson\nVincent Chin\nVincent Chin was a Chinese American draftsman who lived in Detroit, Michigan during the deindustrialization of the Midwest. On June 19, 1982, Chin was the victim of an anti-Asian hate crime. White autoworkers Ronald Ebens and Michael Nitz fatally beat him with a baseball bat. Vincent Chin\u2019s life and the legal struggle for justice that followed his murder inspired the development Pan-Asian American community organizing in Detroit.\nWhat are some actions you can take when encountering injustice?\nThe Life of Vincent Chin\nVincent Jen Chin was born on May 18, 1955 in Guangdong province in mainland China. He lived in an orphanage for the first few years of his life. He was adopted in 1961 by Bing Hing \u201cDavid\u201d Chin (C.W. Hing) and Lily Chin, a Chinese American couple living in Michigan. C.W. Hing was originally from Guangdong and served in the US Army during World War II. After the war, his wife immigrated from China to the United States through the 1945 War Brides Act. [1] The couple worked in Chinese laundromats in Detroit, spending long hours each day sorting and washing soiled clothes, and ironing and wrapping garments.\nChin and his family lived in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan. Until 1971, they lived in Highland Park, an enclave of Detroit, and eventually moved to the suburb Oak Park. Here, Chin graduated from Oak Park High School, eventually studying at the Control Data Institute, a technical vocational school, and Lawrence Technological University in Southfield, Michigan.\nAn only child to older parents, Vincent Chin spent much of his adulthood caring for his family by supporting them financially. Chin worked as an industrial draftsman at Efficient Engineering, an automotive supplier in Detroit, and was a waiter at Golden Star Restaurant in Fernadale, Michigan. He also went to night school for computer operations. Chin was engaged to his fianc\u00e9 and was set to be married on June 28, 1982.\nDetroit: Mecca of the Auto Industry\nSince Henry Ford invented the Model T in 1908, the city of Detroit has been known as the mecca of the automobile industry. [2] In addition to Ford, American automakers, such as Chrysler and General Motors, established plants near and around Detroit. For decades, the industry's success made Detroit a major industrial hub, generating jobs and income for the city and its residents. By 1950, Detroit\u2019s population had surged to 2 million people, making it the fifth largest city in the US. [3]\nDuring the 1950s, however, things began to change. Automakers decentralized away from Detroit and opened new plants in smaller towns and states with lower wages. New Ford plants emerged 10 miles out in suburban Madison Heights and Plymouth, and as far as thirty miles northwest of Detroit in Wixom. Other plants left the state altogether to set up shop in Lima, Ohio, Buffalo, New York, and Richmond, California. In Detroit, automated machines began to replace workers on the assembly line. Although the auto industry continued to make record profits through the mid-1960s, more than 130,000 manufacturing jobs disappeared between 1948 and 1967. [4]\nBy the 1970s, the international oil crisis intensified the struggles of American autoworkers. Many American-made cars had a heavy, eight-cylinder engine and used a lot of gas. Although these models were popular at mid-century, they became increasingly unprofitable. As oil and gas prices skyrocketed, American drivers looked to foreign automakers for lighter and less expensive options. Fuel-efficient models from Germany and Japan (such as the Volkswagen Beetle and Rabbit, Datsun B-210, and Toyota Corolla) were not only cheaper to buy, but also to maintain and repair.[5]\nAs demand for American cars plummeted, massive layoffs swept through the industrial Midwest. According to the Associated Press, almost 190,000 assembly line workers had lost their jobs at General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler by the end of 1980. Based on census data, this was equivalent to over 9% of the entire labor force for the Detroit metro area and over 39% of the labor force for the central city alone. [6] As people struggled financially, their desperation turned to anger. They looked for someone to blame.\nAnti-Japanese Sentiment in Detroit\nMany American motor executives, politicians, unions, and autoworkers took out their frustration against anything and anyone they thought could be Japanese. Although German cars were just as popular and cost-effective, these groups played up the ethnic differences of Japanese and Japanese Americans. The animosity also extended to other Asian Americans who were lumped together as \u201cperpetual foreigners.\u201d As Chinese American activist and journalist Helen Zia explains, \u201cracism only works when people can be portrayed as different.\u201d[5] The scapegoating of Japanese Americans for the US\u2019s economic turmoil was only one incident in a long pattern of anti-Asian prejudice. Other incidents included the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, Japanese incarceration during World War II, and laws that prohibited Asian Americans from mixed race marriage, property ownership, providing testimony in court, and voting.\nIn 1965, changes in US immigration policy opened doors for immigrants from Asia and the Pacific Islands.[7] Asian American communities steadily grew around the country. By 1980, Asian Americans made up less than 1 percent of Detroit\u2019s total population (1.2 million people). African Americans made up more than 60% of the city\u2019s population, while white residents numbered over 30%. [8]\nAnti-Japanese sentiment and intimidation took many forms. The pervasive use of racialized language and offensive slurs signaled a dangerous environment for anyone who even \u201clooked\u201d Japanese. Politicians and broadcasts on television and radio all perpetuated the idea that buying or driving Japanese cars was \u201cun-American.\u201d They also invoked World War II-era rhetoric that depicted Japan as \u201cthe enemy.\u201d Some even turned to violence. For instance, union leaders, including from the United Auto Workers, encouraged autoworkers to vandalize Japanese cars and target the people driving them.[9]\nKilling of Vincent Chin and Circumstances of His Death\nOn June 19, 1982, Vincent Chin was hosting his bachelor party at the Fancy Pants Club in Highland Park, Michigan with a few of his friends. Two white autoworkers, Ronald Ebens and his stepson Michael Nitz, entered the bar and began to target Chin because of his Asian heritage. Ebens was a foreman at the local Chrysler plant. Nitz had recently been laid off from the plant and was working at a furniture store. They called Chin racial slurs, swore at him, and accused him (and other Asian Americans) of taking jobs from white autoworkers. When Chin stood up to confront them, a fight broke out. Both groups were thrown out of the bar.\nWhen Ebens went to his car for a baseball bat, Chin ran. Ebens and Nitz chased him but were unable to keep up. They returned to the parking lot where Chin\u2019s friends were still standing. They started to pursue Chin\u2019s Chinese Canadian friend Jimmy but ignored the white members of the group. Unable to catch either Chin or his friend on foot, Ebens and Nitz continued their pursuit by car for the next half hour. A local man testified that they had offered him $20 to help \u201cget the Chinese.\u201d [10]\nEbens and Nitz eventually identified Chin and his friend outside a McDonald\u2019s on Woodward Avenue. Nitz grabbed Chin from behind so that Ebens could beat Chin\u2019s arms, legs, and body with the baseball bat. Ebens finally delivered crushing blows to Chin\u2019s skull. There were several witnesses to the attack, including two off-duty police officers who ordered Ebens to stop at gunpoint.\nVincent Chin was rushed to Henry Ford Hospital. [11] Surgeons operated on his head overnight before placing him on life support. After four days, Chin\u2019s mother and fianc\u00e9e agreed to take Chin off life support. He died on June 23, 1982. He was 27. His 400 wedding guests attended his funeral. He was interred in Detroit\u2019s Forest Lawn Cemetery.\nLocal Organizing\nChin\u2019s murderers, Ebens and Nitz, were initially charged with second-degree murder. Although both men pled guilty to manslaughter, neither served a full day in jail. Judge Charles Kaufman sentenced them to three years probation, a $3,000 fine, and court costs. Kaufman later explained: \u201cThese aren\u2019t the kind of men you send to jail.\u201d[12]\nIn the 1980s, the Detroit Asian American community was small and fragmented, with ethnic groups staying mostly to themselves. Many in the community held a \u201cdon\u2019t make waves\u201d attitude, citing fears that protest would lead to more difficulties within a tense racially divided environment. There were also few protections for any outspoken individuals or those who wished to protest, since there were no Asian American advocacy groups or watch-dog organizations in Detroit.\nHowever, this changed on March 18, 1983, nine months after Vincent Chin\u2019s death. The lenient sentencing of Chin\u2019s attackers incensed communities of Asian descent, especially Vincent Chin\u2019s mother, Lily Chin. She appealed the decision of her son\u2019s case to the Chinese Welfare Council of Detroit, the civic arm of the Chinatown business community. She wrote: \u201cThis injustice is a terrible extreme. My son\u2019s blood had been shed; how injust could this be? I grieve in my heart and shed tears of blood. Yes, my son cannot be brought back \u2013 and I can only wait for death.\u201d[13]\nOn March 31, 1983, over 100 individuals and representatives of Asian organizations from the greater Detroit area gathered in the Detroit Chinese Welfare Council\u2019s meeting hall in Detroit\u2019s Chinatown. The audience was diverse and captured Asians from a range of age groups, political affiliations, occupations, and ethnicities. Members from twenty-some organizations signed on to build a grassroots coalition that advocated for all Americans, not just for one ethnic group. [14] This coalition was named American Citizens for Justice (ACJ), and marked the \u201cfirst explicitly Asian American grassroots advocacy effort with a national scope\u201d and expanded to include non-Asian advocates as well. [15]\nIn the months that followed, ACJ gathered donations and volunteers to mobilize for justice for Vincent Chin. From gaining legal counsel to collaborating with civil rights organizations in Detroit, like the Detroit Area Black Organizations and the United Auto Workers Union Community Action program, the ACJ campaigned for Chin\u2019s case. On May 9, 1983, the ACJ organized a large demonstration at Kennedy Square in Detroit that illustrated the broad, public outcry.\nLegal Battles\nLily Chin and ACJ advocates visited Washington, DC to meet with the US Department of Justice Civil Rights division to discuss federal civil rights prosecution against Ebens and Nitz. The mass mobilization and the ACJ\u2019s legal efforts led the US Department of Justice and FBI to initiate an investigation into the murder of Vincent Chin. In 1983, a federal grand jury found Ebens guilty of violating Chin\u2019s civil rights because the attack was racially motivated. [16] He was sentenced to 25 years in prison.\nEbens appealed this verdict, claiming that he could not get a fair trial due to the publicity surrounding the case in Detroit. His lawyers filed a successful relocation motion and the appeal took place in Cincinnati in 1987. [17] Circuit Judges Engel, Kennedy, and Milburn acquitted Ebens of the civil rights violation. Their decision only further galvanized activists to expose the discrimination and racism that Asian Americans experience.\nAfter Ebens was acquitted, Lily Chin successfully pursued a civil lawsuit for the \u201cvalue\u201d of her son\u2019s life. The judge ordered Ebens to pay $1.5 million and Nitz to pay $50,000 to Chin\u2019s estate. Although Nitz completed the payment, Ebens refused. Because no payments have been made, interest has increased the amount owed. [18]\nMovement Building\nThe ACJ\u2019s grassroots organization turned into a national movement for justice for Vincent Chin. Supporters organized demonstrations and mobilizations in major American cities and new Asian American advocacy groups formed across the nation. Furthermore, the ACJ worked towards building solidarity with different racial and ethnic groups in Detroit, including prominent African American churches, Arab Americans of Michigan, women\u2019s groups, Christian and Jewish organizations, and local political leaders.\nBut coalition building across race and ethnicity was not without its challenges. In Detroit, racial biases against Japanese Americans and Asian Americans fostered resentment about Vincent Chin\u2019s case. When ACJ representatives approached the United Auto Workers Union headquarters at Solidarity House in Detroit, they found anti-Japanese and anti-Asian stickers signs and bumper stickers that read \u201c300,000 Laid Off Autoworkers say Park Your Import in Tokyo.\u201d[19]\nThe ACJ also encountered resistance within white, European American and even Asian American communities, especially when it came to the issue of race. Pursuing a civil rights lawsuit for a racially motivated hate crime required the ACJ to talk explicitly about race. While some Asian Americans had become outspoken advocates for pan-Asian solidarity, others were concerned about speaking out about race and racism. During the early 1980s, dialogue about race had primarily focused on a Black-white divide. Where Asian Americans fell into the discussion was unclear.\nTalking heads on both sides of the political spectrum exacerbated these concerns. White conservatives called into radio talk shows, angered by the mention of racism surrounding the legal battles. White liberals, like Robert Sedler, a constitutional law professor at Wayne State University, dismissed Chin\u2019s case altogether. He expressed that civil rights were only for African Americans and not Asians, who he thought were \u201cwhite.\u201d [20]\nDespite these challenges, the ACJ led national movement for the justice for Vincent Chin, and set the stage for pan-Asian organizing in Detroit and beyond.\nContinuing Legacy\nAlthough Vincent Chin\u2019s life was cut short at age 27, he left an immense impact within Asian American communities locally and nationwide. His death and the court proceedings that followed are considered critical turning points for Asian American civil rights engagement. Within local and nationwide organizing, concerned community members and civil rights advocacy groups rallied for stronger federal hate crime legislation that protected Asian Americans. The public outcry to Vincent Chin\u2019s murder contributed to the formation of Pan-Asian American identity and unity.\nVincent Chin is commemorated through memorials, advocacy groups, and educational resources. In 2010, the city of Ferndale, Michigan erected a marker at the intersection of Woodward Avenue and 9 Mile Road to commemorate Vincent Chin\u2019s killing and the struggle for justice that followed. In 2023, the Vincent Chin Institute was established with the goal of \u201cuniting [Asian Pacific American] organizers to fight Anti-Asian Hate\u201d due to the resurgence of anti-Asian hate crimes during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023, the Institute published the second edition of The Vincent Chin Legacy Guide, authored by Helen Zia.\nConsider this:\nHow can you motivate other people to join a cause you care about?\nWhat does it take to build a movement?\nThis article was researched and written by Marjorie Justine Antonio, ACE Intern, and Jade Ryerson, NCPH Consulting Historian, with the Cultural Resources Office of Interpretation and Education.\nNotes\n[1] In 1945, the War Brides Act facilitated the reunification of couples and families. The Act and its amendments granted entry to the foreign-born wives and fianc\u00e9es of American soldiers within a set period. Additionally, Chinese wives would not count toward the annual quota.

      "text": "1982 killing of Vincent Chin in Detroit inspires decades of Asian American activism nationwide\nTwo white autoworkers bludgeoned 27-year-old Chinese American Vincent Chin to death with a baseball bat during his bachelor party in Detroit in 1982, but his loved ones' cries for justice fell on deaf ears.\nTwelve days passed before any media outlets reported Chin's killing by men who blamed Asian manufacturers for the downfall of the city's mainstay auto industry, and none acknowledged the racism in his killing at the time. The defendants pleaded guilty to manslaughter and were sentenced to three years' probation. Circuit Judge Charles Kaufman reasoned, \"These aren't the kind of men you send to jail.\"\nThe injustice spurred Asian Americans to unite across ethnic and cultural lines. Hundreds protested the trial's outcome in downtown Detroit. Chin's mother traveled the country sharing his story and pushing for a federal civil rights prosecution.\nMore than four decades later, activists still fight to ensure Chin is not forgotten, saying his story inspires advocacy nationwide. Law students reenact his trial, Hollywood adapted his story into a movie and Asian Americans remember the impact of his killing on their struggle for racial justice and equality.\n\"For a whole generation of Asian American activists, the Vincent Chin case was the case that got them involved,\" says writer and filmmaker Curtis Chin. \"It was the thing that brought them to the table.\"\nAfter the judge spared Vincent Chin's killers, Curtis Chin \u2014 then 14 \u2014 grabbed his parents' typewriter and wrote outraged letters to newspaper editors. He had found his calling.\nInstead of taking over his family's Chinese restaurant, Curtis Chin \u2014 who is not related to the man killed on June 23, 1982 \u2014 spent the next 30 years elevating Asian American voices, and recounting Vincent Chin's story and the racism of 1980s Detroit.\nFor Helen Zia, an Asian American activist who moved to Detroit in the 1970s, Chin's case laid bare the glaring injustices that her community faced.\nLacking any local organizations to advocate for Asian American civil rights, Zia co-founded the American Citizens for Justice, which helped to secure a federal trial against Chin's killers. One was acquitted of civil rights violations and the other was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison. His conviction was overturned on appeal.\nOn June 20, the FBI released a 602-page file on Chin's death, revealing previously unseen witness interviews with descriptions of his final moments and the anti-Asian slurs his attackers used, among other details.\nLast year, Zia launched the Vincent Chin Institute, an advocacy organization to counter hatred against Asian Americans.\nChin's case has had an impact beyond advocacy. Students at Harvard Law School have reenacted the trials of his attackers to highlight shortcomings in the legal system. And his killing has inspired documentaries, a podcast and a movie, \"Who Killed Vincent Chin?\"\nVincent Chin was a victim of brutal, racial violence, but from that tragedy emerged \"a chorus of Asian American voices,\" Curtis Chin says.\nThe autoworkers who attacked Chin blamed foreign vehicle manufacturers for hardships in the U.S. auto industry.\nThis fear of foreign economic threat parallels modern \"anti-China hysteria and scapegoating,\" says Stop AAPI Hate co-founder Cynthia Choi, pointing to attacks on Asians by people accusing them of culpability in the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\"What's different for our community today is that we are speaking out. We are speaking out loudly,\" Choi says.\nEstablished in 2020, Stop AAPI Hate advocates for policy change and collects comprehensive data on acts of hatred against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The group has documented thousands of cases nationwide, including verbal and physical abuse, and discrimination in business and education.\n\"Close to 50% of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders reported that they experienced some form of race-based hate in the past year,\" Choi says.\nAdvocates say there's still considerable work to be done.\n\"We don't even exist to most Americans,\" Zia says, citing lack of visibility as a key driver in the perpetuation of Asian American stereotypes.\nJohn Yang, the president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice - AAJC, underscores the damage of stereotypes.\n\"In terms of job opportunities, we are pigeonholed as perpetual foreigners,\" Yang says. \"Asian Americans don't get promoted at the same rate. We don't occupy C-suites. We don't occupy boards in the same way that other Americans do.\"\nDiscrimination also extends to housing. The Urban Institute, a think tank that conducts economic and policy research, reports that Asian American buyers are shown 18.8% fewer properties overall compared to white buyers. Yet the stereotype of Asian Americans as the model minority leads some fair housing advocates to exclude Asian Americans from their efforts.\n\"Everyone is concerned about whether an Asian American is truly an American, and so they're not being shown the same houses,\" Yang says. \"They're not being afforded the same opportunities.\"\nOn Sunday, dozens of residents stood with their heads bowed beneath Boston's Chinatown gate to remember Chin. Wearing T-shirts reading \"STOP ASIAN HATE,\" they arranged candles in the shape of a heart and displayed a portrait of Chin with his name written in Chinese and \"May 18, 1955 - June 23, 1982.\"\nWilson Lee, co-founder of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance Boston Lodge and the Chinese American Heritage Foundation, said he and his wife have organized a vigil for Chin every June 23 for six years. Even as media attention faded, their dedication to Chin's memory has not wavered.\n\"We're in it for the long haul,\" Lee says. \"Because it's the right thing to do, not because it's the popular thing to do.\"\nA collection of local dignitaries joined the remembrance, as did 16 Asian American elementary and high school students whom Lee described as \"stakeholders.\" They held orange lilies and yellow flowers pressed to their chests.\n\"We need to make sure that future generations, especially our young people, know about the experience that he went through,\" Lee says. \"They are standing on the shoulders of giants, and Vincent Chin was a giant.\""
