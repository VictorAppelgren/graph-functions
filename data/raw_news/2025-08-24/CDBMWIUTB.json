  "content": "Do You Owe More Than Your Car's Resale Value? What To Know Before Accepting A Trade-In Offer\n\nBeing upside-down is generally never a good thing. In the case of a car loan, it means you owe more than the value of your ride. This situation isn't unusual if you financed with a high-interest loan. According to the U.S. Federal Reserve, in March 2024, the average new car loan had an interest rate of 6.43%, over 2% higher than three years earlier. The situation gets more grim if you purchased one of the worst car brands for depreciation. Electric vehicles, in particular, are notorious for plummeting resale values compared to cars with internal combustion engines. While starting fresh with a trade-in on a new car and a new loan may seem to be a way out of the situation, such a move can compound the problem. Unless you're dropping a large amount of cash to offset what you owe on the old car, all you're doing is rolling over the negative equity into new financing. The result is higher payments, a longer loan, or both. Trading in a car without understanding its resale value is a recipe for financial disaster. Rather than just listening to dealer promises, take the time to understand how negative equity works. From there, you can make a more informed decision about whether a trade makes sense for your situation.\n\nBesides adding to the balance of a new car loan, negative equity can influence your choices for a replacement vehicle. If a dealer knows you're upside down on a loan, they may focus on structuring a deal around a specific monthly payment rather than the best bottom-line price. Not only do you lose negotiating leverage, but you also have less flexibility with car selection, incentives, and interest rates. Rolling over negative equity into a new loan may also impact the financing terms for a new vehicle. Lenders are all about reducing their risk, so borrowing more than a car's value can result in higher interest rates or shorter loan lengths. This is especially an issue if your credit isn't strong. Another consideration when adding negative equity to a loan is what happens if the new car is totaled in an accident. In this situation, the insurance payout will be based on the market value of your most recently financed vehicle. Without extra-cost gap insurance, you'll be responsible for the shortfall.\n\nSteps to take before trading in an upside-down car If you've decided to trade in a car with negative equity, there are steps to take to protect your financial interests. Before setting foot into any dealership to look at a new car, get an idea of your current vehicle's value. Operations like CarMax and Carvana offer online appraisals and purchase offers. Reach out to multiple companies as pricing can vary significantly, but be sure to be honest about your car's condition so the offers are accurate. Local dealers may also be willing to buy your vehicle without you making a purchase. Next, when you're ready to look at new cars (including used vehicles), focus on what you're buying, not what you're trading in. If asked if you're trading in your vehicle, just reply with a simple \"no.\" You can always change your mind. The whole point of this approach is to simplify negotiations and get to the best possible price. Once you're happy with the deal, you can bring up your trade-in, and don't hesitate to shop with competing dealers. Because you've already done the homework by getting third-party purchase offers, you'll know the trade-in's value. You may still be upside down, but you'll have minimized the negative equity as much as possible. If you proceed with a deal, confirm in writing when the old loan will be paid off and for what amount. There are other ways to avoid or reduce negative equity. For instance, selling your car privately may yield a higher price. And, yes, you can sell a car that hasn't been paid off. You can also postpone your purchase decision and make extra payments on the current car to pay down the loan more quickly.",

      "text": "What Does It Mean If A Car Is Totaled & What Happens If It's Still Drivable?\nSo, you've gotten into a terrible accident. Like the responsible person that you are, you filed a claim with your insurance company, and have been patiently waiting for their estimate. How many of you have spent those days or weeks in utter panic, hoping that your insurance company will cover the damages and get you back out onto the road? How many more of you have finally heard back, only to find out that you are now faced with every driver's worst nightmare? Your car is totaled. It is a phrase that strikes as much fear into drivers as it does their insurers. But what does it mean?\nThe term has become such a mainstay in common parlance that few drivers know what it signifies, let alone what options exist for them after they've received the dreaded news. Instead, their first thought is probably of tabloids showcasing celebrities' crumpled luxury cars. But it is important to know that not all is lost when you find out your car is totaled, and several options exist for those hoping to escape from the harrowing experience.\nTotally done for\nThe term \"totaled,\" broadly speaking, is applied to any car whose repair costs outweigh its actual cash value (ACV). This isn't as straightforward as it seems, however, as individual states require different thresholds for considering a vehicle a \"total loss.\" As it currently stands, just over half of U.S. states define the threshold for a total loss as below the car's ACV, some even setting it as low as 60%. In practice, this means that in states like Louisiana or Michigan, where the threshold is 75%, a car with an ACV of $10,000 only needs to have $7,500 worth of damage to be considered totaled.\nOther states, like California, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, utilize a \"Total Loss Formula\" (TLF). A TLF essentially compares the cash value of the vehicle to the combined total of its repair costs and salvage value \u2014 i.e. your car's current sale value, as is. These calculations can be tricky with newer models, as the price of repairing new cars has disproportionately increased over the years.\nOn top of these thresholds, some states have additional stipulations for determining if a car is totaled. Georgia, for instance, defines any car in need of two major component replacements as a total loss. Another important factor can be the type of damage inflicted, rather than the costs. For example, many states consider flooded cars to be totaled regardless of the financial costs of repairs. This is especially true for electric vehicles, as their internal systems are particularly susceptible to flood damage.\nYour car is totaled, what happens next?\nAfter you've established that your car is totaled, what happens next largely depends on your insurance coverage and the level of damage you've incurred. More than likely, your insurance company will reimburse you for the ACV of the vehicle, minus your deductible. If the damage is determined to be another driver's fault, that process will more than likely go through their property damage liability coverage. This often requires the extra step of proving your lack of fault in the accident, and may delay your ACV payout.\nWith that being said, you may be lucky enough to have an insurance company that will cover the ACV in the meantime, so always double-check what options are available to you. Be aware, however, that many states employ no-fault auto insurance laws, which will require you to file your claim through your own insurance no matter your level of culpability.\nIn most cases, your insurer will take possession of the damaged vehicle. For these instances, it is important to note that your insurer's claim of the vehicle does not exempt you from paying off your car loan or lease. For example, if you owe $10,000 and the ACV is determined to be $9,000, you are still liable to pay the $1,000 gap out of pocket. To protect against this, drivers can obtain gap or loan/lease payoff coverage, which will cover the remaining balance.\nBut what happens if your insurance company does not possess the car after its designation? Is there a way to get your totaled car back on the road?\nSalvage titles, and determining if your car is unfixable\nSometimes when an insurance company rules a car is totaled, they will provide the owner with a new title. While there are several types of car titles to be aware of, one of the most common in this instance is a salvage title. A salvage title indicates that the insurer will not possess the damaged car after it pays the claim. Usually, this means the car possesses little financial value, i.e. the insurance company has deemed that it is not worth repairing, reselling, or salvaging for parts. In that case, the owner will receive a salvage title and remain the owner of the damaged vehicle.\nA salvage title does not mean that the car is worthless, however. Oftentimes, the owner will receive a title for an array of special circumstances, such as if the car was vandalized, parts were stolen, or if the car previously served as a taxi or a police vehicle. Even if the salvage title is purely damage-related, it doesn't signify that the car cannot be fixed.\nSo what should you do if you receive a salvage title, especially if your car is still drivable?\nSaving the unsalvageable: What happens if my car is still drivable?\nGetting a salvage title vehicle back onto the road can be a difficult process. That doesn't mean it's impossible, however, and can be a great option for those who don't mind expending a little elbow grease. As with most projects, information is your best friend. The first step in salvaging your car should always be learning exactly why it received a salvage title \u2014 and what it needs to become street-legal. Next, seek out a professional to help you meet your state's safety standards. Whether they fully restore your vehicle, or merely double-check your own repairs, enlisting a professional can ensure critical safety issues don't go unnoticed. It may also save you a major headache down the line.\nOnce refurbished, you'll need to insure the vehicle. Although more difficult, drivers of salvaged cars can still find an insurance plan that won't break the bank. The first step is to upgrade your salvaged title; a process that usually requires a series of safety inspections. After your car is street-certified, you'll need to shop around for an insurer. While some companies are hesitant to insure salvaged cars, most drivers can expect to be covered for liability insurance, or the damage caused to another vehicle in an accident, personal injury protection, and uninsured motorist protection.\nOnce your car is repaired, certified, and insured, you are finally ready to hit the road again."

      "text": "Can You Sell A Car That Hasn't Been Paid Off Yet?\nWhether you need to move on from an unreliable car or want to drive a vehicle with the latest technology, selling your automobile \u2014 even if it's not paid off \u2014 is possible. Freeing yourself from this obligation can be a no-brainer or a bit complicated, depending on how you sell the vehicle and financial factors. Car loans are common. According to the Federal Reserve, 80% of new and 38% of used cars are financed. Let's go over some auto financing essentials before diving into the details of selling a car with an existing loan.\nThe term \"paid off\" refers to a car loan (or any loan, for that matter) where the borrower has met their responsibility and paid the loan balance, either through monthly payments or a lump sum amount. The lender holds the title and is listed as the lienholder, which gives them legal control over the vehicle until the loan is paid off \u2014 even though you possess and use the car. The title is a state-issued document designating who owns the vehicle and is at the heart of the selling process, especially if there's still an outstanding loan.\nYou can sell a car through a dealer or a private party transaction. Both methods are possible if there's an existing loan balance, but each approach varies in complexity and the steps you'll need to take. We'll cover how each process works and the pros and cons. Regardless of the method, contact the lender to determine how much you owe on the loan. This is called a payoff quote \u2014 which can change daily \u2014 and is essential for selling a car. Some finance companies will provide a payoff amount that's good for a specific period, often 10 days. You may need a new payoff quote if the time has passed.\nSelling to a dealer: the fastest and simplest route\nConvenience comes at a price, especially when selling a car. Regardless of whether a local dealer is buying or if you're working through CarMax or Carvana, selling a vehicle in this manner is straightforward, especially if there's a balance on the car loan. The trade-off is you'll usually get less for your car this way than selling privately. Nonetheless, some vehicle owners want to offload their rides without the hassle of Facebook Marketplace, tire kickers, or confusing paperwork. Dealers exist for a reason.\nThese businesses work directly with finance companies to buy cars with existing loan balances \u2014 a regular part of their operations. They'll evaluate your vehicle, in-person or online, and make an offer. Should you proceed, the dealer will confirm the payoff amount with the bank and handle all the paperwork. You'll get paid the difference if the car is worth more than the payoff amount. If you owe more than what the dealer is offering \u2014 which is called negative equity \u2014 you're responsible for paying the rest. Importantly, the finance company won't sign over the title to the dealer until it has all the money it's owed.\nSelling your car through a dealer couldn't be simpler. You'll sign a few forms and can walk away from your vehicle in short order (provided the financial details are taken care of). There's no waiting for the bank to send a lien release or heading to the DMV for a title transfer. While the dealer handles most of the process, it can still take a few business days for the lien to clear and the title to transfer, depending on your state and lender.\nSelling privately: better price, more complexity\nSelling your car privately is more likely to net a higher price than through a dealer. You'll just need to go through more steps, which is the biggest disadvantage, particularly if the loan hasn't been paid off. It's best to tell buyers the lender holds the vehicle title, and the sale proceeds will go toward paying off the loan. Scam concerns may turn some buyers off, but it prevents surprises. Talk with the bank and find out how long it will take to receive the title. Smaller financing companies may keep the title readily accessible, while larger operations will store the document at a central facility, requiring a week or two for the lien release.\nAssuming you've found a buyer willing to work through the loan payoff process, there are two ways to proceed. Meet at the lender's office, where the buyer will pay the bank directly. This might cover all or part of the payoff, depending on the sale price. The buyer pays you the difference if the purchase amount exceeds the loan balance. You'll pay the rest if the selling price is lower than the payoff. Signing over the title to the buyer may require additional time. Alternatively, you can use an online escrow service (like escrow.com or keysavvy.com), which involves back-and-forth mailings and digital payments. These services charge a small fee but provide peace of mind for both parties by holding funds securely until the transaction and title release are complete.\nOne workaround is taking out a personal loan to pay off the car loan, which clears the title. The proceeds of the private sale pay off the personal loan. You'll owe interest, but the advantages may be worth it. You'll still owe the personal loan if the buyer falls through."

      "text": "10 Of The Worst Car Brands For Depreciation\nThe long-term value of a car doesn't always equate to its price. Maintenance fees and problems from age can pile up, and even paint color affects resale value way more than you might think. Some vehicles wind up only being worth half of their original cost, within not that long of a time. Sometimes, you can predict how well your ride will keep its value based on its history from previous years. Many cars are especially valuable, no matter when they were released \u2014 some are so valuable they can improve the reputation of their overall brands.\nHowever, some brands are know for having poor long-term value overall. This includes many luxury brands that sell for absurdly high prices initially, as well as ones likely owned by the average consumer. This article will take a look at some of the worst car brands for depreciation (ranked in no particular order), based on their lowest-valued models after five years of use. While many brands might have stand-out vehicles, many of their popular choices might not even be worth reselling after just a couple of years.\nKia\nKia's Telluride is one of the best bets for a high-resale value SUV, with its depreciation hitting around 48% of its value after five years. Its other vehicles stack up decently as well, with the Soul's depreciation only amounting to 43% and the Sportage not even going above 40%. Its lowest-value vehicle is the Sorento, but even this keeps over half of its original price. At first glance, it doesn't seem like Kia should be listed among the worst brands for depreciation at all.\nThe problems come when you stack Kia up against other brands. While it lacks any truly bad models in terms of five-year value, it doesn't have many stand-out models in that regard, either. Jeep, Subaru, Honda, Toyota, and Mazda all manage to blow Kia out of the water with their greater retained value. Other brands might have lower lows, but they also have models with even less depreciation. Those vehicles might be more expensive at first, but you might end up losing less money with them than you would even with a Sportage.\nGMC\nGMC isn't a terrible brand on the used car market, but certain models represent some notable shortcomings. According to CarEdge, the Yukon XL will lose over half of its value within 5 years, which will lead to owners losing out on over $40,000 after that period of time. The regular-sized Yukon handles itself better with its depreciation at around 41%, but it's not ideal for an SUV that starts at over $66,000 today. Even without considering the GMC Yukon years you might want to avoid, avid resellers would likely prefer to avoid this model altogether.\nThankfully, other GMC models don't have nearly as much to worry about when it comes to depreciation. The Acadia still loses out on 50% of its value after 5 years, but its lower price point means you aren't losing nearly as much money. The Terrain stands out as well, priced at under $40,000 and only losing around 40% of that in the same timeframe. It might not be as large as the Yukon, but this smaller SUV will hold its value with much greater ease in the long run.\nChevrolet\nChevrolet is in a bit of an odd spot when it comes to depreciation. The Camaro could be a Chevrolet model with outstanding resale value...or one with terrible resale value \u2014 multiple sources offer contradicting estimates. Models like the Tahoe and Suburban also end up losing out on a lot of their original cost after a few years. These are also some particularly expensive vehicles, so their depreciation is a lot more harmful than it is to something like the Sorento.\nNot every model ends up in a bad spot, though. A Corvette might lose a lot of its original price after 5 years, but it's also consistently rated as a high-value vehicle. On average, these can hold around 65% of their original value, with coupe models keeping as much as over 70%. The Spark and Colorado are also decent choices for reselling later on, and the Silverado is one of the best trucks you can find at low depreciation percentages. Just be prepared to take a hefty blow to your wallet unless you go for the surprisingly-cheap Spark.\nAudi\nLuxury brands tend to have worse depreciation than more popular brands on average. Audi doesn't suffer as badly from this trend as other manufacturers, but its values are all over the place. The Q7, A8, SQ5, and A7 all tend to lose around half of their value after five years, with the A8 in particular taking a very heavy hit from its $100,000-plus price point. On the other hand, the Q3 is estimated to lose less than 40% of its value in that same amount of time, making it an especially worthwhile vehicle.\nAudi is a good example of the risks when looking at the secondhand market for both larger brands and luxury brands. With such a wide selection of models, you might not realize you've ended up with a far less valuable vehicle unless you research it meticulously. Meanwhile, the staggering prices of these high-end rides will lead to you missing out on the entire cost of a new low-end car no matter what. In fact, while the depreciation of some Audi models might seem like a real gut-punch to value seekers, it's actually one of the better luxury brands once you look at how expensive other options are.\nLand Rover\nUnlike Audi, Land Rover doesn't have a wide variety of models to choose from. Most of its vehicles are some different version of the Range Rover, which starts at over $107,000 for a modern model. You can cut this cost in half if you go for a lesser Evoque model, but event that will still likely lose over 50% of its value after a few years. The regular version is in an even worse spot, with its 5-year depreciation coming in at over 60% lost value \u2014 potentially enough to buy a new Evoque on its own.\nEven if you look to models other than the Range Rover and its variants, Land Rover still ends up with some poor value after a while. According to iSeeCars, the Discovery is slated to lose nearly 60% of its value after five years, and its Sport model only stays better by about 5% more. Even the Defender falls around this same threshold. Luckily, all of these models are much cheaper than the Range Rover, so their depreciation won't lead to a greater loss of money.\nFord\nFord shares a few of Chevrolet's quirks when it comes to resale value, particularly with different sources disagreeing on how much its vehicles depreciate over time. The F-150 can lose as little as 40% of its original cost after five years or as much as 50%, while the F-350's depreciation ranges from 36% to 21%. Ford is among the largest and oldest car manufacturers out there, so it makes sense that its resale value would have a lot of variance. You can avoid the models that perform terribly on the secondhand market, but you've got to do your research.\nThe luxury division of Ford also ends up with this variance. The MKZ is estimated to lose over 67% of its value while the Navigator loses 54%, and in the latter's case, this ends up becoming much more impactful when considering its MSRP. In just about every case, depreciation is going to hit vehicles priced at $100,000 harder than it ever will for those set at around $20,000. Not every Lincoln is as expensive as the Navigator, but their resale value still falls under 50% consistently, making them tough to sell for a decent price unless you've only owned one for a year or two.\nNissan\nPreviously, we've mentioned the Nissan Leaf as one of four used EVs with the best resale value. However, we've also reported on the Nissan Leaf's terrible resale value, because it only really manages to stack up well against EVs from more luxurious brands. Compared to cars driven by the average consumer, the Leaf falls uncomfortably short, with its depreciation ranging from 54% to 61% of its $30,000-plus original price. Other models from the brand lose out on a lot of value as well, with the Armada not even retaining half after the five-year mark.\nInterestingly, a few other Nissan models end up going above and beyond when avoiding depreciation. The Versa consistently keeps over 60% of its original value, while the Frontier is able to hold on to at least 59%. Conversely, the Ariya loses over 60% of its value in a similar time frame, putting it near the bottom of the barrel. It seems that there are few Nissans that hit closer to a middle ground when it comes to depreciation, with some keeping remarkably close to their MSRP while others plummet after a few short years.\nTesla\nWhile some might see a Tesla car as a status symbol, this only really applies if the model didn't have a previous owner already. After all, Tesla is a luxury brand, and very few of its vehicles have even made it past the five-year mark. Of the ones that managed to reach past that time frame, none of them were reported to keep their value above 50%, with the Model S ending up in the worst position as it can barely hold onto 40%. Only the Model 3 and Model Y manage to stay below $80,000 when new, with the depreciation of other models often exceeding their MSRP.\nTesla only makes electric vehicles with various \"smart\" features, so it only makes sense that the value of older models would continue to plummet as hardware capabilities improve. Additionally, Tesla has set strict Cybertruck resale rules on the earliest buyers, making it just about impossible to even judge its retained value up until the end of 2024. It's not the only brand to make these sorts of restrictions, but with only a handful of models available, it ends up putting the resale value of other cars in its lineup into perspective.\nMercedes-Benz\nMercedes-Benz falls into the same trappings that other luxury brands end up in. Even the model with the highest resale value \u2014 the AMG GT, at over 55% \u2014 ends up with its MSRP over $130,000, leading to an absolutely crippling blow in a reseller's finances. It only gets worse as you go further down, with the S-Class dropping to around 35-40% while still boasting a price around $70,000-$80,000. There are a lot of extremely expensive Mercedes-Benz vehicles, and after 5 years, just about all of them will lose out on a lot of that initial pricing.\nFor the \"cheaper\" Mercedes-Benz models, things get a bit more reasonable. The Sprinter is still a relatively expensive vehicle that loses half of its value pretty quickly, but its initial cost of under $70,000 does at least lessen those downsides. This also goes for models like the EQB, which will set you back around $53,000 when new. It might lose out on over 60% of its value after five years, but that's less money than what the GLS-Class loses out on in just two.\nBMW\nBMW ends up on this list almost solely due to its 7 Series and 5 Series models. Across multiple sources, these are consistently among the worst-valued cars after five years, losing as much as over 70% of their original value over that period. For the 7 Series in particular, the initial price of over $100,000 only worsens that depreciation, easily rivaling Mercedes-Benz when it comes to how much money is lost over time. Models like the i7 and iX are in similar positions, sharing that greater-than-70% value drop-off which amounts to a loss of over $60,000-$80,000.\nEven with these remarkably poor results, there are still some perfectly fine BMW models out there. The Z4, for example, ends up being one of the best-value luxury cars out there, keeping its overall depreciation under half while also having a more reasonable original price of a little over $50,000. It's definitely far from ideal, but it's also far from the worst examples of lessened value on this list. Despite being one of the worst brands for depreciation, that doesn't mean BMW is completely out of the question for resales."
