  "content": "President Trump\u2019s superpower has always been his ability to read the cultural zeitgeist and meet the moment with commonsense solutions.\n\nThe Wollman ice-skating rink was opened in 1949 in New York City\u2019s iconic Central Park. It was featured in several Hollywood blockbusters and drew tourists worldwide. However, the beloved rink was closed in 1980 after city officials failed to maintain it, and it fell into disrepair.\n\nMayor Ed Koch promised to reopen it by 1985, but a year later, the project was nowhere near completion and was running $12 million over its $4.7 million budget.\n\nMr. Trump was no fan of Mr. Koch\u2019s, to say the least. Frustrated with the rink\u2019s lack of progress, Mr. Trump offered to step in and manage the project, promising to complete the effort before Christmas 1986.\n\n\u201cIf Koch doesn\u2019t like this offer, then let him have the same people who have built it for the last six years do it for the next six years,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the time of the incompetent contractors and city officials tasked with the rink\u2019s reopening.\n\nMr. Koch agreed, and Mr. Trump, with his contracting team, had the rink opened by Nov. 1, 1986, delivering a major win to the city\u2019s residents and visitors. From a cultural perspective, the victory may have meant more to New Yorkers battling high crime rates and urban decay at the time than any skyscraper he built.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s can-do attitude \u2014 the belief that proficient, qualified and skilled outsiders can always best a slow, lazy and corrupt government \u2014 propelled him into the White House in 2016 and then again in 2024.\n\nIt has Democrats \u201cstuck,\u201d as Mr. Trump said Wednesday. He touted his efforts to fight crime in the nation\u2019s capital and beautify it, including refurbishing the Kennedy Center, the city\u2019s parks and the Federal Reserve building.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost a waste of time to meet [with Democrats] because they never approve anything. If we want money to fight crime, if we want money to do only good things, just good things. Let\u2019s not even talk about controversial. They don\u2019t want to meet about anything. They really are \u2014 they\u2019re stuck,\u201d Mr. Trump said when announcing the celebrities to be honored this year at the Kennedy Center.\n\nHe continued: \u201cThe Democrats are afraid to do anything because they don\u2019t want to be criticized, but fighting crime is a good thing. We have to explain. We\u2019re going to fight crime.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing. Already, they\u2019re saying, \u2018He\u2019s a dictator. The place is going to hell, and we\u2019ve got to stop it.\u2019 So instead of saying, \u2018He\u2019s a dictator,\u2019 they should say, \u2018We\u2019re going to join him and make Washington safe.\u2019 But they say, \u2018He\u2019s a dictator.\u2019 And then they end up getting mugged.\u201d\n\nDemocrats widely criticized Mr. Trump for mobilizing the National Guard to patrol the streets of the District of Columbia. They downplayed crime in the nation\u2019s capital and argued it was safe.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s federal takeover of D.C. isn\u2019t about safety, it\u2019s about distracting Americans from high prices, a bad jobs report, a falling economy, and the Epstein files,\u201d Rep. Eric Swalwell, California Democrat, wrote on \u201cX\u201d on Monday. He attached an article claiming crime in the District was declining from pandemic-era spikes.\n\nMr. Swalwell wrote on X last year that he and his wife had practiced \u201cgoing out through the back seat to get our kids if we are carjacked. This is not normal.\u201d\n\nRep. Henry Cuellar, Texas Democrat, was carjacked at gunpoint near his D.C. home. Rep. Angie Craig, Minnesota Democrat, was assaulted in the elevator of her D.C. apartment building. Then there\u2019s Naomi Biden, President Biden\u2019s granddaughter, whose Secret Service detail had to open fire in Georgetown last year as three teenagers tried to break into their unmarked vehicle.\n\nDemocrats seem incapable of recognizing the reality right before them, let alone working with Mr. Trump to address it, all because they must stand in opposition to him, even if it\u2019s to their detriment, against the desires of everyday Americans.\n\nMr. Trump is not only trying to deliver safety and beauty to the District but his administration has also achieved no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime, and the ability for Americans to deduct interest payments on new cars, a major win for the working class that not one Democrat voted for.\n\nMr. Trump shut down the southern border without a single Democratic vote. He has advocated for women by keeping biological men out of women\u2019s athletics, a bill that Senate Democrats blocked from advancing earlier this year.\n\n\u201cYou know, they talk about 80/20, 80/20 issues. But I think many of those 80/20 issues, like men and women sports, I think it\u2019s 97 to 3, not 80/20. And I think crime is maybe 100 to nothing,\u201d said Mr. Trump, speaking of the support of policies he is championing that Democrats oppose.\n\n\u201c[Democrats] don\u2019t approve anything. It\u2019s amazing. It\u2019s like they just don\u2019t want to vote for anything,\u201d Mr. Trump ruminated Wednesday.\n\nHe continued: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that anybody is capable of making a deal with these people. They have gone crazy.\u201d\n\nSo Mr. Trump and Republicans are going it alone and, just like with the Wollman Rink in New York City, delivering to the American people in their fight against inept government bureaucracy.\n\u2022 Kelly Sadler is the commentary editor at The Washington Times.",
