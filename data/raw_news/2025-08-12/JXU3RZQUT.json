  "title": "Inside Nvidia And AMD\u2019s $3 Billion Export \u201cTax\u201d Deal With Trump",
  "description": "This article discusses the basics surrounding the new export trade deal for Nvidia and AMD with Trump and the consequences of the deal for the two companies and beyond.",
  "content": "Two of the largest companies in the world, Nvidia and AMD, have agreed to pay the U.S. 15% of their revenues from sales of chips and semiconductors to China. This agreement can be viewed as a win-win for technology conglomerates and the U.S. government, as it enables Nvidia and AMD to expand their market share for their products while allowing the U.S. to collect upwards of $3 billion more in incremental revenue from export activities. This novel type of revenue collection is not a tax, as commonly defined. However, it does appear to be a form of an export tax, and its framework presents a potential new opportunity for the Trump administration to raise additional revenues that it would otherwise not have previously collected. This article discusses the basics surrounding this novel new export trade deal for Nvidia and AMD with Trump and the direct and indirect consequences of such a deal for the two companies and beyond.\n\nNvidia and AMD are currently two of the largest companies in the world, ranking 31st and 167th on the Fortune 500 list, respectively. Importantly, they are among the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of computer chips, which have become increasingly important and valuable as these products now appear in numerous devices, from obvious items like computers and smartphones to less obvious items like vehicles and appliances. Furthermore, the use of proprietary technology has become an even more strategic asset as the world has entered the artificial intelligence boom, which relies heavily on advanced processing chips.\n\nNvidia and AMD are among the two most significant manufacturers of these chips, which help enable the use of advanced computing. This technology achievement has been accomplished by securing a significant market share of the Graphics Processing Unit market and playing a pivotal role in enhancing processing power to advance and adapt to artificial intelligence, according to TechSpot.\n\nWhile this technology is valuable, the U.S. limits companies\u2019 ability to sell these products to those outside the U.S., most notably, China. Although there are chip manufacturers outside the U.S., the quality of their products may not be the same, creating a natural demand for companies like Nvidia and AMD to expand their sales into these other countries.\n\nAs first reported by Financial Times, Nvidia and AMD have agreed to pay 15% of their revenues from semiconductor and chip sales to China in exchange for specific export licenses that allow the companies to move their products overseas. The specific deal pertains to Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips and AMD\u2019s MI308 chips. This announcement comes after Nvidia was hit with a ban in April for sending these same H20 chips to China. Yahoo!Finance reports that the prior ban cost the company billions in lost revenue, and the new deal will result in as much as $3 billion in incremental collections to the U.S. government.\n\nBillionaire Mark Cuban reacted to this agreement on X with the following statement:\n\nThis social media post comes as high praise to many, as Cuban has been a known and public skeptic of Trump, and Cuban calls out the vast majority of his strongest adversaries in congratulating the President on this unique trade agreement.\n\nWhile companies often face import and export fees, taxes, and tariffs when moving products across borders, this type of collection is unique in that technology companies have often been better equipped to utilize their intangible assets, enabling them to engage in profit shifting and cost-sharing agreements. As Cuban has exclaimed, the U.S. Government has long sought to tax many of these companies based on their income. However, this new export sales tax might revolutionize the nature and extent to which these companies pay their fair share of money to the U.S.\n\nThe Consequences Of Nvidia And AMD\u2019s Export Trade Deal\n\nWhile the agreement appears to be great news for many key participants, the stock prices of Nvidia and AMD both struggled following the news, according to Forbes. Part of the reason for the mixed reaction is that the 15% collection of revenues for these chips is high, and the tax incidence will potentially fall onto Chinese customers, meaning they will be paying substantially more for the same chips they bought earlier this year. Furthermore, as reported by CNN, it is unclear whether China will even want these chips, as they are not as advanced as the technology that Nvidia and AMD currently produce.\n\nHowever, the broader consequences of this deal are that it creates a framework for the Trump administration (and potentially future administrations) to tax specific types of goods produced by U.S. companies. Other electronic manufacturers, such as Apple and Microsoft, as well as non-electronics companies like DowDuPont and Amgen, export billions of dollars\u2019 worth of goods each year. Even arms manufacturers like Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon Technologies, and Northrop Grumman export significant quantities of weapons to allied countries. Like chips and semiconductors, the U.S. government closely monitors and potentially restricts the types and amounts of weapons sold to each country. Thus, given the new framework provided by Nvidia, AMD, and the Trump administration, these defense manufacturers can potentially now determine whether and to what extent they can expand their foreign sales, while also providing some incremental financial benefits to the U.S. government.\n\nBefore more companies can negotiate such a deal, the Trump administration will need to defend the legality of Nvidia and AMD\u2019s deal, as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle question whether this export tax can be allowed, according to Politico. Despite some of the pessimism and the possibility of legal challenges, the deal reflects ingenuity and thinking outside the box, and, should it be an actual win-win situation, many other companies will potentially line up to strike a similar deal with Trump.",

      "text": "In This Article:\nNvidia (NVDA) has cut an unprecedented deal with the Trump administration to save its China business that would entail sharing as much as $3 billion in revenue with the US government for the current fiscal year to resume sales of its H20 chips.\nPresident Trump confirmed in a press briefing Monday that he made an arrangement with Nvidia to grant the leading AI chipmaker export licenses for the chips in exchange for 15% of their revenues from China.\n\"We negotiated a little deal,\" Trump told a room of reporters, calling Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang \"a brilliant guy.\"\nMultiple media outlets reported over the weekend that Nvidia and rival Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) had made such deals with President Trump, citing unnamed sources, following an initial report of the news from the Financial Times. Trade policy experts cited by the Washington Post said the agreements amounted to blackmail and violated the US Constitution's ban on export taxes.\nNvidia did not confirm its new arrangement with the Trump administration, but a spokesperson told Yahoo Finance, \"We follow rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets. While we haven't shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.\"\nNvidia and AMD shares fell fractionally on Monday.\nChina is one of Nvidia's most important markets, accounting for 13% of the company's revenue in its prior fiscal year. Nvidia has repeatedly introduced new, lower-power chips to sell to China in the face of tightening US export controls, as the government has cited national security concerns. The chipmaker began sales of its H20 chips \u2014 graphics processing units based on its prior-generation Hopper architecture \u2014 in 2024.\nNvidia got hit with a surprise ban on exports of its H20 chips to China by the Trump administration in April, costing the company billions in lost sales and sending the stock spiraling. The ban was later reversed in July, drawing national security concerns from lawmakers worried about China's development of AI.\nWall Street analysts projected that Nvidia would recoup $15 billion in lost sales in the second half of the year after the ban was lifted, to hit about $20 billion in revenue from China for its fiscal year 2026, which ends next January \u2014 meaning the US government could get $3 billion from its deal with the company.\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said Nvidia making some revenue from China is better than none: \"At the end of the day we believe it is better to allow NVIDIA (and AMD) to sell AI into China, as failure to do so effectively hands the Chinese AI market over to Huawei, and encourages the coalescence of Chinese developers around Huawei's architecture and ecosystem (undesirable).\""

      "text": "Topline\nShares of Nvidia and AMD fell in premarket trading early on Monday, after reports said both companies have agreed to pay 15% of the revenue generated on AI chip sales to China to the U.S. government, as part of an unconventional deal with the Trump administration to secure export licenses.\nKey Facts\nAccording to the Financial Times, which first reported on the matter, Nvidia will pay the 15% cut on the revenue it generates from the sale of its H20 AI chips, a cut-down version of its H100 chip designed to comply with export rules on China.\nAMD has also agreed to pay a similar cut on the sales of its MI308 chip designed for China, the report added.\nCiting an unnamed U.S. official and others familiar with discussions, the FT report said the deal was a necessary condition for the China export licenses granted to the companies last week.\nIt is unclear if these 15% export levies will raise the price of these chips for Chinese buyers.\nIn premarket trading early on Monday morning, Nvidia\u2019s shares dropped 1.16% to $180.61, while AMD\u2019s slipped 2.3% to $168.79.\nU.S. government officials and AMD have not yet publicly commented on the matter, but an Nvidia spokesperson told various outlets that the company hasn\u2019t \u201cshipped H20 to China for months,\u201d but it hopes \u201cexport control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.\u201d\nHow Much Could The U.s. Government Earn From This Deal?\nIn May this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told the Stratechery Podcast that he estimates Nvidia could earn $15 billion from H20 chip sales to China. This means the U.S. government stands to earn as much as $2.25 billion from the AI chipmaking giant as part of this deal. In its Q2 2025 earnings call last week, AMD reported a $800 million write-off due to restrictions on the exports of its MI308 chips to China. If the company\u2019s China sales projections are accurate, the U.S. government could earn another $120 million.\nWhat Do We Know About U.s. Chip Export Controls For China?\nIn an SEC filing made in April, Nvidia disclosed that the Trump administration had placed additional restrictions on the exports of its H20 AI chips to \u201cChina (including Hong Kong and Macau),\u201d or to companies headquartered in the country. At the time, the company said the restrictions would result in a $5.5 billion hit in its first-quarter financial results. Last month, Huang met Trump at the White House, where he reportedly urged the president to allow his company to restart H20 sales to China, arguing that the export controls would weaken the U.S.\u2019s edge in artificial intelligence and semiconductors. A few days after the meeting, Nvidia announced that it plans to resume H20 sales in China after the U.S. government \u201cassured\u201d the company that the \u201clicenses will be granted.\u201d The Financial Times reported last week that the commerce department has started issuing the licenses to Nvidia, allowing it to export its cut-down AI chips to China.\nChief Critics\nLast month, a group of 20 national security experts and former government officials wrote to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, raising concerns about the export license approval. \u201cWe believe this move represents a strategic misstep that endangers the United States\u2019 economic and military edge in artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014an area increasingly seen as decisive in 21st-century global leadership,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThe decision to ban H20 exports earlier this year was the right one. We ask you to stand by that principle and continue blocking the sale of advanced AI chips to China as America works to maintain its technological edge. This is not a question of trade. It is a question of national security.\u201d The signatories of the letter included Matt Pottinger, who serves as the deputy national security adviser during Trump\u2019s first term, and Stewart Baker, who served as Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for Policy during the George W. Bush administration. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Sunday Pottinger and Liza Tobin, who served as the China director of the White House\u2019s National Security Council between 2019-21, wrote: \u201cThe controls on Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips appear to have been working until CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s lobbying secured a reversal that handed Beijing exactly what it wanted.\u201d On the 15% cut deal, Tobin told the New York Times: \u201cThis is the Trump playbook applied in exactly the wrong domain. You\u2019re selling our national security for corporate profits.\u201d\nCrucial Quote\nIn an interview with CNBC last month, Lutnick defended the administration\u2019s decision to allow H20 exports to China, describing it as Nvidia\u2019s \u201cfourth best\u201d chip. \u201cWe don't sell them our best stuff, not our second best stuff, not even our third best,\u201d the commerce secretary said. \u201cWe want to keep having the Chinese use the American technology stack, because they still rely upon it...The idea is the Chinese are more than capable of building their own. You want to keep one step ahead of what they can build, so they keep buying our chips.\u201d\nNvidia and AMD to pay 15% of China chip sale revenues to US government (Financial Times)"

      "text": "Nvidia and AMD have agreed to pay the US government 15% of their revenues from semiconductor sales to China in exchange for export licenses, an unprecedented quid pro quo arrangement aimed at solidifying America\u2019s AI business dominance while maintaining trade ties with China.\nThe deal with the Trump administration allows the companies to obtain export licenses to sell Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips and AMD\u2019s MI308 chips in China, a US official told CNN. The Financial Times first reported the story Sunday.\nThe deal came together after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, the official said. Although the export licenses were granted Friday, no shipments have yet been made. It\u2019s still unclear how the deal will be structured, but the White House may use its recent trade agreements as a template.\n\u201cWe follow rules the US government sets for our participation in worldwide markets,\u201d a Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWhile we haven\u2019t shipped H20 to China for months, we hope export control rules will let America compete in China and worldwide.\u201d\nTrump calls the chips \u2018obsolete\u2019\nTrump said Monday that the AI chips he approved for sale to China are \u201cobsolete,\u201d but he left open the possibility that Nvidia could export its super high-end Blackwell chips for a higher price.\n\u201cThe chip that we\u2019re talking about, the H20, it\u2019s an old chip,\u201d Trump said at a press conference Monday. \u201cChina already has it in a different form, different name, but they have it.\u201d\nTrump said Huang, who met with the president Wednesday, wanted to sell the H20 AI chip to China after the Trump administration expressed openness to lifting its export ban on the technology. But Trump demanded payment to the US government in exchange for the export license.\nAt first, Trump said he wanted Nvidia to pay the US government 20% of sales of its AI chips exported to China, but they negotiated a rate of 15%.\n\u201cI said, if I\u2019m going to do that, I want you to pay us, as a country, something, because I\u2019m giving you a release,\u201d Trump said.\nThe H20 is a sophisticated AI processor, although it is not Nvidia\u2019s highest-end processor. The Blackwell chip is significantly more advanced, and the Trump administration has closed the door on the export of that technology to China \u2014 even after reversing course on the H20.\nHowever, Trump on Monday said that he\u2019d consider allowing Nvidia to sell the Blackwell chip if Nvidia pays the US government an even steeper cost.\n\u201cThe Blackwell is superduper advanced. I wouldn\u2019t make a deal with that, although it\u2019s possible,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019d make a deal \u2013 a somewhat enhanced in a negative way. Blackwell, in other words, take 30% to 50% off of it, but that\u2019s the latest and the greatest in the world. Nobody has it. They won\u2019t have it for five years.\u201d\nTrump said Huang will return to the White House in the future to discuss selling an \u201cunenhanced\u201d version of Blackwell.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s coming to see me again about that, but that will be a unenhanced version of the big one,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know, we will sometimes sell fighter jets to a country and we\u2019ll give them 20% less than we have.\u201d\nChina may not accept the chips\nThe AI chips are in extremely high demand and the arrangement could raise billions of dollars for the US government. But it\u2019s unclear how successful the venture will be, because China may not be willing to play ball: Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips pose security concerns for China, a social media account linked to Chinese state media said Sunday, as Washington and Beijing near a deadline to strike a deal in trade negotiations in which technology has also emerged as a key issue.\nChina could choose not to buy US tech firm Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips, said the account, Yuyuan Tantian, which is affiliated with state broadcaster CCTV, as it claimed that the artificial intelligence (AI) chips could have \u201cbackdoors\u201d that impact their function and security.\n\u201cWhen a type of chip is neither environmentally friendly, nor advanced, nor safe, as consumers, we certainly have the option not to buy it,\u201d said the commentary, which came after China\u2019s cybersecurity administration also raised concerns over backdoor access in those chips.\nNvidia has repeatedly denied that its products have backdoors.\nTrade friction\nChina\u2019s access to American technology, especially high-end chips that can be used in the development of artificial intelligence, has become a key issue in trade and tech frictions between the rival economies \u2013 as both vie for tech dominance.\nA trade truce between the two countries that reduced triple-digit tariffs is set to expire on August 12, though officials have signaled an extension could come into effect following talks in Sweden last month.\nNvidia last month said it would resume sales of the H20 chip to China after the White House changed course on export controls it imposed in April as its trade frictions with China deepened. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg in an interview at the time that the Nvidia export controls have been a \u201cnegotiating chip\u201d in the larger US-China trade talks.\nNvidia released the H20 chip last year to maintain access to the Chinese market following strict export controls put in place under the Biden administration that stopped the export of chips with greater processing power.\nNvidia\u2019s announcement last month that it would be able to export the H20 chip to China raised concerns among some US lawmakers, who support tight controls to prevent China from using American technology to advance its military and AI systems.\nTrump administration have correctly said that the H20 chips aren\u2019t the top-of-the-line AI chips that can build large language models. As a result, the White House has been willing to open up the market for those chips to maintain US business dominance in AI \u2013 without giving up the cream-of-the-crop chips to China, which administration officials say could still pose a national security threat.\nChina\u2019s mounting concern about the security of the chips comes after the White House last month recommended implementing export controls that would verify the location of advanced artificial intelligence chips. China\u2019s cyberspace regulator late last month summoned Nvidia over security concerns about \u201ctracking and positioning\u201d and \u201cremote shutdown\u201d capabilities.\nIn a blog post published last week, Nvidia reiterated that its chips did not have back doors, spyware or kill switches and said that \u201cembedding backdoors and kill switches into chips would be a gift to hackers and hostile actors.\u201d\nChina\u2019s security concerns appear to mirror those that the US has in the past expressed about Chinese technology, most prominently the first Trump administration\u2019s campaign against the growing foothold of Chinese tech giant Huawei in global communications infrastructure.\nChinese leaders have also pushed for the country\u2019s tech firms to become self-sufficient and reduce reliance on American-made chips to achieve Beijing\u2019s AI and tech ambitions, and experts have said that controls on chips like the H20 could push China to speed up its own innovation.\nBut the H20 is not the only technology that reports suggest is entangled with negotiations between the two sides.\nAccording to another report from the FT also published Sunday, China wants the US to ease export controls on a critical component for artificial intelligence chips as part of a trade deal ahead of a possible summit between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\nChinese officials have told experts in Washington that Beijing wants the Trump administration to relax export restrictions on high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, the FT reported, citing several people familiar with the matter.\nA spokesperson for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry on Monday sidestepped a media question about the report, but said China opposes both \u201cmalicious blockades and suppression of China\u201d and the \u201cweaponization of scientific and technological, economic, and trade issues.\u201d\n\u201cSuch practices disrupt the stability of the global supply chain and are not in the interests of anyone,\u201d spokesperson Lin Jian said. When asked to comment on reports that Nvidia and AMD have agreed to pay the US government 15% of their revenues from semiconductor sales to China, Lin said Beijing had \u201crepeatedly expressed\u201d its position on the issue of US chip exports.\nThe US government imposed export controls on the sale of high-bandwidth memory chips to China last year.\nThis story has been updated with additional information. CNN\u2019s Nectar Gan contributed reporting."
