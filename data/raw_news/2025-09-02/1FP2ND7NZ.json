  "content": "Lumber prices, which shed more than 20% in August, have continued to fall to start September, hitting their lowest price this year thanks to a glut of wood that was piled up ahead of a big increase in duties on Canadian imports. \"There has clearly been a speculative inventory accumulation at every level from mills to single location lumber dealers,\" said Matt Layman, a market analyst and consultant who publishes Layman\u2019s Lumber Guide \"For the first time in my 40-plus year career there is indeed a wall of wood that must be liquidated.\"\n\nWood buyers stocked up ahead of higher duties on Canadian lumber imports, which took effect last month. (Landon Speers for WSJ)\n\nAs with many raw materials, the lumber market has been whipsawed by President Trump's tariff threats. The White House is studying tariffs on imported lumber in the name of national security, as it has with steel, aluminum and copper products.",
