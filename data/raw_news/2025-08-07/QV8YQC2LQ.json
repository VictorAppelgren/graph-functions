  "content": "President Trump called on new Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to immediately resign amid allegations of having financial ties to the Chinese military \u2014 sending shares of the struggling US chipmaker lower Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem,\u201d Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform Thursday morning.\n\nIntel did not immediately respond to The Post\u2019s request for comment.\n\nIntel shares dropped nearly 2% after the opening bell.\n\nTan, who was born in Malaysia and grew up in Singapore, took the helm at Intel in March after the software giant ousted Pat Gelsinger following dismal earnings and several rounds of layoffs.\n\nLast year, the company was awarded $8.5 billion from the Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS Act under the Secure Enclave program, a national security initiative to make secure microchips for defense and intelligence applications.\n\nThe funding was later slashed by more than $600 million to about $7.85 billion but Intel still ranks as one of the top companies receiving the most federal funding.\n\nTrump\u2019s call for Tan to step aside comes on the heels of a letter sent to Intel\u2019s board on Wednesday by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) seeking information Tan\u2019s investments in businesses tied to the Chinese military and a criminal case involving his former employer, Cadence Design.\n\nCotton, the chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, wrote he is concerned \u201cabout the security and integrity of Intel\u2019s operations and its potential impact on US national security,\u201d in the missive to Intel Chairman Frank Leary, according to a copy obtained by The Post.\n\nA Reuters report earlier this year claimed Tan invested at least $200 million across hundreds of Chinese firms \u2013 some with links to the military and the Chinese Communist Party \u2013 between March 2012 and December 2024.\n\n\u201cIntel and Mr. Tan are deeply committed to the national security of the United States and the integrity of our role in the US defense ecosystem,\u201d an Intel spokesperson told The Post on Wednesday.\n\nCotton argued that Intel \u2013 as a major recipient of government grants \u2013 is \u201crequired to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Tan\u2019s associations raise questions about Intel\u2019s ability to fulfill these obligations,\u201d he added.\n\nTan\u2019s former employer Cadence Design last week agreed to pay more than $140 million to settle charges that it sold its chips to a Chinese military institution, according to a Reuters report.\n\nThose sales took place during Tan\u2019s tenure as CEO from 2008 to 2021.",

      "text": "Kentucky\u2019s $9B whiskey industry in crisis as Gen Z drinkers shun bourbon, tariffs take toll\nKentucky\u2019s legendary whiskey business is experiencing its worst crisis in decades, with major distilleries shutting down and thousands of jobs at risk as the industry struggles against declining sales, changing drinking habits among Gen Z consumers and damaging trade disputes.\nThree prominent Kentucky distilleries have collapsed into bankruptcy over the past eight months, marking a dramatic downturn for an industry that generates $9 billion annually for the state.\nLMD Holdings, which operates Luca Mariano Distillery, owes more than $25 million to creditors, while Garrard County Distilling faces nearly $26 million in debts.\nKentucky Owl, owned by international spirits company Stoli Group, has also filed for bankruptcy protection with millions in outstanding obligations.\nThe financial devastation extends far beyond individual companies. More than 23,000 workers across Kentucky\u2019s whiskey region depend on the industry for their livelihoods, with combined wages totaling $1.6 billion.\nEven established giants like Brown-Forman have eliminated hundreds of positions, while major producer Diageo has temporarily halted operations at Kentucky facilities.\nThe crisis stems from a dangerous combination of overproduction and rapidly shifting consumer preferences. During the bourbon boom of the 2000s, distilleries dramatically expanded production and investment, creating what industry experts now recognize as an unsustainable bubble.\nKentucky currently stores over 14.3 million aging barrels of whiskey \u2014 more than two barrels for every person living in the state.\nThis massive inventory buildup coincided with a sharp decline in demand.\nAmerican whiskey sales dropped 1.8% in 2024 to $5.2 billion, according to industry data.\nThe problem has been made worse by younger drinkers, particularly those in Gen Z who are abandoning traditional high-proof bourbon in favor of ready-to-drink canned cocktails and lighter alcoholic beverages like hard seltzers.\nSocial media platforms, especially TikTok, have accelerated this trend by promoting sweeter, lower-alcohol drinks as fashionable alternatives to whiskey. These viral trends have fundamentally changed how young adults view alcohol consumption, dealing a significant blow to bourbon\u2019s cultural appeal.\nAlcohol use among young Americans has declined sharply over the past two decades, with the share of adults under 35 who drink falling from 72% in the early 2000s to 62% today.\nBinge drinking and underage drinking have dropped significantly, with Gen Z consuming 20% less alcohol per capita than Millennials did at the same age.\nExperts attribute the shift to growing health awareness, changing social norms, the rise of alcohol alternatives and economic or cultural forces shaping how younger generations view drinking.\nInternational trade disputes have created additional headaches for Kentucky producers who rely heavily on export markets.\nCanada, which purchases $40 million worth of Kentucky bourbon annually, imposed retaliatory tariffs earlier this year in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s levies on Canadian imports.\nTrump\u2019s tariffs prompted Ontario retailers to remove American spirits from their shelves entirely. Michter\u2019s distillery alone lost $115,000 in cancelled Canadian orders.\nThe European Union presents an even larger threat, with plans to implement a 50% tariff on American whiskey that have been delayed several times in order to allow for trade negotiations to run their course.\nIn 2020, the bloc imposed a 35% tariff on American whiskey, causing exports to drop precipitously.\nThe financial pressure has exposed how many distilleries expanded too aggressively during the boom years, taking on risky debt loads that became impossible to manage as market conditions deteriorated.\nBoth startup operations and long-established companies have found themselves vulnerable to the sudden downturn.\nIndustry leaders are now calling for major changes to help distilleries survive what they describe as a perfect storm of challenges.\nProposed solutions include greater emphasis on sustainable production methods, expanded bourbon tourism experiences and development of ready-to-drink products that appeal to younger consumers.\nThe crisis extends beyond distillery walls, threatening grain farmers who supply raw materials, tourism businesses that depend on bourbon trail visitors, and entire communities built around whiskey production.\nWithout significant changes in consumer behavior or resolution of trade disputes, Kentucky\u2019s signature industry faces a period of painful shrinkage.\nIndustry analysts warn that conditions could deteriorate further if drinking trends continue moving away from traditional spirits and if international trade conflicts escalate.\nThe state\u2019s bourbon heritage, built over centuries, now confronts an uncertain future that will require dramatic adaptation to survive."

      "text": "GOP Sen. Tom Cotton questions new Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan over alleged ties to Chinese military\nA top Republican senator demanded new Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan reveal if he has any ties to China\u2019s Communist Party and military \u2013 citing national security concerns.\nIn a letter sent Wednesday to Intel Chairman Frank Leary, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) wrote that he is concerned \u201cabout the security and integrity of Intel\u2019s operations and its potential impact on US national security,\u201d according to a copy of the letter obtained by The Post.\nTan replaced ousted Intel chief Pat Gelsinger in March \u2014 a year after the struggling company was awarded a whopping $8 billion in Biden-era CHIPs Act funding.\nCotton\u2019s missive came after a report earlier this year claimed Tan invested at least $200 million across hundreds of Chinese firms between March 2012 and December 2024.\nSome of these advanced manufacturing and semiconductor firms have been linked to the Chinese Communist Party and military, Reuters reported in April.\nIn his letter, Cotton questioned whether the board had required Tan to divest from these stakes before assuming the CEO role.\nThe senator asked whether Tan had disclosed his remaining investments to the US government, since Intel has a responsibility as a major recipient of federal funding.\nHe also demanded to know whether the board was aware of subpoenas targeting Cadence Design \u2013 which Tan ran from 2008 to 2021 \u2013 before it hired him.\n\u201cIntel and Mr. Tan are deeply committed to the national security of the United States and the integrity of our role in the US defense ecosystem,\u201d an Intel spokesperson told The Post.\nIntel added that it will address the matter with Cotton, who asked for responses by Aug. 15.\n\u201cIntel is required to be a responsible steward of American taxpayer dollars and to comply with applicable security regulations,\u201d Cotton wrote in the letter.\n\u201cMr. Tan\u2019s associations raise questions about Intel\u2019s ability to fulfill these obligations.\u201d\nIn 2024, Intel was awarded $8.5 billion in CHIPs funding under the Secure Enclave program, a national security initiative to make secure microchips for defense and intelligence applications.\nLater that year, the government slashed that figure by more than $600 million to about $7.85 billion. Intel still ranks as one of the top companies receiving the most federal funding.\nA source familiar with the matter told Reuters in April that Tan had divested from his positions in Chinese firms.\nThe outlet reported at the time that Chinese databases still listed many of his investments as current.\nWhile it is not illegal for US citizens to hold stakes in Chinese companies, there is a US Treasury list of banned Chinese firms.\nReuters reported earlier this year that Tan was not invested directly in any company on that list.\nMeanwhile, Cadence Design last week agreed to plead guilty and pay more than $140 million to settle charges that it sold its chips to a Chinese military university, according to a Reuters report.\nThe institution was believed to be involved in simulating nuclear blasts, according to the report.\nThose sales took place under Tan\u2019s leadership at Cadence. After stepping down as CEO in 2021, Tan stayed on at Cadence as executive chairman through May 2023."

      "text": "JPMorgan and Bank of America \u2018debanked\u2019 Trump under pressure from Biden admin over January 6: sources\nJPMorgan and Bank of America \u201cdebanked\u201d President Trump for his role in the January 6 Capitol Hill melee following pressure from the Biden administration\u2019s banking regulators and the Federal Reserve, people with direct knowledge of the matter tell The Post.\nThe exact reason for Trump and his tens of millions of dollars in holdings being kicked off the JPMorgan banking platform, and then denied access to Bank of America\u2019s services, has yet to be reported.\nBut sources at the banks \u2014 the largest and second-largest in the US in terms of assets \u2014 confirmed the case stemmed from the controversy surrounding Trump\u2019s actions that day, and threats from President Joe Biden\u2019s bank regulators that banking the former president\u2019s money put them in danger of falling afoul of rules that prohibit financial institutions from doing business with individuals and companies that present a \u201creputational risk.\u201d\nPeople at the banks tell The Post that Biden\u2019s banking cops at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve often used the nebulous nature of the edict to go beyond debanking money launderers and drug kingpins.\nThey were pressured to include people who have heterodox political and business ties that often included conservatives and anyone who participated in the January 6 protests.\nTrump, of course, survived it all and is now in his second presidential term. He is vowing to end debanking; his regulators have stopped enforcing the reputational risk clause and he plans an executive order in the matter.\n\u201cThink back to what it was like being Trump back in 2021; he was a hot potato after January 6 and the regulators made it clear to us that we shouldn\u2019t do business with him,\u201d said one banking executive with direct knowledge of the matter.\nAn executive at JPMorgan said regulators \u201cput the fear of God in you if you did business\u201d with people like Trump.\nThat could mean increased surveillance and fines for various issues. Banks found it easier simply to avoid taking as customers people who presented this risk, even if they were like Trump and looking to open accounts with tens of millions of dollars in assets.\nA Bank of America spokesman declined comment. JPMorgan said in a statement: \u201cWe don\u2019t close accounts for political reasons, and we agree with President Trump that regulatory change is desperately needed. We commend the White House for addressing this issue and look forward to working with them to get this right.\u201d\nA bank rep wouldn\u2019t deny that the reputation risk edict was at the heart of its debanking of Trump.\nTrump himself revealed that he was debanked Tuesday in an interview with the financial network CNBC. He said he was denied services at both institutions sometime after his first term ended in January 2021, just weeks after the storming of the Capitol that political opponents of Trump have described as a riot and insurrection.\nFirst, he said, he was booted by JPMorgan.\n\u201cI had 100s of millions. I had many, many accounts loaded up with cash. I was loaded up with cash, and they told me, \u2018I\u2019m sorry, sir, we can\u2019t have you. You have 20 days to get out.\u2019 I said, \u2018You\u2019ve got to be kidding. I\u2019ve been with you for 35, 40 years.\u2019 \u201d\nThen he was denied services by Bank of America. During the interview, he named both JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Brian Moynihan of Bank of America, stating both refused to come to his defense.\nHe said Moynihan \u201cwas kissing my ass when I was president, and when I called him after I was president to deposit a billion dollars plus and a lot of other things, more importantly to open accounts, which banks always like \u2026 And he said, \u2018We can\u2019t do it.'\u201d\nTrump and his regulators have sought to end the practice and he\u2019s issuing an executive order imminently to end politically motivated debanking.\nSen. Tim Scott (R-SC) is pushing legislation that would outlaw the practices.\n\u201cIt is unacceptable for banks to discriminate against customers or prospective customers based on political or religious beliefs. As Comptroller of the Currency, I intend to assess the size and scope of this problem and take appropriate action to depoliticize the federal banking system, and ensure banks provide fair access to financial services as required by law,\u201d Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan V. Gould told The Post.\nReps from the Fed and the FDIC declined to comment."

      "text": "Chipmaker Intel Corp. is cutting 15% of its massive workforce \u2014 about 15,000 jobs \u2014 as it tries to turn its business around to compete with more successful rivals like Nvidia and AMD.\nIn a memo to staff, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said Thursday the company plans to save $10 billion in 2025. \u201cSimply put, we must align our cost structure with our new operating model and fundamentally change the way we operate,\u201d he wrote in the memo published to Intel\u2019s website. \u201cOur revenues have not grown as expected \u2013 and we\u2019ve yet to fully benefit from powerful trends, like AI. Our costs are too high, our margins are too low.\u201d\nThe job cuts come in the heels of a disappointing quarter and forecast for the iconic chip maker founded in 1968 at the start of the PC revolution.\nNext week, Gelsinger wrote, Intel will announce an \u201cenhanced retirement offering\u201d for eligible employees and offer an application program for voluntary departures. Intel had 124,800 employees as of the end of 2023 according to a regulatory filing.\n\u201cThese decisions have challenged me to my core, and this is the hardest thing I\u2019ve done in my career,\u201d he said. The bulk of the layoffs are expected to be completed this year.\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company is also suspending its stock dividend as part of a broader plan to cut costs.\nIntel reported a loss for its second quarter along with a small revenue decline, and it forecast third-quarter revenues below Wall Street\u2019s expectations.\nThe company posted a loss of $1.6 billion, or 38 cents per share, in the April-June period. That\u2019s down from a profit of $1.5 billion, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings excluding special items were 2 cents per share.\nRevenue slid 1% to $12.8 billion from $12.9 billion.\nAnalysts, on average, were expecting earnings of 10 cents per share on revenue of $12.9 billion, according to a poll by FactSet.\n\u201cIntel\u2019s announcement of a significant cost-cutting plan including layoffs may bolster its near-term financials, but this move alone is insufficient to redefine its position in the evolving chip market,\u201d said eMarketer analyst Jacob Bourne. \u201cThe company faces a critical juncture as it leverages U.S. investment in domestic manufacturing and the surging global demand for AI chips to establish itself in chip fabrication.\u201d\nHelped by Gelsinger\u2019s lobbying efforts, Intel has been a major beneficiary of the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which the Biden administration helped shepherd through Congress at a time of concerns after the pandemic that the loss of access to chips made in Asia could plunge the U.S. economy into recession.\nIn March, President Joe Biden celebrated an agreement to provide Intel with up to $8.5 billion in direct funding and $11 billion in loans for computer chip plants around the country, talking up the investment in the political battleground state of Arizona and calling it a way of \u201cbringing the future back to America.\u201d At the time, Gelsinger called the CHIPS Act \u201cthe most critical industrial policy legislation since World War II.\u201d\nIn September 2022, Biden praised Intel as a job creator with its plans to open a new plant near Columbus, Ohio. The president praised them for plans to \u201cbuild a workforce of the future\u201d for the $20 billion project, which he said would generate 7,000 construction jobs and 3,000 full-time jobs set to pay an average of $135,000 a year.\nShares plunged more than 20% to $23.82 in after-hours trading, indicating that Intel could lose roughly $24 billion of its market value when the stock market opens Friday."

      "text": "Major hotel chain faces backlash for allegedly outsourcing check-ins \u2014 to India\nA Miami hotel is facing backlash over a viral video that claims the front desk was staffed by an outsourced worker to welcome new guests during the check-in process.\nIn the video, a guest who booked a stay at a La Quinta by Wyndham was welcomed by a tall screen displaying a virtual front-desk employee \u2014 who allegedly was in India.\n\u201cDo you need one room key or two room key?\u201d the worker can be heard asking in the video, which has more than 2 million views since being posted on Saturday.\nThe guest replies: \u201cTwo, just in case I lose one.\u201d\nThe hotel customer then signs a form on the screen using their finger.\nThe interaction led social media users to slam the hotel chain for outsourcing jobs to overseas workers.\n\u201cMore American jobs outsourced overseas. At some point this should just become illegal. If you make money in America, you should hire Americans,\u201d one user wrote in a post on X.\nAnother sniped: \u201cWhat hotel, so I can be sure to avoid it?\u201d\nSome frustrated users even called on President Trump to target the practice by slapping tariffs on US-based companies that outsource jobs to overseas staffers.\nA spokesperson for Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, which owns La Quinta Inn, told The Post that it just learned about the matter and is actively investigating the situation.\n\u201cThis is a franchised location, meaning the hotel is independently owned and operated, and as such, we don\u2019t control staffing. That said, this franchisee\u2019s use of this equipment is not brand approved nor is it being marketed to other franchisees,\u201d a spokesperson told The Post in a statement.\n\u201cFurther, our brand standards require hotels to have a team member physically stationed at the front desk at all times.\u201d\nThe chain has several La Quinta locations in the Miami area.\nIt\u2019s unclear how widespread the practice of outsourced virtual front-desk employees is at La Quinta hotels and other chains.\nWyndham does offer mobile check-in for some guests, according to its website.\nA video posted to YouTube in February appears to show the same large tablet screen being used by an outsourced worker in a Wyndham hotel in Bonita Springs, Fla.\n\u201cI checked into a hotel by talking to a man on a screen in the entryway. I scanned my ID, swiped my credit card, and the machine provided me a key,\u201d the user who posted the video wrote in the caption.\nAnother social media user said they had a similar experience with a virtual front-desk employee at a hotel in Dublin.\n\u201cHonestly, it was a lot quicker than dealing with front desk staff, and it prints out your keycard,\u201d the hotel guest wrote in a post online.\nMeanwhile, a hotel in Amsterdam allegedly used a fully automated check-in process, where guests fill out a form on an iPad, take a key card from a pile and tap it on a reader to activate it, according to another user on X.\n\u201cThere\u2019s really no reason for these jobs at all in today\u2019s age,\u201d they added."
