      "summary": "Douglas Tires, owned by Goodyear and sold at Walmart, are priced at $50–$120 and provide a budget-friendly option for commuters, with mixed user reviews: many praise their consistency and up to 60,000 miles, while others note rapid tread wear and durability issues. Premium brands such as Michelin, Continental, and Goodyear offer better performance, shorter stopping distances, and longer life, but at a higher cost. Douglas tires can last 40–60,000 miles for some users, though some report deterioration after three years; proper maintenance—alignment, rotation, and pressure checks—can extend their life. Overall, Douglas is a solid choice for tight budgets but may not match premium performance or longevity.",
