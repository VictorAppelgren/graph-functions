  "content": "Consuelo Hayden was among thousands of Porter Ranch residents affected by a major water service outage that started Aug. 5.\n\nThe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power lifted a \u201cboil water\u201d notice Tuesday afternoon for Granada Hills and Porter Ranch, ending a weeklong episode that saw residents\u2019 taps run dry or slow to a trickle.\n\nThe DWP urged residents to flush out all water pipes and appliances before using the water.\n\nAbout 9,200 households in the western San Fernando Valley were affected by a water service outage that started last week after DWP workers discovered a faulty valve, according to the agency.\n\nThe valve, which was installed in 1967 and located 20 feet underground, was stuck in a nearly closed position and could not be opened, which impeded the flow of water.\n\nReaching the valve was complicated by a nearby fiber-optic cable, a high-pressure gas line and an oil line, according to the DWP.\n\nOn Monday morning, the water flow resumed, but a boil water notice remained in place.\n\nDWP\u2019s chief executive and chief engineer, Janisse Qui\u00f1ones, thanked the public for their \u201ccooperation and patience\u201d in a statement Tuesday.\n\nThe DWP said in a news release that those customers affected by the \u201cboil water\u201d notice would receive a $20 credit.\n\nThe agency has a long list of recommendations, including flushing out any stagnant water by running outside plumbing; running all indoor cold-water faucets for five minutes or until the water is clear and the temperature is constant; and draining hot water tanks to remove sediment and then running hot water faucets.\n\nIn addition, customers who have a water dispenser on their refrigerator should flush the device or five minutes; make and discard three batches of ice cubes and clean the ice bin with a disinfectant.\n\nThey should also clean and disinfect aerators and screens on faucets, shower heads and fixtures; run empty dishwashers and washing machines once on the rinse cycle; replace all filters and reset all water devices from \u201cbypass mode\u201d; replace pre-filters for reverse osmosis units; and run water softeners through a regeneration cycle.",

The government has asked for $1 billion and sweeping campus changes to restore the funds.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 As Gov. Gavin Newsom and the University of California consider whether to sue the Trump administration to restore more than half a billion dollars in federal grants to UCLA, the White House on Tuesday had a terse response.\n\u201cBring it on, Gavin,\u201d said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt when asked about Newsom\u2019s opposition to a Trump plan demanding more than $1 billion and sweeping campus changes at UCLA to resolve federal antisemitism findings against the university.\n\u201cThis administration is well within its legal right to do this, and we want to ensure that our colleges and our universities are respecting the 1st Amendment rights and the religious liberties of students on their campuses and UCLA has failed to do that, and I have a whole list of examples that I will forward to Gavin Newsom\u2019s press office, if he hasn\u2019t seen them himself,\u201d Leavitt said.\nThe statement was the first public comment from the White House about the high-stakes conflict between the nation\u2019s premier public university system and the Trump administration, which has accused UCLA of violating the civil rights of Jewish students, illegally considering race in admissions and treating transgender people in sports, healthcare and campus life in ways that the government claims hinder women\u2019s rights.\nUCLA is in conflict with the Trump administration, which has frozen federal grants and demanded a $1-billion fine over a host of allegations. Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state will sue.\nLeavitt spoke after a question from The Times about how Trump would respond to Newsom\u2019s comments late last week that the settlement offer for UCLA was \u201cextortion\u201d and \u201cransom.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll sue,\u201d Newsom said Friday.\nResponding to Leavitt\u2019s comments, a Newsom spokesperson pointed The Times to a meme posted on X after the news conference.\n\u201cGlorious leader is entitled to all treasures of the realm, especially from universities,\u201d said the post from Newsom\u2019s press office account. The graphic features an image of what appears to a be a North Korean news anchor with a North Korean flag in the background.\nIn an earlier joint statement with California legislative leaders, Newsom said that the action against UCLA \u201cisn\u2019t about protecting Jewish students \u2014 it\u2019s a billion-dollar political shakedown from the pay-to-play president. Trump has weaponized the Department of Justice to punish California, crush free thinking, and kneecap the greatest public university system in the world.\u201d\nNo lawsuit has been filed and the UC Board of Regents, which held an emergency meeting Monday afternoon over the grant cuts, has not announced how it will proceed aside from calling Trump\u2019s current terms \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\nNewsom sits as a voting member on the 24-person board, has appointed several of its members and can wield influence on the body, although the final decision on a lawsuit or settlement rests with the regents. Newsom did not attend Monday\u2019s meeting.\nIn a statement after the meeting, a UC spokesperson said the $1-billion price tag would be \u201cdevastating.\u201d\n\u201cUC\u2019s leadership spent recent days evaluating the demand, updating the UC community, and engaging with stakeholders,\u201d said Meredith Turner, UC senior vice president of external relations. \u201cOur focus remains on protecting students\u2019 access to a UC education and promoting the academic freedom, excellence, and innovation that have always been at the heart of UC\u2019s work.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has suspended $584 million in grants at UCLA over what the U.S. Department of Justice has described as the school\u2019s \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to Jewish students\u2019 civil rights.\nHundreds of grants \u2014 from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health and Department of Energy \u2014 are on hold at UCLA. The money funds research into cancer, math, brain science and other areas, and helps pay for graduate student stipends and tuition as well as lab upkeep. If the freezes stay for the long term, administrators are considering layoffs and other budget reductions.\nCiting the reasons for the freezes, a July 30 NSF letter to UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk alleged UCLA \u201cengages in racism, in the form of illegal affirmative action, UCLA fails to promote a research environment free of antisemitism and bias; UCLA discriminates against and endangers women by allowing men in women\u2019s sports and private women-only spaces.\u201d\nFrenk, in a campuswide message the next day, disputed the funding halt.\n\u201cThis far-reaching penalty of defunding life-saving research does nothing to address any alleged discrimination,\u201d he wrote."

      "text": "L.A. City Councilman Curren Price to face new corruption charges\n- Share via\n- Prosecutors filed two additional charges against City Councilman Curren Price this week.\n- He was first accused in 2023 of embezzlement, perjury and violating state conflict of interest laws for votes on city business that could have financially benefited his wife.\nL.A. County prosecutors filed two additional corruption charges this week against City Councilman Curren Price, who is already facing multiple counts of grand theft and perjury for allegedly voting in favor of projects his wife had a financial interest in, authorities said Tuesday.\nIn June 2023, Price was charged with 10 counts of grand theft by embezzlement, perjury and conflict of interest. Prosecutors said Price\u2019s wife \u2014 Del Richardson, founder of the consulting company Del Richardson & Associates \u2014 received \u201cpayments totaling more than $150,000 between 2019 and 2021 from developers before [Price] voted to approve projects.\u201d\nThe perjury charges stem from a claim that Price didn\u2019t list his wife\u2019s income on disclosure forms. Prosecutors also accused Price of theft by embezzlement for bilking the city out of tens of thousands of dollars by placing Richardson on his city-issued healthcare plan between 2013 and 2017, before they were legally married.\nIn a statement issued late Tuesday, prosecutors said subpoenas issued since 2023 yielded evidence to support conflict charges related to two other votes that Price cast.\nBetween October 2019 and June 2020, Richardson was paid roughly $609,000 by the city housing authority, according to the district attorney\u2019s office. During the same time period, Price voted in favor of a \u201c$35 million federal grant and a state grant application for $252 million,\u201d according to the D.A.\u2019s news release.\nProsecutors also allege Price authored a motion to give L.A. Metro $30 million between October 2020 and October 2021, a time frame where Richardson was paid upwards of $200,000 by the transit agency.\n\u201cEmbezzling public funds and awarding contracts for your own financial gain is the antithesis of public service,\u201d Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Nathan Hochman said in a statement. \u201cOur communities expect and deserve better from their public officials.\u201d\nPrice\u2019s attorney, Michael Schafler, called the new charges \u201cnothing more than an attempt to pile on to a weak case.\u201d\n\u201cThey have gone back as much as 6 years, combing through thousands and thousands of votes, to find a couple more allegedly conflicted votes, hoping that the public will overlook the fact that there is no evidence whatsoever that Councilmember Price was aware of the alleged conflicts when he voted for the agenda items,\u201d Schafler said in a statement.\nThe original criminal complaint was filed roughly four years after a Times investigation found Price had repeatedly cast votes that affected housing developers and other firms listed as clients of his wife\u2019s consulting company.\nIn an October 2023 motion seeking to dismiss the initial charges, Price\u2019s legal team argued prosecutors failed to show the payments to Richardson had any influence on the councilman\u2019s votes. Many of the votes described in the criminal complaint were also approved by an overwhelming majority of the council, meaning Price did not swing any one decision that could financially benefit Richardson.\nSchafler also argued the embezzlement charges are invalid because Price did not have control over the funds used to pay for Richardson\u2019s healthcare, which is a required element of the crime under California law. Price\u2019s conduct might meet the definition of grand theft, Schafler wrote in 2023, but the statute of limitations for that crime had long expired.\nA judge rejected Schafler\u2019s motion. Price is expected to face a preliminary hearing later this year.\nPrice, who was first elected in 2013, must leave office due to term limits at the end of 2026. Several candidates have already launched campaigns to replace him in a district that stretches from the Los Angeles Convention Center in downtown to 95th Street in South L.A.\nTimes Staff Writer David Zahniser contributed to this report."

      "text": "The next \u2018Big One\u2019 on the San Andreas fault might not be the earthquake we expect, researchers say\n- Share via\n- A new report studied a massive earthquake that ruptured in the southeast Asian country of Myanmar on March 28 \u2014 on a fault known for being eerily similar to California\u2019s notorious San Andreas fault.\n- While the recent quake could hold vital clues for California\u2019s next \u201cBig One,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author notes that, \u201cEarthquakes never come back exactly the same way.\u201d\nWhat could the next mega-earthquake on California\u2019s notorious San Andreas fault look like?\nWould it be a repeat of 1857, when an earthquake estimated at magnitude 7.7 to 7.9 ruptured the fault from Monterey County all the way through Los Angeles County? Would it be more akin to the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which began just offshore of the city and ruptured in two directions, toward Humboldt County and Santa Cruz County?\nDon\u2019t bet on an identical sequel.\nThat\u2019s the implication of a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The report, coauthored by scientists at Caltech in Pasadena, studied a massive earthquake that ruptured in the southeast Asian country of Myanmar on March 28 \u2014 on a fault known for being eerily similar to the San Andreas.\nThe earthquake ended up rupturing a much longer section of the fault than scientists expected, given the seismology of the region.\nThe implications of this study are that \u201cearthquakes never come back exactly the same way,\u201d Solene L. Antoine, a postdoctoral fellow at Caltech and the study\u2019s lead author, said in an interview.\n\u201cIt came as a surprise that you could get such a long rupture,\u201d said Jean-Philippe Avouac, a coauthor of the study and a professor of geology and mechanical and civil engineering at Caltech.\nMarch\u2019s Mandalay earthquake devastated Myanmar, killing at least 3,791 people and an additional 63 people in Thailand. High-rise buildings were damaged as far away as Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam and homes were damaged in the Ruili area of China. Damage was estimated at $1.9 billion, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\nIt was the most powerful earthquake in Myanmar in at least 79 years.\nThe magnitude 7.7 earthquake ruptured an astonishing 317 miles of the Sagaing fault, a finding based on Antoine\u2019s analysis of satellite data showing earth movement after the quake. That\u2019s the longest seismic rupture ever documented on a continent.\nBy comparison, California\u2019s 1906 earthquake ruptured 296 miles of the San Andreas fault; and the 1857 earthquake, 225 miles. Longer seismic ruptures have been found only on subduction megathrusts deep underneath the ocean.\nWhat\u2019s clear from the study is that while California\u2019s next \u201cBig One\u201d may share some characteristics of previously documented devastating quakes, it\u2019s unlikely to be an exact replay. As the recent experience in Myanmar shows, even well-documented faults can behave in surprising ways.\nThe next step is to develop a model simulating earthquakes over many millennia for the San Andreas fault, which the authors plan to do in the future. But the San Andreas fault \u201cis far more complex,\u201d Avouac said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to come soon, because it\u2019s quite a heavy calculation.\u201d\nStill, such simulations would provide a model of \u201call possible scenarios so that we have a better view of the range of possible ruptures that could happen.\u201d\nFor instance, maybe the San Andreas fault will rupture in smaller, separate earthquakes, Avouac said.\nOr it could be a much larger earthquake \u2014 rupturing the fault not just from Monterey to Los Angeles counties, but perhaps all the way into San Bernardino, Riverside and Imperial counties, which would possibly exceed magnitude 8. Such a quake would be the largest simultaneous disaster in modern California history, with huge swaths of the state wracked by powerful seismic shaking all at once.\nBy comparison, the 1994 Northridge earthquake\u2019s footprint was relatively constrained, severely affecting only a portion of Los Angeles County, especially the San Fernando Valley \u2014 related to its relatively smaller magnitude of 6.7.\nBut while modeling previous activity on the San Andreas fault will provide a glimpse into the wide range of possible outcomes, it will not pinpoint precisely when the next great quake will strike.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just expect the exact same thing to happen,\u201d Antoine said. \u201cIt is a matter of just showing what scenarios are possible, the diversity of scenarios and seeing what are the consequences of each of those scenarios.\u201d\nSometimes, Avouac said, \u201cit\u2019s quiet for a long time, nothing happens ... stress is building up, the fault is locked for a long time, nothing happens, and then, boom, you have a large earthquake.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then you have other periods during which you have a lot of [seismic] activity, but these earthquakes are all smaller,\u201d Avouac said.\nBut \u201csmaller\u201d earthquakes, in the minds of researchers, are still big to the layperson. In the study\u2019s simulations, there are periods where earthquakes around magnitude 7.7 are common. In other periods, earthquakes max out at magnitude 7.5 or so, but are more frequent.\nThe entire length of the Sagaing fault \u2014 including areas that didn\u2019t rupture in the March earthquake \u2014 is 750 miles, north to south, from the Himalayas to the Andaman Sea, and helps accommodate the northward push of the Indian tectonic plate.\nThe fact that 317 miles of the Sagaing fault ruptured in March was surprising to scientists. Only about 170 miles had been quiet seismically for more than a century, having last ruptured in 1839.\nScientists call these \u201cseismic gaps\u201d \u2014 particular areas of a fault that haven\u2019t recently ruptured.\nGenerally, scientists would\u2019ve expected only this long-dormant 170-mile piece of the Sagaing fault to rupture, Avouac said, but not more recently ruptured sections. That includes a 100-mile stretch that ruptured in large earthquakes in 1929 and 1930, and a 50-mile stretch that went off in a pair of quakes in 1946 and 1956.\nInstead, even those fault segments ruptured in the big March earthquake.\nSo what gives?\nA possible explanation is the Sagaing fault\u2019s extraordinary smoothness. \u201cAnd people have observed that when the fault is very smooth, the rupture ... tends to propagate at a velocity\u201d so fast that it results in an \u201cextremely elongated rupture,\u201d Avouac said.\nThe study also published the results of a computer model simulation looking at how earthquakes might rupture along sections of the entire 750-mile long Sagaing fault. The code, developed by study coauthor Kyungjae Im of Caltech, suggests that over a hypothetical 1,400-year period, there would be no repeatable patterns.\nIn other words, earthquakes didn\u2019t seem to re-occur like clockwork, rupturing the same stretch of fault in a repeatable, predictable pattern.\n\u201cThere is complexity here. And this is because each time you have an earthquake, it redistributes the stress on the fault, which is going to influence the next earthquake,\u201d Avouac said. \u201cThere\u2019s a self-induced complexity in the process, and that leads to a bit of randomness.\u201d\nThere is one certainty, which is bound to disappoint anyone who shares the hope that a \u201cBig One\u201d simply won\u2019t ever strike California again.\n\u201cThere will be an earthquake at some point,\u201d Antoine said. \u201cIf there is stress building up on the fault, the fault won\u2019t hold forever.\u201d\nFurther research and observations are essential to refine models of future possible earthquakes, including from the Sentinel satellites, which are operated by the European Space Agency, the authors said.\nThe other coauthors of the study are Rajani Shrestha and Chris Milliner of Caltech; Chris Rollins of Earth Sciences New Zealand; Kang Wang of the Washington-based EarthScope Consortium; and Kejie Chen of the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China."

Restoring drinking water will also require testing.\nCrews have completed repairs to part of L.A.\u2019s water system and plan to restore water service for thousands of residents in Granada Hills and Porter Ranch who have been dealing with a days-long outage, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power said Sunday afternoon.\nDWP officials are continuing to urge residents, however, to hold off on using the water until service is fully restored and testing has confirmed the water is safe to drink and use.\nAfter cutting and removing a broken valve underground, workers on Sunday finished welding a new section of pipe into place.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve begun filling a section of the pipe with water to help prepare the rest of the affected system to begin receiving water,\u201d said Ellen Cheng, a DWP spokesperson. \u201cWe\u2019re making progress, but we actually need customers to still not use tap water because a lot of work is still happening in the field.\u201d\nThe department aims to have water service restored for about 9,200 customers in the area on Monday morning. However, a notice is still in effect urging residents to boil water for safety before using it. DWP could lift that boil order as soon as Tuesday, once testing is completed.\n\u201cWe want to ask customers to still refrain from using water until we give the all-clear,\u201d Cheng said.\nThe problem arose on Tuesday, when a valve that controls the flow of water broke during repairs at a pump station that supplies a 10-million-gallon water tank.\nThe valve that broke was installed in 1967, officials said. It was stuck in a nearly closed position and could not be opened, which impeded the flow of water.\nThe work of reaching the valve 20 feet underground was complicated because, as workers dug to reach it, they encountered fiber-optic cable, a high-pressure gas line and an oil line, said Anselmo Collins, DWP senior assistant general manager.\n\u201cWe are doing this as quickly as possible, but also as safely as possible,\u201d Collins said in an interview. \u201cI think they did an excellent job in fixing that, considering all the circumstances and utilities that were in the way.\n\u201cI know it\u2019s very frustrating for our customers, but I think we\u2019ve made a lot of progress under difficult circumstances,\u201d Collins said. \u201cWe are getting close to getting this issue resolved and restoring normal supply to the region.\u201d\nDays after Granada Hills and Porter Ranch lost water service, L.A. Mayor Karen Bass and other officials urged thousands of customers to stop using water, saying toilet flushes and lawn sprinklers were slowing repairs.\nOver the last few days, city officials have urged residents not to use water that has started to come out of their faucets, warning that this could delay the completion of the repairs.\nWith the repairs completed, DWP officials said theyneed to repressurize the system in the area and carry out testing. They said the agency would need to send water samples to a lab and get the results back, which can take about 18 hours, and that this process must be repeated for confirmation to comply with drinking water guidelines.\nL.A. City Councilmember John Lee said that, if all goes as planned, once the system is repressurized, water use for \u201cnon-consumption purposes\u201d might be possible as early as Monday morning.\n\u201cThis is a positive step, but I strongly urge customers to wait until LADWP indicates that the system can support usage,\u201d Lee said in a written statement. He added that the notice for residents to boil water for drinking and cooking purposes would remain in place until the DWP verified the water testing results.\nWhile the work was underway, another problem occurred in one area of Granada Hills. DWP workers had installed two lines of hose-like temporary pipe to transport water from the Metropolitan Water District, the region\u2019s water wholesaler, to a city pipe, and on Saturday one of those hoses popped off a connection and sent water shooting into a backyard in Granada Hills.\nThe DWP shut down that connection point, Collins said, and was looking into why the temporary pipe was dislodged.\nMeanwhile, workers are using pumps to route water through multiple connection points into that zone of the city\u2019s system, Collins said.\nDuring the water service outage, DWP has set up five locations where residents can pick up bottled water, shower and do laundry:\n- Holleigh Bernson Memorial Park, 20500 Sesnon Blvd., Porter Ranch: bottled water, recycled water distribution, restrooms, showers, mobile laundry units. 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.\n- O\u2019Melveny Park, 17300 Sesnon Blvd., Granada Hills: bottled water, recycled water distribution, restrooms. 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.\n- Intersection of Tampa Avenue And Sesnon Boulevard on the border of Northridge and Porter Ranch: bottled water and recycled water distribution. 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.\n- YMCA, 11336 Corbin St., Porter Ranch: showers, mobile laundry units. 5 a.m. to 10 p.m.\n- Intersection of Rinaldi Street and Louise Avenue: showers, mobile laundry units, restrooms. 5 a.m. to 10 p.m."

Residents were told that a boil water notice would remain in effect for several more days.\nThe notice instructs residents to only used boiled tap water or bottled water for drinking and cooking.\nThe L.A. Department of Water and Power says crews completed repairs on an underground water pipe and plan to restore service soon for thousands in Granada Hills and Porter Ranch.\nCustomers \u201ccan now use tap water to take showers, flush toilets, water landscaping and other household and business needs. However, the Boil Water Notice remains in effect until LADWP completes its rigorous water quality testing,\u201d read a DWP notice.\nPorter Ranch resident Matt Pakucko relied on free bottled water from the DWP after the water stopped regularly flowing at his home last week.\n\u201cIt was like camping out without the fun parts,\u201d said Pakucko. With the water back on, he plans to flush out his water system, including changing the filter in his refrigerator and draining his water heater.\nHe criticized what he called the mixed messaging from the city over the last few days. Mayor Karen Bass, he said, told the public to conserve water, while the DWP said not to use water.\nA representative for the DWP didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment about the messaging.\nThe agency announced Monday that all fire hydrants in the affected area are now available to support firefighting efforts if necessary.\nTemporary mobile showers and laundry facilities will shut down at 10 p.m. Monday, but water bottle distribution and recycled water distribution will remain available at select locations.\nThe problem arose on Tuesday, when a valve that controls the flow of water broke during repairs at a pump station that supplies a 10-million-gallon water tank.\nThe valve that broke was installed in 1967, officials said.
