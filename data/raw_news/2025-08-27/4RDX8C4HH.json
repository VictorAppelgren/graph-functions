  "content": "Detecting diabetes might soon be as easy as breathing into a device, a new study says.\n\nAn experimental breath test sorted out type 2 diabetes patients from healthy people, based on their exhalations, researchers report in the September issue of the Chemical Engineering Journal.\n\n\"This sensor only requires that you exhale into a bag, dip the sensor in and wait a few minutes for results,\" senior researcher Huanyu \"Larry\" Cheng, an associate professor of engineering science and mechanics at Penn State, said in a news release.\n\nIf validated, this test could prove simpler than the complicated blood testing and lab work now required to diagnose diabetes, researchers said.\n\nOf the 37 million adults with diabetes in the U.S., about 1 in 5 isn't aware that they have the condition, researchers said in background notes.\n\nThe sensor detects acetone, a chemical byproduct of energy production in the human body.\n\nEveryone's breath contains acetone, but elevated acetone levels indicate that a person has diabetes, researchers said.\n\nResearchers exposed the sensor to the breath of 51 people with type 2 diabetes and 20 healthy volunteers, all of whom exhaled into aluminum foil bags.\n\nThe sensor responded differently to people with type 2 diabetes, results showed.\n\nFurther, the sensor response tracked with the participants' blood sugar levels. This shows that with work, the sensor might be powerful enough to help track blood sugar levels on a regular basis, rather than just as a simple test for diabetes, Cheng said.\n\n\"If we could better understand how acetone levels in the breath change with diet and exercise, in the same way we see fluctuations in glucose levels depending on when and what a person eats, it would be a very exciting opportunity to use this for health applications beyond diagnosing diabetes,\" Cheng said.\n\nResearchers next plan to improve the sensor so it can be used directly under a person's nose or attached to the inside of a mask, to make it easier to use.\n\nThe American Diabetes Association has more on diabetes diagnosis.",

      "text": "There are several ways to diagnose diabetes. Each way usually needs to be repeated on a second day to diagnose diabetes.\nTesting should be carried out in a health care setting (such as your doctor\u2019s office or a lab). If your doctor determines that your blood glucose (blood sugar) level is very high, or if you have classic symptoms of high blood glucose in addition to one positive test, your doctor may not require a second test to diagnose diabetes.\nA1C\nThe A1C test measures your average blood glucose for the past two to three months. The advantages of being diagnosed this way are that you don't have to fast or drink anything.\nDiabetes is diagnosed at an A1C of greater than or equal to 6.5%\n| Result | A1C |\n|---|---|\n| Normal | less than 5.7% |\n| Prediabetes | 5.7% to 6.4% |\n| Diabetes | 6.5% or higher |\nFasting Plasma Glucose (FPG)\nThis test checks your fasting blood glucose levels. Fasting means after not having anything to eat or drink (except water) for at least 8 hours before the test. This test is usually done first thing in the morning, before breakfast.\nDiabetes is diagnosed at fasting blood glucose of greater than or equal to 126 mg/dl\n| Result | Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) |\n|---|---|\n| Normal | less than 100 mg/dL |\n| Prediabetes | 100 mg/dl to 125 mg/dL |\n| Diabetes | 126 mg/dL or higher |\nOral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)\nThe OGTT is a two-hour test that checks your blood glucose levels before and two hours after you drink a special sweet drink. It tells the doctor how your body processes sugar.\nDiabetes is diagnosed at two-hour blood glucose of greater than or equal to 200 mg/dl\n| Result | Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) |\n|---|---|\n| Normal | less than 140 mg/dL |\n| Prediabetes | 140 to 199 mg/dL |\n| Diabetes | 200 mg/dL or higher |\nRandom (also called Casual) Plasma Glucose Test\nThis test is a blood check at any time of the day when you have severe diabetes symptoms.\nDiabetes is diagnosed at blood glucose of greater than or equal to 200 mg/dl\nWhat is Prediabetes?\nBefore people develop type 2 diabetes, they almost always have prediabetes\u2014blood glucose levels that are higher than normal but not yet high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes.\nDoctors sometimes refer to prediabetes as impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG), depending on what test was used when it was detected. This condition puts you at a higher risk for developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.\nSymptoms\nThere are no clear symptoms of prediabetes, so you may have it and not know it.\nSome people with prediabetes may have some of the symptoms of diabetes or even problems from diabetes already. You usually find out that you have prediabetes when being tested for diabetes.\nIf you have prediabetes, you should be checked for type 2 diabetes every one to two years.\nResults indicating prediabetes are:\n- An A1C of 5.7\u20136.4%\n- Fasting blood glucose of 100\u2013125 mg/dL\n- An OGTT two-hour blood glucose of 140\u2013199 mg/dL\nPreventing Type 2 Diabetes\nYou will not develop type 2 diabetes automatically if you have prediabetes. For some people with prediabetes, early treatment can actually return blood glucose levels to the normal range.\nResearch shows that you can lower your risk for type 2 diabetes by 58% by:\n- Losing 7% of your body weight (or 15 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds)\n- Exercising moderately (such as brisk walking) 30 minutes a day, five days a week\nDon't worry if you can't get to your ideal body weight. Losing even 10 to 15 pounds can make a huge difference."

      "text": "Type 2 Diabetes: What It Is, Causes, Symptoms & Treatment\nPeople living with type 2 diabetes face several significant health challenges.\nThe condition, which affects more than 10% of Americans, puts people at increased risk for debilitating medical issues like heart, kidney and eye damage, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK).\nTo help you get a handle on diabetes, this guide will explain what type 2 diabetes is, its key causes, symptoms to watch for and treatment options. It will also explain the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\nWhat is type 2 diabetes?\nA hormone called insulin, which is produced by your pancreas, is needed to help blood glucose (sugar) enter cells. There, glucose provides energy for numerous cellular functions, according to the NIDDK.\nIn type 2 diabetes, the cells have developed resistance to insulin, which causes the pancreas to produce more of it.\nType 1 versus type 2 diabetes: What\u2019s the difference?\nMayo Clinic endocrinologist Dr. Yogish Kudva noted in a clinic video that, while the exact cause of type 1 diabetes isn\u2019t known, \u201cwe believe that it is an autoimmune disorder where the body mistakenly destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.\u201d\nIn type 2 diabetes, these insulin-producing cells aren\u2019t destroyed. Instead, the main issue is insulin resistance.\nIs type 2 diabetes genetic?\nGenes play a role in the development of diabetes, according to the NIDDK. The institute was part of the largest diabetes genetics study to date in 2018, which was published in Nature Genetics. It involved nearly 900,000 participants and uncovered 400 additional gene markers associated with type 2 diabetes.\n\u201cThe truth is that type 2 diabetes is more than one thing. It is common to describe it as a social and behavioral disease, and your chances of developing type 2 diabetes are much lower if you practice a healthy lifestyle,\u201d said Dr. Jamil Alkhaddo, chief of endocrinology at the Allegheny Health Network in Canonsburg, Pa., in an interview for Highmark Health.\n\u201cThat\u2019s important -- it\u2019s just not the whole story,\u201d he continued. \u201cSomeone with multiple family members with diabetes is more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.\u201d\nWhat causes type 2 diabetes?\nType 2 diabetes is caused by multiple factors, according to the NIDDK, including:\nInsulin resistance\nExtra weight or obesity\nLack of exercise\nGenes\nIn a study conducted over two decades and published in Nature Medicine, researchers estimated that 70% of type 2 diabetes cases worldwide were primarily linked to three unhealthy dietary choices: overconsumption of processed meat, overconsumption of refined rice and wheat, and underconsumption of whole grains.\nType 2 diabetes symptoms\nSymptoms of diabetes may be mild or unnoticeable for many years, the NIDDK says. They include:\nExcessive thirst\nIncreased urination\nWorsening vision\nTingling and numbness in your hands and feet\nSores that won\u2019t heal\nWeight loss that you can\u2019t explain\nFatigue\nCan type 2 diabetes be reversed?\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really cure diabetes, but there is such a thing as diabetes remission,\" Alkhaddo said in his 2022 interview. \"If you\u2019re able to get off all diabetes medication and keep your A1C in a good range for six months or more, we call that diabetes remission.\"\nIn a separate interview for Bayhealth in Dover, Del., endocrinologist Dr. Nira Madisi said type 2 diabetes can often be effectively managed. \u201cIt\u2019s a condition that one has to live with every day, but making small changes can help,\u201d she said.\nType 2 diabetes treatment\nAlkhaddo pointed to three key factors.\n\u201cDiet, exercise and taking care of your mental health -- that\u2019s the tripod,\u201d he said.\nHe added that \u201cthese days, we have more medication options before we reach the stage of adding insulin, and many of the medications have a very promising impact.\u201d\nBesides different types of insulin, other type 2 diabetes medications work by helping with the production, release and absorption of insulin; by reducing the production of glucose, and by optimizing the use and release of glucose, according to the NIDDK and U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\nLiving with type 2 diabetes\nFor people living with diabetes type 2, Alkhaddo said regular blood sugar testing is a key to successful health outcomes.\nLiving with diabetes also means incorporating a few additional health-focused strategies into your daily routines. Madisi pointed to these as key:\nFollowing your medication schedule\nMinimizing sugar consumption\nFocusing on a type 2 diabetes diet rich in complex carbohydrates\nFitting in 150 minutes of exercise per week\nAvoiding sitting for extended periods\nLosing excess weight\nChecking your feet regularly for wounds\nManaging your mental and emotional health\nTo learn more, check out the American Diabetes Association\u2019s free Living with Type 2 Diabetes Program.\nWhat This Means For You\nMaking diabetes-focused strategies part of your everyday routine will help you manage type 2.\nFor more information on diabetes:\nUnderstanding Diabetes: What It Is, Types, Symptoms & Treatments\nPrediabetes: What You Need to Know About Its Causes, Symptoms & Treatment\nGestational Diabetes: What It Is, Causes, Symptoms & Treatment\nDiabetes Symptoms Vary by Type: Here's How to Tell the Difference\nWhat to Know About Alcohol and Diabetes, According to an Expert\nDiabetes Sick Day Rules: What to Eat, Drink & Do, According to an Expert"

  "argos_summary": "Researchers at Penn State have developed a breath\u2011based sensor that detects elevated acetone levels to distinguish people with type\u20112 diabetes from healthy individuals, showing a strong correlation with blood glucose. In a pilot study of 51 diabetics and 20 controls, the device could identify diabetes in minutes and may eventually allow continuous glucose monitoring without blood draws. The study highlights the potential for a simpler, non\u2011invasive diagnostic tool compared to current blood\u2011based tests such as A1C, fasting plasma glucose, and oral glucose tolerance tests. If validated, the technology could also aid in tracking glucose changes related to diet and exercise, complementing existing prevention and management strategies for prediabetes and type\u20112 diabetes.",
