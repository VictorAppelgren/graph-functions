  "title": "CBC Roundup: Congressman Marc Veasey (TX-33) - \"The game has changed baby.\"",
  "description": "Congressman\ufffd Marc Veasey \ufffdwas elected to\ufffd Texas 33rd Congressional District \ufffdin 2012,\ufffda majority minority district created by Federal order in 2012 . ...",
  "content": "Congressman Marc Veasey was elected to Texas 33rd Congressional District in 2012, a majority minority district created by Federal order in 2012. The last redistricting map, drawn and approved by Texas Republicans in 2021, which they called \u201ca beautiful map\u201d, left the district basically unchanged. The current redistricting threat in Texas, ordered by the mfg and being ramrodded by Governor Abbott and Republican Texas legislators, would decimate TX-33, creating a map for the Dallas-Fort Worth area, similar to that which was declared illegal in 2012 (see Congressman Veasey\u2019s testimony in the redistricting hearing posted below \u2014 the last video before the fold).\n\nNotably, in light of the current attacks on Texan\u2019s and by extension, all of our voting rights, Congressman Marc Veasey, is the founder of the Congressional Voting Rights Caucus.\n\nDuring his tenure, Congressman Veasey has been the sponsor of 2 bills enacted into law, sponsoring 8 bills to date in the 119th Congress. Rep. Marc Veasey serves on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and on the subcommittees of Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade, Energy, and Health, of that Committee. He also serves on the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (U.S. Helsinki Commission).\n\nWith Congressman Veasey\u2019s district being one of those targeted for redistricting by Republicans in Texas, he has been in the news since mid July.\n\nThis interview from July 12th provides a good background on the Texas redistricting coup. This is before the R\u2019s released their new map.\n\nHere\u2019s a good breakdown of the new map..\n\nCongressman Marc Veasey\u2019s testimony against gerrymandering in Texas from July 29th.\n\nCongressman Marc Veasey\u2019s testimony at a Texas redistricting hearing on August 2nd. Congressman Al Green testified also, including testimony about Texas\u2019 long history of racist gerrymandering and correcting the record as to previous court rulings, that have been twisted and misrepresented by R\u2019s (TX-9 which Rep. Al Green represents, is effectively eliminated in the new map). Congressman Veasey\u2019s testimony provides important historical background about the creation of TX-33. I encourage everyone to watch the full video.\n\n(See below the fold for more appearances by Congressman Marc Veasey in the news this week).\n\nThis Week\u2019s News From the CBC\n\nThere were 5 meetings in the Senate.\n\nThe Senate confirmed 5 of the mfg\u2019s nominees. Senators Alsobrooks, Blunt Rochester, Booker and Warnock voted Nay on all of them.\n\nThe Senate confirmed 5 of the mfg\u2019s nominees, Senators Alsobrooks, Blunt Rochester, Booker and Warnock all voting Nay to all of the nominees. The Senate also passed H.R. 3944 (Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2026) (87/9/4) and an amendment to \u201cimprove the bill\u201d (81/15/4). Senators Alsobrooks, Blunt Rochester and Warnock voted Yea on H.R. 3944; Senator Booker voted Nay. Senators Alsobrooks, Blunt Rochester, Booker and Warnock all voted Yea on the amendment.\n\nThe Senate confirmed 10 of the mfg\u2019s nominees, including Jeanine Pirro to be US Attorney for the District of Columbia. With the exceptions of Luke Lindberg, Adam Telle and Marcus Molinaro, Senators Alsobrooks, Blunt Rochester, Booker and Warnock voted Nay on all of them. Senator Warnock voted Yea for Luke Lindberg to be Undersecretary of Agriculture for Trade and Foreign Affairs in a 78/17/5 vote. Senators Alsobrooks and Warnock voted Yea for Adam Telle to be Assistant Secretary of the Army in a 72/22/6 vote. Senators Alsobrooks and Warnock voted Yea for Marcus Molinaro to be Federal Transit Administrator in a 71/23/6 vote.\n\nCongress is now in recess until September 2nd\n\nPress conference with Congresswoman Robin Kelly, Texas State Representatives and Congressman Al Green, Congressman Marc Veasey and Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett.\n\nMembers of the CBC marked the 60th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, calling for the passage of the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act and other acts to protect voting rights.\n\nReminder: CBC Roundup is a weekly series, published on Thursdays at 9 AM ET. Members of the CBC are on the frontlines of defending our democracy, so please share widely. For daily updates, please see my CBC comments in the Abbreviated Pundit Roundup.",

We are concerned that this relationship with agents having close connections to our primary adversary jeopardizes our data and our national security,\u201d said Chairmen Guthrie and Bilirakis. \u201cTo ensure Americans and their businesses are secure from foreign interference, we are launching this investigation into DeepSeek and the risks it poses to our nation.\u201d KEY LETTER EXCERPT: \u201cBy its own admission, the company\u2019s mobile application\u2014available on app stores in the U.S.\u2014is sending Americans\u2019 personal information to servers in the People\u2019s Republic of China. According to media reports, the company is also sharing users\u2019 personal information with other CCP-linked entities, including ByteDance Ltd. Researchers, meanwhile, have identified serious weaknesses in DeepSeek\u2019s purported security controls and model safeguards. To address these risks, a growing number of states, including New York, Texas, and Virginia have banned DeepSeek on government devices, with states attorneys-general calling for a broader ban.\u201d Background: On January 20, 2025, DeepSeek launched its open-source AI chatbot. On February 18, 2025, DeepSeek was accused of sharing user data with ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok. On March 6, 2025, 21 state attorneys-general urged Congressional leadership to prohibit government devices from \u201cdownloading and using the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s DeepSeek AI Software.\u201d On April 16, 2025, the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party published a report on DeepSeek funneling American data to the CCP and manipulating results to align with CCP propaganda. The Committee members requested answers to the following questions: Provide a detailed description of the types and sources of data used to train your AI models, including any U.S. personal or proprietary information. Confirm whether information entered into your AI applications or chatbots by American consumers or businesses is used to train your AI models. If yes, identify where this information is stored and accessed from, and whether it is shared with any state entity of the People\u2019s Republic of China or other Chinese companies. Describe the technical, administrative, and physical controls used to secure personal and proprietary information associated with your AI offerings, as well as your process for evaluating the security of third-party service providers. Provide a detailed description of any U.S. technology products or services used to develop, integrate, or bring to market your AI offerings. This includes the use of open and closed source AI models developed by U.S. companies and the unauthorized \u201cdistillation\u201d of American models. Provide a detailed description of how your AI models are developed and trained, including any steps taken to influence system outputs for alignment with Chinese Communist Party ideology or political goals. Provide a detailed description of any direct or indirect subsidies you receive from the People\u2019s Republic of China, or its political subdivisions, related to AI development. Confirm whether your company has received a request from the People\u2019s Republic of China, or its political subdivisions, for data related to your company\u2019s AI offerings.

KEY EXCERPT: \u201cAccording to 23andMe\u2019s privacy statement, in a bankruptcy, customers\u2019 \u2018Personal Information may be accessed, sold or transferred as part of that transaction and this Privacy Statement will apply to [customer] Personal Information as transferred to the new entity.\u2019 Additionally, a judge recently ruled 23andMe has the right to sell the sensitive medical and genetic information of its 15 million customers, which is considered to be the company\u2019s most valuable asset. With the lack of a federal comprehensive data privacy and security law, we write to express our great concern about the safety of Americans\u2019 most sensitive personal information.\u201d Background: On March 23, 2025, 23andMe initiated Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, which could have ramifications for the highly sensitive information of millions of Americans. While Americans\u2019 personal health information is protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), these protections only apply if the information is collected by a HIPAA covered entity. Generally, direct-to-consumer companies, like 23andMe, are not covered by HIPAA. Customers have reported issues accessing and deleting their data from their 23andMe accounts. The Chairmen have requested answers to the following questions: If 23andMe were to sell the personal information of its customers either as a standalone asset or as part of a broader sale of the company, what post-sale data privacy and security protections would be in place for its customers\u2019 personal information? Please describe how the representations made in 23andMe\u2019s privacy statement will continue to apply\u2014and be enforced\u2014if the personal information of 23andMe\u2019s customers is sold to a third party. Please include in this response information about what, if anything, would hold a third-party buyer to 23andMe\u2019s privacy statement or prevent it from subsequently using, transferring, or otherwise selling, such information in the future. Does 23andMe plan to change its privacy statement at any time prior to selling any customers\u2019 personal information? If so, please explain the change 23andMe plans to implement and when those changes will go into effect. Does 23andMe intend to vet prospective buyers to which it may sell its customers\u2019 personal information? If so, please detail the vetting process and whether it will include the prospective buyer\u2019s history of implementing data security protections and compliance with sectoral, state, or any other data privacy and security laws. If not, please explain why. Please detail the categories of customer information 23andMe has, and of that what 23andMe is considering selling. Has 23andMe notified its customers of the company\u2019s bankruptcy announcement? If so, please attach the customer notification. If not, please explain why. Has 23andMe provided its customers with a guide for how to delete, or request to delete any information currently in 23andMe\u2019s possession? If so, please provide a copy of that guide and specify when it was provided to customers. If not, please explain why, and explain whether 23andMe will contact each of its customers and provide an opportunity to delete their personal information prior to a potential sale of the company or personal information maintained by the company. Please detail the number of requests 23andMe received from its customers to delete their personal information between when 23andMe filed for bankruptcy and the date of the response to this letter. Of those requests, please provide a breakdown of how many requests were made by customers through their 23andMe online accounts and how many were made via customer service calls because customers were unable to successfully delete their information through their online accounts. Of those requests, please detail the number of fulfilled requests. Will 23andMe offer for sale any information in which a customer has requested the deletion of such information? If so, does 23andMe\u2019s privacy policy consider selling information a legitimate purpose for retaining information past a customer's request to delete their information? Will 23andMe deidentify its customers\u2019 personal information prior to selling it or the company? If so, please detail which information will be deidentified. If not, please explain why the company is electing not to deidentify information. CLICK HERE to read the full letter.

      "text": "Chairman Guthrie Op-Ed: Here\u2019s the Truth: The One Big, Beautiful Bill Actually Strengthens Medicaid\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 The following op-ed by Congressman Brett Guthrie (KY-02), Chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, appeared in the Courier Journal this week. \u201cEarlier this year, President Trump tasked Congress with developing a bill that enacts his domestic policy agenda and kickstarts the American economy. \u201cThis piece of legislation, known as the One Big, Beautiful Bill, was signed into law by the president on July 4, 2025. It accomplished its goal of providing tax relief for Kentucky families, securing our border, investing in our military readiness, unleashing American energy and strengthening Medicaid for our most vulnerable Americans. \u201cIn Congress, I am honored to serve as the chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. At the onset of the work on the One Big, Beautiful Bill, we were tasked with finding $880 billion in savings from our committee\u2019s jurisdiction. \u201cThe final version of the One Big, Beautiful Bill includes over $1 trillion in savings from my committee\u2019s jurisdiction. To accomplish this, we worked to eliminate reckless Green New Deal environmental regulations, promote American energy dominance and eliminate waste, fraud and abuse within the Medicaid program. \u201cAs you may have seen in the news over the past few weeks, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have spread misinformation about this bill, claiming that it is a disaster for Kentucky families. That\u2019s simply untrue. \u201cLet\u2019s take a moment to address a few of the false narratives that have been spread to scare the American people. \u201c Truth and lies about the One Big, Beautiful Bill and Medicaid \u201c Allegation : Single mothers, children, seniors and people with disabilities will lose access to health care. \u201c Truth : The Medicaid provisions included in the One, Big Beautiful Bill ensure our most vulnerable Americans continue receiving the support they need. It strengthens the program by removing deceased recipients from the Medicaid rolls, requiring states to conduct more frequent eligibility checks for the expansion population, ensuring that individuals are not enrolled in multiple states and enacting commonsense work requirements for able-bodied Americans who choose not to work. Additionally, our bill expands access to Home and Community Based Services for low-income seniors and individuals living with a disability. \u201c Allegation : Work requirements are a \u2018ruse\u2019 to force people off Medicaid. \u201c Truth : According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, there are 4.8 million able-bodied adults currently on Medicaid who choose not to work. A survey showed this population spends roughly 184 hours a month watching television and socializing- that\u2019s 50% higher than employed beneficiaries. \u201cOur bill enacts basic work requirements to require individuals to be employed, participate in job training, go to school or volunteer in their communities for just 20 hours per week to receive Medicaid. Notably, the One Big, Beautiful Bill exempts people aged under 19 or over 65, pregnant women, tribal members, caregivers of children and seniors with disabilities and parents with dependents under 15. I believe most people would agree it\u2019s appropriate to expect able-bodied, unemployed adults on Medicaid to work or give back to their communities to receive fully subsidized health insurance. \u201cKentuckians\u2019 support for these policies is strong, as this year, the Kentucky General Assembly voted overwhelmingly to overturn Gov. Andy Beshear\u2019s veto and institute a similar state-level work requirement. \u201c Allegation : Over 35 Kentucky hospitals are at risk of closing as a direct result of this bill. \u201c Truth : The allegation that 35 rural hospitals will close is a blatant mischaracterization at best. This number stems from a list of hospitals that generally receive high levels of Medicaid funding or experienced three consecutive years of negative total profit margin. \u201cThis claim fails to mention the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program created by the bill to support rural health providers care for their patients. This will bolster funding for our most vulnerable hospitals and allow them to keep serving their communities. \u201c Trump\u2019s bill refocuses Medicaid to cover the most vulnerable \u201cOur legislation eliminates restrictive Biden-Harris era state requirements, forcing ineligible individuals to remain enrolled, and lifts Americans out of poverty by encouraging reentry into the workforce. By cutting top-down mandates, we refocus Medicaid dollars to cover the most vulnerable and give states\u2019 budgets the ability to further invest in hospitals. \u201cSpending in the Medicaid program continues to chart an unsustainable path, growing at twice the rate of inflation between 2018 and 2023. If not addressed, the program will no longer have the capacity to serve its intended purpose. In order to preserve this safety net for generations to come, Republicans have committed to policies that empower states to care for our most vulnerable Americans \u2014 pregnant women, children, individuals living with a disability and low-income seniors. \u201cThe One Big, Beautiful Bill is a commonsense win that strengthens Medicaid for Kentucky\u2019s most vulnerable, and I\u2019m proud to have supported its passage.\u201d ###"

      "text": "Subcommittee on Energy Holds Hearing on Pipeline Safety\nWASHINGTON, D.C. \u2013 Yesterday, Congressman Bob Latta (OH-05), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy, led a hearing titled Strengthening American Energy: A Review of Pipeline Safety Policy. \u201cPipelines are not only vital for the safe transportation of the reliable energy that Americans rely upon, but they will continue to ensure our nation\u2019s energy dominance,\u201d said Chairman Latta . \u201c Today\u2019s hearing offered the opportunity to address multiple issues including rule making for the PIPES Act, closing penalty loopholes for pipeline vandalism, and examining ways that certain technologies, like AI, can be used to increase efficiencies in the pipeline system.\" Watch the full hearing here . Below are key excerpts from today\u2019s hearing: Congressman August Pfluger (TX-11): \u201cWould you agree that if we\u2019re going to meet the rising demand, while also keeping the lights on, that we need to get serious about modernizing and expanding our natural gas infrastructure?\u201d Mr. Moriarty: \u201c Yes, I would agree with that. Natural gas pipelines are the safest way to move the energy that this nation needs. And there\u2019s ever more demand for energy across our surface territories, which is the United States. And to meet those demands, we need to construct and safely operate pipelines as well as LNG storage facilities.\u201d Congresswoman Laurel Lee (FL-15): \u201cMr. Moriarty, you mentioned that one of the top risks you perceive for pipeline safety is in fact cybersecurity. Would you share with us a bit more about the cyber threat landscape you are seeing and how you\u2019re partnering with federal agencies like the FBI and CISA to meet that threat?\u201d Mr. Moriarty: \u201c Because of the cyber threat, we took our SCADA system, which is responsible for the safe operations of our systems, off our corporate system and we put it into what we call a DMZ zone, which means nobody can get access to it. So, even if there is a breach somewhere on our system, it won\u2019t get into the pipeline safe operation. Every day, we have threats we have a scoreboard where we see threats coming in in real time. Because of the investments we have made, most of those are stopped before they become a real threat.\u201d Congressman Rick Allen (GA-12): \u201cBuilding up our pipeline capacity is critical to delivering affordable energy to our constituents across the country and our allies. We\u2019ve heard from the witnesses that pipelines are the safest way to deliver energy. As we are working on modernizing the role of Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration, it is critical we ensure it works to enhance our pipeline infrastructure.\u201d ###"

He is a founding member of the Congressional Voting Rights Caucus and has sponsored multiple bills during his tenure, focusing on issues like voting rights and healthcare. Veasey's district has been in the news due to proposed changes that echo past illegal gerrymandering practices, prompting his testimonies against such actions.",
