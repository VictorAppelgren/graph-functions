  "title": "Israel declares Gaza\u2019s largest city a combat zone as death toll surpasses 63,000",
  "description": "The Gaza Health Ministry says the death toll in Gaza has surpassed 63,000 as Palestinians face the start of Israel\u2019s expanded offensive in Gaza City.",
  "content": "The shift comes weeks after Israel first announced plans to widen its offensive in the city, where hundreds of thousands are sheltering while enduring famine. In recent days, the military has ramped up strikes on the city\u2019s outskirts.\n\nAs the military announced the resumption of fighting, health officials said the death toll in Gaza has risen to 63,025, with 59 deaths reported by hospitals over the last 24 hours. Aid groups and a church sheltering people said they would stay in Gaza City, refusing to abandon the hungry and displaced.\n\nGAZA CITY, Gaza Strip \u2014 Israel declared Gaza\u2019s largest city a combat zone and recovered the remains of two hostages on Friday as the army launched the start of a planned offensive that has drawn international condemnation.\n\nPlumes of smoke and thunderous blasts could be seen and heard across the border in southern Israel on Friday morning.\n\nIsrael has called Gaza City a Hamas stronghold, alleging that a network of tunnels remain in use despite several previous large-scale raids on the area throughout nearly 23 months of war.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Israel needs to cripple Hamas\u2019s capabilities in the city to avoid a repeat of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that ignited the war.\n\nWhile United Nations agencies and aid groups condemned the offensive, people in Gaza City said it made little difference.\n\n\u201cThe massacres never stopped, even during the humanitarian pauses,\u201d resident Mohamed Aboul Hadi said in a text message from Gaza City.\n\nSome who fled south were putting together tents Friday in the central Gaza Strip, west of the Nuseirat refugee camp. They spoke of the miserable conditions they have endured.\n\n\u201cWe are thrown in the streets like, what would I say? Like dogs? We are not like dogs. Dogs are better than us,\u201d said Mohammed Maarouf standing in front of a shelter for him and his family of nine.\n\nMore than 63,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war started, the Gaza Health Ministry said Friday. The ministry\u2019s count \u2014 63,025 \u2014 does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. It also said five people had died from malnutrition-related causes over the past 24 hours, raising the toll to 322, including 121 children, since the war began.\n\nThe ministry is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. The UN and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on war casualties. Israel disputes its figures but has not provided its own.\n\nFacing international criticism, Israel instituted what it called \u201ctactical pauses\u201d in Gaza City and two other populated areas last month. That paused fighting from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. to allow more aid to get through, though aid groups have said deliveries remained challenging because of blockade, looting, and Israeli restrictions.\n\nMidday Friday, the military changed course, marking the latest escalation after weeks of preparatory strikes in some of the city\u2019s neighborhoods and calling up tens of thousands of reservists.\n\n\u201cWe will intensify our strikes until we bring back all the kidnapped hostages and dismantle Hamas,\u201d said Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee, who urged Palestinians in Gaza City to flee south, calling evacuation \u201cinevitable.\u201d\n\nHundreds of residents began that journey on Friday, piling their few remaining possessions onto pickup trucks or donkey carts. Many have been forced to leave their homes more than once.\n\nThe UN said Thursday that 23,000 people had evacuated this past week, but many in Gaza City say there is nowhere safe to go.\n\n\u201cWe cannot find any place in the west nor in the south. Conditions are difficult. Where are we going? We don\u2019t know,\u201d said Saddam Yazigi as he prepared to leave.\n\nAbout 440 people sheltering at the Holy Family Church of Gaza City planned to remain there, along with clergy assisting them, although the church has few defenses.\n\n\u201cWhen we feel danger, people get closer to the walls or whatever, it\u2019s more protected,\u201d Farid Jubran told The Associated Press.\n\nThe UN\u2019s humanitarian agency also planned to keep its staff and NGOs on the ground.\n\nThe Israeli military did not say whether it had notified residents or aid groups of its plans to resume daytime fighting before Friday\u2019s 11:30 a.m. announcement.\n\nThe Norwegian Refugee Council, which coordinates a coalition of aid groups in Gaza, said it had no advance notice. The UN feared the area could lose half of its hospital bed capacity.\n\n\u201cWe cannot provide health services to 2 million people besieged in the south,\u201d said Zaher al-Wahidi, a spokesperson for Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry.\n\nThe renewed attacks also come a week after the world\u2019s leading food security authority declared a famine in Gaza City.\n\nAn Israeli military official said Israel would keep trying to facilitate aid delivery, but offered no details on how they might accomplish that amid the fighting.\n\n\u201cThis will have a horrific impact on people already exhausted, malnourished, bereaved, displaced, and deprived of basics needed for survival,\u201d the UN\u2019s humanitarian agency said in a statement.\n\nIsrael on Friday said its military had recovered the remains of two hostages \u2014 Ilan Weiss and another left unnamed.\n\n\u201cWe will not rest or be silent until we return all of our hostages home \u2014 both the living and the dead,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\nAbu Obeida, a spokesperson for Hamas\u2019s armed wing, said fighters in Gaza City were ready. He said the group would try to keep the hostages alive, but said fighting is expected in the areas where they are being held.\n\nWeiss, 55, was killed in the attack on Kibbutz Be\u2019eri, one of the communities near Gaza that was stormed on Oct. 7.\n\nFor the families, the return of remains brings some closure, but also a reminder of the hostages still being held.\n\n\u201cAt least they have closure,\u201d said Rubi Chen, whose son was abducted during the Oct. 7 attack and is believed to be dead. \u201cThere are still 49 families waiting to have that closure.\u201d\n\nNearly 50 of the 251 hostages remain in Gaza, including 20 thought by Israel to be alive. Militants also killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack. Most of the hostages have been released in cease-fires or other deals.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which has organized large-scale protests demanding a cease-fire to return the hostages, said Israeli leaders should prioritize a deal to return both the living and the dead.\n\n\u201cWe call on the Israeli government to enter negotiations and stay at the table until every last hostage comes home. Time is running out,\u201d it said in a statement.",
