  "content": "The Milwaukee Brewers scored early and often against the Pittsburgh Pirates and ace Paul Skenes, routing Pittsburgh 14-0 to extend their win streak to a league-leading 11 games. At 75-44, Milwaukee has quickly become far and away MLB\u2019s best team, five games better than the next-closest club.\n\nLeadoff hitter Sal Frelick got the scoring started in the first inning on a full-count home run, and things quickly unraveled for Skenes from there. The 2024 National League rookie of the year lasted just four innings, allowing four runs on six hits and 93 pitches.\n\nThe Pirates\u2019 relief corps wasn\u2019t much better, allowing an additional 10 runs over the remaining four innings, including a three-run homer from Andrew Vaughn in the sixth before ultimately conceding the game with a position player on the mound.\n\nFor his part, Freddy Peralta tossed six scoreless innings with seven strikeouts, lowering his ERA to 2.90. Milwaukee then deployed Grant Anderson, Aaron Ashby and utilityman Anthony Seigler to seal the win, pushing its lead in the NL Central to 7 1/2 games over the Chicago Cubs.\n\nIf some of that sounds familiar to Brewers fans, that\u2019s because it eerily is. Tuesday\u2019s start tied for Skenes\u2019 second-shortest outing of the 2025 campaign, and his four earned runs are the second most he has permitted all season. On June 25, Skenes also lasted just four innings and allowed four runs, against none other than these same Brewers.\n\nNot only have the Brewers rocked Skenes once before, but this is also Milwaukee\u2019s second win streak of 11 games this season, having won 11 straight from July 6 to July 21. With two separate win streaks of at least 10 games in the same season, the Brewers became the 10th team in MLB history to accomplish the feat. Of the nine previous teams to reach that mark, three made it to the World Series.",
