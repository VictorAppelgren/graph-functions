Unfortunately, at that point, the gator was pretty wary of individuals. I got pretty close, but the gator took off into the lily pads,\" Asplundh said.\n\nAt that point, he left and bought a headlamp before returning to the lake.\n\n\"Then I snuck into the lily pads after him,\" Asplundh said. That second attempt turned out to be a success.\n\nHe is set to meet with wildlife officials on Friday and is hoping for clearance to take the gator to his sanctuary.\n\nOn Thursday, Bristol Township police warned residents to stay out of the lake and the nearby Mill Creek until the Pennsylvania Game Commission could deal with the gator. That was before Asplundh got involved.\n\nThis isn't the first Philadelphia-area gator that Asplundh has dealt with. In 2023, an 8-foot alligator named \"Big Mack\" was found in a Philly rowhome. Asplundh says he brought Big Mack back to his sanctuary and he's doing well.\n\nAsplundh says families often buy gators as pets but abandon them once they become too big.\n\nWe'll follow up to see what's next for this gator.",

      "text": "ACCT Philly removes 8-foot alligator \"Big Mack\" from home\nPHILADELPHIA (CBS) -- An 8-foot alligator named Big Mack was rescued from a North Philadelphia row home by ACCT Philly. Big Mack is the Philadelphia animal shelter's third gator rescued just this month.\nThis is the day when North Philadelphia resident Yali says \"See ya later, alligator,\" literally.\n\"My husband had him since 2011,\" Yali said. \"We've had him all these years, been in the basement.\"\nLocked in this makeshift enclosure, this alligator used to be little, but it grew to 8 feet, 127 pounds, and now that Yali and her soon-to-be ex-husband have grown apart.\n\"I wanted him out of here,\" Yali said.\nSo she called ACCT Philly to find Big Mack a new home.\nAfter wrestling Big Mack out of his enclosure, animal protection officers began to tie him up and remove him from the basement. It took three people to carry Big Mack.\n\"Hopefully, you find a nice home for him,\" Yali said.\nBig Mack's home, for now, is ACCT Philly's shelter.\nThis is the third alligator the shelter's taken in just this month.\nExecutive director Sarah Barnett says Big Mack was supposed to go to a sanctuary in Michigan, but he's too large for the plane they secured. They're now looking at local options.\n\"We're going to find placement for him,\" Barnett said. \"That's going to give him the space and the care that he needs.\"\nAnd allowing ACCT Philly to eventually say, \"See ya later alligator.\"\nIt is illegal in Philadelphia to own an exotic animal with a propensity to be dangerous, but ACCT Philly says it won't pursue any criminal charges. They say they'd rather people reach out for assistance instead of being punished."
