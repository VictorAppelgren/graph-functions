  "description": "SEO at scale requires more than local know-how. Here\u2019s how to structure global teams, processes, and tools for consistent performance.",
  "content": "Global companies today face a paradox. Search is more important than ever, yet how it\u2019s managed across markets is often inconsistent, inefficient, and misaligned with broader digital goals.\n\nToo often, SEO is seen as a localized effort, tactically delegated to regional teams or outsourced agencies.\n\nWhile local knowledge is critical, international SEO success demands structure, governance, and repeatable processes. Otherwise, companies waste resources, duplicate efforts, and fail to capitalize on scalable gains.\n\nThis article offers a blueprint for designing an effective SEO organizational structure for global companies, rooted in real-world service-level governance.\n\nWe\u2019ll explore what to centralize, what to localize, and how to balance best practices with market nuance.\n\nDrawing from the Service Level Agreement (SLA)-based SEO model used at leading enterprises, we\u2019ll break down the building blocks of a successful international SEO operation, from key performance indicators (KPIs) and tooling to budget models and agency management.\n\nWhat To Centralize Vs. Localize\n\nAn effective SEO structure isn\u2019t just about resourcing; it\u2019s about allocation logic. Knowing which tasks belong at corporate, brand, or market levels prevents duplication, preserves strategic clarity, and empowers those closest to the customer.\n\nThis may be one of the most challenging aspects of international SEO operations, particularly for decentralized organizations. You\u2019ll need to evaluate what must be done at each level thoughtfully.\n\nConsider where content is created, how websites are maintained, how diverse market content truly is, and how mature your localization process is.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no one-size-fits-all solution, not even a \u201cone-size-fits-most\u201d option. Each organization must assess its structure, workflows, and existing capabilities.\n\nIn many cases, it\u2019s advisable to begin with a few uncontroversial initiatives, such as aligning on what is already established in brand or web standards, content themes, topical coverage, and entity research, and establishing consistent reporting.\n\nOnce those foundational elements are in place, you can move toward more sensitive and territorial elements such as Webmaster Tools account management, diagnostic methodology standardization, and global governance of webpage templates.\n\nThese activities are best housed within a corporate SEO function or Center of Excellence (CoE), where scale, tooling, and data access are leveraged across the enterprise:\n\u2022 Training and enablement of brand and market teams.\n\nSome functions require cross-functional collaboration between the brand/business unit and central teams:\n\nLocalization is more than just translation. Market teams need autonomy in areas that require cultural fluency, deep customer knowledge, and search behavior insight:\n\nWhen Not To Localize\n\nNot all localization adds value. Avoid local divergence when:\n\u2022 The same product or offer is consistent across regions.\n\nTo succeed at scale, international SEO must rely on shared standards that create consistency and reduce avoidable errors.\n\nStandardization accelerates execution and allows for cross-market insights.\n\u2022 SEO Training Curriculum: Modular training by role type, from content creators to developers.\n\u2022 Governance Reviews: Scheduled audits of adherence to SEO standards by markets and BUs.\n\nStandardization doesn\u2019t mean rigidity. It means creating a foundation that enables innovation and agility at the local level while preserving enterprise-wide integrity.\n\nKPIs That Matter At Each Level\n\nMetrics must reflect both operational performance and business impact, and be meaningful at each layer of the organization.\n\nIn one real-world example, a company managing SEO through multiple agencies across markets experienced significant inefficiencies due to inconsistent reporting standards.\n\nRegional and global teams were forced to spend time reconciling disparate metrics, definitions, and formats.\n\nEnforcing consistent KPIs and using standardized reporting templates eliminated this wasted effort, freeing up time for analysis and action rather than reconciliation.\n\nIf data collection and presentation are consistent, it is easy to roll up data across markets and business units to see the total impact on the business, opportunities, and problems.\n\nConsistent and business-oriented metrics are critical to making the business case for continued funding and support of your initiatives.\n\nEnsure KPIs are actionable, standardized across teams and markets, and demonstrate business value to stakeholders.\n\nClearly defined processes eliminate ambiguity and ensure that SEO deliverables happen on time and with quality.\n\nSLAs are formal commitments defining expected service levels, responsibilities, and response times across collaborating teams.\n\nAs organizations mature in their SEO operations, introducing SLAs becomes essential, especially when coordinating between global, brand, and market-level stakeholders.\n\nFor example, suppose a global or brand team is responsible for actions that impact a lower level, such as a local market. In that case, those responsibilities must be documented and bound to SLA metrics.\n\nThis not only clarifies accountability but reinforces cross-functional support. Consider a global product launch: If the worldwide team owns the standardized topic taxonomy, it must be delivered to local markets in time for localization and adaptation.\n\nFailure to meet these timeframes puts pressure on markets at launch and risks missed visibility. An SLA helps prevent this by enforcing alignment through timelines and accountability.\n\u2022 Defined Turnaround Times: For topical or taxonomy research, page audits, and performance reporting.\n\u2022 Quarterly Review Cadence: For content clusters, PLPs, and editorial integration.\n\u2022 Feedback Loops: Structured inputs from local teams into topic and content models and optimization cycles.\n\nAll SLAs should be clearly documented and agreed upon by both internal stakeholders and external agency partners. This alignment ensures that expectations are mutually understood and that accountability is shared.\n\nIn addition, a defined escalation process, covering both operational delays and performance disputes, must be in place and visible across all participants in the SEO workflow.\n\nProcess governance should be transparent, with clear ownership between corporate, brand, and local roles.\n\nThe proper tool structure minimizes duplication, improves time-to-insight, and supports efficient SEO workflows, yet it does not impede any unique requirements at market levels.\n\u2022 Centralized Tool Procurement: Licensing enterprise-grade platforms at scale and using automation or appropriate seat licenses for brands and markets.\n\u2022 Integration With Tech Stack: SEO tools integrated into content management system (CMS), digital asset management (DAM), analytics, and campaign platforms.\n\u2022 Local Adaptation Guidelines: Empower markets to use supplementary tools while maintaining reporting standards.\n\nTools should be centrally funded to ensure consistency, leverage volume-based pricing, and simplify vendor relationships.\n\nWhen centralized funding is not feasible, a \u201ctin cup\u201d model may be used, with markets contributing based on utilization and need. This hybrid approach helps ensure broad access to necessary tools while aligning budgets to value creation.\n\nA real-world example underscores the importance of strategic tooling governance. In one organization, the enterprise licensed a powerful SEO diagnostic platform, but with a cap on the number of URLs that could be crawled.\n\nSince U.S.-based teams initiated most crawls, smaller markets were often excluded due to exhausted crawl credits.\n\nThis led to a lack of visibility into localized issues, missed global diagnostic signals, and an inability to surface SEO problems across the full portfolio.\n\nOrganizations must ensure tooling limits don\u2019t inadvertently prioritize one region over another and that diagnostic equity is built into global processes.\n\nA key benefit of adopting a three-level management structure aligned to global and local goals is the ability to accurately identify actual resource needs.\n\nThis structure helps link local execution to global outcomes, providing the data and justification needed to support budget requests.\n\nWhen budget allocation aligns with tactical needs and enterprise goals, securing executive sponsorship and scaling successful models becomes easier.\n\u2022 Joint-Funded Pilots: CoE co-invests with business units to explore new opportunities.\n\u2022 ROI Justification Models: Frameworks to link SEO investment to lead gen, conversion uplift, and efficiency gains.\n\nInternational SEO execution often depends on external support, but market inconsistency can erode gains.\n\nA lack of coordination in one multinational SEO initiative involving multiple agencies led to numerous tickets being submitted for nearly identical issues.\n\nSome tickets addressed the same problem using different approaches, while others attempted to undo recently completed work based on alternate recommendations from a local agency.\n\nThis fragmentation caused unnecessary backlog, confusion, and frustration, highlighting the need for strong alignment on how SEO issues and changes are approached.\n\nKey guidelines may be integrated directly into contracts with external partners. One proven approach references the corporate SEO Center of Excellence playbooks, brand-specific standards, and Google\u2019s SEO fundamentals as foundational compliance requirements.\n\nThese guidelines should be codified in contractual language, with a clause stating that any unapproved deviations will be corrected at the partner\u2019s expense.\n\nThis ensures that new websites, SEO experiments, or localization practices do not introduce non-compliant structures or technical risks without visibility and alignment.\n\u2022 Onboarding Templates: Playbooks for briefing agencies on brand voice, workflows, and KPIs.\n\u2022 SEO Task Scoping Tools: Templates for briefs, content, and searcher interest research requests, and content updates.\n\nWith effective agency governance, local teams can move fast, without compromising quality or consistency.\n\nA successful shift to an international SEO structure requires staged planning and executive alignment.\n\nThe saying goes that Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day, and neither will your global search program be. However, the framework outlined here provides a structured starting point.\n\nWith the accelerating change in AI-driven search, having a uniform and consistent process that is well integrated across marketing, development, content creation, and all teams responsible for visibility and engagement is critical for future success.\n\u2022 Stakeholder Interviews: Capture local challenges, needs, and barriers to change.\n\u2022 Current-State Coverage Map: Understand what is done, where, by whom.\n\u2022 Pilot Programs: Test governance, SLA models, and tooling structures with one region or BU.\n\u2022 Training & Change Management: Ongoing enablement to embed new practices and workflows.\n\nAs search becomes more multimodal and AI-driven, companies can no longer afford disjointed SEO practices.\n\nA strong SEO organizational structure balances strategy and execution, global alignment and local nuance, standardization and innovation.\n\nBy embracing a service-level model, aligning KPIs to business outcomes, and establishing clear governance, global enterprises can:\n\nUltimately, SEO becomes not just a marketing function but a critical enabler of digital growth and global value creation.\n\u2022 Scaling Up: How To Expand Your SEO Services To New Markets",

      "text": "In today\u2019s interconnected digital world, international SEO is no longer optional for businesses with global ambitions \u2013 it is essential.\nThe potential to reach diverse markets and accelerate growth through optimized online presence in different countries is significant.\nBut simply having a global website isn\u2019t enough. To succeed internationally, your website must be competitive in each local market.\nThis guide provides an updated overview of the key considerations when embarking on an international SEO strategy.\nThe Difference Between International And Standard SEO\nFundamentally, SEO for a new market is the same as SEO for your home market, but unique complexities arise when expanding into global markets. These include:\n- Language Variations: Each market speaks its own language \u2013 sometimes quite literally. Proper localization and cultural nuances are critical to engaging the local consumer.\n- Multiple Websites: Due to legal, cultural, or engagement requirements, you may need distinct websites or sections for different countries.\n- Local Search Engines: Google dominates globally, but regional search engines like Baidu (China), Yandex (Russia), and Naver (South Korea) also play critical roles in certain markets.\n- Local Competitors & Audience: Your local competition is just as fierce as your global competition. Understanding user preferences in each market is key to gaining traction.\n- Cross-Market Competition: While you pay attention to each site, you must keep an eye on the overall performance when you have global websites. Otherwise, your local market websites may be competing against each other or, in the worst case, may not be indexed at all.\nFailing to account for these differences can result in costly mistakes.\nFor example, your Mexico-targeted site outranks your Spain-focused site, or worse, your site does not appear in local searches at all due to technical missteps with hreflang or canonical tags.\nSelecting linguistically correct phrases over a more popular phrase may result in significant missed opportunities.\nShould You Go Global? Evaluating Market Opportunity\nBefore committing to international SEO, it\u2019s essential to identify the right markets from not only a search demand perspective but also for ease of doing business, tariffs, and internet adoption. Key resources to guide this decision include:\n- Government and Trade Data: Websites like Trade.gov or WTO.org provide critical market and trade information.\n- Global Internet Usage Reports: Leverage data from McKinsey, eMarketer, or Internet World Stats to assess online penetration and growth trends in various regions.\n- Your Existing Website Analytics: Pay attention to organic traffic from foreign markets. If certain countries are already driving traffic and conversions, these should be prioritized.\n- Google Search Console: It is a rich source of opportunity identification using the performance report to identify target countries especially those where Google has translated your SERP snippet and page into the local language.\nBy leveraging both external reports and your internal data, you can make informed decisions on where your global SEO investments will drive the most growth.\nGlobal Strategy: One Website Or Multiple Websites?\nWhen the market potential, business structure, or cultural nuance justifies it, separate websites for each country offer clear advantages.\nThese include the ability to tailor design, content, merchandising, and SEO specifically for each market.\nHowever, building and maintaining multiple sites is resource-intensive, and not always feasible initially.\nFor companies testing new markets, a multilingual site using a language-only approach and hreflang tags to specify the target languages and countries is often a good starting point.\nAs market presence grows, the transition to country-specific websites becomes more beneficial for both SEO and user experience.\nWhat Domain Should You Have: ccTLD Or gTLD?\nA decade ago, local domains (ccTLDs) were essential for international SEO success.\nToday, while they remain important, especially in markets like China or Russia, global top-level domains (gTLDs) can also be effectively optimized, reducing your management costs.\nUsing hreflang enables effective geotargeting, making the domain choice more flexible.\nHowever, consider user behavior. Local ccTLDs are still often preferred in certain regions, so understanding local consumer preferences is crucial.\nNote that some of the search engines, such as Baidu, still favor websites with local ccTLD.\nAlso, people outside the U.S. tend to click websites with local TLD over sites with .com or other generic TLDs especially of the ccTLD is used in offline advertising.\nNote that if you have a multilingual or multinational site, just having a ccTLD will not make the entire site target the country to which the ccTLD is assigned.\nDoes Hosting Location Matter?\nHistorically, hosting was an additional geotargeting signal to search engines, especially when using a dot-com domain.\nBut even though hosting location has become less critical for geotargeting, it still impacts site performance, particularly page load times in international markets.\nImplementing a Content Delivery Network (CDN) can help ensure fast access in and across geographies.\nIt is recommended that you periodically test your website simulating both mobile and location connection speeds to ensure you are providing a fast and positive experience for your visitors.\nBeyond hosting, proper geotargeting techniques, such as using hreflang tags for Google and language meta tags for Bing, are essential.\nIn addition, tools like Google Search Console allow you to assign each website a specific geographic target, which is a key factor in search engine optimization.\nHow Should I Go About Alternative Geotargeting?\nAs site owners moved away from ccTLDs to gTLDs and local hosts to CDNs, and Google sunset its GSC geotargeting feature, strong geotargeting signals were lost, making it critical to leverage other techniques, such as using hreflang tags for Google and language meta tags for Bing.\nIt is also essential to ensure, where possible, to add local market nuances with language, location, and currency into the pages.\nLeveraging schema markup with the business location details contributes to pages appearing more local.\nOptimizing For Non-Google Search Engines\nWhile Google is by far the most used search engine worldwide, locally grown search engines are very popular in some countries.\nThese search engines hold the majority of market share in key markets:\n- China (Mainland, Simplified Chinese language) \u2013 Baidu.\n- Russia and Eastern European Countries \u2013 Yandex.\n- South Korea \u2013 Naver.\nFailing to optimize for these search engines means missing out on significant opportunities in those markets.\nLocal search engines often require additional technical SEO work, such as governmental site verification, adherence to specific algorithms, or minimizing JavaScript to rank effectively.\nOf course, even in the countries where Google is most popular, ignoring other popular search engines, including Bing, limits your business potential.\nTranslation And Localization: More Than Just Words\nMerely translating content from your home market won\u2019t resonate with international audiences.\nBeyond accurate translation, effective localization for each country\u2019s local audience considers cultural nuances, local consumer behavior, and regional search trends to ensure optimal user experience of the site.\nKeyword research in each target country is vital. Even professionally translated content can fail to capture the actual terms that local users search for.\nKeep in mind that although the translators or the translation agencies provide a correctly translated document, they may not use the same words that people use to search for the information.\nCollaborating with native speakers or regionally knowledgeable agencies ensures your messaging resonates locally.\nCultural Sensitivity And Seasonal Variations\nWhen creating multinational websites, understanding and respecting cultural sensitivities is critical to building trust and engagement with your target audience.\nEach market has its own values, customs, and expectations, which must be reflected in the website\u2019s design, content, and messaging.\nFor instance, colors, symbols, and images that are acceptable in one market may carry negative connotations in another.\nBeyond language, elements like navigation structure, user interface preferences, mobile friendliness, and the tone of communication (formal vs. informal) should be tailored to align with local cultural expectations.\nSeasonal nuances also play a significant role in multinational website content and campaigns. Countries celebrate different holidays, and even those that share similar holidays may observe them in different ways or on different dates.\nEcommerce websites, for example, need to adjust promotions, product offerings, and delivery timelines to match local holiday seasons.\nAdditionally, awareness of regional weather patterns, festivals, and events can help align marketing campaigns with local buying behaviors and seasonal demands, enhancing relevance and effectiveness across different markets.\nDo I Need To Build Links For Each Website?\nIt\u2019s a hard \u201cYes.\u201d Even when you have one global site with all country or language sites under the same domain, you still want to build links to each site even when you already have lots of links pointing to your domain.\nLinks are critical for SEO, and each website you operate in a foreign market will need links from that market to build its own local authority.\nThis means building links from local and regional sites, rather than relying solely on global links to your main domain.\nFor example, you want to gain links from websites in India or targeting India to your Indian website. These local links help search engines recognize your website\u2019s suitability and relevance in the target market, and will boost its competitive positioning.\nWhat Else Should I Consider Before I Go Global?\nInternational SEO is an ongoing investment that requires not just budget but dedicated resources.\nEven multinational Fortune 100 companies frequently underestimate the need for local expertise in SEO, content creation, and technical maintenance.\nNo one has the luxury of having unlimited resources in each target country. This can become a major bottleneck, especially since SEO is not a \u201cone-off\u201d project but requires continued efforts and collaboration across multiple teams and stakeholders.\nSuccessful international SEO strategies allocate responsibilities between headquarters and local offices, ensuring that global goals are aligned with local execution.\nIf you lack in-country resources, you may need to partner with external agencies specializing in SEO and localization for international markets.\nHow Can AI Help Global Site SEO?\nWhile not a replacement for your SEO or localization teams, many companies are looking at AI to efficiently scale their SEO strategies, reducing manual effort while streamlining and enhancing the accuracy and relevance of their content for international markets.\nAI tools can complement your team and enhance localization and translation workflows by offering initial drafts of localized content to be refined by human editors who can adjust for nuance and tone.\nAI\u2019s ability to analyze large amounts of data quickly and provide actionable insights across markets helps businesses fine-tune their SEO efforts to improve rankings and visibility in local search engines.\nThis can be very helpful in markets with limited resources, freeing up team members to focus on actions that require human interaction.\nConclusion: Strategic Expansion Requires Focus\nA global website and international SEO are great ways to expand your market reach, but they also require extra resources and budget to ensure success.\nInternational SEO can open significant growth opportunities, but it requires a thoughtful, precise approach.\nResearch markets carefully, start small if necessary, and ensure you have the resources in place to scale effectively.\nBy focusing on local user experience, maintaining technical SEO best practices, and building local authority, your company can achieve a strong, sustainable global presence.\nMore resources:\n- International SEO For 2024: 9-Point Checklist For Success\n- Maintaining SEO Against Varying International Laws And Regulations\n- State Of SEO 2025\nFeatured Image: ImageFlow/Shutterstock"

      "text": "An SEO playbook acts as a guide for creating, executing, and sustaining effective SEO strategies.\nIt ensures that all participants, from marketers to developers, adhere to a unified and methodical approach.\nTypically the playbook encompasses essential elements that steer SEO initiatives, aligning them with business goals and promoting teamwork across different teams.\nCommunicating and working with the majority of the C-suite is rewarding and collaborative. Although overall \u201cSEO knowledge\u201d might not be as high (which is why we, as specialists, are brought into the fold), the core objectives provide common ground to align on:\n- Creating effective contribution of SEO (as a channel) against overall marketing key performance indicators (KPIs).\n- Effectively communicating with all business departments (C-suite, product, brand, sales, engineering) and getting \u201cSEO buy-in.\u201d\n- Reaching your Serviceable Available Market (SAM), Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM), and Total Addressable Market (TAM) with relevant brand touchpoints.\nThis is where developing SEO playbooks come into effect.\nIn my experience, your SEO playbook needs to be put together in collaboration with other MarComm teams and agencies and teams like product and engineering.\nWhen I was consulting with Gitlab, one of the biggest opportunities we found was from holding a call with the product team and asking them for their unfiltered opinions and input on how products were being represented on the website.\nCombining these insights from engaging non-marketing teams enabled more streamlined buy-in for SEO initiatives.\nBy integrating SEO into every aspect of an organization\u2019s marketing communication strategy, brands can ensure that all channels function together effectively to enhance visibility, engage audiences, and contribute towards the overall, meaningful KPIs.\nDeveloping SEO Playbooks\nThe first step in developing a successful SEO playbook in collaboration with sales, brand, and engineering teams is to understand the unique goals, priorities, and workflows of each team.\nWhile all teams are pulling in the same direction to the overall business goals, their individual team goals, KPIs, and how they contribute to the bigger picture will differ.\nBy understanding and respecting each team\u2019s unique priorities, you can create a foundation for a collaborative and impactful SEO playbook, as well as how to more effectively communicate how your SEO initiatives can positively impact their objectives.\nSales Team Priorities\nThe sales team\u2019s main focus is on converting leads into customers and driving revenue. Their priorities (and direct responsibilities) often include:\n- Using data to improve the likelihood that prospects will complete desired actions (e.g., signing up for a product demo, a trial, or making a purchase).\n- Understanding pain points, objections, and decision-making factors of potential customers. Then, providing feedback to other MarComms teams on how products/features are being represented at the various touchpoints.\n- Meeting or exceeding monthly, quarterly, and annual sales targets.\n- Ensuring that leads generated through SEO efforts are effectively managed and nurtured.\nBrand Team Priorities\nThe brand team\u2019s goal is to create a cohesive and compelling identity that resonates with target audiences.\nThere is substantial overlap here with the SEO team. More likely, we see elements of the brand team in any content tone of voice guides we receive. Their main responsibilities include:\n- Ensuring all communications reflect the company\u2019s tone, voice, and values.\n- Building strong relationships with customers through storytelling and emotionally resonant content.\n- Maintaining a consistent look and feel across all digital and offline touchpoints.\nEngineering Team Priorities\nThe engineering team plays a critical role in ensuring the technical infrastructure supports SEO initiatives and provides a seamless user experience.\nUnderstanding their processes from the get-go is imperative to not only implementing any technical SEO recommendations you provide, but also to proactively keep you in the fold and informed of any deployments that could affect SEO performance.\nDepending on the structure of the engineering team, their responsibilities will range from proactive development and bug fixing to managing infrastructure.\nDefine The Objectives Of The Playbook\nThe basic definition must outline a playbook for SEO purposes so that all teams have collective common goals.\nSuch goals create the guiding principle behind measuring SEO impact with the business and sales priorities of the brand.\nEstablish clear objectives to align SEO with business priorities:\n- Increase organic traffic, improve conversion rates, and boost brand awareness.\n- Track keyword rankings and clicks from keyword clusters (aligned with stages of the funnel/your audience segments).\n- Measure organic leads, SEO-driven conversions, and revenue attribution.\n- Branded search volume, content alignment, and engagement (measured through events in Google Analytics 4).\nThese objectives create a measurable framework for success.\nCreate Playbook Sections For Each Team\nCreate specific sections for each team in order for the playbook to ensure actionability and relevance to teams.\nSpecific strategies and guidelines should stem from the goals and responsibilities of each section.\nEncourage sales team members to submit content addressing typical objections or questions from prospects, ensuring SEO efforts bring in qualified leads and the content not only ranks for search terms but resonates with prospects at a level that keyword research tools and basic level intent classification don\u2019t tell us.\nBrand teams should contribute clear guidelines for brand consistent maintenance of meta-descriptions, headings, alt texts, and other SEO elements.\nThey need to share positive reviews, customer testimonials, and stories to help build trust and credibility and provide a better understanding to the SEO teams on what the target audience values pre- and post-conversion.\nEngineering teams need to contribute and (working with the SEO team) define a process for issue raising, prioritization, and deployment.\nThey should also share their overall processes and include the SEO team in scrum notes or agendas so any major potential issues can be understood and mitigated if necessary.\nFeedback Loops And Reporting\nRegular check-ins create a continuous cadence for teams to hear updates on progress and address issues.\nWeekly or bi-weekly meetings would provide an opportunity to review ongoing SEO initiatives, address impediments, and maintain alignment across departments.\nSessions of this nature would also provide an open platform for communication and keep the focus on the same objectives.\nCross-departmental reporting interlinks core SEO performance metrics like keyword rankings and organic traffic to tangible business outcomes like conversion and brand engagement.\nThis would illustrate the impact SEO efforts have on revenue or the brand\u2019s visibility to stakeholders concerning the strategic worth of SEO and its continued investment.\nAn SEO Playbook Is A Dynamic Resource\nYour SEO playbook should contain actionable insights to guide the next steps in underperforming pages, highlighting technical issues or suggesting areas for strengthening conversion paths so that teams could address such problems quickly and seize new opportunities for growth.\nData visualization takes these further. Instead of dashboards, charts, or interactive tools, show stakeholders the different possibilities the data presents.\nMonitoring and analysing metrics at a more granular level will allow you to better visualize user engagement, making it a lot easier to spot trends, measure progress, and prioritize strategic actions.\nIncorporating structured feedback loops and transparent reporting turns an SEO playbook into a dynamic, ever-evolving resource.\nIt adapts continuously, driven by new data, open communication, and collective insights, ensuring each SEO initiative delivers maximum value.\nMore Resources:\n- Working With Cross-Departmental Decision Makers for SEO Success\n- 5 Ways Brands Can Build an Enterprise SEO Culture\n- 5 Key Enterprise SEO Priorities CMOs Need To Get Right\nFeatured Image: Face Stock/Shutterstock"

      "text": "Most marketers now understand the value of social media as a marketing tool \u2013 and countless companies have now established their own presence across a variety of social platforms.\nBut while the importance of creating content and building an audience is well understood, many organizations are lacking when it comes to another key strength of social media: social listening.\nSocial listening is a strategic approach that can help your brand tap into the incredible breadth and depth of social media to hone in on what your target audience is saying and feeling \u2013 and why.\nBy investing in social listening, you can gain a deeper understanding of conversations happening around not just your brand but your broader industry, and extract meaningful insights to inform multiple areas of your business.\nIn this article, we\u2019ll explore what social listening is, why it\u2019s crucial for businesses today, and the tools that exist to help you do it before diving into tips for getting started with your social listening strategy.\nLet\u2019s get started.\nWhat Is Social Listening?\nSocial listening is the practice of tracking conversations on social media that are related to your brand, analyzing them, and extracting insights to help inform your future marketing efforts.\nThese conversations can include anything from direct mentions of your brand or product to discussions around your industry, competitors, relevant keywords, or other topics that might be tangential to your business.\nThe idea of social listening is that you\u2019re really getting to know your audience by sitting back and listening in to what they talk about \u2013 what their gripes are, what they\u2019re interested in, what\u2019s getting them excited right now, and much more.\nGathering this data and then examining it can help you in a number of ways, from uncovering useful product development insights to inspiring new content ideas or better ways to serve your customers.\nHere are some of the things you can achieve through social listening:\n- Tracking mentions of your brand, products, or services across social platforms.\n- Evaluating public perception and sentiment towards your brand by assessing whether mentions are positive, negative, or neutral.\n- Spotting trends that are emerging among your target market by noting common themes, topics, or keywords in conversations.\n- Gaining a better understanding of your audience, including who they are, where they spend time online, what they want, and how your brand can connect with them.\nAs such, social listening isn\u2019t just a powerful tool for marketing, but can also be leveraged to improve customer engagement and service, product development, and other areas of your business.\nWhat\u2019s The Difference Between Social Listening And Social Monitoring?\nIf you\u2019re finding yourself a little confused about the difference between social listening and social monitoring, you\u2019re not alone! The terms are often used interchangeably \u2013 when, in reality, they have different scopes and objectives.\nGenerally speaking, social monitoring is narrower and more focused on your brand specifically, while social listening takes more of a big-picture approach to gaining insights.\nIf social monitoring is about seeking out brand mentions and conversations to hear what people are saying, social listening is diving even deeper to understand why they\u2019re saying those things.\nSocial monitoring typically involves tracking social activity directly related to your brand so that you can stay abreast of what\u2019s happening at the moment and tackle any pressing issues.\nIn this regard, it\u2019s often leveraged as a component of a company\u2019s customer support program to help respond to queries, answer questions, and remedy complaints in a timely manner.\nIt can also help to identify trending topics or industry moments that might apply to your brand. Basically, social monitoring is all about being aware of what\u2019s happening around your brand on social media so you can respond quickly.\nSocial listening does all of this, but also takes things a few steps further, expanding the scope of what you\u2019re tracking and focusing on obtaining insights to help with brand strategy, content planning, and decision-making.\nWhere social monitoring might focus on mentions of your brand, social listening goes beyond that to explore broader consumer behavior and emerging industry trends, and make qualitative analyses of the conversations that are happening in those areas.\nOne analogy I\u2019ve encountered that I find helpful for understanding the difference between the two: If social monitoring is akin to tending your own backyard, social listening is like taking a walk through your neighborhood and eavesdropping on conversations to better understand what your neighbors are interested in and concerned about.\nWhile we are focused on social listening in this particular article, both social monitoring and social listening are important parts of an effective marketing strategy.\nWhy Is Social Listening Important?\nAs we\u2019ve touched on, successful social listening can benefit many areas of your business \u2013 from your marketing to your product and your customer support. And all of this means it can have a big impact on your bottom line.\nLet\u2019s look closer at just some of the reasons why social listening is an important tool in your business\u2019s arsenal.\nReputation Management\nSocial listening can help you get a sense of how your audience \u2013 and the general public \u2013 feels about your brand, products, messaging, or services.\nBy understanding both the positive and negative sentiments around your brand and where they come from, you can work to fill the gaps and improve perceptions of your company.\nUnderstanding Your Audience\nOn that note, social listening is a great way to learn more about your audience \u2013 from your current customers to your prospects and beyond.\nIt offers a looking glass into what your target consumer is thinking about, their opinions, pain points, desires, etc. With this information, you have the power to customize your content, message, and products to serve their needs better.\nMarket Analysis\nSocial listening is a powerful tool for unearthing insights into your industry \u2013 trends, consumer behaviors, opportunities, etc. This is the kind of information that you can use to get ahead of your competitors and deliver the ultimate customer experience.\nCompetitive Insights\nSpeaking of competitors, social listening enables you to keep a watchful eye on your competitors and learn from their successes and failures.\nYou can use active listening to determine how your target market perceives your competitors and apply your findings to differentiate yourself from the pack.\nCrisis Management\nLet\u2019s face it: Crises happen, no matter what your business or industry. But social listening can help you identify crises before they hit a boiling point, and address them in a timely manner.\nContent Strategy\nWant to know what content types and formats resonate best with your audience? Try social listening! Once you have the necessary insights, you\u2019ll be able to create more engaging content.\nLead Generation\nSocial listening can drive lead generation in a number of ways.\nYou can use it as a tool to discover prospects who are interested in your industry, product niche, or topics related to your business.\nBeyond this, by improving your content strategy, reputation, products, customer experience, and more using your social listening insights, you will ultimately boost more leads to your business.\nSocial Listening Tools\nGiven that social listening requires pulling data from millions of posts across social media and analyzing it, we would recommend using a tool to help with your efforts.\nHere are a few popular social listening tools.\nHootsuite\nKnown for its social management features, Hootsuite also offers a comprehensive suite of capabilities to help with your social listening efforts.\nThe platform allows you to create custom streams to track hashtags, keywords, or mentions across a range of social platforms. You can use these to spot conversations in real-time and engage with them.\nUsing some of Hootsuite\u2019s tools and integrations, you can also do things like track brand sentiment, listen into Reddit conversations, access consumer research, and more.\nPricing:\n- 30-day free trial.\n- Paid plans start at $99/month for the Professional tier and 249/month for the Team tier (billed annually).\n- Hootsuite offers an Enterprise tier with custom pricing.\nSprout Social\nSprout Social is another leader in the social media management space that is super useful for social listening.\nWith Sprout Social\u2019s Smart Inbox, you can pull all your mentions, comments, and DMs from across your social platforms into one single feed \u2013 helping you keep on top of what\u2019s happening.\nOther key features include audience analysis, campaign analysis, crisis management, competitor comparison, influencer recognition, sentiment research, and much more.\nPricing:\n- 30-day free trial.\n- Paid plans start at $249/month for the Standard tier, $399/month for the Professional tier, and $499/month for the Advanced tier (billed annually).\n- Sprout Social offers an Enterprise tier with custom pricing.\nBrandwatch\nBrandwatch is a strong social listening and analytics platform that can help you track and analyze conversations online.

Define Your Goals & Objectives\nAs with any big project, your first step before starting should be to set clear goals for what you want to achieve.\nWhy are you doing this, and what is the desired result? Sit down with your team and talk through these points in order to align with your objectives.\nYou might have one key objective or several. Some potential options could be:\n- Improve your company\u2019s customer service and support.\n- Gain insights to help inform product development and enhance product offerings.\n- Track brand sentiment across current and potential customers.\n- Develop a deeper understanding of the competitive landscape in your industry, and how your competitors are performing with social audiences.\n- Stay on top of industry events and trends so you can spot content gaps and opportunities ahead of time.\nWhatever your goals are, make sure you have them set from the beginning so you have clarity as you move forward.\n2. Pick Your Tool Of Choice\nWhile social listening can technically be done manually, it will never be as comprehensive as what you can get from leveraging a tool or platform.\nSocial media listening tools, like the ones we highlighted above, are able to synthesize data from millions of sources at once \u2013 not to mention their abilities to analyze sentiment, identify trends, spot activity, and more.\nSo, while they typically come with a price tag, the good ones are worth their weight in gold.\nDo your research and choose a tool that aligns with your objectives and your team\u2019s budget.\nLook for something that monitors many different touchpoints, offers comprehensive analytics, is customizable, and integrates with your existing tech stack (if necessary).\n3. Identify Target Keywords And Topics\nThis step is crucial: Take the time to define the keywords, topics, and hashtags that you want to \u201clisten in\u201d to \u2013 as these will provide the basis for your listening efforts.\nBe sure to include keywords and themes that are relevant to your brand but also your industry, so that you get information that\u2019s most useful to you. You could also discuss any keywords or topics you might want to exclude and why.\nThese might evolve or change over time, and that\u2019s okay \u2013 this is about setting up a well-considered and focused foundation based on what matters most right now, and what will help you achieve your goals.\n4. Decide On Your Workflow\nWho will be responsible for monitoring your social listening data? Who should be responding to relevant mentions? Whose job is it to analyze the data and report on learnings and progress?\nThese are all things you should consider early on so that you can develop a clear workflow that outlines responsibilities.\nBy establishing the process early on, you\u2019ll make sure that your efforts are not in vain and that you\u2019re able to really put your data to use.\nOne recommendation: Make sure that somebody is regularly monitoring conversations and engaging where necessary. You should be keeping a keen eye on your listening activity \u2013 and automated alerts can be very helpful here.\n5. Adapt As Needed\nAs part of the workflow we just discussed, somebody (or several people) should be responsible for routinely analyzing the data you\u2019re collecting \u2013 as, unfortunately, it won\u2019t analyze itself.\nSet up a consistent process for diving into your data, extracting insights, and then acting on them.\nThere\u2019s no point in allocating resources to a social listening program if you\u2019re not using the learnings to benefit your business.\nSo, be sure to adapt your content strategy, marketing efforts, customer service, and so on based on what the insights are telling you.\n6. Don\u2019t Forget Measurement\nWe all know the importance of social media measurement \u2013 and this extends to your social listening efforts.\nAs time goes on, continue to measure the success of your efforts against the goals and objectives you set out for yourself.\nThis will help you evaluate the impact of your social listening, and whether there are areas you should pivot or refine based on the data you\u2019re seeing.\nYou can also track social engagement metrics over time to see if your learnings have provided a boost in your social performance as a whole.\nIn Conclusion\nWith millions of conversations happening all around us on social media, any brand that isn\u2019t engaging in social listening is missing a major opportunity.\nBy taking the time to proactively (and attentively) listen to your audience and target consumers, understand them better, and put their feedback to use, you can drive considerable success for your business.\nSo, take some of the advice we\u2019ve shared here and start building out your social listening strategy today!\nMore resources:\n- 11 Social Media Content Types And Examples\n- 17 Awesome Examples Of Social Media Marketing\n- How To Dominate Social Media Marketing: A Complete Strategy Guide\nFeatured Image: batjaket/Shutterstock\nFAQ\nWhat is the significance of social listening for modern businesses?\nSocial listening plays a pivotal role for modern businesses by offering critical insights into audience behavior, industry trends, and brand perception. By analyzing conversations on social media related to their brand or market, companies can adequately respond to customer feedback, adapt their marketing strategies, and anticipate consumer needs. It not only aids in shaping product development and content strategy but also enhances customer service, reputation management, and competitive analysis. This strategic approach empowers businesses to make informed decisions based on the direct sentiments and unfiltered conversations of their target audience.\nCan you differentiate between social monitoring and social listening?\nSocial monitoring and social listening are distinct yet complementary components of a comprehensive social media strategy. Social monitoring is more tactical, focusing on tracking and responding to direct brand mentions, queries, and specific conversations related to immediate issues. Its objective is to maintain awareness of what\u2019s currently being said about a brand and to participate in these conversations promptly. Social listening, on the other hand, employs a broader, more strategic approach. It goes beyond mere tracking, analyzing the underlying sentiments, causes, and implications of social discourse to extract actionable insights. This process not only involves engagement but also a deep analysis of consumer behavior patterns and industry trends for a long-term strategy formulation.\nWhich social listening tools are recommended for businesses to utilize?\nFor businesses looking to execute an effective social listening strategy, a variety of tools are available that can help streamline the process. These include:\n- Hootsuite: Offers custom streams to monitor social conversations and sentiment, alongside integrations for broader consumer research.\n- Sprout Social: Features a Smart Inbox to consolidate social interactions for monitoring. It also provides tools for audience and competitor analysis.\n- Brandwatch: Analyzes brand mentions from an extensive range of sources, offering AI-powered sentiment analysis and trend spotting.\n- Meltwater: Monitors various feeds, from mainstream social media to Reddit and podcasts, enabling comprehensive analysis.\n- Talkwalker: Provides monitoring and analytical capabilities over a broad spectrum of online platforms, backed by AI sentiment analysis.\nBusinesses should select a tool that aligns with their specific needs and objectives, focusing on features like comprehensive analytics, broad monitoring capabilities, and the ability to integrate with existing technological infrastructure."

      "text": "Many SEO agency owners have a vision of growing their business, building a model that drives recurring revenue without having to sacrifice their time, energy, or sanity.\nUnfortunately, many agency owners get stuck in a plateau. They hit a ceiling on how many clients they can manage, yet don\u2019t have the cash flow to hire a team. What\u2019s an ambitious agency owner to do?\nIn this guide, I\u2019m sharing my growth strategies as a 10+ year SEO agency owner \u2013 from how to expand to new markets to how to implement a sustainable, scalable agency model.\nA CEO\u2019s Secret To Scalable SEO\nHow did a hopelessly distracted C student grow a 100-person global SEO agency?\nWell, it wasn\u2019t through \u201cgrowth hacks\u201d, offshoring, or selling courses.\nIt was through a passion for the craft: 30,000+ hours obsessing over the algorithm, speaking to clients, testing strategies, and doing the work.\nThere is no shortcut.\nBut there is a mindset.\nIt\u2019s a mindset that\u2019s attentive to the needs of real business owners. One that\u2019s future-forward, recognizing the unique challenges business owners face today. And a mindset that\u2019s creative in crafting an SEO service that helps business owners overcome these challenges.\nThis starts with understanding the market, finding the gaps, and bringing something unique to the table.\nHere\u2019s how to do that.\n1. Trim The Fat\nVery often, we agency owners get stuck in a rut of managing a high volume of low-paying clients. This burns out our resources and makes it very difficult to scale.\nIf you can\u2019t take on more, higher-paying contracts, you have very little room to grow. That\u2019s when it\u2019s time to \u201ctrim the fat\u201d, so to speak.\nFirst, identify the clients that are causing the biggest headaches for the least amount of contract value.\n- How much time is being put into managing those clients?\n- Are the time, energy, and resources worth the measly revenue for your business?\nNext, identify your best clients \u2013 not just in terms of money, but the client-agency relationship.\n- What are the characteristics that make working with them enjoyable?\n- Are these types of accounts profitable?\n- If so, what is the margin?\nThe tough news is that you will likely need to let some of the difficult clients go. But this is just to make space for more enjoyable, lucrative projects. Doing so also opens up breathing room for you to get more creative with your service offerings.\n2. Remove The Operational Bottlenecks\nBesides time-consuming clients, there are likely other factors that are hindering your agency\u2019s growth. This could be the lack of team resources to take on new projects, a lack of skills to reach that next caliber of service, or a lack of time on your part to bring it all together.\nThis is the time to take a good, hard look at your agency structure, resources, and processes.\nHere are a few common issues that can lead to inefficiency (and, ultimately, stagnation) in your business:\n- Lack of scalable systems to facilitate a seamless client intake to service to retention model.\n- Poorly defined roles for your team members, leading to confusion and churn.\n- Reliance on manual processes, slowing down the speed of service and creating bottlenecks in fulfillment.\n- Insufficient team training, leading to poor service quality.\nIdentifying the bottlenecks is the first step in fixing them. Trust me, this isn\u2019t just about good housekeeping; if your agency works like a well-oiled machine, it\u2019s better positioned to expand to new markets and take on more clients.\n3. Assess The Financial Health Of Your Agency\nNow it\u2019s time to get your financial house in order. The last thing you want to do is start selling SEO to new markets without first establishing a profitable, sustainable revenue growth model.\nIf available, look at your agency\u2019s past 2+ years\u2019 Profit and Loss statements.\n- How much revenue is your agency generating year after year?\n- What are your expenses?\n- Are you charging enough to offset the costs of personnel, software, your salary, etc.?\nAnalyze your financial reports to look for inefficiencies.\n- Is there a history of overspending?\n- Underearning?\n- Inconsistent cash flow?\nThis activity isn\u2019t meant to deter you from expanding to new markets; rather, it\u2019s a practice of taking a look at your business financials and making data-informed decisions.\nI highly recommend having a health cash reserve to help you manage unexpected costs and/or potential setbacks as you expand to new markets. Change can come with some unpredictability, so the more you can give yourself a cushion, the better.\n4. Identify High-Growth Markets\nBy this point let\u2019s assume your agency is financially sound, you have the space to take on new clients (because you have trimmed the fat), and have put systems in place to facilitate growth. How do you identify the hot new markets for expansion?\nOne way is to \u201cstay in the know\u201d by monitoring industry trends and news. Outlets like our very own Search Engine Journal are great at covering emerging markets, technologies, SEO applications, and more.\nAnother source of market research is Google Trends, where you can spot a rise in search volumes and emerging keywords. For example, at the time of writing this article, there was a significant uptick in topics related to law and government.\nI also recommend reading industry reports and surveys to see what\u2019s new in the market. For instance, Forbes often covers \u2018emerging markets\u2019 by location, demographics, and industries.\nLook for opportunities that indicate increasing and sustained growth. For example, the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been on the upswing for quite some time, while others (like all the craze about Instagram Threads) fizzle out.\n5. Look For The Gaps\nLook for opportunities in which your competitors have yet to capitalise on a new market or growth trend. If you\u2019re able to beat them to the punch, you\u2019ll be better positioned to win the lion\u2019s share of the market.\nThere are a few ways to do this. For one, you can be the first to launch a service offering to a new/emerging market. However, another way to \u201cfill the gap\u201d is to offer a different take on an existing service/model.\nFor example, say there\u2019s been an increase in demand for SEO services by tree removal service providers as a result of local storms (this has really happened).\nIn the midst of other marketing agencies pushing generic SEO packages, perhaps you offer a \u201cstorm-response\u201d -focused digital strategy, including rapid content updates and pay-per-click ads emphasizing emergency services.\nThis really requires you to think outside the box (remember, Mindset) to figure out 1) what the market needs, 2) whether you can be first to fill the gap, and 3) what makes you different from other SEO providers.\n6. Restructure Your SEO Offering\nScaling up your SEO agency requires adaptability. Stagnation is a real agency killer. To maintain an upward trajectory, you need to make some changes to your SEO service offerings.\nFor example, AI has been a hot topic for quite some time. While many agencies claim to leverage AI to streamline the content creation process, your claim to fame could be that you don\u2019t use AI, and instead offer a customized content model to provide additional value to businesses.\nOr perhaps instead of offering soup-to-nuts SEO services, you realize Content is the most profitable, so you niche down to focus on content strategy and blogging.\nRestructuring your services doesn\u2019t necessarily need to mean changing what you offer, though. It could mean changing how you offer it.\nLike if you typically provide customized SEO strategies (that change month to month), perhaps you find it more economical to offer out-of-the-box SEO plans that include the main components most businesses need to see traffic growth.\nIn my own SEO agency, Hennessey Digital, I noticed where some of our services were \u201cgood to have\u201d but not \u201cneed to have\u201d, or even services clients never ended up subscribing to.\nWe focused on the services that provided the best results for clients. And we are constantly adapting to the times, incorporating new technologies and strategies.\n7. Build A Scalable Team\nThe truth is, it\u2019s very difficult to grow your SEO agency with a team of one. At some point, you will need to bring on support, not only to manage the growing client load but also to offset gaps in your own skillsets.\nA great entrepreneur can recognize their constraints and see the strengths in others. New team members contribute new ideas, new ways of doing things, and new processes to help economize your business.\nThey may also have insight into the new markets you are looking to expand to. For example, if your agency has historically worked with home services providers, and now you\u2019re looking to expand to law firms, hiring a Marketing Manager with experience in the legal industry could be a huge benefit.\nStart by identifying the top 3 challenges your business is currently facing \u2014 and how hiring a skilled team member could offset these challenges. If the cost of hiring is easily offset by the new revenue brought in, it\u2019s a done deal!\nMaybe you can\u2019t hire someone full-time right away. That\u2019s okay! Consider outsourcing to start and then scale up incrementally as your business grows.\nScale Your SEO Agency With Confidence\nScaling up an SEO agency comes with its challenges, from resource limitations to difficult clients to financial constraints.\nBut most of these can be mitigated by proper planning, trimming the fat in your business, and shifting your mindset from solopreneur to CEO.\nIt\u2019s what\u2019s allowed me to grow my SEO business from a solo practice to a global agency. And while that didn\u2019t happen overnight, it was made easier once I was able to identify the gaps in my own skill set and find great people to inject creativity into my business.\nEvery agency owner is capable of scaling up \u2014 just look for those gaps and bring a fresh take to the market!\nMore resources:\n- How Brands Can Have Successful Agency Relationships [Part 1]\n- 5 Ways To Leverage Business Coaching To Grow Your Marketing Agency\n- A Guide To Essential Tools For SEO Agencies\nFeatured Image: fizkes/Shutterstock"

      "text": "When implementing effective SEO strategies for clients, a frequent challenge is managing limited resources, especially in content creation and the technical capabilities needed to execute SEO recommendations.\nThis complexity increases when working with organizations operating across multiple territories and markets.\nEach region may have its own set of regulations, language requirements, and market-specific needs, adding another layer of difficulty in executing consistent and compliant SEO strategies across different territories.\nIn these cases, strategies and routine activities often need to be adjusted to meet the specific laws and regulations of each location.\nNon-compliance with these regulations might not directly impact your overall digital performance.\nThe organization could face significant consequences in the form of legal charges and potential fines.\nAdjusting to these differences is essential for maintaining compliance and ensuring the successful implementation of SEO strategies.\nCommon Legislation\nWhile understanding legislation may not fall entirely within the scope of SEO, being aware of the limitations it imposes on activities and data collection is crucial.\nLegal regulations can directly impact how data is gathered, used, and stored, influencing SEO strategies in significant ways.\nBeyond the DMCA, other legal frameworks can also affect SEO efforts, depending on the region in which a business operates.\nCompliance with data privacy laws \u2013 like GDPR in Europe or CCPA in California, for example \u2013 can shape how businesses handle user data, adjust targeting, and execute their SEO tactics across different jurisdictions.\nGlobal Privacy Legislation\nPrivacy regulations have a significant impact on SEO, as they influence how businesses can collect, store, and use personal data.\nWhen we talk about privacy legislation, the two that generally come to the top of mind are the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).\nOther privacy legislations that you may come into contact with when working with a global organization include:\n- Japan\u2019s Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI).\n- Thailand\u2019s Personal Data Protection Act.\n- China\u2019s Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL).\n- Hong Kong\u2019s Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (HK PDPO).\n- Singapore\u2019s Personal Data Protection Act (SG PDPA).\n- South Korea\u2019s Personal Information Protection Act (SK PIPA).\n- The Australian Privacy Act 1988.\n- Brazil\u2019s General Data Protection Law (LGPD).\n- India\u2019s Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB).\nUnderstanding these different privacy laws and how they affect data handling (and user tracking) is important, as data between regions may not be directly comparable because of these laws.\nEuropean Accessibility Act (EAA) 2025\nThe EAA 2025 aims to improve accessibility for persons with disabilities across the EU by setting common requirements for certain products and services.\nIt aims to standardize practices, so that businesses comply with unified accessibility standards by June 28, 2025, promoting equal access to digital products and services.\nThis means that web design will need to adapt to meet specific accessibility standards, ensuring that websites are usable by individuals with disabilities.\nThis could include incorporating features like keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, alternative text for images, accessible forms, and adequate color contrast, allowing for a more inclusive online experience.\nAs companies work to adapt (and become compliant) to this legislation, third-party software may be introduced to websites to facilitate a number of (if not all) of the requirements.\nThis means adding scripts and potentially altering how a page loads and renders for both users (and search engines).\nGeo-Blocking Regulation (EU) 2018/302\nThe Geo-Blocking Regulation (EU) 2018/302 is a European Union regulation aimed at preventing unjustified geographical discrimination of customers within the EU\u2019s single market.\nIt came into effect in December 2018.\nThe regulation specifically targets practices that aim to block or redirect users trying to purchase goods, or services, online from a website \u201cbased\u201d in a different EU member state.\nA key feature of this is geo-blocking. The regulation aims to prevent geo-based redirects, such as automatically redirecting users to a different section of the website (such as a localized subfolder) based on IP.\nDuring the Covid pandemic, there were calls for regulation to adapt to the shifts in user behavior with online shopping.\nAnecdotally, I\u2019ve not seen many instances of companies in the EU falling foul of this regulation for geo-blocking.\nIn 2021, Valve, the company behind Steam, along with a number of video game publishers, were fined \u20ac7.8 million for geo-blocking practices. Outside of this instance, very few have surfaced in my news feeds.\nDifferences Between US State Laws\nLaws governing consumer protection, digital goods, and subscription services differ widely across U.S. states, resulting in unique legal frameworks that businesses must consider when operating in multiple regions.\nThese variations create challenges for companies, particularly in advertising and data compliance, as they must tailor their practices to meet the specific requirements of each state\u2019s regulations.\nConsumer Protection & Advertising Laws\nMany states implement their own criteria for defining deceptive advertising, with some, like California and New York, establishing stricter guidelines than federal standards.\nCalifornia\u2019s Unfair Competition Law (UCL) and New York\u2019s General Business Law are prime examples of state laws that set specific requirements for advertising practices.\nThese regulations often demand a higher level of compliance, making it essential for businesses to adjust their marketing efforts accordingly.\nAn example from the tangible world is the claim of \u201cMade in the USA.\u201d\nIn California, the definition of what qualifies as \u201cMade in the USA\u201d is notably more stringent than federal guidelines, directly influencing how companies can promote their products.\nBusinesses must carefully navigate these rules to ensure their advertising aligns with state-specific standards.\nLaws Governing Digital Goods & Services\nThe sale and advertisement of goods and services online in the U.S. are often governed by varying state regulations. One area where this is evident is in the treatment of digital goods, such as ebooks and software.\nSome states, like Texas, classify digital goods as taxable, requiring businesses to apply sales tax to their transactions.\nOther states, such as Delaware, do not impose taxes on digital goods. These differences mean that businesses selling digital products must remain aware of each state\u2019s rules to ensure compliance across multiple jurisdictions.\nSubscription Renewals\nSome states, like California, have specific rules around automatic subscription renewals. Businesses must clearly disclose renewal terms, obtain affirmative consent, and make it easy for consumers to cancel. Other states have less stringent or no such regulations.\nThis could lead to retention and MRR data being lower for states like California than others, and is important to understand this when reviewing data, and then using this to further inform marketing strategy.\nThis is especially pertinent in the SaaS space.\nWhat You Should Be Asking Your SEO Vendor\nCompanies must ensure that any third-party marketing vendors they work with are also compliant with these privacy laws.\nThis includes reviewing contracts and agreements with vendors to ensure they follow proper data-handling practices, including the ability to delete, disclose, or limit the use of consumer data.\nWhy This Matters\nGlobal compliance is essential for businesses to effectively manage the complexities of the international digital landscape.\nEnsuring that SEO strategies align with the legal frameworks of each region is a key part of this process and building long-term, sustainable organic campaigns that drive value across multiple territories.\nLooking ahead, it\u2019s not out of the question that Google may introduce a user accessibility metric, similar to how Core Web Vitals serve as a proxy for user experience.\nThere is some historical basis for this, with prior emphasis on HTTPS for securing the web, along with mobile-first strategies and page speed optimizations.\nWhile these factors are \u201cranking factors,\u201d the greater emphasis on them was to enact change across the wider internet to benefit users.\nMore resources:\n- The Intersection Of SEO And Accessibility: Optimizing For All Users\n- Why Do I Need A Privacy Statement?\n- Core Web Vitals: A Complete Guide\nFeatured Image: Rawpixel.com/Shutterstock"

      "text": "Building a quality pipeline right now is a challenge, and Google isn\u2019t making it any easier.\nChanges in how traffic and leads are coming to your site have probably shifted, yet lead generation is still a top priority.\nIt\u2019s critical to start by understanding that the customer journey has never been more important. Also, be aware that the final stages are where the most failures happen, such as not having your CRM and sales team ready before a campaign launch.\nIn a recent webinar, Brent Csutoras and I talked about the shifts that need to happen at an organizational level, not just within your marketing department.\nKeep reading for a takeaway of the nine insights we took from the webinar, and watch a full on-demand version here.\n9 Tips For Successful Lead Generation\n1. The Customer Journey Has Never Been More Important\nUnderstanding customer journeys is crucial for successful lead generation.\nBrent and I highlighted the shift in how users navigate online, emphasizing the need for content that addresses pain points throughout the funnel. Quality content that solves problems and adds value at every stage is the key to engaging and converting users effectively.\n2. Generating Quality Leads Takes Quality Content, Which Takes Research, Testing, And Budget\nCreating content that converts begins with thorough audience and market research.\nRegular testing, optimization, and diverse formats like blogs, videos, and emails ensure you can reach potential customers via a media channel that appeals to them. It\u2019s not going to be free, so make sure you allocate a content budget when talking to leadership.\n3. The Channels Are Working Fine. It\u2019s Your Content And Execution That Are Not Working\nTried-and-true channels still work. It\u2019s just that too many marketers focus on only the bottom of the funnel because it\u2019s easy to track and attribute.\nWhile some leads will convert from a single content piece, you must prepare for those who require more nurturing before they convert. Considering most of the content you create should be top- and mid-funnel, spend time matching the channel with intent.\nThese are just a couple of examples of channels that work. Watch the on-demand for more ideas.\n- Email marketing remains a powerful tool for lead generation, especially when focusing on segmentation and personalization.\n- Leveraging internal experts and influencers can build trust and credibility with your audience.\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of the channels we used to drive leads for this webinar:\n4. \u201cSweat The Assets!\u201d Meaning Use One To Make Many\nMaximizing the value of each piece of content is essential for scaling your efforts. Repurpose and tailor content for different platforms and audiences to ensure it serves multiple purposes.\nIt\u2019s also important to budget for both content creation and promotion, recognizing that quality content requires investment.\n5. You Should Expect To Pay Quality Money For Quality Leads\nInvesting in quality resources for lead generation may mean higher costs, but it can lead to higher quality leads and lower overall Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC). Consider all costs, including advertising and human resources. Optimization and continuous assessment are crucial for optimizing budget spend.\nPlus, low-quality leads take your valuable sales resources who could have been working on legit leads. A good lead-scoring strategy can help reduce resource drain.\n6. The Key Is An Always-On, Full-Funnel Strategy\nA common mistake is relying on a single piece of bottom-funnel content for all stages of the buyer\u2019s journey. Brands must engage their audience consistently from awareness to consideration, conversion, and retention to build loyalty and keep the cycle running.\n7. Know What Efforts Are Working For Your Goals\nContinuous evaluation is key to understanding the effectiveness of your lead generation strategies. However, with these shifts in customer demand and creating more top-of-the-funnel content, engagement is one of the most important metrics you can track to tell you if your content is resonating.\nCatch the on-demand webinar to hear more about metrics we think are important to track.\n8. Outside Vendors Impact Your Lead Gen Success\nLeveraging external resources can enhance your lead generation efforts, especially if you\u2019re a lean team. Treat vendors as team extensions, sharing goals and KPIs. Listen to their audience insights. Most importantly, ask if they offer real-time lead delivery to keep leads fresh and your brand top of mind.\n9. The Most Important Piece: No Follow-Up = No Leads\nDon\u2019t overlook what happens when a lead enters your system. Ensure your customer relationship management (CRM)/customer data platform (CDP)/marketing tech is ready. Set up lead scoring, automation, and dashboards. Prepare your sales teams to smoothly handle new leads, reducing launch day stress for everyone.\nIt\u2019s All About Building A Customer-Centric Experience\nThe bottom line is that the way customers want to interact with brands has changed. These strategies outlined above aren\u2019t new. We learned about them in Marketing 101, but they\u2019ve been pushed aside for product-focused marketing over the years.\nCustomers are really looking for brands who get them, and provide a solution to their pain. Then, they\u2019ll repay you with loyalty.\nSo, ask yourself \u2013 \u201cHow is the quality of my leads?\u201d Then, assess how much-focused effort you are putting into their journey.\nDiscover How You Can Supercharge Your Lead Generation Efforts\nAs a publisher, we serve as an agency to our advertisers (those looking to reach marketers and SEO professionals). That means we\u2019re marketing to marketers \u2013 some of the smartest out there \u2013and that\u2019s you!\nAnd what we\u2019re doing to drive quality leads is working.\nWhether you\u2019re an expert or just getting started, Brent Csutoras and I put this webinar together for you. It\u2019s full of functional takeaways that even the savviest marketers tend to forget, or worse, that leadership doesn\u2019t see the value in.\nThis on-demand webinar has insights that we\u2019ve been taking note of for years, and so should you. You can use this for strategy and to sway others in your organization to change the way you think about \u2013 and drive \u2013 leads.\nTrust us, you don\u2019t want to miss this!\nFeatured Image: Olivier Le Moal/Shutterstock"

      "text": "Communicating with expertise and authority is a top priority and there\u2019s no better starting point than outlining your content with a topic taxonomy as a way for creating content that has the best chance of ranking.\nA taxonomy is a system for classifying, organizing, and naming things based on shared characteristics. It is used in science to categorize things but it\u2019s a word that is also used to categorize anything, including topics, making it an effective SEO concept to understand.\nGoogle Identifies Topics\nGoogle\u2019s John Mueller once remarked about headings that they\u2019re about communicating what the topic is about in that block of content.\n\u201cAnd when it comes to text on a page, a heading is a really strong signal telling us this part of the page is about this topic.\n\u2026whether you put that into an H1 tag or an H2 tag or H5 or whatever, that doesn\u2019t matter so much.\nBut rather kind of this general signal that you give us that says\u2026 this part of the page is about this topic.\nAnd this other part of the page is maybe about a different topic.\u201d\nGoogle\u2019s Martin Splitt talked about how Google separates the boilerplate of a webpage (footers, headers, sidebars, etc.) in order to identify the main content and then using an outline of the content to identify the topic of the webpage, which he referred to as the Centerpiece Annotation of a webpage.\n\u201cThat\u2019s just us analyzing the content and, I don\u2019t know what we have publicly said about this, but I think I brought it up in one of the podcasts episodes.\nSo I can probably say that we have a thing called the Centerpiece Annotation, for instance, and there\u2019s a few other annotations that we have where we look at the semantic content, as well as potentially the layout tree.\nBut fundamentally we can read that from the content structure in HTML already and figure out so \u201cOh! This looks like from all the natural language processing that we did on this entire text content here that we got, it looks like this is primarily about topic A\u2026\u201d\nIn the above quote, Martin says there are additional annotations that are related:\n- The semantic content\n- The layout tree\nWhat\u2019s important is that Martin Splitt made it clear that Google is looking to identify the topic of the webpage.\nSo, your job is to outline the topic of the webpage and the subtopics that are relevant to that topic.\nTopic Taxonomy\nEvery search query and every webpage can be categorized as belonging to a topic.\nIn the context of content, a taxonomy of topics refers to the organization of information into different topics and subtopics that are inherent in the content. Organizing content by topic taxonomy helps to create an outline of the topics that a webpage can or must contain in order to be relevant for a topic that is inherent in a search query.\nThe goal of a taxonomy of topics is to provide a \u201cstructured framework\u201d upon which to craft a meaningful document that is semantically relevant to a given topic.\nA framework refers to the basic structures that are used to build something. A structured framework can be said to be one that is organized with a hierarchical structure.\nSimple Example Of Hierarchical Structure Of Topics\nTopic > subtopic\nThis is a way of looking at content from a high level, seeing the forest, not the trees.\nHow To Build A Topic Taxonomy\nTechnology like deep learning, neural networks, and RankBrain have helped Google evolve away from keywords and toward understanding the topics that are in content.\nSearch queries are about topics can can be categorized by topic like this:\nBeauty > Makeup > How-to\nA webpage can be categorized in a similar way. Webpages are rarely ever about one topic because there are always subtopics.\nSo, when thinking about a topic, you can also think about what the parts of that topic are.\nIf it\u2019s a clothing product page, then the parts of that topic (subtopics) are:\n- size\n- material\n- fit\n- fabric\n- care\n- description\n- reviews\nThose subtopics are the kinds of things a consumer expects to see when visiting a webpage about clothing.\nIf the webpage is about how to build links then the subtopics of that page can be:\n- research\n- analysis\n- outreach\n- templates\n- subject lines\nExample Of Importance Of Topic And Subtopics\nI once did one of those live website audits that they do at SEO conferences and this person said their website can\u2019t rank for a search term like Financial Information.\nThey had the keyword phrase Financial Information in the title, in the headers, in the alt text, all over the place, right?\nI looked at the website and the topic is clearly about Financial Advice, not financial information.\nSo I asked the website publisher why they were trying to rank for Financial Information if the website was about Financial Advice?\nAnd the person says, \u201cBecause the keyword volume is higher for Financial Information.\u201d\nSo, the reason website couldn\u2019t rank for Financial Information, despite all the links and keywords, was because the actual topic of the content was about Financial Advice and not about Financial Information.\nThis is why it\u2019s super important to begin with understanding the webpage topic then outline what the subtopics are based on what the user is expecting to find. Doing so forces the content to remain within set borders and not stray into an entirely different topic.\nAs I think most of us know by now, Google is no longer matching search queries to keywords. Google is matching search queries to relevant answers and the answers are always about topics and subtopics.\nAccuracy Over Comprehensive\nLastly, avoid making the mistake of being comprehensive.\nProviding a direct answer is always best because conciseness offers the benefit of clarity and it saves time. When people want an answer they want it fast and easy to understand.\nThis is true for consumer product page or on a review site. Don\u2019t linger on what\u2019s not of direct importance, be precise.\nGoogle is all about precision and being fast. That\u2019s one of the reasons why they chose the word Hummingbird for their 2013 update because the core algorithm rewrite made it perform faster and precise. Most subsequent updates had the feature of being precise.\nThat\u2019s why it is important to also be precise, not because Google is precise but because that\u2019s what users want, which is why Google focuses on precision.\nThinking in terms of a taxonomy of topics will help you stay focused on being precise and complete without going overboard with too much content and becoming off topic.\nStay on topic with a taxonomy of topics.\nFeatured Image by Shutterstock/Dim Tik"

      "text": "Whether you are in-house, a freelancer, or at an agency, sooner or later, someone will want to see a dashboard report that shows how the SEO program is doing.\nAnd there\u2019s nothing worse than building a dashboard and sharing it with various stakeholders only to realize no one ever looks at the dang thing.\nMost of the popular SEO tools come with various standard and custom reports. They can be great in many cases, particularly since they require less effort upfront by the user.\nThat said, we have found that building your own SEO dashboards can give you more control \u2013 and often more flexibility.\nIn practice, we like a mix of pre-built reports from tools, combined with our own custom reporting that lets us scratch some of our own particular itches.\nAn SEO dashboard can be a central hub for all your data sources so that you can get a full understanding of SEO performance.\nBut its real use is in telling stories stakeholders can understand and care about while hopefully providing SEO practitioners with actionable insights.\nSetting Goals And Identifying KPIs\nDepending on the dashboarding tool you choose, enterprise dashboards can be customized in a number of ways \u2013 so it is important to hammer out what the business objectives of the company are, and how the SEO program supports those goals.\nThat way, you can ensure that the reports displayed directly connect to the needs of the key stakeholders.\nFor instance, while you\u2019re mentioning metrics, including site traffic, keyword positions, and clicks, sales executives may be interested in hearing about revenue or ROI instead.\nWhile giving detailed reports to stakeholders is essential, your collected data won\u2019t mean anything to them without context.\nBreak down the numbers for them (and emphasize KPIs that they\u2019re keen to hear about).\nThis leads us to define what those KPIs are in the first place.\nHow To Categorize KPIs\nAfter identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) and setting clear goals, determine how to organize and group them in the dashboard.\nThere are a ton of ways to do this, but if you need some ideas, at my company, we tend to use reports such as:\n- Traffic performance: A report that shows basic traffic performance information from Google Search Console, including aggregate metrics (clicks, impressions, avg. CTR, avg. position), clicks and impressions over time, position bucket chart, and top keywords and pages.\n- Page type performance: Traffic report broken out by page types.\n- Query category performance: Traffic report broken down by different major query topics.\n- Linkbuilding performance: Shows data on links earned by LSG for the client.\n- Content performance: Shows traffic performance for pages created/updated for SEO.\n- Striking distance report: Shows pages within \u201cstriking distance\u201d from ranking well for high potential queries. This can be a quick way to find your next opportunity.\n- Date range comparison report: Compares performance data on the page/keyword level for a selected time period to the previous period or year.\n- SERP market share report: This shows how the client is performing in the search engine results pages (SERPs) for a group of keywords compared to their competitors.\n- Google Business Profile insights: Aggregated and broken down by location. Ability to filter by address, state, city, or other custom segments.\n- Cannibalization report: A report that shows when multiple pages are ranking for the same keyword. This can help us identify pages on a site that may benefit from differentiation.\nCreating a template for dashboards can save time, especially for those creating multiple dashboards for different sites or business units.\nUtilize a general template that includes the most frequently used reporting pages, and then customize it by adding or removing pages as necessary.\nDepending on the industry and needs, you likely will need additional reporting or modifications to tailor the dashboard and get the most value from it.\nWhere To Gather Data For Your Dashboard\nBefore selecting a dashboarding tool, it\u2019s essential to determine which data sources (such as GSC, Google Analytics, etc.) and data visualization platforms will be most beneficial for providing valuable insights.\nMany options are available depending on how much you need to customize your reporting, the skillset of the team building and maintaining the dashboards, and other factors.\nSome examples of data sources might include:\n- Google Search Console.\n- Whatever analytics tool you use (Google, Adobe, etc.).\n- Google Business Profile insights.\n- Third-party rank tracking data (e.g., Ahrefs, Traject, Semrush, Stat, etc.)\n- Proprietary data (e.g., we connect our backlink data to our dashboards via Google Sheets).\n- Other custom datasets.\nWe warehouse most of this data, including Google Search Console, Traject, and Semrush data in Google BigQuery for data flexibility and speed.\nIn terms of data visualization and dashboarding, we use Looker Studio (formerly Google Data Studio). It\u2019s free \u2013 and while it has its share of trade-offs, it\u2019s pretty flexible for how we use it.\nExamples Of Reports For Different Use Cases\nThere are various modifications that may be necessary for different industries to accommodate different metrics and customize reporting.\nThese use cases can give you a better understanding of how to fine-tune what reports might be best to create and what data and KPIs you could include.\nOf course, there are an infinite number of reports you could create, but here are some of the basics we like:\n1. Monitor Local Pack Appearances And Performance Over Time\nThis feature is particularly beneficial for businesses with multiple locations. It allows you to quickly show and measure your map pack performance.\nFor example, a national retail brand would likely want to use this to track its local SEO.\nYou can also organize the data by location and provide the ability to filter by state, city, region, and zip code.\nThis can be very valuable because it can help a brand identify challenges and opportunities at the local level.\n2. Filter Traffic By Branded Vs. Unbranded Keywords\nThis is probably our favorite report type.\nThe ability to filter traffic by branded and unbranded keywords is a function you can implement with nearly all dashboards, as it\u2019s nearly universally useful.\nNon-branded traffic can be more valuable for increasing brand awareness and reaching new customers, while branded traffic is typically more valuable for driving sales or conversions, as these visitors are already familiar with your product or service.\nSegmenting data this way can be particularly illuminating for businesses that have strong brands.\nOften SEO performance can be obfuscated by brand search patterns.\nBy stripping away brand queries, we can start to get a picture of how the SEO program really performs. Because of this, we make non-brand-only reports the default filter on every report.\n3. Report On Custom Keyword Categories\nUnderstanding how your site performs at the \u201ctopic\u201d level vs. looking at specific keywords can be illuminating.\nThis requires either manually or programmatically tagging the keywords you are tracking.\nThis type of report can be particularly helpful in tracking how search engines are treating you on specific topics.\nFor example, last year, we had a client growing in rankings and traffic for keywords for its core service category (e.g., hardware store), but it was losing rankings and traffic for \u201creviews\u201d queries (e.g. tool reviews).\nThis stood out visually in our Category report and helped us quickly identify the pattern and come up with solutions to reverse it.\nWe also use these Category buckets in Share of Voice reporting to show how a site compares to its competitors at the topic level.\n4. Report On Market Share By Location\nThis reporting gives you the ability to demonstrate how effectively they are growing in an existing or new market. This can be locally focused, such as a city or state, or it can be nationally focused.\n5. Report On Google Analytics Goals\nBy taking data from Google Analytics, you can show and measure the performance of customized goals for better reporting.\nExamples of goals include a user making a purchase, a contact/lead form submission, appointments booked, or even how long the user spent on the site.\nWe find the main challenge with these types of reports is that most sites do not have goals set up correctly in Analytics.\nBut that\u2019s for another post.\n6. Segment Data By Country\nThis reporting was built to segment data by country. This can be useful for brands seeking to expand their reach and gain more visibility.\nBy overlaying and filtering these markets, you can get a clear idea of how they stack up against each other and how the initiatives are performing as a whole.\n7. Striking Distance Reporting\nStriking distance reports can quickly give you an idea of which pages to focus on based on how close they are to ranking well for high-potential queries/topics.\nYou can see where this reporting gets powerful in the red box above.\nA user can filter and create their own criteria for \u201cstriking distance\u201d (e.g., impressions > X, CTR > Y, etc.).\nAdditional good filters for this report include conversions, revenue, average order value, etc.\nOur agency uses GSC for all the data but supplements it with monthly search volume estimates from Semrush.\nTypically, we only update these periodically as they don\u2019t change often, and it keeps API costs down.\n8. Reporting And Monitoring Domain Migrations\nThere\u2019s nothing more nail-biting than redirecting your old site to a new domain and then waiting to see what happens to the SEO.\nWe developed this report so you can quickly see where the old domain was and how the new domain\u2019s metrics compare. It also can be helpful to filter this report by page type, category type, region, etc.\nIn the first two to four weeks post-migration, this is probably our most viewed report, particularly in the middle of the night.\n9. Benchmark Reporting Of Before Vs. After Making Changes To Your Site\nIt\u2019s fairly obvious, but being able to mark when site releases were pushed live on your reports can be extremely helpful in determining whether or not a release helped or hurt your SEO.\nIt wasn\u2019t ready at the time of this publication, but the next version of this report will also have the option to see whether or not a change in performance post-release was statistically significant.\nIf the change is not statistically significant, then it\u2019s likely the site is experiencing a normal traffic fluctuation.\nDetermining this quickly can be quite helpful when a stakeholder is concerned about a Google algorithm update or whatever is making their imaginations run wild when they see a traffic dip.\nMake The Dashboard Reporting Digestible\nWhatever you decide to include in the dashboard, you should balance using detailed reports to show how your SEO initiatives are progressing with using your reporting to tell a story for key stakeholders.\nThe reality is most stakeholders will not check your reports regularly, so make sure the front page has the most digestible, valuable information.\nAdditionally, make sure deep reports are useful for the actual user \u2013 who is usually not the CMO.\nInstead of making them go to the dashboard, consider bringing the reports to them.\nFor example, you could deliver automated bite-sized summary reports, statistically significant changes in traffic, or GBP updates via email or slack.\nWhen in doubt, keep the reporting simple but comprehensive.\nShould You Build Or Buy An Enterprise SEO Dashboard?\nIf you have the skills and expertise to build enterprise dashboards, they can be well worth it, as they have great functionality in communicating and tracking performance.\nCommunication with stakeholders is a key challenge \u2013 particularly less technical stakeholders who nevertheless often control the budget. Being able to quickly and effectively display what they care about has tremendous value in both the short and long term.\nIf you do not need complex custom reports, there are plenty of out-of-the-box solutions that can help vs. investing in building it yourself.\nFor out-of-the-box solutions, you might consider options such as Klipfolio or Databox. They are simple and easy to use, but the drawback is they lack the ability to customize reporting.\nIn either case, it would be wise to have a system for gathering feedback from users and iterating on the dashboard to ensure it\u2019s designed or arranged in a way that is most useful to everyone.\nThe Bottom Line\nEnterprise SEO dashboards offer a number of benefits, as they help agencies and internal stakeholders track, manage, and report on key performance indicators.\nA centralized dashboard can organize priorities, gather data, and provide powerful data insights.\nThis allows agencies and stakeholders to effectively communicate progress on business objectives and the overall value of each facet of the SEO program.\nMore resources:\n- Top 17 Enterprise SEO Metrics To Inform Your Reporting\n- 7 Common Enterprise SEO Reporting Mistakes To Avoid\n- Enterprise SEO Guide: Strategies, Tools, & More\nFeatured Image: ZinetroN/Shutterstock"

      "text": "Setting up and running a website or ecommerce project is great \u2013 however, your work is far from done once your site is up and running.\nWithout appropriate health and performance monitoring, your website will suffer the consequences \u2013 which can be far greater than simply slow load speed.\nLet\u2019s turn our attention to a hypothetical, ideal scenario where all the websites in the world are functioning as they should. Did you know that, aside from skyrocketing user satisfaction, we would also contribute to a better environment?\nPoorly performing websites not only impact anyone who creates or uses them, but they also leave a larger carbon footprint.\nAccording to the Website Carbon Calculator, websites have a carbon footprint, and the average website page emits 0.5 grams of carbon dioxide per view. That\u2019s just the median.\nWhen looking at the mean, which also considers high-polluting websites, that number goes up to 0.9 grams.\nAside from issues on a global scale, an unhealthy, inadequately-performing website will cost you time, money, and revenue. Website health is similar to our own: it\u2019s easy to neglect and difficult to improve.\nYou need to be aware of the main components that make up website health to conduct appropriate monitoring practices to help save processing time.\nWith the emergence of quick and easy website builders, crafting websites has become accessible to everyone. All you need to do is sign up, choose a domain, pick your template, and voila! You have a website in seconds.\nHowever, many website owners dismiss the fact that website creation is only the first step. Appropriate performance maintenance and health monitoring are also crucial.\nAnd on that note, let\u2019s look at some essential website health and performance indicators: what they are, how to monitor them, and how to make improvements.\nAspects To Monitor For A High Website Health Score\nCore Web Vitals\nGoogle PageSpeed Insights\nThe first metrics you should consider when conducting performance testing are your Core Web Vitals. These performance indicators show speed, stability, and responsiveness, helping you understand the quality of your website user experience.\nSeveral tools track your Core Web Vitals, but many website owners gravitate towards a simple tool: Google PageSpeed Insights.\nAfter entering your URL into the tool, you will be presented with a report showing whether you passed your Core Web Vitals test and any other aspects you need to keep an eye on. Here are the three key metrics you will see:\nLargest Contentful Paint (LCP)\nAim for a score of 2.5 seconds or less.\nIf your score is over 2.5 seconds, this could indicate the following: your server is lagging, resource load times are not up to par, you have high numbers of render-blocking JavaScript and CSS, or there is slow rendering on the client side.\nAim for a score of 100 milliseconds or less.\nIf your score exceeds that time, you may need to reduce third-party code impact, reduce JavaScript execution time, minimize the main thread work, keep transfer sizes small, and request counts low.\nAim for a score of 0.1 or less.\nIf your score exceeds this, you can avoid random layout shifts by including size attributes on your visual and video content (or reserve the space with CSS aspect ratio boxes). Avoid overlapping your content, and be mindful when animating your transitions.\nPage Speed Blockers\nSeveral factors can affect your website load speed. However, if you\u2019re on a time budget and would like to focus on the main culprits first, pay close attention to the following factors:\n- Unused JavaScript and CSS Code.\n- Render blocking JavaScript and CSS Code.\n- Unminified JavaScript and CSS Code.\n- Large image file sizes (more on that below).\n- Too many redirect chains.\nIn order to improve the load of JavaScript and CSS files, consider preloading them.\nAnother option would be enabling early hints, which tells the browser in the HTTP server response which resources it should start downloading by taking advantage of \u201cserver think-time,\u201d thus speeding up the page load.\nTo test your website:\n- Navigate to https://pagespeed.web.dev/\n- Enter the URL of the page you want to scan.\nI would recommend choosing your homepage first.\nAnother handy tool is WebPageTest.org, which also shows your Core Web Vitals and other metrics that can help you drastically improve your website performance and health. Also, it\u2019s free!\nSimply paste a page URL into the search box shown on the site, and it will conduct a full test from a default location.\nYou can also register as a user and choose from a list of locations to test your website from different countries, devices and browsers.\nWebPageTest will show you exactly where your website is in terms of performance, and what could be slowing it down through a Performance Summary composed of four key sections: Opportunities and Experiments, Observed Metrics, Real User Measurements, and Individual Runs.\nAt UCRAFT, we use a combination of tools such as PageSpeed Insights, Chrome Dev Tools, WebPageTest, and several others, to gain a clear understanding of what we need to work on when it comes to our website performance \u2013 especially since the SaaS industry is highly competitive already.\nDesign Elements\nWhen we think about website performance and health monitoring, we usually leave these to the tech team to deal with.\nBut what if I told you how you design your website, and the elements you choose can make or break your performance?\nThat\u2019s right \u2013 it\u2019s time to get the design team involved.\nImage Optimization\nImages are great, but they can slow down your website if they are not sized appropriately. Make sure to resize your images, and avoid uploading giant files when they will not be shown in their entirety.\nLikewise, compress your images and try out different file types like WebP, JPEG 2000, and JPEG XR instead of opting for heavier JPEG or PNG files.\nConsider implementing native lazy loading to ensure that images are loaded when the user views them, instead of loading them all at once.\nAlmost all browsers, including Chrome, Safari, and Firefox, support loading=\u201dlazy\u201d attribute on <img> or <iframe>, which tells the browser to load them when the user scrolls closer to them.\nMake sure not to lazy load above-the-fold images, as it will degrade the LCP score of your page, and Google recommends using fetchpriority=\u201dhigh\u201d attribute on images above the fold to improve LCP.\nIf you use that attribute, no need to preload the images. You should either preload or set \u201cfetchpriority\u201d attribute on images above the fold.\nAlso, take advantage responsiveness of the \u201csrcset\u201d attribute to load properly sized images based on the screen size, and avoid loading redundantly large images on small screens. This will greatly help to improve LCP score.\nFonts\nExtravagant custom fonts are often challenging to read for users without 20/20 vision, but they can also considerably slow down your website.\nSwitch externally-hosted fonts for more web-safe fonts, and give Google fonts a try \u2013 as long as they are hosted through Google\u2019s CDN.\nMoreover, consider incorporating variable fonts into the general aesthetic of your website, since this font specification can significantly reduce font file sizes.\nMake sure to preload your fonts.\nAnimations/Additional Features\nThis goes without saying: Don\u2019t go overboard with animations, videos, special effects, sliders, or other fancy elements.\nIt\u2019s nice to include some interactive elements here and there, but saturating your website with too many moving \u201cthings\u201d can be frustrating for users and your servers alike.\nDon\u2019t use non-composited animations, as they cause re-painting of the page, which increases main-thread work \u2013 and the webpage may appear visually unstable when it loads.\nPWA Solution For Mobile Optimization\nWhy not go the entire mobile-friendly route and turn your mobile site into a Progressive Web App (PWA)?\nSince PWAs are built with service workers, they load cached content at a quicker rate. Not only that, but PWAs resemble native mobile apps, which is great for performance and UX.\nAdditional Technical Performance Metrics\nUptime\nUptime shows how well your website is functioning.\nIf your website crashes or is down frequently, it will harm your user experience, Google rankings, and, therefore, your revenue.\nIf possible, aim to have a 99.999% uptime and test your website from different locations.\nTools for uptime monitoring:\nDatabase Performance\nIf you\u2019ve checked the basics and your website is still slow to respond, it might be due to poor database performance.\nYou can check this by monitoring the response time for your queries and pinpointing the database queries that are taking up the most time.\nOnce you\u2019ve done that, get optimizing! You can use tools such as Blackfire.io to help you easily identify bottlenecks and find solutions based on accurate data.\nWeb Server\u2019s Hardware\nYour website may lag if your disk space is packed with log files, images, videos, and database entries. Make sure to monitor your central processing unit (CPU) load regularly, especially after you\u2019ve implemented updates or design changes.\nTools such as New Relic can help you improve your entire stack through efficient monitoring and debugging.\nSearch Visibility\nA lot of the metrics discussed above already have a significant impact on search visibility.\nSo when you run your website pages through Google PageSpeed Insights and optimize them, you are also doing important things for your SEO.\nYou can also opt for website crawling tools such as Semrush or Sitechecker.pro, Screaming Frog, DeepCrawl, or any other tool that best suits your needs.\nWebsite crawlers help find all types of issues, such as:\n- Broken links.\n- Broken images.\n- Monitor core web vital metrics.\n- Redirect chains.\n- Structured data errors.\n- Noindexed pages.\n- Missing headings and meta descriptions.\n- Mixed content.\nMake sure you\u2019re all set when it comes to the following points:\n- XML sitemap \u2013 Ensure your sitemap is formatted correctly and check whether it\u2019s necessary to make any updates and re-submit your sitemap via Google Search Console.\n- Robots.txt \u2013 Ensure you utilize a robots.txt file for your web pages (HTML, PDF, or any other non-media formats that search engines can read) to manage crawl traffic better, especially if you suspect your server may be overwhelmed by requests from Google\u2019s crawler.\nWebsite Security And Caching\nGet Your SSL Certificate!\nA healthy website is a secure website.\nEven if your website loads in perfect time and gets a 100/100 score, there is no way users (or search engines) are going to trust your site if it doesn\u2019t start with https://.\nAn SSL certificate is essentially a code on your server that builds an encrypted connection, guaranteeing that user data remains secure.\nObtaining an SSL certificate is not a particularly difficult process, but it can be lengthy when done manually.\nHowever, if you are using a well-established hosting provider such as BlueHost, more often than not, your provider will be able to issue a free SSL for your domain.\nConsider Using A CDN\nContent delivery networks (CDNs) are distributed servers working in unison to deliver fast internet content.\nIn other words, a CDN is a tool that speeds up the performance of your website by keeping its content on servers close to users, regardless of geographic location. This is also known as caching.\nIf you have a global presence, a CDN is a must! It will increase your page load speed, decrease your bandwidth costs, spread out your traffic (reducing the chances of your site going down), and increase security via features like DDoS mitigation.\nTop players in the industry include Cloudflare, Amazon Cloudfront, and Google Cloud CDN. However, there are many other options, so do your research and pick the best CDN for your website and business requirements.\nSetup Web Application Firewall\nA Web Application Firewall (WAF) protects web applications by filtering out suspicious HTTP traffic. It is aimed at preventing applications from attacks such as:\n- Cross-site forgery.\n- Cross-site-scripting (XSS).\n- File inclusion.\n- SQL injection.\nBelow is a list of the most popular and trusted web application firewalls:\nOr if you use WordPress, you can consider installing plugins such as:\nVerdict\nThat\u2019s a wrap! As you can tell, website performance and health depend on various aspects.\nIf your website is lagging, the first logical step is to check your Core Web Vitals and see what you can improve. You can also take a look at other technical metrics and improve on them.\nSEO is also vital to your website\u2019s health, so check your search visibility, links, and potential load blockers to see what you can improve on.\nAnd don\u2019t forget about your SSL certificate and caching, either.\nYour website design can also impact your load speed and performance, especially if you or your designers are fond of using weighty design elements.\nRemember to optimize your images, avoid heavy fonts, and use animations in moderation.\nMore resources:\n- How To Use Chrome UX Report To Improve Your Site Performance\n- 6 Tips For Supercharging Google Display Network Performance\n- Advanced Technical SEO: A Complete Guide\nFeatured Image: JulsIst/Shutterstock"
