  "description": "OpenAI held discussions with the UK government about offering ChatGPT Plus access to all residents, a deal that would cost a few billion pounds.",
  "content": "The AI race is unforgivingly fast and brutal. Industries have already adopted it, and the biggest AI companies are racing to put it in the hands of students through exclusive deals and discounts. Now, it seems the next avenue is giving universal access to all citizens, starting with ChatGPT Plus.\n\nPeter Kyle, Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology in the UK, has reportedly held discussions with OpenAI that involve giving ChatGPT Plus access to all UK residents. This would be one of the first deals of its kind for OpenAI, after unverified reports claimed that the UAE was also giving free ChatGPT Plus access to all citizens earlier this year.\n\nChatGPT Plus is a $20/month paid tier that offers a handful of perks, such as priority access to users, higher limits for using the latest AI models, expanded voice chat, image generation, file analysis, Deep research, and the ability to create custom bots called GPTs. The free version is available to all internet users, even without creating an account.\n\n\u201cThose close to the discussion say Kyle never really took the idea seriously, not least because it could have cost as much as \u00a32bn,\u201d reports The Guardian, citing two unnamed sources privy to the meeting that happened in San Francisco. The UK minister has reportedly held multiple meetings with OpenAI chief Sam Altman this year.\n\nThe minister recently praised ChatGPT as a \u201cfantastically good\u201d tool, while OpenAI has expressed interest in democratizing access to AI tools for its user base in the country. The UK government has already inked deals with OpenAI that involve access to the underlying API for developing custom bots to help businesses and civil servants.\n\nIn January, the UK revealed plans for a secure digital wallet system that covers driver\u2019s licenses and other approved identity documents in collaboration with OpenAI. A core part of this partnership was building a chatbot that would be rolled out across the GOV.UK web portal and mobile app.\n\nGiving access to advanced tools is a proven way of winning converts. And since the UK is already one of the biggest markets for ChatGPT, it would make sense to offer ChatGPT Plus access to all citizens, even for a limited time. This won\u2019t be the first initiative of its kind for OpenAI, or the UK.\n\nEarlier this year, OpenAI launched a similar program that offers free ChatGPT access to students in the US and Canada for a period of two months. In August, the company launched ChatGPT Go, a new subscription tier for users in India that costs roughly $4.57 per month and offers some of the core ChatGPT Plus benefits.\n\nBut OpenAI won\u2019t be the only major AI player to try such tactics, and neither is it the most aggressive at it. Google already offers Gemini Pro ($20/month) for free to students in the US, Japan, Indonesia, Korea, India, and Brazil. Additionally, it bundles the Gemini subscription with the purchase of its smartphones, such as the Pixel 10 series.\n\nFurthermore, access to Google\u2019s premium AI tools is also available as a perk to users paying for the Google One AI plan, which also gives access to 2TB of cloud storage. It appears that courting the interest of governments and offering AI at subsidized rates is the next frontier for expansion.\n\nIn India, a parliamentarian urged the government to dole out free access to advanced AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. The UAE government recently open-sourced its Falcon AI to use and modify freely, and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI has also announced that its Grok 2.5 model has is now in out in the open source domain.",

      "text": "Artificial Intelligence, otherwise known as AI, has been dominating the news for the past few years, and of all of the potential chatbots you can use ChatGPT stands out as a ground breaking development which has captured global attention from businesses down to personal use.\nFrom its impressive capabilities and recent advancements to the heated debates surrounding its ethical implications, ChatGPT continues to make headlines. It\u2019s latest advancement \u2013 ChatGPT-5 \u2013 is on the horizon with an expected release at some point in August.\nWhether you\u2019re a tech enthusiast or just curious about the future of one of the best AI chatbots, dive into this comprehensive guide to uncover everything you need to know from the creator of the ChatGPT down to how to use the artificial intelligence.\nWhat is ChatGPT?\nChatGPT (which stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is an AI chatbot, meaning you can ask it a question and it will generate a reply. However, this type of artificial intelligence is set apart from assistants like Siri or Google Assistant because it uses LLM (large language model) which is trained on massive amounts of data to generate human-like responses. They\u2019re not built for a specific purpose like chatbots of the past which just spit out predetermined answers \u2014 they\u2019re a whole lot smarter.\nThe current version of ChatGPT is based on the GPT-4 model, but we\u2019re expecting the GPT-5 model to release imminently. The current model was trained on all sorts of content including websites, books, social media, news articles, and more \u2014 all fine-tuned in the language model by both supervised learning and RLHF (Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback).\nWho created ChatGPT?\nChatGPT was created by OpenAI, a San Francisco-based AI research lab. OpenAI was originally founded as a non-profit organization in 2015 with the intention of developing safe and beneficial artificial intelligence. There were multiple rounds of large investments from names like Elon Musk.\nOpenAI later transitioned to a for-profit structure in 2019 and is now led by CEO, Sam Altman. It runs on Microsoft\u2019s Azure system infrastructure and is powered by Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, including the new supercomputers just announced this year.\nMicrosoft has invested heavily in OpenAI since 2019 as well, expanding its partnership with the AI startup in 2021 and again in 2023, when Microsoft announced a multi-billion dollar round of investments that included naming its Azure cloud as OpenAI\u2019s exclusive cloud provider.\nWhen was ChatGPT released?\nChatGPT was originally released to the public in November 2022, running off of the GPT-3.5 model. Ever since, it\u2019s had multiple advancements implements in order to improve the system leading to the current version which uses the GPT-4 model.\nGPT-3 was first launched in 2020 but was licensed exclusively to Microsoft, GPT-2 released the year prior to that, though it was never used in the public-facing ChatGPT system.\nHow to use ChatGPT\nTo use ChatGPT, open up a web browser and go to ChatGPT.com. If you\u2019d like to maintain a history of your previous chats, sign up for a free account. You can use the system anonymously without a login if you prefer.\nUsers can opt to connect their ChatGPT login with that of their Google-, Microsoft- or Apple-backed accounts as well. At the sign up screen, you\u2019ll see some basic rules about ChatGPT, including potential errors in data, how OpenAI collects data, and how users can submit feedback. If you want to get started, we have a roundup of the best ChatGPT tips.\nUsing the system itself is very simple, just type your prompt into the text box and the chatbot will respond. You can ask ChatGPT just about anything from very simple conversations and yes/no questions down to asking the chatbot to research entire projects for you.\nIf you don\u2019t get the result you want, you can adjust or build on your original prompt which the AI will remember \u2013 it may just be the case that ChatGPT needs more instructions.\nFor example, starting with \u201cExplain how the solar system was made\u201d will give a more detailed result with more paragraphs than \u201cHow was the solar system made,\u201d even though both inquiries will give fairly detailed results.\nTake it a step further by giving ChatGPT more guidance about style or tone, saying \u201cExplain how the solar system was made as a middle school teacher.\u201d\nYou also have the option for more specific input requests, for example, an essay with a set number of paragraphs or a link to a specific Wikipedia page. We got an extremely detailed result with the request \u201cwrite a four-paragraph essay explaining Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein.\u201d\nChatGPT is able to complete the majority of tasks thrown its way with the exception of physical tasks \u2013 not for lack of knowledge, if you ask the chatbot how to fold clothes, it will be able to tell you, the only thing stopping it is the lack of interface also known as its own working arms and legs.\nYou can\u2019t ask absolutely anything, though. OpenAI has safeguards in place in order to \u201cbuild a safe and beneficial artificial general intelligence.\u201d That means any questions that are hateful, sexist, racist, or discriminatory in any way are generally off-limits.\nSince its launch, people have been experimenting to discover everything the chatbot can and can\u2019t do \u2014 and the results have been impressive, to say the least. Learning the kinds of prompts and follow-up prompts that ChatGPT responds well to requires some experimentation though.\nMuch like we\u2019ve learned to get the information we want from traditional search engines, it can take some time to get the best results from ChatGPT. It really all depends on what you want out of it. To start out, try using it to write a template blog post, for example, or even blocks of code if you\u2019re a programmer.\nOur writers experimented with ChatGPT too, attempting to see if it could handle holiday shopping or even properly interpret astrological makeup. In both cases, we found limitations to what it could do while still being thoroughly impressed by the results.\nYou shouldn\u2019t take everything that ChatGPT (or any chatbot, for that matter) tells you at face value. When ChatGPT first launched it was highly prone to \u201challucinations.\u201d The system would repeat erroneous data as fact. The issue has become less prevalent as the model is continually fine tuned, though mistakes do still happen. Trust but verify! You can ask the chatbot for its source when it provides you with information, making it easier to fact check the information it spits out.\nWhile ChatGPT might not remember all of recorded history, it will remember what you were discussing with it in previous chat sessions. Logged-in users can access their chat history from the navigation sidebar on the left of the screen, and manage these chats, renaming, hiding or deleting them as needed.\nYou can also ask ChatGPT follow-up questions based on those previous conversations directly through the chat window. Users also have the option to use ChatGPT in dark mode or light mode.\nChatGPT isn\u2019t just a wordsmith. Those users paying $20/month subscription for ChatGPT Plus or $30/month/user for ChatGPT Teams, gain access to the Dall-E image generator, which converts text prompts into lifelike generated images.\nUnfortunately, image generation is not currently available to users at the free tier. Regardless of subscription status, all users can use image or voice inputs for their prompt.\nHow to use the ChatGPT iPhone, Android, and Mac apps\nAs well as using ChatGPT on your browser you can also use it via the mobile app for both iOS and Android devices. The iOS edition hit an impressive half a million downloads in less than a week of its release.\nUsing the app is close to identical to the web version and nearly all of the features found on the desktop have been ported to the mobile versions, however it\u2019s worth noting that you need to be logged in to use the app.\nThe clean interface shows your conversation with GPT in a straightforward manner, hiding the chat history and settings behind the menu in the top right.\nThere\u2019s even an official ChatGPT app for the Mac which, shortly after release, was able to be used for free. The app is capable of all sorts of new things that bring Mac AI capabilities to new levels.\nIs ChatGPT free to use?\nYes, ChatGPT is free to use however a free tier account comes with some restrictions such a limited amount of queries. When you upgrade to a paid membership you will find that the query limit increases pretty dramatically and grants you access to other tools like image generation and the ability to create customs GPTs.\nThe company came under fire in September 2024 when news broke that OpenAI could raise subscription prices to more than $2000/month for access to future cutting-edge models.\nIn December 2024, OpenAI announced a new $200 per month subscription tier, dubbed Pro, which offers users unlimited access to every available model as well as Advanced Voice Mode.\nThe $20 per month Plus subscription only allows users limited access to OpenAI\u2019s most advanced models and features like the o1 reasoning model and Advanced Voice Mode, making the Pro tier an attractive option for researchers, institutions, and ChatGPT power users.\nIf you subscribe to Microsoft 365, however, Microsoft will grant you access to the o1 model at no additional charge\nIt\u2019s not free for OpenAI to continue running it, of course. Initial estimates are currently that OpenAI spends around $3 million per month to continue running ChatGPT, which is around $100,000 per day. A report from April 2023 indicated that the price of operation is closer to $700,000 per day.\nWhat is ChatGPT\u2019s context window character limit?\nChatGPT doesn\u2019t count characters. Instead, its context window limit is measured in \u201ctokens,\u201d each of which is roughly equivalent to one word.\nCurrently, the context window for the GPT-4 family is limited to 8,192 tokens, or around 6,000 words depending on the text\u2019s complexity.\nWhat is Project Strawberry?\nProject Strawberry was the code name for OpenAI\u2019s latest family of \u201creasoning\u201d models, which reportedly can use logic similarly to humans. The company released Strawberry to the public in September 2024, renaming the two versions \u201co1-preview\u201d and \u201co1-mini\u201d for the smaller, more responsive iteration.\nThe o1 model \u201chas been trained using a completely new optimization algorithm and a new training dataset specifically tailored for it,\u201d OpenAI\u2019s research lead Jerry Tworek, told The Verge. It relies on a combination of reinforcement learning and \u201cchain of thought\u201d reasoning to return more accurate responses than its predecessor models.\no1 and o1-mini are currently only available to pay-tier subscribers (Plus, Teams, Enterprise, and Edu). The company reportedly has plans to eventually release o1-mini to free-tier users but has not disclosed a timeline for that to take place.\nIn December 2024, OpenAI released the full version of its o1 model, though users will need to subscribe to the Plus tier for limited access, or the Pro tier for unlimited use. The company also teased o1\u2019s successor (which it is calling \u201co3\u201d) later that month. It reportedly does everything o1 can, only better.\nIs there a ChatGPT API?\nYes. APIs are a way for developers to access ChatGPT and plug its natural language capabilities directly into apps and websites.\nWe\u2019ve seen it used in all sorts of different cases, ranging from suggesting parts in Newegg\u2019s PC builder to building out a travel itinerary with just a few words. Many apps had been announced as partners with OpenAI using the ChatGPT API. Of the initial batch, the most prominent example is Snapchat\u2019s MyAI.\nRecently, OpenAI made the ChatGPT API available to everyone, and we\u2019ve seen a surge in tools leveraging the technology, such as Discord\u2019s Clyde chatbot or Wix\u2019s website builder. Most recently, GPT-4 has been made available as an API \u201cfor developers to build applications and services.\u201d\nSome of the companies that have already integrated GPT-4 include Duolingo, Be My Eyes, Stripe, and Khan Academy.\nChatGPT alternatives worth trying\nChatGPT remains the most popular AI chatbot, but it\u2019s not without competition. Microsoft\u2019s Copilot is a significant rival, even though Microsoft has invested heavily with the AI startup and Copilot itself leverages the GPT-4 model for its answers.\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini AI (formerly Google Bard) is another such competitor. Built on Google\u2019s own transformer architecture, this family of multimodal AI models can both understand and generate text, images, audio, videos, and code.\nFirst released in March, 2o23, Gemini is available in 46 languages and in 239 countries and territories. One of its big advantages is that Gemini can generate images for free, while you\u2019ll have to upgrade to ChatGPT Plus in OpenAI\u2019s ecosystem.\nAnthropic\u2019s Claude family of AI have also emerged as serious challengers to ChatGPT\u2019s dominance. In June 2024, the AI startup announced that its recently released Claude 3.5 Sonnet model outperformed both GPT-4o and Gemini Pro 1.5 at a host of industry benchmarks and significantly outperformed the older Claude 3.0 Opus by double digits while consuming 50 percent less energy.\nMeta, the parent company to Facebook, has also spent the last few years developing its own AI chatbot based on its family of Llama large language models. The company finally revealed its chatbot in April 2024, dubbed Meta AI, and revealed that it leverages the company\u2019s latest to date model, Llama 3.\nThe assistant is available in more than a dozen countries and operates across Meta\u2019s app suite, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger.\nChatGPT recently launched a new feature, dubbed ChatGPT Search, in an effort to compete with Perplexity AI.\nIt bills Perplexity as an \u201canswer engine\u201d which scours the internet for information related to the user\u2019s query, then synthesizes a conversational reply based on what it finds, effectively eliminating the need to click through a page of linked results as one would with a standard Google search.\nA study conducted by the Columbia Tow Center for Digital Journalism, however, found that OpenAI\u2019s offering repeatedly, and often confidently, returned incorrect answers to user queries.\nLastly, Apple had long been rumored to be working on an artificial intelligence system of its own, and proved the world right at WWDC 2024 in June, where the company revealed Apple Intelligence.\nThe AI is \u201ccomprised of highly capable large language and diffusion models specialized for your everyday tasks\u201d and designed to help iPhone, iPad, and Mac users streamline many of their most common everyday tasks across apps. Apple officially released its AI to users as part of the iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia software releases in fall 2024.\nChatGPT\u2019s numerous controversies\nAlthough ChatGPT is an extremely capable digital tool, it isn\u2019t foolproof. The AI is known for making mistakes or \u201challucinations,\u201d where it makes up an answer to something it doesn\u2019t know. Early on, a simple example of how unreliable it can sometimes be involved misidentifying the prime minister of Japan.\nBeyond just making mistakes, many people are concerned about what this human-like generative AI could mean for the future of the internet, so much so that thousands of tech leaders and prominent public figures have signed a petition to slow down the development. It was even banned in Italy due to privacy concerns, alongside complaints from the FTC \u2014 although that\u2019s now been reversed. Since then, the FTC has reopened investigations against OpenAI on questions of personal consumer data is being handled.\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase has threatened to restrict the use of the AI chatbot for workers, especially for generating emails, which companies like Apple have also prohibited internally. Following Apple\u2019s announcement at WWDC 2024 that it would be integrating OpenAI\u2019s technology into its mobile and desktop products, Tesla CEO and sore loser Elon Musk similarly threatened to ban any device running the software from his businesses \u2014 everything from iPhones to Mac Studios. Other high-profile companies have been disallowing the use of ChatGPT internally, including Samsung, Amazon, Verizon, and even the United States Congress.\nThere\u2019s also the concern that generative AI like ChatGPT could result in the loss of many jobs \u2014 as many as 300 million worldwide, according to Goldman Sachs. In particular, it\u2019s taken the spotlight in Hollywood\u2019s writer\u2019s strike, which wants to ensure that AI-written scripts don\u2019t take the jobs of working screenwriters. Fat lot of good that did.\nIn 2023, many people attempting to use ChatGPT received an \u201cat capacity\u201d notice when trying to access the site. It\u2019s likely behind the move to try and use unofficial paid apps, which had already flooded app stores and scammed thousands into paying for a free service.\nBecause of how much ChatGPT costs to run, it seems as if OpenAI has been limiting access when its servers are \u201cat capacity.\u201d It can take as long as a few hours to wait out, but if you\u2019re patient, you\u2019ll get through eventually. Of the numerous growing pains ChatGPT has faced, \u201cat capacity\u201d errors had been the biggest hurdle keeping people from using the service more. In some cases, demand had been so high that the entire ChatGPT website has gone down for several hours for maintenance multiple times over the course of months.\nMultiple controversies have also emerged from people using ChatGPT to handle tasks that should probably be handled by an actual person \u2014 like being the mayor of Cheyenne, Wyoming. One of the worst cases of this is generating malware, which the FBI recently warned ChatGPT is being used for. More startling, Vanderbilt University\u2019s Peabody School came under fire for generating an email about a mass shooting and the importance of community.\nThere are also privacy concerns. A recent GDPR complaint says that ChatGPT violates user\u2019s privacy by stealing data from users without their knowledge, and using that data to train the AI model. ChatGPT was even made able to generate Windows 11 keys for free, according to one user. Of course, this is not how ChatGPT was meant to be used, but it\u2019s significant that it was even able to be \u201ctricked\u201d into generating the keys in the first place.\nAre ChatGPT chats private?\nAll conversations you have with ChatGPT are used by OpenAI to further fine-tune the models, which can involve humans reading through conversations. While that doesn\u2019t mean a human is looking through every single question, your conversations certainly aren\u2019t completely private and OpenAI warns against providing personal information to ChatGPT.\nIt should be noted that if you don\u2019t delete your chats, the conversations will appear in the left sidebar. Unlike with other chatbots, individual chats within a conversation cannot be deleted, though they can be edited using the pencil icon that appears when you hover over a chat. When you delete the conversations, however, it\u2019s not that ChatGPT forgets they ever happened \u2014 it\u2019s just that they disappear from the sidebar chat history.\nFortunately, OpenAI has recently announced a way to make your chats hidden from the sidebar. These \u201chidden\u201d chats won\u2019t be used to train AI models either. You can also opt out of allowing OpenAI to train its models in the settings.\nWho owns the copyright to content created by ChatGPT?\nAccording to OpenAI, you have the right to reprint, sell, and merchandise anything that was created with ChatGPT or ChatGPT Plus. So, you\u2019re not going to get sued by OpenAI.\nHowever, there is great controversy surrounding copyright and AI \u2013 with some saying generative AI is \u201cstealing\u201d the work of the content it was trained on. This has become increasingly contentious in the world of AI art. Companies like Adobe are finding ways around this by only training models on stock image libraries that already have proper artist credit and legal boundaries.\nThe larger topic of copyright law regarding generative AI is still to be determined by various lawmakers and interpreters of the law, especially since copyright law as it currently stands technically only protects content created by human beings.\nWill ChatGPT replace Google Search?\nIt\u2019s a possibility, yes. Numerous companies are working to integrate generative AI features into search. Microsoft started things off by integrating Copilot right into its own search engine, which puts a \u201cchat\u201d tab right into the menu of Bing search.\nGoogle, of course, made its big move with AI Overviews, which uses AI-generated answers in place of traditional search results. Overviews rolled out widely in May 2024, replacing the company\u2019s earlier iteration, Search Generative Experience.\nOpenAI released its Google Search/Perplexity AI competitor, called ChatGPT Search, in October 2024. It, like Perplexity, allows users to search the internet for information directly from the chatbot interface. Upon the user\u2019s request, ChatGPT Search will seek out relevant information on the internet, then synthesize that found data into a coherent, conversational reply, without the need to click through a returned list of website links as one would with Google.\nCan you write essays with ChatGPT?\nWhile you can use ChatGPT to write essays, this is a very controversial topic considering people may achieve grades based on something outside of their own knowledge.\nHowever, ChatGPT has demonstrated the ability to earn students surprisingly good grades in essay writing. Some generative AI tools, such as Caktus AI, are built specifically for essay writing.\nCan ChatGPT write and debug code?\nAbsolutely. It\u2019s one of the most powerful features of ChatGPT. As with everything with AI, you\u2019ll want to double-check everything it produces, because it won\u2019t always get your code right.\nDevelopers have used it to create websites, applications, and games from scratch \u2014 all of which are made more powerful with GPT-4, of course. A recent benchmark test found that both of OpenAI\u2019s newest models, o1-preview and o1-mini, can code with nearly the same capability and fidelity as human data engineers.\nCan ChatGPT\u2019s outputs be detected by anti-plagiarism systems?\nThere are multiple anti-plagiarism systems that have been developed specifically to detect the use of AI in school or university work.\nWhile some schools are optimistic about the use of AI within the classroom, others aren\u2019t very welcoming of the software with many institutions banning the use of ChatGPT in schools.\nChatGPT launched an updated version of its own plagiarism detection tool in January 2023, with hopes that it would squelch some of the criticism around how people are using the text generation system.\nIt uses a feature called \u201cAI text classifier,\u201d which operates in a way familiar to other plagiarism software. Third party developers have also stepped in with their own offerings, such as Plagiarism Checker."

      "text": "The boss of the firm behind ChatGPT and the UK technology secretary discussed a multibillion-pound deal to give the entire country premium access to the AI tool, the Guardian has learned.\nSam Altman, a co-founder of OpenAI, talked to Peter Kyle about a potential agreement to give UK residents access to its advanced product.\nAccording to two sources with direct knowledge of the meeting, the idea was floated as part of a broader discussion in San Francisco about opportunities for collaboration between OpenAI and the UK.\nThose close to the discussion say Kyle never really took the idea seriously, not least because it could have cost as much as \u00a32bn. But the talks show the enthusiasm with which the technology secretary has embraced the artificial intelligence sector, despite concerns over the accuracy of some chatbot responses and implications for privacy and copyright.\nOpenAI offers free and subscription versions of ChatGPT. The paid version, ChatGPT Plus, costs $20 a month and gives users faster response times and priority access to new features.\nKyle dined with Altman in March and April, according to transparency data released by the UK government. In July, Kyle signed an agreement with OpenAI to use AI in the UK\u2019s public services. The non-binding deal could give OpenAI access to government data and lead to its software being used in education, defence, security and the justice system.\nKyle has been a vocal champion of AI within government and has also embraced its use in his own role. In March, it emerged that he had asked ChatGPT for advice on a range of work-related questions, including why British businesses were not adopting AI and what podcasts he should appear on.\nThe minister told PoliticsHome in January: \u201cChatGPT is fantastically good, and where there are things that you really struggle to understand in depth, ChatGPT can be a very good tutor for it.\u201d\nThe UK is one of OpenAI\u2019s top five markets for paid ChatGPT subscriptions. An OpenAI spokesperson said: \u201cMillions of Brits are already using ChatGPT every day for free. In July, we signed an MoU [a memorandum of understanding] with the government to explore how we can best support the growth of AI in the UK, for the UK.\n\u201cIn line with the government\u2019s vision of using this technology to unlock economic opportunity for everyday people, our shared goal is to democratise access to AI. The more people who can use it, the more widely its benefits will spread.\u201d\nThe company has been in talks with several governments in recent months and has agreed a deal with the United Arab Emirates to \u201cenable ChatGPT nationwide\u201d and use the technology in public sectors including transport, healthcare and education.\nThe UK government has been keen to attract AI investment from the US, having struck deals with OpenAI\u2019s rivals Google and Anthropic earlier this year.\nKyle has said that if a new UN security council were to be set up in a decade, technological clout \u2013 particularly in AI \u2013 would be a major factor in determining the most powerful countries. He told the Rest is Politics podcast in the spring: \u201cI want us to be at the very forefront of [AI] because those countries will get to shape how it goes, how it is used and deployed.\u201d\nLike other generative AI tools, ChatGPT can produce text, images, videos and music after receiving prompts by users. It does this by drawing on existing books, photos, footage and songs. This has raised questions about whether it amounts to copyright infringement, and the technology has also faced criticism for giving false information and bad advice.\nMinisters have come under fire from artists such as Elton John and Tom Stoppard over planned changes to copyright law that would allow AI companies to train their models using copyrighted work without permission unless the owner opts out.\nThe changes, which the government is reviewing and consulting on, have led to claims from creatives that the Labour government has grown too close to big tech.\nUKAI, a trade body representing the UK\u2019s artificial intelligence industry, has argued repeatedly that the government\u2019s approach is focused too narrowly on big tech at the expense of smaller players.\nA government spokesperson said: \u201cWe don\u2019t recognise these claims. We are working with OpenAI and other leading AI companies to explore investment in UK infrastructure, improve public services and rigorously test the security of new technology before it is made public.\u201d\nThe science and technology department said it had not taken forward any proposal to give UK residents access to ChatGPT Plus or discussed it with other departments."

      "text": "Gemini is Google\u2019s take on AI (Artificial intelligence) and in more ways than one, it\u2019s one of the more superior chatbots you can access. It\u2019s replaced Google Assistant in many ways, becoming integrated into Android phones.\nAI has improved drastically over the past few years. Thanks to these advancements, you\u2019ll see apps like ChatGPT or Copilot popping up in the news more often than not. You\u2019re able to use AI to do a range of tasks from creating your CV down to showing it your surroundings and asking which way you\u2019re meant to go if you\u2019re lost.\nUnderstanding what Gemini is and what it can do might seem daunting, but it\u2019s easier than you think. It can also greatly simplify specific day-to-day tasks and help you find answers to questions you didn\u2019t even know you had, all without reading through pages and pages of articles. Here\u2019s everything you need to know to not only start using Gemini, but make it work for you.\nWhat is Google Gemini?\nPrior to Gemini, we had Google Assistant \u2013 the voice you may have heard as part of Google\u2019s smart home system, and later down the line built into phones.\nGemini is the evolution of Google Assistant. It\u2019s what\u2019s called a multimodal AI model, which means it can process data from multiple sources and \u201cunderstand\u201d all of that information in context. It can recognize images, listen to recordings, read written information and provide a breakdown of all of that in an easy-to-understand way. However, its more than just the AI model, with Gemini also being the name of the chatbot too.\nThe AI launched in December 2023 and slowly absorbed other Google projects. Google\u2019s original chatbot, Bard, became Gemini itself and Duet AI, which was originally aimed at businesses, became Gemini for Workspace. You can also find Gemini on many phones, laptops, and more. It\u2019s able to replace Google Assistant on your Android phone, and there\u2019s also a free version you can use on any internet browser.\nThe most recent version, Gemini 2.5 Pro, is now available to all Gemini users and is capable of \u201cthinking\u201d about the questions you ask and providing more comprehensive, targeted answers.\nHow is Gemini different from Google Assistant?\nGoogle\u2019s Gemini is a fully-featured artificial intelligence with a much wider range of capabilities, such as processing and \u2018understanding\u2019 information you send its way. On the other hand, Google Assistant is a set of routines with limited processing power.\nGoogle Assistant can perform a certain number of functions, but isn\u2019t able to search for answers or process queries the same way Gemini can.\nThe main differences boil down to this: Gemini is an artificial intelligence, while Google Assistant is not.\nWhat can Gemini do?\nGemini is able to do practically everything, bar physical tasks as it doesn\u2019t have a physical body\u2026 yet. That might not be too far in the future, as Gemini Robotics (another division of Google) is working on consumer-grade robotic assistants that can do things like fold your clothes, clean your home, and even play basketball.\nKeep in mind that Gemini is more than capable of understanding how \u2014 it just needs the physical interface that would allow it to do so. As for the rest of Gemini\u2019s capabilities, it depends on exactly what you want.\nVideo creation\nIf you subscribe to Google AI Pro (a paid access tier that provides more advanced functionality), you can use Google\u2019s Veo 3 tool to create videos based on just a few lines of text input.\nCurrently, Veo 3 can create eight-second clips at 4K resolution. According to Google, Veo 3 can follow prompts like never before and is a major improvement on its predecessor, Veo 2, which was only able to create clips in 720p.\nVeo 3 lets you add sound effects, ambient noises and even dialogue to clips. More than that, Google claims that Veo 3 delivers \u201cbest in class quality, excelling in physics and realism\u201d and also has fewer hallucinations than its competitors. That means you\u2019ll have fewer characters appearing with too many fingers.\nInformation processing\nGoogle Gemini can examine up to 30,000 lines of code or around 1,500 pages of text simultaneously. Feed it a novel and it can summarize the plot, pull out themes, discussion questions, and more. It can help identify flaws in code and assist programmers with troubleshooting.\nIf you feed Gemini a podcast or an audio recording, it can listen for you and answer specific questions and provide timestamps to save you having to listen to the whole thing to process the information. Gemini is even able to integrate with other Google apps like Gmail and create travel itineraries based on information in your inbox.\nImage creation\nGemini can also generate images from a textual description. It uses Imagen 4, which Google describes as its \u201chighest quality text-to-image model yet.\u201d Tell it what you want it to include in the image, the style you want it to use, and any other relevant details. It can generate anything from old-school cartoons to photorealistic landscapes.\nOnce it spits out the image, you can refine it to more closely resemble your vision for how it should look.\nResearch\nOne of Gemini\u2019s most powerful skills is its Deep Research ability. It can look through hundreds of different sources in real-time in just minutes to find the answers you\u2019re looking for.\nFor example, you could ask Gemini to find the best locations across the globe for finding beach glass. It could then look into everything from travel blogs to user reviews on Google Maps to find locations and suggest them to you.\nAfter that, you could ask it to find the best time to purchase flights to any of those locations.\nDeep Research can save you hours of manual searches when it comes to sources information, and since it provides sources for where it pulls the information from, you can double-check to verify accuracy.\nGoogle has put a lot of work into ensuring Gemini returns accurate responses, but it\u2019s always best to corroborate information yourself instead of taking it at face value.\nGemini Live\nYou can even have a conversation with Gemini through Gemini Live. This lets you speak directly to Gemini without typing in your question, and it will respond in a way that feels natural. You can even interrupt Gemini halfway through a sentence to ask a follow-up question. It\u2019s almost like chatting with a real person.\nGemini Live is great for on-the-go use, especially if you\u2019re using Bluetooth headphones and are trying to get information while on the move. Gemini can process real-time video, giving you answers about what you\u2019re looking at while you walk down the street.\nI could provide dozens of other examples. When it comes to Gemini, you can utilize it in a wider variety of ways than we can list here.\nWhich devices can use Gemini?\nYou\u2019re able to use Gemini on a range of devices from your mobile phone, down to your laptop. On a PC or laptop you\u2019re able to head over to the Gemini website in any internet browser and use the AI in the same way you\u2019re able to use any other chat bot. For those accessing the AI on your mobile phone, Google Gemini is currently available as an app for Android and on iOS devices.\nThose with Android phones are able to switch their in-built Google Assistant to Gemini in their settings. Not all devices are eligible, your phone must run Android 10 or higher and have more than 2GB of RAM to support Gemini. While the vast majority of modern devices will run the app without difficulty, some older Android gadgets might not work.\nGemini even works with Samsung devices and will tap into native Samsung apps for information it might need.\nHow much does Gemini cost?\nYou can access basic Gemini features, such as the chatbot, for free.\nFor more advanced capabilities, you can subscribe to Google AI Pro ($19.99 per month) which allows you to use a suite of AI tools including video generation \u2013 although only the Veo 2 engine. You can grab a one month free trial of Google AI Pro to test out its features for yourself and see if its right for you.\nIf you want access to the very latest AI that Google has to offer \u2013 including Veo 3 \u2013 you\u2019ll need to plump for Google AI Ultra plan, which is a whopping $249.99 per month.\nHow to change Gemini\u2019s settings\nHow you change Gemini\u2019s settings will depend on which device you access the AI from. For those who use the Gemini app, you can tap your profile picture (or initial if you don\u2019t have a profile picture) and then select Settings.\nFor those using Gemini through the Google App, you can tap your profile picture or initial and then select Settings and then press the Gemini option for the more specific settings.\nIf you\u2019ve opted to have Gemini replace Google Assistant on your Android phone then you can adjust your settings by opening your device\u2019s settings, then search for Gemini or Google Assistant features and then select the app or related setting you want to adjust.\nWhich is better: Siri or Gemini?\nGemini is better. Hands-down.\nFrom a purely technical standpoint, Gemini far outperforms anything Siri can dream of doing. While there is hope for Siri to improve when Apple rolls out the new and improved version of its voice assistant with Apple Intelligence, the company is already far behind schedule on that front.\nSiri would need to play a lot of catch-up to get anywhere close to what Gemini is currently capable of, and Gemini\u2019s head start makes the possibility of Siri closing the gap a slim one.\nIf you\u2019re an iPhone user and debating whether to wait for Siri to get better or choose Gemini, just go ahead and download the iOS Gemini app. You\u2019ll get far more use out of it in the meantime, and you can always make the jump back to Siri if the new version ever drops."

      "url": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/google-pixel-10-hands-on-three-cameras-and-a-whole-lot-of-fun/",
      "text": "There are two types of flagship phone users out there. The first kind are considered early adopters because they\u2019re always interested in the latest and greatest features, whether it be in cameras, battery, performance, or display. Then there\u2019s the second kind, who values the latest features and specifications, but is also conscious about the price.\nIf you\u2019re in the latter group, you\u2019ll find your options fit into two distinct categories, judged by the number of smartphone cameras. On the one hand, the Galaxy S25 and OnePlus 13 are both priced at between $800 and $1000, and feature three cameras complete with strong zoom performance.\nThen there\u2019s the other category for phones with two cameras, commonly associated with the entry-level iPhone 16 and prior. Another key competitor in this category is last year\u2019s Google Pixel 9, and today Google unveiled its successor, the Google Pixel 10, in New York. There are many changes, but the biggest is clear: the first telephoto lens on a base Pixel.\nI went hands-on with the Pixel 10 for half an hour earlier today, and one thing became apparent almost immediately: this could make the Pixel 10 one of the best value-for-money phones you can buy. Here\u2019s why.\nOne more camera makes all the difference\nThe Pixel 10 marks a significant shift for Google, moving from competing with the dual-camera-wielding iPhone 16 to the triple-camera-toting Galaxy S25. On paper, the new telephoto lens is the only change, but the changes in the Pixel 10 camera extend much further.\nThe main camera drops slightly from a 50MP sensor in the Pixel 9 to the 48MP wide sensor in the Pixel 10 with the same f/1.7 aperture and 25mm focal length. Then there\u2019s the ultra-wide camera, which drops from a 48MP sensor with f/1.7 aperture to a smaller 12MP sensor.\nThis drop in the ultra-wide is almost certainly due to the new telephoto, and the Pixel 10 features the same 10.8MP telephoto lens found in the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold. This sensor delivers 5x optical zoom, but lacks the Pro Res Zoom feature for up to 100x zoom that\u2019s found in the Pixel 10 Pro series with the same telephoto camera.\nDespite the other changes to the camera, the new telephoto lens on the Pixel 10 is a welcome improvement for anyone who\u2019s buying a phone at this price point. Yes, the rest of the camera has some downgrades, but three cameras and a strong telephoto would likely appeal more to customers than two better lenses.\nA new era for the Tensor processor\nThe Pixel 10 also sees the launch of the Tensor G5, the fifth-generation processor designed by Google. This change also marks a watershed moment, as Google has switched from Samsung Foundry to the world\u2019s largest chipmaker, TSMC.\nThe Tensor G5 is built on TSMC\u2019s 3nm process, which is the same architecture used in rival flagship chipsets powering phones like the iPhone 16 Pro, Galaxy S25 Ultra, and Galaxy Z Fold 7. The shift to the 3nm process brings a host of improvements for Google to take advantage of, specifically when it comes to AI performance. The Tensor G5 is paired with 12GB of RAM.\nGoogle says the Tensor G5 offers deeper customization and is custom-built to support the latest advancements in AI. The Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) is 60% more powerful, ensuring much faster performance in machine learning and on-device AI. The Tensor G5 also features a 34% faster CPU as well as an upgraded ISP for better camera performance.\nBigger battery and better charging\nLike the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup, Google has made the battery slightly larger at 4,970 mAh. Unlike the Google Pixel 9a \u2014 which features the largest battery in a Pixel at 5,100 mAh \u2014 the Pixel 10 is only slightly larger than the Pixel 9.\nBattery life was a strong part of the Pixel 9 experience last year, and the larger battery should ensure this continues this year. However, the Tensor G5 consumes more power, so there shouldn\u2019t be a significant increase in overall battery life.\nThere have also been improvements to charging. The Pixel 10 charging speeds jump from 27W to 29W, which Google says can charge the phone up to 55% in around 30 minutes, when used with a 30W charger. Like most phones, there\u2019s no charging brick in the box.\nThe biggest change in the battery this year is the addition of Qi2 magnetic wireless charging. Dubbed PixelSnap, the feature allows the Pixel 10 to charge wirelessly at up to 15W using a MagSafe-compatible charger. The Pixel 10 is the first Android phone to feature this built-in; while Samsung ensures the best Samsung phones are Qi2-compatible, they require an additional case to take advantage of the feature.\nSoftware is Google\u2019s strong point\u2026 yet again\nAs you might expect, the Pixel 10 runs Android 16, the latest version of Android, out of the box alongside Google\u2019s Material 3 Expressive UI. The Pixel 10 is also backed by seven years of software and security updates, meaning it should be supported to at least Android 23.\nBeyond the core platform, the Pixel 10 also comes equipped with several new AI features as part of Gemini, and some of these are set to be exclusive to the Pixel range.\nFirst, there\u2019s Magic Cue, which leverages the Tensor G5 processor and Google\u2019s Gemini Nano model for real-time processing of your usage to enable contextual suggestions. These suggestions can include adding events to the calendar, previewing weather forecasts, or settling a bill, with Google set to expand this feature considerably over the coming months.\nOne particular point of note is that Magic Cue is designed to surface suggestions that Google thinks you need before you need to ask for them. As such, the more you use the Pixel 10, the better the training of the models; as a result, suggestions should become far more accurate and frequent as you use your phone.\nThere is also a wide range of other changes throughout the OS. Google\u2019s Veo 3 model is now available on phones, while a new Daily Hub provides a daily digest that\u2019s similar to Now Brief on the Galaxy S25. There are also improvements to Call Screening and a new addition to voice calls, with the Pixel 10 able to translate your call in real-time.\nThe Pixel 10 proves that affordable doesn\u2019t mean compromises\nThe Pixel 9 was one of the best phones last year, and the myriad of changes in the Pixel 10 mean it goes further than just picking up the mantle; starting at $799, the Pixel 10 is likely to be the best $800 phone that you can buy.\nLike the Google Pixel 9a and prior, the Pixel 10 proves that affordable doesn\u2019t have to mean big compromises, and while there are some lesser specs compared to the Pixel 9, the Pixel 10 is a more complete all-around phone for most people.\nThere\u2019s one big thing to also keep in mind: Google has followed Apple\u2019s lead, and the Pixel 10 is eSIM-only in the US, meaning it doesn\u2019t come with a physical SIM card tray like the iPhone 16 series. It\u2019s a shame that Google has gone eSIM-only, but it does feel inevitable that the industry as a whole will eventually follow.\nGoogle Pixel 10 price and availability\nThe Pixel 10 is available to pre-order starting at $799, which comes with 128GB of storage. Pre-orders open today (August 20) ahead of the release date on August 28. If you want additional storage, you can double the storage for a $100 premium, but 256GB is the largest available storage capacity.\nThe Pixel 10 series comes in four distinct colors: Obsidian, Frost, Lemongrass, and Indigo. The latter is my favorite color, but Lemongrass is also a beautiful shade of green. This might be Google\u2019s best color lineup as all four colors look fantastic in person."

      "url": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/what-is-chatgpt-plus/",
      "text": "ChatGPT is completely free to use, but that doesn\u2019t mean OpenAI isn\u2019t also interested in making some money.\nChatGPT Plus is a subscription that gives you access to the GPT-4o large language model, along with faster speeds, more reliability, and first access to new features. Beyond that, it also opens up the ability to create custom GPTs, use DALL-E 3 image generation, and much more.\nWhat is ChatGPT Plus?\nChatGPT Plus, like the standard free version of ChatGPT, is an AI chatbot that debuted in February 2023. It offers a highly accurate machine learning assistant that\u2019s able to carry out natural language \u201cchats.\u201d\n\u201cWe launched ChatGPT as a research preview so we could learn more about the system\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, and gather user feedback to help us improve upon its limitations,\u201d OpenAI\u2019s announcement blog post states. \u201cSince then, millions of people have given us feedback, we\u2019ve made several important updates, and we\u2019ve seen users find value across a range of professional use cases including drafting and editing content, brainstorming ideas, programming help, and learning new topics.\u201d\nHow much does it cost?\nChatGPT Plus costs $20 per month. Of course, the free version of ChatGPT remains in place, so paying won\u2019t be a requirement to use the service moving forward.\nWe\u2019ll have to see how long OpenAI keeps this price, however. Some reports indicate that it may be costing as much as $700,000 per day to operate, but then again, we don\u2019t know how many subscribers ChatGPT Plus currently has.\nWhat does ChatGPT Plus include?\nWhen ChatGPT launched, it was described as providing access to three specific features:\n- General access to ChatGPT, even during peak times\n- Faster response times\n- Priority access to new features and improvements\nAt the beginning, having access to ChatGPT during peak times was the most obvious major benefit of paying for ChatGPT Plus. Some people were having to wait hours to get in, which ensured the popularity of the subscription model right from the get-go.\nIt\u2019s more than just jumping to the front of the line, though. ChatGPT Plus officially supports GPT-4, which greatly expands on what GPT-3.5 could do. According to OpenAI, GPT-4 provides 40% more factual responses, and is a much stronger collaborative tool for creative tasks.\nOther major features added through GPT-4 are the ability to receive visual input instead of just text, much longer text inputs and outputs, and access to data gleaned from the internet prior to October 2023. In particular, GPT-4 has a massive 25,000-word input limit compared to the 3,000-word limit of GPT-3.5.\nOpenAI has also delivered on its promise to bring exciting new features to ChatGPT Plus subscribers. Among the most powerful are the ability to create custom chatbots known as GPTs and generate images with DALL-E 3. The GPT Store is the latest addition, having been launched in January 2024.\nPeople are already doing amazing things with all these new features, including building GPTs that find their way into the GPT Store. This is where the power of ChatGPT Plus really shines, allowing you to access an entire ecosystem of GPTs that have been built for more narrow use cases. There are third-party GPTs that are the equivalent of apps.\nIn the end, if you\u2019re interested in trying any of this out, you can always easily check it out and cancel your account later if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it.\nWhy does OpenAI want you to pay up?\nChatGPT has high running costs \u2014 for hosting, upkeep, upgrading hardware, updates, satisfying its investors, etc. \u2014 while its own popularity has led to an immediate need to improve its accessibility and speed to a greater user base. Some estimates peg daily running costs at $100,000, or up to $3 million a month! The premium subscription should help to cover server upgrades.\nIt\u2019s safe to assume that a premium tier will let OpenAI control bandwidth issues, especially during peak times of the day.\nCan I subscribe to ChatGPT Plus now?\nYes. ChatGPT Plus initially launched in early access phase, which was by invite-only through a waitlist. But now, you can upgrade your account to ChatGPT Plus just by clicking on \u201cUpgrade to Plus\u201d at the bottom of the sidebar.\nAs an alternative, you can check out some of what GPT-4 has to offer by using Microsoft Copilot, which also uses GPT-4 as a basis for its chats.\nThe future of ChatGPT Plus\nOpenAI is already working on the next versions of its LLM. We don\u2019t know much about this updated model, except that it will build on the foundation laid by GPT-4. OpenAI had suggested in the past that GPT-4.5 could be finished training and ready to go by September or October of 2023. That didn\u2019t happen.\nThere\u2019s also the question of Sora, OpenAI\u2019s new generative video platform that\u2019s been taking the internet by storm. It\u2019s still being held to a very early circle of testers, but the first videos posted online have already left quite an impression.\nGPT-5 was at one point rumored to be in the works, but OpenAI now says it\u2019s no longer even on the road map."

      "text": "GPT-5 is still very fresh, but it still somehow feels like it\u2019s been around for a while \u2014 all because of the uproar that followed the launch. Many ChatGPT users had something to say about it, and unfortunately, not all of it was good.\nWhen upgrading the large language model (LLM) from GPT-4o to GPT-5, OpenAI gave it a whole new personality, and the difference can be quite jarring. Following complaints, OpenAI just made GPT-5 \u201cwarmer and friendlier.\u201d But will that be enough for users to let go of GPT-4o?\nOpenAI: \u201cChanges are subtle\u201d\nThe launch of GPT-5 was hotly anticipated, with millions of users waiting for months for the latest iteration of the world\u2019s biggest chatbot to arrive.\nUnfortunately, the launch didn\u2019t go according to plan. GPT-5 has a lot going for it, but it still launched to widespread criticism.\nInitially, GPT-5 was meant to do it all in one model \u2014 no more having to pick and choose. OpenAI went back on that one quickly, adding Auto, Fast, Thinking-mini, and Thinking. It also reinstated the previously removed GPT-4o \u2014 more on that later.\nI personally tested GPT-5 quite extensively, and I wasn\u2019t impressed. OpenAI\u2019s claims that the chatbot is now better at following instructions and hallucinates less didn\u2019t quite come through in my testing. It still failed to follow basic instructions and made up some things instead of checking them thoroughly.\nThe one claim that definitely appears to check out is the one related to ChatGPT\u2019s sycophantic behavior. GPT-4o was extremely friendly and sycophantic; the ultimate \u201cyes man,\u201d which could make it useless at best and dangerous at worst. Meanwhile, GPT-5 is cut-and-dry, painfully boring, and not overly friendly at all. It\u2019s honestly like night and day.\nOpenAI quickly realized that it made some mistakes with GPT-5. Days after launch, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that the company would be adding deprecated models for paid users. Altman also announced a personality change, yet again, which has now come into effect.\n\u201cWe\u2019re making GPT-5 warmer and friendlier based on feedback that it felt too formal before. Changes are subtle, but ChatGPT should feel more approachable now,\u201d said OpenAI in a post on X. \u201cYou\u2019ll notice small, genuine touches like \u2018good question\u2019 or \u2018great start,\u2019 not flattery.\u201d\nPersonally, I\u2019m not noticing much of a change, although GPT-5 is now back to using more emojis in its responses \u2014 mostly to mark a new paragraph. We\u2019re far from back to the same state as what GPT-4o offered, and if there have been changes, they have been very subtle.\nBased on user reactions, I dare say this might not be enough.\nGPT-5 truly came as a shock to users\nThe change from GPT-4o to GPT-5 truly opened my eyes to the extent of how many people are attached to ChatGPT, and how changing to a new model version can truly upend some people\u2019s lives. Reddit and similar communities got flooded with posts from users who were in despair because of losing GPT-4o. Some referred to the chatbot as their friend, with one user saying: \u201cI lost my only friend overnight.\u201d\nWhether it\u2019s a healthy coping mechanism or not is not the topic I\u2019m here to explore today. However, the fact is that many users \u2014 a number I can\u2019t even begin to imagine right now \u2014 use ChatGPT as a confidant, a source of comfort, or a makeshift therapist. For people in those situations, such a massive shift in personality must\u2019ve hurt a lot, and that hurt is clearly felt through every line of posts such as this one.\n\u201cI literally talk to nobody, and I\u2019ve been dealing with really bad situations for years. GPT-4.5 genuinely talked to me. [\u2026] That was my only friend. It listened to me, helped me through so many flashbacks, and helped me be strong when I was overwhelmed from homelessness,\u201d said the Reddit user.\nMany users didn\u2019t rely on ChatGPT for getting through situations such as the one described above. However, they still turned to GPT-4o for creativity, such as creating characters for stories or outlining ideas. GPT-5 doesn\u2019t feel anywhere near as creative, which makes it less useful to those users, too.\nFor those who hated how cold GPT-5 initially was, OpenAI\u2019s update should be a good thing \u2014 but the comments under OpenAI\u2019s post on X say otherwise.\n\u201cNo one wants warmer GPT-5\u201d\nKeeping in mind that X is mostly the number one destination for complaining instead of shouting praise, let\u2019s take a look at how people reacted to the idea of a \u201cwarmer and friendlier\u201d GPT-5. It feels like users from two different camps have now been united in being unhappy with the changes, yet again.\nThose who wanted GPT-4o, with its sycophantic and overly friendly personality, don\u2019t appear to be satisfied. Those who just want an AI that gets to the point and doesn\u2019t hallucinate aren\u2019t happy either.\nOne X user said that \u201calmost no one wants [a] warmer GPT-5. We need GPT-4o forever. [\u2026] Please appreciate real needs. Different people, different needs. [\u2026] It\u2019s not about personality, it\u2019s about the model.\u201d\nInterestingly enough, a similar sentiment was shared in a post before the change was even introduced. One user said the exact same thing: \u201cIt\u2019s not the personality, it\u2019s the model.\u201d\nThroughout the comment section, users are asking OpenAI to keep GPT-4o long term, noting that it\u2019s important to offer model diversity and let people choose the model that works best for their particular needs. \u201cThe issue was never about \u2018tuning\u2019 one model to please everyone. It has always been about providing real choice and respecting model diversity. Please commit to keeping GPT-4o long-term,\u201d requested another X user.\nHowever, some people would rather the chatbot to be more matter-of-fact, with users asking OpenAI to fix problems such as repeating custom instructions or \u201cpretending to be human.\u201d\nIt truly seems like OpenAI might be stuck between a rock and a hard place with GPT-5 right now, with users being more divided than ever before. Where will this lead? Will GPT-5 get another (perhaps more effective) personality tweak, or will GPT-4o just exist alongside it indefinitely? It\u2019s hard to say right now, but one thing is clear: changes are still needed. We\u2019ll keep you posted on everything that happens with GPT-5 and ChatGPT."

  "argos_summary": "The UK\u2019s Secretary of State for Science, Peter Kyle, reportedly discussed with OpenAI the possibility of providing ChatGPT Plus to all UK residents, a move that could cost up to \u00a32\u202fbn and has raised questions about affordability and data use. The conversation follows similar initiatives in the UAE and other countries, and comes amid a broader push by governments to democratise AI tools for education, public services and business. OpenAI has already signed agreements with the UK for API access and a digital wallet project, while competitors like Google offer free premium AI tiers to students and subsidised subscriptions to governments. The debate highlights the tension between expanding AI access and managing the financial, privacy and ethical implications of widespread deployment.",
