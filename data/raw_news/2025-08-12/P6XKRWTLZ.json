  "description": "It\u2019s the wurst-case scenario.",
  "content": "People are prone to toe injuries big and small in the summer because they\u2019re playing outside more, wearing less-protective footwear, such as sandals and flip-flops, and walking barefoot on hot surfaces like pavement and sand.\n\nA broken toe might seem like a minor inconvenience, but dismissing it means you\u2019re left with the dreaded, red and swollen \u201csausage toe\u201d \u2014 and must banish those toe-tally cute kitten heels and wedges to the back of the closet for now.\n\nIn the long term, you face the risk of persistent aches and pains, trouble walking, arthritis and even deformity.\n\n\u201cBroken toes are a common injury in my office during those warm months, but unfortunately, the patients come to me after thinking that the issue would resolve on its own,\u201d podiatrist and author Dr. Rock G. Positano told The Post.\n\n\u201cToo often,\u201d he added, \u201cpatients tell me in my office, \u2018I was told there\u2019s nothing you can do for a broken toe, so I didn\u2019t do anything!\u2019 Wrong.\u201d\n\nPositano and his son, Dr. Rock CJay Positano, are co-directors of the Non-Surgical Foot and Ankle Service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in NYC.\n\nThe Positanos focus on treating foot and ankle disorders without surgery.\n\nThey have their work cut out for them when one of the smaller toes gets injured.\n\nEven a minor impact on these little piggies can cause big pain because they contain many sensitive nerves and little natural cushioning.\n\n\u201cSmall toes don\u2019t equate to a small amount of pain,\u201d Dr. Rock CJay Positano said. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s quite the opposite.\u201d\n\nThe Positanos recommend seeing a doctor as soon as the injury occurs to undergo medical imaging.\n\nAn X-ray can help diagnose a broken or fractured toe, while an ultrasound examination of the forefoot can reveal a soft tissue, tendon or ligament injury.\n\nA short, removable walking cast (aka a boot) or a stiff-soled surgical shoe is a common treatment for a swollen, painful or fractured toe.\n\nThese may be worn for up to three or four weeks, depending on the severity of symptoms.\n\n\u201cMost patients note a considerable decrease in pain and discomfort when they immobilize the foot with one of these devices,\u201d Dr. Rock G. Positano said.\n\n\u201cSome patients may think flip-flops are a safe treatment option, but they can make pain and swelling of the toe more severe.\u201d\n\nThe Positanos caution that frank-en foot can happen year-round, not just in the summertime.\n\nThere are many hazards around the house \u2014 it\u2019s easy to fracture a toe by slamming it into the edge of furniture in the middle of the night or by dropping a can of soda on it at dinnertime.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t appreciate how important their feet are until they sustain an injury like this, one that seems small in scale, but as time passes, it becomes only more painful and can hinder one\u2019s lifestyle,\u201d Dr. Rock CJay Positano said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that a toe injury isn\u2019t life-threatening, but it can certainly be lifestyle-threatening.\u201d",

      "text": "I\u2019m a foot doctor \u2014 this popular summer shoe is a scary health risk\nTake a step in the right direction with your foot health this summer.\nA podiatrist has shared the warm-weather shoes he doesn\u2019t recommend because they could lead to injuries \u2014 and flip-flops are at the top of his blacklist.\nSingapore foot doc Paul Macaulay, better known as @paulthepodiatrist on TikTok, is warning viewers against wearing ultra-flat flip-flops.\n\u201cWe have a big issue here in Asia that everyone wears flip flops all the time, unfortunately some people aren\u2019t strong and fit enough to do so,\u201d Macaulay told The Post in an email Saturday.\n\u201cBiomechanical imbalances lead to overloading injuries such as plantar fasciitis and posterior tibial tendonitis.\u201d\nNot only do the casual sandals lack proper arch support, but they lack security as well, Macaulay said in a clip online.\n\u201cYour foot likely wants to have to grip onto it,\u201d he said, gesturing at the shoe.\n\u201cWith some people, you wear them for prolonged periods of time over many years, and your toes can start to stiffen and claw up, and then that can be hard to reverse,\u201d he added, showing a photo of a foot with a curled toe.\nClaw toe, according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, is often caused by wearing shoes that squeeze the toes or do not offer adequate support.\nWearing shoes with an extra strap around the heel is one way to prevent the disorder, said Macaulay, who boasts more than 17,700 followers on the app.\n\u201cThis will give more stability to the ankle and hold the foot in place,\u201d he explained. \u201cOr, you could even choose the style which has a strap coming over the front, which holds the foot down.\u201d\nSafety \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 is another problem accompanying the thong sandals.\nPeople whose mobility isn\u2019t good, Macaulay told The Post, are at risk of tripping and falling if they wear their flip-flops loosely.\nAnd for those with diabetes, Macaulay said, flip-flops allow the feet to become too dry, leading to cracked heels in some cases.\n\u201cDiabetics, especially Type 2 \u2026 often have conditions like neuropathy where they can\u2019t feel their feet,\u201d Macaulay explained.\n\u201cWearing flip flops, it can be easy to cut your foot and then that can lead to a bigger problem like an infected wound that could lead to an amputation if not cared for correctly.\u201d\nIn a subsequent videos, Macaulay describes the best footwear for women in the summer months and the shoes he would never wear as a podiatrist: slip-on loafers, stilettos, ballet flats, soft slip-ons and, of course, flip-flops.\n\u201cFlip flops are OK if worn for the right activity, if it\u2019s just from the car to the beach or to walk across the beach it\u2019s OK. Just wearing them to walk 5-10K steps would not be recommended as they have no support,\u201d Macaulay told The Post.\n\u201cI personally thing a slide style is better, with built-in arch support. A great American brand is OOFOS, they are great for preventing heel and forefoot pain.\u201d"

      "text": "About Dr. Positano\nDr. Rock CJay Positano, Co-Director of the Non-surgical Foot and Ankle Service, specializes in musculoskeletal podiatry, lower extremity biomechanics, gait analysis, and sports injury prevention in the active population. Although his residency program at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital consisted of surgical training, he elected to pursue the specialty of nonsurgical foot and ankle treatment and prevention.\nHis clinical and graduate work at the Yale School of Public Health/School of Medicine is focused on continuing to find new and innovative nonsurgical approaches and protocols to treating common and uncommon foot and ankle issues, where prevention is the main objective. In addition, Dr. Positano\u2019s research focuses on the role of the foot, ankle, and lower extremity in recognizing the presence of early systemic disease affecting all the body\u2019s systems such as rheumatologic ailments, cardiovascular ailments, neurologic ailments, and diabetes. Finally, Dr. Positano\u2019s clinical and scientific work at Yale specializes in foot epidemiology, which is the study of disease that affects the foot, ankle, and lower extremity.\nIn addition, Dr. Positano continues to publish scholarly articles in the areas of diagnostic, biomechanical, and treatment entities and is currently working on a textbook that incorporates those disciplines.\nBeing a multi-sport athlete all of his life, Dr. Positano has a unique understanding of how foot and ankle pathology can develop, whether in the athlete or active professional, and how improper foot/ankle function can adversely affect and cause knee, hip, and back disorders \u2013 ultimately impacting someone\u2019s quality of life. His approach emphasizes active rehabilitation and dynamic treatment that adjusts to the stages of healing and thereafter maintaining the musculoskeletal health of the patient. Dr. Positano strives to find solutions for foot and ankle issues that are outside of the box. He specializes in the design, fabrication, and proper application of prescription foot orthoses to treat specific foot and ankle pathology, as well as to treat conditions of the knee, hip, and lower back that are directly connected to abnormal foot structure and function. Dr. Positano\u2019s complementary interests in regenerative medicine, and how it can be a helpful adjunct to healing and pain management, add to this unique approach and bolster the arsenal of nonsurgical options offered to patients.\nDr. Positano has dedicated, and continues to dedicate, his professional education and training to pursuing all nonsurgical means of improving the patient\u2019s foot, ankle and lower extremity conditions and ultimately their quality of life \u2013 and only in those rare instances, where all non-surgical options have been exhausted, would he consider and recommend a surgical solution.\nSpecial Expertise\nHeel Pain - Commonly Misdiagnosed in Active Population Post-Pandemic\nHeel Pain, Very Common and Debilitating, Often Misdiagnosed as Plantar Fasciitis Has Become a Rampant Musculoskeletal Public Health Issue During the Post-Pandemic\nHeel pain is one of the most common ailments that is found in the active population. Unfortunately a painful heel can be severely debilitating if not properly diagnosed and treated. It may not be life threatening but it is certainly quality of life threatening and affects a person\u2019s ability to walk, stand, exercise and participate in social activities.\nHeel pain is the great impersonator and can signify a wide range of medical problems from a common musculoskeletal problem known as plantar fascia to a cancer metastasis in the heel bone from breast, prostate, lung and other areas. There is no such thing as simple heel pain and this complaint should never be trivialized and relegated to an internet search. All too often we will evaluate a patient who has had heel pain for over a year only to find that there is a more serious underlying problem such as a tear in the plantar fascia.\nInterestingly, heel pain is one of the most misdiagnosed musculoskeletal conditions. Physicians often misdiagnose heel pain as plantar fasciitis based on the clinical exam alone or in conjunction with an MRI, without performing a diagnostic ultrasound to rule out other possible causes. The wrong diagnosis can not only prolong a patient\u2019s suffering and decrease quality of life, but can do more harm than good if the incorrect treatment is prescribed. For example, it can lead to unnecessary surgery. Even worse, it can trigger serious systemic health issues such as cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, and depression, due to inactivity and lifestyle changes caused by pain.\nMany clinicians as well as the public often conclude that MRI should be the diagnostic test of choice when looking at a heel injury, however, technical advances and higher-frequency transducers have made diagnostic ultrasound technology more desirable than MRI in the diagnosis of foot pain, and it\u2019s much less costly and does not require an often claustrophobic environment associated with the MRI tube.\nWe published a 2015 study conducted by our Non-surgical Foot and Ankle Service and Heel Pain Center at Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) and found that a safe and painless diagnostic ultrasound test can pinpoint the exact cause of heel pain and ensure the most effective and safe treatment.\nOur findings led us to conclude that diagnostic ultrasound can effectively and safely identify the true cause of heel pain. The high prevalence of plantar fibromas and plantar fascial tears cannot be determined by clinical examination alone, and, therefore, ultrasound evaluation should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. This specialized diagnostic test could spare many people an incorrect diagnosis, potentially harmful treatment and needless suffering.\nThe pandemic has produced an unprecedented increase in foot problems, particularly in the heel.\nFoot pain isn\u2019t just a unidimensional issue. Our experience both anecdotally as well as scientific research has revealed that a painful foot will quite often cause pain and dysfunction elsewhere in the body especially the knee, hip and lower back. What starts in the foot most likely will travel up the motion chain to these other body parts.\nFoot, Ankle and Lower Extremity Joint Preservation\nDue to the tremendous forces sustained by the foot and ankle on a daily basis this non-surgical service developed specific therapeutic and preventive protocols that help to retard and prevent the rapid development of osteoarthritis as well as degeneration and damage to the numerous muscles, tendons and ligaments in the foot and ankle.\nTreatments that include therapeutic ultrasound, phonophoresis, and EPAT combined with a well- designed and prescribed foot orthoses used to stabilize and protect the foot has proven to be both beneficial, therapeutic and preventive in nature.\nThis benefit also extends to the knee, hip and lower back as improved foot and ankle function and shock absorbing ability is directly connected to decreased force and malalignment of these other parts of the lower extremity.\nType II Pre-Diabetes and Diabetes Musculoskeletal System Foot and Ankle Care\nDiabetes Mellitus is the most common metabolic disease in the world with a global prevalence reported up to ~451 million people and rising and a major source of our global disease burden. Type 2 Diabetes (DM2) accounts for >90% of all cases of diabetes types and typically affects active adults of all ages.\nOne of the heralding, and perhaps underdiagnosed, features of DM2 is its effect on the musculoskeletal system such as the foot, ankle, knee, shoulder, hip and spine (lower back/upper spine) in particular.\nThe excess glucose circulating around the body over an extended period of time will start to negatively affect the soft tissue structures supporting our joints contributing, but not exclusive, to common pathologies such as: 1) tendonitis 2) osteoporosis 3) osteoarthritis 4) muscle and foot cramping 5) limited joint mobility syndrome 6) peripheral neuropathy 7) circulatory compromise affecting arteries, veins and nerves.\nIf left untreated or mismanaged, these issues singularly, or in concert, will disrupt a person\u2019s quality of life because it will affect their ability to move as they please and participate in exercise and walking activity.\nThis can prove troubling especially if the person leads a motivated and active lifestyle, and can further precipitate the negative cascade of increasing the risk of developing more serious chronic systemic diseases especially involving the cardiovascular system and maintenance of weight control and DM2 related monitoring levels of insulin/glucose indicators such HbA1c, insulin resistance, Body Mass Index (BMI) and other metabolic factors.\nMusculoskeletal issues affect the DM-2 patient\u2019s ability to exercise which is imperative to improve cardiovascular function, maintain blood pressure and bone density, anxiety and stress reduction just to name a few.\nDM2 patients have specific needs and prevention strategies when dealing with musculoskeletal issues especially if the patient would wish to begin an exercise program or maintain a current one to best avoid injury.\nThis is the first practice of this kind that directly addresses the musculoskeletal needs of DM2 patients and has the participation of multiple health care practitioners, a specially trained NP (Nurse Practitioner), MD (Medical Doctor), DPM (Doctor of Podiatric Medicine), DC (Doctor of Chiropractic) and a Motion Gait Analysis facility that provides the patient with the ultimate comprehensive musculoskeletal care team approach.\nInsurance\nIf your insurance is not listed, please call our office if you have questions regarding your insurance coverage. If you have out-of-network benefits, then your insurance may reimburse you for a portion of your office visit.\nCredentials\nAppointments\nCo-Director of the Non-surgical Foot and Ankle Service, specializing in musculoskeletal podiatry, lower extremity biomechanics, gait analysis, and sports injury prevention in the active population.\nEducation\nPost Graduate Medical Education:\nYale School of Public Health/School of Medicine\nMaster of Public Health\nPreventive Medicine - Foot/Ankle/Lower Extremity\nMedical Education:\nNew York College of Podiatric Medicine/Foot Clinics of New York (Doctor of Podiatric Medicine)\nResidency:\nPodiatric Medicine, Surgery and Orthopedics, New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical College\nState Licensure\nNew York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida\nLanguages\nEnglishFor My Patients\nPublications by Dr. Positano\nPatient Education\nSelected Journal Articles\nResearch\nClinical Trials / Research Studies\nIndustry Relationships\nHSS has a long history of supporting appropriate relationships with industry because they advance HSS's mission to provide the highest quality patient care, improve patient mobility, and enhance the quality of life for all, and to advance the science of orthopedic surgery, rheumatology, and their related disciplines through research and education.\nAs of March 28, 2023, Dr. Positano reported no relationships with the healthcare industry.\nHSS and its physicians make this information available to patients and the public, thus creating a transparent environment for those who are interested in this information.

This can lead to infection, which may then be carried to the brain.\nComplications can include blindness, stroke, paralysis and even death.\nAnother TikTokker named Hope (@imlesbianflavored) revealed in 2023 that in her case, it lead to a staph infection that was \u201cworse than childbirth\u201d and left her with a scar.\nWell aware of the \u201ctriangle of death,\u201d Lish knew she got lucky: \u201cI think I caught mine extremely quick, within hours so I\u2019m on a ton of meds,\u201d she said.\nTwenty-four hours later she was doing better, though she noted that her smile was still a bit \u201ccrooked,\u201d and three days later she was \u201c100% back to normal.\u201d\nWhile lots of commenters chimed in to say that they\u2019d popped plenty of pimples in the area without incident, others shared similarly scary experiences.\n\u201cHappened to my daughter. We spent a week in the hospital and she had to have surgery on her face,\u201d wrote one mom, while another said her son was hospitalized when his turned into a staph infection.\n\u201cI almost died from this. It\u2019s no joke, was hospitalized for a week and a half and had surgery,\u201d wrote yet another commenter.\nIf you absolutely must pop a pimple \u2014 after trying a spot treatment or pimple patches \u2014 dermatologist Dr. Mamina Turegano says to begin by sterilizing your hands and the area with rubbing alcohol.\n\u201cThen poke the pimple with a diabetic lancet, which has a very tiny needle, to open the surface with a small prick that \u201cwon\u2019t cause too much damage,\u201d she said in an Instagram video.\nApply slight pressure with two cotton swabs to let the contents drain out.\n\u201cWhen popping a pimple it\u2019s very important that you\u2019re not applying a lot of pressure otherwise you\u2019re gonna get a lot more inflammation and result in scarring,\u201d Turegano advised.\nBut she, too, advises against touching anything in the \u201ctriangle of death.\u201d\n\u201cReally, don\u2019t mess with it. Spot treatment it or see a derm,\u201d Tuergano insisted.\nNY Post Picks\nThe COSRX Acne Pimple Patch uses a clear hydrocolloid barrier to protect blemishes from bacteria while absorbing excess oil and impurities.

She hadn\u2019t felt a thing.\nBecause of the size, her doctor ordered an Ova1 blood test to check if it was cancerous. The results came back negative, as did a second test a month later.\nStill, the cyst remained, and she followed through on her doctor\u2019s suggestions to remove her ovaries. She didn\u2019t plan on having more kids.\nBut when the surgeon set to perform the procedure saw her ultrasound, a grave look crossed his face.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to scare you because your test came back negative, but I don\u2019t like the way things are looking,\u201d he told Altese-Isidori. \u201cI need to get you in as soon as possible to have your ovaries removed.\u201d\nSigning her life away \u2014 or saving it\nOn Dec. 20, Altese-Isidori went under the knife for what she thought would be a routine procedure.\n\u201cWhen he went in, he was able to see that I was filled with cancer,\u201d she said.\nA biopsy confirmed the diagnosis: Stage 4B ovarian cancer, the most advanced form of the disease, meaning it had already spread to distant organs.\nIn the US, only 31% of people diagnosed at that stage are alive five years later, according to the Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance.\n\u201cI was in complete shock. I kept waiting for someone to say they made a mistake,\u201d Altese-Isidori said.\nShe and her husband, chef Joe Isidori, sprang into action. Within days, she\u2019d landed a spot at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, where she was placed under the care of Dr. Dennis Chi, head of the hospital\u2019s Ovarian Cancer Surgery Section.\n\u201cI feel very lucky in an extremely unlucky situation, because all of my stars aligned,\u201d Altese-Isidori said.\nOn Jan. 15, she was back on the operating table.\nAs she signed pre-op papers, Altese-Isidori told her husband she felt like she was \u201csigning her life away\u201d \u2014 initialing every worst-case scenario listed in the fine print.\n\u201cThe doctor heard me, and he said, \u2018No you\u2019re not, you\u2019re giving me permission to save your life,\u2019\u201d Altese-Isidori said.\nThat was the turning point. \u201cIt was like something clicked in my mind,\u201d Altese-Isidori said. \u201cI got such strength from his words, it gave me so much motivation.\u201d\nLife goes on \u2014 seven organs lighter\nAltese-Isidori\u2019s incision scar stretched all the way up her torso.\n\u201cWhen he went in, there was cancer in my colon, my liver, it was already in my chest \u2014 and I had felt completely fine,\u201d she said.\nChi had removed her spleen, appendix, gallbladder, uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes and the lining of her stomach, all riddled with cancer.\nSeven organs lighter, Altese-Isidori couldn\u2019t help but wonder: Had she lost any weight?\n\u201cThat\u2019s going to give me five pounds,\u201d she remembers thinking. \u201cBut I was so disappointed, we Googled it and added it all up and it was like 10 ounces. It was ridiculous,\u201d she said with a laugh.\nChi managed to spare part of her liver and colon, but she needed a colostomy bag attached to a small opening in her lower abdomen where waste would exit her body.\nShe stayed in the hospital for 18 days, finding strength in \u201cmirror talks.\u201d \u201cI would tell myself, \u2018Alright, enough already. Enough of the pity party. We have a lot left to do,'\u201d she said.\nChemo, which started a week later, was \u201cmental warfare,\u201d though she mostly had a \u201creally easy run\u201d through six rounds, which were split between MSK and the Miami Cancer Institute in Florida.\nAside from fatigue, body aches and losing all her hair, she waited for the worst \u2014 and was surprised when it didn\u2019t come.\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything really major compared to what I thought it would be,\u201d she said, crediting IV hydration every few days.\nOver time, Altese-Isidori adjusted to life with the colostomy bag. Slowly, glimpses of her old self returned.\n\u201cI was wearing sweatpants in the beginning, but eventually, I was like, you know what? Screw this. I\u2019m getting dressed up,\u201d she said. Soon, she was strutting into doctor\u2019s appointments in her favorite dress and heels.\nA new chapter begins\nRecently, she had surgery to remove the colostomy bag. Then came the best news yet: Her CA 125 test \u2014 which measures a protein often elevated in women with ovarian cancer \u2014 had returned to normal levels.\n\u201cI\u2019m technically in remission,\u201d she said.\nShe celebrated with a \u201cremission cake\u201d alongside loved ones, including her 8-year-old son, Roman, and 94-year-old mother.\n\u201cMy hair is starting to grow back, and I feel good,\u201d she said, but added that she thinks she\u2019ll always be in fight mode.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to let my guard down, I feel like there\u2019s evil eyes lurking somewhere that are watching me,\u201d she admitted.\nFor Stage 4 ovarian cancer patients, the chance of recurrence can be as high as 95%, according to the OCRA.\n\u201cTo think that at seven months I won and I beat it for life is silly. But today I\u2019m OK,\u201d she said, noting that she\u2019s taking a daily PARP inhibitor pill, a type of targeted therapy, which can delay or stop cancer\u2019s return.\n\u201cI want to redefine the face of stage four cancer,\u201d she said. \u201cI want people to know that you could still have a full life \u2014 even with a colostomy bag.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that there\u2019s a lot of hope,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s not a dead end.\u201d\nThe whisper killer\nNow, Altese-Isidori is raising awareness about ovarian cancer, urging women to push for early screening.\n\u201cMaybe I took one for the team [and] now there\u2019s a woman behind me who doesn\u2019t have to,\u201d she said.\nWhile she had no symptoms, there are often warning signs \u2014 but they\u2019re typically so subtle, many women overlook them. That\u2019s why it\u2019s known as \u201cthe whisper killer.\u201d\nCommon symptoms include bloating, fatigue, feeling full quickly, changes in bowel or bladder habits and pelvic, back or abdominal pain.\n\u201cThe biggest thing is persistence,\u201d said Jennifer McGrath, executive director of Hearing the Ovarian Cancer Whisper, a nonprofit working to raise awareness about the condition. \u201cIf something lasts longer than a few weeks, you\u2019ve got to get in to see a doctor.\u201d\nMcGrath urges women, especially those with a family history, to ask their doctors for a CA 125 blood test. Though it\u2019s usually reserved for women already diagnosed with ovarian cancer, it can help establish a personal baseline that may prove useful down the road.\nAltese-Isidori and McGrath also recommend that women get an annual transvaginal ultrasound, even if they aren\u2019t postmenopausal, the age group ovarian cancer typically affects.\n\u201cOver the last 10 years, a lot of younger women are getting it,\u201d McGrath said. \u201cBut it\u2019s really not one of those cancers that I believe doctors are necessarily trained to screen for, you have to ask for it.\u201d\nIn the US, a woman\u2019s lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer is about 1 in 91, according to the American Cancer Society. In 2025, they estimate that about 20,890 women will be diagnosed with the disease, and 12,730 women will die from it."

      "text": "About Dr. Positano\nDr. Rock G. Positano has been on staff at HSS since 1991 and is nationally known for his non-surgical approach for the treatment of foot disorders. He serves in the capacity of Founder and Director of the Non-surgical Foot and Ankle Service and the Heel Pain Center at HSS. Dr. Positano was featured on the front page of the New York Times in an article concerning the dangers of cosmetic foot surgery. He has authored and edited numerous peer reviewed articles and has served as the editor of 12 medical textbooks ranging from foot and ankle orthopedics, heel disorders, to sports medicine. His thesis on Foot Health was approved 'With Honors' and 'With Distinction' by the faculty of the Yale School of Medicine.\nDr. Positano specializes in musculoskeletal podiatry, the non-surgical diagnosis and treatment of muscle, tendon, ligament, and bone disorders of the foot and ankle using physical therapy protocols/modalities and prescription foot orthoses. In addition, musculoskeletal podiatry involves evaluating and treating biomechanical relationships of how the foot affects knee, hip, and back function and pathology using prescription foot orthoses.\nSpanish: Espa\u00f1ol (pdf)\nItalian: Italiano (pdf)\nFrench: Fran\u00e7ais (pdf)\nGerman: Deutsch (pdf)\nPortuguese: Portugu\u00eas (pdf)\nTurkish: T\u00fcrk\u00e7e (pdf)\nGreek (pdf)\nJapanese (pdf)\nChinese (pdf)\nArabic (pdf)\nKorean (pdf)\nRussian (pdf)\nHebrew (pdf)\nMost common conditions treated in the field of musculoskeletal podiatry includes:\n- Heel/rearfoot pain\n- Plantar fasciitis/arch pain\n- Forefoot pain\n- Heel spur syndrome\n- Achilles tendonitis/Haglund\u2019s Deformity/Retrocalcaneal bursitis\n- Ankle sprains\n- Metatarsal problems\n- Neuromas\n- Bunion deformity/arthritis 1st MPJ or 1st MPJ dysfunction\n- Shin splint syndrome/medial tibial stress syndrome\n- Simple, closed, non-displaced fractures\n- Pes planus (flat foot)\n- Cavus foot\n- Stress fractures\n- Sesamoid injuries\n- Peroneal, anterior, and posterior tibial tendonitis/tendinosis\n- Generalized foot pain and discomfort\n- Cycling and ski boot injuries\n- Midtarsal/Ankle joint osteoarthritis\n- Orthotic prescription and fabrication\n- Podiatric biomechanical correction of knee, hip, and back disorders\n- Acute gout\n- Sports injury prevention\n- Children\u2019s foot disorders - metatarsus adductus (in toe), flat foot, etc\n- Type 2 (not Type 1) diabetic foot care and prevention (excluding ulcers or open wounds)\nAs the founder and director of the Non-surgical Foot and Ankle Service, he is dedicated to evaluating the majority of foot and ankle problems that often can be treated successfully without surgery. This service is the very first in the greater New York area located at a major orthopedic teaching hospital dedicated to orthopedic/musculoskeletal care and research in developing non-surgical treatments for foot and ankle ailments as well as optimizing the relationship between foot function and the effects on the knee, hip and lower back disorders.\nThe Service is nationally renowned for its expertise in the design and fabrication of prescription foot orthotics used to treat many orthopedic foot and ankle problems. In addition, foot orthotics are prescribed to treat biomechanically related problems involving the knee, hip, and lower back, as these conditions are often responsive to the stability and improved mechanics that these devices provide.\nThe Service treats non-complicated fractures of the foot/ankle and has a direct affiliation and access to the Sports Medicine Institute, the Orthopedic Trauma Service (OTS) at HSS and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center, the Limb Lengthening and Deformity Service, and the Orthopedic Service of the Department of Surgery at MSKCC.\nThe Non-surgical Foot and Ankle Service provides access to state of the art diagnostic testing that includes diagnostic ultrasound, computerized motion and gait analysis, bone densitometry, MRI, CAT scan, X-rays, and bone scans.\nSpecial Expertise\nCustom Orthotics\nHeel Pain\nHeel Pain, Very Common and Debilitating, Often Misdiagnosed as Plantar Fasciitis Has Become a Rampant Musculoskeletal Public Health Issue During the Post-Pandemic\nHeel pain is one of the most common ailments that is found in the active population. Unfortunately a painful heel can be severely debilitating if not properly diagnosed and treated. It may not be life threatening but it is certainly quality of life threatening and affects a person\u2019s ability to walk, stand, exercise and participate in social activities.\nHeel pain is the great impersonator and can signify a wide range of medical problems from a common musculoskeletal problem known as plantar fascia to a cancer metastasis in the heel bone from breast, prostate, lung and other areas. There is no such thing as simple heel pain and this complaint should never be trivialized and relegated to an internet search. All too often we will evaluate a patient who has had heel pain for over a year only to find that there is a more serious underlying problem such as a tear in the plantar fascia.\nInterestingly, heel pain is one of the most misdiagnosed musculoskeletal conditions. Physicians often misdiagnose heel pain as plantar fasciitis based on the clinical exam alone or in conjunction with an MRI, without performing a diagnostic ultrasound to rule out other possible causes. The wrong diagnosis can not only prolong a patient\u2019s suffering and decrease quality of life, but can do more harm than good if the incorrect treatment is prescribed. For example, it can lead to unnecessary surgery. Even worse, it can trigger serious systemic health issues such as cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis, and depression, due to inactivity and lifestyle changes caused by pain.\nMany clinicians as well as the public often conclude that MRI should be the diagnostic test of choice when looking at a heel injury, however, technical advances and higher-frequency transducers have made diagnostic ultrasound technology more desirable than MRI in the diagnosis of foot pain, and it\u2019s much less costly and does not require an often claustrophobic environment associated with the MRI tube.\nWe published a 2015 study conducted by our Non-surgical Foot and Ankle Service and Heel Pain Center at Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) and found that a safe and painless diagnostic ultrasound test can pinpoint the exact cause of heel pain and ensure the most effective and safe treatment.\nOur findings led us to conclude that diagnostic ultrasound can effectively and safely identify the true cause of heel pain. The high prevalence of plantar fibromas and plantar fascial tears cannot be determined by clinical examination alone, and, therefore, ultrasound evaluation should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. This specialized diagnostic test could spare many people an incorrect diagnosis, potentially harmful treatment and needless suffering.\nThe pandemic has produced an unprecedented increase in foot problems, particularly in the heel.\nFoot pain isn\u2019t just a unidimensional issue. Our experience both anecdotally as well as scientific research has revealed that a painful foot will quite often cause pain and dysfunction elsewhere in the body especially the knee, hip and lower back. What starts in the foot most likely will travel up the motion chain to these other body parts.\nFoot, Ankle and Lower Extremity Joint Preservation\nDue to the tremendous forces sustained by the foot and ankle on a daily basis this non-surgical service developed specific therapeutic and preventive protocols that help to retard and prevent the rapid development of osteoarthritis as well as degeneration and damage to the numerous muscles, tendons and ligaments in the foot and ankle.\nTreatments that include therapeutic ultrasound, phonophoresis, and EPAT combined with a well- designed and prescribed foot orthoses used to stabilize and protect the foot has proven to be both beneficial, therapeutic and preventive in nature.\nThis benefit also extends to the knee, hip and lower back as improved foot and ankle function and shock absorbing ability is directly connected to decreased force and malalignment of these other parts of the lower extremity.\nPregnancy and Foot and Ankle Care\nIt has been well established that in addition to soft tissue and hormonal changes, the lower extremity and especially the foot and ankle, undergoes various structural and functional changes throughout the course of pregnancy. These lower extremity and foot changes can continue into, or even advance beyond, the postpartum period. Each trimester of pregnancy carries certain challenges that the lower extremity, and especially the foot and ankle, have to overcome for the patient to maximize their quality of life.\nAs the fetus grows in both size and weight, there is a gradual shift in the expectant patient\u2019s center of gravity due to increased volume within the gravid uterus. This shift, along with increased gravitational pull of increased BMI, in turn creates a stronger fulcrum, or bending/pivot force, on the lower extremity which increases demand on the lower extremity and foot, forcing it to compensate in order to maintain the proper musculoskeletal balance needed for metabolically efficient walking to occur.\nIncreased \u2018turning in\u2019 (or pronation) of the foot with consequent turning in (or internal rotation) of the lower leg, due in part to both the dimensional and volumetric changes of the growing fetus, increases stresses throughout the entire length of the foot and in particular the arch and heel of the foot, especially during walking or weight bearing activities.\nTo add, whatever foot and ankle pathology or morphology that may have existed before the onset of pregnancy (whether properly addressed or not) risks being further exacerbated, or even uncovered, by the various anatomic and physiologic changes brought on by pregnancy.\nConditions such as heel pain, ankle pain, bunion pain, lower leg pain, knee, hip and lower back discomfort are very common during and after the pregnancy. These conditions left untreated can cause major discomfort in the expectant mother.\nRead more: Foot Problems During and After Pregnancy\nType II Pre-Diabetes and Diabetes Musculoskeletal System Foot and Ankle Care\nDiabetes Mellitus is the most common metabolic disease in the world with a global prevalence reported up to ~451 million people and rising and a major source of our global disease burden. Type 2 Diabetes (DM2) accounts for >90% of all cases of diabetes types and typically affects active adults of all ages.\nOne of the heralding, and perhaps underdiagnosed, features of DM2 is its effect on the musculoskeletal system such as the foot, ankle, knee, shoulder, hip and spine (lower back/upper spine) in particular.\nThe excess glucose circulating around the body over an extended period of time will start to negatively affect the soft tissue structures supporting our joints contributing, but not exclusive, to common pathologies such as: 1) tendonitis 2) osteoporosis 3) osteoarthritis 4) muscle and foot cramping 5) limited joint mobility syndrome 6) peripheral neuropathy 7) circulatory compromise affecting arteries, veins and nerves.\nIf left untreated or mismanaged, these issues singularly, or in concert, will disrupt a person\u2019s quality of life because it will affect their ability to move as they please and participate in exercise and walking activity.\nThis can prove troubling especially if the person leads a motivated and active lifestyle, and can further precipitate the negative cascade of increasing the risk of developing more serious chronic systemic diseases especially involving the cardiovascular system and maintenance of weight control and DM2 related monitoring levels of insulin/glucose indicators such HbA1c, insulin resistance, Body Mass Index (BMI) and other metabolic factors.\nMusculoskeletal issues affect the DM-2 patient\u2019s ability to exercise which is imperative to improve cardiovascular function, maintain blood pressure and bone density, anxiety and stress reduction just to name a few.\nDM2 patients have specific needs and prevention strategies when dealing with musculoskeletal issues especially if the patient would wish to begin an exercise program or maintain a current one to best avoid injury.\nThis is the first practice of this kind that directly addresses the musculoskeletal needs of DM2 patients and has the participation of multiple health care practitioners, a specially trained NP (Nurse Practitioner), MD (Medical Doctor), DPM (Doctor of Podiatric Medicine), DC (Doctor of Chiropractic) and a Motion Gait Analysis facility that provides the patient with the ultimate comprehensive musculoskeletal care team approach.\nInsurance\nIf your insurance is not listed, please call our office if you have questions regarding your insurance coverage.

      "text": "Trillions of microplastics are released by this super popular cleaning tool every month\nTalk about a dirty little secret.\nA popular cleaning tool might leave your counters sparkling, but new research shows that the household staple is quietly shedding trillions of microplastics into the environment every month.\nThose pesky particles don\u2019t just disappear. They seep into the food you eat, the water you drink and the air you breathe. Eventually, they wind up in your body, too \u2014 and early evidence suggests they could be doing serious damage once they get there.\nBehind the magic\nScientists from the American Chemical Society took a closer look at so-called \u201cmagic\u201d sponges, popular for their ability to remove grit and grime using water alone.\nTheir scrubbing power comes from melamine foam, a lightweight yet durable plastic that acts like ultra-fine sandpaper to gently scrape away dirt and stains from surfaces.\nBut with every use, the sponges gradually breaks down, shedding tiny fibers called microplastics in their wake.\nTo get a sense of how much plastic is being released, researchers tested sponges from three popular brands by rubbing them against textured metal to mimic everyday wear and tear.\nWhat they found was far from squeaky clean: A single sponge shed around 6.5 million microplastic fibers per gram of worn-down material.\nFrom there, the team turned to Amazon sales data from August 2023. Assuming the average sponge is worn down by about 10% through regular use, they estimated that 1.55 trillion microplastic fibers could be leached into the environment every month.\nAnd that\u2019s just from one online retailer \u2014 meaning the true number of plastic particles being released by \u201cmagic\u201d sponges could be much higher.\nTiny particles, big trouble\nOnce unleashed into nature, microplastics don\u2019t just pollute the planet. They find their way inside our bodies.\nThese sneaky specks been found in human lungs, livers, kidneys, hearts, brains, placentas and testicles, even breast milk and semen.\nScientists are still figuring out exactly how this affects our health, but early results aren\u2019t encouraging. In January, a major scientific review found that exposure to microplastics may pose risks to the human digestive, reproductive and respiratory systems.\nResearch suggests that these particles can damage cells, disrupt organs and mess with the immune system. They\u2019ve also been linked to an increased risk of heart attack, stroke and certain cancers.\nMicroplastics may even harm the brain, potentially causing symptoms like fatigue and dizziness. Higher levels have been found in people with dementia.\nIt\u2019s a huge problem for something so tiny \u2014 and a costly one too. One study found microplastics carrying \u201cforever chemicals\u201d in the US food and water supply could be fueling a $250 billion-a-year health crisis.\nScrub smarter\nTo cut down on microplastics, researchers from the American Chemical Society are urging manufacturers to make denser, tougher sponges that don\u2019t break down so easily.\nThey also suggest consumers opt for natural cleaning products without plastics and install filters to catch microplastics in their drinking water.\nTo lower your overall exposure, experts recommend cutting back on single-use plastic bags, bottles, straws and containers.\nChoosing clothes made from natural fibers instead of synthetics and avoiding microwaving food or drinks in plastic can also help reduce your risk.\nStill worried about those tiny troublemakers?\nSpecial washing machine filters can trap microplastics from your laundry before they hit the environment, and new blood-filtration treatments might even help flush them from your body."

Let me repeat that \u2014 all day long.\nBelow, find the bonafide picks I\u2019d wear any day of the week.\nBest Overall: Dream Pairs Wonder Cloud Kitten Heel Sandals\nPros:\n- Truly dreamy to walk in\n- Great for any occasion\n- The ankle strap and toe band offer added security and comfort\nCons:\n- Some may prefer the sculpted heel to be a bit straighter\nOne of my most-recommended heels to my friends, family members, work colleagues and *literally* people on the street is the Dream Pairs Wonder Cloud Aphrodite Ruched Square Toe Kitten Heel Sandals. Impressively, they\u2019re less than $50 and truly feel like a dream.\nThe brand, much like LifeStride, is well-known for its affinity to plush comfort at accessible price points. This wins the award for best nude heels because they\u2019re the ones I typically reach for that work with a variety of outfits. Even better, they\u2019re great for driving, commuting and partying alike.\nI love wearing these shoes to weddings where I\u2019ll dance the night away as I find they\u2019re the perfect nude heels. The strap around the ankles is incredibly comfortable and not restricting, and the thicker band by the toes makes them blister-proof. They\u2019re the ideal height and have plush material. Seriously, everyone *needs* these shoes.\nThe ankle strap allows them to feel even more secure when worn. Plus, the thick band near the toes prevents blisters and offers another layer of support.\nSize Range: US 6 to 11 | Color Options: 5 | Heel Height: 2.36 inches | Material: PU leather\nBest Budget: LifeStride Parigi Pumps\nPros:\n- Offered in a variety of colors (side note: you\u2019ll want to pick up everyone!)\n- Comfortable insole and equally as comfortable heel\nCons:\n- The rim of the heel will become scuffed over time with frequent use\nI\u2019m not going to lie, I\u2019ve had the LifeStride Parigi Pumps in my closet for a while. And, rightfully so, as they\u2019re comfortable and look like a stock image of what a high heel should be.\nAt only $50, this pair of heels may be one of your best values yet. I wore them on several extracurricular formal activities (job fairs, interviews, you know the drill) and they never let me down. In fact, I ran to DSW to pick up another pair because they\u2019re my most-worn pumps \u2014 and the most comfortable \u201ctrue pumps\u201d I own.\nSize Range: US 5 to 12 | Color Options: 20 | Heel Height: 2.5 inches | Material: Faux leather\nBest Splurge: INEZ Sara Heels\nPros:\n- Excellent for days of long walking\n- Trending brand, thanks to its durable construction and comfort\n- Supports the heel and arch well\nCons:\n- Price point may be unreachable for some\n- Heel height may be too tall for some wearers\nCommerce writer/reporter Emma Sutton-Williams recently had the chance to test out a pair of Inez 3.5-inch heels, which claim to be a comfortable option for women \u2014 a phrase you don\u2019t often hear. She has been tempted to try them for a while, too. \u201cI\u2019d seen the ads, heard a friend-of-a-friend rave about them and watched other women say they worked great. But who are these women? Do they normally wear heels? And do they have bunions like I do?\u201d Sutton-Williams shared.\nWell, she decided to try them out firsthand. Most women wear heels from the car to an event, but she took the Sara in black with 3.5-inch heels all around the Upper West Side. \u201cI was walking with two dudes who have no idea about the pressures or pace a woman faces while walking \u2014 and I\u2019m proud to say I outpaced them without any pain,\u201d Sutton-Williams shared.\nWas it blissful and cushioned like a Birkenstock? Not exactly. It\u2019s still a heel, but a very well-balanced one, with a cushion in the toe box that supported the frame of her foot the entire night. \u201cWe went out to dinner, and in New York, that means trying three different restaurants before finally settling in if you don\u2019t have a reservation,\u201d Sutton-Williams noted. \u201cI logged about two miles on my feet and felt like a supermodel. For the first time, I had the height I\u2019ve always wanted, with a solid structure that didn\u2019t make me wobble or feel unsupported.\u201d\nThere\u2019s an option for slim, regular and roomy. Sutton-Williams opted for regular, and they fit her size 9.5 foot just fine. \u201cAt first, I felt the need to curl my toes down a bit to make sure they didn\u2019t slip off \u2014 but they won\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cOnce I got used to wearing them, I relaxed my feet and strutted around the city with ease.\u201d\nThe consensus? They\u2019re worth the $268, per Sutton-Williams. \u201cIn fact, I liked them so much, I bought another pair with a 2.5-inch heel to wear at the office \u2014 and I\u2019ll pull out the super high ones for sexier moments or days when I want to tower above everyone. Trust me, it\u2019s really fun.\u201d\nOverall, you really do need to try these handcrafted shoes from Spain. They\u2019re beautifully made, and Sutton-Williams looks forward to wearing them for years to come.\nSize Range: US 5 to 10.5 | Color Options: 3 | Heel Height: 3.5 inches | Material: Luxe Italian Leather\nMost Comfortable Designer Heels: Vince Camuto Retsie Pumps\nPros:\n- Affordable, for the comfort and look\n- Polished, subtly retro design\n- Comfortable at the back of the heel\nCons:\n- Not entirely practical for everyday wear\nVince Camuto truly knows how to architect a heel, as evident with the designer\u2019s Hailenda Pump. I love its polished design, with its pointed toe, which is surprisingly comfortable for my subtly wide feet. Seriously, they look so good.\nI don\u2019t know why, but these heels make me feel like I\u2019m on the cast of \u201cPretty Little Liars\u201d (in other words, I feel like a chic Ally from Rosewood). They\u2019re available in a wealth of shades you\u2019ll want to snatch up and they slip on like a glove. While a bit taller than what I normally wear, they aren\u2019t restricting.\nBecause of their height, I anticipated that these shoes would be not-so-comfy. But after years of wearing them, I can say that these are a pair of black heels I love. While I only reach for them on special occasions, this is kind of my reminder to style them more \u2014 with jeans, maxi skirts and whatever else I find in my closet.\nSize Range: US 5 to 11 | Color Options: 3 | Heel Height: 3.25 inches | Material: Leather\nMost Comfortable Low Heels: Vice Versa The Publicist Pump\nPros:\n- Shoe converts from flats to heels\n- Well made with a sturdy structure to walk in without fear of the heel collapsing\n- Four shades to choose from\nCons:\n- Takes a little time to break in, so I suggest bringing some bandaids along just in case\n- There is a slight heel-to-toe rocking motion when in the flat position\nIf you\u2019re the gal who walks to work in flats and changes to heels upon arrival or behind a flower pot (guilty), these heels are for you. And perhaps the most intriguing shoe on the market today.\nThe Publicist Pump is a chic heel that converts to flats with the click of a button. It was designed in Los Angeles. It allows you to pop open the sole, where a button clicks the heel into place. When you\u2019re done, click the button, and it collapses back into a flat without anyone knowing the difference.\n\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s been a real game-changer running around the streets of Manhattan,\u201d Emma Sutton-Williams, commerce writer/reporter, shared. \u201cI enjoy a pop of red, but these shoes also come in black patent, black silk and gold patent.\u201d\nSize Range: US 5 to 12 | Color Options: 4 | Heel Height: 3.7 inches tall and 1.3 inches flat | Material: Leather or Silk\nMost Comfortable Heels for Work: VIVAIA Square-Toe Water Repellent Heeled Boots\nPros:\n- True-to-size fit\n- Comfortable, stretchy fabric that are great comfortable heels for work\n- Vast size range\nCons:\n- Seasonal shoes, so may not be the best pick for summer and hot climates\nFor a sublime pair of comfortable heels, turn heads with these chic-heeled booties. The VIVAIA Square-Toe Water Repellent Heeled Boots are offered in a vast shade range and are a beloved, trusty pair.\n\u201cMy regular size fits perfectly and the square toe leaves plenty of wiggle room,\u201d Erica Radol, Page Six commerce writer/reporter, shared, naming them the shoes she swears by for the office, specifically. \u201cThe upper is a comfy, secure, stretchy fabric, so these would likely fit a variety of foot widths. I have other pairs of Vivaia and found consistent sizing across styles (the Mary Jane flats are another favorite). I appreciate that the Regina Pro booties pull on, making them a cinch to take on and off.\u201d\nSince these booties comfortably work from the office to dinner plans, are water-repellent and breathable, and can be spot-cleaned, they justify the price tag of $150. They also have a herbal, antimicrobial insole that counters any potential odor. \u201cBased on use so far, I expect the pair to last a very long time,\u201d Radol added. \u201cThey garner compliments, too!\u201d\nEveryone from Oprah to Julia Roberts has been spotted in the brand. They\u2019re also made from recycled water bottles but you would never know it to look at them! \u201cI love that they are a vegan, planet-friendly and stylish pair all in one,\u201d Radol highlighted.\nRadol noted that her foot is very comfortable in them all day, especially compared to pointy-toe boots. \u201cThere is cushioning in the sole and the bottom is anti-slip, which makes them stable, even when walking the city streets,\u201d she reviewed.\nAs heels that \u201cfeel as comfortable as flats,\u201d per Radol, this VIVAIA pair is worth the buy.\nSize Range: US 5 to 11 | Color Options: 19 | Heel Height: 2.16 inches | Material: Water-repellent yarn\nMost Comfortable Kitten Heels: Wild Fable Sasha Buckle Slingback Kitten Heels\nPros:\n- Memory foam insole\n- Adjustable straps\n- No break-in necessary\n- Versatile style that can be dressed up or down\n- Budget-friendly price point\nCons:\n- Sellout risk\n- Patent leather is a bit noisy\nIf you\u2019re looking for the most comfortable heels for standing all day, the Wild Fable Sasha Buckle Slingback Kitten Heels are a no-brainer pair. After testing, it\u2019s why these are an excellent value: they look cute, are extremely comfortable and naturally versatile.\n\u201cListen, my feet are delicate and sensitive,\u201d Meaghan Roche, senior commerce SEO manager, shared. \u201cThey start blistering at the mere mention of a stiletto, a Doc Marten boot or (god-forbid) a penny loafer (yes, I\u2019m still traumatized by my Catholic school days). I\u2019ve had shoes that I could simply never break into because my feet would bleed every time I wore them. So, you could say out-of-the-box comfort is of high importance for me when I\u2019m shoe shopping.\u201d\nAll of that being said, Roche was in need of a cute pair of heels for her NYE outfit \u2014 on a budget and on a quick turnaround. Wild Fable did not disappoint with its low kitten heel, which served trendy and cute while earning bonus points for comfort.\n\u201cPointed toes can be hit or miss, but the toe bed is comfortable and designed with a good amount of space to prevent rubbing,\u201d Roche added. \u201cThe slingback straps have stretch, but stay in place and play nicely with tights.\u201d\nThe star of the shoe is the memory foam insole. \u201cI was really pleasantly surprised by this bonus feature, especially for the price point and this being a Target purchase,\u201d Roche said. \u201cThe memory foam offers a nice cushiony support that only improves over time.\u201d\nSize Range: US 6 to 11 | Color Options: 1 | Heel Height: 2.25 inches | Material: Shiny faux leather\nHow we tested\nSome of these shoes were worn for at least one month while others we\u2019ve owned for as long as six years and are tried-and-true staples on my shoe rack. Ahead, here\u2019s the testing criteria we kept in mind while waltzing around in each of them:\n- Comfort: This wouldn\u2019t be a comfortable heels roundup without placing comfort at the forefront of what we were looking for. Dialing it down to the basics, if any heel tested provided an ounce of discomfort, it didn\u2019t make the final cut.\n- Versatility: Of course, some heels are positioned to be worn for special occasions while others have a penchant for everyday wear. We kept this characteristic in mind while testing.\n- Value: The saying, \u201cYou get what you pay for\u201d is usually true, but there are some affordable options on this list that blow that expression out of the water. You can rest assured that every pair on this list is comfortable for all-day wear.\nThese shoes were worn to work, to weddings, to weekend brunches and everything in between. I know the struggle of ordering shoes online, so this is dedicated to everyone who wants an easy shopping experience.\nWhat are comfortable heels for standing all day?\nRegardless of your personal style, there are some key things to consider when selecting a shoe you\u2019re going to be standing all day in.\nHeels with a round or square toe, for example, may be preferable to those that are pointed. The reason for this is that they tend to be more breathable. No one wants to deal with sweaty, squished feet, right?\nHeel length is another thing to look at. Higher heels generally mean more pressure on calves, ankles and feet.\nWhat is the most comfortable heel height for work?\nThe most comfortable heel height is whatever you feel good standing for long periods in \u2014 obviously. However, as a rule of thumb, the shorter the height, the easier on your tootsies. According to our research, podiatrists tend to recommend forgoing anything above 3 inches when foot health is concerned. However, as we\u2019ve already discussed, this still leaves a lot of options.\nWhat brand make the most comfortable shoes?\nThere are a variety of brands that make high-quality, comfortable shoes that you can walk around all day in. Here are some we always look to when craving a new pair:\nThe other heel brands on our radar \u2014 and why\nIt\u2019s impossible for the Post Wanted team to try *every* single pair of comfy heels out there, especially as some are seasonal styles that go out of stock within only a few months.\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t mean our team of shopping pros didn\u2019t do our research. Here are the best ones that are on our radar that we haven\u2019t tested quite yet, and why:\n- Dolce Vita: Dolce Vita is known for blending fashion-forward design with thoughtful construction, using cushioned insoles and quality materials that prioritize all-day wearability. Its heels \u2014 like the Yella Heels ($150) \u2014 often feature manageable heel heights and supportive silhouettes, making them a reliable choice for stylish yet comfortable footwear.\n- Tory Burch: Tory Burch combines timeless, elegant design with well-crafted construction, often incorporating padded footbeds and ergonomic shapes for enhanced comfort. The brand uses premium materials and thoughtful detailing \u2014 like the Ines Heeled Sandal ($298) \u2014 making their heels both stylish and suitable for extended wear.\n- Vionic: Vionic is renowned for its podiatrist-designed footbeds that offer superior arch support, alignment and cushioning, making its heels exceptionally comfortable for prolonged wear. Its heels \u2014 like the Zinfandel Block Heel Sandal ($150) \u2014 seamlessly combine orthopedic technology with stylish designs, catering to those who prioritize foot health without sacrificing fashion.\n- Dansko: Dansko is a trusted brand for comfortable heels thanks to its focus on ergonomic design, featuring contoured footbeds, excellent arch support and shock-absorbing soles. Its durable construction and supportive fit \u2014 as seen in the Taytum Milled Nubuck Heels ($150) \u2014 make them ideal for people who are on their feet for long hours but still want a polished look.\n- Kate Spade: Kate Spade offers comfortable heels by blending chic, feminine design with thoughtful touches like padded insoles and well-balanced heel heights. The brand focuses on quality craftsmanship and materials, making its heels \u2014 like the Flourish Heeled Sandal ($268) \u2014 stylish enough for events while still offering decent comfort for extended wear.\n- Naturalizer: Naturalizer is known for designing heels specifically shaped to fit the contours of a woman\u2019s foot, offering features like cushioned insoles, arch support and breathable linings for all-day comfort. With a long-standing reputation for combining comfort and classic style, its heels are a reliable choice for both work and social settings.\n- Sam Edelman: Sam Edelman is a trusted brand for comfortable heels because it blends modern, trend-driven styles with padded footbeds and moderate heel heights that enhance wearability. The brand focuses on creating fashion-forward designs \u2014 like the 27 Edit Grace Dress Sandal ($130) \u2014 without compromising on comfort, making their heels a popular choice for both everyday and occasion wear.\n- Cole Haan: Cole Haan is praised for its innovative use of comfort technology, such as Grand.OS cushioning and lightweight construction, which makes its heels exceptionally wearable throughout the day. The brand combines sleek, professional design with performance-inspired comfort \u2014 like the Mylah Pumps ($90) \u2014 ideal for those who need both style and support in one shoe.\n- Sarah Flint: Sarah Flint is renowned for creating luxurious heels that prioritize comfort without compromising on style. Each pair is handcrafted in Italy using premium materials and features thoughtful design elements such as anatomical arch support, a wider toe box and 6mm of extra padding to ensure all-day wearability, as shown in with the Perfect Kitten Pump 50 ($450).\nWhy Trust Post Wanted by the New York Post\nFor over 200 years, the New York Post has been America\u2019s go-to source for bold news, engaging stories, in-depth reporting, and now, insightful shopping guidance.
