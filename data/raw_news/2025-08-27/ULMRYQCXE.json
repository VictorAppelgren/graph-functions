  "content": "National security analysts are reacting harshly to President Trump\u2019s announced plan to double the number of Chinese students allowed into the United States to 600,000.\n\nMr. Trump said amid ongoing trade talks with China that he wants to allow the 600,000 Chinese to attend American universities to help the schools financially.\n\n\u201cI hear so many stories that we\u2019re not going to allow their students,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re going to allow their students to come in. It\u2019s very important, 600,000 students. It\u2019s very important. But we\u2019re going to get along with China.\u201d\n\nAt a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday the president said he believes its \u201cvery insulting\u201d to say Chinese students are not welcome.\n\nWithout the foreign students \u201c\u201cour college system would go to hell very quickly. And it wouldn\u2019t be the top colleges, so it\u2019d be colleges that struggle on the bottom,\u201d Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe president said he told Chinese President Xi Jinping that the United States is \u201chonored to have their students here.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, with that, we check in with careful [monitoring] and we see who\u2019s there,\u201d he added.\n\nFormer State Department China policymaker Miles Yu said allowing Chinese students in the country poses a national security danger.\n\nDriven by a non-market economy controlled by the Chinese Communist Party that lacks constitutionally allowed property rights, the communist regime stifles free thought and academic autonomy and harbors an unrelenting ambition for global hegemony, he said.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Chinese students who attend American universities are vital for the CCP\u2019s goal of technological and military dominance.\n\nNearly 90% of the estimated 7 million Chinese students who studied abroad, mainly in the United States, return to serve the CCP and its machinery of control and aggression, Mr. Yu said.\n\n\u201cFor the United States, this is a dangerous and one-sided arrangement,\u201d said Mr. Yu, now director of the China Center at the Hudson Institute.\n\n\u201cAmerican universities invest resources to educate these Chinese students, who then take their skills and knowledge back to a regime that seeks to undermine U.S. global standing.\u201d\n\nMr. Yu said the United States must decisively curb China\u2019s access to American schools and end the CCP\u2019s unchecked exploitation of the higher education system for its authoritarian goals.\n\nChina expert Gordon Chang also said allowing 600,000 Chinese students in the country is a security threat.\n\n\u201cDo we need 600,000 potential Chinese spies in America,\u201d he said X. \u201cThat\u2019s in addition to all the actual ones here already.\u201d\n\nMr. Chang, with the Gatestone Institute, also questioned how the United States will educate the next generation of Americans when \u201cwe sell their university slots to China\u2019s future communists.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s plan for doubling Chinese student enrollment is a sharp reversal of an earlier policy targeting reductions in Chinese students in the United States.\n\nIn May, the State Department said it had begun aggressively revoking visas for an estimated 270,000 Chinese students over concerns they are stealing American technology.\n\nThe visa cancellations were targeted at students with connections to the CCP.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement announcing the action that visa scrutiny for Chinese are being revised and given enhanced scrutiny.\n\nThe action is in line with policies of putting \u201cAmerica first, not China,\u201d Mr. Rubio said.\n\nThe shift on Chinese students comes as Mr. Trump is seeking a summit meeting with Mr. Xi as early as this fall.\n\nEarlier this year, Mr. Trump reversed course on restricting exports of Nvidia microchips by allowing the major artificial intelligence firm to sell some of its advanced chips to China.\n\nU.S. security officials have said Chinese students and researchers are obtaining critical U.S. research, intellectual property and technology that will enhance the Chinese military.\n\nRep. John Moolenaar, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, said the student visa program had become \u201ca Trojan horse for Beijing\u201d that provides unrestricted access to top research institutions that poses \u201ca direct threat to our national security.\u201d\n\nA recent think tank report reveals that U.S.-based Chinese students are organized through student and scholar groups that are funded and controlled by Beijing.\n\n\u201cEvidence from U.S. government sources \u2014 including the State Department, FBI and congressional commissions \u2014 shows that many [Chinese Students and Scholars Associations] are closely linked to Chinese consulates and operate under guidance or financial support from Chinese diplomatic missions,\u201d the report by the CCP Biothreats Initiative stated.\n\nChina opposed the earlier plan to revoke student visas as unjustified. \u201cThis politically motivated and discriminatory move exposes the U.S. hypocrisy over freedom and openness,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said in May.\n\nThe State Department referred questions about the Chinese students to the White House. White House National Security Council spokesmen did not respond to email requests for comment.\n\nThe Space Force on Thursday conducted the latest launch into space of the X-37B space plane, known formally as the orbital test vehicle.\n\nThe launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida was the eighth mission for the space plane that analysts say may serve as a future platform for the Space Force\u2019s so far non-public counterspace weapons.\n\nThe Space Force said in a statement that the plane will conduct a variety of tests and experiments during its mission.\n\n\u201cThese operational demonstrations and experiments comprise of next-generation technologies including laser communications and the highest performing quantum inertial sensor ever tested in space,\u201d the statement said.\n\nThe mission will conduct laser communications demonstrations involving proliferated commercial satellite networks in low earth orbit, the Space Force said.\n\nAlthough Space Force did not say so, space lasers can also be used to attack satellites.\n\nSpace-based lasers also could be part of President Trump\u2019s plan for a national missile defense dubbed Golden Dome for America.\n\nLasers are regarded by experts as a key antidote to China\u2019s high speed hypersonic missiles.\n\nThe latest X-37B mission\u2019s \u201claser communications demonstration will mark an important step in the U.S. Space Force\u2019s ability to leverage proliferated space networks as part of a diversified and redundant space architectures,\u201d said Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman.\n\nChina obtained information on the X-37 in the early 2000s from Greg Chung Dongfang, a Boeing engineer who was convicted of spying for Beijing. Court papers in the Chung case revealed that Chung held internal Boeing documents at his home, including a report labeled \u201cBoeing proprietary\u201d called \u201cX-37 space plane overview.\u201d\n\nIn 2010, Chung was convicted of economic espionage and acting as an unregistered agent for China and sentenced to 15 years in prison.\n\nChina launched its first space plane that appears similar in shape to the X-37 in 2020, likely with the help of stolen U.S. technology.\n\nA Chinese technical journal, Winged Missiles Journal, stated in a 2014 article that the X-37B \u201cpossesses robust space warfare capabilities, enabling it to execute diverse attack missions against low-orbit targets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe X-37B can serve as an anti-satellite platform carrying hard and soft kill weapons such as laser weapons, microwave weapons, kinetic weapons, contaminants, and net-deploying systems,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe plane can rapidly maneuver near space targets and employ onboard weapons for attack, using a robotic arm, directed energy strikes or kinetic attacks, the article said.\n\nChina to reveal new weapons at upcoming parade\n\nU.S. and allied intelligence agencies are set to closely monitor an upcoming military parade in Beijing where China\u2019s military is expected to show off new weapons.\n\nChinese state media already has previewed some of the new weapon systems that were revealed during parade rehearsals for next month\u2019s 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.\n\nAlong with goose-stepping troops, the People\u2019s Liberation Army will show off new YJ-series hypersonic anti-ship missiles, and a new, more lethal version of its DF-26 intermediate-range missile that the Chinese have dubbed the \u201cGuam Killer\u201d for its ability to hit the major U.S. military hub in the western Pacific.\n\nNew YJ-17, YJ-19 and YJ-20 missiles were shown in one rehearsal for the Sept. 3 parade.\n\nAnother weapon previewed by state media is a new variant of a road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile.\n\nSubmarine warfare weapons will include two new extra-large unmanned underwater vehicles identified in photos as the AJX002 and a larger one hidden under a tarp. The AJX002 appears similar to Russia\u2019s Poseidon nuclear-tipped torpedo.\n\nNew tanks, armored vehicles, artillery guns, advanced radar and a laser weapon also are expected to be unveiled.\n\nChina\u2019s large arsenal of aerial drones is also likely to be featured in the parade.\n\nA Chinese military spokesman told reporters all weaponry in the parade will be domestically produced and in service. The arms reflect the PLA\u2019s ability to \u201cadapt to technological developments and evolution of warfare forms, and to win future wars,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nBoth Japan and Taiwan have called for regional states to shun the parade, noting that Chinese Communist Party forces did little or no fighting during World War II.\n\nMost of the war against Japan was carried out by the Chinese Nationalist forces.\n\nBeijing calls the war \u201cthe Chinese People\u2019s War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War.\u201d",
