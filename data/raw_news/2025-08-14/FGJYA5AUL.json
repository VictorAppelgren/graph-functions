  "title": "I test game controllers for a living, and these are my absolute favorites I've reviewed in 2025 so far",
  "description": "The year\u2019s best gamepads",
  "content": "There are so many companies making game controllers these days, it can be enough to make one\u2019s head spin. Especially if you\u2019re looking to branch out from first-party gear and peek at the wider scope of products offered by brands like Victrix, 8BitDo, Nacon, and the like.\n\nWhile we have dedicated lists for the best PS5 controllers, best Xbox controllers, best PC controllers, and more, 2025 has seen a variety of excellent new gamepads hit the market. As such, I\u2019ve created a handy list of my favorite controllers that I\u2019ve personally tested and reviewed this year.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have the time to browse through our individual guides and reviews, I hope this list will provide convenient reading for the five controllers you should have your eye on this year - whether you\u2019re in the market for a new mainstay or a spare for friends and family.\n\nI\u2019ll start the list with my favorite first-party controller of the year, none other than the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller. Is it the most groundbreaking or visually striking controller of the year? No, certainly not. But Nintendo has made some smart tweaks to its Pro Controller that had me loving it as soon as it was in my hands.\n\nBuild quality is simply fantastic, with some of the smoothest-feeling thumbsticks to come from a first-party manufacturer. Plus, the addition of a pair of remappable buttons on the rear might not be anything new, but they\u2019re extremely welcome on the Switch 2 Pro Controller, and being able to quickly assign them via a quick menu (and on a per-game basis) is a blessing.\n\nI, of course, also have to mention the seemingly bottomless battery life of this gamepad. At around 40-50 hours, it outclasses PlayStation\u2019s DualSense wireless controller practically tenfold. It\u2019s a superb upgrade over the Joy-Con 2 controllers, too, and I think it\u2019s an essential purchase for playing the best Nintendo Switch 2 games with.\n\u2022 Compatible with PS5, Xbox, and PC (PS5 and Xbox versions will be sold separately)\n\nThe Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded is an upgraded version of the original Pro BFG, and currently the best premium PS5 controller I\u2019ve ever tested (though an Xbox version is also on the way). While currently up for pre-order at Turtle Beach\u2019s website and due for a release in late September, I\u2019ve been able to go hands-on and have tested it for review.\n\nThe original Pro BFG was already a great controller, thanks to its innovative swappable pad modules that allow for a ton of customizability. It\u2019s the same here on the Reloaded model, letting players opt for symmetrical or asymmetrical stick layouts (as well as southpaw layouts) depending on their preference. The revised Fightpad module is also wonderful, and a great option for players of the best fighting games.\n\nChiefly, the Reloaded brings Hall effect thumbsticks to the Pro BFG model, which will allow for a much longer-lasting controller. I\u2019m glad this is an upgrade Victrix has chosen for the pad. After all, at $209.99 / \u00a3179.99, you\u2019ll most definitely want the pad to last for a good few years without needing to worry about stick drift.\n\u2022 Compatible with Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC (Xbox and Switch versions sold separately)\n\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate 2 is an excellent upgrade over the original Ultimate controller. That first model is still my favorite Nintendo Switch controller, and the Ultimate 2 - which has versions available for Xbox and Switch systems - has some notable advantages over its predecessor.\n\nThe Ultimate 2 employs sublimely smooth TMR (tunnelling magnetoresistance) thumbsticks. In layman\u2019s terms, that\u2019s an improved version of Hall effect with even greater longevity. Other additions, including two extra remappable bumpers and digital trigger locks, are, of course, very welcome, too.\n\nSome elements of the Ultimate 2 I could take or leave, though. The new RGB ring lighting around the thumbsticks looks gorgeous and is impressively customizable. However, they do have a bit more drain on overall battery life when used wirelessly. But still, that\u2019s a small (and expected) blemish on an otherwise brilliant 8BitDo pad.\n\nI loved Nacon\u2019s Revolution 5 Pro controller for PS5, but the Revolution X Unlimited is basically that, but better. While only compatible with Xbox consoles and PC, it\u2019s a notably upgraded gamepad in several ways.\n\nThe unique selling point of the Revolution X Unlimited is its built-in LCD display. Usually, I\u2019m not a great fan of these; like with the Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot, they can be cumbersome and not add a whole lot to the overall play experience.\n\nNacon has thankfully trimmed the fat here. A single dedicated button is all it takes to switch to the screen\u2019s navigation, and its menu keeps things simple, offering options for headset and mic audio tuning, quick button mapping, and wireless pairing options. It offers exactly as much as it needs to without any needless bloat.\n\nFinally, we have the Horipad Turbo, a budget Nintendo Switch controller option from manufacturer Hori. It\u2019s not a gamepad that absolutely blew my socks off, but I was impressed with it as a low-cost option.\n\nFor starters, its built-in Turbo button is a good fit for the games in Nintendo Switch Online\u2019s retro libraries. This saves you from having to press a single button over and over again, and you can instead hold it down for as many inputs as you need.\n\nWhile its budget nature shows with lightweight, plasticky build quality and the lack of wireless, gyro, or vibration support, it\u2019s otherwise a no-nonsense gamepad that\u2019s perfect as a spare for local multiplayer gaming. There are a few officially licensed Nintendo-themed designs to choose from, too, and they all look rather lovely.\n\nYou might also like...\n\u2022 Think you know your sweet rolls from your goopy carbonara?

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate 2 has some nice improvements over its predecessor. Namely, the addition of two remappable shoulder buttons, trigger locks, and an upgrade from Hall effect to even more resilient TMR thumbsticks. RGB lighting around the thumbsticks is a nice touch, too, but I\u2019d recommend keeping them off if you\u2019re playing wirelessly, as they\u2019re a pretty huge drain on battery life.\nPros\n- +\nSublime TMR thumbsticks\n- +\nThe two extra remappable bumpers are welcome additions\n- +\nAs are the digital trigger locks\n- +\nCharging dock included\n- +\nRGB rings are a nice touch, but\u2026\nCons\n- -\n\u2026said RGB rings are a real battery drain\n- -\nBattery life in general is worse than the original\n- -\nSwitch-compatible version sold separately\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\n8BitDo Ultimate 2: one-minute review\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate 2 gaming controller is a pretty straightforward upgrade over the original 8BitDo Ultimate - a pad that continues to feature in our list of the best Nintendo Switch controllers. And while the Ultimate 2 is yet to receive its own Switch-compatible model (it\u2019s just PC and Android for now, sadly), it remains a very competent gamepad that brings several welcome improvements.\nChiefly, the Ultimate 2 now features TMR (tunnelling magnetoresistance, for those curious) thumbsticks. We\u2019ve seen this tech implemented in other fantastic PC controllers such as the GameSir Tarantula Pro, and they\u2019re just as welcome here, offering greater stability and longevity than even Hall effect sticks.\nThe controller also adds two extra shoulder buttons, making for a total of four remappable buttons (the other two are found on the rear of the pad, like before). You\u2019ll also find a pair of trigger locks back there, letting you quickly swap between analog and digital trigger presses based on your preference.\nThe last major addition here is RGB lighting rings around each thumbstick. These look nice and can be customized via the 8BitDo Ultimate Software PC companion app. But if you\u2019re playing wirelessly, I would advise against keeping them on, as they\u2019re a pretty major drain on the gamepad\u2019s already average battery life.\n8BitDo Ultimate 2 review: price and availability\n- $59.99 / \u00a349.99 (around AU$90)\n- Cheaper than the 8BitDo Ultimate at retail price\n- Available via Amazon\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate 2 controller is available to buy now from the brand\u2019s Amazon store. It costs $59.99 / \u00a349.99 (around AU$90), which is actually $10 / \u00a310 cheaper than its predecessor. As a result, I can confidently say that if you\u2019re shopping for a new PC controller in the 8BitDo line up, this is the one to go for. You\u2019re saving cash and getting more features to boot.\n8BitDo Ultimate 2 review: Specs\nPrice | $59.99 / \u00a349.99 (around AU$90) |\nWeight | 8.7oz / 246g |\nDimensions | 5.7 x 4.1 x 2.4in / 147 x 103 x 61mm |\nCompatibility | PC, Android |\nConnection type | Wireless (2.4GHz, Bluetooth), Wired (USB-C) |\nBattery life | 10-15 hours |\n8BitDo Ultimate 2 review: design and features\n- Eye-catching RGB lighting\n- Additional remappable buttons\n- Supports 2.4GHz and Bluetooth wireless connections\nAs I\u2019ve come to expect from the brand, the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 boasts excellent build quality. It feels exceptionally sturdy in the hands, with lightly textured grips allowing the pad to rest firmly.\nThe TMR thumbsticks now feature metallic shafts, a pleasant upgrade over the original model that not only looks smart but should help the sticks in the longevity department, too. Otherwise, the d-pad, face buttons, and central utility buttons (including Start, Select, Home, etc.) all feel similar to the first Ultimate. That means you can expect very solid materials overall. One nice change is that those central buttons are spaced out much better here than on the Ultimate, where they felt a little cramped together on that pad.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAs mentioned above, you\u2019re also getting four remappable buttons, two on the rear, and two nestled up next to the bumpers and triggers. These are labeled \u2018L4\u2019 and \u2018R4\u2019 on the left and right, respectively, while the rear paddles are labeled as \u2018PL\u2019 and \u2018PR\u2019. The rear also houses two trigger locks for switching between analog and digital trigger distances, as well as a toggle for swapping between Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless connections.\nIf you\u2019re curious as to where the included 2.4GHz dongle is located (it took me a moment to realize this at first), it\u2019s housed within the charging dock that the controller also comes with. Simply flip open the hatch on the bottom and you\u2019ll find it tucked inside. One thing to note here is that the dongle requires a USB-C port for connection, unlike the original Ultimate controller. That\u2019s naturally great for Android devices, but you may want to invest in a USB-C to USB adapter if your gaming PC or laptop lacks the necessary USB-C port.\n8BitDo Ultimate 2 review: Performance\n- Sublime drift-resistant TMR thumbsticks\n- Battery life is hurt compared to the original Ultimate\n- Satisfyingly tactile buttons and triggers\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate 2 has been my go-to controller for the past couple of weeks - and not just for testing purposes. The controller simply feels fantastic during play, largely owing to the buttery smooth TMR thumbsticks and the highly tactile shoulder and face buttons.\nHaving tested the controller with titles like Lies of P, Elden Ring Nightreign, Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time, Tekken 8, and Final Fantasy 14 Online, I find that the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 is well-suited to a broad variety of genres and gaming styles.\nOne slight dampener, though, is the inclusion of those RGB rings around the thumbsticks. Don\u2019t get me wrong, they look lovely in action, and produce a very pleasing moving light based on the direction you\u2019re pointing the sticks (and respond to button presses, too). It\u2019s snazzy, but the toll it takes on battery life makes them not really worth enabling during wireless play.\nI was quite surprised at first when the batteries emptied from full in around 10 hours, with those RGB lights enabled. However, when I played wirelessly with them switched off, I managed to squeeze a more fulsome 15 hours before needing to charge. That\u2019s still not quite class-leading, but by no means terrible. However, given I managed around 20 hours out of the original Ultimate, it\u2019s certainly a downgrade overall.\nLastly, a word on the Ultimate V2 Software app for PC. It\u2019s not much of a looker with a very basic user interface, but it does offer robust customization. Downloadable from 8BitDo\u2019s website, it lets you create up to three individual profiles, which you can swap between via a button press on the gamepad.\nYou can fully remap every button - including the extra rear and bumper buttons - as well as set button macros, stick and trigger sensitivity, vibration strength, and more. It\u2019s all accompanied by handy diagrams which show you in real time how your changes affect the controller\u2019s performance.\nShould I buy the 8BitDo Ultimate 2?\nBuy it if...\nYou want an affordable PC or mobile controller that offers top-notch quality and performance\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate 2 barely puts a foot wrong. I have some qualms with the RGB lighting and its effect on battery life, but this is a phenomenal upgrade to an already world-class controller.\nYou enjoy in-depth controller customization\nThe Ultimate Software V2 app gives you the tools you need to customize pretty much every aspect of your play experience. From sensitivity and vibration strength to full button remapping, it\u2019s got it all and is especially perfect for competitive players who like specific control schemes.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou\u2019re not a PC gamer\nUnfortunately, the Ultimate 2 is not compatible with consoles like Nintendo Switch or Xbox Series X|S. For that, you\u2019ll need the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller, which is also available at the brand\u2019s website.\nYou want more battery life\nThe Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, this ain\u2019t. If this controller\u2019s short battery lifespan of around 10-15 hours has you feeling queasy, you may want to consider alternatives like the Xbox Wireless Controller (around 20-30 hours) or the aforementioned Switch Pro Controller (40+ hours), which is also compatible with PC.\n8BitDo Ultimate 2 review: Also consider\nThere\u2019s every chance the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 isn\u2019t quite what you\u2019re after. If so, consider these two similarly priced alternatives.\n| Row 0 - Cell 0 | 8BitDo Ultimate 2 | GameSir Tarantula Pro | 8BitDo Ultimate |\nPrice | $59.99 / \u00a349.99 (around AU$90) | $69.99 / \u00a369.99 (around AU$107) | $69.99 / \u00a359.99 (around AU$107) |\nWeight | 8.7oz / 246g | 11.5oz / 325g | 8.7oz / 245g |\nDimensions | 5.7 x 4.1 x 2.4in / 147 x 103 x 61mm | 6.2 x 3.9 x 2.4in / 157 x 99 x 61mm | 5.7 x 4.2 x 2.5in / 147 x 104 x 62mm |\nCompatibility | PC, Android | PC, Nintendo Switch, Android, iOS | PC, Nintendo Switch |\nConnection type | Wireless (2.4GHz, Bluetooth), Wired (USB-C) | Wireless (2.4GHz, Bluetooth), Wired (USB-C) | Wireless (2.4GHz, Bluetooth), Wired (USB-C) |\nBattery life | 10-15 hours | Around 12 hours | 15-20 hours |\nGameSir Tarantula Pro\nArguably the brand\u2019s best controller, and that\u2019s high praise given its usually high-quality output. This is a symmetrical controller with excellent build quality and a handy button layout switching feature that swaps the face buttons between XInput and Switch displays.\nRead our full GameSir Tarantula Pro review\n8BitDo Ultimate\nThe original 8BitDo Ultimate is still one of the best controllers ever made. It\u2019s a touch pricier, but you are getting Nintendo Switch compatibility and a better 20-hour battery life for your trouble. It\u2019s a bit slighter on features than the Ultimate 2, but still a worthwhile consideration.\nRead our full 8BitDo Ultimate review\nHow I tested the 8BitDo Ultimate 2\n- Tested for two weeks\n- Played a large variety of games across various genres\n- Compared directly to the original 8BitDo Ultimate\nI tested the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 across a period of two weeks, mainly on my gaming PC. I played titles from a variety of genres, including action games like Lies of P and Elden Ring Nightreign, as well as some of the best fighting games, such as Tekken 8 and Street Fighter 6.\nI primarily played wirelessly to gauge overall battery life, and made use of either wired play or the included charging dock when it was time to top up (which was fairly frequent given its slightly shorter battery life compared to its older sibling, the 8BitDo Ultimate).\nFirst reviewed June 2025\nRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for over four years.

      "text": "The best PS4 controllers in 2025: our favorites from Sony, Victrix and more\nAll the best PS4 controllers available today\nThe best PS4 controllers are able to provide extra functionality on the console for those looking for an enhanced play experience. Sony's previous-generation system might be well over a decade old (yep, we feel old too), but the upside here is that third-party controllers are becoming more affordable and plentiful. Even many of the best PS5 controllers and best PS5 racing wheels are compatible with PS4.\nDespite the PS4's relative age, it still has a massive install base to this day and support from developers is ongoing. While the system's pack-in DualShock 4 controller is arguably one of Sony's best ever, the console is also compatible with many of the best PC controllers. That's a great thing for those wanting features like trigger stops, extra programmable buttons, and other Pro-level functionality. Read on, then, to learn all about our picks for the best PS4 controllers you can buy today.\nThe quick list\nBest overall\nThe best overall PS4 controller\nSony's official PS4 pad impresses with ergonomic grip, an innovative touchpad and quality-of-life features such as the Share and Home buttons.\nBest premium\nThe best premium PS4 controller\nNacon's premium Revolution pad works as excellently on PS4 as it does the current generation of consoles.\nBest modular\nThe best modular PS4 controller\nFully compatible with the PS4, the Victrix Pro BFG is our go to choice if you want the customizability of a modular design.\nPros\n- Modular design\n- Excellent build quality\n- Highly customizable\nCons\n- Premium price tag\n- Lacks DualSense features\nBest for Xbox converts\nThe best PS4 controller for Xbox converts\nComing over from Xbox, but not a fan of the DualShock's symmetrical sticks? Nacon's fantastic asymmetrical pad was designed with you in mind.\nBest for kids\nThe best PS4 controller for kids\nIf you've got a little one or two running around, then the Hori Mini is perfectly suited for smaller hands.\nBest PS4 controllers in 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe best PS4 controller overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a high-quality, official gamepad: The DualShock 4 isn't exactly premium, but does everything you'd want from a pack-in controller.\n\u274c You want extra battery life: Lasting no longer than 8-10 hours on a full charge, the DualShock 4's battery life is quite poor.\nIt shouldn't be a surprise that Sony's official DualShock 4 tops our list of the best PS4 controllers. The DualShock 4 is one of Sony's best controllers to date. It's sleeker and more ergonomic than its previous pads. And on top of that, excellent features like the touchpad, lighting, and built-in speakers give the controller a lovely premium touch.\nThe DualShock 4 is pretty middle-of-the-road in terms of price. In 2025, expect to pay around $59.99 / \u00a354.99 for a brand new PS4 controller. While that does sound a touch pricey for a decade-old pad, it's one of the most reliable PS4 controllers around, and has some top-notch features you won't find on competing units.\nThose include the brilliant touchpad - great for ancillary inputs and navigation - as well as the convenient share button and those gorgeous, reactive side lights. The one area where the DualShock 4 is let down, though, much like the PS5's DualSense wireless controller, is in its pretty meager battery life.\n- Read more: DualShock 4 controller review\nThe best premium PS4 controller\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want an 'as good as it gets' PS4 controller: Nacon's latest controller builds upon its history to provide a truly premium controller for both PS5 and PS4 with plenty of additional features.\n\u274c You want something cheaper: As one of the pricier PS4 controllers around, Nacon's premium offering may turn the budget-conscious among you elsewhere.\nNacon's back at it again with another superb premium controller that's excellent on both PS4 and the current-gen PS5. Sporting superb build quality and excellent features, it's a highly customizable gamepad that's well worth the price of admission.\nDeveloped in tandem with Nathan 'Mister Crimson' Massol, a professional Street Fighter 6 player, the Revolution 5 Pro was created with high-end play and online multiplayer in mind. To that end, expect fantastic build quality and a range of ancillary features you won't find on other gamepads.\nThe full premium works are here, from a set of remappable back buttons and trigger stops to on-board mic control and profile switching. A customizable LED that circles around the right analog stick is a lovely extra touch, too. And if you're going wireless, there's even battery indicator LEDs situated just under the touchpad.\n- Read more: Nacon Revolution 5 Pro controller review\nThe best modular PS4 controller\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want unparalleled customization: The modular design of the Victrix Pro BFG gives you a level of customization that you simply won't find on other PS4 controllers.\n\u274c You don't want to break the bank: The Victrix Pro BFG is a modern controller bursting with high-end features, meaning that it comes at a pretty premium price.\nThe Victrix Pro BFG is easily the most versatile PS4 controller on this list thanks to its unique modular design. Almost everything about the controller can be tweaked, swapping out the buttons and thumbsticks for various alternate modules. This includes a tactile fighting game pad, which is perfect for those eager to dive into the likes of Street Fighter 6. The positions of each module can also be tweaked to your liking, including the option to play using an asymmetrical layout.\nAside from the modularity, we also appreciate the eye-catching design that blends more traditional black plastic with purple highlights. Considering its features, the controller is surprisingly lightweight too which helps keep it comfortable in the hands throughout lengthy gaming sessions.\nAlthough this controller was made primarily for the more recent PS5, it is fully compatible with the PS4. It can also be used with a PC, giving it plenty of versatility. Such a varied set of features does mean that the Victrix Pro BFG costs more than most, however, and you can currently get your hands on it for $179.99 / \u00a3179.99 / AU$269.\n- Read more: Victrix Pro BFG review\nThe best PS4 controller for Xbox converts\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You prefer an asymmetrical stick layout: Nacon's asymmetrical controller is a fantastic fit for players used to Xbox's controller layout.\n\u274c You're more used to symmetrical sticks: If you're primarily a PlayStation gamer, those asymmetrical analog sticks may prove irksome.\nNacon's at it again with the Asymmetric Wireless Controller. A comfortable gamepad that brings the Xbox One controller experience to PS4 (and PC) players. It's robust and well-made, with a chunkier design than the DualShock 4, which makes it more comfortable to hold across longer gaming sessions.\nAt \u00a349.99 (around $59.99) the controller's price is just about on par with the DualShock 4, meaning you won't be spending an arm and a leg for an alternative stick setup. However, its availability is spotty in the US, meaning those of you buying there may have better luck with other third-party controllers.\nIts name clues you in on the USP: the Nacon Asymmetric Wireless Controller has offset analog sticks, just like Xbox's controllers. We found this to be a better choice for those who have dexterity issues or those who simply prefer the offset design as opposed to Sony's tradition of applying symmetrical sticks to its official pads. However, there are a few performance issues to take into account.\nWe noticed some grating lag during testing, and there are no motion-sensing features. The light bar and speaker are missing, too, an important feature for some games. It's a good choice if you want a second pad to use for some specific dual-stick titles, but it likely won't replace your DualShock 4 unless you greatly prefer the asymmetry of its analog sticks.\n- Read more: Nacon Asymmetric Wireless Controller review\nThe best PS4 controller for kids\n5. Hori Mini Wired Gamepad\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You need spare pads for the kids: If you have particularly young children in your household, Hori's pad is perfect for smaller hands.\n\u274c You're not a child: It's hard to recommend this controller to adults, unless you really like the petite form factor.\nThe Hori Mini Wired Gamepad is a good fit for smaller hands. Whether you find regular PS4 gamepads too big or want an option for your kids, this controller will do the trick nicely. The Hori Mini Wired has a pleasingly retro look and feel. The wired pad has a 10ft cable and it\u2019s roughly 40 percent smaller than the DualShock 4. The grip is minimal as a result but makes it great for portability. It's also well suited to simple arcade titles.\nAt $29.99 / \u00a328.99, it's an affordable option if you need a cheap and cheerful controller for a child, making it an ideal gift for the youngsters in your family.\nBecause this PS4 pad is so small, though, you're lacking a light bar, stereo headset jack, speaker, dual motors, and a motion sensor. Think of it as a streamlined alternative to the DualShock 4. As such, a few games won't work with this controller, but more arcade-like titles or fighting games could benefit from its use.\nBest PS4 controller - FAQs\nIs the DualShock 4 the best PS4 Controller?\nAlthough the DualShock 4 is one of the best controllers available for the console, that doesn't mean it's the only high-quality controller worth having in your setup. There are a number of notable companies creating products for the console so whatever budget you're working with you're guaranteed a decent product outside of exclusively the DualShock.\nCan you connect a PS4 controller to a PS5?\nThe DualShock 4 controller will connect to a PS5, but you'll be limited to playing PS4 games exclusively. Since the DualSense controller for the PS5 offers new features that the DualShock lacks, you'll need to use the accompanying accessory to enjoy games on the PS5. As for third-party PS4 controllers, you won't be able to connect them to the PS5.\nCan I use the DualSense on PS4?\nUnfortunately not. The PS5's DualSense controller is not compatible with the last-gen console. That is a shame, given its improvements over the DualShock 4. But it's also understandable when considering the DualSense's haptic feedback won't be compatible with PS4 titles.\nAre third-party PS4 controllers worth it?\nIf you're operating with a smaller budget when shopping for PS4 accessories, third-party alternatives are always cheaper than official offerings, and that doesn't mean they are any lower quality than your standard DualShock. There's a lot to love about third-party controllers, especially since there's more space to tailor your product to any preferences you might have in a gamepad, making them worth considering whenever you're shopping.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for over four years. Particularly passionate about high-quality third-party controllers and headsets, Rhys strives to provide easy-to-read, informative coverage on gaming hardware of all kinds. As for the games themselves, Rhys is especially keen on fighting and racing games, as well as soulslikes and RPGs.\n- Kara PhillipsEvergreen Writer\n- Aleksha McLoughlinContributor\n- Dashiell WoodHardware Writer"

      "text": "The 15 best Nintendo Switch 2 games to play in 2025\nThese are the best Nintendo Switch 2 games to play on the new console\nThe best Nintendo Switch 2 games include platform exclusives that launched alongside Nintendo's new console, as well as older games that are now enhanced on the upgraded hardware. Even though the Switch 2 is still early in its lifecycle, there's a great list of games to check out, whether that's in docked or handheld mode.\nSince the release of Nintendo Switch 2, I've spent countless hours playing the games that make up its already impressive catalogue, and we've been hard at work reviewing as many games for the console as we can. Switch 2 exclusives like Mario Kart World have stood out, thanks to 4K visuals and great use of the extra horsepower that the Switch 2 provides. Still, there are plenty of the best Nintendo Switch games that make this list as well. These range from upgraded versions like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch Edition, to modern classics like Hollow Knight.\nLooking ahead, there are loads of upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 games to look forward to. As I get my hands on them, I'll be regularly updating this list, tweaking my recommendations for the very best games to play on Switch 2 as the year goes on. For now, here are the best games to play on Nintendo Switch 2 right away.\nBest Nintendo Switch 2 games 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army serves as a faithful, yet significantly refined take on its source material. It stays close to its PS2 roots visually, while adding much-needed quality of life improvements like a fresh UI and enhanced 3D environments. Expressive voice acting and a fantastic array of demons also add color to an engaging, mysterious plot.\" - Harry Padoan, TechRadar Reviews Staff Writer.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: faster loading times, more consistent 60FPS, better visuals when docked.\nRaidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army remasters one of Atlus' most under-appreciated gems, on that certain PS2 fans will remember fondly. For this new version, there's revamped visuals, QOL updates, new VO, and an overhauled battle system. All of these small updates help modernize the experience, and will no doubt help a whole new generation of gamers give it a try.\nIn Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army, you play as Raidou Kuzunoha XIV, an apprentice detective at the Narumi Detective Agency. The game is set in 1930s Tokyo, and features 120 Demons that can be summoned in battle. Many of these Demons are familiar, given that they've appeared in Persona games, and other Shin Megami Tensei projects. All in all, this is a great remaster of a unique and bold Atlus RPG. Fans of the studio will no doubt find plenty to love here, especially if playing it for the first time.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"Even with no prior experience of the Rune Factory series, Guardians of Azuma is a relaxing blend of genres that works in part due to the wholesome nature of its cast and setting. It\u2019s chicken soup on a rainy day - uncomplicated, but unmistakably enjoyable.\" - Lloyd Coombes, TechRadar Gaming reviewer.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: faster loading times, 60FPS, better visuals when docked.\nRune Factory: Guardians of Azuma arrived at the perfect time, just a few weeks after the launch of Switch 2, and in-between two big releases. Downtime like that can be a great time for games like Rune Factory to wow players, and that's exactly what the latest entry does. Part village-building simulator, part hack and slash, Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma offers up a seriously addictive combination, one that'll win the hearts of anyone fond of farming simulators.\nIn Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, you'll slowly build out a small village, get to know its quirky inhabitants, and even fall in love. There's a dozen characters to romance, allies that can be brought out with you on monster-hunting excursions, and plenty of upgrades that can be applied to your village. It's this upgrade loop that makes the game particularly more-ish, getting increasingly elaborate as you move from village to village building out your bases.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"Split Fiction offers the same thrilling fun on Switch 2 as on other platforms, but don't expect the same level of polish here. While Tabletop mode, in theory, offers the opportunity to take your co-op playthrough on the go, it's not the most optimal experience, and you'll likely find playing in TV mode more enjoyable. Overall, this is a pretty solid Switch 2 port, with some annoying niggles, but I advise picking up this co-adventure on another platform for the best experience all-round.\" - Vic Hood, TechRadar Gaming reviewer.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: GameShare, GameChat.\nSplit Fiction is the best co-op game you can load up on Switch 2, and thanks to the new GameShare feature, Switch 1 players can even join in for the first time. The ability to play the game handheld and to use the GameShare feature positions Split Fiction in quite a unique space when compared to other platforms. The performance isn't as good as on PC or PS5, but being able to take the game on the go and share the experience with those on older platforms more than makes up for any technical shortcomings.\nWe found Split Fiction to be an exhilarating co-op title in our PS5 playthrough, earning it a perfect score in our Split Fiction review. On Switch 2, we found it to measure up in the fun and gameplay variety, but did find a slight hit in technical performance. It's Hazelight's best game yet, and that's saying something, managing to improve upon its predecessors in combat, storytelling, and imagination. Thanks to Friend's Pass, you can invite a friend to play alongside you for free. It's neat features like this that pair so well with Nintendo Switch 2's GameChat and overall party-play ethos. It's a match made in heaven, one that's easy to recommend for those wanting to play with pals.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"It took a while for Street Fighter 6 to arrive, and for good reason. The final product is slickly polished, packed with modes and headlined by its feature-rich online Battle Hub and ambitious single player World Tour. It\u2019s a fighting game for everyone, with multiple control styles and vast accessibility options.\" - Rhys Wood, TechRadar Gaming Hardware Editor.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: Gyro Battle Mode, improved framerate, improved visuals, Calorie Contest Mode, and New amiibo functionality.\nStreet Fighter 6 was a real mixed bag on Switch, but its Switch 2 version fixes many of the issues we had. Firstly, the Switch 2 Pro Controller is a much better fit for the intricate inputs required for some Street Fighter 6 characters, with a hugely improved d-pad and back buttons that can be customized to suit your preferred configuration. Now, all but the World Tour Mode runs at 60FPS (frames per second), a huge step up that makes a world of difference in a fighting game such as this.\nWe absolutely adored Street Fighter 6 at launch, and it's only gotten better with post-launch additions like M. Bison, Terry, Mai, and Elena. Being able to take such a solid fighting game on the go is a real treat. You can challenge friends and use the improved tabletop mode to set up a match anywhere you want. There are some fun additional modes as well, that make very fun use of the Joy-Con's, though they're hardly the main event. With Year 3 content imminent, now is the perfect time to try out one of the best fighting games of all time on your Switch 2.\nThere will be a full Street Fighter 6 Switch 2 review going live on TechRadar Gaming in the near future. Once it's up, this section will be updated to reflect our Nintendo-specific playthrough.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"Fortnite is the biggest battle royale for a reason. Epic Games has created an ecosystem that you can get dozens of hours of play from without even touching the main Battle Royale mode. The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is a massive step up from the original Switch, thanks to its enhanced performance, and I can\u2019t think of a better way to play the game on a handheld.\" - Scott McCrae, TechRadar Gaming reviewer.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: Mouse Mode controls, improved framerate, improved visuals, greater view distances, replays, GameChat.\nFortnite received a massive upgrade for Nintendo Switch 2 at launch. Now, the game runs at a steady 60FPS (frames per second), and the Mouse Mode can be used in Battle Royale matches. The mouse controls are particularly great, allowing you to use one Joy-Con as your mouse for aiming and shooting, and the other controller for movement. It's a sort of mouse and keyboard/controller hybrid that feels fantastic to use.\nElsewhere, Fortnite offers plenty outside of the headline Battle Royale Mode. There's Lego Fortnite Odyssey, a full-blown survival crafting game, the high-stakes racing of Rocket Racing, and the Guitar Hero-throwback stylings of Fortnite Festival. That's before you add in Fortnite OG, Fortnite Ballistic, and all of the user-generated maps. If you're short of things to play on your shiny new Nintendo Switch 2, Fortnite is practically 10 games in one, with plenty of variety to keep you interested while waiting for new releases.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is the best Tony Hawk has ever been. The 1 + 2 remake set the standard, now 3 + 4 has elevated it by offering more goals and content, extra customization, and introducing new levels. It's not an easy game to master due to a high skill ceiling, but once you get to grips with it, chaining together long combos is so satisfying. Roll on the Underground remakes.\" - Ford James, TechRadar Gaming reviewer.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: Higher Resolution, Higher Framerate, HDR\nTony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 offers much the same experience as the previous remake collection, using the same engine and mission system to restore the original versions. The main difference here is that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 has been changed to match the structure of the previous three games. This mostly works, though some fans will miss the mission-based gameplay, preferring it to the now time-based challenges.\nMinor gripes aside, this is a near flawless remake of the best skateboarding games ever made. The soundtrack features some of the original songs, but has been filled out with new music from bands like Idles, Fontaines D.C., and rappers like ScHoolboyQ. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is the real highlight, with some of the best levels ever to feature in the series. The Switch 2 port is excellent, and the ability to take Tony Hawk anywhere with you is always a treat.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition brings a massive, must-play RPG to Nintendo Switch 2. Its solid performance and fantastic visuals are technically impressive and a real showcase of what the system can do. Throw in a wealth of Nintendo Switch 2-exclusive features, plus a handy progression sharing system, and you have the best way to play it on the go.\" - Dashiell Wood, TechRadar Gaming Hardware Writer.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: Better visuals, framerate, textures and performance.\nCyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition bundles together the base game, which has now received five year's worth of updates, and the excellent Phantom Liberty DLC. You'll be able to take Night City on the go with you, in what is a truly fantastic port.\nThis Nintendo Switch 2 version boasts better visuals and performance than its predecessor's, and there's extra bonuses to enjoy like mouse-mode aiming, gyro controls, and touch screen menu navigation. You can even use the motion controls to hack and slash your way through enemies. This is by no means the most graphically impressive way to play Cyberpunk 2077, but it is one of the most fun.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is already a classic, thanks to its incredible systemic open-world design that truly allows you to run wild and do whatever you\u2019d like. It gives players the tools to experiment, do silly things constantly, and make their adventure their own. And if you want to play it straight, it\u2019s a wonderful adventure game in its own right. The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is simply the game as you know it, but better, thanks to its improvements to framerate and resolution.\" - Scott McCrae, TechRadar Gaming reviewer.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: Improved visuals, improved framerate, Zelda Notes App integration.\nBreath of the Wild is absolutely worth loading up on Switch 2, now that the visuals have been cleaned up and performance improved across the board. The upgrade is transformative, fixing certain pain points like the Korok Forest - which ran poorly on the original hardware. Now, you can explore Hyrule without any technical limitations holding you back.\nWhether you've played Breath of the Wild before, you'll know that it's a modern classic at this point. While its sequel, Tears of the Kingdom, made smart changes and tweaks to the open exploration of Breath of the Wild, there's still magic to be found in the first of the series. Those who own the Switch Online Expansion Pack will receive the Switch 2 upgrade for Breath of the Wild at no extra cost. Remarkably, the now eight-year-old game still holds up, standing toe to toe with any of the newer games on this list.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"Hitman World of Assassination \u2013 Signature Edition is a decent port of an incredible stealth game, bringing hundreds, if not thousands, of hours of entertainment to Nintendo Switch 2 in a very well-rounded package. Performance could be better, and there are a few bugs in need of patches, but it's nevertheless a joy to pick up and play and almost impossible to put down.\" - Dash Wood, TechRadar Gaming Hardware Writer.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: Improved visuals, improved framerate, native version (non-Cloud).\nHitman: World of Assassination - Signature Edition brings everyone's favorite killer to the new console. Playing the game in handheld mode is a real delight, allowing you to tackle missions in bite-sized chunks and opening up a more casual way to play. Still, this is the same game that continues to receive updates to this day on other platforms, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.\nThere are a couple of Nintendo-themed clothing options, but Hitman World of Assassination is largely unchanged for Switch 2. Thankfully, the game is still absolutely brilliant, with the excellent Freelancer Mode being a real highlight. Featuring levels from the three main games, as well as a bunch added as DLC, this is a complete package that'll keep you busy for hours. Now, when are we getting 007: First Light again?\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is a charming follow-up to Link's Awakening that builds on that game\u2019s beautiful aesthetic while introducing just enough new mechanics to feel truly distinct. The dubious performance and repetitive combat can drag, but this is largely an excellent adventure throughout.\" - Dashiell Wood, TechRadar Gaming Hardware Writer.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: Improved visuals, improved framerate, Echoes favorite function added.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom was brilliant at launch; however, it did tend to run into some framerate inconsistencies quite often. On Switch 2, the game has been fixed, now running smoothly and looking gorgeous on the new hardware. There's a new feature that lets users favorite Echoes, making menu browsing much easier. In short, one of the best Switch games is even better on Switch 2.\nEchoes of Wisdom stars Zelda as the main playable character. It's much more of a puzzle-action game than Link's Awakening, with which it shares an art style. Zelda has a bunch of magical abilities that allow her to place objects on the world map, using them to overcome battles and traverse obstacles. This is a modern twist on classic Nintendo gameplay, which is really refreshing alongside the more open-world RPG-focused Zelda games on this list.\n5. Super Mario Odyssey\n\"Super Mario Odyssey doesn't discard the core mechanics of the series in quite the same way that Zelda: Breath of the Wild does, but it's fresh and different enough to what has gone before to comfortably rank as one of Mario's finest adventures in recent memory. \" - Damien McFerran, TechRadar Gaming reviewer.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: Improved visuals, improved framerate.\nSuper Mario Odyssey is a real feast for the eyes, and it now looks even better on Switch 2. Visuals have been enhanced slightly, though this is very much still the same game that debuted in 2017. It's one of the best Mario games released so far, with a globetrotting adventure taking Mario to a bunch of weird and wacky locales. Thanks to Cappy, Mario can take control of enemies, even giant ones like the T-Rex that sleeps on one particular level. This feature really stood out at launch, and it's something we praised in our original Super Mario Odyssey review.\nIf you've yet to try out Super Mario Odyssey, just know that it's a love letter to the franchise, blending 3D and 2D sections that feature neat Easter Eggs and throwbacks to older games. One particular level drops Mario in New Donk City, where he goes about gathering a band for a soaring musical number. It's pure Nintendo magic, reminding players why Mario games continue to be so popular so many years after debuting all the way back in the eighties.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"Mario Kart World is easily the standout launch title on Nintendo Switch 2. And while that may not be saying much, I anticipate it\u2019s comfortably going to be the best-selling Switch 2 game for the entire console generation. Nintendo has created a visually stunning kart racer here, chock-full of its trademark charm and personality.\" - Rhys Wood, TechRadar Gaming Hardware Editor.\nMario Kart World is the big Switch 2 launch title, and when compared to its predecessor, it's a wildly unique experience. Now, tracks are all connected on a broader open world map. Through the new Free Roam Mode, you can explore this world at your leisure, testing out your driving skills, unlocking new characters, and completing hidden challenges. So far, I've been wowed by the versatility and creativity of the driving. You can hop onto rails, ride along walls, and charge jumps to reach Coins and other boons.\nThanks to the extra power that the Nintendo Switch 2 provides, Mario Kart World looks incredible, whether that's in docked or handheld mode. Weather effects turn familiar locales into dynamic surprises. There's a whole host of outfits to unlock for the main roster, and there are even stickers that can be plastered onto your kart of choice. Simply put, Mario Kart World is a fresh new spin on the tried and tested Mario Kart formula. Knockout Tour is a real highlight, providing chaotic and tense elimination races that hinge on your ability to improvise and use items effectively. There's a whole new world to explore, and I can't wait to see what's added post-launch.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"Deltarune is a charming pixelated adventure that's not afraid to lean into the weird and wacky. This indie RPG flips the genre on its head, encouraging kindness over combat and delivering laughs in spades across its four chapters thanks to its witty writing, bizarre characters, and memorable worlds.\" - Vic Hood, TechRadar Gaming reviewer.\nDeltarune received its third and fourth chapters alongside the launch of Nintendo Switch 2. So far, the story is dazzling, telling an emotional tale that runs parallel to the events of Undertale. Fans of Undertale will find plenty to love here. There are familiar faces to meet, new allies to recruit to your team, and some truly wild twists and turns along the way. Deltarune shines on Switch 2, especially in handheld mode, allowing you to chip away at the game's chapters bit by bit.\nThere are three more chapters planned for Deltarune, but the game is already easy to recommend to Switch 2 owners. The soundtrack is second to none, combat has been updated in smart and interesting ways, and there's an overall sadness to proceedings that makes the story linger in your memory, long after you've set it down for the night.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom was already on the Mount Rushmore of video games. That said, if you weren't able to click with the original due to the performance, the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition completely revolutionizes the game. Having spent over 70 hours exploring the vast region of Hyrule in glorious HDR, I can't recommend this game enough; it's truly one of the best gaming experiences you can buy in 2025.\" - John-Anthony Disotto, TechRadar Gaming reviewer.\nSwitch 2 enhancements: Improved visuals, improved framerate, Zelda Notes App integration.\nThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom has been massively improved in its Nintendo Switch 2 version. Somehow, one of the best games ever made is now even better, with improved performance and visuals more than warranting a reason to revisit Hyrule. The new Zelda Notes app is a great companion too, featuring a sort of sat-nav that'll guide you to Shrines and Korok Seeds, and a Zelda-led narration tool that adds extra story context.\nWe played over 70 hours in our The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom review and found it to be an absolute delight, full of welcome embellishments and bold additions. One of the biggest new additions to the established formula is the new Zonai abilities, such as Ultrahand and Fuse, which add a new perspective to how you can interact with the game world. That's very much just scratching the surface of what makes this adventure RPG so special. It's still the best game you can play on Switch 2.\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\"Donkey Kong Bananza is the greatest Nintendo Switch 2 title to date, delivering an incredible destruction system that showcases the power of the new system. It\u2019s visually impressive and, while the story isn\u2019t anything to write home about, benefits from charming and expressive voice acting and animations. Throw in a seemingly endless stream of collectibles and secrets, and you have a meaty adventure that\u2019s a delight to explore.\" - Dash Wood, TechRadar Gaming Hardware Writer.\nDonkey Kong Bananza is, simply put, the best Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive released so far, and the best game on the new platform overall. While I enjoyed Mario Kart World as a launch title, I did feel that the Switch 2's initial offering could have done with a singleplayer game. Thankfully, Donkey Kong Bananza absolutely scratches this itch, arriving just six weeks after the launch of the Switch 2.\nIt feels like a true follow-up to 2017\u2019s ground-breaking Super Mario Odyssey, with everything that made that game so enjoyable dialed up to the max. You even have Pauline as a companion, as you make your way through lavish underground worlds filled with secrets and collectibles.\nBest Nintendo Switch 2 games: FAQs\nIs it still worth buying a Nintendo Switch in 2025?\nNow that the Nintendo Switch 2 is out, there are some questions over whether its predecessor is still worth picking up. Given that Switch 2 exclusives are quite rare at this point, getting a Switch for cheap is still a great idea. You'll still be able to play many of the big games coming in 2025, like Pok\u00e9mon Legends Z-A and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. Check out our Switch 2 vs Switch comparison article to see what's changed between the two.\nWhich games should I download on my Nintendo Switch 2?\nAny of the games on this list are great places to start, though there are loads of games that I'd recommend for your new console. Pok\u00e9mon Scarlet and Violet has been massively updated, fixing the frankly awful visuals and performance. Then there's Hollow Knight, which is still one of the best games to get on handheld devices. You can't go wrong with a 2D Mario game either, and I'd happily recommend Super Mario Maker 2.\nAre Nintendo Switch 2 games region locked?\nNo. Unlike some previous Nintendo home consoles, the Switch 2 is completely region-free. That means you can play physical games from other regions on your console. You will need an account from a relevant country to access its Nintendo eShop, however.\nWhat Switch 1 games are better on Switch 2?\nThe majority of Switch 1 games are better on Switch 2, though there are some that feature more substantial improvements on the new hardware. Cyberpunk 2077 has the best upgrade, though you'll need to pay for it. For a free upgrade, Fortnite and No Man's Sky are brilliant on Switch 2.\nHow we made our best Nintendo Switch games list\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 is only early on in its life, but we've been covering it since it was first announced, even going hands-on before launch day. Now, we've spent dozens of hours testing the new hardware, games, and accessories, and will continue to do so, so you know you can trust our takes and verdicts.\nHaving covered the Switch generation from the beginning, the experts at TechRadar Gaming are therefore confident in our recommendations, which will continue to be updated as new games come out in the future.\nYou Might Also Like...\n- The best indie game to play in 2025\n- The Nintendo Switch 2 launch line-up as it happened\n- Everything we know about Hollow Knight: Silksong - coming to Switch 2 in 2025\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nJake is a freelance writer who currently works regularly with TRG.

      "text": "At TechRadar Gaming, I\u2019ve been curating our best Nintendo Switch controllers buying guide for a good few years now. Throughout that time, one third-party controller has sat at the top spot for two and a half years (it\u2019ll be three in November!).\nThat would be the near-immaculate 8BitDo Ultimate controller for Nintendo Switch, which has been the gamepad I\u2019ve consistently returned to in my time with the original Switch, owing to its myriad improvements over even the excellent Nintendo Switch Pro Controller.\nNow, there certainly have been plenty of great third-party Switch controllers over the years, and I\u2019ve tested many of them - including the GameSir Tarantula Pro and the Nitro Deck. But for me, the feature set of the 8BitDo Ultimate provides a complete package with no unnecessary bells and whistles.\nYou\u2019re getting an excellent play experience and best-in-class build quality on the console - all at a very agreeable price point in 2025.\nUltimately brilliant\nSo, why has the 8BitDo Ultimate sat on our best Nintendo Switch controllers throne ever since 2022? After all, it\u2019s not like there\u2019s been a dearth of great gamepads for the console - quite the opposite, actually.\nBut what I appreciate the most about the 8BitDo Ultimate is the sheer simplicity of it. Aside from a couple of remappable buttons on the rear of the gamepad, it\u2019s a remarkably straightforward feature set - almost refreshingly so in 2022 when it was released and still now, in 2025. No built-in display, no RGB lighting, no swappable parts. I\u2019m not opposed to any of these things, for the record, but they certainly don\u2019t make or break the overall play experience for me.\nAside from the lack of near field communication (NFC) for amiibo scanning, the 8BitDo Ultimate feels precisely like an upgraded version of the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. Superb build quality, better-feeling buttons, gyro support, and an included charging dock all contribute to a better value package overall. Price is a factor, too, of course. While the gamepad launched at $69.99 / \u00a359.99, it can reliably be found for much less given its age (it\u2019s only $49.99 at Amazon US at the time of writing, for example).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nHallowed Hall\nWhat really put the 8BitDo Ultimate on the map, though, is its Hall effect thumbsticks. While certainly not the first controller to feature stick drift-combating technology, it arguably popularized it on Switch. I\u2019ve owned the controller since its release and used it regularly on both Switch on PC, and those sticks have yet to give up on me. That\u2019s years of reliability that simply isn\u2019t offered by Nintendo\u2019s first-party kit like the Joy-Con or even the Switch Pro Controller.\nFor me, the only area where the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller wins out is in battery life. Nintendo\u2019s pad has a seriously strong reputation in this regard, able to last upwards of a staggering 40 hours. Few controllers - if any, on all platforms - are able to match this. It\u2019s a frankly absurd amount of battery life to the point where I\u2019m always surprised when I get that \u2018low battery\u2019 warning on Switch.\nThat said, the 8BitDo Ultimate doesn\u2019t perform terribly, at around 15-20 hours, which I discovered during my testing phase with the controller. That\u2019s actually cut above many wireless controllers, which tend to top out at around 10-12 hours on a single charge. And with the included charging dock, you have a handy way of getting the Ultimate back up to full charge in just a couple of hours.\nSo what\u2019s the use case for the 8BitDo Ultimate controller in 2025? After all, the pad has been succeeded by the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 - a tremendous controller in its own right.\nHowever, the Switch-compatible version of the Ultimate 2 is a touch more expensive. It does have superb TMR thumbsticks, which do an even better job of combating stick drift, but this is balanced out by slightly worse battery life, at around 10-15 hours in my testing. You can\u2019t go wrong with either controller, but the original Ultimate is the one to go for if you\u2019re budget-conscious.\nFurthermore, the 8BitDo Ultimate is now compatible with Nintendo Switch 2 thanks to a recent firmware update. That\u2019s exceptional news if you took one look at the Switch 2 Pro Controller price and figured you\u2019d prefer to look elsewhere.\nYou might also like...\n- I ditched my premium gaming headset for audiophile headphones \u2013 here's why I might not go back\n- Move over ROG Xbox Ally \u2013 the real first portable Xbox is here, and it\u2019s a gorgeous VR headset\n- Nacon Revolution X Unlimited vs Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot \u2013 here\u2019s what I learned testing two of the year\u2019s most interesting Xbox controllers\nRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for over four years.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nWhile practically unchanged in design, the Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded brings some sound upgrades to what was already an excellent PS5 controller. Its swappable, customizable modules are an idea that hasn\u2019t been done better elsewhere, and the excellent build quality and performance are well-suited for competitive players. Improvements are slight when compared to its predecessor, but are nonetheless welcome.\nPros\n- +\nFirm, grippy build quality\n- +\nExcellently customizable\n- +\nSmart module design\n- +\nHall effect sticks and triggers are a great upgrade\n- +\nImproved Fightpad module\nCons\n- -\nNot a huge upgrade if you own the original\n- -\nNo fault of its own, but no haptics or adaptive triggers\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nVictrix Pro BFG Reloaded: one-minute review\nThe Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded is a new, upgraded version of the original Victrix Pro BFG, which was originally released back in 2023.\nCompatible with PlayStation consoles, an Xbox version hit the market roughly a year later. Thankfully, the Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded is immediately available as two versions for either console family, so you won\u2019t be left out in the cold whether you\u2019re Team Blue or Green.\nOur original Victrix Pro BFG review (and that of the Xbox version) covers pretty much everything you need to know about the controller. This Reloaded model is a very similar beast outside of some welcome improvements and some slight aesthetic changes, so that\u2019s what this review is primarily going to be focused on.\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a cream-of-the-crop PS5 controller, then, and you don\u2019t own the original Victrix Pro BFG, then the Reloaded version is definitely the one to go for.\nThanks to the addition of Hall effect sticks and triggers, as well as an improved Fightpad module, it\u2019s easily one of the best PS5 controllers I\u2019ve ever tested, and as premium gamepads go, I vastly prefer it to the likes of the DualSense Edge and Scuf Reflex Pro.\nVictrix Pro BFG Reloaded: price and availability\n- $209.99 / \u00a3179.99 (around AU$322)\n- Available from September 28, 2025\n- Slightly pricier than the original in the US\nAt $209.99 / \u00a3179.99, the Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded is 30 bucks pricier than the launch price of the original Pro BFG in the US, but retains the same price point in the UK. The controller is available to pre-order now at Turtle Beach\u2019s website, and is currently slated to ship on September 28, 2025.\nAs far as premium PS5 controllers go, the Reloaded's price point is pretty ballpark. Similar luxury controllers like the DualSense Edge or Nacon Revolution 5 Pro come in at $199.99 / \u00a3199.99 / AU$399.95 and $199.99 / \u00a3199.99 (around AU$316), respectively.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nVictrix Pro BFG Reloaded review: Specs\nPrice | $209.99 / \u00a3179.99 (around AU$322) |\nWeight | 9.3oz / 265g |\nDimensions | 6.3 x 4.1 x 2.4in / 160 x 105 x 60mm |\nCompatibility | PS5, PS4, PC (Xbox version sold separately) |\nConnection type | Wireless (2.4GHz), Wired (USB-C) |\nBattery life | Around 20 hours |\nVictrix Pro BFG Reloaded review: design and features\n- Solid build quality\n- Some minor aesthetic differences compared to the original Pro BFG\n- Includes several accessories, modules, and a carry case\nPut the Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded side by side with its older sibling, and you may need to squint to see the differences. Size and silhouette are the exact same, and this new pad is differentiated only by some slight aesthetic adjustments. Namely, the grips now have a greyish outline, while the thumbstick base swaps the original\u2019s bold purple for a sleek grey. The \u2018Victrix\u2019 text on the right module also sees that color change, but that\u2019s really it.\nThe similarities extend to the included parts and modules. The controller is still housed in that compact Victrix carry case. And inside that, you\u2019ve got a swappable Fightpad module, two alternate d-pads (in addition to the excellent diamond-shaped one affixed to the pad by default), two swappable thumbsticks, and a pair of octagonal thumbstick gates. A 2.4GHz dongle and 30ft cable are also packed in, giving you two connectivity options.\nJust like the first Pro BFG, the unique selling point here is those customizable modules. In brief, these can be taken out or slotted in using the included screwdriver.\nThere are plenty of use cases for such a feature, including choosing between symmetrical or asymmetrical stick layouts, opting for a southpaw layout for left-handed players, and, of course, using the included Fightpad module for play with the best fighting games.\nThe Fightpad module here is a definite improvement. The \u2018Fightpad\u2019 logo has been pushed to the bottom, with the six buttons now higher up. It\u2019s a small change, but one that I found to be more comfortable and gave my thumbs a bit more room during gameplay.\nVictrix Pro BFG Reloaded review: Performance\nThe Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded is, largely, aimed at competitively-minded players. All the hallmarks of such a pad are here: four remappable buttons on the rear, adjustable trigger stops, and a handful of swappable accessories as mentioned above. As with the original pad, these can all be customized on the fly, and you can even swap between profiles for different games.\nEvery multiplayer-focused controller should at the very least have Hall effect thumbsticks, and it was always a confusing omission to me with the original Pro BFG. Thankfully, they\u2019re here now, along with Hall effect triggers, which should make for a much longer-lasting controller now that stick drift shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\nWhile the Pro BFG Reloaded is aimed at the competitive market, it\u2019s still an impressively versatile controller that can be used casually. I tested a wide variety of titles across a broad range of genres on PS5 and PC, including Ninja Gaiden Ragebound, Zenless Zone Zero, Street Fighter 6, Tekken 8, Final Fantasy 14 Online, PUBG Battlegrounds, and Tony Hawk\u2019s Pro Skater 3 + 4. Across all games, the BFG Pro Reloaded offered a comfortable and responsive gameplay experience.\nShould I buy the Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded?\nBuy it if...\nYou play a ton of online multiplayer\nThe Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded is designed primarily for you in this case. With Hall effect sticks, remappable buttons, and swappable modules, it\u2019s a pro-minded player\u2019s ideal controller in more ways than one.\nYou don\u2019t have space for a traditional fight stick\nFighting game fans are likely to get plenty of use out of the Pro BFG Reloaded thanks to its revised Fightpad module. Its six-button is ideal for games like Street Fighter 6 and Guilty Gear Strive.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou already own the original pad or a DualSense Edge\nGiven the commanding price tag of the BFG Pro Reloaded, it\u2019s hard to justify paying for this one if you already own a similarly premium PS5 controller, especially when the upgrades are welcome but slight overall.\nVictrix Pro BFG Reloaded review: Also consider\nThere are other premium controller options out there for PS5. Consider the following two options if the BFG Pro Reloaded isn\u2019t quite what you\u2019re after.\n| Row 0 - Cell 0 | Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded | DualSense Edge | Nacon Revolution 5 Pro |\nPrice | $209.99 / \u00a3179.99 (around AU$322) | $199.99 / \u00a3199.99 / AU$399.95 | $199.99 / \u00a3199.99 (around AU$316) |\nWeight | 9.3oz / 265g | 11.4oz / 322g | 10.9oz / 308g |\nDimensions | 6.3 x 4.1 x 2.4in / 160 x 105 x 60mm | 6.3 x 4.2 x 2.6in / 160 x 106 x 66mm | 7.5 x 7.4 x 3.5in / 190 x 189 x 89mm |\nCompatibility | PS5, PS4, PC (Xbox version sold separately) | PS5, PC | PS5, PS4, PC |\nConnection type | Wireless (2.4GHz), Wired (USB-C) | Wireless (PS5 native), Wired (USB-C) | Wireless (2.4GHz), Wired (USB-C) |\nBattery life | Around 20 hours | 5-6 hours | Around 10 hours |\nDualSense Edge\nAn excellent, if pricey, upgrade over the standard DualSense. The Edge doesn\u2019t offer Hall effect sticks, but includes all the DualSense\u2019s marvelous features while adding some handy remappable buttons, trigger locks, and a set of accessories.\nRead our full DualSense Edge review\nNacon Revolution 5 Pro\nDeveloped in tandem with professional Street Fighter player Nathan \u2018Mr. Crimson\u2019 Massol, Nacon\u2019s premium PS5 pad impresses with solid build quality and battery life, and is designed from the ground up for competitive play.\nRead our full Nacon Revolution 5 Pro review\nHow I tested the Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded\n- Tested for a week\n- Played a wide range of PS5 and PC games\n- Compared directly to the original Pro BFG model\nI tested the Victrix Pro BFG Reloaded over the course of a week for this review. In that time, I endeavored to play a smorgasbord of excellent PS5 and PC games, particularly ones with online multiplayer environments.\nAs I was already familiar with the original Pro BFG, I felt right at home testing this new model. It\u2019s a familiar yet fresh-feeling pad thanks to its welcome upgrades. And as an avid Tekken 8 and Street Fighter 6 player, I had tons of fun playing with the included and improved Fightpad module.\nFirst reviewed August 2025\nRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for over four years.

      "text": "I\u2019ve been a fool. For the past couple of decades, I\u2019ve put off trying out the massively popular online role-playing game (RPG) RuneScape. Even as a kid back in the early 2000s, I was always under the impression that its limited visuals and obtuse game systems would have me bouncing off in minutes, despite most of my friends being hooked on it.\nThose same friends from my school days are still playing the game to this day, via developer Jagex\u2019s Old School RuneScape (OSRS) release that preserves the game as it was back then, still with a steady stream of substantial content updates. Now, after a recent Dungeons & Dragons session where the conversation landed on the game, I finally caved and downloaded Old School RuneScape on my PC. And I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong about it.\nDespite its dated appearance and myriad systems and quests, Old School RuneScape is a deceptively simple game that has aged like the finest of wines. It\u2019s incredibly easy to get into in 2025, and an abundance of community-driven resources make jumping in to do quests or level some skills a (mostly) straightforward and intoxicating endeavor. I genuinely wish I\u2019d jumped on the bandwagon as a teenager, because Old School RuneScape is still one of the most rewarding and refreshing gaming experiences you can have today.\nIt takes a Lumbridge\nRuneScape takes place in the vast, vast land of Gielinor - a place that simultaneously feels like the largest and densest I\u2019ve ever seen in a video game. With countless towns, cities, landmarks, land masses, and oddities off the beaten track, there\u2019s an astonishing level of detail that you just won\u2019t find even in the biggest AAA games of today.\nThe iconic starting town of Lumbridge is a perfect microcosm of Old School RuneScape as a whole. It\u2019s loaded with shops and places to hone your various skills (of which there are a lot), and its relatively central nature means you can branch off in basically any direction to start an adventure.\nAnd there are plenty of adventures (not to mention dangers) to experience across Gielinor. As a brand new player, the in-game activity adviser does a fantastic job of highlighting recommended quests. Quests are a huge part of Old School RuneScape, and most feel like they unlock something substantial upon completion. That could be powerful weapons or armor, massive boosts to skill experience, or even entirely new areas and fast travel options.\nYes, this is not a game where you can just fast-travel on a dime. At least not initially. In most cases, the ability to teleport to specific locations is something you have to earn. That could be in the form of specific teleportation spells, or networks of gliders, ships, minecarts, and the like. Much of your travel in OSRS will be on foot, and that can be a thrilling and dangerous experience.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWhat I found most terrifying is that dying in Old School RuneScape can have very real and disastrous consequences. If you bite off a bit more than you can chew, you will lose nearly everything except the clothes on your back, and you\u2019ll have 15 minutes to travel back to where you died to loot your inventory from a grave stone. Those corpse runs you do in all the best soulslike games? Yeah, they're nothing compared to this.\n15 minutes sounds generous, but if you die far from Lumbridge (where you\u2019ll respawn) without any fast travel options unlocked, you\u2019ll start wishing you had at least double that. As a result, I found myself making liberal use of the bank to store everything that wasn\u2019t absolutely required for my current quest or skilling session.\nI am Iron Man\nI\u2019m playing Old School RuneScape as an \u2018Ironman\u2019 character, as recommended by a friend. There is one key restriction that Ironmen have to deal with, and that\u2019s the inability to make use of the Grand Exchange (or \u2018GE\u2019), a player-driven market hub where you can buy anything from resources to weapons and other useful items with in-game gold.\nWithout access to the Grand Exchange, you have to source absolutely everything yourself. Need 20 balls of wool for a quest? You need to find a pair of shears, go to town on some sheep, then spin the wool yourself. Collecting four distinct colored balls from imps? Farm them and hope they drop within a reasonable amount of time.\nIt sounds like a pain, and it certainly can be if your mindset is just wanting to get quests done ASAP for the rewards. But there is a distinct sense of achievement in completing quests, knowing you did all the legwork on your own. It\u2019s an experience that both teaches and demands patience. Of course, community-driven resources like the OSRS Wiki certainly help (as well as the RuneLite client\u2019s incredible Quest Helper plugin), but this only serves to point you in the right direction. You still have to put in the manual labor without relying on the GE as a crutch.\nOverall, Ironman Old School RuneScape is one of the most fun and thrilling gaming experiences I\u2019ve had in years. In an age where many AAA games can often feel interchangeable - with abundant fast travel, groan-worthy percentage-based skill upgrades, and \u2018convenient\u2019 microtransactions - OSRS has been extremely refreshing.\nWith a colossal world to explore, upgrades and skills earned through effort, and no shortage of low-poly charm, it\u2019s a game I can see myself struggling to put down for years to come. I just wish I\u2019d set off on this journey sooner.\nYou might also like...\n- I'm a Legend of Zelda superfan \u2013 can you beat my ultimate Zelda trivia quiz?\n- I\u2019ve played the first chapter of Ninja Gaiden 4, and it\u2019s hitting all the right notes with blood-soaked combat and punishing difficulty\n- WWE 2K25 shows the Switch 2 is lightyears ahead of its predecessor when it comes to sports games, and I couldn\u2019t be happier\nRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for over four years.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nWith its modular nature and long battery life, the Victrix Pro BFG stands above many similarly priced PS5 controllers. There are features here that you won\u2019t find on any other PS5 gamepad, and a price that undercuts the majority of the competition as well.\nPros\n- +\nModular design\n- +\nExcellent build quality\n- +\nHighly customizable\nCons\n- -\nPremium price tag\n- -\nLacks DualSense features\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe Victrix BFG Pro is the first enthusiast-grade PS5 controller made by the brand. Like other officially licensed gamepads, it lacks the DualSense's adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. However, Victrix replaces this functionality with a fully modular, lightweight chassis ideal for competitive gaming.\nGiven all that\u2019s on offer here, the Victrix BFG Pro is easily one of the best PS5 controllers on the market, even though it\u2019s a vastly different experience from the standard DualSense. If you\u2019re after something different for your PS5 gaming setup, this third-party offering could be what you\u2019ve been waiting for.\nPrice and availability\nYou can currently get your hands on the Victrix BFG Pro for $179.99 / \u00a3179.99 / AU$269 as this PS5 controller is now widely available from most big box outlets in the US, the UK, and Australia. As with many third-party PS5 controllers, this one is also substantially more than what you\u2019ll pay for the standard DualSense; however, it's considerably cheaper than the DualSense Edge, Scuf Reflex Pro, and the Razer Wolverine V2 Pro.\nDesign and Features\nThe Victrix BFG Pro keeps things aesthetically straightforward with its ergonomic black finish and purple accents, with a purple X coming through the touchpad when connected. You\u2019ll notice straight away the modules that come screwed into the left and right sides of the controller and come out of the box in an asymmetric layout.\nThe biggest strength of this third-party PS5 gamepad is that you can take the included hex screwdriver and make changes to the Victrix BFG Pro, depending on what you want to play. This could be anything from the personal preference, swapping the order of the sticks around to the in-line position, or replacing the four face buttons and second analog stick with a dedicated microswitch-enabled fightpad instead.\nFunctional customization is the name of the game with this controller. Included in the box are two additional D-pads, varying stick lengths, and octagonal gates for those analog sticks. Equally in the Victrix BFG Pro\u2019s favor is the clutch trigger mechanism. These are two sliders on the back of the remote that can be finely adjusted for varying levels of control, with everything from the instant mouse click of an instant reaction, to the full pull or something in the middle. There are five levels to choose from, which you can easily tweak between different genres with minimal effort.\nThe Victrix BFG Pro also features remappable paddles on the back. We\u2019ve seen this from other high-end gamepads on the PS5, but it\u2019s also good to see it included here. The trade-off is that you\u2019re forgoing the haptic feedback and the adaptive triggers of the DualSense for this level of modularity. Where the Victrix BFG Pro wins points above the likes of the Razer Wolverine V2, another esports-focused pad that ditched DualSense features, is that it replaced them with something meaningful.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nYou can connect up to your PS5, PS4, or gaming PC through either the 3m long braided USB-C cable or the included 2.4 GHz wireless dongle. Victrix parent company PDP claims that its controller lasts up to 20 hours on a single charge, which is more or less what I noted in my experience. It has more juice than most of the competition, which is great if you enjoy marathon-level gaming sessions like me. I must admit, due to the generous cable length, I spent quite a while plugged in, too.\nPerformance\nThe Victrix Pro BFG is one of the nicest feeling controllers I\u2019ve had in my hands for a long time. The sticks, buttons, bumpers, and triggers feel especially responsive. Throughout my testing with this gamepad, I removed the stock square D-pad and replaced it with a more traditional eight-way one that you would find on the Xbox Wireless Controller. The level of freedom to have the setup exactly as I wanted was a novelty that still hasn\u2019t completely worn off.\nI experimented a lot with the various clutch trigger settings and found myself most comfortable going for either hairline or full pull rather than relying on the middle ground. This meant I could more easily pull off headshots in twitch-based games like Battlefield 2042 and also enjoy full control in Ride 4 without choosing an in-between. One thing I love about the Victrix BFG Pro is how it\u2019s recognized as a native Xbox Series X controller by a gaming PC which means you don\u2019t have to jump through the same hoops as you would when trying to connect with a DualSense. It adds extra value as a controller you can use across multiple systems without worry, and when you\u2019re paying this much,, that\u2019s the least we should expect.\nThe Victrix BFG Pro is also one of the best fightpads I\u2019ve ever used. Initially, I didn\u2019t think much of the module you could swap in but after a few rounds with some old favorite games, it was immediately clear to me just how versatile it is. Considering it only takes a few seconds to unscrew and swap out the pieces, and that everything is stored in a hardback carrying case, there\u2019s a good chance this controller could effectively replace your dedicated fightpad, as it did with my Hori Fighting Commander Octa. If you want to be ready for Street Fighter 6 and Tekken 8 then you\u2019re in good hands here. Not quite a rival for the best fight sticks, but a good sight better than a regular controller.\nI have had my hands on many PS5 controllers recently, and I argued that you shouldn\u2019t bother with them as the DualSense is good enough. I think that the tide is changing with the Victrix BFG Pro because it adds far more than it takes away from the fundamental experience. If you\u2019re someone who can\u2019t live without haptic feedback and adaptive triggers then the DualSense Edge or Scuf Reflex Pro could be better buys, but for the dedicated eSports gamer and fighting game fan, I\u2019m yet to find better on the platform.\nFormerly TechRadar Gaming's Hardware Editor, Aleksha McLoughlin is now a freelance writer and editor specializing in computing tech, video games, and E-commerce.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot stands out from the crowd of third-party Xbox controllers with its swiveling \u2018pivot\u2019 modules that let players swap that traditional two thumbstick layout for alternate control schemes. These alternatives are actually great for fighting games and retro (or retro-themed) titles. However, the act of swapping them around is fairly cumbersome. Plus, the addition of a Stealth Ultra-like onboard display is a nice inclusion, but a perhaps unnecessary one given that it\u2019s likely the reason the Stealth Pivot costs as much as it does.\nPros\n- +\nPlenty versatile thanks to those Pivot modules\n- +\nOn-pad display is simple, intuitive, and robust\n- +\nThumbsticks and triggers feel especially great\n- +\nButtons, d-pad, and bumpers all feel nice, too\n- +\nImpressive 20-hour battery life\nCons\n- -\nSwiveling those Pivot modules is a clumsy process\n- -\nThe display, while nice, feels like feature creep\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nTurtle Beach Stealth Pivot: one-minute review\nThe Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot is an Xbox and PC controller that I want to love. It gets a ton right, from its solid build quality and impressive battery life to its drift-resistant thumbsticks and all-around great-feeling buttons, bumpers, and triggers. As a controller, it ticks all the right boxes on its way to being an easy recommendation.\nI\u2019m a big fan of that titular feature, too. The pad\u2019s two \u2018Pivot\u2019 modules allow you to swap from that traditional two thumbstick layout to something well-suited to arcade and fighting games. As such, the Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot is impressively versatile and well-suited to both competitive and easy-going retro play.\nThere are some design flaws, however, that stop the Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot from being a slam dunk. For one, the act of \u2018pivoting\u2019 those modules is a pretty cumbersome three-stage process that requires you to unlock those modules, swivel them manually, and then lock them back into place.\nFurthermore, I\u2019m a little baffled by the inclusion of a Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra-like display. It\u2019s certainly nice to have and its intuitiveness makes customizing your controller experience a breeze. But it has almost certainly made the Stealth Pivot cost more than it would\u2019ve been without and somewhat muddles the design of the controller overall.\nI like the Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot a lot. But I feel that its unique selling point could shine more at a lower price point without the on-board display and with some more refinement to the overall pivoting process.\nTurtle Beach Stealth Pivot: price and availability\n- $129.99 / \u00a3119.99 / AU$249.95\n- Available from Turtle Beach and other major retailers\n- A price in between the Recon and Stealth Ultra\nThe Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot is available to buy now for $129.99 / \u00a3119.99 / AU$249.95. It can be bought from Turtle Beach directly or from retailers such as Best Buy in the US, Argos in the UK, and Amazon in all regions.\nIn the broader range of Turtle Beach controllers, the Stealth Pivot finds itself much pricier than the Turtle Beach Recon controller ($59.95 / \u00a349.99 / AU$99.95) but also much cheaper than the premium Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra ($199.99 / \u00a3179.99 / around AU$329.95. Overall, the Stealth Pivot finds itself in roughly the same price bracket as the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 Core ($129.99 / \u00a3114.99 / AU$189.95).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe Stealth Pivot appears to come in at a pretty decent mid-range price, then. However I feel it could have been a more tempting option were it to be closer to the $100 / \u00a3100 mark and if it exclusively focused on the Pivot feature - saving that built-in screen solely for the Stealth Ultra instead.\nTurtle Beach Stealth Pivot: specs\n| Price | $129.99 / \u00a3119.99 / AU$249.95 |\n| Dimensions | 6.3in x 4.7in x 2.5in / 160mm x 119mm x 64mm |\n| Weight | 0.66lbs / 300g |\n| Compatibility | Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC |\n| Connection type | Wireless (2.4 GHz, PC only), Wired (USB Type-C) |\n| Battery life | 20 hours |\n| Software | Control Center 2 (Xbox and PC) |\nTurtle Beach Stealth Pivot: design and features\n- Overall excellent build quality\n- Pivot tech is the standout feature\n- Also features a built-in display, which doesn\u2019t feel essential\nThe Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot largely impresses in the design department. It\u2019s a largely plastic build here, but it\u2019s all of a very high quality and feels nice in the hands - even if it\u2019s a touch bulkier than most Xbox Wireless Controller-silhouetted gamepads.\nWhile the rear of the grips isn\u2019t textured here, the front features subtly textured pads that rest easy against the palms of your hands. Meanwhile, the bumpers, triggers, and rear remappable buttons have a more pronounced, bumpy texture that feels great overall. I\u2019m also a huge fan of the smooth, circular d-pad which I found to be excellent for fighting games.\nThe Stealth Pivot suits the fighting game genre to a tee, actually. And that\u2019s where we get into the pad\u2019s standout feature: those bespoke Pivot modules. There\u2019s one on each side of the controller, both kitted with two distinct layouts. By default, the controller\u2019s pivots are set to the traditional two-thumbstick layout. The left module\u2019s other side features a d-pad and two buttons, while the right bears a six-button layout.\nIt\u2019s a neat feature that goes a long way to making the Stealth Pivot stand out from the crowd. It\u2019s a shame, then, that the whole pivoting process can be quite awkward. For starters, you\u2019ll need to unlock the pivots by toggling the unusually stiff switches on the rear of the pad. Then, you twist the thumbsticks clockwise to press them inwards, ensuring that they can be housed within the controller. Next comes the swivel itself before locking the Pivot modules again. It\u2019s a pretty clumsy process overall and one I feel could use some refinement if the Stealth Pivot ever gets an improved follow-up.\nAside from some very effective trigger locks with distinct analog and digital settings, the remaining standout feature of the Stealth Pivot is its built-in display. It\u2019s effective and unintrusive, activated by pressing a small \u2018+\u2019 button at the bottom of the controller. The Stealth Pivot\u2019s inputs will then interact with the display\u2019s options instead of your game until you hit that \u2018+\u2019 button again.\nThe display\u2019s options are simple but have pretty much everything you\u2019d want while gaming without overcomplicating things. You can switch between up to five button profiles (which you can create via the downloadable Control Center 2 app on Xbox and PC), monitor battery life, adjust headset volume should you have one plugged in via the 3.5mm port, and check for firmware updates.\nIt\u2019s a nice addition, but one I feel isn\u2019t much of a necessity, especially as it doesn\u2019t really enhance the unique selling point of those Pivot modules. As mentioned, I wouldn\u2019t have minded if the controller stuck to the Pivot modules as the one standout feature, which may have allowed it to come in at a slightly lower asking price while still maintaining what makes this controller special.\nTurtle Beach Stealth Pivot: performance\n- Turtle Beach\u2019s AntiDrift sticks are sharply responsive\n- Excellent feeling buttons, triggers, and bumpers\n- Excels at competitive shooters, fighting games, and retro titles\nIt\u2019s much less of a mixed bag for the Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot on the performance front. The Hall effect-like AntiDrift thumbsticks here are sublime, for starters. Not only are they seemingly long-lasting, but they\u2019re also incredibly smooth and responsive, making them perfect for fast-paced competitive games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Marvel Rivals. The trigger stops work well here, too, with the option for quick-press digital triggers proving a boon in said shooters.\nWhile I have issues with the implementation of those Pivot modules, they\u2019re actually great in practice. If you\u2019re a regular fighting game player, you\u2019ve effectively got two controllers in one here, with the six-button setup on the right Pivot module being reminiscent of the Victrix Pro BFG\u2019s dedicated fight pad module. I found this to be excellent for Street Fighter 6 and Tekken 8 where having quick access to those extra buttons allowed for much smoother play overall.\nThis more arcade-like button layout also means the Stealth Pivot is a great fit for retro gaming. I tested various old-school compilations with the controller, including Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics, Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection, and UFO 50. The alternative controls presented by the Pivot modules allow for a very comfortable experience here for games that are largely better suited for d-pad controls and quick, responsive button presses.\nIn terms of battery life, I managed around 21-22 hours on a full charge here, which is in line with the quoted \u201820+ hours\u2019 on Turtle Beach\u2019s website. However, keep in mind that a wireless connection via the included 2.4GHz dongle only works on PC and mobile. For Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One, you\u2019ll unfortunately need to rely on a wired connection.\nShould you buy the Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot?\nBuy it if...\nYou play a wide variety of games\nThe Stealth Pivot really shines across a variety of specific genres, including shooters, fighting games, and retro titles. Thanks to the Pivot feature and button profile mapping, it\u2019s easy to create a diverse range of setups for responsive and comfortable play.\nYou enjoy customizing controls to fit your style\nYou can create up to five distinct button layout profiles via the Control Center 2 app on Xbox and PC, then quick-switch through all of them via the controller\u2019s built-in screen.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou wanted something less bulky\nIf you\u2019ve got smaller hands, you might not get on with the Stealth Pivot\u2019s relatively larger size compared to other third-party controllers. In this case, a sleeker controller like the GameSir Tarantula Pro or the Xbox Wireless Controller might be a better fit.\nYou want something more straightforward\nThe Stealth Pivot is swimming in features, which likely also has pushed its price upwards.

I absolutely loved using the Pivot modules for titles like Street Fighter 6, Tekken 8, UFO 50, and Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection. I also got liberal use out of the standard thumbstick layout, loading up some Final Fantasy 14 Online, Marvel Rivals, and Path of Exile 2.\nI largely played on PC, with some testing on the Xbox Series X Digital Edition paired with an LG CX OLED TV and Razer BlackShark V2 X gaming headset. Overall, I conclude that the Pivot modules give the controller a rather niche appeal due to their effective nature with certain game genres. However, for players who regularly play competitive shooters or fighting games, this could easily be a four-out-of-five or higher gamepad for you.\nFirst reviewed December 2024\nRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for over four years.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nIf you\u2019re looking for a premium PlayStation 5 controller with all the trimmings - swappable modules, trigger locks, remappable profiles, and more - then the Revolution 5 Pro will serve you well. Some design issues though, like a lack of vibration for PS5 games, hold it back.\nPros\n- +\nFantastic build quality with superb non-slip grips\n- +\nSmartly designed alternate modules suit a variety of games\n- +\nConvenient on-board controls for headset and mic volume\nCons\n- -\nLacks haptics and vibration for PS5 games\n- -\nRear buttons are a little too sensitive\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nNacon\u2019s Revolution 5 Pro seriously impresses as a higher-end PlayStation 5 gamepad. A multiplayer-first controller, owing to its on-board audio controls and customizable back buttons, it features high-quality modules (some of which have swappable variants included in-box), Hall effect-ready that rely on magnets and voltage control to reduce the risk of drift, and a sturdy build that\u2019s resistant to scuffs and wear.\nIt\u2019s one of the most feature-rich controllers available for PS5, but it\u2019s not without some rather unfortunate issues that stop it just short of making our best PS5 controllers list. The mappable rear buttons, for example, are a little too easy to accidentally press, and you won\u2019t be able to enjoy features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers that the PS5\u2019s DualSense offers. That can\u2019t be avoided, as Sony only allows such tech for its own peripherals, but the Revolution 5 Pro also lacks vibration functionality for PS5 games.\nHowever, those issues aside, Nacon has still built a versatile and high-quality gamepad that should be considered if you value build quality, battery life, and swappable modules.\nPrice and availability\nThe Nacon Revolution 5 Pro is available to buy right now for $199.99 / \u00a3199.99 (around AU$316), from Nacon\u2019s own website. However, be aware that buying outside of Europe will come with a pretty hefty customs charge right now, so you may wish to wait until December 1 when the controller becomes more widely available at retailers in the US and UK.\nThe Revolution 5 Pro\u2019s closest competitor in terms of price is Sony\u2019s DualSense Edge, which comes in at $199.99 / \u00a3209.99 / AU$339.95. While it\u2019s not any cheaper, the PS5\u2019s premium controller does offer proprietary features like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, which third-party pads like the Revolution 5 Pro sadly lack.\nDesign and features\nThe Revolution 5 Pro immediately reveals itself as a pad that\u2019s incredibly pleasing to hold. It\u2019s an all-plastic build but one that\u2019s of very high quality. It\u2019s sturdy, too, but the choice of material here does mean it\u2019s a bit of a fingerprint magnet, which does mean the aesthetic can be impacted by your hands regardless of whether you opt for the white or black colorway.\nThe controller comes with three sets of weights that can be inserted into the pad\u2019s grips by removing the back panels, which slide in and out of place with ease. At 10g / 14g / 16g extra each, they don\u2019t add a ton of additional weight, but they\u2019re useful in helping the pad rest in your hands a little more securely should you require it.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAs for swappable modules, you\u2019ve got three alternative choices for analog sticks: an extra convex stick, as well as two concaves, one of which has a taller profile. By default, the Revolution 5 Pro is fitted with a circular D-pad which I found well-suited for performing more complex inputs in the best fighting games. There\u2019s a traditional four-way D-pad in the box, too. Both analog sticks are able to be swapped out, as well as the D-pad, by lifting them from the foundation.\nOne of the best aspects of the Revolution 5 Pro\u2019s design is its textured grips. Slight contours running down the controller\u2019s grips means it rests firmly in the hands, and I never once found myself needing to reposition the pad, even during hectic multiplayer moments in titles like Fall Guys and Fortnite.\nThere are some lovely extra functional touches here, too, like an on-board battery indicator, signified by a row of five white LEDs situated just under the central touchpad. If you\u2019re playing wirelessly, it\u2019s a convenient way to know when you need to charge at a glance. The central pad itself doesn\u2019t bear any touch-sensitive functionality, but Nacon has cleverly repurposed it for multiplayer usage; by holding down the Function button on top of the controller, you\u2019re able to adjust headset and mic volume by pressing the edges of the touchpad.\nPerformance and battery life\nThe Revolution 5 Pro controller, like other third-party gamepads designed for PS5, is somewhat kneecapped by the absence of haptics, adaptive triggers, and vibration for the best PS5 games. However, it\u2019s worth noting that this isn\u2019t the fault of the manufacturer; Sony simply doesn\u2019t allow the use of such tech beyond its own controllers. Thankfully, vibration is enabled for PS4 and PC titles. If you like having a rumble feature enabled during play, then, the Revolution 5 Pro may serve you better as a desktop gamepad.\nOne area the controller itself improves on its competitors is in wireless response time. Expect a latency of 6m/s if you\u2019re playing with the included 2.4GHz USB dongle on PS5, and 4m/s on PC. Its closest rival here is likely the Razer Wolverine V2 Pro, which clocks in at an average of 10m/s when used wirelessly. This means the Revolution 5 Pro is ultra-responsive for the best single-player games. But, I would still recommend opting for a wired connection if you\u2019re playing games where frame data is a crucial element, such as Street Fighter 6 or Call of Duty: Warzone where split-second inputs matter.\nGenerally though, the act of simply playing with the Revolution 5 Pro is excellent. Its analog sticks travel smoothly, and there\u2019s a satisfying level of bounciness to the shoulder and face buttons. There\u2019s very short travel time on the buttons that allows for quick, timely inputs in your favorite multiplayer games, which feels subconsciously fantastic when playing games online with others. That same feeling can be applied to the R2/L2-equivalents via the hair trigger locks on the back. That said, I did find these locks to be a little stiff, as they need to be pressed inwards and upwards in order to activate the effect.\nI found the Revolution 5 Pro controller to be an admirable fit for solo play, too. It excels especially with games that require quick reflexes, or have high skill ceilings. The moment-to-moment decision-making of Doom Eternal, for example, felt more surmountable at its higher difficulty levels. Similarly, I\u2019ve never been able to be quite this reactive in Tetris Effect Connected; that low wireless response time eking out some truly clutch block placements at higher speeds.\nThe rear paddle buttons are a little too sensitive for my liking, though. This often led me to activate inputs I\u2019d assigned there - such as jumping or tossing a grenade - to register when I didn\u2019t want them to. I did find them useful, however, as a means of activating alternate hotbars in Final Fantasy 14 Online; a simple double-tap was used here to highlight hotbars that are normally accessed with the triggers by default.\nBattery life, meanwhile, is about what you should expect for a controller of this caliber. You\u2019ll get roughly ten hours on a full charge. Not amazing by any means, but certainly an improvement over the DualSense Edge\u2019s four-to-six hour battery life.\nSoftware\nThe Nacon Revolution 5 Pro app is available to download for Windows and MacOS devices from the controller's support page. A mobile version of the app can also be downloaded on iOS devices, with an Android version coming soon.\nThe app itself is thorough, but extremely easy to get to grips with. You're able to set four profiles across PS5, PS4 and PC for a total of 12. Within the app, you're able to fully customize your button layout, assign alternative inputs for those rear buttons, adjust analog stick deadzones and trigger travel length.\nA couple of cool extras include the ability to swap the color of the ring light - found around the right analog stick - with options for single, multiple and prism effects. Lastly, there's even an equalizer, allowing you to adjust headset audio balance to suit your liking on a per-profile basis.\nThe Revolution 5 Pro controller has notable flaws, some of which are admittedly out of Nacon\u2019s control. But, if you can get used to the slightly sensitive rear buttons and don\u2019t mind the loss of the DualSense\u2019s bespoke features, then the Revolution 5 Pro will serve you well as a feature-rich premium controller.\nShould I buy the Revolution 5 Pro?\nBuy it if...\nYou\u2019re after a feature-rich pro controller: The Revolution 5 Pro impresses with swappable modules and thoughtfully-implemented on-board headset settings.\nYou want a controller that\u2019ll last you years: Thanks to its sturdy build and Hall effect thumbsticks, the Revolution 5 Pro is designed to last a console generation.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou want to enjoy Sony\u2019s bespoke features: Consider the DualSense Edge if you\u2019d prefer to have features like haptic feedback and PS5-supported vibration.\nHow we reviewed the Revolution 5 Pro\nI tested the Revolution 5 Pro over the course of a week across PS5 and PC with a variety of multiplayer-focused titles including Street Fighter 6, Guilty Gear Strive, Fortnite, Fall Guys, and Final Fantasy 14 Online. I also made sure to try out all additional modules to really get a feel for the controller\u2019s customization.\nLooking for gamepad alternatives on other consoles?

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nAside from its middling battery life, the DualSense is an absolute joy to use \u2013 and we can\u2019t wait to see how haptic feedback and adaptive triggers impact future PlayStation 5 games to come.\nPros\n- +\nHaptic feedback and adaptive triggers are a revelation\n- +\nSturdy and comfortable to grip\n- +\nBuilt-in mic is a clever addition\n- +\nEye-catching design\nCons\n- -\nBattery life could be better\n- -\nMic quality is passable, but no headset replacement\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nDualSense Wireless Controller: one-minute review\nThe DualSense is one of the best controllers Sony has ever put its name on, providing players with an even better immersive experience with the console through some superb features missed in previous generations. Even now, with the launch of the DualSense Edge, the standard variation of the controller remains one of the strongest yet.\nA pleasingly sturdier beast than its predecessor, the DualSense outshines the PS4\u2019s DualShock 4 in every conceivable way, finally giving PlayStation owners a controller that rivals Xbox\u2019s offerings. It would, of course, be remiss to talk about the PS5 controller without mentioning its killer app \u2013 the haptic feedback.\nCreated by the company behind Nintendo\u2019s Joycon HD Rumble, DualSense\u2019s haptic feedback utilizes incredibly precise vibrations to help simulate on-screen happenings by sending intricate reverberations jolting across your hands. From the trickle of water droplets gently pitter-pattering across your palms to the new adaptive triggers\u2019 tangible resistance as you pull back a bowstring, the aptly named DualSense enhances immersion in a pleasingly tactile way.\nThat said, it's no longer Sony's only official PS5 controller option. The DualSense Edge offered decent competition in comparison to its standard model, taking the beacon as Sony's pro gamepad, and while it's comparable to the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller and Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2, the DualSense Edge provides some premium features you won't find on the regular option.\nEither way, it\u2019s hard to overstate the importance of Sony\u2019s new immersive tech, really, and while the packed-in Astro\u2019s Playroom software goes some way to demonstrating its potential, we have no doubt that PS5\u2019s launch games only scratch the surface of what haptic feedback will bring to the table. In an age where most controllers offer iteration rather than innovation, Sony\u2019s DualSense is the rarest of input devices - one that feels genuinely exciting.\nDualSense Wireless Controller: price and availability\n- DualSense Wireless Controller price: $74.99 / \u00a364.99 / AU$109.95\n- Available in eight different colors\nThe PS5 DualSense controller is $74.99 / \u00a364.99 as of the most recent DualSense price increase, but as you\u2019d expect, every PlayStation 5 comes with a controller in the box.\nIf, however, you want to indulge in some local co-op (or need to buy a replacement) you can always nab yourself an extra DualSense. While the PS5 has seen stock issues worldwide since launch \u2014 which appear to be easing up in recent times \u2014 thankfully the DualSense seems to be largely available in both the US, UK, and Australia.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAlongside the original White variant, we\u2019ve seen the space-themed Midnight Black, Cosmic Red, Nova Pink, Starlight Blue, and Galactic Purple. There\u2019s also Grey Camoflague and a God of War Ragnarok inspired design, which we\u2019ve detailed below.\nDualSense Wireless Controller: design\n- Comfiest PlayStation controller yet\n- Textured handles make for sturdy grip\n- Satisfying heft makes it feel premium\nAt first glance, PS5 controller looks like little more than a slightly futuristic redesign of the DualShock 4.\nAbandoning the PS4\u2019s all-black grungey aesthetic in favor of a slick white body accented by matte black analog sticks, the DualSense is a surprisingly attractive controller in the flesh. While it has a new PlayStation-symbol-embossed home button and the aforementioned built-in mic (along with a handy mute button), aside from the swapped share and start buttons, you\u2019d be mistaken for thinking this was just a bigger version of what came before.\nYet look a little closer and every aspect of the DualShock 4\u2019s chassis has been elongated. This time around Sony has put most of the controller\u2019s length into its grips, resulting in thicker and longer handles \u2013 and the result is the comfiest PS controller yet. Speaking of the grip, these elongated handles are now textured, too, feeling pleasingly tactile as they rest against your fingers.\nThis newly textured grip also means that your controller will stay firm - even if you happen to get into a particularly sweat-inducing multiplayer session. In a fan-pleasing touch, if you look closely at these little textured symbols that make up the DualSense\u2019s grip, you\u2019ll discover that each side is made up of a tiny collection of the PS face button symbols.\nWhat\u2019s a controller without its buttons? While the DualShock\u2019s buttons were serviceable, the buttons on the DualSense have been vastly improved from Sony\u2019s last-gen offering. Sporting a sleek glass-esque aesthetic, these clear plastic face buttons feel far firmer to the press than the DualShock 4. It may sound like a fairly minor improvement, but it all adds up to an impressive whole - a controller that feels sturdy and durable.\nThis feels even more important considering that the biggest gripe players had with the DualShock 4 was with its flimsy analog sticks. The first iteration of these controllers quickly saw the felt nubs wear away, leaving many gamers with peeling, worn down analog sticks only months later. Sony has sensibly opted to go with a concave design for its sticks, aping the far improved analog sticks included with the DualShock 4 controller. So far, they feel far sturdier.\nAt launch, the DualSense was only available in white, and the DualSense looking pretty sleek in its current two-tone configuration. Since then, Sony's colorful blue, pink and purple PS5 controllers have launched, alongside a midnight black variant, special edition God of War Ragnarok DualSense Controller, and more.\nFrom its textured handles to its satisfying heft, the DualSense feels like a controller designed to make long gaming sessions as comfortable and immersive as possible.\nDualSense Wireless Controller: performance\n- Haptic feedback and adaptive triggers are immersive innovations\n- Battery life is a bit disappointing\n- Built-in microphone\nAs we mentioned above, the haptic feedback is the real star of the show here. What\u2019s impressive about the tech is that somehow, haptic feedback reverberates throughout the entire controller, and the adaptive triggers are already being used in some pleasingly different ways. From colorful adventure Bugsnax transforming the right trigger into an authentically rigid camera-shutter to the quiet thud of sand reverberating convincingly around the controller during Astro Playroom\u2019s \u2018Bot Beach\u2019 level, this impressive tech genuinely feels exciting.\nImmersive innovations aside, the DualSense feels like a controller built for convenience. Not only is it far more comfortable than the DualShock 4, Sony\u2019s PS5 offering even has a built-in microphone, a pleasingly solid D-pad and no longer ruins your game with a glare-emitting light. While the touchpad and headphone jack return almost untouched from last-gen, the Micro USB charging cable has unsurprisingly been swapped out for a more modern USB C port.\nThe only downside with PlayStation\u2019s next-gen offering is how long you\u2019ll be able to use the DualSense. While not abysmal, the battery life is slightly disappointing, with Sony\u2019s PS5 controller only providing around nine to 10 hours of play before you\u2019ll need to pop in the charging cable. When compared to the staggering 30 hours you get from Nintendo\u2019s brilliant Switch Pro Controller, 10 hours doesn\u2019t feel like a great achievement.\nShould you buy the DualSense Wireless Controller?\nBuy it if...\nYou want a sturdy, feature-complete and comfortable controller that offers something genuinely innovative\nThe DualSense is a revelation and believe us when we say it needs to be experienced to be believed.\nYou need a second controller for any local co-op compatible PS5 games\nThis is a given, but if you're looking for an extra PS5 controller then the DualSense is the most affordable, reliable option - making it a no brainer.\nYou want a rechargeable controller\nThe PS5 controller is fortunately rechargeable, just don't expect the battery life to last more than around 10 hours.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou want a controller that works flawlessly across multiple devices\nThe DualSense works brilliantly on PS5, PC and natively on PS3 (weirdly), but not PS4 - and currently does not work on Mac."

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Razer Wolverine V3 Pro may still be my favorite premium Xbox and PC controller, but Nacon\u2019s Revolution X Unlimited comes very close to dethroning it and offers its own features worth considering over Razer\u2019s pad. The built-in screen isn\u2019t usually a feature I desire, but I found it to be genuinely helpful and intuitive on the Revolution X Unlimited. Swappable extras and an included charging dock sweeten the deal, though the controller\u2019s girth and plasticky build are a slight downer.\nPros\n- +\nBuilt-in display is intuitive\n- +\nSwappable sticks, D-pad, and weights are welcome extras\n- +\nComes with a charging dock\n- +\nIncredibly smooth Hall effect sticks\nCons\n- -\nNot suitable for smaller hands\n- -\nMiddling battery life\n- -\nOverly plasticky build\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nNacon Revolution X Unlimited controller: one-minute review\nThe Nacon Revolution X Unlimited is the latest premium Xbox controller from the gaming brand, and I think it\u2019s the company\u2019s best effort yet. Essentially an upgrade over the PS5-compatible Revolution 5 Pro (though sadly, there\u2019s no PlayStation compatibility to be had with this new gamepad), the Unlimited offers a similar experience with some notable new features.\nYour eyes will immediately be drawn to the Unlimited\u2019s built-in LCD display. Typically, I\u2019m not a fan of these on gamepads, as I feel they can often overcomplicate the play experience. On the Unlimited, though, the display is very intuitive. It trims the fat, strictly offering options for button mapping, connected gaming headsets, wireless pairing, and battery saving. As such, I find this to be a direct upgrade over the Revolution 5 Pro.\nThe Revolution X Unlimited does pack a premium price tag, but to sweeten the deal, Nacon has included a selection of swappable parts as well as a charging dock for quick and easy battery top-up. Throw in a pair of sublimely smooth Hall effect thumbsticks, tactile micro-switch face buttons, trigger locks, and a set of four remappable buttons, and you have a premium suite that\u2019s worth the investment.\nThere are, sadly, some drawbacks that keep it outside of contention for the premium spot in our best Xbox controllers and best PC controllers guides. For one, it\u2019s quite a bulky controller, and an over-reliance on plastic means that build quality isn\u2019t quite what you\u2019d expect from a luxury pad.\nBut overall, if you\u2019re in the market for a high-end Xbox controller or PC controller with tons of features and intuitive on-the-fly customization for your favorite games, I still highly recommend considering the Revolution X Unlimited.\nNacon Revolution X Unlimited controller review: Price and availability\nAs a premium pad, the Revolution X Unlimited commands a price tag of $199.99 / \u00a3179.99. You can purchase one for yourself at Nacon\u2019s own website as well as Amazon in the US and Argos in the UK. This is similar to the Revolution 5 Pro which retails at $199.99 / \u00a3199.99, albeit the X Unlimited is \u00a320 cheaper in the UK.\nThat price puts the Unlimited in the ballpark of other premium Xbox controllers such as the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro ($199.99 / \u00a3179.99), the Thrustmaster eSwap X2 ($169.99 / \u00a3149.99), and the official Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 ($179.99 / \u00a3159.99).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAll offer similar feature sets, including swappable stick and button modules, remappable keys, and controller layout profile creation.\nI think the Revolution X Unlimited has the edge over the eSwap X2 and Elite Series 2, thanks to its inclusion of Hall effect sticks (they\u2019re sold separately for Thrustmaster\u2019s pad) and that built-in display that I found genuinely useful here. However, I do prefer the near-perfect build quality offered by the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro.\nNacon Revolution X Unlimited controller review: specs\nPrice | $199.99 / \u00a3179.99 |\nDimensions | 6.5 x 4.5 x 2.2in / 164 x 115 x 56mm |\nWeight | 11.53oz / 327g |\nCompatibility | Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC |\nConnection type | Wireless (2.4Ghz, Bluetooth), Wired (USB-C) |\nBattery life | Around 10 hours |\nNacon Revolution X Unlimited controller: design and features\nAside from the controller itself, you\u2019re getting quite a lot of goodies in the Revolution X Unlimited box. The pad is housed in a tidy carry case, where you\u2019ll also find a charging dock, 2.4GHz USB dongle for wireless connectivity, a 3m USB-C cable, a thin dust cloth, and a small box that stores swappable accessories.\nSaid accessories include two D-pads (a four-way and an eight-way with the latter on the controller by default), six thumbstick caps (two concave, four convex of varying sizes), two metal stick rings for placing around the thumbsticks, and a set of six weights (two 0.35oz / 10g, two 0.49oz / 14g, and two 0.56oz / 16g) which can be slotted into the controller\u2019s grips for some additional heft if you need the pad to rest in your hands a little more firmly.\nThe Unlimited itself has that recognizable Xbox Wireless Controller-esque silhouette, but it is ever so slightly wider and taller than Microsoft\u2019s gamepad. This results in the Unlimited being better suited to players with larger hands.\nMeanwhile, overall build quality certainly isn\u2019t terrible, but I\u2019ve never been a fan of the use of cheap-feeling plastic on Nacon\u2019s controllers that\u2019s also present here. I did get used to it, but it definitely feels less robust in the hands than my go-to Razer Wolverine V3 Pro.\nThe standout feature this time is undoubtedly the built-in LCD display. As mentioned, I\u2019m typically not keen to see these on controllers like the Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra or the Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot. They\u2019re usually quite sluggish and aren\u2019t particularly intuitive in a pinch.\nNacon has nailed it here, though. A quick press of a button found next to the left bumper activates the display\u2019s menu. The UI is incredibly responsive and limits options to the essentials: audio for gaming headsets (including volume, mic monitoring, and a game/chat mixer), button mapping, and wireless pairing options.\nNacon Revolution X Unlimited controller: performance\nI\u2019m seriously impressed with the Revolution X Unlimited when it comes to overall gaming performance and play experience. I\u2019m glad that Nacon has opted for Hall effect sticks here, of course, but the sticks themselves are some of the smoothest in the business. If you\u2019ve read my Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller impressions, it\u2019s a similar story to that, where the sticks feel hyper-tuned for accuracy and responsiveness. Certainly, it\u2019ll be a boon for the best FPS games where carefully-placed shots mean everything.\nMicro-switch buttons are becoming increasingly common with contemporary gamepads, with even cheaper models like the GameSir T4 Kaleid offering them. They\u2019re also present on the Revolution X Unlimited, and they\u2019re satisfyingly tactile.\nThis is another element that positions the Unlimited as a competitive-focused controller. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s wonderful for any kind of game, and I had a blast testing it with The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered on Xbox Series X as well as A Hat in Time and Final Fantasy 14 Online on PC. But it really comes alive with multiplayer-oriented games like Tekken 8 and Fortnite, thanks to those buttery smooth thumbsticks and rapid button actuation.\nBattery life is a slight letdown as you\u2019re only getting around 10 hours on a full charge.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller is a must-have gamepad for the new console. Much like the original, it provides an astronomically more comfortable gaming experience than the pack-in Joy-Con 2 controllers, and rivals some of the best in the business when it comes to overall feel, build quality, performance, and - of course - battery life, which continues to be best-in-class for any console.\nPros\n- +\nLuxurious build quality\n- +\nUnbelievably smooth thumbsticks\n- +\nRemappable buttons are a welcome addition\n- +\nSimply refuses to run out of battery\n- +\nNFC and gyro support\nCons\n- -\nIt\u2019s not compatible with PC (yet)\n- -\nNo analog trigger option\n- -\nIt\u2019s not Hall effect\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nNintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller: one-minute review\nThe Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller launched alongside the console itself, and I\u2019ve been using it as my go-to Switch 2 gamepad since launch day. While I was already impressed with it at a Switch 2 hands-on preview event a few months back, actually having it at home has solidified it as perhaps my favorite controller of the year.\nThe mission statement is a simple one: provide an updated version of the excellent Nintendo Switch Pro Controller - easily one of the best Nintendo Switch controllers for that original console - while keeping the things players loved about that original model intact. I feel this has mostly been achieved with the Switch 2 Pro Controller.\nIt\u2019s incredibly comfortable in the hands, sporting simply lovely build quality from chassis to buttons. The thumbsticks are ultra-smooth and responsive, and additions like two remappable buttons on the rear, as well as a headphone jack, are extremely welcome.\nFurthermore, the original Pro Controller is remembered fondly for its frankly absurd battery life, lasting around 40 hours on a single charge. I\u2019m happy to report that\u2019s also the case with the Switch 2 Pro Controller; after three weeks of testing for a few hours most days, I\u2019ve only just seen the low battery warning flash up on my screen.\nSo what\u2019s holding it back from truly being the greatest of all time? Well, unlike the original Pro Controller, this new model isn\u2019t currently compatible with PC. It\u2019s likely we\u2019ll need to wait for a Steam compatibility update, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this happens in the near future. I also would\u2019ve loved a trigger lock feature, allowing players to switch between digital and analog sensitivities to suit a wider range of genres (analog triggers naturally work better for racing games, for example).\nLastly, Nintendo seemingly remains committed to not having Hall effect thumbsticks, which is a massive shame. What this means is that, eventually, I expect the Switch 2 Pro Controller to develop stick drift. Perhaps not as quickly as the Joy-Con 2 - of which there are already reports of users experiencing drift - but for a controller that costs as much as it does, the lack of sturdier Hall effect thumbsticks hurts. Doubly so, considering the sticks themselves feel fantastic during play.\nNintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller review: price and availability\n- $84.99 / \u00a374.99 / AU$119.95\n- Cheaper on average than a set of Joy-Con 2 ($94.99 / \u00a374.99 / AU$139.95)\n- A price increase in the US bumped it up from the originally planned $79.99\nIf there\u2019s one potential criticism I can levy at the Switch 2 Pro Controller, it\u2019s that it certainly isn\u2019t cheap.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIt\u2019s available to purchase now from Nintendo\u2019s own website as well as stocking retailers for $84.99 / \u00a374.99 / AU$119.95. US folks have it slightly worse here due to a price increase that\u2019s seen the controller\u2019s RRP pushed up from the original $79.99.\nOverall, though, the Switch 2 Pro Controller is cheaper in the US than a pair of Joy-Con 2 controllers ($94.99), while being priced the same as those in the UK (\u00a374.99).\nThat said, cheaper alternatives do exist in controllers like the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 ($69.99 / \u00a359.99 - around AU$90). This is an exceptional controller that\u2019s well worth looking into, especially as it\u2019s recently received a firmware update to allow for Switch 2 connectivity.\nNintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller review: Specs\nPrice | $84.99 / \u00a374.99 / AU$119.95 |\nWeight | 8.3oz / 235g |\nDimensions | 5.8 x 4.1 x 2.4in / 148 x 105 x 60mm |\nCompatibility | Nintendo Switch 2 |\nConnection type | Wireless (Bluetooth), Wired (USB Type-C) |\nBattery life | Around 40 hours |\nNintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller review: design and features\n- Pleasing light gray-on-black aesthetic design\n- Adds GameChat and GL/GR buttons, as well as a headphone jack\n- Otherwise, very similar to the original Pro Controller\nPut the Switch 2 Pro Controller side by side with the original model, and you\u2019ll notice a lot of similarities. Its large face buttons are about the same size here, the d-pad is very similar, and the controller still uses digital triggers. I think an option for quicker triggers would\u2019ve been nice here, via trigger locks, for genres like racing games. But there are some other upgrades here that I\u2019m very happy about.\nThe Switch 2 Pro Controller adds some very welcome features. There\u2019s a dedicated GameChat button like we see on the Joy-Con 2 for accessing the console\u2019s bespoke voice chat system. Additionally, you\u2019re getting a 3.5mm headphone jack, which - alarmingly - wasn\u2019t present on the original Pro Controller. Lastly, a pair of GL/GR buttons on the rear of the pad can be remapped on a per-game basis, though I\u2019ll touch more on those in the following performance section.\nIn terms of looks, the Switch 2 Pro Controller is simple, but pretty eye-catching. The semi-translucent look of the original has been replaced with a matte black shell. Meanwhile, the top that houses the bumpers and triggers - as well as the thumbstick shafts - have taken on a light gray coating that I think looks nice juxtaposed against the otherwise all-black gamepad. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s winning any awards in the aesthetics department, but it\u2019s a simple and elegant design that doesn\u2019t look out of place.\nOtherwise, there isn\u2019t much to report on the design front beyond the fact that this is an incredibly comfortable asymmetrical controller that sits firmly in the hands. I find that the Switch 2 Pro Controller\u2019s grips are of a perfect size, and the pad fits snugly in my hands with my index fingers set firmly on the triggers. I felt this way about the original Pro Controller, too, but its successor does feel ever so slightly more refined in this regard.\nNintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller review: Performance\n- Thumbsticks feel excellent during gameplay\n- A frankly absurd amount of battery life\n- GL/GR buttons are actually a godsend\nRight away, let\u2019s talk about the thing that most people fondly remember the original Pro Controller for - its seemingly endless battery life. While there have been no noticeable improvements here with the Switch 2 Pro Controller, I can\u2019t exactly say that\u2019s a bad thing.\nYep, you can expect this new model to go the distance with around 40-45 hours of battery life. Since launch, on average, I\u2019ve played my Switch 2 with the Pro Controller for around 1-3 hours daily.\nThree weeks later, I have only just seen the low battery warning flash up on my screen. This is absolutely best-in-class battery life that leaves even the best Nintendo Switch controllers in the dust. It is worth noting that such a hefty battery does take some time to charge up again - around 3-4 hours to be exact - but do this overnight via USB-C and you\u2019ll never need to worry about running out of juice.\nOtherwise, the Switch 2 Pro Controller is just a joy to play games with. The thumbsticks are the real heroes here, feeling almost impossibly smooth and incredibly responsive during play.\nThis makes precise platformers like Super Mario 3D World + Bowser\u2019s Fury or white knuckle racers like F-Zero GX feel fantastic to play (even if the latter still benefits more from the wireless GameCube controller\u2019s button layout).\nMy one gripe here would be that the thumbsticks are not Hall effect, with Nintendo seemingly opting once again for more traditional potentiometers. It\u2019s a frustrating commitment that we also see from Sony and Microsoft in their first-party pads, and as a result, it\u2019s currently hard to gauge just how long the Switch 2 Pro Controller\u2019s sticks will last before developing drift. That said, the thumbsticks here do feel decidedly sturdier than those on the Joy-Con 2, so I do expect them to last a good deal longer.\nHowever, I think my favorite addition to the Switch 2 Pro Controller has to be the rear GL/GR buttons. We\u2019ve seen remappable buttons like these on countless third-party controllers, but I really like how Nintendo has implemented them. By holding down the Home button while in-game, you\u2019ll bring up a quick menu that lets you assign GL and GR as secondary inputs.\nThis works on a per-game basis, too, meaning you don\u2019t need to constantly reassign them while you\u2019re hopping from game to game. They can be an absolute lifesaver, too. In The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, for example, I bound the sprint and jump actions to these buttons, letting me still have access to camera controls.\nSimilarly, in Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition, binding the left and right d-pad inputs to GL/GR let me cycle through my inventory of items without having to stop moving or adopt an awkward claw grip instead.\nOtherwise, you can expect a controller that performs just as well as the original where it counts. Gyro aiming is still incredibly solid and accurate for games like Splatoon 3, and you still have near-field communication (NFC) support for scanning amiibo figures in your favorite games.\nShould I buy the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller?\nBuy it if...\nYou want a cheaper (and better) Joy-Con 2 alternative\nSure, you\u2019re not getting the Joy-Con 2\u2019s fancy directional rumble or their aptitude for co-op play. But given the lower US price point, higher comfort factor, and sublime thumbsticks and GL/GR buttons, the Pro Controller wins out for me.\nYou prefer wireless play\nYou\u2019re absolutely laughing here, as the Switch 2 Pro Controller seriously goes the distance in terms of battery life, putting in an impressive 40+ hours on an average full charge.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou\u2019re on a budget\nWhile I wholeheartedly recommend the Switch 2 Pro Controller at its price point, I can\u2019t say it\u2019s exactly cheap. There are more affordable options around $10-$20 cheaper that do a similar job, such as the excellent 8BitDo Ultimate 2, or indeed the original Pro Controller.\nYou\u2019ve had bad luck with stick drift\nWithout drift-resistant Hall effect sticks, I can\u2019t say for sure just how long the Switch 2 Pro Controller\u2019s thumbsticks will last before developing drift. If you\u2019ve fallen foul of stick drift in the past, you may want to consider some alternatives.\nNintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller review: Also consider\nIf the Switch 2 Pro Controller isn\u2019t exactly what you\u2019re after, there are a couple of great alternatives for you to consider.\n| Row 0 - Cell 0 | Switch 2 Pro Controller | 8BitDo Ultimate 2 | Switch Pro Controller |\nPrice | $84.99 / \u00a374.99 / AU$119.95 | $69.99 / \u00a359.99 / AU$90 (or $59.99 / \u00a349.99 for PC-only model) | $69.99 / \u00a359.99 / AU$99.95 |\nWeight | 8.3oz / 235g | 8.7oz / 246g | 8.7oz / 246g |\nDimensions | 5.8 x 4.1 x 2.4in / 148 x 105 x 60mm | 5.7 x 4.1 x 2.4in / 147 x 103 x 61mm | 5.9 x 4.2 x 2.4in / 152 x 106 x 60mm |\nCompatibility | Nintendo Switch 2 | PC, Android (Switch/Switch 2 version sold separately) | Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PC |\nConnection type | Bluetooth, USB Type-C | 2.4GHz, Bluetooth, USB Type-C | Bluetooth, USB Type-C |\nBattery life | Around 40 hours | 10-15 hours | Around 40 hours |\n8BitDo Ultimate 2\nA fantastic follow-up to my favorite Nintendo Switch controller, the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 takes everything that made the original so good - Hall effect sticks, superb build quality, included charging dock - and upgrades it. Battery life is sadly worse overall, but you honestly can\u2019t go wrong with either this or the original model.\nRead our full 8BitDo Ultimate 2 review\nNintendo Switch Pro Controller\nThe original Pro Controller is still a worthy purchase and compatible with Nintendo Switch 2. You may want to opt for this one if you\u2019re looking to save some cash, especially as it\u2019s still a top contender in the field of Switch accessories.\nRead our full Nintendo Switch Pro Controller review\nHow I tested the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller\n- Tested for three weeks, on average 1-3 hours per day\n- Compared to the original Pro Controller and similar third-party gamepads\n- Played a wide variety of games, both modern and retro\nI tested the Switch 2 Pro Controller from launch until now - a period of around three weeks. On average, I played with the controller for around one to three hours a day, largely opting for docked mode play on my LG CX OLED TV.\nIn my time with the controller, I put it through its paces with games across a wide variety of genres. This includes The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition, Mario Kart World, Street Fighter 6, F-Zero GX, Deltarune, and Super Mario 3D World + Bowser\u2019s Fury.\nI compared the Switch 2 Pro Controller\u2019s feature set to that of the original Pro Controller and third-party gamepads, including the GameSir Tarantula Pro and the original 8BitDo Ultimate. While I do wish Nintendo\u2019s pad brought Hall effect sticks to the table, its overall feature set and comfortable play experience still make it well worth considering in a crowded controller market.\nFirst reviewed June 2025\nRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for over four years.

      "text": "The Nacon Revolution X Unlimited vs Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot comparison might be an odd matchup in the realm of the best Xbox controllers at first glance, but the two share more similarities than simply having handy built-in displays.\nThe third-party controller market is better than it\u2019s ever been. Gone are the days of having to borrow your sibling\u2019s MadCatz gamepad for split-screen co-op in Halo 2. These days, manufacturers like 8BitDo, GameSir, and indeed Nacon and Turtle Beach are providing affordable, forward-thinking controllers that I often genuinely prefer using over first-party kits.\nThat\u2019s typically down to the usage of Hall effect or TMR thumbsticks, which aim to eliminate the stick drift problem that\u2019s plagued the likes of the DualSense and - more infamously - Nintendo\u2019s Joy-Con controllers. But beyond that, third-party manufacturers usually aren\u2019t afraid to offer extras in the box, or push the boat out with some genuinely neat innovations - even if they\u2019re not always perfect.\nCase in point: both the Revolution X Unlimited and the Turtle Beach Stealth Pivot offer something different that you won\u2019t often find even with the best PC controllers. The former\u2019s easy-to-use on-board display for controller and headset customization really shows how such an inclusion can benefit the player if done right. The latter, while also housing a display of its own, also has its namesake pivot system, letting you swap to alternative stick and button layouts without needing to remove anything from the controller itself.\nWhile neither gamepad is perfect - I certainly have a fair share of issues with each - they are nonetheless the most fascinating controllers I\u2019ve tested and reviewed in the last twelve months. Let\u2019s get into why.\nValue proposition\nIt is worth noting that neither controller is exactly cheap. The Revolution X Unlimited is considered a premium gamepad, costing $199.99 / \u00a3179.99. The Stealth Pivot comes in a good deal cheaper at $129.99 / \u00a3119.99. Though in both cases, I wouldn\u2019t exactly say they\u2019re controllers you\u2019d buy on a whim, given the price.\nWith the Revolution X Unlimited, you do get some neat extras for the trouble. These include a set of alternate thumbsticks and insertable grip weights. A charging dock is also included for quick and easy top-up when you need it. The Stealth Pivot doesn\u2019t come with any fancy extras like this, but it is much cheaper by default.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nI rated the Revolution X Unlimited four out of five stars in my review. I love its simple built-in display for quick customization, and the inclusion of Hall effect sticks is always welcome. Though I do lament Nacon\u2019s dedication to creating controllers with overly plasticky materials, as that does cheapen the experience a little, especially for a controller this pricey. Battery life also isn\u2019t the greatest in the world, but certainly serviceable enough.\nThe Stealth Pivot is one I had more mixed feelings about, and I awarded it three-and-a-half out of five stars in my review for that gamepad. I really like its pivot gimmick that lets you swap between control styles suited for modern and retro games. It also has an in-built screen, though I felt it was a touch unnecessary on this controller; the central pivot feature is strong enough on its own, and I think the screen only serves to push up the controller\u2019s price.\nThe standout features of each\nNevertheless, both controllers offer unique selling points that go beyond the typical pad. Nacon\u2019s controller has practically perfected the use of an in-built LCD screen. It offers easy-to-understand settings like audio and mic monitoring for gaming headsets, quick button mapping, and wireless pairing options.\nIt\u2019s straightforward and responsive, and activated via a dedicated button on top of the gamepad. I love it, and I hope other manufacturers wanting to include a screen on their devices follow the elegantly simple example set here.\nThe Stealth Pivot, as mentioned, offers a rather unique \u2018pivoting\u2019 feature on the controller itself. There\u2019s one on either side of the pad, and by default, the left houses a thumbstick and a d-pad, with the right side playing host to the right thumbstick and face buttons. These can be swapped simply by pushing each module in, rotating them, and locking them back into place.\nAfter swapping, the left side features a d-pad and two extra face buttons. The right has a six-button layout that I find excellent for the best fighting games. As a result, the Stealth Pivot is ideal for a wide variety of games, both new and old.\nIn both cases, I would love to see Nacon and Turtle Beach further hone these concepts in future controllers. For one, I\u2019d love a Revolution X Unlimited-like pad available at a cheaper price point. And on the Turtle Beach side, I think a version of the Stealth Pivot sans its built-in display could work wonders, and again, be available for less.\nIf you haven\u2019t heard of these gamepads before and are looking for strong Xbox Wireless Controller alternatives for either Xbox Series X and Series S or PC, I highly recommend you to check them out. I also expect both will be subject to decent discounts as we approach the end of the year.\nYou might also like...\n- Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is expected to launch just one year after its predecessor, and I\u2019m worried it\u2019ll repeat these three Modern Warfare 3 blunders\n- 'I could be in there for hours' \u2013 PlayStation legend Shuhei Yoshida on why Reach is your next must-play game on Meta Quest and PSVR 2\n- I've used the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller for two weeks now \u2013 here are five ways it's better than the original\nRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for over four years.

      "text": "It\u2019s been a whirlwind year for video games. Okay, I probably say that every year, but 2025 has seen some generational AAA releases, mobile gaming has been given a much-needed shot in the arm, and the indie scene keeps trucking along with the kinds of experiences you just won\u2019t get anywhere else.\nWe\u2019re not quite at year\u2019s end just yet, and there\u2019s plenty of upcoming games I\u2019m dying to get my hands on. But I figured I\u2019d take some time to pick out seven amazing titles I\u2019ve had a blast with throughout 2025.\nI genuinely believe there has been something for everyone in 2025. Whether you\u2019re into the best soulslikes, after arguably one of the best RPGs of all time, or you simply want to punch massive holes into things with a (quite literally) groundbreaking Switch 2 year-one title. Let\u2019s get into it.\nWuchang: Fallen Feathers\n- Superb level design\n- A thoughtful take on the soulslike subgenre\n- Good build variety and replay value\nI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d love Wuchang: Fallen Feathers nearly as much as I did. Soulslike formula applied to a historical setting with demons thrown in for good measure? It\u2019s a movie we\u2019ve seen quite a few times before.\nWuchang, however, largely manages to curb derivativeness through sheer quality. It has some of the strongest soulslike level design I\u2019ve seen outside of the FromSoftware catalog, and I love its freeform approach to character builds. If your current loadout isn\u2019t working for you against a particular area or boss, you\u2019re free to respec your skill points for free at any time.\nIt\u2019s a visually striking game, too, with plenty of environmental variety and some stunning vistas to behold. Throw in some excellent boss fights, a wonderful soundtrack, and plenty of atmosphere, and we have a soulslike in Wuchang that I believe will stand the test of time.\nClair Obscur: Expedition 33\n- A story that\u2019s up there with genre legends\n- Incredible battle system\n- One stunner of a soundtrack\nI don\u2019t know if I can say much about Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 that hasn\u2019t already been said. It\u2019s 2025\u2019s critical darling, achieving widespread popularity largely through word-of-mouth, and there are very, very good reasons for that.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nExpedition 33 manages to carve its own place in the turn-based RPG pantheon not just through its uniquely bleak setting, but also its battle system. By employing more action-focused elements like reactive defending, parrying, and jumping to respond to enemy attacks, battles remain unpredictable and tense affairs throughout the game.\nFor a relatively small development team\u2019s first major outing, Expedition 33 is an incredible achievement. Its heart-wrenching tale of constantly pushing through grief and loss is one that demands you see it through to the end, and it\u2019s one I won\u2019t forget any time soon.\nDonkey Kong Bananza\n- Return to monke\n- Best punching in gaming history?\n- Endlessly creative, explorable worlds\nSometimes you just want to punch things. Donkey Kong Bananza might just be the perfect \u2018I\u2019ve had a horrible day at work\u2019 game, because its focus on battering the ever-loving snot out of its enemies and environments seems specifically tailored to getting the dopamine flowing.\nLike Super Mario Odyssey before it, Bananza manages to be agonizingly difficult to put down. It\u2019s a game that\u2019s more than happy to set you loose in giant maps, tearing literal chunks out of them in order to beat platforming challenges and find no shortage of hidden secrets.\nIt\u2019s the best platformer I\u2019ve played in years; not since A Hat In Time have I been so eager to just drop everything to explore its world, sometimes not even with a goal in mind. Bananza has an excellent and lengthy campaign, of course, but stopping to punch the roses really is all the incentive I need to jump back in.\nDynasty Warriors Origins\n- The musou formula at its most satisfying\n- Fantastic music, obviously\n- An intoxicating power fantasy unlike any other\nI\u2019m being a little biased here, because I\u2019m a huge fan of the Dynasty Warriors series. That said, Omega Force\u2019s \u20181-vs-1,000\u2019 action games (outside of the excellent Hyrule Warriors) have started to feel pretty stale over the past few years. So much so that it was refreshing to see the developer tackle different kinds of games, including the very underrated Wild Hearts.\nI do have my issues with Dynasty Warriors Origins. The sole protagonist is unbelievably boring, and the game is sorely missing the silly charm of its predecessors. The limited nature in which you can play as other legendary officers also really hurts the game.\nBut when Origins is good, it soars. It puts forward the best-feeling combat the series has ever had. The power of current-gen consoles, paired with new mechanics like grand tactics and ambush charges, makes you feel like you\u2019re truly taking part in epic historical battles.\nIt\u2019s definitely got the sauce, with lavishly flamboyant weapon move sets and a belting rock soundtrack. But if Omega Force is going to stick with this revised formula in the future, I\u2019d at the very least love to see a character creator (a baffling omission here, considering it\u2019s become a bit of a Koei Tecmo staple) and fully playable officers from the Three Kingdoms.\nUmamusume: Pretty Derby\n- Spawned a fandom overnight\n- Packed with charm and personality\n- Races are unbelievably hype\nWhile I do enjoy me some Honkai: Star Rail, I typically make it a point to avoid mobile games. Free-to-play at surface level, the way in which these games can sneakily pry open your wallet is well-documented.\nColor me surprised, then, when the Western release of Umamusume: Pretty Derby ended up offering a highly enjoyable experience that I never once felt like I needed to augment with my bank details. Umamusume instead puts forward a very straightforward gameplay loop, having you choose your favorite Uma to start a career playthrough with, training their stats for big race events.\nSaid races are where Umamusume really comes alive. There\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ve seen one or two viral clips of players absolutely losing their minds as their Haru Urara clutches her first win over a charging Daiwa Scarlet.\nUmamusume is a gacha game at the end of the day, so there is always the temptation to drop cash into it to earn limited characters and support cards. Thankfully, developer Cygames has a track record of uncharacteristic generosity with its mobile games, and you\u2019ll often find yourself swamped in currency for pulls without having to pay a dime.\nElden Ring Nightreign\n- A blisteringly fast take on FromSoftware combat and exploration\n- No two runs are ever quite the same\n- Some of the best bosses in From\u2019s catalog\nAs much as I love 2022\u2019s Elden Ring, I think I might like Elden Ring Nightreign just a little bit more.\nIts lightning-quick pace is a surprisingly great fit for this shadowy alternate version of The Lands Between. OG Elden Ring is a relatively slow, carefully-paced experience. Nightreign is that experience if you were first blindfolded, spun around ten times, and had rockets strapped to your shoes.\nThe game has received plenty of post-launch support, most of which has been met with positivity. It now supports duos mode for two-player-only matches, and a steady rotation of souped-up boss fights via the Everdark Sovereign system keeps things fresh for hardened Souls vets.\nNaturally, Nightreign would fall apart if its bosses weren\u2019t up to snuff. Thankfully, it has what I believe to be some of the finest boss fights in FromSoftware\u2019s history. While there are a couple that are irksome to no end, fights against the madness-inducing Libra and the towering ice dragon Caligo are awe-inspiring, with some stunning music backing them up.\nIt's a scrappy, relentlessly thrilling multiplayer title that\u2019s perfect for two or three friends. Solo play has also been improved since launch, but you\u2019ll definitely get the most out of it with a pair of pals for some good old-fashioned jolly co-operation.\nTokyo Xtreme Racer\n- Refreshingly arcade-like racing\n- Licensed cars from the golden age of Japanese street racing\n- Tons of personality, with each racer having their own little story\nGenki\u2019s Tokyo Xtreme Racer series is unfortunately one that I\u2019ve let pass me by, despite being a huge fan of arcade racers. I fixed this for myself when the early access version of the latest Tokyo Xtreme Racer hit Steam, and I\u2019ve had a blast with it.\nSet across the night-soaked highways of Tokyo, you play as a street racer aiming to climb the ranks to become a local legend. It\u2019s racing in perhaps its purest form. You\u2019ll drive along the various highways, free-roam style, until you come across another racer you\u2019ve yet to challenge. A quick flash of your lights while behind them will initiate a street race battle. Your goal? Simply put, enough distance between you and your rival within a certain amount of time.\nIt\u2019s simple, but blazingly fast fun, helped by a strong selection of licensed Japanese vehicles from Nissan, Subaru, Mazda, and more. You\u2019ll also get to experience a slick Eurobeat soundtrack and plenty of story beats from a wide range of fun, interesting characters. Yep, there\u2019s a story here, too.\nThe full version of Tokyo Xtreme Racer currently doesn\u2019t have a release date, and it\u2019s unknown whether it\u2019ll land on consoles or not. Right now, though, the early access release offers roughly half of the game\u2019s planned content, so there\u2019s a good 15-20 hours of gameplay to check out right now.\nYou might also like...\n- Old School RuneScape has officially taken over my life, and I deeply regret not trying it out sooner\n- I'm a Legend of Zelda superfan \u2013 can you beat my ultimate Zelda trivia quiz?\n- I\u2019ve played the first chapter of Ninja Gaiden 4, and it\u2019s hitting all the right notes with blood-soaked combat and punishing difficulty\nRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for over four years.

      "text": "The best Nintendo Switch controllers 2025\nTop Switch gamepads from 8BitDo, CRKD and more\nThe best Nintendo Switch controllers come highly recommend from us especially if you want a more comfortable experience than what the pack-in Joy-Con controllers provide.\nThe Nintendo Switch is lurching towards eight whole years on the market, more options than ever before have opened up for both budget and premium controller choices. So much so that third-party options have outflanked and outclassed Nintendo's official Switch controllers. With that in mind, we're covering both wireless and wired models here across the price spectrum so you'll find something in our list that's well-suited to your preferences.\nA commonality with the best Nintendo Switch controllers is that they're largely more affordable than the best PS5 controllers and the best PC controllers. Pricier, premium options do exist, but manufacturers like 8BitDo, PowerA and CRKD typically offer top quality controllers that are much easier on the wallet. These gamepads still pack a host of high-grade features and better yet, most offer Bluetooth connectivity for ease of responsive wireless play.\nAt TechRadar Gaming, we've thoroughly tested and reviewed each and every Nintendo Switch controller on this list. That means you can rest assured that our recommendations are backed up by weeks of testing for each individual product - not to mention years of hardware knowledge to help inform your purchasing decisions.\nThe Quick List\nBest overall\nBest overall\nThe 8BitDo Ultimate is unmatched in the realm of Nintendo Switch controllers. Featuring a gorgeous build, quality buttons and sticks and a fair price, it's an essential purchase.\nBest official\nBest official\nNintendo's official Pro controller is a fantastic upgrade over the Joy-Con controllers, with its best feature being its frankly absurd amount of battery life, and quick-charge functionality.\nBest budget\nBest budget\nIt may be a pared down version of the standard Ultimate, but this Bluetooth model shines with superb build quality and a pair of excellent-feeling digital triggers.\nBest handheld\nBest handheld\nThe Nitro Deck is essential if you primarily play your Nintendo Switch in portable mode. Featuring excellent build quality and a wealth of great features, it's simply phenomenal.\nBest pro features\nBest pro features\nWith pleasant RGB, nine remappable buttons and a handy face button quick-switch, the GameSir Tarantula Pro packs an impressive feature set at an affordable price.\nBest for multiplayer\nBest for multiplayer\nWhile certainly not of the highest quality, the Joy-Con controllers come packed in with the console itself, and can enable two players access to multiplayer.\nLoad the next product\nBest fight stick\nBest fight stick\nIf you regularly play fighting games on Nintendo Switch, consider purchasing the 8BitDo Arcade Stick for a more authentic and arcade-like experience.\nBest for retro gaming\nBest for retro gaming\nThe CRKD Atom is a small but mighty companion for Nintendo Switch Online's retro game libraries including NES, SNES and GBA.\nBest Nintendo Switch controllers in 2025\nThe best Nintendo Switch controller\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a high-quality, versatile controller: The 8BitDo Ultimate offers premium quality for less, and the inclusion of a charging dock only sweetens the deal.\n\u274c You're an amiibo enjoyer: Lacking NFC (near field communication) support, you won't be able to scan amiibo figures with this gamepad.\nIf you had to make a snap decision on which Nintendo Switch controller to buy, make it the 8BitDo Ultimate. Between the build quality, feel, battery life, and more it simply ticks almost all the boxes we\u2019d expect for what\u2019s one of the best controllers on the market, period. Throw in extra features like remappable button profiles via the 8BitDo app (including two extra buttons at the pad\u2019s rear) and you\u2019ve got a \u2018Pro\u2019 adjacent controller that\u2019s well worth the cash.\nThe price tag is even sweeter. At $69.99 / \u00a359.99, it matches the cost of our next entry on the list, and packs in even more features. The 8BitDo Ultimate\u2019s value rises even further when you consider that it comes with its own charging dock, too. Handy for when you need to charge in a pinch when the pad\u2019s 20 hours of battery life runs dry.\nThere\u2019s only a couple of shortcomings to speak of, namely a slightly crowded central area where you\u2019ll find buttons like Start, Select, Home and Share. This can make it easy to hit multiple buttons by mistake. There\u2019s also no NFC support, so you\u2019ll need to rely on the Switch\u2019s Joy-Con controllers if you\u2019re into collecting and scanning amiibo figures and cards. But ultimately these are mere nitpicks and don\u2019t spoil anything that this fantastic controller gets right.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\n- Read more: 8BitDo Ultimate controller review\nBest official Nintendo Switch controller\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want massive battery life: The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller goes the distance with approximately 40-50 hours of charge.\n\u274c You're sick of stick drift: Without hall-sensing sticks, the Pro Controller is still prone to stick drift after long-term use.\nIt\u2019s no great shock that the official Nintendo Switch Pro Controller is a contender for the best pad for the system. Despite being just slightly pipped by the 8BitDo Ultimate in our books, Nintendo\u2019s own is still an excellent controller worth considering. Especially if you like the sound of 40+ hours of battery life on a single charge. Yep, the Pro Controller\u2019s battery life might just be the best thing about it.\nAt $69.99 / \u00a359.99 the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller matches the price of our top entry on this list. And while the Pro Controller lacks some of its rival\u2019s features (no charging dock, rear buttons or support for multiple button profiles), it makes up for it in other areas such as full NFC support and \u2013 again \u2013 that staggering battery life.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a controller that\u2019s a bit more traditional (not to mention much sturdier) than the Switch\u2019s pack-in Joy-Con controllers, there\u2019s very little wrong with the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. While we do prefer the buttons and triggers on the 8BitDo Ultimate, the Pro is still an excellent choice especially if you play primarily in docked mode.\n- Read more: Nintendo Switch Pro Controller review\nThe best budget Nintendo Switch controller\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want 8BitDo quality for cheaper: Comparable to the 8BitDo Ultimate in terms of quality, the Ultimate C offers a slightly pared-down experience for less.\n\u274c You want that charging dock: With overall worse battery life than its more powerful counterpart, consider the 8BitDo Ultimate if you'd prefer the full package.\nYes, the 8BitDo Ultimate C Bluetooth controller may be a pared-down alternative to the standard Ultimate gamepad, but that doesn't mean it's any sort of slouch. This Nintendo Switch controller offers wireless Bluetooth connectivity, decent battery life, superb build quality and a pair of fantastic digital triggers that we actually prefer over the main version of the controller.\nBeing a budget option, it is worth noting that it's missing some core features of the 8BitDo Ultimate. 2.4GHz connectivity isn't present here, nor are remappable back buttons for secondary input support. There's no charging dock included with this model either, and its battery life clocks in at around 16 hours (about 6 hours less than the standard Ultimate).\nStill, it's certainly on the higher-end of quality when it comes to budget Nintendo Switch controllers. And you'll be hard-pressed to find a wireless option that's this cheap.\nThe best handheld Nintendo Switch controller\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're a portable player: The Nitro Deck offers the best portable Nintendo Switch experience out there.\n\u274c You primarily play on TV: If you don't take your Switch out and about, there's little use in purchasing the Nitro Deck over other top controllers.\nThe Nitro Deck is, as we referred to in our review, effectively the Swiss army knife of Nintendo Switch accessories. It's easily one of the best Nintendo Switch controllers in this list, and ideal for players who prefer gaming on the go.\nIt doesn't cost the world, either, with the base model coming in at just $59.99 / \u00a359.99. However, given its portable nature, you may wish to opt for the slightly pricier $89.99 / \u00a389.99 variant which features multiple choice of limited edition colorways and extras like a carry case.\nThe Nitro Deck simply feels excellent to play Nintendo Switch games with. Its sturdy build protects your unit from damage, and its smart Hall-effect sticks mean that it won't suffer from stick drift the same way many Nintendo Switch controllers do. It's an essential purchase, then, if you're looking for a portable way to play.\n- Read more: Nitro Deck review\nThe best Nintendo Switch controller with pro features\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a heap of features: Nine remappable buttins, trigger stops and Hall-sensing sticks? The Tarantula Pro is awash with Pro-level features.\n\u274c You want a more straightforward controller: If you're simply not interested in ancillary features on your controller, you'd be better off sticking with a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller.\nGameSir has done it yet again, offering an impressively forward-thinking controller at a very reasonable price point. The GameSir Tarantula Pro innovates with smart remappable button placement and a handy face button layout switcher, which can swap between Switch and Xbox layouts on the fly via a simple multifunction button macro.\nGameSir has opted for a symmetrical stick layout here, which you might prefer if you regularly use some of the best PS5 controllers like the DualSense. This also allows the controller to be slightly more compact than your average gamepad which typically use the Xbox Wireless Controller silhouette.\nIn terms of features, you're getting GameSir's own Hall-sensing TMR sticks, a whopping nine remappable buttons, trigger stops, the aforementioned quick-switch system for button layout and a handy multifunction button that lets you set macros, switch button profiles and more. It's a fully-fledged true Pro controller package and easily one of our favorite controllers in this list.\n- Read more: GameSir Tarantula Pro review\nThe best Nintendo Switch controller for local multiplayer\n6. Nintendo Switch Joy-Con controllers\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're in a household with multiple people: The Joy-Con controllers are excellent for easily accessible multiplayer sessions.\n\u274c You simply want better quality: These aren't the most durable controllers in the world and you may find yourself needing replacements sooner rather than later.\nThe Joy-Con controllers were a fresh, novel concept when the Nintendo Switch launched way back in 2017. And some of their more forward-thinking elements, such as the HD rumble (a similar type of haptics as seen in the DualSense) are still great to this day. Chiefly the fact that \u2013 if you can handle their small size \u2013 you\u2019re effectively getting two controllers for the price of one. This alone makes the Joy-Con excellent for local multiplayer games.\nBut that fact, along with the Joy-Con\u2019s novelty, makes them even pricier than the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. You\u2019ll be paying $79.99 / \u00a369.99 for a pair of Joy-Con controllers, making them even costlier than the top two entries on our list.\nThrow in that the Joy-Con controllers lack the firm build quality of the Pro Controller, and have analog sticks that are prone to a drifting defect, then you may be better off checking out some of the other options on our list. On the other hand, there\u2019s undeniable value in their versatility, and they\u2019re excellent for local multiplayer titles like Mario Party Superstars and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. This makes the Joy-Con controllers fun and family friendly.\nThe best Nintendo Switch fight stick\n7. 8BitDo Arcade Stick\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You love fighting games: There's plenty of fighting games available on Switch and they pair fantastically with this arcade stick.\n\u274c You want something less bulky: It's the largest controller on this list and if you don't play fighters, its use case is rather limited.\n8BitDo bookends our best Nintendo Switch controllers guide with its superb arcade stick \u2013 a prime choice if you\u2019re into downloading and playing the veritable wealth of fighting games available on the Nintendo eShop, from compilations like the Capcom Fighting Collection to SNK cult classics like Garou: Mark of the Wolves. It\u2019s not just one of the best Nintendo Switch controllers, though, as it also features in our guide to the best fight sticks.\nAt $90 / \u00a382, the 8BitDo Arcade Stick certainly is the priciest bit of kit on our list, but complements Nintendo\u2019s console well thanks to its gorgeous retro finish and 8BitDo\u2019s ever-reliable build quality. As well as fighting games, then, it\u2019s similarly wonderful for playing the litany of retro titles available via Nintendo Switch Online.\nThe 8BitDo arcade stick also puts forward high-quality buttons, button mapping and multi-profile support, and even wireless connectivity. You won\u2019t be bogged down by wires thanks to the stick\u2019s Bluetooth support, which also makes it work wonders in both docked and portable modes.\n- Read more: 8BitDo Arcade Stick review\nThe best Nintendo Switch controller for retro gaming\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a controller that doubles as an accessory: The CRKD Atom is a fully-functional controller that you can also hook to a bag or a keychain.\n\u274c You're not really playing retro games: With its lack of thumbsticks and tiny size, the Atom isn't best suited to modern AAA gaming.\nDon't be fooled by its diminutive size or the fact that it's also advertised as a bag or keychain accessory; the CRKD Atom is a fully-functional controller from the makers of the excellent Nitro Deck. While lacking thumbsticks and not exactly suited to longer gaming sessions, the Atom is fantastic for short burst of retro play.\nThat makes it an excellent fit for Nintendo Switch Online's variety of retro game libraries, including NES, SNES, Mega Drive / Genesis and Game Boy Advance. It connects to your Switch via Bluetooth and offers around 10 hours of battery life - that's pretty impressive given its small size.\nThe Atom also comes in a variety of fun colorways, all costing an eye-catchingly cheap $19.99 / \u00a319.99 / AU$33. So if you're after a neat little controller that's as portable as the console itself, we can't recommend the CRKD Atom enough, especially so at this stunningly low retail price.\n- Read more: CRKD Atom review\nBest Nintendo Switch controllers - FAQs\nWill Nintendo Switch controllers work on Switch 2?\nHonestly, this is an unknown at this point. Nintendo has yet to air its April 2 Switch 2 Direct presentation, after all. However, most wireless controllers on Switch connect via Bluetooth. If the Switch 2 opts for the same tech, then there's a very decent chance your original Switch controllers will work on the new console. For now, we'll just have to wait and see.\nIs a controller better than the Joy-Con?\nAlthough it predominantly depends on personal preference, we would say that a controller is generally more comfortable for longer gaming sessions in comparison to the Joy-Con controllers. The Joy-Con are novel when you first get your console, and they are great for multiplayer games and short bursts, but generally, the smaller form factor makes the controllers uncomfortable after a while. This is why we would recommend getting a controller just in case the Joy-Con don't fit the criteria anymore.\nWhich is better, the Joy-Con or the Pro Controller?\nAt TRG, we broadly have a personal preference for the Switch Pro Controller. That's largely down to its excellent build quality, comfy grip, and massive 40+ hour battery life.\nThe Joy-Con controllers don't really hold a candle to the Pro Controller in such cases. However, they're not entirely useless. Joy-Con provide easy access to local multiplayer gaming by essentially being two controllers in one. They're also great for younger players or those with smaller hands.\nIs there a difference between Switch and Switch OLED Joy-Con controllers?\nBesides color scheme, there are no differences at all between the Switch and Switch OLED Joy-Con controllers. While the OLED does have a larger display, its Joy-Con remain the same size and have an identical feature set. That goes for build quality, battery life, HD Rumble and NFC functionality. It's all the same on the OLED as it is the base Switch.\nCan I use a wireless controller with a Switch Lite?\nFortunately, wireless controllers can be connected to any member of the Nintendo Switch family, including the OLED and the Switch Lite. However, if you've ended up with a wired controller you won't be able to use it with a Switch Lite. We find wireless controllers more convenient with the Nintendo Switch family anyway.\nRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for over four years.

      "text": "The best Xbox controllers in 2025\nTop Xbox gamepads from Razer, Turtle Beach and more\nThe best Xbox controllers can reliably take your gaming experience up a notch, offering great build quality and enhancements like Hall effect sticks or digital trigger locks. Just like the best PC controllers, the number of stellar Xbox pads increases year on year and in 2025 there's plenty of quality options all across the budget spectrum. I recommend keeping an eye on next week's Prime Day deals, too, as there are bound to be tons of discounts on gamepads featured in this list.\nOur curated guide to the best Xbox controllers is primarily aimed at the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles - and all bear the official 'Designed for Xbox' seal of approval.

We've carefully considered everything from comfort to cost, aiming to recommend top quality products that are typically much easier on the wallet than many of the best PS5 controllers.\nAs a lifelong gamer and someone who's been writing professionally about gaming hardware for almost half a decade, controllers are my bread and butter. From the Sega Dreamcast to the Xbox Series X, I've always had an appreciation for controller design and ergonomics, as well as the unique features they bring to the table.\nIn terms of today's Xbox controller market, I'm always on the lookout to test gamepads that offer compelling features at competitive price points.

The gamepad is compatible with Xbox One, Windows 10 PC and Android, too.\n\u2705 You want a premium controller feel without the price tag: With its more premium option priced at a whopping \u00a3159.99 / $179.99 / AU$249.95, Microsoft is offering the average player a slice of its premium pie for a more digestible price.\n\u274c You want lots of extra features: The Xbox Wireless Controller does what it says on the tin and nothing more. It's an excellent pad, but one that's also very straightforward.\nThe Xbox Wireless Controller is the one you\u2019ll get out of the box when you buy a new Xbox Series X|S, and it\u2019s handily one of the best contemporary controllers. But it never hurts to have a spare, right?\nThe Xbox Wireless Controller hasn't changed much in terms of design since its Xbox One iteration. However, there are some notable changes worth highlighting. Overall build quality is slightly improved, and the new D-pad is a huge upgrade, featuring a circular base that makes it easier to perform diagonal inputs.\nXbox Wireless Controllers are readily available, and quite affordable these days across both standard and special colorways thanks to frequent discounts. Several more hues are also available if you\u2019d prefer something flashier, but most of these do cost slightly more. Alternatively, you can even make your own custom Xbox Wireless Controller over at the Xbox Design Lab.\nThe Xbox Wireless Controller ticks most of the boxes of what makes a pad great. High-quality buttons, a best-in-class d-pad and generous battery life are among the controller\u2019s best features. Put simply, you just can\u2019t go wrong with the Xbox Wireless Controller no matter your budget or preferences. It\u2019s an all-rounder, but one that excels in almost every area.\n- Read more: Xbox Wireless Controller review\nThe best budget Xbox controller\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You\u2019re on a budget: Though wired controllers tend to be cheaper generally, the 8BitDo Pro 2 pad offers great pro-level features and hardware construction.\n\u2705 You prefer Sony-style thumbsticks: Side-by-side sticks are the design of choice for PlayStation players, and this is one of the best ways to get that configuration on Xbox.\n\u274c You like asymmetrical sticks: This pad doesn\u2019t follow the standard Xbox controller layout, meaning you\u2019re going to need to look elsewhere for offset sticks.\nIt\u2019s hard to go wrong with an 8BitDo pad. The 8BitDo Ultimate controller for Nintendo Switch is testament to that. Thankfully, the popular third party manufacturer also has a fantastic option for Xbox owners in the Pro 2 Wired controller.\nThe Pro 2 is a touch on the light side. However, it does feature two back paddle buttons that can be remapped to your liking. Excellent for if you\u2019d rather have certain commands on a more accessible button, for example. The most notable change from other Xbox controllers is the use of a symmetrical analog stick layout, similar to the PS5's DualSense. That won't be for everyone, but it does free up space on the top half of the pad, allowing for more real estate for the face buttons and D-pad.\nThe most immediately striking thing about the Pro 2 has to be its price. It's an affordable pad, but don\u2019t let that fool you into thinking it\u2019s of a low quality. On the contrary, the Pro 2 upholds 8BitDo\u2019s typically high build quality, making for a pad that\u2019s as satisfying to use as it is to purchase.\nDespite its budget price, you'll find a controller here that performs admirably during play. The pad's modules are all up to that high 8BitDo quality, with tactile buttons, sticks and triggers. The D-pad does feel a touch mushy, though, and is a downgrade from the one found on the Xbox Wireless Controller.\n- Read more: 8BitDo Pro 2 wired controller review\nThe best premium Xbox controller\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want class-leading performance\nThe V3 Pro\u2019s speedy actuation across all modules makes for one of the most responsive gamepads out there.\n\u2705 You\u2019re after all the pro features\nHighly customizable and complete with Hall effect sticks, trigger locks and responsive connectivity both wireless and wired, the V3 Pro is that all-in-one premium package.\n\u274c You\u2019re after something more aesthetically pleasing\nPerhaps the weakest aspect of the V3 Pro is its bland all-black aesthetic. This controller is all-function, which may turn away folks who'd prefer something flashier.\nThis is it. The be-all-end-all of premium Xbox controller experiences. Compatible with Xbox consoles and PC, the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro is indeed the best premium controller available for Xbox. And honestly, after weeks of highly enjoyable testing, we reckon it'll take some work to dethrone it.\nIt starts with the overall lightning-fast responsiveness of the controller. Snappy micro-switch buttons, drift-resistant Hall effect thumbsticks and remappable buttons that make use of Razer gaming mice tech all lead to speedy actuation. This makes it an excellent choice for competitive gamers of all skill levels. The jump up from 250Hz to 1,000Hz polling rate when you hook it up to a PC via wired connection is a beautiful addition, too. During our testing, we also found that a wired connection had immediate responsiveness, which makes the V3 Pro a superb pick for competitive first-person shooters, fighting games and racing games.\nNow at $199.99 / \u00a3199.99, the V3 Pro obviously isn't cheap. However, I feel Razer's latest gamepad more than justifies its price point with the feature set it brings to the table. And if you don't quite have the budget, a cheaper model known as the Razer Wolverine V3: Tournament Edition comes in at $99.99 / \u00a399.99. This is a wired-only model that loses some overall build quality, but retains the V3 Pro's premium feature set.\nWhile middling battery life and a bland all-black look are a shame, they're really the only dents in the V3 Pro's otherwise immaculate image. If you're looking to own the absolute best of the best when it comes to premium gamepads, this is the one to go for without question.\n- Read more: Razer Wolverine V3 Pro review\nThe best mid-range Xbox controller\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You like Pro-adjacent features: The PowerA Fusion Pro 3 has you covered with mappable rear buttons, swappable sticks, dedicated mic volume switch and more.\n\u2705 You play shooters online: The Fusion Pro 3\u2019s trigger locks are excellent for first and third-person shooters.\n\u274c You want a premium feel: The controller feels a little cheap and flimsy for its price range, though the buttons, sticks and D-pad do improve things here.\nThe PowerA Fusion Pro 3 isn't quite a premium purchase, but has a robust feature set that you won't find on cheaper pads. You're getting programmable rear buttons here, that can be assigned as secondary inputs for your go-to games. And multiple profiles mean that you can swap as you switch from game to game during your play sessions.\nThe shell of the gamepad is slightly lacking in overall build quality, feeling a little cheap and lightweight. Still, what matters is that the buttons, triggers and sticks feel relatively great, living up to the Fusion Pro 3's mid-range price tag.\nAnother strong feature here, that you won't find on other pads, is the dedicated mic volume switch you'll find at the center bottom of the controller. This is a wonderful addition that saves you from having to dive into your console's settings to adjust your mic's output.\n- Read more: PowerA Fusion Pro 3 review\nThe best wired Xbox controller\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want an Xbox version of an amazing PC controller: The Kaleid is already an incredible PC controller, and features in our best PC controllers list. Now, that same quality is available for Xbox players.\n\u2705 You like deep customization: Many things are customizable through the Nexus app, a version of which is available on Xbox and PC.\n\u274c You'd prefer to go wireless: As good as the Kaleid is, the lack of wireless connectivity may be irksome for some who prefer to lose the cables.\nThe GameSir Kaleid is already one of our favorite PC controllers (that version being named the T4 Kaleid), and finally the budget-friendly brand has seen fit to manufacture a version of the gamepad that's compatible with Xbox consoles. And it's fantastic.\nThe Xbox version of the GameSir Kaleid has all of the original's best features. Drift resistant Hall effect sticks, mappable rear buttons for secondary inputs, a gorgeous translucent design brightened by smartly-layered RGB, and a robust app that allows for in-depth customization of all of these elements and more.\nAt a decent $49.99 / \u00a359.99, the Kaleid comes in at roughly the same price as the Xbox Wireless Controller. And indeed, the only real dealbreaker with the Kaleid is its lack of wireless connectivity. Still, if you're willing to trade that for some truly superb features, you'll find a long-lasting and visually striking controller here.\n- Read more: GameSir Kaleid review\nThe best Xbox controller for voice chat\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want excellent voice chat features: There's lots to explore with the Recon's voice chat suite, including on-board controls and EQ settings.\n\u2705 You want enhanced audio: The Recon supports Turtle Beach's own Enhanced Audio, meaning you'll get a stronger sound profile with practically any headset.\n\u274c You want something simpler: While robust, the Recon's busy on-board audio controls do lend a slightly convoluted feel to the pad.\nIf you're in voice chat with friends more often than not when playing your favorite multiplayer games on Xbox, consider the Turtle Beach Recon controller, which has been designed around offering an excellent voice chat experience. That, and its bespoke Superhuman audio setting that lets you hone in on distant sounds; perfect for pinpointing gunshots and footsteps in large-scale games like PUBG Battlegrounds and Warzone.\nThe controller itself is no slouch, either, with good quality buttons and sticks, mappable back paddle buttons and comfy padded grips to prevent slipping in particularly heated multiplayer moments. If you\u2019re sick of fiddling with your console\u2019s mic settings menu, then you\u2019ll likely gel with the fact that the Recon lets you control right on the pad itself.\nRight on the controller itself is a central dock packed with audio settings for voice chat, including four Turtle Beach EQ settings offering various balances between chat and game audio. If you're an audio-first player, then the Turtle Beach Recon is the ideal pad for you.\n- Read more: Turtle Beach Recon Controller review\nThe best budget wired Xbox controller\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You\u2019re on a strict budget: \u2018Pro\u2019 adjacent pads don\u2019t get more affordable than the Clutch Gladiate. It\u2019s certainly one to consider if you want to keep costs low.\n\u2705 You\u2019re interested in some light \u2018Pro\u2019 features: Remappable rear buttons and hair trigger locks provide a good introduction to higher-end controller features on a pad this affordable.\n\u274c You want more \u2018Pro\u2019 features: The Clutch Gladiate is still light on \u2018Pro\u2019 adjacent touches, and the hair trigger locks are a bit of a letdown here.\nThe HyperX Clutch Gladiate is an aggressively budget option for those who prefer a wired controller. While build quality is lacking in relation to the competition, it's nonetheless an impressively-performing pad with some 'Pro' level features you won't find on the Xbox Wireless Controller.\nThe HyperX Clutch Gladiate shines when it comes to feel. Its face buttons and analog sticks are close to on par with Microsoft's official pad. Add in a couple of tactile, mappable back buttons (a rarity on controllers this affordable), and you've got a controller that provides excellent feel and is worthwhile as a spare, so long as you don't mind the wired only connection.\nThere are some flaws here, which is understandable for the price. In the Clutch Gladiate's case, it's the inconsistent hair trigger locks, which after testing, don't work as intended on a range of Xbox Series X games. Curiously, we had no issues using the trigger locks while gaming on PC, even in testing the same game across both platforms. As a result, you may prefer the HyperX Clutch Gladiate as a PC pad.\n- Read more: HyperX Clutch Gladiate review\nThe best Xbox controller for customizability\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a high degree of customizability: The eSwap X2's modules can be swapped at any time, and with any configuration.\n\u2705 You're left-handed or prefer symmetrical sticks: Have an easier time with the face buttons on the left, or prefer your analog sticks to be lined up? Both are possible here.\n\u274c You're after a wireless controller: Unfortunately, the Thrustmaster eSwap X2 doesn't offer a wireless configuration, which may prove irksome to those who prefer a clutter-free setup.\nThrustmaster's second go at a modular controller may not look like much of an improvement at surface level. And indeed, there's really only smaller updates scattered throughout. However, if you're looking for a highly customizable controller that lets you swap around buttons, sticks and the d-pad at will, there's no better choice than the eSwap X2.\nThese swappable modules allow for a highly accessible gamepad. If you're an Xbox player, but prefer the symmetrical stick layout of, say, the DualSense on PS5, you can do that here. Similarly, left-handed players may prefer to slot the face button module in on the left side of the pad.\nWhile the lofty price tag may cause you to balk, and the lack of wireless connectivity is certainly a shame, the Thrustmaster eSwap X2 still puts forward an impressively customizable experience that's second to none for Xbox players.\n- Read more: Thrustmaster eSwap X2 review\nThe best Xbox controller for fighting games\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You\u2019re after an entry-level Xbox stick: 8BitDo\u2019s Xbox fight stick is the best for the console at its price point and is perfectly suited for first-time stick users.\n\u2705 You\u2019ve just bought Street Fighter 6: Street Fighter 6 has done a phenomenal job onboarding new players, and its multiple control schemes complement first-time fight stick users well.\n\u274c You want something less weighty: The 8BitDo Arcade Stick for Xbox is bulkier than your average controller, so you might not get on with it for longer gaming sessions.\nAfter the success of the excellent 8BitDo Arcade Stick for Nintendo Switch, which features in our best fight sticks buying guide, the hardware manufacturer is back with a bespoke Xbox version of the same fantastic stick.\nDesign-wise, most thing here are identical to its counterpart, but has an Xbox makeover that's aesthetically fitting for the console. It retains the same weight and feature set as its Nintendo Switch counterpart, so all you're really getting here is console compatibility.\nIt's also one of the more affordable fight sticks on the market that's actually worth buying. But of course, we can only really recommend it if you regularly play fighters like Guilty Gear Strive or Street Fighter 6. If you don't, then you'll be better served shopping for one of the other gamepads on this list.\nThe 8BitDo Arcade Stick for Xbox has the same robust feature set as its Switch counterpart. It supports both wired and wireless play (via an included dongle), and is also fully customizable. That means if you don't like the default parts, you can open it up with a screwdriver to replace them with your own.\n- Read more: 8BitDo Arcade Stick for Xbox review\nBest Xbox controllers - FAQs\nWhich Xbox controllers are the best?\nIf we had to isolate a couple of controllers from this list, and you can afford them, we have to put forward the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro and the GameSir Kaleid. The former is the full premium package, with unrivaled build quality and superbly responsive modules. The GameSir is the next best thing, coming in at a much cheaper price tag while also offering \u2018Pro\u2019 features like Hall effect sticks and slick RGB lighting.\nAre cheap Xbox controllers worth it?\nIf you're after a controller as a spare gamepad for any extra players, you won't want to pay top dollar for it. Generally, most third-party controllers offer a decent product without hosting a significant price tag, especially in comparison to some of Microsoft's official offerings. For a kickabout controller, cheap alternatives are always worth it.\nAre wired or wireless controllers better for Xbox?\nIt all depends on personal preference. If your console is set up at a desk, you're probably closer to your screen, so a wired controller won't feel like too much of a tether. But, if you're using one of the best gaming TVs rather than one of the best monitors for Xbox, a wireless controller provides a little more flexibility.\nWhat's the difference between Xbox Elite Series 2 and Core?\nThe Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 and the later-released Core edition are, essentially, the same controller. Core versions have a few more color schemes to choose from (white, red, and blue). However, they lack any of the additional accessories that come with the standard Series 2 pad, like those swappable parts and rear paddles. Core controllers, then, are cheaper to buy, and the accessory pack can be bought separately.\nWhat causes stick drift in Xbox controllers?\nThe standard Xbox Wireless Controller relies on traditional analog sticks, and don't feature Hall effect technology. As a result, stick drift is more likely to occur as the sticks' internals wear down over time thanks to their physical potentiometers. Hall effect utilizes a magnetic connection for stick movement, meaning there's no physical part to wear down, leading to much longer life overall.\nWill updating my Xbox controller fix stick drift?\nUnfortunately not. Xbox controller updates are typically for firmware updates. While updates like this can reduce input latency or offer other quality-of-life improvements, stick drift is more of a hardware-related issue as mentioned above. You'd be better off sending your controller to Microsoft for repairs, or replace it entirely if you've the means to do so.\nHow we test the best Xbox controllers\nThe best Xbox controllers are tested and reviewed based on a number of criteria, including design, feature set and arguably most importantly of all, price. There's rarely a one-size-fits-all Xbox controller, so we endeavor to test each to their strengths, such as options for voice chat or being suited to a particular genre.\nAlso tested...\nWe've tested tons of Xbox controllers here at TechRadar Gaming. Naturally, this means that not all of them will quite make the cut for this list. However, there are still plenty worth shouting about, so here's a handful of honorable mentions we think you should consider.\nXbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2\nXbox's own premium controller once ruled the roost when it came to luxury gamepads, but it has since been outflanked by the likes of the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro. The Elite Series 2 is still a great controller, though, and regularly winds up on sale during major deals periods.\nFor more information, read our full Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 review\nNacon Revolution X Unlimited\nI love Nacon's latest attempt at a premium Xbox gamepad. Featuring a handy built-in screen for gamepad customization and sublime Hall effect sticks, it's only beaten by the Wolverine V3 Pro on the grounds of overall build quality, which is far superior with Razer's pad.\nFor more information, read our Nacon Revolution X Unlimited review\nThrustmaster Heart\nThe Thrustmaster Heart is a top performer, featuring the brand's own take on Hall effect sticks and offering pin-sharp gaming performance.\nFor more information, read our Thrustmaster Heart review\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for over four years.

      "text": "Best PS5 controllers in 2025\nThe best PS5 controllers you can buy right now\nThe best PS5 controllers aren't as abundant as other platforms when it comes to overall choice. That's obviously a bit of a shame, but what is available is still absolutely worth a look - especially if you're in the market for a DualSense alternative. And you're in luck if you are, as next week's Prime Day deals are bound to feature top discounts on quality PS5 controllers.\nUnlike most of the best PC controllers and best Xbox controllers, Sony's DualSense and premium DualSense Edge controllers do have a unique selling point. They feature bespoke haptic feedback and adaptive triggers that you won't find anywhere else - not even from other gamepads in this list. With these features, supported games have a much more immersive and robust rumble register.\nSome PC games even support this feature, making Sony's official PS5 controllers excellent choices for desktop play too. You will definitely find haptic support in PlayStation Studios games ported to PC, for example, such as Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered and Horizon Forbidden West.\nWe've tested and reviewed every PS5 controller in this list; across TechRadar Gaming, our team of hardware experts scrutinize each controller to a granular degree, across a wide range of game genres from platformers and shooters to fighting and racing games. As a result, you can be safe in the knowledge that our carefully curated guide will have a PS5 controller that suits your budget and preferences.\nThe Quick List\nBest overall\nBest overall\nThe DualSense is our top pick for the best PS5 controller for its aggressive point point, suite of bespoke features, and native compatibility with the console.\nBest pro\nBest pro\nThe DualSense Edge retains all the features of the original model but adds enhanced functionality such as extra sticks, D-pads, and remappable buttons geared towards high-level play.\nBest modular\nBest versatile\nThe Victrix Pro BFG features a modularity unlike any other PS5 controller on the market as you have the ability to swap out the sticks, D-pads, and buttons out to suit different genres.\nBest custom\nBest custom\nThere's nothing better on the market than the Scuf Reflex Pro if you want to add further customization to your DualSense controller. It also features pro-level features, too.\nBest for accessibility\nBest for accessibility\nThe PlayStation Access is the PS5's official accessibility controller, allowing disabled players or those with particular requirements a better means to play their favorite games.\nBest fight stick\nBest fight stick\nWith its arcade-quality stick and buttons, the Nacon Daija is the perfect companion to some of the best fighting games available on the platform.\nI'll be the first to admit that compared to other platforms, there's not much to go around in terms of quality PS5-compatible controllers. Sony's own DualSense is of course incredible, but alternatives tend to be on the pricier side of things.\nThat said, I've still managed to highlight a handful of excellent PS5 controllers that are worth your time and money. The selections in this list cover options that may be suited to particular genres, such as first-person shooters or fighting games, or offer ways to play for those who require additional forms of accessibility.\nBest PS5 controllers in 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest overall PS5 controller\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want all the leading PS5 controller features: The DualSense features haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, a touchpad, and gyro controls as the most advanced OEM pad on the market.\n\u274c You want a PS5 controller with good battery life: All the bells and whistles come at a price as the DualSense only averages around 4-8 hours on a single charge.\nThe DualSense Wireless Controller takes the top spot as the best PS5 controller right now. It offers excellent build quality and features even higher-end alternatives don\u2019t. We\u2019ve been using this particular controller now for over three years to great success because of the genuinely innovative inclusions of haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, which both first and third-party game developers are utilizing in exciting ways.\nExtra features aside, the DualSense is just an incredibly well-designed gamepad to have in your hands. A little curvier than the DualShock 4 that shipped with the PS4, this makes for a controller that\u2019s more comfortable to use for long play sessions. Every aspect of the controller, such as the face buttons, the D-pad, and those all-star triggers, feels great to the touch.\nWhere the DualSense is let down by the battery life. All these extra bells and whistles come at a cost: you can expect anywhere from four to eight hours of use between charges. We often found ourselves reaching for the included USB-C cable when going the distance in longer titles such as God of War Raganrok and Ghost of Tsushima.\n- Read more: DualSense Wireless Controller review\nBest pro PS5 controller\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want an official pro controller: Unlike other pro-level PS5 controllers, the DualSense Edge retains everything from the DualSense while adding remappable buttons, trigger stops, and improved sticks.\n\u274c You want good value for money: With its steep asking price and worse battery life than the original, the DualSense Edge could be too expensive for some.\nWhile the DualSense Edge is only a slight improvement over the stock model, what\u2019s offered here with this upgraded version is more likely to appeal to hardcore gamers. Priced at $199.99 / \u00a3209.99 / AU$339.95, this gamepad isn\u2019t meant to replace the standard PS5 controller.\nThe biggest upgrade with the DualSense Edge is in the build quality and aesthetic tweaks. It\u2019s down to the redesigned triggers, touchpad, and slightly heavier chassis. It feels like a premium product while offering the extra functionality you should expect from a controller that\u2019s more than double the cost of a standard DualSense.\nWe particularly enjoyed the adjustable trigger stops, rear paddles, and function buttons which made a real difference in games like Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 and Returnal. Depending on how you play on your PS5, you\u2019ll either notice these additions as game changers or nice extras.\nThe one thing that the DualSense Edge doesn\u2019t address is the battery life. You can expect anywhere from six to eight hours, depending on what features you\u2019re using. We found that the controller averaged just over seven hours before going flat when utilizing everything that the Edge could do.\nSeeing as some PS5 controllers aimed at the Esports scene strip away core DualSense functionality and cost more than this, such as with the Razer Wolverine V2 Pro, we think this model is a good investment for those who will use it to its full potential.\n- Read more: DualSense Edge review\nBest versatile PS5 controller\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 Modularity is essential for you: The Victrix Pro BFG features additional sticks, D-pads, and even a fight stick module meaning it has a ton of variety for competitive and casual play.\n\u274c You want to retain DualSense functionality: As with other third-party PS5 controllers, you won't find adaptive triggers or rumble of any kind on the Victrix Pro BFG.\nIf you\u2019re after a competitive edge in some of the more demanding PS5 games then you should strongly consider the Victrix Pro BFG controller. That\u2019s because this gamepad features not only five different levels of trigger adjustments, four remappable back paddles, and multiple sticks and D-pads to choose from but also an entire fightpad module, too.\nPriced at $179.99 / \u00a3179.99 / AU$269, the Victrix Pro BFG is considerably more expensive than the standard DualSense, yes, but it does significantly undercut the competition from other first and third-party offerings. A major strength of this PS5 controller that we found in our testing was the lengthy battery life, of which you can expect up to 20 hours, and the lightweight nature of the remote itself. You\u2019ve also got a protective carrying case and a 3m long braided USB-C cable just in case you want to bring it to all kinds of gaming tournaments with you.\nThe trade-off here is that you\u2019re forgoing the DualSense functionality all together. Now, this isn\u2019t just the case with the Victrix BFG Pro, as other officially licensed pads also aren\u2019t using adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. But keep in mind that everything has been stripped back here to prioritize low latency and responsive gaming over more immersive features from the stock PS5 controller.\n- Read more: Victrix Pro BFG review\nBest custom PS5 controller\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a customized DualSense: The Scuf Reflex Pro uses the DualSense as a base and adds remappable paddles as extra buttons and a high-performance grip. You're also able to customize every detail to your liking, too.\n\u274c You enjoy haptic feedback: While the Scuf Reflex Pro features adaptive triggers as standard, these can be swapped out for instant-click versions, it doesn't have haptic feedback, instead just a basic rumble pack.\nThe main attraction of the Scuf Reflex Pro is its customization options, where you can create unique color schemes for your controller with a simple-to-use design tool. You\u2019re paying a pretty penny for the privilege, though. With prices starting at $219.99 / \u00a3219.99 (roughly AU$315), fine-tuning your pad doesn\u2019t come cheap.\nOur review unit has a black and red color scheme with a complementing face plate and color-matched buttons, triggers, bumpers, and D-pad. There are over 25 pre-made designs to choose from and a vast array of color combinations should you want to take things in a different direction. The main thing that separates the standard Reflex from the Pro variant is the \u2018high-performance grip\u2019, which costs $19.99 / \u00a319.99 (approximately $AU38) to add to your controller. We found that it was easily the better investment here as it feels substantially more supportive than the otherwise smooth finish of the DualSense\u2019s chassis.\nThe Scuf Reflex Pro retains everything that makes the PS5 DualSense special, the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. You\u2019re also getting remappable paddles, which you can use to free up your hands over the face buttons. Ultimately, we found these functions are ultimately secondary to the design customization. If you\u2019ve dreamed of having a particular color combo for your PS5 controller with the extra coin to spend, this is a great start.\n- Read more: Scuf Reflex Pro review\nBest PS5 controller for accessibility\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You have accessibility needs that require something extra: With an array of implementations, button types, use cases, and flexibility on offer, the PlayStation Access controller will open doors or should you need something extra in accessibility, be it small changes or large-scale overhauls.\n\u274c You need a total solution from a single accessibility controller: Given that one Access controller cannot, sadly, replace one DualSense controller wholesale, it doesn\u2019t represent a complete solution in a single unit. You can, however, add a second Access controller to achieve this but that increases the cost.\nPreviously known as Project Leonardo, the PlayStation Access controller marks Sony's first official foray into the realm of accessibility-friendly gamepads. The result is a controller that's potentially more accommodating to disabled players than the standard DualSense Wireless Controller. And it comes packed with a range of modules including sets of buttons and tags to help aid players that may require more specific tools.\nComing in at $89.99 / \u00a379.99, the PlayStation Access is unfortunately more expensive than the DualSense. This represents a bit more of a barrier to entry for those on a budget; especially so if you require two Access controllers during play.\nOverall, though, we're happy that Sony has created the Access controller. Many of its first-party games are also being updated with official support. In our review, we appreciated the sheer versatility offered by the Access, as well as its high-quality modules and fantastically-designed joystick.\n- Read more: PlayStation Access controller review\nBest PS5 controller for fighting games\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want an arcade-quality experience: The Nacon Daija is about as close to arcade-level fighting game sticks as you can get for the price. It's perfect for wanting authenticity in the likes of Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, and Tekken.\n\u274c You want something lighter: While the Nacon Daija absolutely nails the feel of an authentic arcade setup, it does also happen to be one of the heaviest PS5 fight sticks available.\nIf you\u2019re looking at a new PS5 controller to get the most out of fighting games, then you should look past a traditional gamepad. The Nacon Daija is our pick for the best fight stick. We were continuously impressed with the build quality, the parts used, and the overall responsiveness when battling it out in titles such as Guilty Gear Strive and Tekken 7. It\u2019s not cheap, though: the Daija currently retails for around $292 / \u00a3240 from its \u20ac279.90 cited MSRP.\nThe Nacon Daija is a controller, with a good amount of heft and size, making it stable when the fighting gets intense. We found the Daija comfortable whether used on the lap or a table. What\u2019s particularly great about this controller is you can open it up to make repairs or any upgrades to the buttons, switches, and stick if required. Given that you\u2019re getting top-of-the-line Sanwa-Denshi parts here, we never saw the immediate need to swap these out.\nWhile primarily marketed at the fighting game community, the Nacon Daija is also a superstar for your arcade games. We particularly enjoyed run-throughs of titles such as Streets of Rage 4, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredders Revenge, and Metal Slug 3. Given the price tag, it\u2019s certainly an investment, but if you want to take on the latest and greatest fighting games with superior input control than a gamepad, then we think it\u2019s worth a shot.\n- Read more: Nacon Daija arcade stick review\nBest PS5 controllers - FAQs\nAre PS5 controllers compatible with PC?\nYes! Both the DualSense and DualSense Edge have official PC support and will work straight away via a wired USB-C connection. Some games - particularly PC ports of PlayStation Studios titles - also have full haptic feedback and adaptive trigger support, so you'll be able to get that console-like experience on desktop, too.\nWill PS5 controllers work on PS4?\nWhile most third-party PS5 controllers also work on the PS4, including the Victrix Pro BFG, that isn't the case for the official DualSense or DualSense Edge. These are bespoke PS5 controllers and aren't compatible with Sony's last-gen system. As mentioned above, they do work on PC, at least.\nDo PS5 controllers have a mic?\nIt depends on the controller, but both the DualSense and DualSense Edge have built-in mics that you can use if you don't have a gaming headset. That said, the overall quality here isn't going to be as clear as you'd get from a traditional gaming headset. On that note, most PS5 controllers, including official models, have a 3.5mm headphone jack for wired headsets, and the PS5 supports USB dongles for wireless connectivity.\nDo PS5 controllers get stick drift?\nThe DualSense and DualSense Edge are going to be more prone to stick drift than many third-party models. That's because neither controller features Hall effect thumbsticks, instead relying on a more traditional physical connection. That means the stick's internals will wear down over time.\nCan PS5 controllers work on Switch or Switch 2?\nNo. The DualSense can be used on PS5 consoles as well as PC, but are not compatible with Nintendo's consoles, or Microsoft's Xbox consoles for that matter. This is also the case for most third-party PS5 controllers; as they're designed first and foremost for PlayStation, they usually don't share compatibility with other platforms.\nAre PS5 controllers rechargeable?\nYes, and there are multiple ways of recharging them. Your DualSense controller will charge simply by hooking it up to the PS5 console via USB-C connection. Alternatively, the DualSense Charging Station (sold separately) can house up to two controllers, and will charge them over time by simply resting them in the dock.\nHow to choose a PS5 controller\nThe advantage of having a relatively limited pool of PS5 controllers to choose from, is that it's very easy to pick one that's suited to your budget and preferences. By design, the DualSense and DualSense Edge have an advantage over other gamepads in their bespoke haptic feedback and adaptive trigger support.\nIf you love single-player games and want some genuinely class-leading physical feedback to go along with them, we'd recommend either of these. But, only go for the Edge if you have the budget to do so, as it's Sony's pricier premium pick. The DualSense should be your first port of call, but this is admittedly because of Sony's strict third-party limitations. No other PS5 controllers can offer haptics or even turn on the console from the gamepad itself due to Sony's rules.\nIf you want a PS5 controller kitted out with high-end features, look no further than the Victrix BFG Pro. This modular controller lets you swap out individual parts, and features handy additions like trigger stops, remappable buttons and - crucially - excellent build quality.\nHow we test the best PS5 controllers\nOnly two of the best PS5 controllers feature Sony's bespoke haptic feedback and adaptive trigger technology; those being its official DualSense and DualSense Edge gamepads. This already makes the pair worthy of being in this list, thanks to the high quality of these features paired with the high level of comfort and build quality they provide.\nWhen looking elsewhere, we make sure to test the best PS5 controllers on more traditional factors. These include build quality, features that are useful during gameplay (such as remappable buttons or swappable modules) or if they're particularly well-suited to one or two specific genres, as you can see with the Nacon Daija above.\nPrice is also a huge consideration here. And while there aren't a great deal of budget picks for PS5 (supported gamepads here do tend to be pricier than third-party offerings on Xbox and Switch), we've endeavored to cover as broad a price spectrum as possible while still ensuring each pick meets our quality standard.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for over four years.

      "text": "Best PC controllers in 2025: top gamepads from GameSir, Thrustmaster and more\nOur guide to the best PC controllers we recommend in 2025\nThe best PC controllers offer up an excellent alternative to playing with a mouse and keyboard on desktops or gaming laptops. They're a fantastic option if your 9 to 5 has you hunched over a desk and you'd prefer to sit back and unwind when gaming at home. And with Prime Day deals right around the corner, happening next week, it's one of the best times all year to find a new favorite.\nOur list of the best PC controllers has been curated based on a number of crucial factors. Build quality, performance and features are essentially the three pillars that separate truly worthwhile PC controllers from the rest of the crowd. We've also carefully considered our options based on price, longevity and overall value for money, with our picks spanning all across the budget spectrum. That means you won't necessarily need to break the bank for a quality gamepad, as we see from the likes of Xbox and GameSir.\nThe TechRadar Gaming team has tested and reviewed all of the best PC controllers in this list. We're all gamers at heart, so we endeavor to test controllers across a wide range of genres, including first-person shooters, fighting games, racing games, platformers and more. Sometimes, we find that a particular PC controller is well-suited to a specific type of game, and in these cases, we like to compare them against similar products to gauge why they're worth your time and money over the competition.\nIf you're after more console-specific choices, be sure to peruse our guides to the best PS5 controllers, best Xbox controllers, and best Nintendo Switch controllers, too.\nAs an avid gamer who's owned everything from a Dreamcast to a Nintendo Switch, I've got years of experience in professionally testing console and PC controllers. At TechRadar Gaming, I've tested upwards of 50 controllers for review. And on PC, controllers are my go-to method of play, preferring them greatly over a traditional mouse and keyboard setup.\nThe quick list\nBest overall\nBest overall\nOur overall pick for the thanks to its excellent software support, fair price, and wide variety of available colors and styles.\nBest premium\nBest premium\nThe Razer Wolverine V3 Pro is simply the best premium controller on the market today, offering sublime build quality and tons of cool features.\nBest budget\nBest budget\nThe GameSir T4 Kaleid punches above its affordable price tag thanks to its hall effect joysticks and micro switch buttons.\nBest wired\nBest wired\nThe Thrustmaster eSwap X2 is a highly versatile wired controller with satisfying buttons and a brilliant D-pad.\nBest immersive\nBest immersive\nThe DualSense is also compatible with PC where its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers shine on supported games.\nBest symmetrical\nBest symmetrical\nPrefer symmetrical stick layouts?

This workhorse gamepad is readily available globally and stands out thanks to its high build quality, comfortable ergonomic design, tactical buttons, and formidable D-pad. The Xbox Wireless Controller is also readily compatible with Windows PCs, meaning it's ready to go right out of the box.\nOffering both wired and wireless play, it is also a very versatile and easy-to-use choice. With prices starting at $59.99 / \u00a354.99 / AU$74.99 (and receiving frequent discounts in sales), you're getting an awful lot of bang for your buck. There are also a wide range of color options to choose from, including the ability to fully customize the look of your controller with the Xbox Design Lab.\nThe only drawback is the lack of any additional features. While some other controllers on this list offer modular input options or additional buttons, you\u2019re only getting the basics here. If you're interested in extras like remappable rear buttons or trigger stops, consider checking out the Victrix Pro BFG, which we have listed below.\n- Read more: Xbox Wireless Controller review\nBest premium PC controller\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nI won't beat around the bush; the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro is simply the best premium PC controller on the market today - and perhaps the greatest to ever do it. It certainly costs a pretty penny, but you're getting your money's worth with a sublime controller experience that cannot be matched.\nThe controller's build quality is exceptional, which is something we've come to expect from the brand over the years. However, where the V3 Pro really shines is in its individual modules. Hall effect sticks and mechanical buttons (powered by tactile Razer mouse click technology) all feel fantastic and highly responsive during play.\nIt remains my go-to PC controller to this day, and I find it hard to believe that another gamepad will take its premium spot in this list anytime soon. The only real downside to the controller - besides its lofty price tag - is that its battery life certainly isn't the greatest at around 12 hours. That said, if you prefer to play via wired connection - or regularly keep a habit of topping up your controllers - this shouldn't be much of an issue for you.\n- Read more: Razer Wolverine V3 Pro review\nBest budget PC controller\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe GameSir T4 Kaleid is one of the best budget PC controllers on the market today. For only $41.99 / \u00a341.99 (around AU$62), it offers a level of comfort comparable to some of the more established brands in our list and packs a suite of unique features, too. One look at the GameSir T4 Kaleid will tell you that this isn't your everyday budget PC controller. Armed with RGB lighting and a translucent design, this look might not be for everyone but it definitely helps it stand out from the crowd.\nWe were also impressed with the controller's performance in our testing, where we noted the satisfying buttons and responsive joysticks. As this controller is on the cheaper end, it should be no surprise that it is restricted solely to wired play. Thankfully, however, with a total cable length of 2m / 7ft it shouldn't be much of a struggle to use this with your existing setup.\nUnlike other controllers in this price range, the GameSir T4 Kaleid also benefits from a modern USB-C connection and the T4k desktop app, which allows you to program and map the buttons on the controller to suit your preferences.\nSadly, console compatibility is limited here. If you want to game on console as well as PC, consider checking out the Xbox Wireless Controller (for Xbox users) or the DualSense (for those of you on PS5).\nRead more: GameSir T4 Kaleid review\nBest wired PC controller\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLike some other entries on this list, the Thrustmaster eSwap X2 features a versatile modular design that allows you to mix and match parts as you wish. It can be configured to either an asymmetrical or symmetrical layout with ease by simply removing the modules from their magnetic sockets. With a very classy black and gold design, the controller is packed with suitably high-end components including an extremely satisfying set of tactile buttons and a responsive D-pad.\nThere are also trigger locks, in addition to four rear buttons. Although your mileage is likely to vary, our testing found that the round shape of these rear buttons meant that they could be a little fiddly to press at times. Elsewhere, the controller connects to your PC via an included USB-C cable and will work well with any titles that support a traditional Xbox controller. If you crave even more customization, Thrustmaster sells a wide variety of modules that are compatible with this controller. These range from modules with extra buttons intended for the best fighting games to alternate thumbsticks and D-pads.\n- Read more: Thrustmaster eSwap X2 review\nBest immersive PC controller\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe DualSense is a truly excellent PS5 controller, but it's also perfect for PC. While you need to be plugged in via USB-C to utilize the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, it's well worth it for the level of immersion that these features add to games which support them. If you're going to be playing Sony published PC titles like The Last of Us Part 1, Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, and Returnal, this should be your top pick.\nAs a PC controller, the DualSense will be immediately familiar to anyone who is more used to a symmetric layout as opposed to the Xbox asymmetric sticks. It's got a highly ergonomic design and you're also getting a laptop-like touchpad which can be used in supported titles for added functionality. It's incredibly easy to use on PC either plugged in or with Bluetooth thanks to the custom controller mapping features of Steam's Big Picture Mode.\nWith a starting price of $69.99 / \u00a359.99 / AU$109.95, and plenty of colors and styles available, the DualSense is a competitively priced PC controller that offers a lot more than many premium offerings. While the support may not be quite as widespread as with the Xbox Wireless Controller, you're benefiting from immersion you just won't get anywhere else. Just be wary of the battery life, which is very much on the shorter end.\n- Read more: DualSense Wireless Controller review\nBest symmetrical PC controller\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe GameSir Tarantula Pro is easily one of our favorite controllers to be released last year. As PC controllers go, it's among the best that adopt a PlayStation-style symmetrical stick layout. It also handily has the DualSense Wireless Controller beat on features, and at the same price point too.\nOne of the GameSir Tarantula Pro's standout features is its quick-switch LED-based face button layouts. A quick macro via the multifunction button on the rear of the pad can swap between Xbox and Nintendo Switch face button layouts. Many PC games also offer these layouts as in-game options, too, making the Tarantula Pro a fine choice for those who prefer either/or.\nKnown for being an innovative brand, GameSir has employed its own TMR thumbsticks which aim to combine the longevity of Hall effect and the responsiveness of more traditional stick types. They feel great and responsive during gameplay, and it's likely GameSir will stick to this standard for its future controllers.\n- Read more: GameSir Tarantula Pro review\nBest modular PC controller\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you're after modularity, then the Victrix BFG Pro is our top pick. With easily removable parts, it boasts a wealth of alternate options on how you can set it up. The sticks and buttons can be moved around to suit different play styles and there is even an entire fight pad module that can replace the traditional four-face buttons for better performance in fighting games. You can also swap the orientation of the sticks to either an asymmetric or in-line layout. There are also four remappable paddles on the back for added versatility as well.\nWith its price point of $179.99 / \u00a3179.99 / AU$269, the Victrix BFG Pro is one of the most expensive options in our roundup, however, it offers a level of modularity that a lot of the other options don't. Unlike the DualSense, our choice for the most immersive PC controller, you won't be getting any of the fancy PS5 features here, as there's no adaptive triggers or any rumble to speak of whatsoever.\n- Read more: Victrix Pro BFG review\nBest PC controller for racing games\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nWhat happens when you combine the functionality of one of the best racing wheels with a conventional PC controller? The answer is the Thrustmaster eSwap Pro XR Forza Horizon 5 Edition - a modular controller with its very own wheel module. In our testing, we found that this gamepad's unique racing wheel accessory made for a truly exceptional racing experience , even if it took a little getting used to at first.\nRetailing for around $179.99 / \u00a3179.99 / AU$379, you're paying a hefty premium on the complete package. However, it is also possible to pick up the racing module alone for only $29.99 / \u00a326.99 / $62.74 that is fully compatible with the standard Thrustmaster eSwap Pro which can often be found much cheaper. Still, it's hard to overstate just how much precision this addition adds to the racing experience. If you're going to be playing any of the best racing games, consider picking one of these up.\nBest PC controller for fighting games\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Nacon Daija is our top pick for the best fighting game controller on PC and is an excellent accessory choice thanks to the extensive catalog of fighting games available on the platform including the most recent AAA fighting titles like the excellent Street Fighter 6 and Mortal Kombat 1.\nIn our testing, we found that the Nacon Daija ranks well above its competition thanks to the ultra-responsive Sanwa joystick and robust buttons that lend the pad a very authentic arcade feel. It's a rugged design, however, which means that it could be considered too bulky side for some - especially if you want play with it on your lap. Despite this, there's nothing that comes close to this level of quality for the price.\nWhile this price is very reasonable for a fight stick, it does set you back around $249.99 / \u00a3249.99 / AU$427, which is quite steep compared to other controllers on this list. This is one for only the most hardcore fighting game fans.\n- Read more: Nacon Daija review\nHow to connect and use controllers on PC\nGiven the amount of contenders there are for best PC controllers nowadays, it's not always simple knowing how to pair, connect, and use them with your rig. That's especially the case when looking at the controllers of other consoles you might be familiar with or already have. Luckily we have all the tools you should need for those major console controller.\nFor PlayStation pad users, we've got guides on how to use a DualSense on PC or how to use a DualShock 4 on PC, while for those who prefer an asymmetrical controller, we've got guides on how to use an Xbox One controller on PC, how to use an Xbox Series X controller on PC (spoilers: it's similar to the former), and also how to use a Switch Pro controller on PC.\nBest PC controllers - FAQs\nWhat controller do pro PC players use?\nPlayers who like to take their game to the next level, particularly in online multiplayer environments, may opt for a controller for more advanced features, assuming they're not already playing with a keyboard and mouse. Gamepads like the Victrix Pro BFG or the Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra offer useful features in this regard, but do command higher price tags as a result. Similarly, pro players may opt for more specialist kit like a racing wheel or a fight stick like the Nacon Daija for more specific genre needs.\nIs it possible to use a Nintendo Switch or PS5 controller on PC?\nThe short answer is yes! While Nintendo doesn't advertise its Nintendo Switch Pro Controller as PC compatible, you are able to hook it up to your PC as Steam offers compatibility for the controller. Similarly, both the DualSense and DualSense Edge for PS5 will work on PC, and even offer their bespoke haptic feedback and adaptive triggers for compatible titles.\nShould you buy a PC controller?\nAt the end of the day, whether or not you should buy a PC controller will ultimately come down to how much you think you will use it. If you often play lots of racing games, for example, then it will definitely be worth investing in a controller. The same goes for fighting games, where most players prefer to use a controller or even specialist fight stick.\nIf you play lots of genres that don't traditionally benefit from that control scheme, however, then a PC controller might not be worth it for you. Those who play lots of strategy games likely won't spent a lot of time using it, making it far from the best use for your money. That said, you can always choose a budget-friendly controller if you're on the fence.\nDo most PC gamers use a controller?\nWe wouldn't say 'most' necessarily. The PC is an ideal platform for specific genres, such as real-time strategy, MOBAs, MMORPGs and grand strategy titles. These are best played with a mouse and keyboard due to the need to quick navigation and shortcuts. Many players also prefer a keyboard and mouse for shooters. That said, controllers have been widely adopted by PC gamers for many years now, and a lot of players prefer to sit back with a gamepad as opposed to potentially being hunched over a desk.\nDo controllers lag on PC?\nIt depends. A wired controller connected via USB-C will typically have the least amount of input lag, and it's practically non-existent over a wired connection. Going wireless, whether that's via 2.4GHz or Bluetooth, can cause some input lag issues. But these days, it's impressively minimal and will only really matter in hyper-competitive multiplayer environments. Overall, you shouldn't experience any noticeable controller lag for casual play unless there's something wrong with the pad.\nHow we test the best PC controllers\nWe test the best PC controllers with a variety of factors in mind. The main thing we look at is overall value for money; what does a controller offer at its price point that makes it stand out from the crowd?\nFor example, we love the GameSir T4 Kaleid for its excellent build quality and robust feature set despite the low price tag. Similarly, the Victrix Pro BFG is impressively modular, justifying its higher retail price with plenty of modifiable extras.\nWe also consider controllers from a longevity standpoint. Longer lasting controllers will typically boast exceptional build quality, and often have features like Hall effect thumbsticks to help prevent that dreaded stick drift. Furthermore, dedicated software that lets owners customize their controllers even further is a great bonus, too.\nEach of the entries included on this list has been extensively tested by a member of the TechRadar team. We only choose controllers that we know will deliver the best performance for you based on our hands-on experience.\nHow to choose a PC controller\nThe closest to a one-size-fits-all controller in this list is our 'best overall' pick, that being the Xbox Wireless Controller thanks to its excellent build quality, versatility and reasonable price point. However, we're aware that many of you will want a controller that's either flashier, has more features, or both.\nLooking for a gamepad that packs in extra features like RGB lighting and remappable rear buttons? You may wish to consider the GameSir T4 Kaleid. For those of you who prize modularity and customizability, then the Victrix Pro BFG or Thrustmaster eSwap X2 can be considered.\nSimilarly, some controllers are fantastic for specific genres. As an example, you may want to look at the Nacon Daija if you're planning on purchasing a dedicated fighting game controller. Meanwhile, the 8BitDo Pro 2 is perfect for retro and arcade titles.\nAlso tested\nThere are some excellent PC-compatible controllers out there that haven't quite made the 'best of' cut. Still, we do think they're worth recommending in their own right if none of the above options suit your preferences. You can read about these, along with their accompanying reviews, below.\nDualSense Edge\nSony's premium PS5 controller is a good PC fit thanks to native compatibility and its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers which are also supported by PlayStation Studios' PC ports and some other titles. It just misses out on our list due to other premium options being more PC-centric, however.\nRead our full DualSense Edge review\n8BitDo Ultimate\n8BitDo's phenomenal gamepad tops our best Switch controllers guide, but it's also a great fit for PC. It can be used wirelessly here via the 2.4GHz dongle, or wired via the USB-C cable. This controller also comes with a neat charging dock, making PC charging a doddle.\nRead our full 8BitDo Ultimate review\n8BitDo Arcade Stick for Xbox\nIt has Xbox in the name, but it's also compatible with PC for play with fighting games like Street Fighter 6 and Tekken 8. It's much cheaper than the Nacon Daija but still brings the goods in terms of quality and feel.\nRead our full 8BitDo Arcade Stick for Xbox review\nThrustmaster Heart\nThe Thrustmaster Heart impresses with pin-sharp Hall effect thumbsticks, great-feeling buttons and an eye-catching design. Its price outweights a relative lack of features, though, and no wireless connectivity certainly hurts. Still, it's one to look out for whenever it goes on sale.\nRead our full Thrustmaster Heart review\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for over four years.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Horipad Turbo is a worthwhile Nintendo Switch controller if you\u2019re on a tight budget. While its light build and relative lack of ancillary features are fitting of its low price point, it\u2019s hard to hold that against a gamepad that otherwise performs great on the console it\u2019s designed for. It's wired only and has some unfortunate omissions here and there, but you can do a whole lot worse for 30 bucks even if more recent, similarly priced controllers have it beat on features.\nPros\n- +\nResponsive, nice-feeling sticks and buttons\n- +\nExcellent digital triggers\n- +\nSome lovely officially licensed Nintendo liveries\n- +\nTurbo button works great in retro games\nCons\n- -\nWired only\n- -\nBudget build quality\n- -\nD-pad is the weakest element\n- -\nLacks gyro or vibration support\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nHoripad Turbo: One-minute review\nIt\u2019s hard to find good Nintendo Switch controllers at the $30 / \u00a330 price mark. Typically, budget gamepads around this point simply don\u2019t feel all that great to play with and often have a build quality that leaves a lot to be desired. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised by the Horipad Turbo, a budget Switch controller that certainly has some of the hallmarks of a cheap pad, but manages to make up for it in other key areas.\nObviously, some compromises have been made to keep costs low. The Horipad Turbo does feel lightweight and somewhat hollow in the hands. It\u2019s a strictly wired controller and doesn\u2019t offer arguably basic features like gyro aiming, vibration, or remappable rear buttons. I\u2019m also not the biggest fan of its simple, mushy D-pad.\nBut the Horipad Turbo gets most other things right where it counts. Its thumbsticks and buttons all feel great, and its satisfying-to-press digital triggers are perfectly suited for the best Nintendo Switch games. The titular Turbo function also works very well and is quite robust with three distinct input settings.\nThrow in options for officially licensed liveries inspired by Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda series, and it\u2019s clear that a lot of thought and care has gone into making the Horipad Turbo an attractive budget option. If you\u2019re interested in purchasing a new Nintendo Switch controller, then, but don\u2019t have the funds to splash out on the likes of the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller or 8BitDo Ultimate, I highly recommend checking out the Horipad Turbo instead.\nHoripad Turbo: Price and availability\n- $29.99 / \u00a329.99\n- Available in three colorways\n- UK availability appears to be very limited\nThe Horipad Turbo is available to purchase for $29.99 / \u00a329.99. In the US, it\u2019s available on Hori\u2019s own website as well as Amazon. Unfortunately, it\u2019s much more difficult to track down in the UK. Here, Hori\u2019s website doesn\u2019t currently have any stock, and listings at retailers like Amazon are limited (though often come in well under the retail price).\nThree distinct colorways are available for the Horipad Turbo. There is a standard black version, as well as fancier liveries for The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario. These don\u2019t cost any extra, either, so you\u2019re free to pick one that best suits your tastes without making a bigger dent in your wallet.\nBefore you do decide to pull the trigger, though, I would also recommend you check out the GameSir Nova Lite. This controller comes in at $24.99 / \u00a329.99 and is more widely available in both regions. It also has some key upgrades over the Horipad Turbo, including Hall effect sticks and wireless connectivity. It still lacks gyro aiming, however.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nHoripad Turbo: Specs\nPrice | $29.99 / \u00a329.99 |\nDimensions | 6.1 x 4.7 x 2.5in / 155 x 119 x 64mm |\nWeight | 0.77lbs / 0.35kg |\nConnection type | Wired (USB) |\nCompatibility | Nintendo Switch, PC |\nSoftware | N/A |\nHoripad Turbo: Design and features\n- Lightweight build, but certainly not uncomfortable\n- Standard asymmetrical layout like the Switch Pro Controller\n- Overly mushy-feeling D-pad\nThe Horipad Turbo very much comes as advertised (well, apart from one particular thing that I\u2019ll touch on in the performance section below). The box contains the wired controller, an instruction booklet and that\u2019s it. No fancy extras like swappable thumbsticks, carry cases, or all that jazz. But this is to be expected for a gamepad that\u2019s firmly placed in the budget price bracket.\nThe controller itself certainly has a budget, plastic feel, and it\u2019s extremely lightweight. As a result, it feels almost listless in the hands. However, this isn\u2019t to say holding the controller is unpleasant. While it lacks textured grips a la the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, it\u2019s comfortable enough and easy to keep a firm grip on while you play.\nSticks and face buttons both feel great to use and the bumpers, while a little chunky for my tastes, are still adequate. The digital ZL and ZR triggers are the real stars of the show, with an immediate press that\u2019s perfect for the vast majority of the first-party Nintendo Switch game library.\nThe clue\u2019s in the name when it comes to the Horipad Turbo\u2019s key feature. Its Turbo functionality allows for rapid inputs simply by holding down the button it\u2019s assigned to.\nTo do this, simply hold the Turbo button in the center of the gamepad, followed by your face button of choice. There are options for 5, 10, and 20 inputs per second. So it\u2019s a great fit for simpler, arcade-like titles you might find within the Nintendo Switch Online retro libraries. Prefer being able to quickfire projectiles in games like Blaster Master and Super R-Type? The Turbo button can help shave some of that difficulty off while keeping your thumb thoroughly blister-free.\nThe controller\u2019s 10ft (3m) cable is industry standard, but as it\u2019s non-braided it did tend to coil up more than I\u2019d like. The D-pad is also a real letdown here. For one, it\u2019s really thin, making diagonal inputs a touch harder than they need to be. It also feels very mushy to press, leading to a pretty unsatisfying gameplay experience. Stick to those analog sticks for movement if you can.\nHoripad Turbo: Performance\n- Perfectly responsive across all fronts\n- Works on PC as well as Nintendo Switch\n- Missing features include rumble and gyro aiming\nThe Horipad Turbo is compatible primarily with the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch OLED models. You won\u2019t get PlayStation or Xbox functionality here, but the controller is compatible with PC. This is not mentioned on Hori\u2019s website or on the box itself, but I was able to hook the controller up to my PC via USB and it worked there without issue.\nThat said, I think the Horipad Turbo is a better fit for the Switch, and not just because of those officially licensed liveries. It\u2019s got the Switch\u2019s \u2018reversed\u2019 face button layout (with X/Y and A/B swapped from the typical XInput layout) and its digital triggers are perfect for a game library where pressure-sensitive triggers are never really required.\nAs a result, it\u2019s a great fit for several games that I tested, including Super Mario Odyssey, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - all games where quick trigger presses are utilized regularly. Though when it came to both Zelda and Splatoon 3, I certainly did lament the lack of gyro aiming here. The fact there\u2019s no rumble, while less of a dealbreaker overall, is also a shame.\nShould I buy the Horipad Turbo?\nBuy it if...\nYou\u2019re on a tight budget\nThe Horipad Turbo is one of the most affordable Nintendo Switch controller options that, similar to the GameSir Nova Lite, I can actually recommend thanks to its overall strong performance despite some middling build quality.\nYou prefer more precise trigger presses\nThe Horipad Turbo\u2019s digital triggers are a blessing on Switch, and I much prefer them over the more traditional analog triggers you find on most controllers.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou\u2019re a Splatoon 3 player\nOne of the most unfortunate omissions here is the lack of gyro aiming. You can of course use the analog sticks for aiming in Splatoon 3, but do you really want to do that?\nYou were hoping for more features\nEven more recent controllers at a similar price like the GameSir Nova Lite have the Horipad Turbo beat on features, like offering Hall effect sticks and wireless connectivity.\nAlso consider...\nThe Horipad Turbo is a solid controller, but if you\u2019re after a new Nintendo Switch gamepad you may also wish to consider these budget-friendly alternatives.\n| Row 0 - Cell 0 | Horipad Turbo | GameSir Nova Lite | 8BitDo Ultimate C |\nPrice | $29.99 / \u00a329.99 | $24.99 / \u00a329.99 | $29.99 / \u00a324.99 |\nDimensions | 6.1 x 4.7 x 2.5in / 155 x 119 x 64mm | 6.1 x 4.1 x 2.4in / 155 x 104 x 61mm | 5.8 x 4.1 x 2.4in / 147 x 104 x 61mm |\nWeight | 0.77lbs / 0.35kg | 0.66lbs / 0.3kg | 0.45lbs / 0.2kg |\nConnection type | Wired (USB) | Wireless (2.4GHz, Bluetooth), Wired (USB Type-C) | Wireless (Bluetooth), Wired (USB Type-C) |\nCompatibility | Nintendo Switch, PC | Nintendo Switch, PC, Android, iOS | Nintendo Switch, PC, Android, iOS |\nGameSir Nova Lite\nMy favorite budget Nintendo Switch pad offers drift-resistant Hall effect thumbsticks and wireless connectivity with up to 15 hours of battery life. It\u2019s technically an upgrade when compared to the Horipad Turbo, offering several customization options via its multifunction button. It doesn\u2019t have Turbo functionality, though, on top of missing out on gyro aiming.\nRead our full GameSir Nova Lite review\n8BitDo Ultimate C\nAnother incredibly budget-friendly controller, it carries on the brand\u2019s tradition of having excellent build quality despite the low price.\nRead our full 8BitDo Ultimate C review\nHow I tested the Horipad Turbo\n- Tested over the course of a week\n- Played primarily on Nintendo Switch with some PC\n- Compared and contrasted mainly with the GameSir Nova Lite\nI tested the Horipad Turbo for this review for roughly a week. During that time I tried the gamepad with a range of top Nintendo Switch games, including Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Super Mario Odyssey, Astral Chain, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. I also put the Turbo button through its paces by playing a variety of fitting retro titles on Nintendo Switch Online. These included Blaster Master, Ninja Gaiden, Mario Party 3, and Super R-Type.\nI also spent some time comparing the Horipad Turbo to what I feel is its closest budget equivalent - the GameSir Nova Lite. I do prefer GameSir\u2019s controller, owing to its Hall effect sticks and wireless connectivity options. But the Horipad Turbo isn\u2019t far off, with similar build quality and a nice Turbo button addition. Both controllers lack gyro aiming, though, which is a bit of a shame.\nFirst reviewed February 2025\nRhys is TRG's Hardware Editor, and has been part of the TechRadar team for over four years.
