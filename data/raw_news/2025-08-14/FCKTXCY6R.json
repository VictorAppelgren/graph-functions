  "description": "Most stocks fell on Wall Street following a disappointing update on inflation.",
  "content": "Trader Robert Oswald works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Thursday, Aug. 14, 2025.\n\nMost stocks fell on Wall Street Thursday after a disappointing report said inflation was worse last month at the U.S. wholesale level than economists expected. But gains for Amazon and some other influential Big Tech companies helped mask the losses.\n\nSeven out of every 10 stocks within the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 fell, though the index edged up by less than 0.1% to set another all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 11 points, or less than 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite dipped by less than 0.1% from its record set the day before.\n\nThe inflation report said that prices jumped 3.3% last month at the U.S. wholesale level from a year earlier. That was well above the 2.5% rate that economists had forecast, and it could hint at higher inflation ahead for U.S. shoppers as it makes its way through the system.\n\nThe data forced traders to second guess their widespread consensus that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next meeting in September. Lower rates can boost investment prices and the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment, but they also risk worsening inflation.\n\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t slam the door on a September rate cut,\u201d but it may raise some doubt, according to Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley.\n\nTraders now see a 7.4% chance that the Fed may hold rates steady in September, according to data from CME Group. A day earlier, they were betting on a 100% certainty that the Fed would cut its main rate for the first time this year.\n\nHigher interest rates drag on all kinds of companies by keeping the cost to borrow high. They can hurt smaller companies in particular because they often need to borrow to grow. The Russell 2000 index of smaller U.S. stocks tumbled a market-leading 1.2%.\n\nThursday\u2019s disappointing data followed an encouraging update earlier in the week on prices at the consumer level. A separate report on Thursday, meanwhile, said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. That\u2019s a good sign for workers, indicating that layoffs remain relatively low at a time when job openings have become more difficult to find.\n\nBut a solid job market could also give the Fed less reason to cut interest rates in the short term.\n\nThe data helped send Treasury yields higher in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.28% from 4.20% just before the data reports\u2019 release and from 4.24% late Wednesday.\n\nOn Wall Street, Tapestry tumbled after the company behind the Coach and Kate Spade New York brands showed it\u2019s feeling the pressure of tariffs.\n\nIt detailed how much profit it could lose in its upcoming fiscal year because of tariffs and duties, and its forecast for profit fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations even though its forecast for revenue came in above. Its stock fell 15.7%, despite it also reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.\n\nDeere fell 6.8% even though the machinery maker likewise delivered a better profit than expected. There, too, the focus was on where profits are heading. It cut the top end of its forecasted range for profit this fiscal year and said its customers \u201cremain cautious amid ongoing uncertainty.\u201d\n\nOn the winning side of Wall Street was Fossil Group, which jumped 29.8% after the seller of watches and other accessories reported better profit than expected. It also announced a plan to strengthen its finances, while trimming its forecast for how much it expects worldwide net sales to fall this year.\n\nBig Tech stocks also helped mask Wall Street\u2019s losses. Amazon rose 2.9% to add to its gains from the prior day when it announced same-day delivery of fresh groceries in more than 1,000 cities and towns.\n\nBecause Amazon is so huge, with a market value of $2.45 trillion, the movements for its stock carry much more weight on the S&P 500 than the typical company\u2019s.\n\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 1.96 to 6,468.54 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down 11.01 to 44,911.26, and the Nasdaq composite dipped 2.47 to 21.710.67.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed across Asia and Europe ahead of a key meeting between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday.\n\nChoe writes for the Associated Press.",

      "text": "Over 160 Blizzard workers in Irvine join union as gaming-industry labor movement expands\n- Share via\nMore than 160 workers at video game company Blizzard Entertainment have voted to unionize.\nThe workers, who produce in-house cinematics, animation, trailers, promotional videos and other narrative content, are just the latest batch in the video game industry to unionize, with more than 6,000 having organized across the U.S. and Canada.\nA wave of organizing in the industry has been driven in recent years by such issues as crunch-time hours before a product releases, job insecurity and workplace harassment.\nAmid complaints about crunch times, claims of discrimination and calls for fair and transparent pay, more video game workers are seeking to unionize.\nThe newly unionized workers are largely based in Irvine, where Blizzard Entertainment\u2019s campus is located. They will join Communications Workers of America Local 9510 in Orange County.\nJohn Giarratana, a cinematic producer who works out of the Irvine campus, said he and other workers had become frustrated with frequent layoffs and with lack of remote work options. Activision Blizzard laid off about 400 workers last year.\n\u201cPeople who work in games, a lot of the reason is they love [games], they want to make them and share them with people,\u201d Giarratana said. \u201cBut these waves of layoffs are really hard. It makes it hard to make games, it makes it hard to be creative, and it makes it hard to want to do this work.\u201d\nMicrosoft Corp.-owned Blizzard Entertainment has recognized the union.\nThe company is a subsidiary of Santa Monica-based Activision Blizzard, the largest game company in the Americas.\nActivision Blizzard was created in 2008 when Santa Monica-based Activision merged with the parent company of Blizzard Entertainment. It\u2019s known for successful titles such as \u201cCall of Duty,\u201d \u201cWarcraft,\u201d \u201cOverwatch,\u201d \u201cHearthstone\u201d and \u201cCandy Crush.\u201d It was acquired in 2023 by tech giant Microsoft.\nThe worker vote did not have to go through a typical election overseen by the National Labor Relations Board because Microsoft pledged to take a neutral stance toward workers who sought to form a union.\nMicrosoft\u2019s pledge, unusual among largely nonunionized tech giants, has paved the way for thousands of additional workers to more easily unionize.\n\u201cWe continue to support our employees\u2019 right to choose how they are represented in the workplace,\u201d a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement last year.\nBlizzard did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nNearly 3,000 workers at Microsoft-owned studios have unionized with CWA thus far, according to union spokesperson Sean Nesmith. CWA is the largest media and telecommunications labor union in the U.S.\nNorth America saw its first video game union form at the end of 2021 at Vodeo Games, an indie studio with about a dozen employees.\nIn 2022, a small group of quality assurance workers at Raven Software, an Activision Blizzard-owned game studio in Wisconsin, unionized \u2014 marking the arrival of the first labor union at a major U.S. gaming company.\nAnd last year, more than 500 game developers at Blizzard Entertainment who work on the blockbuster video game \u201cWorld of Warcraft\u201d elected to form a union."

      "text": "What can retirees do to deduct medical expenses?\n- Share via\nDear Liz: My wife and I, both in our early 90s, are fortunate to have good health insurance. However, we have significant expenses that are not covered. As you might expect, we are retired and receive income from Social Security, pensions, annuities and investments. Are we eligible to use flexible health accounts funded with pretax dollars? If so, what\u2019s the best way to set that up and how would we pay those uncovered health bills?\nAnswer: Unfortunately, you don\u2019t have access to pretax accounts that could help you pay medical bills.\nFlexible spending accounts are offered by employers, and contributions are limited annually (in 2025, the limit is $3,300). Health savings accounts have higher limits but require you to have a qualifying high-deductible health insurance plan. Once you\u2019re on Medicare, as you two presumably are, you are no longer allowed to contribute to an HSA.\nYou might be able to deduct medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of your adjusted gross income. To claim the deduction, you would need to have enough itemized expenses to exceed the standard deduction, which in 2025 is $34,700 for a married couple filing jointly who are 65 and older. (The standard deduction for a married couple filing jointly is $31,500, while people 65 and older get an additional deduction of $1,600 each.)\nThere\u2019s also a new, temporary $6,000 deduction for people 65 and older that is available whether you itemize or take the standard deduction. This bonus deduction begins to phase out for adjusted gross income above $150,000 for married couples filing jointly and disappears at AGIs above $250,000. This deduction is set to expire after the 2028 tax year.\nDear Liz: I was perplexed by your column in which you pooh-poohed pay-on-death and transfer-on-death accounts in favor of trusts. But you gave no specific explanation. Rather, you said trusts \u201cgenerally allow a smoother, more organized settlement of the estate than other probate-avoidance options.\u201d Would you please explain what is smoother and more organized than POD and TOD transfers? (Beneficiary deeds fall into the same category as POD and TOD, to my way of thinking.) These transfers simply involve a copy of the death certificate and some minimal paperwork. What could be simpler?\nAnswer: The fact that you asked this question suggests you may not be familiar with the many ways these transfers can cause unintended problems. An estate planning attorney could fill you in.\nOne issue covered previously in this column is the fact that the person settling the estate typically needs money to pay final bills. If all the funds in the estate have been transferred to beneficiaries, the executor would have to beg for money to be returned (with no guarantee beneficiaries will cooperate) or pay the expenses out of their own pocket.\nAnother obvious issue is unequal distribution if you have more than one heir. Account values can change over time, leading to sometimes dramatic differences in what the beneficiaries receive.\nSpeaking of change, it\u2019s the one constant in life. A living trust allows you to easily update your estate plan in one centralized place as circumstances change. Altering beneficiary designations can take a lot more work, and it\u2019s easy to miss an account if you have several.\nBeneficiary designations offer limited contingency planning. If the beneficiaries die before you or otherwise can\u2019t inherit, the account could come back into your estate and be subject to probate. Also, many people forget to update their beneficiaries after major life changes, which can mean the wrong people inherit. More than one ex-spouse has received retirement funds or life insurance proceeds because the beneficiary form wasn\u2019t updated.\nAnother unfortunately common occurrence is an inheritance that disqualifies a disabled beneficiary from receiving government benefits. You also can\u2019t control how money is spent with a beneficiary designation, which can be a problem if the beneficiary is a minor, an addict or a spendthrift.\nPlus, people get sued. Beneficiary designations offer no protection against creditors, while a properly written trust can help protect your assets and your heirs\u2019 inheritance.\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list of the potential issues with beneficiary designations. They can be a solution for people with limited funds who can\u2019t afford to pay an estate planning attorney, or when they\u2019re part of a coordinated estate plan. Many people set up a trust for real estate and financial accounts, for example, and use beneficiaries for retirement accounts, notes Jennifer Sawday, an estate planning attorney in Long Beach.\nThe more money you have and the more complex your situation, the more you \u2014 and your heirs \u2014 would benefit from expert, individualized advice.\nLiz Weston, Certified Financial Planner, is a personal finance columnist.

      "text": "California\u2019s burger wars heat up as Habit Burger & Grill trolls In-N-Out with new billboard\n- Share via\nHabit Burger & Grill has doubled down on its provocative marketing strategy, updating its billboard trolling of burger giant In-N-Out for a second consecutive year after once again beating the chain in a national ranking.\nHabit has updated its existing billboard near Los Angeles International Airport, directly across from an In-N-Out location on Sepulveda Boulevard, to reflect its rival\u2019s drop to fourth place in USA Today\u2019s 10 Best fast-food burger rankings. The same sign from last year has been recycled, with the \u201c#2\u201d crossed out in red and replaced with \u201c#4.\u201d\nIn-N-Out CEO Lynsi Snyder moves her family east to Tennessee, citing California\u2019s difficult environment for raising kids and business operations.\nThe company \u2014 which took first place for the best fast-food burger (the Double Char) \u2014 also earned top rankings from USA Today for best fast casual restaurant and best fast-food side dish for its tempura green beans.\n\u201cWe congratulated In-N-Out on being #2 last year with a billboard,\u201d Jack Hinchliffe, chief marketing officer at Habit, said in a press release. \u201cThis year, we were going to send a gift but couldn\u2019t afford the postage to Tennessee, so we saved a few bucks and reused the same billboard. We just had to swap out the 2 for a 4.\u201d\nThe Tennessee reference is a pointed jab at In-N-Out\u2019s eastward expansion. In January 2023, the company announced plans to establish an Eastern territory office in Franklin, Tenn., by 2026. Last month, billionaire owner and Chief Executive Lynsi Snyder announced on a conservative podcast that she is personally leaving California for Tennessee.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of great things about California, but raising a family is not easy here. Doing business is not easy here,\u201d Snyder said during her appearance on a conservative podcast. She specifically cited COVID-19 pandemic-era restrictions as particularly challenging for business operations.\nSnyder\u2019s departure represents a seismic shift for the leader of a brand that has been a pillar of California fast-food culture for more than 75 years.\nThe move places In-N-Out among a growing list of major companies relocating from California, including electric car maker Tesla, financial services firm Charles Schwab, and oil giant Chevron, all citing regulatory challenges, operational costs and policy disagreements.\nDespite a growing narrative that California is hostile to businesses, experts say the state still has unmatched advantages.\nThe timing of Habit\u2019s latest marketing gambit coincides with In-N-Out\u2019s continued decline in the annual USA Today rankings. In-N-Out ranked sixth in 2023, second in 2024, and fourth this year.\nUSA Today\u2019s 10 Best contests rely on expert panels to select nominees, followed by public voting to determine winners. While not scientific, the rankings have gained attention among consumers.\nThe billboard campaign represents an asymmetric marketing battle between two companies of vastly different sizes. In-N-Out operates more than 400 locations across eight states, while Habit has more than 385 restaurants across 14 states and international markets since opening its first location in Santa Barbara in 1969.\n\u201cWe were born in Santa Barbara in 1969, remain proudly Californian and we\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d Hinchliffe said.\nBoth chains maintain their headquarters in Irvine, located about seven miles apart, though In-N-Out plans to consolidate its California operations in Baldwin Park, where Harry Snyder, Lynsi Snyder\u2019s grandfather, co-founded the company in 1948.\nThe In-N-Out billboard is part of a broader campaign by Habit targeting multiple competitors. The company has deployed mobile billboards to locations near other chains that made the USA Today rankings, including Chipotle, Five Guys, Shake Shack and Panera Bread, offering congratulatory messages on their lower rankings.\nIn-N-Out did not respond to a request for comment."
