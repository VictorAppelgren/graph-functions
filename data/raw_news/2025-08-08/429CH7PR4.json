  "content": "President Donald Trump said Friday that he\u2019ll be meeting \u201cvery shortly\u201d with Russian President Vladimir Putin and previewed terms of a potential peace deal to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be meeting very shortly with President Putin,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House. \u201cIt would have been sooner, but I guess there\u2019s security arrangements that, unfortunately, people have to make,\u201d he continued, adding that Putin would \u201clike to meet as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nTrump said he\u2019d share more details on his administration\u2019s efforts to secure a peace deal, as well as a \u201cpopular\u201d location for talks with Putin, \u201ca little bit later.\u201d\n\nThe United States and Russia have been working on a potential deal to stop the war in Ukraine that would lock in some of Russia\u2019s gains, a European official and US official tell CNN earlier Friday. The deal is not finalized and could fall through.\n\nThe United States has been trying to get allies to agree to this plan, one of the sources told CNN, which came amid the push to secure a summit between Putin and Trump. However, some us officials have expressed concern that Russia will not honor a deal.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are dying, and I think we\u2019re getting very close, and we\u2019re going to be announcing later on, we\u2019re going to have a meeting with Russia \u2014 start off with Russia, and we\u2019ll announce the location,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe president, who\u2019d acknowledged frustration with Russia\u2019s president in recent months for drawing out the conflict, seemed more optimistic for the prospect of a peace deal Friday.\n\n\u201cThe European leaders want to see peace,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Putin, I believe, wants to see peace, and Zelensky wants to see peace.\u201d\n\nHe later added: \u201cMy instinct really tells me that we have a shot at\u201d peace.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump pledged he\u2019d apply new sanctions on Russia if Putin didn\u2019t end the war in Ukraine by Friday, but he struck a less hardline tone on Thursday, telling reporters in the Oval Office, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be up to (Putin)\u201d if the Friday deadline would hold.\n\nPressed by CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins Thursday if Putin would have to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as a prerequisite for a face-to-face meeting between Trump and Putin, Trump said, \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",
