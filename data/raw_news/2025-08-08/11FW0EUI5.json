  "content": "The average U.S. tariff rate is estimated to rise to 11.4% in 2025 in the light of much of the Trump administration\u2019s so-called reciprocal tariffs reinstated since this week. This is according to calculations by the Tax Foundation based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. International Trade Commission. The rate was last this high in the 1940s, which marked a transition period that saw tariff rates come down from higher Great Depression levels towards those associated with the most recent era of trade liberalization and trade agreements.\n\nWhile 50% tariff rates on Brazil are already in effect\u2014making them the highest under current U.S. policy\u201450% tariffs on India are supposed to go live at the end of the month. Both countries have seen these extraordinarily high tariff levels tied to actions the Trump administration thinks they should be discontinuing. For Brazil, it is the prosecution of Trump ally and former President Jair Bolsonaro, while for India the reason given is the import of copious amounts of cheap Russian oil that has been shunned in the world markets. Beside these, the highest rates the administration has set internationally are 41% on imports from Syria, 40% on those from Laos and Myanmar as well as 39% for goods from Switzerland.\n\nThe U.S. average tariff rate would be even higher were it not for trade agreements (or more frequently their rough outlines) that the U.S. has set up with seven international partners over the past months. The deals are lowering import duties for the European Union from 30% to 15% and for Japan and South Korea from 25% to 15%. These rates are applicable for the import of cars also, which are tariffed separately by the Trump administration. The United Kingdom even lowered the automotive rate to 10% for 100,000 British cars annually and got its steel and aluminium tariffs thrown out, while Vietnam\u2019s trade agreement lowered its overall rate significantly. However, on August 12, a pause on higher tariffs with China might come to an end, which could shake things up once more.\n\nThe Tax Foundation estimates that the true tariff rate for the U.S. is currently higher, also when taking into account how much of which tariffed good is actually imported. The so-called applied trade-weighted average now stands at a whopping 21.1%, according to the organization. The analysts, however, expect the effective rate after behavioral adjustments by buyers and importers to arrive at 11.4%. At a government revenue increase of a projected 0.53%, Trump\u2019s tariffs constitute the largest tax hike since 1993, the Tax Foundation writes, critizising the businesses and consumers are expected to bear the brunt of the extra cost that imports to the United States now incur.\n\nDue to numerous exceptions, also now including all goods covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, an estimated 70 percent of U.S. imports are currently subject to tariffs. In 10 years, the would accrue $2.1 trillion, still only a fraction of the current annual U.S. GDP of around $28 trillion. However, The U.S. is expected to lose 0.8% of GDP due to them as well as almost 80,000 jobs. This compared to GDP losses of 0.2% and job losses of 27,000 for Trump\u2019s first-term tariffs. For the regular American, after-tax income is expected to decrease by around 1%.",

      "text": "On Wednesday, the latest trade deal of the U.S. with a foreign country to avoid high tariffs was announced. South Korea and the United States said that they only made an oral agreement due to time constraints lowering the Asian country's tariffs to 15 percent (from a threatened 25 percent), including on cars, and agreeing South Korea would invest in the U.S.\nPreviously, the United States and the European Union agreed on a deal that is lowering tariffs on European goods to 15 percent also. Taking into account exceptions, it is estimated that around 70 percent of EU imports to the U.S. will be affected by the new rate. The EU as part of the agreement is also investing an additional $600 billion in the U.S. and will purchase $750 billion worth of U.S. energy products. There has been no announcement of adjusted EU tariffs. As of the latest data, the EU only collects a levy on around a quarter of U.S. imports, the opposite of the new trade deal scenario, with the tariff rates on imports to the EU also lower.\nOther deals struck with developed nations resemble the EU and South Korea agreements, showing two distinct themes for Trump's new trade deals that right now number only seven - a far cry from the dozens Trump announced should be closed before the August 4 deadline. Japan also agreed to big investments and purchases from the United States in exchange to a U.S. tariff rate lowered to 15 percent while keeping its import tariffs the same. A May deal also left the United Kingdom's import tariff rates intact while lowering U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium to zero and carving out an exception for the import of 100,000 British cars at a rate of 10 percent. As the country never received a higher, so-called reciprocal tariff announcement from the Trump administration, its overall additional tariff is the globally announced 10 percent, which also remained unchanged.\nWhile these seems like a lopsided agreements, so are other deals that the U.S. has struck with foreign countries to avert August tariff deadlines. The agreements with Asian nations Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines stipulate not only higher-than-before U.S. tariffs, but also nearly unlimited open-market access for U.S. products imported into these nations, something that has garnered heavy criticism in the countries affected."

  "argos_summary": "The average U.S. tariff rate is projected to rise to 11.4% by 2025, influenced by the reinstatement of reciprocal tariffs by the Trump administration, with particularly high rates imposed on Brazil and India. Despite trade agreements that lower tariffs for certain countries, the overall tariff burden is expected to lead to a GDP loss of 0.8% and a decrease in after-tax income for Americans. Recent agreements with South Korea and the EU aim to reduce tariffs in exchange for investments, but criticisms arise regarding the perceived imbalance in these trade deals.",
