  "title": "The Staffing Economics Of Hackathons And On-Chain Credentials",
  "description": "Online hackathons and on-chain CV credentials are replacing traditional developer hiring practices along with their broken economic model.",
  "content": "The tech industry faces a $35,000 problem. That\u2019s what it costs on average to hire a single software developer, according to recent findings from Wellhub and other HR research firms. With 64% of job applicants admitting to r\u00e9sum\u00e9 falsification, up from 55% just two years ago, according to StandOut CV, companies are hemorrhaging money on staffing and bad hires while genuine talent slips through traditional screening processes.\n\nThis verification crisis arrives as the sector confronts a supply-side challenge: there are only 23,000 active Web3 developers globally, compared to nearly 29 million in traditional tech, according to Electric Capital's 2024 Developer Report. The combination of CV fraud and severe talent scarcity is driving a sharp shift in how companies identify and verify , particularly as AI and Web3 converge to create new development paradigms.\n\nrepresents the next evolution of the internet, built on blockchain technology to create a decentralized web where users control their own data, digital assets, and online identities. Unlike today's Web2, dominated by centralized platforms like Google and Facebook, Web3 uses distributed ledger technology to enable peer-to-peer interactions without intermediaries. According to AWS, Web3 includes technologies like smart contracts (self-executing agreements), decentralized applications (dApps), and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).\n\nThe convergence of AI and Web3 is creating unprecedented opportunities. As noted in a World Economic Forum report, this combination enables decentralized AI training networks, ensures AI model transparency through blockchain verification, and creates tamper-proof records of AI-generated content. For developers, this means new skill requirements like understanding smart contract development, decentralized storage systems, and how to build AI models that can operate in trustless environments.\n\n, a Singapore-based platform launched in 2024, takes a pioneering approach to addressing the Web3 developer shortage. By combining Web3 and AI-focused with on-chain credential verification, the platform has grown to 90,000 developers in its first year, hosting over 170 hackathons that have produced over 50 venture-backed projects including Aspecta and Cellula, according to Gate Ventures. Recently, Animoca Brands and Open Campus co-led a $4.1 million early round of financing to expand their solution and acquire related platforms.\n\n\"Developers are a leading indicator of value creation,\" says Kevin Li, HackQuest's co-founder. \"Web3 needs developers, and Web2 has developers. We're building an end-to-end journey from learning your first smart contract to launching your own project.\"\n\nThe platform's focus on AI-Web3 convergence addresses critical industry needs. As research from MDPI indicates, the combination of blockchain and AI creates features like decentralized intelligent systems, automated decision-making, and enhanced data security. These capabilities all require specialized developer skills that traditional education hasn't provided.\n\nOther platforms in the competitive coding ecosystem include:\n\u2022 Kaggle: With over 15 million users, focuses on data science competitions and machine learning challenges\n\u2022 HackerRank: Provides technical assessments and coding challenges to 18 million developers\n\nEach platform takes a different approach, but HackQuest's integration of education, competition, and blockchain verification specifically for Web3 creates a uniquely integrated value proposition.\n\nWhat makes hackathon data particularly valuable is its predictive nature. According to HackerEarth, successful hackathon projects like GroupMe (sold for $80 million) and Carousell demonstrate how competitions can identify viable ventures early.\n\nHackQuest\u2019s data reveals compelling patterns in the AI-Web3 convergence space. Participants creating decentralized AI applications, like systems for verifying models on the blockchain or networks for shared training, receive much more funding for their projects. The platform tracks metrics, including technology stack choices, collaboration patterns, and project completion rates, to identify high-potential teams.\n\n\"Every hackathon project is a data point about future technology trends,\" notes Kevin Li, HackQuest co-founder. The platform\u2019s AI-themed hackathons have surfaced innovations like\n\nGeographic trends are equally revealing. Asia now represents 32% of Web3 developers, with India contributing 17% of new crypto developers in 2024, according to Electric Capital data. HackQuest\u2019s presence across 30+ countries offers specific knowledge about regional talent clusters and emerging .\n\nOn-chain credentials enable a new way of verifying skills and achievements. Unlike traditional CVs or even digital badges, on-chain credentials are recorded on a blockchain, making them tamper-proof, instantly verifiable, and portable across platforms. Each achievement gets cryptographically signed and permanently recorded, whether it's completing a course, winning a hackathon, or contributing to an open-source project.\n\nHackQuest pioneers this approach by creating comprehensive developer profiles on the blockchain. When a developer completes a Web3 course on Solana development, wins a hackathon challenge for building a decentralized AI application, or successfully deploys a smart contract, these achievements are recorded as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) or similar blockchain records.\n\n\"The problem isn't money, it's infrastructure,\" explains Cameron Wang, HackQuest co-founder. \"Web2 has clear pipelines, but Web3 needs to build the same for sustainable growth.\"\n\nThis system addresses multiple pain points. For developers, it provides portable credentials that work across any Web3 platform. For employers, it offers instant verification without background checks. For ecosystems, it delivers real-time data on developer skill distribution. Other initiatives in this space include MIT's experiments with blockchain diplomas, professional certification bodies exploring distributed ledgers, and platforms like Galxe and POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) that issue achievement tokens. However, HackQuest's integration creates an inclusive talent development ecosystem rather than just credentialing.\n\nAlthough the average developer hiring cost is $35,000, some specialized positions reach $50,000 when including recruitment fees and productivity losses. In contrast, hackathon-based identification costs typically range from $5,000 to $ 10,000 per hire.\n\nFor HackQuest's enterprise partners, including major blockchain ecosystems like Mantle, Solana, Arbitrum, Linea, Sui, and BNB Chain, the value extends beyond cost savings. These ecosystems use HackQuest for:\n\u2022 Market intelligence to understand what developers are building, what skills are emerging, and where innovation is heading\n\nThe venture capital perspective is just as compelling. Gartner predicts that by 2025, over 75% of VC and early-stage investor reviews will be informed by AI and data analytics. HackQuest's ability to surface 100+ venture-backable projects provides early deal flow access that traditional sourcing methods miss.\n\nThe convergence of AI and blockchain through platforms like HackQuest is already producing real-world applications. In decentralized finance (DeFi), AI models analyze on-chain data to predict market movements while smart contracts ensure transparent execution. In supply chain management, AI optimizes logistics while blockchain provides immutable tracking.\n\nHackQuest's hackathons have produced innovative solutions addressing the AI-Web3 nexus, including decentralized AI marketplaces where models can be bought, sold, and verified on-chain; privacy-preserving AI training using blockchain to coordinate distributed training without exposing data; AI-powered smart contract auditing with automated security analysis and blockchain-verified results; and decentralized compute networks leveraging unused GPU power for AI training through blockchain coordination.\n\nCritics raise valid concerns about hackathon-based hiring and on-chain credentials. \"Hackathon are short-lived projects built from scratch. In the industry, you tend to build long-term systems on existing systems. So the experience of one doesn't necessarily translate well to the other,\" argues one senior engineering manager commenting on Hacker News. \"Also, some of the best engineers would never participate in these events.\"\n\u2022 Selection bias: These platforms may overlook talented developers who prefer deep, methodical work over competitive coding\n\u2022 Geographic disparities: Developers in regions without strong tech infrastructure have limited access\n\u2022 Privacy concerns: Blockchain's permanent, transparent nature conflicts with \"right to be forgotten\" laws and personal privacy preferences\n\u2022 Standardization issues: Without industry-wide standards, on-chain credentials from different platforms may not be interoperable\n\u2022 Employer readiness: Most HR departments lack the technical knowledge to evaluate blockchain-based credentials\n\nWhile platforms like HackQuest partner with universities to add academic credibility, and others focus on specific niches, many wonder whether competition-based assessment will truly replace traditional hiring methods, or will it remain a supplementary tool?\n\nThe talent verification landscape is evolving in multiple directions simultaneously. As CoinDesk reports, decentralized AI architecture offers both opportunities and challenges for the developer ecosystem.\n\nSeveral trends are emerging across the industry: hybrid verification models combining traditional credentials with on-chain achievements, AI-powered assessment using machine learning algorithms to analyze code quality and collaboration patterns, industry standardization efforts with consortia working to create interoperable credential formats, and privacy-preserving solutions using zero-knowledge proofs to allow skill verification without revealing personal data.\n\nThe Web3 developer shortage remains acute. Electric Capital reports that while experienced developers grew 15% year-over-year, newcomers dropped by 53%. This suggests that despite new platforms and approaches, the central challenge of attracting and retaining Web3 talent persists.\n\nThe convergence of AI, blockchain, and data-driven talent verification isn't just inevitable, it's already underway. Here's what different stakeholders need to do to capitalize on this shift:\n\u2022 Build a verifiable track record now. Participate in hackathons, contribute to open-source projects, and earn on-chain credentials while the space is still emerging\n\u2022 Don't abandon traditional credentials, but supplement them with demonstrable project work\n\u2022 Start pilot programs with hackathon-based recruiting for specific roles, particularly in Web3 and AI\n\u2022 Train HR teams on blockchain credential verification and incorporate it into existing ATS systems\n\u2022 Partner with platforms to host company- that align with actual business needs\n\u2022 Collaborate with industry platforms to ensure academic programs align with market needs\n\u2022 Track hackathon data as an early indicator of emerging technologies and founding teams\n\u2022 Use platform analytics to identify geographic clusters of innovation\n\u2022 Consider hackathon performance as a due diligence factor for technical teams\n\nThe industry needs to move beyond staffing experimentation to implementation. With 85% of hiring managers catching r\u00e9sum\u00e9 fabrications and Web3 facing a critical developer shortage, there\u2019s a significant opportunity cost of inaction. Platforms combining education, competition, and verification offer a proven model that's already producing results: lower hiring costs, better talent identification, and a pipeline of innovation.",

      "text": "It\u2019s 10 a.m. on a Thursday. Instead of back-to-back meetings and project updates, a team huddles over laptops in a buzzing workspace. Code is flying. AI tools are generating UI prototypes in real time. There\u2019s an energy that feels less like a corporate grind and more like a creative sprint. By 2 p.m., teams test a working prototype of an idea that didn\u2019t exist that morning but could lead to the next big innovation.\nWelcome to the age of vibathons, also known as vibe coding: high-speed, AI-powered innovation sprints designed for the next generation of problem-solving. Organizations such as Microsoft host these coding jam events where energy meets innovation.\nA vibathon is a shorter, more intense version of a hackathon that prioritizes speed, creativity and the use of AI tools to accelerate innovation. Unlike traditional hackathons that may stretch over 48 hours, vibathons often run for four to six hours. It reduces the risk of burnout.\nThe goal isn\u2019t to ship a perfect product. It\u2019s to build something tangible and unleash creative momentum.\nWhere hackathons reward brute-force effort and deep technical stacks, vibathons focus on velocity, product thinking andcross-functional collaboration. It\u2019s less about raw code and more about rapid prototyping and inspired decision-making.\nSpeed Is The New Strategy\nIn an era where the biggest bottleneck isn\u2019t technology but time, speed is a competitive advantage. Vibathons compress the innovation cycle, utilizing AI tools such as code generators, design assistants and smart workflows to transform rough ideas into usable prototypes within hours.\nVibeathons aren\u2019t about aiming for flawless execution. Teams rapidly bring ideas to life through immediate, hands-on experimentation. They uncover what works by quickly exposing what doesn\u2019t, turning fast failures into valuable feedback loops.\nWhy AI Is At The Center\nParticipants are encouraged to use generative AI to streamline development. Writing code, generating wireframes, crafting product copy, even simulating user feedback focuses less on busywork and more on solving the actual problem; making the process more efficient positions the company as a leader in its particular market.\nHere\u2019s how to run a high-impact vibathon:\nSet a Bold, Clear Prompt\nFrame the sprint around a specific question or challenge. For example, you could ask:\n- \u201cWhat\u2019s a manual process we could automate in the next hour?\u201d\n- \u201cIf we had to launch a new feature by tonight, what would it be and how would we do it?\u201d\n- \u201cHow could we use AI to solve a customer problem we\u2019ve been ignoring?\u201d\n- \u201cHow might we use existing internal data to deliver new customer value?\u201d\n- \u201cWhat would a radically simpler version of our service look like?\u201d\n- \u201cHow could we reduce customer support tickets by half\u2014using AI tools?\u201d\nInvite A Diverse Mix\nThis shift opens the door to designers, product thinkers, marketers and team members without any coding experience to contribute meaningfully using AI tools as force multipliers.\nPrioritize Momentum, Not Polish\nUse a timer. Limit each build phase to 60\u201390 minutes. Encourage quick, scrappy progress. Remind teams: this is about proof of concept, not production code.\nIntegrate AI Into Every Step\nProvide access to a variety of AI tools such as coding assistants that generate code snippets, design generators that create UI mockups and no-code tools that automate repetitive tasks. Offer quick tutorials to level the playing field early, ensuring that everyone makes the most of these powerful tools.\nShare Prototypes\u2014Then Debrief Fast\nThis step is crucial in fostering a collaborative environment. End with brief, high-impact demos. Focus the debrief on what teams learned, not just what they built. The real outcome is insight.\nCapture Learnings, Not Tasks\nAvoid turning this into a meeting recap. Instead, document big takeaways and new ideas sparked by the sprint. Let the momentum carry into the next work cycle.\nReal industry disruptors are those who rapidly experiment and learn. Vibathons create a container for that kind of thinking. They push teams to transition from planning mode to building mode without waiting for approval from above.\nThey\u2019re not just fast. They\u2019re focused, energizing and deeply instructive. Because in the age of AI, the next big thing isn\u2019t built by committee. It\u2019s prototyped in an afternoon."

      "text": "Imagine if you only had only three days to develop an XR solution that could impact the future of immersive technology. That\u2019s what 80 teams of students, along with a diverse mix of industry professionals from a variety of fields, were challenged to do at this year\u2019s MIT Reality Hack.\nThese teams of converged on the MIT campus to participate in a hackathon focused on XR technology. Having been to hackathons in the past only as an observer, this time I had the privilege of being a judge. I was able to witness the dedication and innovation of the students up close. Their commitment and the energy they poured into their work was truly inspiring.\nI was extremely impressed with two in particular that won top prizes. The Gold prize winner was from the Yeigo team. This team created a smart glass AR mobility aid ensuring that people who use walkers have the right information making height and posture adjustments when using a walker, to prevent further strain and injury. Using the Snap Spectacles they created an AR game where the person using the walker would follow a \u201cvirtual\u201d bouncing ball while receiving prompts to walk standing up and not slouching.\nThe Silver prize went to Through Their Eyes. Using Meta Quest goggles this team developed an app that allows colorblind people to to experience the world vibrantly in a way they haven\u2019t seen before.\nThese are but two of the many inspiring projects from the MIT Reality Hack, a three-day hackathon that I and fellow Forbes contributor Anshel Sag judged after speaking at \"Experiential - The Innovation Conference at MIT Reality Hack\u201d on Jan. 25 and 26 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The hackathon is co-organized by the student group VRAR MIT and Reality Hack, Inc., a 501(3)c. The nonprofit group operates independently of MIT. Its nonprofit organization promotes inclusive access to tools for creation.\nThe projects presented by these innovative groups ran the gamut of environmental, medical, lifestyle, the arts, sensory-helps and so much more. Here is the list of the winners and prizes from the MIT Reality Hack.\nThese students were so excited about what they were doing. They put everything they had into their projects and were excited and having fun crafting technology destined to contribute to our immersive future. I am more convinced than ever that hackathons are essential for the future of tech and provide a significant vehicle for students to use them in the following ways:\n- Skill Development: Hackathons provide students with valuable technical skills needed for future careers. Participants learn new technologies, programming languages, and problem-solving techniques in a fast-paced environment.\n- Networking Opportunities: Students meet like-minded peers, interact with professional engineers, and connect with potential employers. This networking can lead to internships, job opportunities, and long-lasting professional relationships.\n- Career Advancement: Many students include hackathon projects on their resumes, improving their position with employers. Companies often send recruiters to these events specifically to find and mentor new talent.\n- Practical Experience: Hackathons allow students to apply classroom knowledge to real-world problems, bridging the gap between theory and practice.\n- Teamwork and Soft Skills: Collaborating in high-stakes environments teaches students how to work effectively in teams and improves their communication and interpersonal skills.\n- Innovation and Creativity: Hackathons' competitive nature encourages out-of-the-box thinking and fosters innovation. Students are challenged to develop creative solutions to complex problems.\n- Self-awareness and Personal Growth: Participating in hackathons helps students identify their strengths and weaknesses, promoting personal and professional growth.\n- Industry Exposure: Hackathons often involve corporate sponsors, giving students insight into current industry trends and technologies.\n- Motivation and Community Building: These events inspire students to continue learning and creating, often leading to the formation of learning communities and increased engagement in programming-related activities.\nJudging the MIT Reality Hack was one of the highlights of my career. More importantly, it reinforced my belief that our tech future is in good hands with engineering students who are being trained to advance tech innovation. On a related note, my friend David Pogue just covered a music instrument hackathon for CBS\u2019 Sunday Morning show. Another great example of the value of hackathons.\nIf you ever have a chance to observe or, better yet, judge a tech hackathon, please do it. It is exciting and educational and more than worth your time to see our future tech leaders and encourage them on their journey."

      "text": "One way to think about blockchain technology is as part of an important evolution of the internet, a phase some people call Web3. Web3 is often described as a series of open-source and interconnected decentralized applications powered by blockchain computing architecture. It is not synonymous with the Metaverse, which is an equally open-source environment for virtual reality. To understand Web3, it\u2019s important to understand its antecedents.\nWeb1 is used to describe the internet from roughly 1990-2004. In the 1990s and early 2000s, the internet consisted of static pages that users would casually read, or surf. It was read-only and internet users were just consumers of information. Think of companies like Yahoo or America Online that would show news, weather, sports, entertainment and financial information. It essentially put physical newspapers on a global distribution network for anyone to access.\nWeb2 is a name for the current state of the internet, with which users can now interact with web pages. The internet no longer just displays information, but it can change based on a reader's preferences and users can upload content onto the websites of others. Web2 transformed the internet to a read/write model from the initial read only.\nPopular examples include Meta\u2019s Facebook and Google\u2019s\nWeb3 has the potential to change the nature of the internet from corporate-owned networks to controlled by users while maintaining the Web2 functionalities people love today. It can also be described as read/write/own. Users can govern these blockchain-based networks through cryptocurrency tokens. As the network grows, value can accrue to the community through the rising price of tokens.\nWhy We Need Web3\nThe transition to Web2 from Web1 made the internet dynamic and fun. It also created a new business model for internet companies. Only when that model matured did people begin to realize that it was problematic. Web2 companies like Facebook and Google offer ostensibly free services, but there is a hidden cost to privacy as they exploit user data. The companies have generated billions of dollars of advertising revenue by packaging such data for advertisers to create targeted marketing campaigns.\nMore than 80% of Google\u2019s revenue comes from advertisements. By collecting information on user likes, dislikes and attention, advertisers can get their marketing material in front of the demographic most likely to consume their products or services. But data harvesting techniques are not all moral or even legal. In 2019, Facebook received a $5 billion fine from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for user privacy violations\u2013 the largest in the agency\u2019s history.\nWeb2 companies can also change their user terms and conditions at a moment\u2019s notice or simply ban people they do not like.\nThe idea of curated news feeds has arguably increased political polarization and contributed to decaying mental health around the globe. Web2 companies optimize their sites to keep users engaged. In other words, they are designed to be addicting. Unfortunately, this means feeding users the type of information they are most likely to consume, including inflammatory and bombastic headlines known as clickbait. The effects of a constant influx of derisive material on mental health is now a common field of study, and frequent social media use is linked to problems of anxiety, depression and low self-esteem.\nDoes Web3 Fix This?\nDecentralized applications (dapps) are not controlled by a single entity, but by cooperative governance structures. Decisions are not made by a CEO, manager, or a board of directors but are agreed upon by a community of token holders. Furthermore, decisions are not made behind closed doors, but in the open and are publicly documented on a blockchain.\nImagine if every potential business decision made by Facebook and Google had to be proposed to its users before adoption. Most would likely not agree with the extent of data collection, bans and derisive content feeds you see today. Conceptually, Web3 eliminates many of the Web2 issues that derive from its centralization.\nWhy It May Not\nThough Web3 has an ethos of decentralization and privacy preservation, one can make a strong case that it is not a panacea for the drawbacks of the current internet. For one, Web3 is not as decentralized as some people think. Below is a list of initial token allocations for major public blockchains. Major protocols like Solana\nPublic engagement in Web3 is a lot higher than that of private companies, but the point remains. Additionally, for many public blockchain projects, the only way for founders and early investors to realize returns on their investments is to sell their tokens to the public. In that regard, one might consider Web3 as the crypto Wild West, albeit with better marketing. It still operates on largely unregulated dynamics where early entrants make huge profits by selling to later participants.\nConclusion\nWe are still in a Web2 world. The FAANG stocks of Facebook (now Meta), Apple\nIn truth, Web3 is very far away from dominating the internet. The goal of many self-designated Web3 champions is to restructure the internet from corporate-owned to user-controlled networks by taking advantage of blockchain technology. To the extent that this is happening at all, it is far more centralized than many make it out to be, and the user experience is often seen as clunky, compared with internet giants that have had decades to refine their products. Despite this, the technology now exists to restructure the internet in a way that benefits users rather than companies.\nForbes is a bona fide news publication, not an investment advisor, registered broker-dealer, or exchange, and nothing in this publication should be construed as investment advice, research, or investment advisory services.
