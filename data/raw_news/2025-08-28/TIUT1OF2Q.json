  "content": "Former champion Daniil Medvedev received a total fine of $42,500 by the U.S. Open on Wednesday for his public meltdown during a chaotic opening round defeat to Benjamin Bonzi.\n\nMedvedev, who won his only major title at the U.S. Open in 2021, lost 6-3 7-5 6-7(5) 0-6 6-4 defeat to Frenchman Bonzi on Sunday, but it was the Russian\u2019s third-set antics that made the headlines.\n\nThe 13th seed was facing match point and a defeat when a photographer interrupted Bonzi\u2019s serve by mistakenly walking onto the Louis Armstrong Stadium court.\n\nIn the wake of the bizarre incident, chair umpire Greg Allensworth awarded a new first serve instead of a second to Bonze, sparking Medvedev\u2019s public meltdown.\n\nRaging at the decision, the 29-year-old Medvedev sprinted across the court to remonstrate angrily with Allensworth and whipped up a jeering New York crowd. The match was delayed for more than six minutes before the crowd calmed down for Bonzi to resume.\n\nWith Bonzi clearly rattled, the Frenchman was unable to serve out as Medvedev fought back to force the contest into a deciding fifth set, only to lose the chaotic late night thriller in three hours and 45 minutes.\n\nImmediately after his defeat, Medvedev violently smashed a racket in frustration and sat dejectedly on his chair for several minutes before leaving the court.\n\nThe U.S. Open fined Medvedev $30,000 for unsportsmanlike conduct and $12,500 for obliterating the racket. The fines meant Russian would have to forfeit about 40% of the $11o,000 of the first-round prize money he received.\n\nThe 29-year-old Medvedev\u2019s defeat at Flushing Meadows in New York also meant he has won only one match at the Grand Slams all year, with that victory coming at the Australian Open in January.\n\nFollowing Daniil Medvedev\u2019s antics, his compatriot and childhood friend Andrey Rublev offered him help to deal with his emotions, while six-times Grand Slam champion Boris Becker said Medvedev should seek professional help.",

A fourth-round win will earn players $400,000, while the ultimate prize for lifting the title is $5 million.\nEarlier this month, the US Open announced that $90 million in prize money will be on offer, the largest purse in tennis history, up 20% from 2024.\nAryna Sabalenka is the defending women\u2019s champion at the US Open this year, while Jannik Sinner is the defending men\u2019s champion."

      "text": "Daniil Medvedev wrote another raucous chapter in his U.S. Open life story after a volley of histrionics during and after a first-round defeat to Benjamin Bonzi on Louis Armstrong Stadium. It was the first time the U.S. Open had started on a weekend. This was what that extra day was for in terms of fan engagement. Tennis was the sport, but the drama was box-set appeal.\nThe first half of Medvedev and Bonzi\u2019s match was a limp made-for-TV movie, but it suddenly burst into an all-action thriller with a horror ending. Medvedev\u2019s post-match racket destruction was a hard watch as he lost 3-6, 5-7, 7-6 (7-5), 6-0, 4-6.\nWhat threatened to be a meek, straight-sets exit for the 13th seed went full-metal crazy on match point down when Bonzi was interrupted from serving it out after a photographer absent-mindedly walked onto the court. Medvedev was incandescent when the umpire gave his opponent an extra serve because of the disruption.\nCue mayhem and a Medvedev tirade directed at chair umpire Greg Allensworth: \u201cAre you a man? Are you a man? Why are you shaking?\u201d the Russian vented as he stormed towards the chair. Medvedev has always promised that he would be himself on court and not pretend to thank anyone for the sake of likes. He has played to his tune, but here he performed a rogue Pied Piper parade that took the crowd on a journey with him.\nThe 2021 champion\u2019s relationship with spectators in New York has been as volatile as his temperament. In 2019, he regularly triggered the fans with celebrations and post-match comments that were designed to challenge the normal niceties. Medvedev is wired differently. The crowd understood by the time he lost to Rafael Nadal in the final.\nWhen his fuse threatened to blow completely here on the edge of elimination, the 29-year-old decided to holler for support. The six-and-a-half-minute stoppage that ensued clearly affected his opponent.\nIt worked a treat. All of that anger and frustration that Medvedev has held within as the train wreck of this season\u2019s slams hit the buffers, melted away as he stormed back to take the next two sets. This was competitive Medvedev, a man who has appeared in six slam finals and who probably should have won four of them.\nHaving bageled Bonzi 6-0 in the fourth set to tie things up, there was only one winner. Then the bounce of the match locked back into 50-50 mode, and those fine margins don\u2019t fall in favor of Medvedev this year when things get tight. It\u2019s as if he pulls it back to tease the idea of winning, only to lose the shootout.\nThree of his Grand Slam final losses were in the fifth set when he was two sets up. In 2025, he has been two sets down in all his five-set losses at the majors. That\u2019s a different kind of hurt.\nMedvedev is losing to the lesser man \u2013 in rankings terms, anyway. Cameron Norrie is a good player, but he was world No. 81 and was two sets up on Medvedev at Roland Garros before the natural order took over, and the latter took a grip of the match. Medvedev couldn\u2019t serve it out at 5-4 and lost. The frustration that was simmering threatened to explode there.\nAt the Australian Open, Medvedev showed his vulnerability again. He was two sets down to ATP Next Gen graduate Learner Tien, who was competitive midway through the match against Novak Djokovic on Sunday. The narrative was the same. A fightback was followed by eventual defeat and a whole raft of outbursts.\nHe started the year at world No. 5, but the heartbreak of defeats has done mortal damage to his mentality. Medevdev has always vocalized the venom inside. Now it\u2019s impinging on form.\nWhen he beat Djokovic in his only major title success at Flushing Meadows, Medvedev was transparent about how this beautiful sport turns ugly. \u201cTennis is a brutal sport because two persons are starting from the first round and only one can win - that\u2019s brutal, so, after the match I said sorry.\u201d\nFour years later, Medvedev can\u2019t get past the first round in slams. After beating Djokovic in New York, Medvedev did the \u2018dead fish\u2019 celebration that was well-known in the FIFA console game. After losing to Bonzi, his relevance as an internet meme isn\u2019t based on his tennis ability."
