  "content": "\u2022 Nexus Infrastructure's estimated fair value is UK\u00a31.48 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\n\u2022 With UK\u00a31.49 share price, Nexus Infrastructure appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value\n\u2022 Industry average of 27% suggests Nexus Infrastructure's peers are currently trading at a higher premium to fair value Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Nexus Infrastructure plc (LON:NEXS) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine. Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free. We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value: (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = UK\u00a35.8m\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.7%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 11%. Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= UK\u00a322m\u00f7 ( 1 + 11%)10= UK\u00a37.6m The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is UK\u00a313m. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of UK\u00a31.5, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Nexus Infrastructure as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 11%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.633. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\u2022 Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Construction market.\n\u2022 Expensive based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.\n\u2022 Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows. Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Nexus Infrastructure, there are three pertinent items you should explore:\n\u2022 Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 1 warning sign with Nexus Infrastructure , and understanding this should be part of your investment process.\n\u2022 Future Earnings: How does NEXS's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

  "argos_summary": "Nexus Infrastructure plc\u2019s 2\u2011stage DCF values the company at UK\u00a31.48 per share, based on a present value of \u00a35.8\u202fm of projected cash flows and \u00a37.6\u202fm of terminal value discounted at 11%.  The current share price of \u00a31.49 sits just above this fair value, implying a near\u2011flat valuation relative to the 27% industry premium.  The model uses a 5\u2011year government bond yield of 2.7% for the Gordon growth terminal and assumes a gradual slowdown in growth from the high\u2011growth first stage to a stable second stage.",
