  "content": "The White House opted against having former President Joe Biden board a vessel during a July 2023 visit to a Philadelphia shipyard after learning \u201clots of steps\u201d were required to get on board, newly released emails show.\n\nThe records, obtained by watchdog group Protect the Public\u2019s Trust via a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and first reported by Fox News, show Department of Transportation staffers attempting to gather information about Biden\u2019s July 20, 2023, trip to the Philly Shipyard and what the president would be doing during his visit.\n\nThe DOT\u2019s Maritime Administration (MARAD) had awarded the Philly Shipyard a contract to build a massive National Security Multi-Mission Vessel (NSMV) years earlier \u2013 but the agency learned days before Biden\u2019s trip that the White House would not allow the then-80-year-old president to inspect the boat.\n\n\u201cNo visit to the NSMV vessel is planned after the WH realized how many steps were involved to get on the ship,\u201d a MARAD official notified members of Office of the Secretary of Transportation (OST), quoting a contact the agency had at that shipyard.\n\n\u201cTrue \u2013 lots of steps on grating,\u201d the message continued in a parenthetical note.\n\nBiden\u2019s visit to the Philly Shipyard (PSI), where he met with apprentices and attended a steel-cutting ceremony for an offshore wind farm construction vessel, came just weeks after he took a hard fall at an Air Force Academy graduation ceremony in Colorado.\n\nSince the fall, the president had been observed boarding Air Force One using the aircraft\u2019s shorter set of stairs.\n\nSeven days before the Philadelphia shipyard visit, Biden stumbled on Air Force One\u2019s short staircase as prepared to depart Helsinki-Vantaan International Airport in Finland.\n\nThe White House\u2019s refusal to let Biden board the National Security Multi-Mission Vessel in Philadelphia may not have been the only time the president wasn\u2019t allowed to get on a boat over concerns about the number of steps involved.\n\nFormer British Prime Minister Boris Johnson claimed in his autobiography, \u201cUnleashed,\u201d that the White House would not allow Biden to board the British Navy\u2019s flagship aircraft carrier \u2013 the HMS Prince of Wales \u2013 ahead of the 2021 G7 summit in Cornwall.\n\n\u201cHis staff told us that he would not in fact be boarding our vast aircraft carrier \u2014 which we had proudly stationed in the bay \u2014 because it had so many steps; and we wondered what that meant about his physical fitness,\u201d Johnson said, according to an excerpt from the former prime minister\u2019s book obtained by The Telegraph.",

      "text": "Joe Biden takes hard fall at Air Force Academy commencement ceremony\nPresident Biden fell on stage Thursday after congratulating graduating cadets at the Air Force Academy in Colorado \u2014 drawing gasps from the crowd as onlookers rushed to help the commander-in-chief to his feet.\nAs the president got up, he pointed at a black sandbag on the stage, indicating that he had stumbled over the object.\nBiden, 80, fell as he finished shaking hands with graduates and giving out diplomas after his commencement address.\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the president was \u201ctotally fine\u201d as he boarded Air Force One for his return trip to Washington.\nBut Biden had another accident shortly after 7 p.m. as he \u201cbumped his head on the doorframe\u201d of his Marine One helicopter upon arrival at the White House, according to a pool report.\nBiden then told reporters \u201cI got sandbagged\u201d in reference to his fall.\nWhen reporters asked how he was feeling, Biden smiled and skipped once while walking toward the executive mansion.\nBiden is the oldest-ever president and is seeking a second term. He has tripped or stumbled at least four times before on the steps of Air Force One \u2014 drawing embarrassing coverage and comparisons to a high-profile 1975 incident involving then-President Gerald Ford.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, 44, wished Biden well after his tumble \u2014 before taking a shot at his leadership while on a campaign stop in New Hampshire.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if he sustained injuries, but I just want to say that we hope and wish Joe Biden a swift recovery from any injuries he may have sustained,\u201d he told supporters. \u201cBut we also wish the United States of America a swift recovery from the injuries sustained because of Joe Biden and his policies.\u201d\nDeSantis\u2019 2024 Republican rival, former President Trump, 76, responded to Biden\u2019s fall as he spoke to a crowd in Iowa, saying, \u201cHe actually fell down? Well, I hope he wasn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\nTrump appeared to commiserate with Biden and recalled his own treacherous walks as commander-in-chief.\n\u201cYou gotta be careful about that because you don\u2019t want that, even if you have to tip-toe down the ramp,\u201d said Trump, recalling a viral moment in June 2020 when he gingerly descended a ramp after delivering the commencement speech at the US Military Academy at West Point.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a bad place to fall,\u201d Trump later said of Biden\u2019s tumble. \u201cThat\u2019s not inspiring.\u201d\nOther conservatives were quick to react, with Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton tweeting: \u201cI hope President Biden is uninjured from this fall which dramatically and further illustrates his age-related cognitive and physical challenges.\u201d\nPublic figures not closely affiliated with Republican politics also expressed concern, with former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey writing, \u201cOpen the Democrat primaries and debates. This isn\u2019t fair to anyone.\u201d\nBiden allies, meanwhile, rallied around the boss.\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d White House communications director Ben LaBolt tweeted. \u201cThere was a sandbag on stage while he was shaking hands.\u201d\nThe president received a relatively clean bill of health in February following his annual physical, though a skin-cancer lesion was found and presidential physician Dr. Kevin O\u2019Connor noted Biden\u2019s \u201cspinal arthritis\u201d and stiff gait.\nBiden\u2019s \u201cgait remains stiff, but has not worsened since last year,\u201d O\u2019Connor wrote. \u201cAfter careful analysis\u2026 the team concluded that much of his stiffness is in fact a result of degenerative (\u2018wear and tear\u2019) osteoarthritic changes (or spondylosis) of his spine.\u201d\nIn a November 2021 report, O\u2019Connor wrote that he investigated Biden\u2019s \u201cperceptibly stiffer\u201d gait and attributed it to \u201c[a] combination of significant spinal arthritis, post-fracture \u2018limp and compensation\u2019 and a mild sensory peripheral neuropathy of the feet.\u201d\nBiden fractured his foot shortly after winning the 2020 election. He said it happened when he playfully tugged his then-dog Major\u2019s tail following a shower.\nBiden would be 86 if he completes a second four-year term and his age looms as a liability. A Washington Post-ABC poll released this month found that just 32% of the public believes Biden has the mental sharpness required to be president.\nThe president\u2019s mental acuity came under intense scrutiny in September of last year when he asked \u201cWhere\u2019s Jackie?\u201d and searched for the late Rep. Jackie Walorski (R-Ind.) despite publicly mourning her death and even calling her family to offer his condolences in August."

Come on!\u201d as she waved him over amid laughs from onlookers.\nJill Biden then took the president\u2019s hand and led him away.\nAnd a Sunday news conference at Cornwall Airport Newquay was marked by several Biden gaffes, including repeated references to the international COVAX vaccine distribution program as \u201cCOVID\u201d \u2014 which the White House corrected, using brackets, in its official transcript of the event.\nBiden also mixed up Syria and Libya three times during the news conference, including when he said, \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that we can find an accommodation where we can save the lives of people in, for example, in Libya,\u201d Fox News reported.\nAnd during a Q&A session with reporters, Biden admitted that \u201cI\u2019m going to get in trouble with staff\u201d if he strayed from instructions that directed him to give the first question to Jonathan Lemire of the Associated Press, a frequent guest on liberal cable news network MSNBC.\n\u201cNow, why don\u2019t I take some of your questions? And I\u2019m told, Jonathan, I\u2019m supposed to talk \u2014 recognize you first,\u201d Biden said."

      "text": "Inside the enormous Biden effort to \u2018debank\u2019 Trump after Jan. 6\nThe scale of the effort to \u201cdebank\u201d Donald Trump because of pressure from Biden administration regulators went far beyond JPMorgan and Bank of America, The Post has learned.\nAt least 10 other financial institutions closed their windows to the billionaire real estate tycoon over his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol Hill melee.\nThe moves came in the months after Trump left the White House in 2021, sources inside the Trump Organization told me.\nThe stunning scale of the blacklisting is being revealed here for the first time.\nIt should be reported as much as possible for the simple reason that if any big bank can cancel a former president over politics as opposed to illegality, then every American citizen is in danger of facing the same mistreatment.\nFor expressing an opinion, or starting a business out of step with the progressive culture norms that have infected so much of society, you too can see your economic livelihood go up in smoke and \u201cdebanked.\u201d\nDebanking is such an odd word for one of the most insidious parts of cancel culture, and its sponsors like it that way.\nIt sanitizes, via clumsy, obtuse lingo, what is essentially something of dangerous Orwellian magnitude: negating an American citizen\u2019s ability to save, and conduct business through a big bank.\nThat\u2019s why Trump and Republicans like South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott are taking steps to end the politicization of banking.\nKeep in mind, there are already laws preventing the likes of JPMorgan, BofA and Capital One \u2014 the banks Trump has publicly stated canceled him \u2014 from being conduits for drug kingpins and Mafiosi.\n(Trump has sued Capital One, which denied Trump\u2019s allegations.)\nDebanking takes it further. It forces banks to remove customers who might pose nothing more than \u201creputational risk,\u201d a flighty rule enforced by bank regulators in recent years to keep financial institutions from doing business with people like Jeffrey Epstein.\nThe now-deceased convicted child sex predator was a JPMorgan customer for years, and in theory making it impossible for Epstein to finance his illegality sounds like what should be happening.\nThat is until you dig deeper.\nUnder pressure from the Biden administration, just after Trump lost the 2020 election and started to act out (which the last time I checked was his constitutional right), the enforcement of reputational risk took a decidedly political turn, bank officials tell me.\nIf you believe people at the two largest banks, Jamie Dimon\u2019s JPMorgan and Brian Moynihan\u2019s BofA, the Biden administration unleashed its bank regulatory cops at the Office of Comptroller of Currency, the FDIC and the semi-independent Federal Reserve to go beyond nixing perverted financiers from their platform.\nThey used the amorphous nature of what is reputational risk to enforce a political regime, the bank officials said.\nThe Bidenistas hated crypto, thought it was an affront to their power to control the economy, and pressured banks from doing business with this somewhat heterodox emerging industry, according to the bank sources.\nSo was anything related to guns and certain conservative religious organizations, they added.\nAnd most of all, anything MAGA, including the multibillion-dollar real estate and resort empire of Mr. MAGA himself, Donald J. Trump.\nSuch an effort isn\u2019t easy to prove because there\u2019s no direct smoking gun, no memo (at least not yet) telling banks to cancel Trump from their system.\nThe banks say the pressure was more subtle but still real: Failure to remove Trump or crypto types and others would result in heightened enforcement, harassment and possibly fines.\nThe banks decided to drop customers, even rich ones like Trump, because it wasn\u2019t worth the hassle.\nI have covered finance for three decades now and thought I saw it all: Bernie Madoff, Epstein, the 2008 financial crisis, Wall Street scandals, penny stock scams and hedge fund implosions.\nBut what happened to Trump in 2021 was truly surprising given the breadth of big banks dropping him as a client and scary given their rationale.\nAs bad as the events of Jan. 6 were, Trump did tell the crowd that crazy afternoon to protest peacefully.\nTrump didn\u2019t break the law holding a rally.\nYou may disagree with his rhetoric that day.\nHe had just lost a closely fought election against Joe Biden.\nTrump said he really won it.\nMillions of people seemed to agree.\nHe wouldn\u2019t be the first politician to pull that lever. Democrat Stacey Abrams never really fully conceded when she lost in her first attempt to become governor of Georgia against Republican Brian Kemp.\nHow many times did Hillary Clinton say Trump was an \u201cillegitimate president\u201d after she lost the 2016 contest to him?\nDuring the violent social justice protests of 2020, Gwen Walz, the wife of Minnesota Gov. and 2024 Democrat VP candidate Tim Walz, said she \u201ckept the windows\u201d open to smell the burning debris.\n\u201cI felt like that was such a touchstone of what was happening,\u201d she said.\nOr how about what Kamala Harris proudly said around the same time.\nThe then-Biden VP candidate, who went on to get trounced by Trump in 2024, supported the defunding of the police movement that led to much more mayhem than what occurred on Jan. 6.\nHer rationale for the \u201clargely peaceful protests\u201d that burned cities to the ground, delivered to fellow-traveler lefty late-night host Stephen Colbert, is at least as cringey as anything Trump said on Jan. 6.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to stop,\u201d she said during an appearance on the show.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not. This is a movement. I\u2019m telling you. They\u2019re not going to stop, and everyone, beware . . . That they\u2019re not going to let up. And they should not, and we should not.\u201d\nDid Jamie Dimon tell Harris that her money isn\u2019t good at JPM?"

      "text": "Howard Stern staffers prepping for show\u2019s demise, withholding best material as future uncertain\nThe writing has \u201cbeen on the wall for well over a year now\u201d that SiriusXM wouldn\u2019t be renewing Howard Stern\u2019s colossal contract \u2014 and his employees have been taking advantage, \u201ccoasting\u201d on the clock and trolling for new gigs, two current show staffers told The Post.\nThis week, reports surfaced that the \u201cHoward Stern Show\u2019s\u201d \u201c19-year run at SiriusXM was nearing its end, with his $500 million contract expiring at the end of the year and an audience that\u2019s apparently dwindled from 20 million a day to 125,000.\nSome of the show\u2019s writers have been their best jokes for themselves, to use after the show\u2019s eventual demise, one worker said.\n\u201cMost of us have been coasting at work the last year,\u201d because \u201cwe know he\u2019s retiring, whether by choice or because he\u2019s forced out,\u201d admitted one of the longtime staffers who dished to The Post this week.\nStern\u2019s employees have been putting out feelers for other showbiz gigs, the two said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been hard, because the industry [in New York City] is so incestuous, so you don\u2019t know who\u2019s talking to who,\u201d the first employee said.\n\u201cI\u2019m just hanging in there until this is all sorted out, and then I will take some time to unwind after all this,\u201d the staffer continued. \u201cI\u2019m a fan and it\u2019s been a big part of my life for so long, but it hasn\u2019t been fun for a while.\u201d\nBefore taking his annual summer break, Stern, 71, hinted in staff meetings his retirement is nigh. The staffers said they\u2019ve only heard rumors regarding Stern\u2019s future at SiriusXM \u2014 nothing definitive from management or the self-proclaimed \u201cKing of All Media\u201d himself.\nThe looming end of the once mighty radio personality comes after a sharp change in Stern\u2019s politics.\nThe radio host used to maintain a friendship with President Trump, but came out against him when he ran against Hillary Clinton in 2015.\nOnce a strong supporter of Republicans like former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Governor George Pataki, Stern has been accused of going woke and was an infamously ardent backer of President Biden and Kamala Harris.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if its wokeness that alienated some of his audience, or if he just got tamer with age, but whatever it is, its apparent no one wants to hear it anymore,\u201d the second staffer offered.\nThe political U-turn was done to appease the Hollywood elite, the employee said.\n\u201cI think he\u2019s content to be out in there in the Hamptons with his celebrity friends,\u201d the first staffer offered. \u201cHe likes being liked by famous people. That seems more important [to him] than his legacy.\u201d\nSome ribbed Stern, calling him \u201cHollywood Howie\u201d after he started hanging around with the likes of Jimmy Kimmel, Jennifer Aniston, Jerry Seinfeld, and John Stamos during the late 2000s and early to mid 2010s.\nBut since COVID Stern\u2019s become \u201ca hermit,\u201d the second staffer said.\n\u201cEveryone knows he hasn\u2019t been the same since COVID. He does the show from his [Southampton] basement. And it\u2019s been sad to see how irrelevant he\u2019s become,\u201d the employee added.\nStern has also suffered immense loss in recent years, with the deaths of his father, Ben, in 2022, his best friend and stylist, Ralph Cirella, in 2023, and then his agent, Don Buchwald, in 2024.\nFans have complained for years about the show\u2019s dwindling quality, and Stern\u2019s kids-gloves approach with certain guests he once would\u2019ve skewered.\n\u201cHis passion hasn\u2019t been there, and that can be infectious,\u201d the first staffer said. \u201cWhen your boss doesn\u2019t even seem like he wants to be there, its like, why should I bust my ass?\u201d\nStern and SiriusXM did not return requests for comment.\nAccording to a DailyMail report, Stern might make a move to a streaming platform, like Netflix or HBO Max, and insists \u201cAll this unknown is music to Howard\u2019s ears.\n\u201cHe thrives in this element of the unknown,\u201d the source added."

      "text": "FIRST ON FOX: Unearthed emails as part of a FOIA request show Biden administration agencies scrapping a plan to visit a vessel at an event because it would have required then-President Joe Biden to take too many steps.\nRecords show, as part of a FOIA request by Protect the Public\u2019s Trust obtained by Fox News Digital, that Biden was set to visit a National Security Multi-Mission Vessel (NSMV) while touring a Philadelphia shipyard in July 2023.\nHowever, according to the emails, that visit to the vessel was scrapped because of \"how many steps were involved to get on the ship.\"\nThe emails show that the U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD) was engaged in a major project at the Philadelphia shipyard at the time that Biden was planning to visit to tout offshore wind and clean energy jobs.\nA MARAD official emailed members of the Office of Secure Transportation, with the Department of Transportation cc\u2019d, on July 17, 2023, that said, \"No visit to the NSMV vessel is planned after the WH realized how many steps were involved to get on the ship. {True \u2013 lots of steps on grating}.\"\nThe email exchanges also show a lack of coordination between the White House and MARAD, an agency of the DOT, as the next day an email between DOT officials said, \"MARAD hasn\u2019t had anyone reach out to them from WH. All info they have received has been from Philly shipyard. S2 team reached out to WH Advance, and that is how we confirmed the visit was scheduled. Nothing else heard and no further call made or received on this event that I am aware of.\"\nThe decision to skip visiting the vessel in the shipyard came a little more than a month after Biden faced questions over his mental and physical sharpness when he stumbled and fell on stage at an Air Force Academy graduation ceremony in Colorado Springs, Colorado, on June 1, 2023.\nThe White House said at the time that the president tripped over a sandbag and that he was not injured by the fall.\nAround the same time, White House officials were rejecting concerns from conservatives about Biden\u2019s health and insisting he was able to perform his duties at a high level.\nRoughly a week after the event in Philadelphia, then-White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre bristled at a question about Biden\u2019s age and whether the White House could assure people there was nothing to be concerned about by outlining the president\u2019s accomplishments.\n\"Look, we\u2019ve been asked this question multiple times,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"And you have a president who \u2014 I just went through his Unity Agenda \u2014 what we\u2019ve been able to do in a bipartisan way as it relates to issues that really matter to the American people \u2014 right? \u2014 the Cancer Moonshot, which is actually going to make a difference with people and family \u2014 fam- \u2014 Americans who have family members dealing with cancer. That is something that this president has been able to do.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nFox News Digital reached out to Biden\u2019s office and the Philadelphia shipyard for comment.\n\"There's an awful lot wrong here, beginning with the White House planning a presidential visit to one of the most important shipyards in the nation without bothering to give a heads-up to the Department of Transportation, which has major ongoing projects there,\" Protect the Public\u2019s Trust Director Michael Chamberlain told Fox News Digital.\n\"That's amateurish. Second and far more critical, the president's staff was proscribing events he couldn't physically handle more than a year before he dropped out of the re-election race, all while lambasting anyone who claimed he wasn't fit enough to complete the Ironman Competition. I realize there's an elevator down to the White House Situation Room, but most voters would like to think they're pulling the lever for a president who could take the stairs in an emergency.\"\nA former Biden aide pushed back on that narrative, saying that it is \"ironic that an organization called 'Protect the Public Trust' is more interested in how many steps the former president took than the current president's cost-raising agenda and close relationship with Jeffrey Epstein.\"\n\"The group is presenting a deceptive story with this 'don't look at Epstein' bait based on a single email with no context and they know it.\"\nA former Biden administration official reached by Fox News Digital referenced the massive size of the shipyard and that the size would be considered when planning events like this, adding that the email references steps and not stairs specifically.\nThe former official also pushed back on the person sending the email not having spoken directly with someone at the White House and explained that several teams are involved in arranging events like the one at the shipyard, considering accessibility, security risks, visuals and other factors."
