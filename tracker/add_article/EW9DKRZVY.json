      "title": "Indiana Fever host Washington Mystics on Friday: TV channel, time, how to watch",
      "summary": "The Indiana Fever (18‑15) and Washington Mystics (14‑18) face a must‑win matchup on Friday, with both teams battling injuries and recent losing streaks. Fever are missing key guard Caitlin Clark and have lost two other guards to season‑ending injuries, while the Mystics are out of the playoff picture after five losses in six games. Fever recently lost 81‑80 to the Dallas Wings after a late comeback, and coach Stephanie White criticized officiating. Mystics have relied on rookie rebound leader Kiki Iriafen and scorer Sonia Citron, but still sit in 10th place. The game will be played at Gainbridge Fieldhouse at 7:30 p.m. ET and is a critical opportunity for both teams to improve their standings.",
