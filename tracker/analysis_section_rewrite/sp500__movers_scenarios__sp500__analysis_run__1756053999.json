      "feedback": "The draft shows a solid macro-to-Ford causal scaffold but the regime logic and market transmission aren’t tightly anchored to Ford’s own numbers and the explicit triggers in the sources; tighten the chain to a clean, first-principles sequence: macro demand → Ford unit volumes → fixed-cost/EV capex → EV EBIT margins → ROIC vs WACC → valuation, and map Expansion/Normalization/Downturn to explicit, source-backed triggers (e.g., two consecutive EV EBIT breakeven quarters plus a paced EV capex path as the gating condition; progressing toward Model E profitability with cash flow headroom; or widening EV losses with ROIC declines under persistent demand/tariff stress). Sharpen Ford-centric focus by pruning cross-topic noise (AI, Disney, Costa, Coca‑Cola) from the four lines or segregating them clearly, and by making all numeric claims traceable to the IDs (e.g., $1.3B Q2 EV loss; adj. margin ≈4.3%; ROIC ≈10%; $50B EV spend through 2026 with pause on up to $12B; forward P/E ≈10x; yield ≈5%) with exact citations (22PL3Q360)(W2622L6WW)(65UUBU0OR). For the four-line Up/Down outputs, require: two Up lines tied to 2–3 years and 3–5+ years horizons with crisp catalysts (two consecutive EV breakeven quarters and capex pacing for Up; sustained EV profitability and ROIC versus WACC normalization for the longer horizon), and two Down lines tied to 2–3 years and 0–12 months with clear invalidation signals (persistent EV losses widening beyond a threshold, tariff/policy shocks); insist every line uses a single sentence, concrete watch items (e.g., quarterly EV profitability prints, cadence of capex, tariff developments, ROIC vs WACC gaps) and probabilities grounded in the material (avoid introducing unsupported numeric probabilities). Finally, ensure high-density citation when asserting facts or numbers and reconcile any conflicts (e.g., regime anchors and timing) across the cited IDs (22PL3Q360)(W2622L6WW)(65UUBU0OR).",
