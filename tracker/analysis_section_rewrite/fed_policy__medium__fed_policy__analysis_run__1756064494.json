      "feedback": "Strong base to build on (Q2 revenue $215m; 2025 guidance $850–$950m; gross margin ~49%, net margin ~13–14%; earnings growth ~37%/yr; price around $30.5 vs consensus $34.76; ACMR’s N2 bubbling upgrade). To reach world-class, tighten to a precise 3–6 month horizon and convert the current narrative into a formal, or‑clear catalyst map: explicit triggers, timing windows, and invalidation rules linked to sources (C22MKA9VY for Fed cuts and policy stance; SK994CBWR for Q2 results, margin, and consensus targets). Remove the long‑horizon $1.4B/2028 thesis and instead anchor near‑term paths to the 2025 guidance and 2025E revenue cadence; quantify near‑term price impact from macro moves (e.g., how a Fed‑cut path described in C22MKA9VY shifts ACMR’s multiple) and tie to a base case plus 1–2 alternates with clear outcomes. Add explicit invalidation signals: if the Fed delays or scales back cuts beyond the outlined window, if labor data disappoints inflation/PMI signals, or if export‑controls/Taiwan/China tensions escalate and constrain WFE CapEx. Build a concise near‑term valuation path: baseline upside to the consensus target (~13–14% from $30.5 to $34.8) with a qualitative range for “macro‑driven” multiple expansion vs. “execution/mabate” scenarios; specify timing (e.g., 1H of next quarters) and path‑dependence (rate‑cut timetable governs discount rates and capex mood). Ensure clean citation discipline (after each factual claim cite SK994CBWR for ACMR data and C22MKA9VY for Fed‑policy signals), remove duplicated article entries, and present as: one crisp thesis; a Catalyst/Trigger map with windows; near‑term price/volume trajectories; 1–2 alts; watch‑list signals; and a concise confidence rating.",
