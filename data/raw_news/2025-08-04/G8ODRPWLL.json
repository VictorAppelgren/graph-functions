  "title": "AI for President? Here's why, as an AI expert, I think it could happen by 2032",
  "description": "Why AI governance is not as far-fetched as one might think",
  "content": "It sounds like science fiction: \u201cCould AI run for president?\u201d But as someone who\u2019s spent decades building software systems that prevent failure in high-stakes environments, I believe we\u2019re approaching a moment when this question won\u2019t sound ridiculous\u2014it will sound inevitable.\n\nBy 2032, AI tools won\u2019t just be answering our questions or drafting our emails. It will be deeply embedded in the systems that shape our lives: our healthcare, our education, our justice systems\u2014and yes, even our governance. I\u2019m not saying we\u2019ll elect a robot to office. But I am saying that an AI might be the most impartial, consistent, and evidence-driven decision-maker in the room.\n\nWhat Software Taught Me About Broken Systems\n\nBuilding software that anticipates failure taught me to look beyond surface-level issues and ask what\u2019s really driving breakdowns\u2014whether in code or in government. That\u2019s what data and AI do best: find meaning in complexity.\n\nAround 2019, I began to notice a deeply unsettling pattern\u2014one that had nothing to do with code. Public trust in governments was collapsing. Democracies were paralyzed by short-term incentives, disinformation, and gridlock. Meanwhile, leadership decisions were increasingly detached from facts, drowning in emotion and noise.\n\nI found myself asking the kind of question that gets you strange looks at dinner parties: What if AI could help us govern better than we govern ourselves?\n\nAI Isn\u2019t Perfect\u2014But Neither Are We\n\nWhen people talk about AI, they usually split into two camps: utopians who believe it will save us, and doomsayers who fear it will destroy us. But I\u2019ve worked closely with AI systems. I know what they can do\u2014and what they can\u2019t.\n\nAI doesn\u2019t have desires. It doesn\u2019t seek power. It doesn\u2019t fear losing elections or gaining popularity. It doesn\u2019t lie to protect its ego.\n\nThat\u2019s not just a limitation. It\u2019s also a strength.\n\nHumans bring empathy, values, and creativity\u2014but also bias, ego, and self-interest. AI, when designed ethically and transparently, brings clarity, consistency, and impartiality. It can help us make data-driven decisions that aren\u2019t held hostage by emotion or lobbyists.\n\nThe realization hit me hard: for decades I\u2019ve used technology to reduce failure in software. Couldn\u2019t we use the same thinking to reduce failure in leadership?\n\nI started imagining a governance model where AI doesn\u2019t replace politicians\u2014but augments them. A system where AI:\n\n- Predicts the impact of policy across different demographics.\n\nIn short, AI wouldn\u2019t run the world. It would help us run it better.\n\nThat\u2019s why I coined the term AICracy\u2014a system where AI assists governance with transparency and ethical guardrails, proposing evidence-based ideas for human leaders to shape, debate, and vote on. It\u2019s not automation of politics. It\u2019s optimization of decision-making.\n\nWhat I\u2019ve Learned\u2014and What You Can Take Away\n\nOver the years, I\u2019ve come to believe that AI won\u2019t undermine leadership\u2014it will elevate it, if we let it. Here are a few principles I live by:\n\n1) AI is only as good as the humans guiding it\n\nLike steel, AI can build bridges or swords. It\u2019s up to us to embed values, ethics, and context into the system.\n\n2) Don\u2019t see AI as a competitor\u2014see it as an amplifier\n\nIt won\u2019t replace human intuition. But it can scale clarity and reduce noise in overwhelmed systems.\n\n3) Fairness is a systems challenge, not just a moral one\n\nAI can analyze patterns of inequality and help us intervene\u2014if we\u2019re bold enough to use it.\n\n4) AI can\u2019t make moral decisions\u2014but it can support more moral systems\n\nHuman oversight is critical. The goal isn\u2019t to escape responsibility, but to deepen it\u2014with better tools.\n\nOut of curiosity, I recently asked ChatGPT and Gemini how they envision themselves evolving by 2032. Their answers startled me\u2014not because they were outlandish, but because they aligned with what I already suspected:\n\nBy then, AI will be more transparent, accountable, and aligned with human values. It will help governments, companies, and communities reason across massive complexity in real time. It won\u2019t just provide answers\u2014it will become a collaborator in solving society\u2019s hardest problems.\n\nIt will be: \u201cWhy would we keep governing without it?\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re not electing an AI president\u2014yet. But by 2032, we may trust one to help us decide how to govern better. That, to me, is not far-fetched. It\u2019s necessary.\n\nWe list the best AI chatbot for business .\n\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

      "text": "Best AI chatbot for business of 2025\nSupport your customers with AI\nWe list the best AI chatbots for business, to make it simple and easy to provide online support for customers and staff using AI chatbots.\nArtificial intelligence is one of the greatest technological developments of this century. You may have heard of ChatGPT, the famous artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI, an American software company. ChatGPT was released in November 2022 and amassed millions of users in a short while. It\u2019s arguably the most famous AI product, but many chatbots have existed before it, including those built for businesses.\nAI chatbots are an innovative customer support solution for businesses. They don\u2019t replace human support but instead, help solve simple issues, while human support representatives focus on the more complex issues.\nThere are many AI chatbot platforms you can adopt for your business. These platforms take away the stress involved in setting up your chatbot to interact with customers. They take care of the complex technical aspects of running a chatbot, while you focus on the simpler things. They save a lot of money compared to hiring developers to train and build your own chatbot.\nWe tested different AI chatbot platforms to identify the best ones for businesses. We considered essential factors including speed, scalability, third-party integrations, and ease of use. They each have their pros and cons but, overall, are the best chatbots you can adopt for your business.\nWe also listed the best live chat software.\nThe best AI chatbot for business of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest AI chatbot for ease of use\n1. Botsify\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBotsify is another simple-to-use AI chatbot platform. Its main proposition is for businesses to build customer support bots or bots to automate their sales processes. This platform supports translation to over 100 languages, so you can create bots to interact with customers from all across the globe.\nYou can embed the chatbots you create via Botsify on your website or connect them to your Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, or Telegram business account. You can display call-to-action buttons within the bots to convert users into paying customers; remember that making a purchase as seamless as possible will help boost your revenue.\nYou can collect contact information via your bots and automatically store them. You can let customers book meetings and purchase products via the bots. There are endless applications.\nBotsify is relatively affordable. It starts at $49 per month for unlimited conversations but with a limit of 5k users. A higher plan costs $149 per month and supports unlimited users and conversations. There\u2019s no free version, but you can take advantage of the 14-day free trial to test Botsify\u2019s features before making your final decision.\nBest AI chatbot for customer support\n2. Intercom\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIntercom is a software company specializing in customer support and business messaging tools. One of its main products is a tool that lets businesses develop chatbots powered by artificial intelligence.\nYou can use Intercom's chatbot tool to develop bots without writing a single line of code. Intercom is a customer support platform, so the main use case for its chatbot tool is building customer support bots. You can define keywords and automatic responses for the bots to give to customers. This platform incorporates artificial intelligence, so it speaks in a conversational tone that customers would like.\nSimilarly, you can use Intercom bots to interact with potential customers and collect lead information from them. This platform lets you automate simple business conversations and frees up time to focus on the more complex ones.\nIntercom's pricing strategy isn't straightforward. The price you'll pay depends on several factors including the number of chatbots and the volume of conversations. Customer reviews often note that the platform is expensive.\nBest AI chatbot for social media\n3. Chatfuel\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nChatfuel is an AI chatbot platform with a simple proposition; build bots to interact with customers and embed them on your website or social media pages. The platform gives you a collection of pre-built chatbot templates that you can use as the foundation for yours. You can find templates across different categories; real estate, restaurant, e-commerce, healthcare, beauty, etc.\nYou can pick any template and edit it to fit your tastes. If you have the time and skills, you\u2019re free to create your own chatbot from scratch on Chatfuel.\nChatfuel lets you create chatbots via a graphical user interface instead of codes. You can define keywords for questions you expect your customer to ask and provide automated answers. If your bot notices the keywords, then it\u2019ll reply just the way you instructed it to. If the bot doesn\u2019t understand the question, it can forward the message to a human to take it further.\nAfter creating a Chatfuel bot, you can embed it on your website. Alternatively, you can connect it to your Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp business pages, and customers can interact with the bot on these platforms.\nChatfuel is relatively affordable, with plans starting from $15 per month for 500 conversations.\nBest AI chatbot for WhatsApp\n4. Landbot\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLandbot offers a no-code chatbot builder that anyone can use. You can create bots without writing code but, instead, use conditional logic. Landbot already gives you a collection of pre-built templates that you can edit to create your chatbot. These templates take away a lot of the stress that would come from creating your own bot from scratch.\nYou can deploy your Landbot chatbot on your website or WhatsApp business page. Landbot has extensive integration with WhatsApp, making it easy for customers to converse with your business on the messaging platform they know best. It supports over 60 languages, so you can connect with customers across the globe.\nLandbot doesn\u2019t have integration with other social platforms apart from WhatsApp, which puts it at a disadvantage. We also observed complaints of the company\u2019s customer support being lax and needing improvement.\nBest AI chatbot for advanced features\n5. Kore.ai\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nKore.ai is a popular conversational AI platform. It gives businesses a platform to build advanced chatbots to interact with customers. The Kore.ai bot builder lets you build chatbots via a graphical user interface instead of codes that only people with advanced technical skills can understand.\nYou can build your custom virtual assistant via a drag-and-drop interface as if you're using a website builder. Kore.ai has a built-in conversation designer that enables your chatbot to mimic human-like tones. It generates automated replies based on previous conversations, and you can make final tweaks before deploying the chatbot. During development, you can always test your chatbot via a mock screen to see how it'll work with end users.\nYou can brand your virtual assistant to make it look professional. You can add your logos and images and change the design to fit the colors of your brand.\nA drawback of using this platform is its high costs. It starts at 20 cents per conversation, plus 10 cents per conversation for pre-built apps, and 4 cents per minute for voice automation. This can add up to a significant amount if you have many customers that\u2019ll need support at some point.\nWe've listed the best help desk software.\nBest AI chatbot for business FAQs\nHow to choose an AI chatbot\nCost\nCost is the first consideration when adopting any software. High-quality AI chatbots aren\u2019t usually cheap but you can shop for the most affordable solution depending on your budget. This ensures you don\u2019t run into future pricing problems that\u2019ll disrupt your business.\nChannel support\nWhat channels does your AI chatbot support? Most chatbots will be embeddable on your website, but that\u2019s not the only needed channel. How about your social media pages? Does it integrate with Facebook, Telegram, Twitter, and other popular social media platforms? Does it integrate with SMS? A good chatbot should support many communication channels.\nEase of use\nIt should be easy to navigate the platform when building your chatbot. It should have an interactive web-based tool for designing and setting parameters for the chatbot. If you're not satisfied with what you've created, you should be able to restart the development process and build on previously developed components.\nSpeed (response time)\nWe can\u2019t overstate the importance of response time for a chatbot. Customers don\u2019t have time to waste, so your chatbot must respond to them as quickly as possible. It shouldn\u2019t just respond quickly in vain but should provide relevant answers to their questions.\nWhat are the essential features of an AI chatbot?\nConversational tone\nThe chatbot should speak in a conversational tone with users. It should sound as human-like as possible instead of a robot giving bland answers. A conversational tone encourages people to continue communicating with the chatbot to get their needed answers instead of requesting human support immediately.\nAccuracy\nThe chatbot should give accurate information when prompted. Giving wrong answers will make your customers frustrated and abandon the conversation. Ideally, the chatbot should recognize when it can\u2019t provide an accurate answer to questions and forward the conversation to a human support representative who can do that.\nAnalytics\nYou should be able to analyze how customers are interacting with the chatbot and identify what needs improvements. What is the most popular question? What topics did users engage with that made them frequently ask for a human agent? What percentage of people interact with the bot from their PC or mobile? Etc.\nThird-party integration\nThe bot should have integrations with third-party enterprise software tools. For example, you can integrate your bot with the Microsoft Teams video-conferencing software to enable people to interact with it while on calls or integrate the bot with Slack so that people can talk to it within the app.\nHow we tested the best AI chatbot for business\nTo test for the best AI chatbot for business we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, then we tested the service to see how the chatbot could be used in a range of different situations. The aim was to push each AI chatbot to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced options.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best small business software of 2025\nMake work easier to do\nWe list the best small business software, to make it simple and easy to work better and more effectively.\nWhile there are obvious basics, such as productivity suites and accounting software, it's always good to have a general idea of what different types of software are out there, so that the moment you identify a need, you can identify a solution. This is especially the case when you start to grow and find yourself wanting to communicate and collaborate with new employees, customers, or suppliers.\nLuckily, there is a lot of competition online in the business software market, and while there are big name products priced for big name clients, there are always smaller and cheaper packages which can be just as good. The challenge is to find not just the type you need, but the one that comes in at the right price for you.\nHowever, even some of the more seemingly expensive software suites sometimes have a free tier, so you can try it out and see if it works for you - and if it does, you can grow into the software as your business cashflow improves.\nEven better is that sometimes there are free alternatives to paid-for brand name suites, though often it's the case that you get what you pay for, and cheap or free can come with limitations.\nWe'll therefore look to list a wide range of software types that it's good to be familiar with, and feature the best on the market, so that should you develop a need for anything in particular, you already have an idea of what to look for.\nHere are the best small business software solutions currently available.\nYour Business All-in-One. Email, Docs, Storage & AI in a Single Suite. Get Google Workspace Today and save 15% on Starter, Standard and Plus for 12 months (Flex & Commit).\nWe\u2019ve also picked out the best small business web hosting.\nThe best small business software of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest small business software: Best office software\nReasons to buy\nThere are many rivals, but Microsoft still provides the best office software suite, and Microsoft 365 delivers a cloud version you can use on the go as well as at home or in the office. This makes it the workhorse of many businesses of every size, from sole traders to enterprises.\nThe first thing going for Microsoft 365 is its familiarity - if you've used Microsoft Office before you'll easily find your way around this platform. Even if you haven't and have used rivals instead the same still applies because Microsoft Office is the market leader that others attempt to copy.\nThe second is that Microsoft 365 works in the cloud, which offers several advantages, the first being that you can use it on the go with your smartphone or tablet, but the second being that all your documents are saved online in the cloud with OneDrive. This means you don't have to worry about losing important files to a hard drive crash, and also that you can switch between devices without losing your work.\nPricing can seem a little more expensive than it used to be for buying a standalone license for Microsoft 365 Personal, which provides you with Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Publisher, and Access, with online emails served by Outlook, and OneDrive for cloud storage of documents.\nThere's also Microsoft 365 Home which offers up to six licenses which could be ideal and cost-efficient for distributing around employees if you have five or less. Microsoft 365 Business Premium is targeted at larger businesses and includes Sharepoint, Microsoft Exchange, and Microsoft Teams.\nAltogether, Microsoft 365 delivers what you need in terms of an office software and admin platform, and remains superior in terms of functionality than rivals. Additionally, expect to find many suppliers and contractors also using it, making it easy to share, swap, or send send files between your both without any problems.\nRead our full Microsoft 365 review.\nBest small business software: Best for communications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBelieve the hype, or at least part of it \u2013 Slack may not have killed off email just yet, and it can turn into a time sink if you're not disciplined in how it's deployed, but it's also fair to say that this communications platform has helped transform the way that a lot of small business teams keep in touch.\nLike all the best software tools, the basic idea is very simple: real-time messaging in web browsers, mobile apps, and desktop clients. Team members can chat one to one, or in groups, or in channels based around topics (sales, finances, products and so on).\nWhat Slack does well though is bring that simple idea to life very intuitively, with a slick and responsive interface, and a host of integrations, plug-ins and shortcuts to keep the conversation flowing. All the functions you think you might need, from file transfers to video calling, are right there for you.\nYou don't get much out of Slack for free but it gives you a feel for the app, and should be fine for smaller teams. At the highest pricing tier, you get round-the-clock support and a guaranteed support response time of four hours, as well as unlimited message archives.\nRead our full Slack review.\nBest small business software: Best project management software\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGot both a team and multiple projects to manage? Asana helps you work out who should be doing what at any given moment, maximizing the chances of everything coming together on deadline (though you do need a certain amount of talent and hard work from your staff as well, of course).\nAs with the other software tools in this list, it's not just the features that Asana has that make it special \u2013 it's the way those features are wrapped up in an elegant and accessible interface that's easy to navigate around and works across mobile apps and the web without missing a beat.\nWe also like the way Asana integrates very well with more than a hundred other products and services. All the big names are included \u2013 Dropbox, Slack, Gmail, Salesforce and so on \u2013 and this means Asana is flexible enough to fit right into whatever workflow you've got set up at the moment (or want to try in the future).\nWhether you're mapping out the steps in a project, assigning duties and responsibilities, checking on the current status of a plan or trying to get a 'big picture' look at exactly what's happening at any given moment, Asana makes the process much more straightforward than you might expect.\nRead our full Asana review.\nBest small business software: Best sales and marketing app\nReasons to buy\nHubspot is a platform that provides a range of tools for content management, sales and marketing, and social media advertising. Hubspot goes way beyond simply setting up a website and editing its content, as much as delivering a wide-ranging toolkit to help improve conversions, and ranks as our top pick for best content marketing tools as well as features in our best CRM software.\nIt does this by offering options for split testing, content hosting, communications within a sales team and with customers, along with goals and targets that can be tracked using Hubspot's analytics software.\nThere are also a number of additional integrations available, not least Salesforce, Google Workspace, and Microsoft 365.\nAll in all, Hubspot probably isn't the best at any individual feature that it offers, but the comprehensive set that it does offer makes it a clear market leader, and the best at what it does.\nEven better, there's a free tier for trying out Hubspot.\nRead our full HubSpot review.\nBest small business software: Best accounting software\nReasons to buy\nSage Accounting makes a good first impression with its clear and gimmick-free pricing. The top Sage Accounting plan offers decent value and there is also a 30-day free trial.\nFor this, you get modules to manage quotes, invoices, handle and submit tax online, smart bank feeds and reconciliation, cash flow forecasting, some detailed reports, multiple currency support, project tracking and more, all available from your desktop or via a mobile app.\nAll this is well presented and generally easy-to-use. If you run into trouble, detailed web help and video tutorials are only a click or two away, with the offer of \u201cfree unlimited 24/7 telephone and email support\u201d that should help make any newbie comfortable.\nSage also has a more basic offering called Accounting Start. This doesn't include support for quotes, estimates or vendor bills, and has no cash flow forecasts and could be enough for start-ups as well as small businesses.\nRead our full Sage Accounting review.\nBest small business software: Best antivirus\nReasons to buy\nAvast Business is an excellent business antivirus and online security platform, giving you various tools such as antivirus, firewall, email protection, anti-spam and the ability to sandbox applications for complete security. Avast Business also includes a number of tools for your servers, and ranks top of our best business antivirus as well as our best antivirus in 2021 guide.\nThe AV protection you get is generally rated as good by independent testing, with Avast's engine blocking 99.7 per cent of threats in AV-Comparative's Real-World Protection report.\nThe free version of Avast has long been considered one of the best for home users, but If value for money and simplicity are key factors, Avast Business could be a sensible choice.\nRead our full Avast Business Antivirus review.\nBest small business software: Best small business tools\nReasons to buy\nBitrix24 provides a vast suite of powerful business tools: collaboration, instant messaging, telephony, project management, document handling, scheduling, employee management, and more.\nIf you prefer to keep things simple then you can concentrate on the excellent CRM, which is a capable system all on its own. Contacts and communications are logged, leads assigned to sales managers, emails sent, calls recorded, quotes and invoices issued. Detailed reports keep you up-to-date and there's convenient access via the mobile app.\nBitrix24's unusually generous free account supports 12 users and includes 5GB storage, but if you need more, there are additional paid-for accounts which offer more and for more users.\nOverall, Bitrix24 is offers a powerful suite of tools that is especially going to be handy for small businesses and start-ups to help them develop and grow through improved productivity, all in one platform.\nRead our full Bitrix24 review.\nOther small business software to consider\nWe've barely touched the surface of all the different software options a small business might want to consider, not least as there are multiple areas of interest and a strong range of competitors who want to offer the best product for you. However, here are a few more that get honorable mentions, either because they're positioned so well in their respective industries, or they offer a wider ranger of features-and all of them geared toward small businesses:\nPaypal is a long-established merchant gateway provider for taking online payments, and has since moved into physical retail as well as pay and go mobile card readers. All of which means that if you need a payment provider, Paypal can cover you well, no matter what sort of business you have. There's no monthly fee for the basic plan, which will cover online ordering, which helps reduce upfront fees. And once you're well established with a good sales volume and turnover, if you'd prefer to cut down transaction fees then you can switch to a merchant account where for a monthly fee upfront you'll pay mostly interchange rates on each transaction.\nZoho provides so many different software and apps for small business the bigger question might not be what they do, but what they don't. Zoho provides such a comprehensive range of solutions that it's impossible to do the company justice here, suffice to say that they-currently-provide at least 45 apps covering everything from sales, help desk, finance, people, IT, office, project management, and collaboration. What's even better is that not only do these all integrate with each other, but also often integrate with other popular business software platforms. If you need to do something, Zoho probably have already released software to do it!\nAdobe Creative Cloud is probably another toolkit to consider here, not least because of Adobe's real strengths in creativity and design, as well as PDF management-something every business will have to address at some point. Adobe sell different apps in different groups, however, so it's important to ensure you're looking at the correct set. However, don't be surprised if you end up subscribing to multiple apps, not least the creativity bundle that includes Photoshop, and Adobe Acrobat for creating, editing, annotating, and signing PDF files.\nSalesforce is possibly the leading sales solution for businesses of many sizes. Whether you're looking to focus on online or offline marketing, telephone or email sales, then this is an all-in-one platform that aims to bring customer sales and relationships together. However, it's not just about logging numbers and ticketing as much as improving all-round efficiency. This means you can look to improve key metrics across all processes, not least your sales and CRM channels, ensuring both a good synchronicity and efficiency between them.\nGoing mobile? We've featured the best small business apps.\nBest small business software FAQs\nWhich type of small business software is best for you?\nWhen deciding which small business software to download and use, first consider what your actual needs are, as sometimes platforms that aim to do a lot of different things may not offer such an extensive range of tools as one that focuses on one particular area. Additionally, budget software options can sometimes provide all the tools you may need, but higher-end software can really cater for the specialist, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may need to save on the pain of changing to a different software platform later on.\nHow we tested the best small business software\nTo test for the best small business software we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, whether as a download or as an online service. We then tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each software platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best IT Automation software of 2025\nAutomate systems that handle repeatable and mundane technical issues\nWe list the best IT Automation software, to make it simple and easy to set up and manage a single platform to automate systems that handle repeatable and mundane technical issues.\nIT operations involve a lot of work and effort. It starts from mundane tasks like setting up computers and keeping their operating systems updated to complex ones like managing devices remotely and configuring the internal network according to custom specifications. The tasks can be too overwhelming for staff, which is why many companies now employ IT automation tools to make things easier.\nIT automation deals with systems that handle repeatable and mundane technical tasks. Automation platforms perform the simple work that humans would have otherwise spent much time doing over and over again.\nThere are a lot of IT automation systems out there, with each having different specialties. It can be challenging to pick the best ones, but that\u2019s why we\u2019re here. We tested different IT automation platforms to identify the best ones. We narrowed our list based on important factors including pricing, ease of use, customer support, features, etc. After reading this review, it should be easy to make a good choice.\nReader offer: Get a 14-day free trial on NinjaOne\nNinjaOne is a cloud-based IT management platform designed for IT professionals.

With capabilities such as secure remote access, real-time alerts, and mobile device management, NinjaOne streamlines IT operations.\nWe've also featured the Best IT asset management tools.\nThe best IT Automation software of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest IT Automation software for IT service management (ITSM)\n1. SysAid\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSysAid is a platform designed to automate IT service management tasks. It utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to help enterprises automate their IT tasks and free up time they can use elsewhere.\nFor instance, SysAid offers ticket automation; it can automatically prioritize your IT tickets and send them to the right personnel that'll take care of the problem. It prioritizes tickets according to your pre-programmed instructions and what the AI system learns from studying your usage.\nYou can also automate repetitive IT tasks, e.g., resetting printers, granting access to software, and transferring files. You can use this platform to automatically onboard new employees and get them familiar with your IT setup. You\u2019ll get a full audit trail of the automated actions that you can review for compliance and security purposes.\nSysAid doesn\u2019t have standard pricing. Your bill depends on the features you want and your custom IT infrastructure, so you\u2019ll have to contact the company\u2019s sales team for a quote. There\u2019s no free plan but there\u2019s a free trial period to test the features before making your final purchase decision.\nBest IT Automation software for endpoint management\n2. NinjaOne\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNinjaOne is popular remote monitoring and IT management platform. It\u2019s very good for automating endpoint management, which refers to managing and supervising devices connected to a network.\nThis platform lets you write automation scripts to handle a lot of behind-the-scenes IT tasks. For example, you can write scripts to automatically back up files at specific times for each connected computer or a script to automatically update antivirus software when required. If you\u2019re not good at programming, you can use the drag-and-drop interface to create automations.\nNinjaOne's scripting engine works in various programming languages, including Javascript, ShellScript, Powershell, etc., and you can automate almost anything on a macOS or Windows operating system. You can control what devices to deploy the automation on. For instance, you can run automation for individual devices or for entire organizations and dynamic groups.\nNinjaOne is more than just endpoint management software. It offers broad IT service management features for enterprises. The drawback is that there\u2019s a steep learning curve if you want to utilize most of the platform\u2019s features.\nBest IT Automation software for robotic process\n3. UiPath\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUiPath is the world\u2019s most popular robotic process automation (RPA) tool, enabling enterprises to automate many IT tasks and free up time and effort to put them to use elsewhere.\nUiPath offers broad automation features. You can build and deploy different types of robots. The platform even comes with ready-made robots designed for various use cases, e.g., healthcare, finance, manufacturing, etc. A good example is using robots to process invoices and vendor payments and generate accounting reports.\nA good thing about UiPath is that you don\u2019t need deep coding experience to create robots on the platform. It offers a drag-and-drop interface to create robots by simply moving modules from one place to another. Your coding expertise still helps to create advanced robots, but it\u2019s not necessary, unlike with many rival RPA platforms.\nUiPath offers excellent customer support. You can contact a human support representative whenever you want and you also have access to a large collection of user guides, manuals, and video tutorials concerning all aspects of the platform. The drawback is that UiPath is pretty expensive, starting at $420 monthly.\nBest IT Automation software for large businesses\n4. Atera\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAtera is a remote monitoring and management software. It enables IT teams to stay on top of their technical infrastructure and ensure that things are always in good shape.\nThis platform incorporates artificial intelligence to help IT personnel automate a lot of tasks. The AI system can analyze common ticket requests and craft intelligent responses (though not always accurate). This feature helps you cut down on your ticket response and management time. AI can answer simple inquiries while your IT staff focuses on the more complex ones. The AI system can even tag and prioritize tickets for the IT staff to handle.\nYou can generate automation scripts using Atera's AI system. The platform comes with over 1,000 ready-made scripts but you can generate additional ones. Atera gives you deep visibility into all devices connected to your network, and you can automate software updates and patches.\nThis tool is very user-friendly, with an intuitive interface that\u2019s easy to understand and navigate. It also has mobile apps, which makes it convenient to use on the go.\nBest IT Automation software for Azure users\n5. Microsoft System Center\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nCloud computing is a major part of IT operations nowadays. Many enterprises are migrating from on-premise IT infrastructure to the cloud, and Microsoft Azure is one of the main cloud computing providers they choose.\nMicrosoft's System Center makes it easy to control and manage your IT infrastructure. You can manage all your Azure infrastructure from one place and automate a lot of tasks. For example, you can automatically monitor and troubleshoot your servers at specific periods to detect any issues before they morph into something more serious. You can allocate virtual machines depending on demand instead of renting unnecessary server space with hopes of future demand.\nMicrosoft doesn\u2019t offer a free plan for System Center, which is a disadvantage. Pricing can also run up to thousands of dollars annually, which makes it suitable for large organizations with significant IT budgets.\nA good thing about System Center is that it also enables you to manage on-premise IT infrastructure (servers and PCs) and not just cloud-based ones only.\nBest IT automation tool FAQs\nHow to choose an IT automation platform\nCost\nCost is the first thing to consider when choosing any software. You need to choose something that you can afford in the long term. Pricing for automation tools usually depends on the number of tasks and how big your IT infrastructure is, so it should be easy to estimate how much you\u2019ll pay beforehand. Always read the fine print to see if there are any hidden costs and check if there\u2019s a free trial to test the features before making your final decision.\nEase of use\nYour automation platform should be easy to use and navigate. It should have an intuitive interface that a layman can understand. Complex interfaces can frustrate users and cause costly mistakes.\nCustomer support\nThings can go wrong at any time, and you\u2019ll need external help to solve your issues. Ensure you choose an IT automation platform with a solid reputation regarding customer service; check user reviews to confirm this. You should be able to contact a human support representative via email, telephone, or live chat when you need one. You should also have access to additional support resources such as user guides and video tutorials.\nEssential features of an IT automation tool\n1. Robotic Process Automation (RPA)\nRobotic process automation (RPA) entails building and deploying software robots to handle repetitive tasks. For example, you can build bots to scrape websites and extract contact information or create bots to process employee payroll based on the number of hours worked.\nYour IT automation platform should let you build RPA bots, preferably with a drag-and-drop interface.\n2. Incident management\nYou should be able to manage technical incidents with ease. Your tool should give automatic alerts whenever it detects an IT incident and contact the personnel assigned to that issue beforehand. This feature takes away a lot of stress during the inevitable IT incident.\n3. Endpoint management\nThe tool should enable IT staff to manage multiple devices connected to the enterprise network and automate many tasks. For example, you should be able to install software automatically on all connected devices. It could be a new software recommended by management or an update to an already installed software. You can also automatically check for viruses and security bugs and deploy fixes immediately.\nEndpoint management automation makes IT management much easier for everyone, especially in large organizations.\nHow we tested the best IT automation tools\nWe test by evaluating numerous factors. To start with, we look at the feature set, the range of tools available, and what size of businesses this would be ideal for. We consider how easy the setup is, the simplicity of the interface, and whether there's sufficient documentation and tutorials for users to utilize necessary options optimally.\nWe assess how well the service integrates with other relevant apps, and check the overall scalability of the service. We also analyze whether there are collaboration features for multiple users, and lastly, we judge the quality of the customer service and the different pricing plans available.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nWe've listed the best IT asset management software.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Delivering the AI citizen experience \u2013 the future of government\nHow governments are transforming public services with AI\nIn today\u2019s digital-first world, citizens naturally expect that public services should be as quick and easy to use as their smartphone apps.\nIn Britain, we are at a turning point in our approach to artificial intelligence, particularly in the public sector. Governments are increasingly recognising that upgrading the \u2018citizen experience\u2019 by investing in cutting-edge technology will be vital to delivering tomorrow\u2019s public services.\nEarlier this year, in the Government\u2019s new \u2018AI Opportunities Plan\u2019, the Prime Minister highlighted how AI tools can \u201ctransform\u201d public services and deliver seamless experiences similar to how we manage money or book flights online. Most recently, the Prime Minister\u2019s announcement to \u201creshape\u201d the state offers a huge opportunity to reinforce the UK\u2019s ambitions to be an AI leader across the public sector.\nGroup Vice President and GM, UK and Ireland, ServiceNow.\nAI adoption starts now\nAt ServiceNow, we are working with hundreds of public sector bodies and can see how AI is already helping to cut through challenges, such as the 13.5 million hours doctors lose annually to outdated IT. Virtual assistants and advanced triaging systems are now helping to cut through the \u20188am rush\u2019 to book a GP appointment. We are seeing similar impacts in other departments such as the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).\nFor public services, the impact of technology is not some futuristic fantasy: it is here, now, today. The key to implementing this successfully is partnerships between the public and private sector. The Government\u2019s plan calls for the public sector to become a \u201cgreat customer\u201d of AI services. And yet analysis by GDS suggests that almost half of Government IT spend is dedicated to \u2018keeping the lights on\u2019 maintaining legacy systems. In the private sector, businesses are implementing AI to drive productivity and enhance the customer experience. It is vital that the public sector does so too.\nDelivering for citizens\nThe first step for government is replacing patchwork legacy systems with an AI platform to speed innovation, scale business processes, and forge a solid foundation. Analysis by the Social Market Foundation suggests that at HMRC and the DWP alone, eight million hours of staff time could be saved every year by using technology to streamline routine tasks. Moving away from legacy systems, siloed departments and patchwork IT is also crucial to delivering citizen experience, making it easier to connect to government services.\nRather than waiting for working-hours call centers and having to work out who the \u2018right\u2019 department is to speak to, digital channels and generative AI are offering real-time answers to citizens. Not only that, but AI\u2019s capacity also to process large stores of data are making digital services more effective and accessible.\nAI in public service\nForward-thinking government organizations have already adopted generative AI to deliver better service for citizens, as well as increasing efficiency and offering instant access to data. Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on domain-specific data are already helping government organizations respond rapidly, either by empowering agents with the information they need which might previously have been inaccessible, or by offering citizens direct access to data.\nThe future of government\nFrom managing risk to delivering improved citizen experience, cutting-edge technology is the key to overcoming many of the hurdles seen in previous government attempts at digital transformation. Ripping out the siloed legacy systems, which are all too often seen in the public sector and replacing them with a single AI platform connecting all data across the organization, will not only drive efficiency, but also pave the way for more wholesale innovation.\nThe addition of AI, and of its latest evolution with Agentic AI, is a stepping stone towards a new era of innovative, automated services \u2013 with citizens able to access personalized experiences, where and when they want.\nWe've compiled a list of the best IT infrastructure management services.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

So instead of repackaging PR blurbs and feature checklists, I decided to actually try them.\nThis guide is the result of hundreds of hours spent signing up, testing features, running real workflows, and figuring out which AI tools actually help get work done, across every major use case I could think of.\nI went deep into each tool, from image generation to email automation, chatbot building to scheduling assistants. TechRadar's team and I have personally tested every tool in this guide. So, let\u2019s get right into it.\nBest AI website builder tools\nWhen it comes to AI website builder tools, Hostinger is a standout.

He's been following the AI space closely for over five years, ever since the early days of GPT-2, giving him a solid perspective on how these tools have evolved. Alongside writing, he helps with editorial work to keep content updated and useful. Outside of work, you'll find him playing basketball or heading off on solo trips.\nBest AI chatbots\n1. Chat GPT\n- What is it: A fast, multimodal AI assistant from OpenAI that can understand and respond using text, images, audio, and even video.\n- Ideal for: Anyone who needs a flexible AI to help with writing, research, coding, image generation, file analysis, or even live conversations.\nI\u2019ve used ChatGPT for everything from writing blog drafts to debugging code and summarizing PDFs, and honestly, it\u2019s only getting better. The newest version, GPT-4o, is seriously fast and can now handle not just text but also images, audio, and videos (with Sora). It\u2019s like having a researcher, writer, translator, and creative partner all in one tab.\nThe voice capabilities of ChatGPT are only getting better with each passing day. You can have real-time conversations with ChatGPT using natural speech, and it actually responds with tone, pauses, and emotion. If you\u2019ve used earlier versions, the leap in responsiveness and clarity is obvious.\n\u2705You want an AI that can handle many tasks in one place: ChatGPT is great for writing, research, brainstorming, and file analysis without needing separate apps.\n\u2705You value customization and memory: With saved instructions and session memory, it gets better the more you use it.\n\u2705You need fast, natural-sounding voice interactions: GPT-4o\u2019s voice mode feels surprisingly human, ideal for hands-free workflows or accessibility use.\n\u274cYou rely on live, verifiable sources: While ChatGPT is improving, its browsing still isn\u2019t as integrated or reliable as Google\u2019s.\n\u274cYou want seamless collaboration with real-time documents: It doesn\u2019t sync directly with tools like Docs, Sheets, or shared calendars.\n\u274cYou prefer a visually guided interface: Most interactions are still chat-based, and there\u2019s no dashboard or modular layout for managing outputs.\nStill, my favourite update this year from ChatGPT is how the o-series models (like o3 and o4-mini) are starting to behave like real agentic assistants. They can decide when to use tools like web search, file readers, or DALL\u00b7E image generation on their own.\nIf you use it regularly, you also get smart memory and deeper personalization. It remembers your preferences, writing style, and past interactions, which makes back-and-forth workflows much smoother over time.\nI keep using it for more clarity and understanding, and it\u2019s fabulous how it remembers my past inputs. Here, you can see how it tells me about my previous doctor visits and the related details.\nChatGPT\u2019s free plan now includes access to GPT-4o with basic limits, which is more than enough for casual use. The ChatGPT Plus plan is $20/month, and it offers higher usage caps and faster access to new features (like image generation and longer memory). Team and Enterprise plans unlock more tools for collaborative and business use.\nBest All-in-One AI Assistant for Everyday Use\nChatGPT has matured from a simple text generator into a full-featured multimodal assistant that handles everything from writing and brainstorming to coding, file analysis, and visuals. With its consistent rollout of features and intuitive UI, it remains one of the most accessible tools in the AI space. Try GPT-4o for free or upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $20/month to unlock more tools, memory, and better performance.\n2. Google Gemini\n- What is it: A multimodal AI chatbot by Google that works across text, images, code, and voice, with deep integration into Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more.\n- Ideal for: People who use Google Workspace daily and want an AI that can help plan, write, organize, and multitask across their personal ecosystem.\nGemini has quietly become one of the smartest AI assistants out there, especially after the release of Gemini 2.5 Pro. I\u2019ve used it to pull data from Sheets, draft emails from long threads, and even clean up messy trip itineraries in Docs. It feels like a real assistant that knows where everything is.\n\u2705You\u2019re already embedded in Google\u2019s ecosystem: Gemini works best with access to your Gmail, Calendar, Docs, and other apps.\n\u2705You want a multimodal AI for visual + voice tasks: Its power to analyze images, respond to voice, and interact with media is a major strength.\n\u2705You care about fact-checking and accuracy: Gemini\u2019s auto-verification with Search makes it better for tasks that require up-to-date, factual info.\n\u274cYou need a tool for freeform creativity: Gemini can feel stiff when writing fiction, dialogue, or creative copy.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not comfortable sharing personal data: The AI\u2019s personalization relies heavily on your Google activity and history.\n\u274cYou expect full control over the assistant\u2019s behavior: Unlike ChatGPT, you can\u2019t deeply customize tone, response style, or role behavior yet.\nGemini's native integration with Google products, like Gmail, Calendar, and Photos, is probably the biggest reason it\u2019s a popular tool among the masses. You can ask it to summarize documents, draft replies, create tasks, and analyze photos. It also verifies answers with Google Search, which greatly reduces hallucinations.\nThat said, Gemini isn\u2019t perfect. It\u2019s incredible for structured tasks, but when I used it for open-ended brainstorming, it felt a bit flat compared to ChatGPT. Creativity and tone control still lag. Also, the personalization can be hit or miss, like it remembers your activity, but sometimes leans too heavily on past searches.\nYou can try Gemini for free, but Gemini Advanced ($20/month) gives you access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, 1M token context windows, and all the deep integrations. If you already live inside Google Workspace, it\u2019s an easy upgrade.\nGoogle Gemini \u2013 Best AI Assistant for Google Workspace Users\nIf your digital life revolves around Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and Calendar, Gemini is the AI you want in your corner. Built with native integration across Google Workspace and powered by the Gemini 2.5 model, it\u2019s designed to reduce busywork and surface insights across your files and tools. From summarizing documents to organizing your day, Gemini blends into your existing routines without extra setup. Enroll for Gemini Advanced absolutely free for the first month.\n3. Grok AI\n- What is it: An AI chatbot by AI focused on advanced reasoning, real-time search, and productivity, built into X (formerly Twitter) and now available across platforms.\n- Ideal for: Power users and developers who want deep reasoning, real-time search, and a flexible coding or document creation workspace.\nI picked Grok AI over Claude and Perplexity because it\u2019s evolving fast and is more than just a chatbot now. While Claude has a clean tone and Perplexity excels at retrieval, Grok 3 felt more capable when thinking through complex prompts, especially in math, logic, and scientific tasks. That alone made it worth exploring deeper.\n\u2705You want an AI with advanced reasoning: Grok 3\u2019s \u201cThink\u201d and \u201cBig Brain\u201d modes outperform most chatbots for logic-heavy, scientific, or technical tasks.\n\u2705You\u2019re a developer or power user: Grok Studio is great for perfect for coding, testing, and writing in one AI-assisted workspace.\n\u2705You want real-time summaries from the web: Its DeeperSearch feature taps into live web and X (Twitter) content, making it ideal for staying current.\n\u274cYou prefer polished UX and structured output: Grok\u2019s interface and tone still feel rough compared to Gemini or ChatGPT.\n\u274cYou\u2019re not on X or don\u2019t want to be: Full access requires an X Premium+ subscription, which may be a dealbreaker for those avoiding the platform.\n\u274cYou want advanced multimodal features now: While Grok has vision and voice features, they\u2019re newer and not as refined or widely integrated yet.\nIt comes with a canvas where I can write and test code or work on documents with AI help in real time. It's perfect for tasks where you want the AI to assist without bouncing between tabs.\nIt also has a built-in Deep/Deeper Search tool that pulls live data from the web and X, which is pretty powerful when summarizing trending topics with context. But it does take some time. My query, \u201cWhy is gold value soaring?\u201d took almost three minutes to process.\nNot to forget, Grok\u2019s UX can sometimes feel clunky, especially compared to Gemini or ChatGPT. Its tone occasionally leans too casual or offbeat. And while vision and memory features are improving, they\u2019re not as refined just yet.\nGrok is free on X, but the SuperGrok subscription provides full access, including Grok 3, Studio, Vision, and multilingual voice support. If you're technical or already active on X, it\u2019s surprisingly powerful.\nGrok AI \u2013 Best Reasoning-Based AI Assistant for Power Users\nGrok is built for people who want more thinking and less fluff. Whether you\u2019re analyzing complex ideas, coding in real time, or digging into breaking topics, Grok 3\u2019s deep reasoning and live web search help you move faster. Its integration with X and tools like Grok Studio gives it an edge for developers and tech-savvy users. Try the free version today.\nBest AI image generators\n1. Google Imagen\n- What is it: A text-to-image generator by Google that produces highly detailed, fast-rendering images across a wide range of styles and languages.\n- Ideal for: Designers, marketers, and creative teams who want photorealistic or stylized visuals with precise control over prompts and edits.\nWhen it comes to image quality and prompt accuracy, Google Imagen 3 is one of the strongest models I\u2019ve tested. I picked it over tools like Midjourney or DALL\u00b7E for two things: control and speed. Imagen gets the little things right, be it the textures, color gradients, and most importantly, prompt comprehension.\n\u2705You want extremely high-quality visuals from detailed prompts: Imagen 3\u2019s precision and realism are top-tier.\n\u2705You work in multiple languages or need fast iteration: It's efficient, multilingual, and great for creative prototyping.\n\u2705You want flexible image editing: Its step-by-step editing system saves time and frustration during revision.\n\u274cYou need full creative freedom without restrictions: Access is gated, and public availability is still catching up.\n\u274cYou want stylized, experimental results: other tools like Midjourney or Runway often deliver more artistic unpredictability.\nI gave it a prompt to \"Create an image of a mouse teaching rocket science to a class full of humans,\" and the result was pretty accurate. But as I\u2019m someone who never feels satisfied with an AI\u2019s first response, I decided to make it more lifelike.\nThe prompt was \u201cmake it more realistic,\u201d and the result is below.\nThis is exactly where it truly stands out, i.e., refining the images even better. You can edit elements step by step, which speeds up creative workflows massively. It\u2019s also noticeably fast, around 40% quicker than its previous version and supports multi-language prompts, which are super useful when testing in non-English scenarios.\nThe realism is impressive, though it leans more toward clean, polished outputs than artistic styles. It\u2019s not for pixel-level control or style blending like Midjourney, but for fast, good-looking visuals within a familiar setup, it nails the job.\nGoogle Imagen \u2013 Best AI Image Generator for Fast, Accurate Results\nImagen 3 strikes a strong balance between speed and fidelity, making it a go-to for design teams and marketers who want great visuals without spending hours tweaking prompts. With improved language understanding, better text rendering, and faster generation, Imagen is ready for creative production at scale. You can test it through ImageFX for free, or access premium tools and API integration via Google Vertex AI.\n2. ChatGPT 4o Images\n- What is it: A multimodal AI model by OpenAI that can generate, understand, and refine images based on natural language prompts, built into the broader ChatGPT 4o experience.\n- Ideal for: Creators and marketers who want to generate high-quality, stylized images while staying inside a flexible AI assistant that also handles writing, code, audio, and more.\nYou probably don\u2019t think of ChatGPT as an image generator but you should now. With the rollout of GPT-4o, OpenAI quietly upgraded its DALL\u00b7E 3 integration, and it\u2019s surprisingly capable. I\u2019ve been using it when I want visuals that tie directly into the text I\u2019m working on, whether it\u2019s for a pitch deck, a social post, or just testing visual concepts while writing copy.\nThe big win here is context. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re working on a product idea. You can describe the branding, voice, and features, and then say, \u201cNow create a realistic product shot based on everything we\u2019ve discussed\u201d.\n\u2705You want an AI that can generate and refine images in context, especially alongside your writing or research.\n\u2705You value ease of iteration: Edits like \u201cmake it sunset\u201d or \u201cadd more trees\u201d are just a prompt away.\n\u2705You\u2019re already using ChatGPT for content and want light design tools built in.\n\u274cYou want cinematic or surreal results: Other tools like Midjourney still outperform it in artistic complexity.\n\u274cYou don\u2019t plan to pay: image generation is locked behind the ChatGPT Plus paywall if you want a lot of images at once.\nAnd it actually does it, pulling context from the conversation so far. That kind of continuity is hard to beat.\nIt\u2019s also now easier to refine images using natural language. You can click \u201cEdit\u201d on a generated image and just describe the changes like \u201cmake it night-time\u201d or \u201cadd a streetlamp in the background.\u201d This makes iterative creation feel more like a conversation than a design tool.\nThat said, output quality still leans clean and literal. It\u2019s not as visually wild as Runway. Also, you can\u2019t adjust parameters like aspect ratio or style weight yet, which limits granular control.\nYou can use image generation features in ChatGPT for free. However, you can only generate 2-3 images. To get more, subscribe to ChatGPT\u2019s Plus plan for $20/ month.\nChatGPT 4o (Images) \u2013 Best Image Generator for Content + Visuals in One Flow\nIf you already use ChatGPT to write, code, or brainstorm, image generation is now built right in, so no need to switch apps. ChatGPT 4o\u2019s image generation (powered by DALL\u00b7E 3) works best when paired with longer conversations, giving you context-aware visuals with just a few clicks. It\u2019s simple, fast, and surprisingly smart for marketing assets, social creatives, and mockups. Free users can try a few images, but for full access, upgrade to ChatGPT Plus for $20/month.\n3. Adobe Firelfy\n- What is it: Adobe\u2019s AI-powered image generator designed for commercial use, with deep integration across Photoshop, Illustrator, and other Creative Cloud tools.\n- Ideal for: Designers, agencies, and content teams who need AI-generated visuals that are safe for commercial use and easy to edit inside Adobe apps.\nAdobe Firefly isn\u2019t the flashiest image generator but it\u2019s hands-down the most practical for professional creatives. I use it when I need visuals that won\u2019t raise legal eyebrows or when I want a smoother pipeline into tools like Photoshop or Express. Everything you generate is trained on licensed and rights-cleared content, so it\u2019s built from the ground up with commercial usage in mind.\n\u2705 You want AI visuals that are safe for commercial use: No copyright gray areas.\n\u2705 You already use Photoshop or Illustrator and want AI to speed up mockups or edits.\n\u2705 You care about editable layers and tight integration with your design workflow.\n\u274c You\u2019re looking for highly stylized or abstract art: Firefly sticks to safe, polished outputs.\n\u274c You don\u2019t use Creative Cloud tools: Standalone use feels limited by comparison.\n\u274c You want unlimited generation for free: Credits run out fast on the free plan.\nThe real magic happens after generation. You can push Firefly outputs straight into Photoshop and tweak layers, masks, or elements without needing to start from scratch. If you\u2019ve ever tried editing a Midjourney image in Photoshop, you\u2019ll know how big of a time-saver this is.\nI especially like the Generative Fill tool. You can erase part of a photo and tell Firefly what to replace it with, something like \u201cadd clouds here\u201d or \u201creplace this background with an office,\u201d and it fits in perfectly. It\u2019s clean, quick, and feels native to the editing experience.\nWhere it lags a bit is imagination. Firefly tends to stay within safe, brand-friendly boundaries. Don\u2019t expect surreal lighting or stylized chaos here as it\u2019s built for clean outputs, not experimental art.\nFirefly is available for free with limited credits, but to unlock faster rendering and full resolution downloads, you\u2019ll need a Creative Cloud plan, which starts at $19.99/month for individuals.\nAdobe Firefly \u2013 Best AI Visual Tool for Designers & Agencies\nFirefly is Adobe\u2019s answer to AI-powered content creation, but what makes it stand out is its seamless integration with the entire Creative Cloud suite. Whether editing in Photoshop, generating concepts in Illustrator, or refining brand visuals, Firefly gives you AI-generated assets that are ready to use in your workflow and safe for commercial projects. It\u2019s built for speed, collaboration, and compliance. You can try Firefly as part of the Creative Cloud All Apps plan, perfect for teams and creators working at scale.\nBest AI website builders\n1. Wix\n- What is it: Wix is one of the best website builders that uses AI to generate complete site layouts, content blocks, and branding elements.\n- Ideal for: Solo creators, freelancers, and small businesses who want a professional-looking site without hiring a developer.\nWix is one of the most established website builders out there, and its AI integrations make the setup process even faster. You just describe the kind of site you want, like business, portfolio, online store, and Wix creates a draft with layout, copy, images, and even a logo if you need it.\nWhile testing, its AI builder took only a few prompts and quickly generated a full website draft, complete with layout, text sections, colors, and a basic logo. The results really came down to how well I described the site\u2019s purpose and style. That means if your prompts are clear, the AI builder delivers something surprisingly useful.\n\u2705 You want a working site in minutes: Wix AI delivers full-page layouts and content within a few prompts.\n\u2705 You prefer editing with visuals, not code: The drag-and-drop interface gives you full design flexibility.\n\u2705 You want built-in tools beyond design: From payments to SEO to client bookings, Wix includes essential features for your online store and more.\n\u274cYou want total creative control from the start: The AI template might feel too structured for pixel-perfect custom design.\n\u274cYou need backend access or custom apps: Wix isn\u2019t built for advanced logic or server-side development.\nImportantly, the first draft came together pretty quickly, with relevant text sections and smart layout decisions I could immediately tweak. I then used the AI Text Generator to rewrite my homepage bio and dragged in a new image section, which the AI resized automatically. But if you don\u2019t like any of it, you can simply start over with a fresh layout instantly.\nNow, even though the initial layout setup took a moment, editing everything after that was simple. I renamed pages, swapped in new images, and adjusted sections without needing any design software.\nOutside the editor, Wix covers most of what you\u2019d need to run a website, like payments, bookings, email marketing, SEO tools, and even basics like logo creation and color presets. I like how it\u2019s all built in, so you\u2019re not constantly jumping between different apps just to get set up.\nBest AI Website Builder for Creative Control Without Code\nWix combines fast site generation with one of the most flexible editors out there. You can start with a few prompts, adjust layouts, rewrite content, and even rework your branding. Wix also comes with built-in tools for payments, SEO, bookings, and email campaigns, enough to run a small business without adding anything extra. The free plan is available with AI tools and templates. Premium plans start at \u00a317/month with a custom domain and eCommerce options.\n2. Hostinger\n- What is it: Hostinger is an all-in-one website hosting and building platform. It offers AI-generated sites, performance hosting, and beginner-friendly design features.\n- Ideal for: Beginners and solo creators who want a fast, affordable, and clean website without coding.\nHostinger\u2019s AI website builder takes a refreshingly minimal approach. You describe your idea in a few lines, like what the site is about, your preferred tone, color preferences, and the AI instantly turns that into a fully structured website. Layouts come prefilled with relevant text, images, and pages, often ready in under a minute. It\u2019s built for speed but leaves room for control, especially when you need to refine the details of the site.\nOnce the demo site was ready, I used its drag-and-drop editor to tweak the layout. Moving sections, changing colors, swapping images, and adjusting fonts felt easy to manage. There were 14 core elements to work with, including contact forms, image galleries, adding social icons, and a library of prebuilt sections for things like policies or service blocks. In my opinion, it wasn\u2019t overly flexible, but it offered enough control to get the site looking close to what I had in mind without much extra effort.\n\u2705 You want a website instantly from a sentence: Hostinger generates usable layouts and content in under a minute.\n\u2705 You\u2019re new to web design: No-code editor, auto backups, and mobile editing make the platform beginner-friendly.\n\u2705 You want extra AI tools bundled in: From SEO and blog writing to logos and product pages, Hostinger includes an entire toolkit.\n\u274c You need a very niche or complex layout: The first AI version may feel too basic unless your prompt is specific.\n\u274c You want long-term pricing consistency: Renewal costs rise significantly after the initial term.\nHonestly, Hostinger has a versatile ecosystem of AI tools. You get an AI writer, blog generator, SEO assistant, logo maker, and even a heatmap tool that predicts what people will click on.\nFor online stores, it helps generate product descriptions and email campaigns. The toolkit even includes a page generator that builds new layouts from a single sentence.\nHere, some pages may feel a bit generic if your input is vague, and you\u2019ll still need to do some editing, but overall, Hostinger strikes a smart balance between automation and manual control. It\u2019s fast, friendly, and a great pick for anyone starting from zero.\nBest AI Website Builder for Speed and Simplicity\nHostinger lets you launch a polished site in under a minute. Its AI builder creates a ready-to-edit layout from just one sentence, while extras like an AI writer, SEO assistant, and image generator help you fill out your content. It\u2019s fast, beginner-friendly, and comes bundled with hosting, email, and eCommerce tools. Grab a 75% discount on Hostinger\u2019s Premium Website Builder plan on a four-year term at just $2.99/mo.\n3. GoDaddy\n- What is it: GoDaddy is a business-first website platform that combines AI site building, e-commerce, and branded marketing tools.\n- Ideal for: Entrepreneurs and small business owners who want built-in tools for branding and sales.\nGoDaddy is best known as a domain provider for years, but it now offers a full-blown website builder that helps small businesses go from buying a domain to launching a complete site instantly.\nIts AI-powered website builder is equally good and a great starting point for a non-technical person. Under this, you just answer a few questions about your business and what you're trying to do. It then builds a complete website tailored to your category, whether it's photography, wellness, real estate, or something else.\nAnd since the layout comes with ready-made sections and prefilled text, you don\u2019t have to build webpages manually. It works well for local businesses or solo projects that need something clean and functional without getting stuck in design details.\n\u2705 You want a business site that markets itself: From captions to logos and emails, GoDaddy\u2019s AI helps drive engagement.\n\u2705 You\u2019re starting from scratch: Templates, themes, and automatic layout blocks guide you step by step.\n\u274c You want advanced design freedom: Customization is there, but more limited compared to open-ended builders.\nThe editor strikes a balance between AI support and hands-on control. You can experiment with new themes, switch colors, tweak fonts, and reposition layout blocks. There\u2019s also an AI logo maker and \u201cCreate with AI\u201d section that lets you generate everything from logos to social posts and captions. Even if you need a \u201cbook now\u201d button or gallery, simply describe what you need, and GoDaddy adds it automatically.\nGoDaddy puts just as much focus on marketing as it does on site design. You can generate social captions with AI, track email performance, and drop in eCommerce features like PayPal buttons without much setup. Even the free plan lets you accept payments. Plus, the social tools feel built-in rather than bolted on, with things like Google Photos access and quick caption prompts that actually make posting easier.\nWhile the single-page limit on the free plan might feel restrictive, it\u2019s a great starting point. GoDaddy also provides 24/7 support with an AI help assistant, which makes it super easy to get answers on the fly.\nBest AI Website Builder for Small Business and E-commerce Launches\nGoDaddy\u2019s AI Website Builder is both easy to use and powerful enough.

You can get started with the Basic Website Building plan at just $9.99/ month (41% discount) if you opt for the yearly package.\nBest AI virtual assistants\n1. Apple Siri\n- What is it: Siri is Apple\u2019s built-in voice assistant, now powered by Apple Intelligence, which delivers smarter, more contextual help across iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Apple Watches.\n- Ideal for: Apple users who want voice-driven assistance for everyday tasks, smart control, and system-wide context.\nEver since Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone, Apple has set the standard for tech innovation. So it\u2019s no surprise that the launch of Apple Intelligence is turning heads.\nWhether it\u2019s powering the latest iPhones, Macs, or even the ever-familiar voice assistant Siri, Apple is aiming to make everyday tasks feel effortless with intelligence that\u2019s context-aware, private, and seamlessly baked into your devices.\nClearly, Siri has moved well beyond timers and quick texts now. With the arrival of Apple Intelligence, you can now think of Siri as a real assistant. For example, if you change your mind mid-way while giving a command like \u201cSet an alarm. Wait, make that a 15-minute timer,\u201d Siri will understand it instantly.\nLast week, I asked it to send a file, and even without naming the app or saying the full contact name, it figured out exactly what I meant.\n\u2705 You work within the Apple ecosystem: Siri works across your iPhone, iPad, Mac, HomePod, and Apple Watch without extra setup.\n\u2705 You want privacy-first assistance: Most requests are processed on-device without leaving your hardware.\n\u2705 You need native voice control for daily tasks: From messages to timers to smart home scenes, Siri handles it all.\n\u274c You use mostly non-Apple products: Siri\u2019s strengths are deeply tied to Apple hardware and software.\n\u274c You rely on web-based productivity: It doesn\u2019t match Google Assistant or ChatGPT for open-ended queries yet.\nMoreover, Siri saw what was on the screen, understood the context, and handled the task without needing more input. This intuitiveness stays constant whether you\u2019re sending a message, playing music, or finding directions; it just works.\nSiri can connect to ChatGPT (with permission) to summarize documents, write creative pieces, or analyze photos, all without swiping screens or changing apps. You can ask it to explain system settings, draft an email, or pull up information from other apps, and it handles the request smoothly.\nBut I still see a lot of room for improvement here. Like, to test the most advanced features, having newer iPhones with iOS 18 or later is mandatory.\nAnd while Siri works beautifully within Apple\u2019s ecosystem, it\u2019s less effective for tasks that require external web tools or extensive automation.\nThat being said, with Apple devices, Siri now feels like a built-in sidekick. It picks up on your habits and quietly gets better, all without giving up your privacy.\nBest AI Virtual Assistant for Apple Users\nWith the rollout of Apple Intelligence, Siri has become significantly smarter. It can now understand on-screen context, follow up on previous commands, and even tap into ChatGPT when it needs extra help. Whether you\u2019re scheduling a meeting, sending a quick message, or just asking how to screen record, Siri blends seamlessly into your routine. It\u2019s available for free on all supported Apple devices running iOS 18 and above.\n2. Google Assistant\n- What is it: Google\u2019s longtime voice-powered assistant for Android and smart devices, now transitioning to Gemini for more advanced, AI-driven help.\n- Ideal for: Android users who want voice-based assistance for everyday tasks, real-time answers, and device-wide control.\nGoogle Assistant works across phones, tablets, smart speakers, and even in-car systems, so it\u2019s always within reach when you need it.\nWhether you\u2019re in the kitchen, driving, or just relaxing on the couch, you can use it to get things done without picking up your device.\nDuring testing, I asked it to check the weather, play music on a speaker, and add smoothie ingredients to my list. Commands like \u201cCall Dad\u201d and \u201cRemind me to drink water\u201d responded instantly.\nI even started a workout with Nike Run Club using just my voice. Notably, the Voice Match feature recognized who was speaking and kept responses personal on shared devices.\n\u2705 You rely on Google apps daily: Assistant connects natively with Gmail, Calendar, Maps, and Android settings.\n\u2705 You want effortless, real-time responses: Commands for reminders, timers, media, or location info are fast and hands-free.\n\u274c You don\u2019t want to relearn your assistant later: With Gemini taking over, sticking with Assistant now might just delay the switch.\nNow, Google is beginning to move away from Assistant and introduce Gemini, its next-generation virtual assistant powered by generative AI. This is a much smarter, more conversational experience that understands context better and works more seamlessly with apps. The transition is already underway on many new Android phones and will continue throughout the year.\nGemini builds on what Assistant already did well but adds a few new tricks. It can generate images, summarize documents, translate in real time, and offer more fluid conversations across devices.\nYou can still use Google Assistant on many devices, and it continues to handle everyday tasks and Google app integrations reliably.\nBut Gemini is where Google is heading. It brings more intelligence, flexibility, and awareness to your phone, home, and even your car.\nBest AI Virtual Assistant for Everyday Google Tasks\nGoogle Assistant still helps you manage your day with hands-free commands across Android phones, smart speakers, and other connected devices. It works directly with Gmail, Maps, Calendar, and smart home tools, making it easy to check reminders, get directions, or control your lights with just your voice. It continues to run reliably on millions of devices worldwide and remains free to use on Android phones and Google smart devices through 2025.\n3. Amazon Alexa\n- What is it: Amazon\u2019s voice assistant built into Echo devices and now evolving into Alexa Plus, a more conversational AI powered by generative technology.\n- Ideal for: Smart home users and Amazon shoppers who want hands-free control, productivity features, and built-in entertainment across devices.\nAlexa has grown from being a voice-controlled speaker into a full-fledged home assistant, and with the arrival of Alexa+, powered by generative AI, Alexa remembers more, responds with more personality, and handles tasks independently across apps and services.\nOn my Echo device, Alexa handles my reminders, helps me control smart lights with voice prompts, plays music, and even gives delivery updates without a hitch. With Alexa+, it feels more like talking to someone than giving commands.\nNow, it can pick up on incomplete questions, remember preferences like dietary needs, and even follow through on multi-step tasks, like finding a plumber and booking a visit.\n\u2705 You use Alexa for your smart home devices: Alexa+ improves everything from device control to alerts and media playback.\n\u2705 You\u2019re already a Prime member: Alexa+ is free for Prime users and available across Echo devices and mobile apps.\n\u274c You need AI for work or productivity workflows: Alexa+ is still more home- and lifestyle-focused than business-oriented.\nSmart home control feels smoother now. I could move music or video across devices and get Ring alerts when a package arrived, all without picking up my phone.\nYou can upload photos, event flyers, or even study material, and Alexa+ can summarize them or turn them into To-Dos or flashcards. It remembers key dates, routines, and even personal notes like family recipes or gift ideas.\nAlexa Plus is rolling out in phases, starting with Echo Show users, and is included free with a Prime membership.\nIf you just want the Alexa+ subscription, it costs $19.99/ month right now. It\u2019s built for what Amazon calls ambient intelligence, something that\u2019s always available, constantly learning, and ready to help whether you\u2019re on a speaker, phone, or browser.\nWhile the full rollout is still underway, Alexa Plus already feels like a smarter, more capable version of the original.\nBest AI virtual assistant for smart homes and everyday tasks\nA smarter upgrade to Amazon\u2019s voice assistant, Alexa+, uses generative AI to handle complex requests. It remembers your preferences and acts across apps and devices without additional prompts. It\u2019s built into Echo speakers and displays, with proactive alerts, personalized routines, and smart home control that works even across rooms. It comes included for free with Amazon Prime, or is available for $19.99/month excl. Early access rolling out to Echo Show users in the U.S.\nBest AI voice generators\n1. Murf.ai\nMurfai.ai is by far one of the most popular AI voice generators. Their AI-powered voice technology can create realistic voices that sound like real humans, with intonation, pronunciation, and emotions that are similar to those of a human speaker.\nUsers can generate voices in a wide range of languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Chinese, and more. They also offer different accents for each language, allowing users to select the one that suits their projects.\nCustomization features include adjusting the voice speed, pitch, and volume to suit your specific needs, and the option to choose between male and female voices, which can add more versatility to your projects.\nLike most of its alternatives, Murf.ai offers a pay-per-use model, which means that you only pay for the number of characters you need to convert to speech. You also get a free trial with 5,000 characters, to get you started with the software and allow you to test the service before committing to a plan. Murf.ai starts at $29/month or $19/ month if billed yearly.\n2. Play.ht\nPlay.ht is a text-to-speech (TTS) service that allows users to convert written text into realistic-sounding audio. The software offers a range of options for users, including male voices, female voices, and multiple languages.\nOne of the main advantages of Play.ht is its ease of use. All you need to do is simply copy and paste your written text into the platform, select the voice and the language you want, and the tool will generate your desired audio for you. You also get a variety of customization options, such as the ability to adjust the speed and pitch of the voice.\nAnother benefit of Play.ht is its range of pricing plans to suit different needs and budgets, hosting a variety of premium plans and payment options. They offer pay-as-you-go options as well as monthly subscriptions. Additionally, Play.ht offers a free plan with a 5,000-word limit. Premium plans start at $39.25/ month or $29.25/ month billed yearly\nHowever, note that the service may not be suitable for users who require highly specialized voices. If you need strong regional accents or unique speech patterns this might not be your suitable option.\nWhile the voices are generally of high quality, they may sound robotic and unnatural sometimes, especially when speaking longer pieces of text.\nPlay.ht is useful, efficient, and cost-effective for users who need to convert text to audio fast and easily, but it may not be the best choice for all users.

It\u2019s important to note that Google Translate's strength lies in its extensive language support, as it provides translations for over 100 languages. On top of that, the translator also seamlessly integrates with Google products like Chrome and Google Docs. This makes it convenient for you to access translations while working on different projects and sites.\nAgain, even for informal purposes, Google Translate is a big show. It is super helpful for talking to people from different countries, sharing funny memes, or figuring out what foreign songs or movies are all about. It's like a language bridge for both casual and formal conversations.\nSimilarly, if you want to make your conversations easier, the voice-to-text function in the software lets you speak and have it translated. It not only provides translations but also perceives the sound. Additionally, Google Translate displays the part of speech when translating a single word and suggests other possible variations.\nAlthough Google Translate is very useful, it does have a few limitations we must throw light on. Sometimes, it has trouble with idiomatic expressions, which can make the translations sound strange. Meanwhile, at times, the accuracy of complex sentences can also be inconsistent. This is more of a concern since translations are confusing at times. Furthermore, there are worries regarding the privacy policies of Google Translate due to the fact that the translated material is stored and utilized for training purposes.\n2.

This feature is commonly used for remote interpretation services and lets the interpreters provide live translations. Plus, for educational purposes, Microsoft Translator offers inclusivity through live captioning and cross-language understanding which brings a more engaging learning environment for students and parents alike. It also handles domain-specific terms through custom models, which improve its utility in specialized fields.\nOverall it features a user-friendly interface, like text-to-speech and speech translation features. With all this, you can translate text instantly or in batches, and it even supports a wide range of formats, from simple text to complex documents. Plus, its integration with other Microsoft products, such as Outlook and Word further improves its accessibility and convenience for everyday use.\n4.

It stands out because of its advanced neural network technology through which it delivers translations that are not just precise but also capture the subtle details of the original text.\nWe love that DeepL pays close attention to the small details that make languages unique. This makes it the top pick for experts and regular people who want accurate translations. DeepL can understand phrases that have special meanings or certain linguistic values, which helps the translations sound natural and real in the language they're being translated into.\nOne of the standout features of DeepL is its ability to translate entire documents while retaining their original formatting. Users can upload PDF, Word (.docx), and PowerPoint (.pptx) files which makes it particularly useful for business and academic settings where maintaining the integrity of the document's layout is crucial.\nDeepL also offers a glossary and dictionary feature, which allows users to add specific terminology to ensure translations are accurate and consistent with industry jargon. On top of that, DeepL deals with 32 languages, including a variety of European and some Asian languages.\nFor those looking to refine their writing, DeepL offers the DeepL Write Beta, which helps fix grammar and punctuation mistakes, rephrase sentences, and adjust the tone of the text. This feature is great for professionals who need to produce polished, high-quality written content.\nWhen it comes to performance, DeepL is often compared to other major translation services like Google Translate, Systran, Microsoft Translator, and Amazon Translate. While Google Translate supports more languages, DeepL is frequently praised for its higher accuracy, particularly for European languages.\nBest AI music generators\n1.

      "text": "Everyone wants to reach artificial general intelligence but why?\nKamales Lardi dives into the world of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)\nDuring an Executive Briefing session for the board members of a luxury brand last year, one question kept popping up \u2013 when will we reach singularity? I designed Executive Briefing sessions to inspire and educate senior executives and board members on the latest disruptive trends and how exponential technologies create opportunities for business and revenue generation.\nSo, it was not a surprise when these questions arose, as it was the hype of the moment and congesting the media coverage of artificial intelligence (AI). However, this is not the right question to ask, particularly considering companies, and the board members taking part in the session, may not even be around when humanity has to reckon with artificial general intelligence (AGI) \u2013 systems with human-like cognitive capabilities to generalize knowledge, learn new things, and adapt to various situations.\nAuthor of Artificial Intelligence for Business.\nWhat is intelligence, really?\nBefore delving into the possibilities of AGI, it would be prudent to first explore the meaning of intelligence in the human context. In my new book, Artificial Intelligence For Business, I delve into the depths of intelligence and its definition, a topic of debate even among experts . Whether we approach it from a psychological or physiological perspective, the understanding and definition of human intelligence remains challenging because of one fundamental variable \u2013 the human subject.\nIntelligence goes beyond information processing, reasoning and problem-solving. It is the ability to reason, learn from experience, adapt to new situations, and make sense of abstract concepts. More importantly, human intelligence is also guided by our biases, experiences, cultural backgrounds, beliefs, creativity, emotional awareness, and our ability to navigate social dynamics.\nThese are not just mental capabilities, but are embodied and relational. Our decisions are impacted by goals, value, ethics and intuition formed through lived experiences, making intelligence a complex element that is difficult to define and replicate.\nReplicating human intelligence\nIn its current form, artificial intelligence in the most advanced systems, such as large language models or computer vision tools, are common examples of Narrow AI. These are AI systems created to carry out tasks with a high degree of efficiency and operates within predefined rules. It lacks the understanding and adaptability that humans possess. Narrow AI are trained on vast datasets to recognize patterns and generate predictions, but in my view, these systems do not \u2018\u2019understand\u2019\u2019 the way humans do.\nIntelligent systems do not form context, nor do they possess common sense or emotional insight. It operates based on statistical probabilities and optimizes outputs within boundaries set by the data it is trained on. It simulates intelligence, quickly enough to trick us into believing it is intelligent, but these systems do not experience intelligence. Even the most powerful systems that exist today are simply tools - albeit impressive tools - but are not fully aware of the outputs, goals and implications they create.\nSo, what is Artificial General Intelligence?\nAlso referred to as Strong AI, AGI represents the pinnacle of artificial intelligence research. AGI can understand and learn intellectual tasks much like a human being and enables machines to apply knowledge and skills across different contexts. This means solving unfamiliar problems without any prior training, transferring knowledge between domains, reasoning in abstract terms, and continuously adapting.\nAGI would be able to write a novel, design a marketing campaign, solve an engineering problem, and give emotional advice, all with the nuance and adaptability of a human. It would be capable of reflection, strategy, and perhaps even self-directed learning. In theory, it could outperform humans at virtually any intellectual task. Although we may believe many of the existing systems today offer these capabilities, what we are experiencing is the incredible speed of processing vast data, uncovering patterns in the data, and producing commonly accepted outputs to respond to requests. True AGI would be able to perform any intellectual tasks that a human can, equipped with understanding and reasoning required to navigate a range of different challenges.\nThe value of AGI can be truly transformative for humanity, and it is no wonder technology leaders seem to be in constant pursuit of this next frontier. It holds a promise of exponential development across industries, and the potential return on investment so enormous, that every technology company wants to hold the key to AGI. But the uncertainty and risks that come with such systems can also be unimaginable.\nWhy race towards AGI?\nAt the center of AGI is a potent mix of fear, uncertainty, economic potential, ambition and ideology. The promise of AGI is not just another technological milestone, it could be considered a foundational shift that could unlock solutions to humanity\u2019s most urgent challenges and the potential rewards are staggering. AGI supporters view it as a potential force multiplier, able to accelerate scientific discovery, optimise resource distribution, and address climate risks.\nCommercial incentives are also compelling. The institution or organization controlling AGI would dominate not only other industries, but also redefine how value is created and destroy its competition in the global market. From a geopolitical dimension, AGI is viewed as a strategic asset and weapon of mass disruption that could set global standards, lead in defense innovation, and control critical infrastructure. Additionally, there is an ideological aspect to consider. Selected leaders in the global technology community genuinely believe AGI could elevate humanity for the better, while others are driven by personal gain and legacy.\nThe race towards AGI\nFrom a psychological and societal perspective, AGI forces us to confront the fundamental question of what it means to be human. Can we create machines or systems that can rival our own mind? Can we replicate, and potentially even surpass, the very thing that makes us human? And if machines can learn, create and think like us, what would our role be in this new ecosystem? How could we aspire to govern such systems to ensure human dignity, purpose and autonomy are fully retained? This is a formidable challenge, and in my view, unrealistic in the near future.\nFor senior leaders and board members contemplating these questions, my advice is to focus on the more pressing question of how current and rapidly-developing AI solutions are impacting industries and businesses. This, in itself, is a reality that is transforming the world as we know it.\nWe've featured the best AI chatbot for business.\nThis article was produced as part of TechRadarPro's Expert Insights channel where we feature the best and brightest minds in the technology industry today.

Bubble\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBubble is one of the oldest no-code platforms, and offers enough dexterity to allow you to turn complex ideas into innovative apps.\nThe platform allows for deeply customized workflows with complex conditional logic, which can handle sophisticated business processes. But to make the most of the platform you\u2019ll first have to master its learning curve.\nBubble is a versatile platform, and you can use it to create a wide variety of apps without writing any code. It can help build marketplaces, e-commerce stores, social media networks, software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms, and more.\nYou can use the platform\u2019s drag-and-drop editor to design sophisticated user interfaces, and define complex workflows visually, which makes it easier to manage and iterate on intricate features.\nThe platform has all the UI elements you\u2019ll usually throw in your apps. On top of that it also offers a wide range of tools for more functionality, from payment gateways to analytics, and more.\nOne of the best things about Bubble\u2019s design editor is that it offers granular control over every visual element. You can use it to control the appearance and style the elements by adjusting their colors, fonts, spacing, shadows, and more. The platform will also let you tweak how elements behave, and resize depending on the user's screen to ensure the apps look good across all screen sizes.\nBubble also has a visual workflow builder that allows you to control how data moves through your app, handle user interactions, and trigger automated actions based on specific events.\nThe platform has also rolled in AI features throughout the build process.

Lovable\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSure, visual drag-and-drop interfaces ease app development, but throwing in AI into the mix makes it a whole lot easier. In fact, thanks to natural language processing, you can use Lovable to essentially \"talk\" your app into existence.\nAll you have to do is describe your app idea in plain English, and Lovable takes care of the rest. It\u2019ll design, and code the app, and even let you preview it in real time. There\u2019s literally no learning curve involved getting to grips with Lovable\u2019s straightforward chat-based app creation experience.\nFor instance, you can ask it to \u201cbuild a marketplace where users can buy and sell sustainable products, with a modern looking UI.\u201d The platform will process your description, and start assembling the core structure of the app, including all necessary backend functionality, along with the UI.\nRemember though, Lovable\u2019s success depends on how well you describe your app\u2019s requirements. This is why it\u2019s best to spend some time refining your prompts, ensuring you pass clear and detailed instructions for the AI to deliver better results.\nThe best thing about Lovable is its verbosity, and live previews. The platform will tell you how it plans to design, and develop your app. After it\u2019s done writing the code, it\u2019ll display a preview of the app. Best of all it\u2019ll keep updating the preview as you continue refining the app, adding features, and functionality.\nLovable relies on Supabase, the open source Firebase alternative, to add comprehensive backend services. You can type your way to integrate Supabase into your app, before asking the platform to add features like a database, user authentication, payments, subscriptions, and more.\nAnother good thing about Lovable's AI is its debugging abilities. The platform actively monitors the backend as you work on your app, and will flag any issues. The AI will offer to fix most of the issues, and you can always ask it for suggestions to help solve the ones it can\u2019t on its own. If adding some functionality requires something that needs to be done at your end, Lovable will also guide you through its setup.\nIf you do know how to code, Lovable gives you the option to grab the code for your web app. Unlike some platforms that lock you into their ecosystem, you can use Lovable to sync the code with your GitHub repo. Any changes you make to the code on GitHub will automatically sync to Lovable. If you don\u2019t want to go via GitHub, you can even edit the code on Lovable itself.\nLovable\u2019s free plan limits the AI queries to five times/day for a total of 30 messages/month. This is good enough to get a taste of the platform, before you switch to one of the paid plans that offer more features, and higher usage limits.\nRead our full Lovable review.\nBest no-code platform for creating apps with complex logic\n4. Thunkable\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you want greater flexibility when building apps, take a look at Thunkable. The platform has a learning curve, but that\u2019s because it offers more dexterity for building apps than its peers.\nOne of the USPs of the platform is its visual, block-based programming system, inspired by MIT\u2019s App Inventor and Scratch. You can use it to write complex logic in your apps by building conditional statements, controlling program flow, and executing actions based on specific conditions, all without writing any code.\nThunkable has several kinds of blocks, each of which represents a programming construct. For instance, there are Logic blocks that help define conditional statements, and execute specific actions based on predefined conditions, and events, like button clicks and screen changes.\nThen there are Control blocks that are often used together with logic blocks, and allow you to make decisions in your apps. Think of these as writing \"if this, do this\" and \"if this, do this, else do that\" statements to execute different actions based on conditions, but through a visual interface.\nAll the blocks in Thunkable are color-coded. You put them together as if you\u2019re assembling a puzzle. And you can\u2019t go wrong since the pieces only fit together if they make sense logically, which makes the platform even more accessible to non-programmers.\nThunkable also gives access to native mobile hardware, and OS features like the camera, accelerometer, push notifications, bluetooth, and more. You can access these functionalities through App Features blocks.\nBest of all, you can use the platform to build native mobile apps for both Android and iOS from a single project, and publish them directly to the respective app stores.\nOf course, in addition to its unique block-based programming system, Thunkable also offers all the features you\u2019d expect from a leading no-code platform.\nIt has a diverse collection of essential user interface components like buttons, sliders, as well as media components, sensors, and more. You can easily drag-and-drop them into your apps, and then customize each element's properties, such as color, size, and layout, to match your app's branding.\nThe platform also integrates with a wide range of popular services and tools, such as Google Maps, Stripe, Firebase, Airtable, Google Sheets, Xano, RevenueCat (for in-app purchases, and subscriptions), and more.\nIn addition to its web-based app preview, you can also use the Thunkable Live mobile app to test your app on real devices. The platform offers a tiered pricing structure, including a free tier with limited features that\u2019s good enough to explore the platform, before you commit to one of the paid plans that offer more advanced capabilities.\nRead our full Thunkable review.\nBest no-code platform for creating multilingual apps\n5. Hostinger Horizons\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you want to \u201cconverse\u201d your app into existence, just like Lovable, but English isn\u2019t your first language, you can use Hostinger Horizons, which supports over 80 languages.\nThe platform's AI can understand and respond in any of the supported languages. This means you can describe your app idea in your native language, and the AI will still generate a functioning web app for you.\nNot only does the platform\u2019s AI understand multiple languages, but the content of the app itself, such as its UI elements, labels, text, and more, can also be generated in different languages.\nFor instance, you can tell the AI to \u201ccreate an appointment booking web app for a yoga studio, where users should be able to view available class times, and book a session. The app should support English and Spanish.\u201d\nThe AI will first list the implementation steps, and then generate the entire app structure complete with a homepage with class info, booking form, confirmation page, and such. It\u2019ll also add a language switcher to help you switch between the two languages. If it doesn\u2019t, you can always prompt the AI to do so, or perhaps make it appear as a toggle, or a dropdown menu.\nBest of all, you can switch languages mid-process, and even localize your app for multiple regions.\nFor example, you can start building the app in English, then start conversing with the AI in French, and even ask it to generate a German version of the app as well. You can also ask it to create region-specific landing pages with localized offers, and ensure the booking form offers region-specific pricing, and promotions.\nThe app will add a region navigation bar for easy switching between regions, displays prices in the correct currency, and maintains selected language across region changes. This makes Horizons a wonderful option for non-technical users from different linguistic backgrounds.\nThe platform will also helpfully suggest ideas to help extend the app, like connecting a database, implementing checkout functionality, and such. Most of these functionalities are possible because of Horizons\u2019 integration with Supabase.\nOnce you\u2019ve built your app, you can launch it and take advantage of Hostinger\u2019s infrastructure, which offers web hosting, domain services, professional email, and other tools.\nHorizons is currently available to all existing users with a Hostinger hosting subscription, who can use it for free, but can only prompt the AI five times per day. To use it professionally though you\u2019ll have to subscribe to one of Horizons\u2019 paid plans.\nRead our full Hostinger Horizons review.\nBest no-code platform for creating apps with existing business data\n6. Glide\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGlide is a no-code app builder that excels at creating web apps from your existing data. If you\u2019ve got business data sitting in spreadsheets, and databases, you can make it visible, and interactive, with user-friendly, dynamic apps without much effort.\nGlide can connect to various data sources, from spreadsheets like Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, Airtable, and data warehouses like BigQuery, to relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and cloud databases like Google Cloud SQL.\nVery helpfully, you can use the platform to not just connect to various data sources, but also pool in data from multiple data sources into a single Glide app. So you can, for example, combine legacy data from a PostgreSQL database with customer information stored in Google Sheets.\nInterestingly, the platform will keep the data in sync. So any changes in your spreadsheets, or databases are reflected in the app, as well as the other way round.\nThis makes Glide a good option to create all kinds of internal business tools, like inventory management, CRMs, sales trackers, dashboards, order collection forms, and such.\nOh, and if you\u2019re using Glide to build a data-driven business app from scratch, you can get a jumpstart using one of its templates for common business apps such as CRMs, customer portals, inventory management systems, sales dashboard, and more.\nYou can also use the platform\u2019s own Glide Tables to store the data, or Glide Big Tables if you need an enterprise-scale database.\nAfter you\u2019ve pointed it to your existing data source, Glide will look through it, and create a basic app structure based on the data, with a handful of screens, each with one or multiple components. For instance, it\u2019ll turn tables into tabs, rows will become collection items, and such.\nYou can then customize the app's layout, and add more components like buttons, and forms using Glide's intuitive drag-and-drop interface.\nAnother useful feature is Glide\u2019s role-based access control that allows you to manage who can see and interact with specific parts of your app's data. Depending on your data source, you can either assign roles, like Admin, Editor, or Viewer to users, or define Row Owners, which then control access to different sections of the app and its underlying data.\nSo if you\u2019re building a CRM, you can ask Glide to ensure Sales Reps can only see/edit their own leads, while Managers can see everyone\u2019s.\nAnother advantage with Glide is that you don\u2019t have to rely on external automation tools. You can instead use Glide Workflows to automate tasks, though the platform still lets you use external workflow builders like Zapier and Make.\nRead our full Glide review.\nBest no-code platforms FAQs\nWhat can you build with the best no-code apps?\nIn recent times, no-code tools have emerged as the goto option for quickly creating functional prototypes and minimum viable products (MVPs). They aid developers and businesses rapidly validate ideas, accelerate prototyping, and help bring apps to market a lot faster than with traditional coding.\nThey are also popularly used to create data dashboards, and knowledge management systems that can store, organize, and retrieve information.\nUse of AI by no-code platforms\nAn increasing number of no-code platforms are incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities into the app development process. In essence, the use of AI enables users to create full-stack apps by simply describing them in plain English.\nOnce described, the platforms leverage AI to generate both the front-end, and the back-end for the app. In addition to generating the initial code, some no-code platforms also use AI to flesh out the apps by adding features, and even help troubleshoot and resolve errors.\nChoosing the right no-code platform for you\nTo choose the right no-code platform, begin by defining your apps\u2019 needs, before you evaluate a platform\u2019s features by taking them for a spin with free trials.\nWhen looking at a platform, ensure it integrates with the business tools you already use, and choose a platform that can grow with your business, and handle increasing data and user demands.\nDepending on your use case, you might also want to consider security features like data encryption, user authentication, and access control. It\u2019s always a good idea to lean towards platforms that offer good documentation, and active user communities.\nHow we tested the best no-code platforms\nWe tested the best no-code platforms by evaluating numerous factors. To start with, we looked at the feature set, the range of tools available, and what size of businesses this would be ideal for. We considered how easy the setup was, the simplicity of the interface, and whether there's sufficient documentation and tutorials for users to utilize necessary options optimally.\nWe also assessed how well the no-code service integrates with other relevant apps, and checked the overall scalability of the service. We also analyzed whether there were collaboration features for multiple users, and lastly, we judged the quality of the customer service and the different pricing plans available.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Why AI should worry every business\n4 key aspects of AI that businesses should worry about\nAs a business founder in the tech space I am spending increasing amounts of time thinking about AI and its impact. Is Artificial Intelligence (AI) as the beginning of the end of humanity? Or is it our savior?\nThe truth almost certainly lies somewhere in the middle, but that said, I believe there are very clear reasons why businesses really should be worried about AI.\nFounder of Container Solutions.\nAmara\u2019s Law\nAmara\u2019s Law states that the impact of technologies is overestimated in the short term but underestimated in the long term. Driverless cars, which have been coming out next year every year since 2016, is an example of overestimation.\nArtificial neural networks, the key technology behind almost all AI systems you\u2019ve heard of, might be good at playing Breakout and even predicting how proteins fold, but it cannot (yet) cope with the chaos of roads that, in my home village of Greenwich, were laid down by feet and hooves hundreds of years ago.\nAmara\u2019s Law works because researchers and practitioners, some driven by greed, others by fortune and others still by curiosity, but all of them nonetheless driven, find ways to improve the technology, find uses for it and eventually batter it into shape.\nFor business this is a worry for two reasons. On the one hand, if managers overestimate the readiness of a technology, then they tend to allocate too many resources to implementing it immediately at scale. Such quick ramp-ups are always followed by embarrassing climb downs.\nOn the other hand, if a technology is underestimated, like many did with the cloud and are doing right now with Artificial Intelligence, then all of a sudden they will find themselves playing catch up to their competitors.\nA general-purpose technology\u2019s destiny lies in users\u2019 hands\nThe second reason to worry is that general purpose systems, like the content of Pandora\u2019s box, cannot be put back once let out. For example, in the hands of Tim Berners-Lee, the personal computer and the Internet became the web. In the hands of a failed physicist in a garage in Seattle, the web gave birth to Amazon.com. What will artificial neural networks become in the hands of a hacker?\nThe box has been opened and we cannot put back the knowledge, the discoveries or the opportunities, good and bad, that opening the box created.\nThe end of the world of work as we know it\nThe third reason is the dramatic and continued effects on the labor market. Way before 2025 raised its head, McKinsey and the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPCC) were worrying about job losses and what the latter called the upcoming \u2018job apocalypse\u2019.\nAs I see it the job apocalypse seems to be coming to pass. Announcements are made daily about governments opening up their data to private firms to train their artificial neural networks and of companies shedding their workforces and replacing them with AI \u2018agents\u2019. We all know talented people who have never previously been out of a job but now can\u2019t find one.\nBusinesses have a triple challenge: rearranging their teams to work alongside AI agents, reassuring those left in the workforce, even though realistically there is nothing reassuring about what is happening, and doing so whilst the Damoclean Sword of Artificial Intelligence is suspended not by a horse\u2019s hair but by something much less tenuous: the whims of a man in an office looking at a spreadsheet.\nReaping what we all sowed\nThe fourth reason is probably the worst of all.\nIn the early part of the 2010s, Cambridge Analytica illegally collected the personal data of millions of Facebook users. From that data, psychographics, a portmanteau of psychology and demographics, were used to place targeted political advertisements into the social media streams of millions of people.\nThese political messages nudged enough people to vote for Donald Trump in the US presidential election of 2016. For their role in the Cambridge Analytica scandals, Facebook was fined $5 billion by the Federal Trade commission. By the time that happened, Donald Trump had already won the election.\nSince 2016, sustained upheaval in the labor market continues to cause a remarkable amount of misery. In the UK, the latest reports state that 5.2 million children live in poverty. That\u2019s 1 in every 3 children. In the United States, in 2023, the child poverty rate increased to 13.7 per cent.\nClass tensions have always preceded the rise of populist, strong-men leaders. In 2016, when good old fashion propaganda collided with good old fashioned data theft, web technologies graduated from tools of commerce to\u2026 the ultimate tool of propaganda on planet Earth.\nArtificial Intelligence, including the creation of deep fakes, is coming of age at the exact same moment when content moderation teams are being dismantled and strong man politics is on the rise. This new, unfettered age of disinformation has collided with people that are so desperately poor and devoid of hope that they will vote for anyone who promises to take down the elites who made them suffer so much. Politicians of all stripes sowed the wind. We all now have to reap the whirlwind.\nBusiness leaders might not think they have the luxury of thinking about politics, yet if they work in technology they are simultaneously part of the problem and potentially the solution. Ignorance is no defense!\nConclusion\nArtificial Intelligence is a tidal wave that is currently breaking, and breaking things, all around us. Because it\u2019s already here, commentary on AI is a peculiar, often confusing and an almost always out of date, mixture of description and prediction.\nThere\u2019s some consensus on the past but not much consensus on the future. AI is likely to become cheaper and easier to wield and exactly where it takes us will depend on the politics and ethics (or lack thereof) of the user.\nAnd Amara\u2019s Law tells us that AI is about to get really practical any moment.
