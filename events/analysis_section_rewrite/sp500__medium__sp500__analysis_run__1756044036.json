      "feedback": "Strong scaffolding and horizon fit, but the piece would reach world-class quality with a tighter, testable scenario map, explicit triggers/invalidations, sharper fundamentals framing, and tighter use of numbers and sources. Actionable edits: (1) Build a 3–4: Base case, Up/Down/Alternative scenarios for the 3–6 month horizon with timing windows (e.g., 0–4 weeks monitor IPO cadence; 4–8 weeks test small-cap re-rating signals; 8–12 weeks adjust equity tilt; 12–24 weeks finalize base/alts) and clear invalidations (e.g., IPO activity collapses or AI leadership persists and risk-on rosters fail to materialize) with citations after each claim (Q7VVGNSQE; 4661GWFP7; 2YP1X9B4T). (2) Quantify regime signals and thresholds: quote valuation gaps (Russell 2000 cheapest vs S&P 500 since 2008), share of negative-earning small caps, IPO proceeds and counts (95 IPOs, ~$12.9B in 2025 YTD vs 73 deals, ~$16B in 2024) and embed these as explicit triggers/conditions (Q7VVGNSQE); (4661GWFP7). (3) Tie macro/flows concretely to a path: specify how improving macro risk appetite and a revived IPO/flow environment would drive small-cap re-rating, while a deterioration would invalidate the base case (Q7VVGNSQE). (4) Strengthen first-principles grounding: frame the rotation as re-pricing of durable cash flows under lower discount/bond-market risk, linking to value/quality tilt via IUSV (large-cap low-vol) and XLV (healthcare quality) as defensive anchors, with exact exposure/color from the ETF factor reports (4661GWFP7; 2YP1X9B4T). (5) Integrate the Disney micro with the broader narrative by drawing a causal line from rigid, time-based perks to flexible monetization of demand and scalable cash flows, and cite U3ZK13ZQI. (6) Sharpen watch-list signals with concrete metrics: IPO cadence, Russell 2000 balance-sheet quality metrics, valuation gaps vs S&P, leadership in healthcare/quality/low-vol themes, and fund-flow momentum, each tied to citations (Q7VVGNSQE; 2YP1X9B4T; 4661GWFP7; 2YP1X9B4T; XLV’s profile via 2YP1X9B4T). (7) Reconcile conflicts and avoid over-reliance on a single source by clearly attributing each assertion to its source IDs and presenting a unified stance (cite U3ZK13ZQI for Disney; 4661GWFP7 and XLV/2YP1X9B4T for ETF rationale; Q7VVGNSQE for small-cap/IPO narrative; YX2J8NHZ1 for dividend-stock alts). (8) Tighten the narrative with precise numbers or ranges where possible (e.g., IPO counts/flows, valuation gaps, yield levels) rather than generic statements, and ensure every quantitative claim has a corresponding source tag. This will elevate depth, causal coherence, and decision usefulness while preserving the intended base-case/alts/watch-list structure.",
