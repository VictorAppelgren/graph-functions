  "content": "Sam Altman is preparing to co-found a new company funded by OpenAI that will go up against Elon Musk's Neuralink, The Financial Post reported. The startup, called Merge Labs, will use AI for its brain-computer interface and compete directly with Neuralink, along with other nascent companies in the field like Precision Neuroscience and Synchron.\n\nThe name Merge Labs comes from a term Altman used in 2017 called \"the merge\" that describes the moment human brains and computers come together. The company will raise funds, most from OpenAI's ventures team, that will set its valuation at $850 million. Altman will co-found Merge Labs with Alex Blania (from World, an eyeball scanning company also backed by OpenAI) but won't invest any capital himself, according to three people with direct knowledge of the project.\n\nAltman has been interested in the topic of machine-brain interfaces for years and suggested in the 2017 article above that the merge could arrive as soon as 2025 (it didn't). More recently, he wrote in another blog post a \"high-bandwidth brain-computer interface\" could soon be developed with the aid of recent tech advances.\n\nAltman's Merge Labs will be a direct competitor to Musk's Neuralink, intensifying the rivalry between the two that kicked off when Musk left OpenAI's board in 2018. Mind link technology has existed for decades now, but recent advances in implant tech and AI have allowed researchers to collect and process higher signal levels from the brain.\n\nNeuralink started its first human trials in January 2024 with quadriplegic subject Noland Arbaugh and later implanted its tech into a second anonymous subject. That subject, \"Alex,\" has reportedly been able to play FPS games and create 3D designs, while suffering from fewer issues and side effects as Arbaugh.",

The procedure was apparently successful, with Musk saying the individual \u201cis recovering well\u201d one day after the surgery.\nNeuralink, which aims to create brain-computer interfaces (BCI), began recruiting human patients for its first clinical trial last fall after getting the green light from the FDA. At the time, Neuralink said that people \u201cwho have quadriplegia due to cervical spinal cord injury or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)\u201d may qualify for the study. \u201cThe initial goal of our BCI is to grant people the ability to control a computer cursor or keyboard using their thoughts alone,\u201d the company wrote in a statement.\nMusk didn\u2019t share any other details about the procedure or the status of the trial. He said that \u201cinitial results show promising neuron spike detection.\u201d Successfully implanting its device into a human patient would be a major milestone for the company, which Musk has claimed could one day enable people to experience alternate realities. The company is also facing a federal investigation for allegedly violating animal welfare laws."

      "text": "Neuralink says it may have fixed its brain implant problem\nThe first patient's implant experienced issues, wherein its threads retracted from his brain.\nNeuralink has published an update on the second patient in its early human trials, and it said that \"promisingly,\" it has \"observed no thread retraction\" in the participant. The Elon Musk-led startup implants a chip into the human brain, allowing paralyzed patients to control devices, browse the internet and play video games with their thoughts. It implanted a chip into its first patient back in January, and while the procedure went well, some of the implants' connective threads retracted from the brain weeks later. That reduced the brain signals the device could receive.\nFor its second patient called Alex, the company employed mitigation measures to prevent the same thing from happening, or at least lower its probability. It said it reduced brain motion during surgery and also reduced the gap between the implant and the surface of the brain. The company hasn't observed any thread retraction in the patient, so far. As for its first patient, it modified an algorithm to improve how his implant detects and translates signals after the was observed. It said the first patient's threads have stabilized and his implant has since recovered.\nWeeks after his surgery in July, Alex has already been able to use computer-aided design (CAD) software to design a custom mount for his Neuralink charger. The mount was 3D printed, and he has since added it to his setup. He has also been able to use his implant in conjunction with a mouth-operated joystick to play Counter-Strike 2 more effectively, because he can now move and aim at the same time.\nNeuralink say it's now working on making its chip capable of decoding multiple clicks and movements to \"deliver full mouse and video game controller functionality.\" It's also developing algorithms that can recognize a user's intent to write by hand, which would enable faster text entry. That would then allow people who cannot speak, such as those with ALS, to be able to communicate with others more easily. Finally, the company apparently plans to give its implants the capability to interact with the real world, so that people can use it to move their own wheelchair or a robotic hand to feed or clean themselves."

      "text": "We are past the event horizon; the takeoff has started. Humanity is close to building digital superintelligence, and at least so far it\u2019s much less weird than it seems like it should be.\nRobots are not yet walking the streets, nor are most of us talking to AI all day. People still die of disease, we still can\u2019t easily go to space, and there is a lot about the universe we don\u2019t understand.\nAnd yet, we have recently built systems that are smarter than people in many ways, and are able to significantly amplify the output of people using them. The least-likely part of the work is behind us; the scientific insights that got us to systems like GPT-4 and o3 were hard-won, but will take us very far.\nAI will contribute to the world in many ways, but the gains to quality of life from AI driving faster scientific progress and increased productivity will be enormous; the future can be vastly better than the present. Scientific progress is the biggest driver of overall progress; it\u2019s hugely exciting to think about how much more we could have.\nIn some big sense, ChatGPT is already more powerful than any human who has ever lived. Hundreds of millions of people rely on it every day and for increasingly important tasks; a small new capability can create a hugely positive impact; a small misalignment multiplied by hundreds of millions of people can cause a great deal of negative impact.\n2025 has seen the arrival of agents that can do real cognitive work; writing computer code will never be the same. 2026 will likely see the arrival of systems that can figure out novel insights. 2027 may see the arrival of robots that can do tasks in the real world.\nA lot more people will be able to create software, and art. But the world wants a lot more of both, and experts will probably still be much better than novices, as long as they embrace the new tools. Generally speaking, the ability for one person to get much more done in 2030 than they could in 2020 will be a striking change, and one many people will figure out how to benefit from.\nIn the most important ways, the 2030s may not be wildly different. People will still love their families, express their creativity, play games, and swim in lakes.\nBut in still-very-important-ways, the 2030s are likely going to be wildly different from any time that has come before. We do not know how far beyond human-level intelligence we can go, but we are about to find out.\nIn the 2030s, intelligence and energy\u2014ideas, and the ability to make ideas happen\u2014are going to become wildly abundant. These two have been the fundamental limiters on human progress for a long time; with abundant intelligence and energy (and good governance), we can theoretically have anything else.\nAlready we live with incredible digital intelligence, and after some initial shock, most of us are pretty used to it. Very quickly we go from being amazed that AI can generate a beautifully-written paragraph to wondering when it can generate a beautifully-written novel; or from being amazed that it can make live-saving medical diagnoses to wondering when it can develop the cures; or from being amazed it can create a small computer program to wondering when it can create an entire new company. This is how the singularity goes: wonders become routine, and then table stakes.\nWe already hear from scientists that they are two or three times more productive than they were before AI. Advanced AI is interesting for many reasons, but perhaps nothing is quite as significant as the fact that we can use it to do faster AI research. We may be able to discover new computing substrates, better algorithms, and who knows what else. If we can do a decade\u2019s worth of research in a year, or a month, then the rate of progress will obviously be quite different.\nFrom here on, the tools we have already built will help us find further scientific insights and aid us in creating better AI systems. Of course this isn\u2019t the same thing as an AI system completely autonomously updating its own code, but nevertheless this is a larval version of recursive self-improvement.\nThere are other self-reinforcing loops at play. The economic value creation has started a flywheel of compounding infrastructure buildout to run these increasingly-powerful AI systems. And robots that can build other robots (and in some sense, datacenters that can build other datacenters) aren\u2019t that far off.\nIf we have to make the first million humanoid robots the old-fashioned way, but then they can operate the entire supply chain\u2014digging and refining minerals, driving trucks, running factories, etc.\u2014to build more robots, which can build more chip fabrication facilities, data centers, etc, then the rate of progress will obviously be quite different.\nAs datacenter production gets automated, the cost of intelligence should eventually converge to near the cost of electricity. (People are often curious about how much energy a ChatGPT query uses; the average query uses about 0.34 watt-hours, about what an oven would use in a little over one second, or a high-efficiency lightbulb would use in a couple of minutes. It also uses about 0.000085 gallons of water; roughly one fifteenth of a teaspoon.)\nThe rate of technological progress will keep accelerating, and it will continue to be the case that people are capable of adapting to almost anything. There will be very hard parts like whole classes of jobs going away, but on the other hand the world will be getting so much richer so quickly that we\u2019ll be able to seriously entertain new policy ideas we never could before. We probably won\u2019t adopt a new social contract all at once, but when we look back in a few decades, the gradual changes will have amounted to something big.\nIf history is any guide, we will figure out new things to do and new things to want, and assimilate new tools quickly (job change after the industrial revolution is a good recent example). Expectations will go up, but capabilities will go up equally quickly, and we\u2019ll all get better stuff. We will build ever-more-wonderful things for each other. People have a long-term important and curious advantage over AI: we are hard-wired to care about other people and what they think and do, and we don\u2019t care very much about machines.\nA subsistence farmer from a thousand years ago would look at what many of us do and say we have fake jobs, and think that we are just playing games to entertain ourselves since we have plenty of food and unimaginable luxuries. I hope we will look at the jobs a thousand years in the future and think they are very fake jobs, and I have no doubt they will feel incredibly important and satisfying to the people doing them.\nThe rate of new wonders being achieved will be immense. It\u2019s hard to even imagine today what we will have discovered by 2035; maybe we will go from solving high-energy physics one year to beginning space colonization the next year; or from a major materials science breakthrough one year to true high-bandwidth brain-computer interfaces the next year. Many people will choose to live their lives in much the same way, but at least some people will probably decide to \u201cplug in\u201d.\nLooking forward, this sounds hard to wrap our heads around. But probably living through it will feel impressive but manageable. From a relativistic perspective, the singularity happens bit by bit, and the merge happens slowly. We are climbing the long arc of exponential technological progress; it always looks vertical looking forward and flat going backwards, but it\u2019s one smooth curve. (Think back to 2020, and what it would have sounded like to have something close to AGI by 2025, versus what the last 5 years have actually been like.)\nThere are serious challenges to confront along with the huge upsides. We do need to solve the safety issues, technically and societally, but then it\u2019s critically important to widely distribute access to superintelligence given the economic implications. The best path forward might be something like:\nSolve the alignment problem, meaning that we can robustly guarantee that we get AI systems to learn and act towards what we collectively really want over the long-term (social media feeds are an example of misaligned AI; the algorithms that power those are incredible at getting you to keep scrolling and clearly understand your short-term preferences, but they do so by exploiting something in your brain that overrides your long-term preference).\nThen focus on making superintelligence cheap, widely available, and not too concentrated with any person, company, or country. Society is resilient, creative, and adapts quickly. If we can harness the collective will and wisdom of people, then although we\u2019ll make plenty of mistakes and some things will go really wrong, we will learn and adapt quickly and be able to use this technology to get maximum upside and minimal downside. Giving users a lot of freedom, within broad bounds society has to decide on, seems very important. The sooner the world can start a conversation about what these broad bounds are and how we define collective alignment, the better.\nWe (the whole industry, not just OpenAI) are building a brain for the world. It will be extremely personalized and easy for everyone to use; we will be limited by good ideas. For a long time, technical people in the startup industry have made fun of \u201cthe idea guys\u201d; people who had an idea and were looking for a team to build it. It now looks to me like they are about to have their day in the sun.\nOpenAI is a lot of things now, but before anything else, we are a superintelligence research company. We have a lot of work in front of us, but most of the path in front of us is now lit, and the dark areas are receding fast. We feel extraordinarily grateful to get to do what we do.\nIntelligence too cheap to meter is well within grasp. This may sound crazy to say, but if we told you back in 2020 we were going to be where we are today, it probably sounded more crazy than our current predictions about 2030.\nMay we scale smoothly, exponentially and uneventfully through superintelligence."

      "text": "A popular topic in Silicon Valley is talking about what year humans and machines will merge (or, if not, what year humans will get surpassed by rapidly improving AI or a genetically enhanced species). Most guesses seem to be between 2025 and 2075.\nPeople used to call this the singularity; now it feels uncomfortable and real enough that many seem to avoid naming it at all.\nPerhaps another reason people stopped using the word \u201csingularity\u201d is that it implies a single moment in time, and it now looks like the merge is going to be a gradual process. And gradual processes are hard to notice.\nI believe the merge has already started, and we are a few years in. Our phones control us and tell us what to do when; social media feeds determine how we feel; search engines decide what we think.\nThe algorithms that make all this happen are no longer understood by any one person. They optimize for what their creators tell them to optimize for, but in ways that no human could figure out \u2014 they are what today seems like sophisticated AI, and tomorrow will seem like child\u2019s play. And they\u2019re extremely effective \u2014 at least speaking for myself, I have a very hard time resisting what the algorithms want me to do. Until I made a real effort to combat it, I found myself getting extremely addicted to the internet. [1]\nWe are already in the phase of co-evolution \u2014 the AIs affect, effect, and infect us, and then we improve the AI. We build more computing power and run the AI on it, and it figures out how to build even better chips.\nThis probably cannot be stopped. As we have learned, scientific advancement eventually happens if the laws of physics do not prevent it.\nMore important than that, unless we destroy ourselves first, superhuman AI is going to happen, genetic enhancement is going to happen, and brain-machine interfaces are going to happen. It is a failure of human imagination and human arrogance to assume that we will never build things smarter than ourselves.\nOur self-worth is so based on our intelligence that we believe it must be singular and not slightly higher than all the other animals on a continuum. Perhaps the AI will feel the same way and note that differences between us and bonobos are barely worth discussing.\nThe merge can take a lot of forms: We could plug electrodes into our brains, or we could all just become really close friends with a chatbot. But I think a merge is probably our best-case scenario. If two different species both want the same thing and only one can have it\u2014in this case, to be the dominant species on the planet and beyond\u2014they are going to have conflict. We should all want one team where all members care about the well-being of everyone else.\nAlthough the merge has already begun, it\u2019s going to get a lot weirder. We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants. My guess is that we can either be the biological bootloader for digital intelligence and then fade into an evolutionary tree branch, or we can figure out what a successful merge looks like.\nIt\u2019s probably going to happen sooner than most people think. Hardware is improving at an exponential rate\u2014the most surprising thing I\u2019ve learned working on OpenAI is just how correlated increasing computing power and AI breakthroughs are\u2014and the number of smart people working on AI is increasing exponentially as well. Double exponential functions get away from you fast.\nIt would be good for the entire world to start taking this a lot more seriously now. Worldwide coordination doesn\u2019t happen quickly, and we need it for this.\n[1] I believe attention hacking is going to be the sugar epidemic of this generation. I can feel the changes in my own life \u2014 I can still wistfully remember when I had an attention span. My friends\u2019 young children don\u2019t even know that\u2019s something they should miss. I am angry and unhappy more often, but I channel it into productive change less often, instead chasing the dual dopamine hits of likes and outrage.\n(Cross-posted from https://medium.com/wordsthatmatter/merge-now-430c6d89d1fe to here for consistency; thanks to Medium for inviting me to write this!)"
