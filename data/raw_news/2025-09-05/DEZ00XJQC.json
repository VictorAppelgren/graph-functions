  "title": "Capital Allocation Trends At Flowtech Fluidpower (LON:FLO) Aren't Ideal",
  "description": "If you're looking at a mature business that's past the growth phase, what are some of the underlying trends that pop...",
  "content": "If you're looking at a mature business that's past the growth phase, what are some of the underlying trends that pop up? A business that's potentially in decline often shows two trends, a return on capital employed (ROCE) that's declining, and a base of capital employed that's also declining. This combination can tell you that not only is the company investing less, it's earning less on what it does invest. So after glancing at the trends within Flowtech Fluidpower (LON:FLO), we weren't too hopeful.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Flowtech Fluidpower is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.0052 = UK\u00a3330k \u00f7 (UK\u00a386m - UK\u00a323m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2024).\n\nTherefore, Flowtech Fluidpower has an ROCE of 0.5%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Trade Distributors industry average of 12%.\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Flowtech Fluidpower compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free analyst report for Flowtech Fluidpower .\n\nWhat The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us\n\nWe are a bit anxious about the trends of ROCE at Flowtech Fluidpower. The company used to generate 8.2% on its capital five years ago but it has since fallen noticeably. In addition to that, Flowtech Fluidpower is now employing 37% less capital than it was five years ago. The combination of lower ROCE and less capital employed can indicate that a business is likely to be facing some competitive headwinds or seeing an erosion to its moat. If these underlying trends continue, we wouldn't be too optimistic going forward.\n\nOur Take On Flowtech Fluidpower's ROCE\n\nTo see Flowtech Fluidpower reducing the capital employed in the business in tandem with diminishing returns, is concerning. It should come as no surprise then that the stock has fallen 13% over the last five years, so it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Unless there is a shift to a more positive trajectory in these metrics, we would look elsewhere.",

The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling. Pipelines and storage facilities will be critical to moving larger volumes of oil and gas efficiently, especially with the renewed emphasis on LNG exports to meet global demand.\n22 companies\nChevron\nMarket Cap: US$320.7b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in the integrated energy and chemicals operations in the United States and internationally.\nCVX\nUS$157.69\n7D\n-1.0%\n1Y\n11.9%\nWilliams Companies\nMarket Cap: US$70.5b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in the United States.\nWMB\nUS$57.58\n7D\n-0.7%\n1Y\n28.4%\nKinder Morgan\nMarket Cap: US$59.4b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in North America.\nKMI\nUS$26.71\n7D\n-1.1%\n1Y\n24.3%\nMarathon Petroleum\nMarket Cap: US$54.4b\nOperates as an integrated downstream energy company in the United States.\nMPC\nUS$178.98\n7D\n-0.2%\n1Y\n6.2%\nCheniere Energy\nMarket Cap: US$52.6b\nAn energy infrastructure company, primarily engages in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) related businesses in the United States.\nLNG\nUS$236.97\n7D\n-2.1%\n1Y\n30.7%\nONEOK\nMarket Cap: US$46.5b\nOperates as a midstream service provider of gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation, storage, and marine export services in the United States.\nOKE\nUS$74.38\n7D\n-2.0%\n1Y\n-19.0%\nDT Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$10.6b\nProvides integrated natural gas services in the United States.\nDTM\nUS$105.30\n7D\n1.1%\n1Y\n37.1%\nHess Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.6b\nOwns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream assets and provide fee-based services to Hess and third-party customers in the United States.\nHESM\nUS$41.28\n7D\n-0.7%\n1Y\n14.4%\nAntero Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.5b\nOwns, operates, and develops midstream energy assets in the Appalachian Basin.\nAM\nUS$18.09\n7D\n1.4%\n1Y\n24.0%\nKinetik Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$6.7b\nThrough its subsidiaries, operates as a midstream company in the Texas Delaware Basin.\nKNTK\nUS$42.69\n7D\n-0.2%\n1Y\n-3.9%\nPBF Energy\nMarket Cap: US$3.2b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in refining and supplying petroleum products.\nPBF\nUS$28.25\n7D\n6.1%\n1Y\n-12.3%\nRattler Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$2.2b\nRattler Midstream LP owns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream and energy-related infrastructure assets in the Midland and Delaware Basins of the Permian Basin.\nRTLR\nUS$15.22\n7D\n3.5%\n1Y\n45.0%\nDelek US Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.9b\nEngages in the integrated downstream energy business in the United States.\nDK\nUS$31.92\n7D\n18.4%\n1Y\n61.7%\nPar Pacific Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.8b\nOperates as an energy company in the United States.\nPARR\nUS$34.16\n7D\n0.9%\n1Y\n67.1%\nClean Energy Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$548.2m\nOffers natural gas as alternative fuels for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions in the United States and Canada.\nCLNE\nUS$2.55\n7D\n-3.4%\n1Y\n-7.3%\nOPAL Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$390.1m\nEngages in the production and distribution of renewable natural gas (RNG) for use as a vehicle fuel for heavy and medium-duty trucking fleets throughout the United States.\nOPAL\nUS$2.22\n7D\n-4.7%\n1Y\n-36.8%\nSummit Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$272.1m\nFocuses on owning, developing, and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets primarily shale formations in the continental United States.\nSMC\nUS$23.25\n7D\n11.1%\n1Y\n-37.1%\nGranite Falls Energy\nMarket Cap: US$91.1m\nEngages in the production and sale of ethanol and its co-products in the continental United States.\nGFGY\nUS$2,975.00\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a\nStabilis Solutions\nMarket Cap: US$73.5m\nAn energy transition company, provides turnkey clean energy production, storage, transportation, and fueling solutions primarily using liquefied natural gas (LNG) to various end markets in North America.\nSLNG\nUS$3.75\n7D\n-7.1%\n1Y\n-6.9%\nVivakor\nMarket Cap: US$35.6m\nOperates, acquires, and develops technologies and assets in the oil and gas industry in the United States and Kuwait.\nVIVK\nUS$0.77\n7D\n3.0%\n1Y\n-58.0%\nMirage Energy\nMarket Cap: US$894.4k\nThrough its subsidiaries, focuses on developing an integrated pipeline and natural gas storage facility in Mexico and the United States.\nMRGE\nUS$0.0017\n7D\n6.3%\n1Y\n-75.7%\nEnergtek\nMarket Cap: US$51.4k\nProvides natural gas delivery solutions based on mobile pipe-less technologies and products.\nEGTK\nUS$0.0001\n7D\n0%\n1Y\n0%"

  "argos_summary": "Flowtech Fluidpower (LON:FLO) is experiencing a decline in capital efficiency, with its ROCE falling from 8.2% five years ago to 0.5% in 2024, and capital employed reduced by 37%. The company\u2019s earnings remain negative, and its stock has dropped 13% over five years, reflecting investor concern. Analysts project a turnaround in profitability within three years, but current fundamentals suggest continued underperformance relative to the UK trade distributors industry and the broader market.",
