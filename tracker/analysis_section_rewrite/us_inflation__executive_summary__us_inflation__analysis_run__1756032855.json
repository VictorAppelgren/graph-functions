      "feedback": "Actionable edit plan (compact, 4–6 lines): rewrite the piece as a tight base-case/alt-case/watchlist executive brief, with a crisp three-layer house view (foundation: first-principles cloud/AI moat; translation: ROIC, cash flow, network effects; pricing: discount-rate/valuation) and explicit catalysts, triggers, and invalidations tied to named data points (e.g., Shopify GMV 163B, Rev 5.0B, GM 16% FCF margin; Azure +39% YoY; Shopify US e‑commerce GMV ≈12%; cloud spend toward $2.4T; 12–18% justness premium; 1.8–2.2% yield band). Condense the long narrative into 4–6 bullets or sentences: Base Case (AI productivity uplift ~1–1.5% annual), Key Catalysts (Range cadence sustains 1–1.5% uplift; MSFT/Azure momentum; SFN unwind margin normalization), Key Risks (AI productivity disappointment; policy/financial-condition shocks; alt-asset liquidity), and Watch Signals with lead times (tariff-truce renewal; cloud spend momentum to $2.4T; oil-supply surprises; AI-productivity stability; cost-of-capital trajectory; policy-rate path). Strengthen attribution by placing each factual claim next to a source ID from the MATERIAL (e.g., QFDWCTAYB; 0G3A676BP; 4LQD15CFU; TN66GHPAT; FOM34PUWA; RHXDOHQQX; ILYC1M41F; J99EM2TPZ) and avoid mixed or extraneous material (the alt-asset chapters should be pared or tightly tied to liquidity/volatility inputs). Sharpen the causal chain to three explicit steps: (1) invariant drivers—cloud/AI moat and ROIC expansion; (2) market transmission—capital intensity, AI tooling monetization, and ecosystem solutions lifting cash generation and risk-adjusted returns; (3) pricing/valuation—durable FCF yields and a disciplined capital-allocation framework supporting a long-run earnings-power narrative. Tighten the scenario structure by defining precise triggers and clear invalidations (e.g., Range uplift <0.5% for two consecutive reads plus a 20% downside in Pacaso/Mogul/Gameflip liquidity as the downside delimiter), and replace generic statements with quantified ranges wherever possible. Finally, align strictly to the SECTION FOCUS by delivering a concise 4–6 sentence executive view that integrates the fundamental, medium, and current views, with a single, decision-useful house stance and a tight watchlist of six signals with explicit lead times.",
