  "content": "Cincinnati leaders are reportedly calling on members of the local government to bring charges against a White man seen slapping a Black man during a viral confrontation that left six injured and led to seven arrests in late-July.\n\nIn a public discussion hosted by Ohio State Rep. Cecil Thomas on Monday, community members met to discuss concerns over the city\u2019s handling of the investigation into the fight, WLWT reported.\n\n\"The video speaks for itself,\" Thomas said, according to the outlet. \"The method by which this situation has been handled raises serious questions as to whether there is bias involved in this investigation. It also brings into question the lack of integrity and whether there is something else to hide.\"\n\nAdditional footage of the assault obtained by WLWT shows the unidentified White man allegedly hitting a Black man in the face, leading to several others joining in on the beatdown that ultimately left six people injured.\n\nA separate video obtained by Fox News Digital depicts a White man repeatedly using a racial slur toward the group in the moments before the fight.\n\nThe update comes over two weeks after the incident broke out on the corner of Fourth and Elm streets in the early morning hours of July 26.\n\nCINCINNATI VIRAL BEATING BODYCAM RELEASED AS SUSPECTS FACE NEW CHARGES IN GRAND JURY INDICTMENT\n\nLast week, a grand jury indicted Patrick Rosemond, 38, Jermaine Matthews, 39, Montianez Merriweather, 34, DeKyra Vernon, 24, Dominique Kittle, 37, and Aisha Devaughn, 25, on three counts of alleged felonious assault, three charges of assault and two charges of aggravated rioting, the Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office confirmed to Fox News Digital.\n\nIf convicted, they each face the possibility of up to 29 years in prison.\n\nA seventh individual, 32-year-old Gregory Wright, was arrested Monday afternoon and is facing charges of alleged aggravated riot and aggravated robbery, according to the Hamilton County Jail.\n\nAll seven suspects are Black, sparking questions from local leaders about the investigation and why the White man has not been charged.\n\n\"Our community is restless, and they're watching,\" Pastor Leslie Jones said, according to WLWT. \"Since you don't think young people vote, old folks do. And they have told me they know how to vote, they know how to answer. If you don't prosecute this gentleman \u2013 and we're not talking about \u2013 we're demanding prosecution in the next 24 hours.\"\n\nAdditionally, Cincinnati mayor Aftab Pureval told WLWT that any decisions regarding additional charges will be \"made as soon as possible.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I agree with everyone\u2019s frustration,\" Pureval said, according to the outlet. \"I have been clear about my expectations that, in order to preserve both public safety and fairness, anyone involved in perpetrating the violence should be charged. Until all participants are held accountable, justice hasn\u2019t been fully served. And I\u2019m grateful that community leaders and residents are continuing to come together to make their expectations clear.\"\n\nThe mayor\u2019s office and Rep. Thomas did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s request for comment.",

In a video obtained by Fox News Digital, an unidentified man can be heard yelling racial slurs while being beaten in the street, with some claiming the male victim slapped the perpetrator prior to the fight breaking out.\nCINCINNATI RESIDENTS ON EDGE AFTER VIRAL BEATDOWN SPARKS CRIME CONCERNS: 'WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NEXT?'\nAnother angle shows a woman, later identified as \"Holly,\" attempting to break up the fight before she is also slammed to the ground and knocked unconscious.\nMinutes after the fight ended, a lone 911 caller rang authorities to report the brawl.\n\"At this point, everybody's running out, so it was before, about 20, 30 people, but everybody's out,\" the caller said.\nThroughout the three-minute, 15-second phone call, the 911 operator can be heard asking several times how many people were involved in the fight and whether police were needed at the scene.\n\"So you keep saying they left, do you need police to respond out?\" the dispatcher asked toward the end of the call.\nVIDEO OF RACIAL SLUR YELLED DURING THE BRUTAL CINCINNATI BEATDOWN EMERGES\n\"I would prefer, yes,\" the man said. \"I would prefer, yes.

I got attacked by multiple people,\" a man in a polo green shirt is seen telling a Cincinnati Police Department officer.\n\"What led up to the fight?\" the officer is heard asking.\n\"Don't really know,\" the man replied, sounding dazed. \"It just got out of the bar and it just got crazy.\"\nCINCINNATI BRAWL TIMELINE: BRUTAL ASSAULT SPIRALS INTO NATIONAL FIRESTORM\n\"Okay, you didn't get into it with anybody inside the bar?\" the officer replied.\n\"No, no, no,\" the man replied. \"Not at all. I got side-punched. It wasn't a fair fight at all.\"\nIt wasn't a fair fight at all\u2026\nIn another officer's body camera video, also obtained by Fox News Digital, a female Cincinnati Police Department officer is heard asking witnesses if the \"argument was about wings.\"\nThroughout the footage, a group of individuals is seen purchasing and disputing wings at a local food truck in the early morning hours of Saturday, July 26.\n\"Are they fighting about wings?\" the officer is heard asking as the officers arrive at the scene.\n\"I heard it was the one white guy who called the guy a n-----,\" a man replied.\n\"Do you know who swung first?\" the woman asked.\nThe update comes the same day all six individuals arrested in connection with the viral beating in downtown Cincinnati have been indicted by a grand jury and are facing additional charges.\nPatrick Rosemond, 38, Jermaine Matthews, 39, Montianez Merriweather, 34, DeKyra Vernon, 24, Dominique Kittle, 37, and Aisha Devaughn, 25, are each charged with three counts of alleged felonious assault, three charges of assault and two charges of aggravated rioting, the Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office confirmed to Fox News Digital.\n\"What I saw on video is not the Cincinnati I know and love,\" Hamilton County Prosecutor Connie Pillich said. \"These charges hold those involved in the attack accountable.\"\nThe update comes nearly two weeks after a bystander video showing the brutal beatdown on the corner of Fourth and Elm streets went viral, sparking national outrage and forcing local leaders to answer for the beating that broke out around 3 a.m. on July 26.\nWitness video obtained by Fox News Digital shows a man repeatedly yelling racial slurs at a group before being violently thrown to the ground and kicked repeatedly.\n\"I saw a little ruckus going on, saw people kind of scuffling, so kind of zoomed in, and once my phone kind of focused in, I saw the so-called victims being pretty aggressive toward the group of people that were already standing out there,\" witness Jay Black told Fox News Digital.\nCINCINNATI RESIDENTS ON EDGE AFTER VIRAL BEATDOWN SPARKS CRIME CONCERNS: 'WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN NEXT?'\nBlack added that he watched the man get knocked to the ground, before getting up and start fighting again.\n\"Once he got up, you know people were kind of backing off of him, but he was kind of still going at people, you know, and using racial slurs,\" Black said.\nHe told Fox News Digital that \"contrary to what people think,\" there were actually \"a lot of people\" trying to break up the fight.\nThe fight ignited a national firestorm as local leaders were left to answer for the apparent lack of police presence in the downtown area when the fight occurred after it was revealed that only 11 officers were stationed downtown the night of the brawl.\nCINCINNATI MAYOR UNDER FIRE FOR POLICE MANAGEMENT AFTER VIRAL BEATING EXPOSES LAX BAIL LAWS\nIn a press conference held last week, Cincinnati Police Chief Theresa Theetge revealed that, of the approximately 100 individuals present on the street corner at the time of the fight, only one person called 911.\n\"That is unacceptable to not call the police,\" Theetge said. \"Traffic was horrendous. People saw this. They were fighting in front of traffic. Why didn't people call us?\"\nOne of the victims in the attack, Holly, can be seen in additional footage being violently slammed to the ground and knocked unconscious as she tried to split up the fight.\n\"I remember being afraid, terrified,\" Holly told Fox News Digital. \"I just remember my life flashing before my eyes, and all I can think is, \u2018Dear God, I hope my children know that I love them.\u2019\"\nCINCINNATI VIRAL BEATING VICTIM SAYS VIOLENT MOB STARTED ATTACKING 'LIKE A PACK OF WOLVES'\nHolly revealed the horrific fight left her with brain damage and life-altering injuries, including a severe concussion.\n\"I'm having someone help take care of me financially, mentally and physically,\" Holly said. \"It's very humbling, it's very embarrassing to not be able to just be able to hang out by myself. I think that's the scary part, to not know just how deep the damage is going to be.\"\nCincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval also weighed in on the violence that lit up social media at a press conference last week.\nVIDEO OF RACIAL SLUR YELLED DURING THE BRUTAL CINCINNATI BEATDOWN EMERGES\n\"This was an awful incident, and our law enforcement has been working quickly and effectively to bring all responsible to justice,\" he said while standing alongside other city officials and leaders. \"Let me be clear, there is no place for violent crime in Cincinnati, whether it's a fight or gun violence. We will pursue those responsible and we will hold them accountable no matter who they are.\"\nHowever, Pureval has since come under fire for his handling of the city\u2019s law enforcement, with mayoral challenger Cory Bowman, who is also Vice President JD Vance\u2019s half-brother, slamming city leadership for what he believes is relaxed bail policies allowing violent offenders back on the streets.\nCINCINNATI BUSINESS OWNERS SLAM VIRAL 'OUT OF CONTROL' BEATING AMID FIGHT TO CLEAN UP DOWNTOWN\n\"There are things from City Hall that are showing that the police are not supported the way they need to,\" Bowman told Fox News Digital. \"They are unable to do their jobs because they've been told time and time again that they have to use restraint in certain things instead of enforcing the law. They're told to dial back, and then what happens is that we have prosecutors and judges that have a catch-and-release system.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIn a previous statement, Council Member Anna Albi also condemned the brutal beating, while vowing to support the community\u2019s police force.\n\"Under no circumstances is it ever acceptable to condone such awful violence,\" Albi said. \"Our greatest responsibility as elected officials and city leaders is to ensure the safety of our community. That is why this City Council continues to invest in supporting and growing our police force while simultaneously investing in social services to foster safe and healthy communities.\"\nIf convicted, the suspects face the possibility of 29.5 years in prison.\nFox News Digital's Peter D'Abrosca contributed to this report."
