  "content": "New leaks from Evan Blass, a technology blogger and prominent leaker, reveal that Lenovo is working to raise the bar for handheld gaming PCs with its Legion Go 2. New images and information detail a device with a screen that could set a new standard for the market.\n\nAccording to Blass, the Legion Go successor's screen is an OLED panel\u2014a significant step up from the Legion Go's LCD. It is also designed with a native landscape orientation, which is a technical choice that avoids the visual glitches and \"weirdness\" that can affect screens repurposed from smartphones, The Verge reports. The new display has a variable refresh rate and is rated for a sustained brightness of 500 nits, with a peak of 1000 nits.\n\nBeyond the screen, Blass says the Legion Go 2 will have a more powerful AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor, a bigger 74Wh battery, and up to 32GB of LPDDR5X RAM. The design has also reportedly been made more ergonomic with improved airflow.\n\nThe Legion Go 2's price is bound to be higher than the first Legion Go. We'll hopefully get a number this weekend when Lenovo unveils the new handheld at IFA 2025.",
