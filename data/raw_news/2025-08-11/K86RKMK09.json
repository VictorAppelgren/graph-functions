  "description": "Under Robert F. Kennedy Jr., federal officials may withdraw an endorsement for the vaccine in younger children.",
  "content": "Under Robert F. Kennedy Jr., federal officials may withdraw an endorsement for the vaccine in younger children.\n\nThis fall, it may not be possible for many parents to have a healthy child under age 5 immunized against Covid. Pfizer\u2019s vaccine has long been available to these children under so-called emergency use authorization. But the Food and Drug Administration is considering discontinuing the authorization for that age group, according to an email sent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to state and local health departments. Pfizer confirmed the possibility on Monday evening and said that the company was \u201ccurrently in discussions with the agency on potential paths forward.\u201d For children 5 to 11 years old, the Pfizer vaccine is expected to be approved and available, according to the C.D.C.\u2019s email, which was reviewed by The New York Times. In July, the F.D.A. granted full approval to Moderna\u2019s Covid vaccine for children \u2014 but only for those who have health conditions that may put them at increased risk should they become infected. Novavax\u2019s Covid vaccine has never been available for children under 12.\n\nThe upshot is that if the F.D.A. does not renew Pfizer\u2019s authorization for children 6 months to 4 years, or fully approve the vaccine, healthy children in that age group will have no officially sanctioned options \u2014 although doctors may still choose to provide the vaccine \u201coff label.\u201d That the F.D.A. might rescind the authorization was first reported by The Guardian. \u201cUnfortunately, this leaves one of the vulnerable groups, specifically healthy children less than 2 years old, without access to a safe vaccine that\u2019s known to prevent hospitalization and death,\u201d said Dr. Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, who oversaw the C.D.C.\u2019s work group on the Covid vaccine before she resigned in June. The risk of severe illness and hospitalization among children under 1 who are infected with the coronavirus is comparable to that among adults 65 and older. That\u2019s why experts have said that a child\u2019s first exposure should be through a vaccine, rather than infection. A late-summer Covid wave is moving across the nation, even as children are preparing to return to school. Fortunately, hospitalization rates remain low. In May, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the health secretary, announced that Covid vaccines would no longer be offered to healthy children or pregnant women. Mr. Kennedy has called the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines dangerous. In May 2021, in the thick of the pandemic, he filed a petition with the F.D.A. demanding that the agency revoke authorization for the shots.\n\nThe C.D.C., which typically makes such recommendations, later walked back the secretary\u2019s statement, saying that healthy children could get the shot if a doctor agreed that it was needed. Moderna told the C.D.C. it was ramping up supplies of its vaccine for the fall, according to the agency\u2019s email. But it is not approved for healthy children, and if the F.D.A. rescinds authorization for children under 5, parents of healthy children will find themselves with no options. Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, declined to comment on potential regulatory changes and said any reports before an official statement should be treated as \u201cspeculation.\u201d \u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic ended with the expiration of the federal public health emergency in May 2023,\u201d Mr. Nixon said. But public health experts noted that the coronavirus is still a threat, even for otherwise healthy children under 2. Among children ages 6 months to 2 years who were hospitalized with Covid from October 2022 to April 2024, more than half had no underlying medical conditions, according to data from the C.D.C.\n\nThe vaccines have also been shown to offer modest protection against long Covid in some children. The effects are already becoming apparent. Providers have stopped ordering last year\u2019s shot, as they often do at this time of the year. Normally by this point, there would be a clear plan for the 2025-26 season. Leanne Cronic-Powell, 36, a lawyer for a software company in Medford, Mass., called four clinics but could not find one that could offer the Covid vaccine to her daughter later this month. Anticipating that the shots might be difficult to find in the fall, Ms. Cronic-Powell had opted to have her 8-month-old daughter, Ripley, immunized in June, soon after she was eligible. Ripley has received two of the three Pfizer doses in the primary series but cannot receive the third, which is due on Aug. 22. \u201cI\u2019m really frustrated, because we\u2019ve tried do out best to do some form of coverage for our daughter,\u201d she said. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re being thwarted at every turn.\u201d The Massachusetts Department of Public Health, when Ms. Cronic-Powell turned to it for guidance, was not any wiser.",

      "text": "Pfizer\u2019s Covid vaccine for young children may not be renewed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) this fall, prompting Moderna to fill possible gaps in supply, according to an email obtained by the Guardian.\nThe move would pull the only remaining Covid vaccine for all children under five from the market.\nThe Moderna vaccine is only approved for children with one or more health conditions, and the pediatric Covid vaccine from Novavax is only available for children aged 12 and up with health conditions.\n\u201cIt certainly would create a hole in the availability of vaccines,\u201d said Georges Benjamin, the executive director of the American Public Health Association.\n\u201cAnd to do it this late in the season \u2013 I think clearly it\u2019s inappropriate.\u201d\nAccording to an email from the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD), Pfizer said the FDA recently informed the pharmaceutical company that it may not renew the emergency use authorization for its pediatric Covid vaccine for the 2025 respiratory season.\nThe email was sent on Friday to state and local vaccination grantees.\nThe Pfizer vaccine is given to children between the ages of six months and four years.\nPfizer expects its Covid vaccine for children aged five to 11 to be fully licensed this fall, the email said.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is \u201cin discussions\u201d with Moderna about rapidly increasing its Covid vaccine supply for young children, according to the email.\nThat includes internal planning about volume, timing and potential supply gaps.\n\u201cWe are working to ensure there will be sufficient supply,\u201d said Chris Ridley, a Moderna spokesperson.\nPfizer did not respond to media inquiries by publication time.\nOn Monday, communications director for the US Department for Health and Human Services (HHS), Andrew Nixon, told the Guardian: \u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic ended with the expiration of the federal public health emergency in May 2023. We do not comment on potential, future regulatory changes. Unless officially announced by HHS, discussion about future agency action should be regarded as pure speculation.\u201d\nIn July, Moderna received FDA approval of its Covid pediatric shot. But the vaccine was only approved for children with one or more health conditions that make them more vulnerable to Covid. This move could limit access to Covid vaccines.\n\u201cWe already have a low number of people using the vaccines to start with,\u201d Benjamin said.\n\u201cThere hasn\u2019t been enough promotion of vaccinations for kids, and then you have Mr [Robert F] Kennedy\u2019s [Jr] unscientific statements about the safety and efficacy of vaccines, particularly Covid vaccines, for both pregnant women and kids. It has muddied the waters of what people know about the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.\u201d\nThe vaccine is extremely effective, especially against hospitalization and death.\nYet only 5.6% of children aged six months to four years are vaccinated against Covid, and about 15% of children aged five to 17 are vaccinated, according to the CDC.\nWhile older adults have the highest rates of hospitalization and death, children continue seeing hospitalization rates from Covid similar to rates in 2020 and 2021.\nAnd there are other concerns with Covid infection.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know the long-term impact for kids who have gotten Covid as a disease. We do know it does cause a multi-systemic inflammatory process in a number of kids, which is very severe, and we don\u2019t know the long-term implications for long Covid in kids,\u201d Benjamin said.\nCovid cases are rising in many parts of the US amid other vaccine restrictions proposed and implemented by health officials."
