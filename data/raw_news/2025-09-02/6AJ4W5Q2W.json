  "description": "The best adjustable dumbbells provide access to a range of weights without the unwanted clutter. We spoke with experts to find sets that are comfortable and reliable.",
  "content": "Working out with weights is a great way to tone and strengthen muscles, and a pair of dumbbells opens the door to countless exercises that target your entire body. Sadly, investing in all the dumbbells you need means sacrificing a lot of free space at home and spending a lot of money along the way. That is unless you pick up a set of the best adjustable dumbbells that replace multiple sets and make it easy to change weights on the fly. We surveyed the market and spoke with the experts before naming the Core Home Fitness Adjustable Dumbbells the best set you can buy right now, and we\u2019ve highlighted five other adjustable sets that are also great.\n\nWhile you\u2019ll surely pay more for a set of adjustable dumbbells up front, that one-time purchase replaces multiple fixed sets, and it can even convince you to ditch a pricey gym membership. Perfect for the fitness enthusiast who lives in an apartment or smaller space, or for anyone who just wants to minimize their home gym setup, adjustable dumbbells let you work harder and smarter at the same time. Below you\u2019ll find the six sets of dumbbells we recommend, along with buying advice to help you find a pair that meets your needs.\n\nIn a matter of seconds and using just one hand, these adjustable dumbbells from Core Home Fitness can transition from five to 50 pounds, or set to any five-pound increment in between. While resting in their lightweight aluminum cradles, the weights feature a twist-and-lock adjustment mechanism that\u2019s reliable and easy to use. I should know\u2014I\u2019ve been using adjustable dumbbells from Core Home Fitness for many years now. And despite treating them a bit rough every now and then, I\u2019ve never had trouble adjusting weights on the fly. This set features thick handles that are contoured and lightly textured, ensuring you get a firm and comfortable grip, and while slightly bulky for some exercises like standard curls, they\u2019re compact enough for just about any movement and exercise. While not exactly cheap, this set can easily replace 10 pairs of weights if not more, so they\u2019re a lot less expensive than a full set.\n\nA Heavy Set That's Lighter On Your Wallet Keep in mind that when we talk about products with a high value, we\u2019re not talking about the cheapest product you can find, but rather, the best intersection of quality and price. So, while this $250 set of dumbbells from Rendpas certainly isn\u2019t cheap, it\u2019s a savvy buy that replaces five sets of weights. The max weight of 55 pounds is sufficient if you\u2019re looking for a challenge, though the lowest possible dumbbell you get here might be too heavy for some at 15 pounds. With that said, each weight option between those two increments of 15 and 55 pounds is a pleasure to use\u2014as much as hard work can be, anyway\u2014as these are solid and reliable weights. A quick one-handed rotation is all it takes to pivot between weight options, and the dumbbells are well-balanced and have a textured grip, so any exercises you want to work at will be safe and comfortable.\n\nThe gear team at Forbes Vetted consists of writers and editors with dozens of years of combined experience covering exercise and fitness topics. From Garmin running watches to protein powders to golf shorts, we maintain a library of in-depth guides to help you find the products you need to get active.\n\u2022 This guide was written by Forbes Vetted staff writer Steven John, who has more than 13 years of experience as a journalist. He\u2019s relied on adjustable dumbbells as part of his workout routine for more than five years.\n\u2022 This guide was reviewed by Forbes Vetted gear editor Cam Vigliotta, a fitness enthusiast with a background in kinesiology. He owns a set of BowFlex SelectTech Dumbbells and uses them regularly as part of his strength training regimen.\n\u2022 John spoke to exercise and fitness experts to learn more about adjustable dumbbells. These include: BowFlex fitness advisor Amy Kiser Schemper, MS, CPT; Reig McConnell, personal trainer, nutrition coach and founder of Reig McConnell Coaching; and Christy Swaid, founder and health coach at Checkered Flag Living.\n\u2022 We know fitness fads come and go faster than you can adjust a set of dumbbells, which is why we revisit this guide to ensure it\u2019s accurate and up-to-date. It was fist published in September 2025.\n\nHow We Chose The Best Adjustable Dumbbells\n\nAuthor of this guide Steven John has been using adjustable dumbbells as part of his workout routine for years, but he and Forbes Vetted gear team looked well beyond the sets they know to find options that meet a range of fitness needs.\n\u2022 We started by establishing what constitutes an adjustable dumbbell, as opposed to a traditional dumbbell; for our purposes, an adjustable dumbbell is one that features multiple weights and a locking mechanism that can be used to secure (or drop) weight increments.\n\u2022 From there, we considered how much weight an adjustable dumbbell should offer in order to be useful through a range of workouts, looking for options that offer weights in excess of 50 pounds and smaller 3- or 5-pound increments.\n\u2022 We noted the value offered by adjustable dumbbell sets, keeping in mind that even though this is expensive hardware, it can replace multiple sets of weights that would cost much more and take up more space.\n\u2022 We reviewed options from dozens of different brands based on insights we received from fitness experts. We also reflected on our own experience using adjustable dumbbells and what we look for in a reliable set.\n\nWhat To Look For In The Best Adjustable Dumbbells\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to maximize the efficiency of your workouts and workout space, here\u2019s what to consider as you shop for adjustable dumbbells.\n\nIt might seem obvious, but if your adjustable dumbbells don\u2019t offer weights heavy enough to challenge you\u2014or light enough for you to lift with confidence\u2014they aren\u2019t going to be effective or enjoyable. Try to choose a set that offers a maximum weight of at least 10 or 15 pounds above what you currently use for your preferred dumbbell exercises, and that has a low enough weight option for you to do precision workouts that target smaller muscle groups.\n\nNot all adjustable dumbbells are created equal when it comes to the amount of physical space they take up. If you\u2019re trying to plan a fitness routine in a decidedly small area, space should be a primary concern. \u201cYou can make health a priority in many different spaces and situations\u2026 and I have good experiences with adjustable dumbbells,\u201d says Swaid. Weight is weight, so I prefer space-saving designs.\" To that end, it\u2019s often wise to choose the smallest physical set of dumbbells that still offer the weights your workouts require.\n\nDumbbell size can also be an issue in terms of suitability for the user, says McConell. \u201cMany are on the bulkier side, so if you are a smaller person, you may struggle with the size and design.\u201d\n\nGo too cheap on adjustable dumbbells and you might be treading into unsafe territoty. \u201cLook for secure components reinforced with durable parts and a locking system to keep weights in place,\u201d says Kiser. \u201cAlso look for dumbbells that feature a comfortable grip with an ergonomic, non-slip handle, providing extra control and comfort with each lift.\"\n\n\u201cOne potential drawback is the cost, as adjustable dumbbells are a more significant financial investment upfront,\u201d says Kiser. \u201cHowever,\u201d she adds, \u201cwhen you do the math on buying multiple sets of dumbbells on their own, or a gym membership, the adjustable dumbbells are saving you money long term.\u201d Again, just make sure they will offer the heavier and lighter weights that you need to meet all of your needs.",

      "text": "I\u2019m a staff writer focused on gear and tech based near New York City.\nJul 18, 2025, 01:42pm EDT\nWeighted vests have a myriad of health benefits\u2014some of which might surprise you. Sure, weighted vests can help you build muscle and improve cardiovascular health by making walks, jogs or circuit training more challenging, but did you know that a weighted vest can even help with weight loss and bone density? At Forbes Vetted, we know these benefits firsthand: I\u2019m the gear and tech writer, and I\u2019ve worn weighted vests during workouts and training; I also interviewed colleagues and learned that many of them have worn weighted vests, themselves. So after tapping into our own experiences (and researching multiple options), we named the TRX Hexgrip Weighted Vestas the best weighted vest overall. Thanks to its secure fit that doesn\u2019t limit your range of motion, it\u2019s a good choice for anyone committed to improved health and fitness.\nAll that said, weighted vests are not uniform in fit, form or function. For example, the best weighted vest for intense strength training might not be comfortable while walking or jogging. Some weighted vests can be too bulky for smaller bodies, while others are simply too light for larger folks. I\u2019ve broken down the best weighted vests by category, and spoken to several health and fitness experts with knowledge of weighted vest benefits and when to use them.\nThe Hexgrip Weighted Vest from TRX is unique in that it can be quite heavy, yet it isn\u2019t that bulky. The vest comes in 20- and 40-pound options, yet even when loaded with its full complement of weights (which come in one-pound increments for the 20-pound vest and two-pounders for the heavier option), the vest will have minimal impact on your rage of motion, as it leaves your arms free to move and sits quite snugly on the body. The vest does so thanks to adjustable straps at both the shoulders and waist, so it can be adjusted to suit various torso shapes and sizes.\nThat secure fit also ensures even distribution of the weight, so your balance won\u2019t be thrown off while you wear it. While this vest is a bit too bulky for comfortable wear during all workouts, such as sprints, trail runs or some HIIT work (High Intensity Interval Training) it will work quite well for walks or jogs, squats or deadlifts, pull-ups or pushups and many other types of exercise, especially those reliant on bodyweight training. Just make sure to secure each individual weight in its pocket with care, as some verified users of the Hexgrip vest have reported weights slipping out of place during exercise.\nThis weighted vest from ProsourceFit won\u2019t be a hit to your bank account, but it will be a hit with anyone looking to add some weight to their workouts. Its minimalist design makes the vest a good choice for use on long walks, and the mesh pouch on the back of the vest can be used to stash a phone, keys or an energy bar. That said, it does tend to bounce around easily, largely because of the elasticity of the shoulder straps, so if you\u2019re looking for a weighted vest for use during runs or highly active exercise, shop on.\nThe vest features two chest straps\u2014one a bit above the belly and one at the sternum\u2014that can be used to create a secure fit for most people, and the fact that the weight comes from sand spread out in various pockets means an even and comfortable distribution of weight. Some people have reported that the stitching wears out on some parts of the vest after extended use, so if you\u2019re looking for a weighted vest you can use often, for a long time to come, you may want to consider one that\u2019s more expensive but potentially more durable.\nIdeal for sprints, HIIT, bodyweight training and more\nCons:\nWeighs less than other vests in its class\nThe G-Vest from Omorpho is so flexible and pliant that you can wear it during almost any exercise, including those with a lot of high-speed motion. It\u2019s a great choice to use during sprint training, high intensity interval exercise, bodyweight workouts or as you deadlift or squat. The vest is so comfortable you may well forget you\u2019re even wearing it at times. Small steel ball bearings are spread out evenly across the vest, so it feels balanced and without added bulk, while adjustable shoulder straps and cinch cords at your sides allow for a snug, secure fit.\nAt 10 pounds, this vest doesn\u2019t add a lot of weight, but if you wear it all the time when you\u2019re training, you\u2019ll feel the difference when it\u2019s time to go for a run or complete a workout without it. The G-Vest is an expensive weighted vest to be sure, but it just might be the most comfortable and least restrictive training vest you ever own.\nBest Adjustable Weighted Vest\nChoose Your Challenge\nSportneer Weighted Vest\nWeight options: 2 to 18 pounds, 2 to 40 pounds | Adjustment options: Shoulder straps, waist belt | Materials: Neoprene, polyester\nPros:\nCustomizable weight\nFit for walks and bodyweight training\nReflective; good for nighttime workout routines\nCons:\nToo bulky for running and HIIT\nThis weighted training vest from Sportneer lets you select the amount of weight you strap onto yourself, and you can adjust that weight by two-pound increments up to 20 pounds. (The company also offers an adjustable weight vest with a 40-pound capacity.) This is a bit bulkier of a vest and won\u2019t be great for running or HIIT, but for walks or bodyweight exercise, it\u2019s a great choice that you can use to keep upping the challenge as you get into ever better shape.\nAnd because the vest has reflective elements on the front and back, it\u2019s a good choice for those nighttime walks. The vest zips on easily and can be adjusted for a tighter fit with shoulder straps and a waistband. It can be secured to torsos as small as 28 inches around, or as big as 55 inches around, so chances are good that it will fit your body.\nBest Weighted Vest For Women\nHardware Designed For Her\nEmpower Weighted Vest\nWeight options: 8, 10 and 16 pounds | Adjustment options: Side straps | Materials: Neoprene, polyester\nPros:\nComfortable X-shaped design\nAdjustable strap above the waist\nCustomizable weight\nCons:\nFairly strong chemical smell upon unboxing\nThis weighted vest from Empower was specifically designed with the female body in mind. And in fact, it was designed for women by women. The vest easily and comfortably fits the contours of a woman\u2019s body and can be adjusted for a perfect fit thanks to side straps set below the bust but well above the waist. The weight can be adjusted from 1o to 16 pounds (there is also an option for a non-adjustable eight-pound vest from Empower), so you can tailor your challenge based on your exercise goals for the day.\nIt\u2019s an especially good idea for women in or approaching middle age to wear a weighted vest like this for a portion of each day, as the added pressure on bones leads to greater bone density and better bone health over time, helping to allay the all-too-common issues of osteoporosis. You can wear a weighted vest while going hard at the gym, but you can also benefit from wearing one as you stroll the neighborhood or play with the kids.\nBest Heavy Weighted Vest\nFor Doing The Hard Work\nZFOsports Weighted Vest\nWeight options: 30 and 80 pounds | Adjustment options: Side straps, shoulder straps | Materials: Polyester\nPros:\nWeighs up to 80 pounds\nGood for wrestling and martial arts training\nFeatures a pocket for your water bottle and phone\nCons:\nTakes more time than average to adjust to your ideal fit\nIf you\u2019re looking to add some serious weight to your workout routine, like the kind of weight one might use when training for a strongman competition, wrestling and martial arts, or an extreme undertaking like a remote mountaineering expedition, this weighted vest from ZFOsports is a great choice. With the ability to carry up to 80 pounds, it makes workouts much more challenging, and you can start with less weight and work up to the max over time.\nIt can take a while to get this vest dialed in, according to reviews from many verified buyers, but once you get the weights placed where you want them (more weight in the back works better for running, for example) and get the straps cinched just right, it will stay secure on your torso and enhance every workout. Plus, there\u2019s a spot for securing a water bottle to the front of the vest and a pocket for a phone, keys and snacks, so you can stay hydrated and lightly equipped while you\u2019re heavily weighted.\nHere at Forbes Vetted, we thoroughly evaluate every product that\u2019s featured in our many gear guides, which are a culmination of hours of research, hands-on testing and expert insights. We\u2019re also particularly passionate about fitness equipment.\nThis article was written by Forbes Vetted staff writer Steven John, who specializes in tech and gear and has worn weighted vests (and weighted shorts, for that matter) many times over the course of his workouts and training.\nForbes Vetted gear editor Cam Vigliotta oversees this guide and our library of gear content. With a background rooted in kinesiology, he has spent years testing a variety of fitness machines and apparel, and he personally understands the importance of using quality equipment.\nIn preparing this story, John spoke to multiple fitness experts, including Chris Pruitt, CEO of WorkoutHealthy, Leon Veal, head of research, development and innovation at Styrkr, and James Kennedy, general manager and trainer at Anytime Fitness.\nWe update this guide periodically to evaluate new weighted vests and update information on our current top picks. It was last updated in July 2025 by gear updates writer Alexandra Garrett who added product details and refreshed the section of FAQs.\nHow We Chose The Best Weighted Vests\nTo find the best weighted vests, we performed product research, consulted with experts and drew upon our experience using weighted vests and other fitness equipment.\nJohn consulted with a gym manager, the CEO of a fitness equipment brand and the head of research and design at a sports fuel company to learn more about weighted vests and what you should think about before you buy one.\nWe considered different types of weighted vests that cater to adjustability, different body types and different activities. In doing so, we\u2019ve provided a range of options that meet specific needs, whether you\u2019re running, walking lifting or otherwise challenging your body.\nWe also took into account elements such as fit, weight options, exercise compatibility, special features and cost to ensure our recommendations are well-rounded and cost effective.\nWhat To Look For In The Best Weighted Vests\nWeighted vests can have a huge impact on your workout routine. \u201cWhether you\u2019re doing push-ups, squats, lunges or even just going for a brisk walk, the extra resistance can challenge you without throwing off your movement patterns,\u201d says Veal. That said, before you can reap the benefits of a weighted vest, you need to first identify the right one for your needs. Below, we break down four of the most important factors to consider to help narrow down your options.\nSecure Fit\nThere\u2019s a sweet spot when it comes to proper weighted vest fit: You need one that fits snugly onto your torso so it doesn\u2019t shift and jostle as you move, but it can\u2019t be so tight as to be restrictive. \u201cYou want a vest that is snug and form-fitting so that it\u2019s comfortable and won\u2019t shift during your workouts,\u201d says Kennedy. \u201cAt the same time, it\u2019s important to find a vest that is not overly restrictive in terms of movement or blood flow. It\u2019s a fine line but one that can make or break a weighted-vest workout.\u201d\nWeight\nUsing a weighted vest properly does not mean loading it with as you can manage. In fact, often going with lighter weight that allows for more vigorous exercise is the better move. And lighter weight is key when you\u2019re first starting off with vests. \u201cWhen it comes to best-use practices, it\u2019s really important to ease into using a weighted vest rather than strapping on the heaviest one you can find,\" says Veal. \u201cStart with a lighter weight which is around five to 10% of your bodyweight.\u201d\nExercise Type\nThe best weighted vest for someone training for a weight lifting competition may be a terrible choice for someone training for a half marathon, and vice versa. \u201cTo use weighted vests effectively, consider if you\u2019re doing bodyweight exercises like push-ups, pull-ups and squats, or strength circuits or brisk walks,\u201d says Pruitt. Consider the flexibility, weight capacity and adjustment features of any weighted vest you are considering.\nSpecial Features\nIf you are torn between two weighted vests and can\u2019t decide which is the right one for you, look beyond the basics of weight and fit, and consider any special features. These can include things like high-visibility reflective elements that improve safety while out for a jog or walk at night, a pocket for a phone or energy bar and a water bottle pouch. Many weighted vests feature little extras like these that might just make them the best pick for you.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nAccording to our research, the TRX Hexgrip Weighted Vest is the best choice for most people. Due to its heavy design and secure fit that doesn\u2019t limit range of motion, it\u2019s well-suited to tackle a plethora of cardio-focused routines. This includes walking and jogging, as well as workouts that prioritize strength training like squats, deadlifts and pull-ups.\nWhen determining your ideal weighted vest, keep your bodyweight and fitness level in mind. Fitness experts, including Veal, recommend that beginners start off with lighter-weight option before working up to a heavier vest\u2014a good rule of thumb is to start with a vest that\u2019s between five and 10% of your body weight. For example, a 20 pound vest may be a good starting pick for someone that weighs around 200 pounds; however, it may be a tad too heavy for a beginner who weighs closer to 150 pounds.\nYes, a weighted vest is an effective tool to help you build muscle strength, improve cardiovascular health and increase calorie burn by making your body work harder during your fitness routine. Wearing a weighted vest can also boost bone density by stimulating bone remodeling\u2014a process that involves breaking down old bone tissue and forming new, stronger bones.\nWearing a weighted vest increases the load put on your bones, stimulating bone remodeling. This process involves the breakdown of old bone tissue and the formation of new, stronger bone. Gains are usually most pronounced in the spine and hips.\nNo, in fact most experts recommend against wearing weighted vests for long periods of time. They are best worn for periods of less than an hour, and with long breaks in between sessions. When used properly, a weighted vest is a great addition to your workout routines and overall healthy lifestyle."

Whether you\u2019re looking for workouts from Amy, nutrition guidance from Vivian, or have a question for Kurt, we are here for you!\nThe Story So Far\nPERSONAL TRAINER + FITNESS INSTRUCTOR\nGrowing up as an athlete and performer, I was always passionate about fitness and helping others. While in college, I became a certified personal trainer and group fitness instructor, then began a career working in gyms with all types of clients and classes.\nTHE START OF BODYFIT BY AMY\nAfter years of working as a trainer and fitness instructor in gyms, my husband suggested we start a fitness YouTube channel in 2014. We cleared some space, bought some camera gear, and started making videos on the weekend, while also both working full time. That first year we made 100 videos, and we learned a lot, and wanted to keep the community growing.\nwhat i did next\nAs we grew and the BodyFit by Amy community expanded, we added a monthly email and workout calendar and released several ebooks and programs. My workouts have always reflected where I am today, so when I got pregnant with my first child it was natural for me to shoot and share prenatal and postnatal videos. Through my own journey, I was able to connect with moms around the world during their pregnancy and postpartum journeys.\nthe other thing that happened\nThe BodyFit by Amy channel and community continued to grow organically, but when the pandemic hit in March of 2020, it went to an entirely different level. This community was a lifeline for me, and I felt like in a small way I was able to do my part by providing an online space for fitness.\nwhere I\u2019m going\nThe experience of 2020 showed me that the BodyFit community could have an even greater transformational impact. Vivian, our registered dietitian, joined us full time and in January of 2021, we reimagined the traditional gym experience with an international, virtual gym by launching the BodyFit Athletic Club. The result has been amazing, with over 500 people joining in the first 4 months.\nThe journey never ends, join me?\nFree weekly & monthly\nWorkout calendars.\nDelivered straight to your inbox!"

      "text": "Whether you are prepping for a marathon, exploring trails for fun or using running as a part of your strength-training gains, there is a Garmin watch that can help with your goals. We think the Garmin Forerunner 970 is the best Garmin running watch overall because it includes several dozen preloaded guided activities and can track your biometrics during every run.\nIf you\u2019re less interested in preloaded workouts and activities and prefer to save some money, the Garmin Forerunner 55 is a solid fitness- and sleep-tracking watch with a long battery life that you can find for $200 or less. All of the Garmins on our list are quality running watches, but each showcases specific features and capabilities for the needs of different runners. To make these selections, we leaned into the expertise of our gear editorial team and also consulted with several fitness tech experts.\nCase size: 47mm | Weight: 2 ounces | Battery life: Up to 15 days | Water rating: 5 ATM\nThe Garmin Forerunner 970 comes preloaded with more than 30 activity profiles, so whether you prefer to run on the track, on the trail, on a treadmill or on the streets, this watch is ready to monitor your run and offer curated insights afterward. It weighs just 2 ounces, yet has a tough titanium bezel and a scratch-resistant sapphire crystal lens. It\u2019s safe to wear down to 50 meters underwater, so you can use this watch on dives, too. The Forerunner 970 tracks all the biometrics the casual to the advanced runner could want, such as heart rate, blood oxygen rate, calories burned and more.\nThis watch also keeps track of your movement and location, noting your step count and the distance you cover along with your real-time location and altitude. It\u2019s on the pricey side, but with a battery lasting up to 15 days per charge and ready compatibility with all sorts of external hardware including smartphones, heart-rate monitors, cadence sensors and more, it proves its usefulness. Also, there\u2019s a safety factor here. \u201cThe Forerunner 970 features an electrocardiogram (ECG) function, accessible through its companion app,\u201d says Sunaina Chopra, a rehabilitation sciences expert. \u201cThis feature tracks rhythm irregularities and can help flag early warning signs of heart conditions, such as atrial fibrillation,\u201d she adds.\nBest Affordable Garmin Running Watch\nA Solid Watch At An Entry-Level Price\nGarmin Forerunner 55\nCase size: 42mm | Weight: 1.3 ounces | Battery life: Up to 14 days | Water rating: 5 ATM\nAt just $200 (and sometimes well under from certain retailers), the Garmin Forerunner 55 smartwatch is a great device for thrifty runners who are ready to up their game. But don\u2019t think of this affordable Garmin watch as cut-rate in any way: It can accurately track your heart rate, monitor your sleep patterns and breathing, track steps, count how many calories you have burned and much more. And the Forerunner 55 pairs with your smartphone to unlock more advanced features, as well.\nWhile other Garmin watches come preloaded with more fitness and training programs and offer more advanced metrics and features (there\u2019s no altimeter on the 55, for example), this watch has plenty going for it, like a long battery life and excellent water resistance. It has a relatively small case size and only weighs 1.3 ounces, so it\u2019s a fine unisex watch that\u2019s suitable for smaller wrists. It comes in three color options, including a cheery Aqua that pops on your wrist.\nBest High-End Garmin Running Watch\nAnd Upscale Smartwatch That Does It All\nGarmin Marq Adventurer (Gen 2)\nCase size: 46mm | Weight: 3.2 ounces | Battery life: Up to 16 days | Water rating: 10 ATM\nYes, the Garmin Marq Adventurer (Gen 2) is an expensive smartwatch, at more than $2,000 (or over $3,000 for the Damascus steel edition of the watch), but it offers everything a runner could ever want in terms of data tracking. And it doesn\u2019t just track your runs, it gives you actionable real time data, telling you when you need to push harder, to scale back or to stay the course in order to maximize your productivity and achieve your fitness, speed and timing goals. It also has you covered if you\u2019re a skier, surfer, climber, golfer, cyclist, rower and so much more.\nAnd this truly smart watch doesn\u2019t do all that just by monitoring your heart rate, blood oxygen levels and other biometrics\u2014it also accounts for things like altitude, elevation and heat, factoring in how the elements and the terrain impact your training as well as your safety and well-being. Even aside from fitness, the Marq Adventurer offers executive-level functionality, following up to 50 stocks, storing playlists from such services as Spotify and Amazon Music and, of course, handling messaging and notifications.\nBest Women's Garmin Running Watch\nPowerful Without Bulk\nGarmin Forerunner 570\nCase size: 42 or 47 mm | Weight: 1.5 or 1.8 ounces | Battery life: Up to 11 days | Water rating: 5 ATM\nWhile all Garmin running watches are unisex, the 1.4-ounce, 42mm Forerunner 570 is sized well for anyone who prefers a more lightweight device. \u201cIts [lightweight] aluminum design makes it practically unnoticeable on the wrist, a big win for those of us who don\u2019t want a bulky watch weighing us down,\u201d says Chopra. This watch is also compatible with menstrual-cycle tracking apps, per exercise scientist and health and wellness consultant Domenic Angelino. Those sorts of metrics\u2014added to the tracking of heart rate, steps, distance, blood oxygen levels and more\u2014can help female athletes excel during training runs as well as when it\u2019s time to compete.\nAnd the Forerunner 570 is much more than just a fitness tool. It can be used for mobile payments, to play music, to share weather reports and to guide you on your way, thanks to its GPS capabilities.\nBest Garmin Running Watch For Interval Training\nFor Tracking Intense Workouts\nGarmin Venu X1\nCase size: 41mm | Weight: 1.2 ounces | Battery life: Up to 8 days(11 days in Battery Saver mode) | Water rating: 5 ATM\nFitness expert Domenic Angelino says of the Garmin Venu X1: \u201cThis would be my go-to pick for anyone who plans to exercise in short, high-intensity bursts.\u201d He explains that \u201ca common issue \u2026 is that it\u2019s hard to read a bunch of watch data during the 30 seconds when you\u2019re resting in between bouts\u2026 This model addresses that by having a large and easy-to-read screen and a setup [that] helps you process information \u2026 easily, even when your brain isn\u2019t in the best place to do so.\u201d The rectangular shape of the Venu X1 makes viewing and processing information much faster and easier than on the round models, especially with the bright \u201calways-on\u201d screen option.\nThis watch collects and shares actionable data and can coach you through all sorts of fitness regimens: It comes preloaded with more than 100 sports apps. And it keeps tabs on you during every warmup, sprint or cooldown (and during nonrunning exercises, too), letting you know when to push harder and when to rein yourself in. Also, while the Venu X1\u2019s 2-inch display is the biggest Garmin offers, this watch weighs a mere 1.2 ounces, so it doesn\u2019t slow you down a bit.\nBest Trail-Running Garmin Watch\nWeeks and Weeks Of Battery Life\nGarmin Enduro 3\nCase size: 51mm | Weight: 2.2 ounces | Battery life: Up to 36 days | Water rating: 10 ATM\nThe main reason the Garmin Enduro 3 is a great watch for trail runners and hikers may not be the myriad maps it can access, the accuracy of its GPS tracking or its built-in LED flashlight. But those and other such outdoorsy features as a compass, thermometer and barometric altimeter make this a superb tool for hitting the trails. And the Enduro 3 also tracks your heart rate and steps and blood oxygen and such, so you have all the actionable training data you could want as you log miles out on the trail.\nThe most notable thing about this watch, that you can rely on when in the great outdoors, is its battery life. \u201cIt has a handful of unique safety and quality of life features that address some of the most common issues people face when working out in the wilderness,\u201d says Angelino. But what he really stresses is this: \u201cThe watch has an incredibly long battery life, [and] this is a safety feature that\u2019s helpful if you get lost or plan to go on a long route.\u201d That battery life can be up to 36 days under the right conditions\u2014when getting three hours of exposure to the sun each day\u2014as the watch has solar charging capabilities.\nThe gear team at Forbes Vetted has been testing, researching and writing about gear and technical apparel of all types for years, including hiking shoes, coolers and workout headphones.\nThis article was written by Forbes Vetted staff writer Steven John, who aside from 13-plus years of experience as a journalist, has been an avid outdoorsman for more than two decades and a regular runner for more than 15 years.\nThe piece is overseen by Forbes Vetted gear editor Cam Vigliotta, who is also a regular runner, hiker, skier and general outdoorsman. He frequently tests and reviews outdoor gear and clothing.\nForbes Vetted commerce editor Christine Colby edited this article. She has over five years of experience in product testing and recommendations, as well as 15-plus years in journalism. She recently spearheaded a test of the best patio umbrellas for Forbes Vetted.\nJohn spoke to several fitness tech experts for this story, including exercise scientist and health and wellness consultant Domenic Angelino; certified running coach Amanda Grimm of We Run; Sunaina Chopra, an MPT/Ph.D. candidate in the Rehabilitation Sciences program at the University of British Columbia; and certified fitness trainer Denise Chakoian.\nWe periodically revisit our content to update the product selections and to make sure pricing information is accurate. This version was first published in August 2025.\nHow We Chose The Best Garmin Running Watches\nWe made sure to recommend only the best Garmin watches that can improve the quality of your training, racing or your just-for-fun runs.\nWe researched the best-selling and top-rated Garmin watches and then determined which stood out as particularly good choices for use as part of a runner\u2019s kit.\nOur team identified several categories useful for active people, such as the best watch for trail running, the best for interval training and so forth.\nWe relied on our own expertise as experienced runners and hikers.\nWe spoke to the aforementioned experts (and to other members of the Forbes Vetted team) and asked their thoughts on using Garmin watches as a runner\u2019s tool and also for specific product recommendations to fit the categories we established.\nWe cross-referenced recommendations, research and the ratings and reviews left by verified buyers of each Garmin watch under consideration to help guide our ultimate selections.\nWhat To Look For When Shopping For The Best Garmin Running Watch For You\nAccording to certified fitness trainer Denise Chakoian, \u201cChoosing the best Garmin watch starts with the type of training you do. Distance runners, for example, need more battery life and GPS accuracy, while those focused on speed or interval training would prefer advanced performance metrics and recovery features.\u201d Here are the factors and features to keep in mind as you look for the right Garmin watch for your needs.\nBiometrics\nAll of the Garmin running watches covered here track at least a few key biometrics, like heart rate and blood oxygen levels, and these stats can help you make the most of your training, showing you when to push harder and when to take it slower. But some Garmin watches can also help you get a larger sense of your progress and your overall health. Consider whether such features as sleep trackers, body energy monitoring and the ability to keep tabs on your menstrual cycle are important for you.\nPreloaded Programs\nMany of the models come with programs runners love, such as an adaptive training program that acts like a digital running coach, guided daily workouts, goal-oriented programs focused on prepping for races and much more. The programs also go beyond running, including activities like golf, skiing, boating and more. If you find such guidance useful, consider upgrading to a Garmin running watch that includes these programs and coaching.\nDimensions\nIf you\u2019re wearing a watch on a hike or a leisurely jog, a larger watch size probably doesn\u2019t much matter. But if you\u2019re training for a race\u2014or if you have a smaller physique\u2014it certainly can. In those cases, certified running coach Amanda Grimm recommends that smaller runners look for a watch that\u2019s \u201csized for smaller wrists \u2026 and is comfortable to wear all day,\u201d so you get the most out of the watch while also not being tempted to take it off. Chakoian agrees, saying, \u201cIf a watch feels too heavy or bulky, it\u2019s not going to be something you want to wear every day.\u201d If you do opt for a smaller watch, make sure that you can still see the face well enough to get any pertinent data at a glance.\nBattery Life\nIf you\u2019re out for a daily run around your neighborhood or at the gym, then watch battery life really doesn\u2019t matter much, as you can charge at will each evening. If, however, you often travel or go on multi-day treks, it matters a lot, so make sure you consider whether a long battery life is an important feature for you.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nYes, Garmin watches are readily compatible with both the iOS operating system of Apple\u2019s iPhones and with Android smartphones. You can make use of all of the functions that a Garmin watch offers regardless of the type of smartphone you use.\nGarmin watches measure your stress levels by tracking heart-rate variability (HRV). HRV is the time interval occurring between consecutive heartbeats, and it accurately reflects the body\u2019s physiological response to stress. This metric is useful when you are technically at rest and is not accurate when you are actively exercising or have recently been physically exerting yourself.\nNo, not all Garmin watches offer a built-in GPS function. If you require it, be sure to check that the watch you are considering has this feature and that it works independently from your phone. That way, you can leave other devices behind when you want to be minimally encumbered while on a run."

      "text": "When deciding on the best kind of protein powder for you, it\u2019s important to consider your health and diet goals\u2014then find a formula that aligns with them. With help from nutritionists and fitness experts, we broke down four popular types of protein powders to help you decide on the best type for you. You\u2019ll also find our top product recommendations, from the whey-based Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard, which is ideal for building muscle, to the plant-based Orgain Organic Protein that\u2019s suitable for vegans and those sensitive to dairy.\nThere are a few factors you should keep in mind when choosing a formula, according to Forbes Vetted gear editor Cam Vigliotta, a fitness enthusiast who also authored our roundup of the best protein powders. \u201cI think anyone shopping for protein powder should consider the type of protein they want to consume, the flavors they prefer and how much they\u2019re willing to spend, which will impact the quality of the ingredients,\u201d he says. Below, we detail four common types of protein powder, along with the best use cases for each.\nAnimal-Based Protein Powder\nThe main types of animal-based protein powders are whey, casein and collagen. Whey and casein are derived from the by-products of animals, while collagen powder is extracted from the animal itself. There are also less common animal-based varieties for those with dairy sensitivities, including egg-based protein powder.\nWhey Protein Powder\nWhey is a type of protein derived from milk, specifically as a by-product of cheese production. It\u2019s considered a complete protein, which makes it great for post-workout recovery and muscle gain.\nBest for:\n- Post-workout recovery\n- Muscle growth\n- Improving athletic performance\nSkip if:\n- You\u2019re allergic to milk\n- You follow a vegan diet\nCasein Protein Powder\nSimilar to whey protein, casein protein is another supplement derived from milk. In this case, it\u2019s made of the phosphoproteins that slowly release amino acids into your body. \u201cCasein protein is also a complete protein, but it takes longer to digest, so it\u2019s better for long-term muscle repair and recovery, maybe over the span of a night,\u201d says Vigliotta.\nBest for:\n- Long-term muscle repair\n- Boosting your metabolism and supporting weight loss\n- Those struggling to meet daily protein goals\nSkip if:\n- You\u2019re allergic to milk\n- You follow a vegan diet\n- You\u2019re looking for a fast-acting formula\nCollagen Protein Powder\nCollagen protein powder is derived from animal sources, including bone, tendon and skin. The final product, known as hydrolyzed collagen, offers a variety of benefits for your joints, skin and hair. However, it\u2019s not as effective as whey protein for promoting muscle growth.\nBest for:\n- Promoting healthy joints and bones\n- Strengthening hair and nails\n- Maintaining skin elasticity\nSkip if:\n- You follow a vegan or vegetarian diet\nPlant-Based Protein Powder\nCommon sources for plant-based protein powder include peas, soy, brown rice and hemp\u2014and many blends include a mix of different foods. \u201cPlant-based protein isn\u2019t always a \u2018complete\u2019 protein, so you may need to blend it with other foods or forms of protein to make it more complete,\u201d says Vigliotta. \"It's easy to digest and ultimately a good choice if you're a vegan or vegetarian.\"\nBest for:\n- Vegans and vegetarians\n- Boosting your protein intake\n- Those with milk sensitivities\nSkip if:\n- You want a complete protein powder\nFinal Thoughts\nNo matter which type of supplement you buy, Vigliotta says it\u2019s often worth spending a bit more money on a high-quality blend. \u201cI prefer to think of what I put in my body as an investment in my personal health\u2014it\u2019s a \u2018you get what you pay for\u2019 purchase.\u201d While protein powders are generally safe for healthy individuals, it\u2019s a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider or dietitian before adding this kind of supplement to your diet.\nWhy Trust Forbes Vetted\nThe Forbes Vetted team is dedicated to providing the best recommendations on fitness topics and wellness products.\n- This guide was written by updates writer Claire Epting, who has five years\u2019 experience researching and reporting on lifestyle topics. Her coverage for Forbes Vetted includes activewear roundups on the best leggings for women and the best tennis dresses.\n- For this article, Epting spoke with Forbes Vetted gear editor Cam Vigliotta to gain insight into what to consider when selecting a protein powder. In addition to holding a degree in kinesiology from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, Vigliotta is an active hiker, runner and cyclist who has experience using protein powders firsthand.\n- The Forbes Vetted gear team is experienced in reporting on this particular topic. Our popular guide to the best protein powders is based on firsthand experience with different blends, rigorous research and expert interviews.\n- We will continue to review this guide regularly and update it with any additional relevant information as necessary."

      "text": "As a certified personal trainer, one tool I strongly recommend to stay on top of your health goals is a fitness tracker. This Spy Kids-esque wearable keeps tabs on just about every aspect of your health, such as sleep, recovery, blood oxygen levels, and respiratory and heart rates. To find the best fitness trackers and watches for different types of activities, I used my expertise as a trainer and weightlifter to give 14 top-rated models a spin. After eight months of testing, there are seven I recommend. The Garmin Venu 3 won me over as the best fitness tracker overall for its versatility and accuracy, but if you\u2019re a beginner, I suggest the Fitbit Charge 6, which impressed me with its level of precision despite the no-frills, user-friendly design.\nHere is my list of all seven winners after rigorous testing:\nWhile most smartwatches include health tracking among a slew of smart features, fitness trackers are built for activity, offering specialized features, accurate metrics and durable, comfortable wearability for strenuous sweat sessions. To determine the best fitness trackers and watches overall, I incorporated 14 top models into my weight-training, cardio, walking and sleep routines for eight months. I evaluated each test unit for ease of use, comfort, battery life, customization and tracking options, and heart rate accuracy, using a chest strap as my control. Since these tracking devices are highly personal, I made sure my final list includes recommendations that span a variety of activities, training goals and user preferences. Read more about my test findings below. (And for more on how to make the most of these wearables, see my guide on how to use a fitness tracker.)\nLike Garmin\u2019s Venu 2, the Venu 3 is geared toward average gym-goers. But this version also includes upgraded features like sleep coaching, post-workout recovery insights and a more advanced heart rate sensor.\nAccurate And Easy To Use Mid-Workout\nOut of all of the trackers I tested, the Venu 3 was the most accurate while still being easy to use. Its large 1.4-inch touchscreen and bright display made it easy to check my stats mid-workout and cycle through different health features (of which there are many).\nAesthetically, the Venu 3\u2019s size makes it less discreet than other options. There\u2019s no mistaking it for a watch, but the silicone band and stainless steel bezel made it one of the more attractive fitness trackers I tried. And although it was bulkier, it felt surprisingly lightweight compared with trackers of a similar size.\nHelpful Features Make Venu 3 Feel Like A Personal Coach\nThe Garmin Venu has become something of a personal coach to me after training with it for four months. I found the recovery time predictions useful for planning my daily movement after working out, including how many walks to take and when to go to bed. I was also able to create my workouts within the Garmin Connect app and load them onto the watch, down to the sets, reps and exact exercises. Most importantly, I\u2019ve seen improved results in the gym, like PRs (personal records) during lifting and greater endurance after following the watch\u2019s post-workout recovery advice and sleep tips.\nOutstanding Battery Life, But Interface Could Be More Intuitive\nThe battery life also blows away any other tracker I\u2019ve used. After noticing mid-workout that my watch was down to less than 5% in battery, the power-saving mode helped it hold on for not only the rest of my workout but three more hours after that. Other notable features include more than 30 preloaded sports apps and workouts, as well as personalized sleep coaching.\nI do wish the interface was a bit more intuitive. Navigating to features on the watch like the post-workout summary can be a bit confusing, even after using the watch consistently. But overall, I found the Garmin Venu 3 to be an advanced watch that takes a holistic approach to fitness without being intimidating to use\u2014so much so that I ended up consistently gravitating toward the Venu 3 even on my off days from training.\nThe 2025 Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards are here: Explore our 150 top-recommended items across categories after extensive research and testing.\nFor beginners just starting out with a regular exercise program, I recommend the Fitbit Charge 6, the brand\u2019s latest iteration in its Charge series. Of the trackers I tested, it was the simplest to use while offering a surprising level of versatility and accuracy, given its basic design.\nDoes It All\u2014Including Precise Heart Rate Monitoring\nThe Charge 6 can do just about anything most trackers can do: count steps and distance, track sleep (including sleep stages), recognize when you\u2019re engaging in one of nearly 40 different workouts, and monitor key health indicators like irregular heart rhythms, stress, moods and menstrual cycles.\nThe Charge 6 also features a more advanced heart rate monitor than its predecessors, which paid off in its level of accuracy during my testing. It kept up with my heart rate during high-intensity workouts, which is typically where I find most trackers fail in their ability to measure my varying heart rate accurately. I went from 160 beats per minute during the middle of a set to around 120 BPM during rest\u2014all within a 30-second to one-minute window\u2014and the Charge 6\u2019s tracking was right in line with my control device through it all (the Polar H10 Chest Strap).\nIts Insights Were Easy To Follow\nUnlike other trackers that can make it hard to break down what all of the numbers mean, the Charge 6\u2019s insights were straightforward. It communicated updates to me via weekly progress reports and daily scores for sleep and stress management\u2014all of which broke down my stats using cute graphics, bright colors and easy-to-follow insights.\nAccuracy Can Be Inconsistent But Didn\u2019t Skew Overall Data\nAfter using this tracker for four months, I still enjoy the Fitbit\u2019s simple interface and uncomplicated design. I\u2019ve found, however, that the accuracy of the heart rate tracking can be inconsistent. During a few lifting sessions, the heart rate tracking got a slow start and was off for a few sets compared with my control device before catching up by the middle or end of my workout. This was somewhat annoying, although it didn\u2019t seem to skew my overall post-workout summary data, which was usually still in line with my control for metrics like estimated calories burned and average heart rate.\nYou don\u2019t need to spend more than $100 on a fitness tracker that gets the job done. If you\u2019re not ready to invest or you\u2019re on a budget, I recommend the Amazfit Bip 3 Pro.\nPerforms Better Than Its Unassuming Looks\nWhile it\u2019s not the best-looking or most feature-rich tracker, the Amazfit was accurate across heart rate, activity and sleep tracking. For sleep specifically, it proved to be precise with metrics like time spent in bed and minutes spent awake.\nWhen I first unboxed it, the square screen and thick silicone band immediately reminded me of the Fitbit Versa, and based on its comparable tracking options, I can confirm it\u2019s a pretty solid dupe. For reference, the newest model of the Fitness Versa, the Versa 4, retails for around $189.\nUser-Friendly, But Some Post-Workout Data Lacks Detail\nThe Bip 3 Pro\u2019s interface is intuitive and didn\u2019t require so much as a glance through the user manual. I also liked that I had an abundance of activity tracking options to choose from. However, the post-workout insights offered varied levels of detail. For weight training, they\u2019re limited to heart rate information. Cardio-based activities like a treadmill run come with more detailed data. Despite the somewhat meager training insights, I still found it to be a user-friendly tracker that offers value for the price.\nFor Apple users looking for a more advanced smartwatch that can track your workouts, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a better option than the Apple Watch Series 9, which is equipped with more features than the Apple Watch SE and is more affordable than the Apple Watch Ultra.\nStellar Heart Rate Tracking And Movement Detection\nThe Apple Watch Series 9 also came in a close second to the Garmin Venu 3 for my favorite tracker for training. This is in large part because the Series 9 accurately tracked my heart rate variability, including how long I spent in certain zones, my walking heart rate and how long it took my body to return to normal post-exercise.\nThe Series 9\u2019s ability to detect movement automatically was another big highlight. I appreciated how quickly it could sense the type of exercise I was doing, so I never had to manually record activities like outdoor walks or yoga. It even detected which stroke I was swimming when I tested it in the pool. As for its design, the Series 9 (like other Apple wearables) is a sleek watch that\u2019s aesthetically much more advanced than a traditional fitness tracker.\nUltra-Convenient Health Monitoring For Apple Users\nAfter consistently using the Apple Watch and comparing it with others I\u2019ve tested and tried, the Series 9\u2019s seamless integration with my iPhone makes it one of the most convenient to use among the ones I tested. Having all of my health information in one place on my iPhone\u2019s Health app makes it easy to keep close tabs on my overall health and to monitor progress over a longer period of time.\nLacks Some Features Of A Dedicated Fitness Tracker\nHowever, the Series 9 is a smartwatch at its core; it can\u2019t compete with Garmin\u2019s workout analytics, training feedback or superior integration with the Garmin Connect app. While having all my workout stats readily available in my iPhone is convenient, the Health app doesn\u2019t summarize your information like the Connect app does, nor does it offer recommendations for recovery. The Series 9\u2019s relatively short battery life also proved to be a real pain point: Because I have to charge the watch almost as frequently as I do my phone, it discouraged me from using the Apple Watch over the other trackers.\nA New Version To Consider: Apple Watch Series 10\nThe Apple Watch Series 10, our tech editor\u2019s top pick in our best smartwatches list and the latest model in this series, might be a better pick for you if you don\u2019t already have the Series 9. It retails at a comparable $399 and features a thinner build, redesigned speakers and\u2014most importantly\u2014a new sleep apnea detection feature (in addition to everything else the Series 9 already does). Read more about these improvements in our tester\u2019s full review of the Series 10.\nThe most feature-rich tracker I tested, the Garmin Forerunner 265 is an ideal option for runners, outdoor enthusiasts and anyone with specific training goals. Like its name suggests, it\u2019s heavy on the running-centric features, like built-in workouts, distance-specific pacing strategies and real-time performance readings.\nUseful Functions, Even For Non-Runners\nWhile I\u2019m not much of a runner myself, I still found some of these functions useful. The training readiness score recommends workout intensity based on the quantity and quality of your sleep, stress levels and heart rate variability. After a poor night of rest, for instance, my training readiness score wasn\u2019t nearly as high as after I\u2019d had a good night\u2019s sleep, which told me it probably wasn\u2019t the best day for an intense session.\nRunning Power Feature Optimizes Workouts\nI also let my fianc\u00e9\u2014who often goes on long-distance runs and rucks\u2014give it a spin. He loved the Running Power feature, which predicted how much force he applied to his run and how to maximize his workouts based on factors like the intensity of the wind (anyone who\u2019s experienced springtime in Colorado knows the wind is no joke).\nA Durable Design Made For Outdoor Athletes\nDesign-wise, the Garmin Forerunner 265 has a rugged look and a sturdy, durable feel. For endurance athletes and outdoor enthusiasts looking for a robust option, the Forerunner 265 is a clear winner. (Read our tester\u2019s detailed review of the Garmin Forerunner 265 for more insights.)\nIt\u2019s true that most wearables can keep close tabs on your menstrual cycle. But if you want to track your ovulation, peak fertility days and pregnancy specifically, the Garmin Lily 2 is your best option. It was the smallest tracker I tested, but it held its own against some of the more advanced watches on the docket.\nOffers Similar Insights As Our Best Overall Pick\nSimilar to the Venu 3, this tracker measures energy expenditure by updating your body battery with recommended rest times and activity levels, and it also highlights which muscles you worked during physical activity. After a strength-training session, the Lily\u2019s post-workout app summary listed the types of exercises I performed, from barbell squats to sumo-stance deadlifts.\nPatterned Lens And Other Stylish Details\nNamed the most stylish in Forbes Vetted\u2019s guide to the best smartwatches for women, the tracker also features thoughtful design touches that I appreciated, like a patterned lens, a hidden display option and the choice between a leather or nylon strap to make it feel less like fitness watch and more like a fashion accessory. And despite the superlative category named here, this watch isn\u2019t just for women: Anyone looking for a smaller, stylish wearable or one with fertility tracking features will fare best with the Lily 2. (Check out our gear editors\u2019 other favorite Garmin watches for women for more options.)\nTesting the Samsung Galaxy Watch6 may have been one of the only times I\u2019ve second-guessed my choice in a smartphone. Sitting squarely at the intersection of fitness tracker and smartwatch, it offers smartphone capabilities for Android users (similar to Apple for iPhone users), but with slightly more advanced health tracking. It\u2019s also lightweight, comfortable and easy to adjust, and it almost wears like a second skin.\nSet Personalized Heart Rate Zones\nI liked how I could set personalized heart rate zones and get notified once I hit those targets. Although this feature is probably more beneficial to runners than other types of athletes, I enjoyed using it for strength training, particularly for workouts when my intensity is sometimes lacking.\nLacks Where True Fitness Watches Don\u2019t\nCompared with true fitness watches like Garmin\u2019s, however, the Galaxy Watch6 has a couple of limitations. While I liked the Galaxy\u2019s personalized heart rate tracking, it doesn\u2019t track heart rate variability (the time between each heartbeat), unlike the Garmin Venu 3, the Lily 2 and the Forerunner 265. The Venu 3 and the Forerunner 265 also edged out the Galaxy Watch6 when it came to GPS tracking and in-depth, post-workout insights. Plus, its battery life was slightly disappointing, though likely a byproduct of its hybrid design.\nOverall, A Win For Android Users\nAll things considered, I found the Galaxy Watch6 to be an excellent option for Android users who want to keep tabs on their workouts and health, but who ultimately prefer a smartwatch design (and don\u2019t mind the tracking limitations that come with it) over a true fitness tracker. (To find out more about the differences between the Samsung Watch6 and Watch6 Classic, check out our tester\u2019s in-depth review comparing both.)\nA New Version To Consider: Galaxy Watch7\nIf you don\u2019t already own the Samsung Galaxy Watch6, consider opting for the newer Galaxy Watch7 (retailing at $210) instead. Samsung\u2019s upgrades, which it announced at the recent Samsung Unpacked, include a new sleep apnea tracking feature, more accurate location tracking, an Energy Score that recommends daily activities based on combined sleep and activity metrics, and an AI-based Wellness Tips feature that makes overall health suggestions based on all your health tracking data.\nOther Fitness Trackers And Watches I Tested\nI tested a total of 14 top-rated fitness trackers for this story; below are the seven models that didn\u2019t make the cut. I included my rating for each unit (out of 10), based on evaluating each one\u2019s ease of use, accuracy, battery life, fit, design, and variety of health and activity tracking options.\nOther Fitness Trackers We Tested That Are Worth Considering\nWhile the four models below didn\u2019t make my final list of recommendations, they excelled in certain aspects like extra tracking and sleep monitoring that may make them a worthy investment for specific users:\n- Best For Serious Athletes: Apple Watch Ultra 2 (7.5): Serious athletes may benefit from the extra data and tracking capabilities this watch offers, but the average user doesn\u2019t need the majority of these features. The Series 9 is easier to use, less bulky and about $400 less, making it the better choice for most.\n- Best For Apple Users On A Budget: Apple Watch SE (7): The SE is a solid alternative to the Series 9 for Apple users looking to spend a little less. It\u2019s easy to use, accurate and stylish, plus it offers a similar range of strap and watch face options. However, the SE is more of a smartwatch than a fitness tracker, so it doesn\u2019t provide as much data for sleep and health tracking.\n- Best Smart Ring: Oura Ring Gen 3 (7): The Oura is more aesthetically appealing than a traditional wearable, but because it doesn\u2019t have a screen, it took more of an effort to check my stats mid-workout. Plus, the data I reviewed in the app was inaccurate compared with my control device. The Oura\u2019s sleep tracking is exceptional, though, and provides in-depth data on sleep stages and sleep quality. It\u2019s also worth noting that the Oura is a favorite of NASM-certified personal trainer and Row House coach Josh Honore; he likes to recommend it to his clients who don\u2019t like wearing things on their wrist. (Check out our tested guide to the best smart rings if you\u2019re interested in this type of wearable.)\n- Best For Detailed Running Insights: Coros Pace 3 (7): Although the Coros offered incredibly detailed tracking for endurance activities and cardio-based workouts, I found the interface trickier to navigate than the others, and the bulky size made for an awkward fit.\nOther Fitness Trackers We Don\u2019t Recommend\nThe three fitness trackers below didn\u2019t pass muster during my tests, due mainly to inconsistent and inaccurate tracking:\n- Withings ScanWatch Light (6.5): The Withings excelled aesthetically; its polished design is more watch-like than the others I tested. Unfortunately, the heart rate tracking was inconsistent during my workouts, which rendered any post-workout data unreliable.\n- Whoop 4.0 (6): The Whoop\u2019s post-workout insights were inconsistent compared with my control and with the other trackers, and the app interface was a bit overwhelming. The inconvenient minimalist design meant I had to unlock my phone mid-workout to check basic metrics like heart rate and time elapsed. I did appreciate Whoop\u2019s strain score (similar to Garmin\u2019s training readiness score), which monitors energy exerted and offers recovery recommendations. It\u2019s also Honore\u2019s preferred fitness tracker and recommends it for performance-level athletes.\n- Xiaomi Smart Band 8 (5): Tracking was inaccurate and inconsistent across a variety of workouts and activities on this budget tracker.\nHow I Tested The Best Fitness Trackers And Watches\nWhen choosing which fitness trackers to test, I prioritized brands known for accuracy and reliability and considered options for people of all fitness levels. I evaluated ease of use, battery life, a comfortable fit and an appealing design, as well as a variety health and activity tracking options. I also pored over online reviews, leveraged my own experience and tapped my network of gym friends and outdoor enthusiasts for insights. Below is an in-depth look at the specific criteria I used to determine which fitness trackers are a cut above the rest.\nHeart Rate Accuracy\nThis is the most important function of a fitness tracker. Without accurate heart rate readings, nearly every other metric (e.g., calorie burn, estimated expenditure, estimated intensity, recovery recommendations) will be off, thus rendering any activity insights useless. To test each tracker\u2019s accuracy, I used a control device: the Polar H10 Chest Strap, which is regarded as one of the most accurate heart rate monitors on the market since it measures your heart rate directly, rather than through your pulse.\nI put each tracker through a series of workouts consisting of strength training with light cardio and compared the tracker\u2019s heart rate reading to the companion app and to the Polar H10. I examined and compared key heart rate stats like average heart rate, max heart rate, percentage of time spent in certain heart rate zones and estimated calorie burn. Since chest-band heart rate sensors are considered the most accurate type of heart rate tracker, I expected some variation between my control and the fitness trackers. While my list of winners proved to be pretty accurate, the models that came closest to the Polar were the Garmin Venu 3 and Apple Watch Series 9.\nBattery Life\nI tested battery life by charging each tracker to 100%, then wearing it for two full days and two nights. Some\u2014like the Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Series 9 and Samsung Galaxy Watch6\u2014required a charge during that two-day period, while others still had plenty of battery left. At the least, each tracker needed to last the better part of a day (i.e., a full night\u2019s rest and a workout the following day) or to have a fast-charge option available for convenience.\nEase Of Use\nTo measure how easy each tracker was to use, I started by timing how long the initial unboxing and setup took, taking note of any roadblocks. (For example, the Fitbit Charge 6 was quick to set up but required a hard reset before it would sync with my phone.) But the true test was how easy it was for me to learn to use the app and features of each tracker. If I had gotten the hang of things by the time I was wearing it at the gym\u2014and didn\u2019t need to look up how to sift through different activity options and start, stop and pause my workout\u2014I deemed it easy to use.\nHealth Tracking\nTo test each watch\u2019s health tracking, I wore each tracker to sleep, to the gym and during every activity or rest period in between. This gave me a comprehensive view of each tracker\u2019s capabilities and accuracy. When analyzing health tracking, I examined the types of insights each tracker provided about my sleep, cycle and stress levels, and the specificity of each. For example, some trackers provided a more in-depth look at my sleeping habits, including personalized tips on how to get better rest the next night and how my quality of rest affected my ability to recover. I also looked at how each tracker presented these insights (sleep scores, stress scores, etc.) and considered which were helpful for contextualizing the data, rather than giving me an arbitrary number with no real context as to how it affected my overall health.\nActivity Tracking\nFor activity tracking, I looked at how many activity or sport modes were available and how well each watch tracked my movement during those workouts and activities. I looked at the types of metrics recorded for different workouts (strength training, pool swim, outdoor walks, etc.), how well it did this compared to my control, and whether the data provided useful insights for my current and next workout.\nOverall Fit And Design\nTo get a feel for the overall fit of each tracker, I wore them to bed, during workouts and throughout my day to test their comfort. I considered factors like overall size, the material of the band, weight and adjustability. In some instances, like with Garmin\u2019s Venu 3, the bulk didn\u2019t make for a heavy-handed feel, whereas others (like the Coros) definitely felt like their size. I also considered the size and design of the watch: how big or small the face was and whether it had buttons or knobs that made it easy to select different features.\nHow To Pick A Fitness Tracker\nIt can be challenging to sift through all of the different fitness trackers, which range from smartwatches to dedicated fitness devices. Below, I break down key factors to consider to simplify your search. Ultimately, \u201cThe number-one thing to consider is whether you truly believe the tracker is going to enhance your experience in fitness and training,\u201d says NASM-certified personal trainer and Row House coach Josh Honore.\nIntended Use\nSome fitness trackers work better for specific types of activities, whereas others are more of an all-purpose wearable. Do you want a tracker that excels at running? Swimming? Cycling? All of the above? Or do you want one that can keep up with you at the gym and the activities in between? If you have special health concerns or if you\u2019re trying to conceive or are currently pregnant, you\u2019ll want to find a more advanced tracker.\nIn the experience of Laura Rooney, clinical associate professor and practicum coordinator of exercise science at Marquette University, Garmin\u2019s fitness trackers are best suited to outdoor activities like marathons and ultra-marathons, while smartwatches like the Apple Watch and Samsung Galaxy, as well as beginner-friendly trackers like the Fitbit, are great for the average consumer. She says of the latter category, \u201cThe reason we see more benefit for the general consumer is their broad use and the convenience factor.\u201d Regardless of which fitness tracker you choose, Rooney advises using them in conjunction with professional coaching or training. \u201cThere's a reason professionals are always at the top of the list for exercise resources\u2014because we can actually use the training tools and [unpack] what they can do for you,\u201d she says.\nPlatform\nConsider the ecosystem your smartphone or other connected devices are already a part of before investing in a fitness tracker. Some watches, like any of the Apple Watches or the Samsung Galaxy Watch6, can only integrate with other devices that are already part of that same ecosystem.\nPrice\nFitness trackers range in price from as little as $50 to $800 or more, though most options lie somewhere in the $150 to $400 range. Generally speaking, the more features a watch has (including advanced GPS tracking, in-depth training insights and the ability to track race-specific paces), the higher its cost. However, most fitness trackers in the $150 to $300 range offer valuable features for the average person.\nBattery Life\nSome fitness trackers can last up to two weeks on a full charge, while others can\u2019t make it through a full 24 hours. Think about how you plan on using your tracker; if you\u2019re looking to take it along for a backpacking trip or an ultramarathon, you\u2019ll need one with a robust battery. Some watches also come with a fast-charge option, which is a nice compromise for those who don\u2019t necessarily need a two-week battery life but also don\u2019t want to be glued to an outlet.\nDesign\nYou\u2019ll get more use out of a fitness tracker that\u2019s user-friendly, comfortable to wear and nice to look at. Consider your own comfort and style preferences in addition to the overall purpose you want your tracker to serve. Endurance athletes may compromise on size and style if it means getting more advanced GPS tracking, while those looking for a casual option may prioritize aesthetics.\nAlso keep in mind the different types of materials for watch bands. Most come with a few options, like silicone, leather or nylon. In my experience, silicone and nylon are usually the most comfortable and the easiest to adjust.\nLastly, decide whether you want a minimalist design, like that of the Whoop or the Oura. \u201cA lot of my clients don\u2019t like things on their wrist,\u201d says Honore, who works with dancers who don\u2019t want to be distracted by a screen. You may prefer having a screen so that you can glance down during a workout and check your progress.\nWhy Trust Forbes Vetted\nForbes Vetted\u2019s experienced gear team, which has researched, tested and reviewed a wide range of fitness and outdoor apparel and equipment, including training tools like the best GPS watches and running watches.\n- Author and tester Katie Simpson, Forbes Vetted\u2019s senior strategy editor, has been an ACE-certified personal trainer for over two years. Throughout her own training and sessions with clients, she\u2019s used countless fitness trackers, which has helped her learn the most useful features to look for.

      "text": "Slopes, wind, breaks, hazards, club selection\u2014there\u2019s plenty to think about on the golf course. Your shorts shouldn\u2019t be one of them. In fact, the best golf shorts should move with you and look good whether you\u2019re lining up a shot or grabbing a drink at the clubhouse. With so many styles to choose from, I spoke with the founder of a golf apparel brand to find out what really matters when shopping for golf shorts. Based on those insights, I believe the Lululemon Commission Shorts are best for most golfers\u2014they\u2019re stretchy, sweat-wicking, quick-drying and can be dressed up or down.\nTo find the best golf shorts, I considered a handful of key factors beyond general comfort: fit and fabric, for freedom of movement; storage, because having enough pockets without unwanted bulk is essential; weather preparedness, to handle hot, humid rounds or unexpected showers; and style, so you look just as good off the course as you do on it. The picks in this guide suit a range of different preferences and playing conditions. Read on to see six of the best golf shorts of 2025, plus four runners-up we also like.\nLululemon might not be the first brand that comes to mind when you think of golf shorts, but after chatting with a few golfers about their go-to styles, I was surprised to hear almost all of them mention the Canadian label. A little more digging confirmed that a lot of golfers swear by the Commission Short.\nMade from a stretchy, breathable fabric blend, it has the polished look of dress shorts but acts more like an athletic short. By combining a casual fit with performance fabrics, it moves with you instead of holding you back, so you can drive the ball or focus on a tough putt without your shorts getting in the way. Plus, there are plenty of pockets for tees, gloves and a scorecard, and a hidden zipper pocket keeps your drink-cart cash secure. But the biggest selling point is the sheer comfort and versatility\u2014you can wear these shorts on and off course without feeling underdressed.\nOf course, versatility has its trade-offs. Some shorts like the Adidas Ultimate365 are more breathable, while others like the Bonobos Highland Tour are more refined. But few shorts strike a balance of style and comfort like this pair. And if you keep an eye on Lululemon\u2019s occasional sales, you can snag a pair at a solid discount.\nIf flexibility is your top priority, the PGA Tour Flat Front Shorts are a great choice. They feature strategically woven seams (the brand calls it MotionFlux 360 technology) designed to improve your range of motion by letting you swing freely without bunching. The polyester-spandex blend offers just a hint of stretch, and it\u2019s moisture-wicking to help keep you cool and dry, even on sweltering, humid days. Plus, the lined waistband keeps your shirt neatly tucked in from the first tee to the final putt\u2014no constant adjusting or fiddling required.\nPolyester-heavy fabrics can sometimes feel less breathable than natural blends, and these shorts aren\u2019t quite as soft as some high-end options like the Lululemon Commission Short. But unless you\u2019re playing in extreme heat, the lightweight design and moisture-wicking properties do a solid job of managing sweat.\nI hadn\u2019t heard of CRZ Yoga before talking with experienced golfers, but the brand quickly stood out as a solid alternative if you\u2019re not looking to drop $100 on a pair of shorts. The All-Day Comfy Golf Shorts live up to their name, thanks to a stretchy, quick-drying polyester construction. They may look like classic khakis, but they\u2019re much lighter and more versatile. And because they\u2019re designed specifically for golf, they come with dedicated pockets for your phone, cards and keys, plus a hidden zipper pocket for cash or small valuables. And best of all, they\u2019re less than half the price of similar shorts without sacrificing an ounce comfort or durability.\nWith that said, most synthetic golf shorts use fabric blends to maximize performance, so it\u2019s a little disappointing that this pair is 100% polyester. On its own, polyester tends to trap heat, making it less breathable than cotton or a blended fabric. It also holds onto odor, so you\u2019ll probably wash these shorts more often if you tend to sweat. Still, these are minor drawbacks most golfers won\u2019t notice, especially when you can grab two or three colors (there are over 10 to choose from) for the price of one pair of high-end shorts.\nWhen you need classic-looking golf shorts that fit just right, the Bonobos Highland Tour Golf Shorts are hard to beat. They have that clean, tailored look you\u2019d expect from Bonobos, but come packed with thoughtful features to keep you comfortable on the course. A gel-lined waistband, for example, creates a secure fit without feeling too tight, while lightweight, water-repellent fabric helps keep you dry through unexpected drizzles. Plus, with built-in UPF-rated sun protection, you\u2019ll get an extra layer of defense against long rounds in the sun.\nAs for storage, you get a dedicated scorecard pocket and a zippered back pocket to keep small essentials secure. While the zipper on the rear pocket might not be a great feature if you prefer to store your gloves or scorecard on that side (it could cause unwanted wear and tear over time), it\u2019s a small and unlikely price to pay. Because you\u2019ve got nearly 10 colors, three fits, 14 waist sizes and two inseam lengths to choose from, you\u2019re pretty much guaranteed to find a pair that fits right and feels good\u2014something you can\u2019t always say about formal apparel.\nThose of us with skinny legs (myself included) struggle to find shorts that fit well around the waist and thighs, but the Mizzen + Main Helmsman Shorts are designed with a slimmer, modern fit that complements leaner builds without feeling restrictive. The four-way stretch fabric makes it easy to move through every swing, while mesh-lined pockets add breathability and help keep bulk to a minimum. A zippered back pocket provides a secure spot for smaller items, and the lightweight, quick-drying fabric blend makes them comfortable for hours on end.\nObviously, the slimmer fit isn\u2019t ideal for golfers with bigger thighs, so don\u2019t reach for these if you find comfort in regular-fit shorts. And if you have skinny legs but still prefer a relaxed fit, you may want to size up or look at roomier options like the CRZ Yoga All-Day Comfy Golf Shorts. But for those who appreciate a clean, slim look with plenty of performance-driven features, the Helmsman Shorts deliver without sacrificing comfort or flexibility.\nThe Adidas Ultimate365 Golf Shorts prove that a quality pair of well-fitting shorts doesn\u2019t have to constrict your legs like a python. Designed for athletic builds, this style offers a tailored-yet-stretchy fit that accommodates bigger thighs without feeling too tight or restrictive. The soft, breathable fabric moves well, and a water-repellent coating helps wick away moisture, whether you\u2019re playing in humid conditions or caught in the rain. For taller golfers, the 10-inch inseam option provides a little extra coverage, and with over a dozen colors to choose from, there\u2019s a shade for most kits.\nThe only potential downside is that the fabric, while stretchy, is more structured than some ultra-lightweight options. In other words, these shorts are a bit stiffer and designed to hold their shape. But for golfers who want a versatile style that balances performance and comfort through the crotch and thighs, the Ultimate365 Shorts are a reliable option.\nG/Fore Maverick Shorts ($125): G/Fore\u2019s four-way stretch Maverick shorts are made from a blend of polyester and spandex to help you swing with confidence. They contain mesh pockets for your on-course essentials, and a built-in liner that boosts comfort. At $125, they\u2019re the priciest pair in this guide, but G/Fore knows a thing or two about comfortable golf clothing\u2014you get what you pay for.\nNike Tour Chino Golf Shorts ($80): Nike\u2019s formal take on golf pants features a water-repellent finish to keep drizzle at bay and mesh-lined pockets for your ball, tees and scorecard. The relaxed cut is easy to wear for hours, and it transitions nicely from the course to the clubhouse.\nRhone Commuter Shorts ($98): Rhone Commuter Shorts aren\u2019t technically golf shorts, but they offer plenty of stretch and a few well-placed pockets to meet the needs of most golfers. In fact, they look and feel a lot like our top pick, the Lululemon Commission Shorts. If the 7-inch inseam leaves you feeling a bit too exposed, check out the 9-inch Commuter Shorts instead.\nUnder Armour Drive Chill Vented ($80): As the name implies, Under Armour\u2019s Drive Chill Vented shorts manage sweat to maintain comfort. The combination of Iso-Chill and ArmourVent fabrics feels breathable and cool, so even a hot round in the Florida sun won\u2019t interrupt your game. The style is finished with four pockets and a fluorine-free water repellent treatment.\nWhy Trust Forbes Vetted\nThe Forbes Vetted gear team writes dozens of equipment and apparel guides each year, covering everything from running shoes to massage guns to winter base layers. We also cover a range of golf equipment and apparel, including rangefinders, shoes and shorts.\nAuthor of this guide and Forbes Vetted gear editor Cam Vigliotta has reviewed outdoor gear and apparel for over six years. While he isn\u2019t an avid golfer, he spends a lot of time evaluating performance fabrics and how they fit on your body, which applies to golf and athletic shorts. He also spends time at the range every now and then to unwind after a long day of work.\nTo provide accurate buying advice, we spoke with Scott Morrison, co-founder of Radmor, the first golf apparel brand to eliminate the use of virgin polyester in its clothing. His insights on fit, fabric and functionality helped us identify what makes a pair of golf shorts truly great.\nBeyond expert opinions, we looked into real-world feedback by cross-referencing our picks with online reviews from golfers who have actually bought and played in these shorts. We also spoke with golfers on the Forbes Vetted team to learn more about their favorite styles. All of these insights helped us confirm which pairs truly perform on the course, and which aren\u2019t worth the investment.\nHow We Chose The Best Golf Shorts\nComfortable, well-fitting golf shorts can influence how you look, feel and play. We focused on key details like fit, storage, weather readiness and performance to make sure our picks are both functional and good-looking.\nWe looked for shorts with just the right amount of stretch and breathability\u2014styles that move with you through every swing but still look good, even if you\u2019re struggling to hit a solid shot. A good pair of golf shorts should feel light and comfortable, without being too tight, baggy or stiff.\nPockets might not seem like a big deal until you realize you don\u2019t have a spot for your tees, ball, scorecard or glove. We prioritized shorts with well-placed pockets that don\u2019t add bulk or get in the way while you play.\nBecause golf is played in all kinds of weather, we made sure to include options with moisture-wicking, quick-drying and sun-protective fabrics to help you stay cool and comfortable during long rounds.\nWhile performance is key, we also looked for shorts that transition well off the course. The best options have a clean, classic style that works whether you\u2019re grabbing a post-round drink or heading out for work before hitting the range on your way home.\nHow To Shop For Golf Shorts\nFinding the right golf shorts comes down to more than looking like Rickie Fowler in his orange Sunday attire. Here\u2019s what to consider before making your pick:\nFit And Fabric\nA great pair of golf shorts balance comfort, flexibility and style. Look for materials with a bit of stretch, like blends that contain polyester, spandex and/or elastane, so your shorts move with you as you play.\nA tailored (but not-too-tight) fit helps your shorts look good while allowing for full range of motion. As Scott Morrison points out, \u201cThe best golf shorts combine technical performance with a natural feel.\u201d\nLength is another factor to consider. Most golf shorts fall just above the knee, but brands usually offer slightly shorter or longer inseams, depending on personal preference. Keep in mind that additional coverage also keeps your thighs out of the sun.\nFit is personal, but Morrison notes that for golf, \u201cIt has to be functional.\u201d Slim-fit styles offer a more tailored look, but stretch and flexibility is key to maximizing movement. Regular fits are the best all-around choice, while relaxed fits improve airflow and comfort.\nStorage\nPockets probably sound like an afterthought, but storage can make a big difference\u2014it keeps essentials like tees, ball markers and your scorecard within reach, without adding bulk or feeling awkward. Morrison notes that \u201cPocket design matters. Angled side pockets make access easy, while zippered back pockets add security.\u201d\nSome brands like Radmor even add unique storage features, like a dedicated golf ball pocket in the side seam. Look for deep front pockets and zippered closures to keep small items secure while you move.\nWeather Preparedness\nIf you prefer to play in warm, sunny weather, it\u2019s important to choose shorts made from breathable, moisture-wicking fabrics that keep you cool and dry. Polyester blends are common because they wick sweat and dry quickly, though Morrison points out that, while synthetics dominate because they manage moisture, \u201cCotton blends feel more natural and maintain better temperature regulation.\u201d Some fabrics also feature UPF protection to shield you from UV rays. For those who play in humid or rainy conditions, water-resistant finishes can help keep moisture at bay.\nPerformance technology in golf apparel continues to evolve. Morrison adds that \u201ctemperature-regulating textiles, UV-blocking fabrics and water-repellent coatings\u201d are finding their way into apparel as part of an effort to improve comfort in different conditions.\nStyle\nGolf shorts should be functional on the course but versatile enough to wear beyond it. Many options feature clean, classic designs that transition into casual settings. Morrison explains that the best golf shorts are versatile and designed to look just as good at lunch or a casual dinner as they do on the course. The key to style lies in fabric selection, simple colors and a tailored fit that complements your body and doesn\u2019t feel restrictive (because if you feel uncomfortable, you\u2019ll probably look uncomfortable).\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhile some golfers prefer to wear shorts from major golf brands like Callaway and G/Fore, you\u2019ll also see them wearing Lululemon, Adidas and Under Armour. Generally, golfers wear performance shorts made from breathable, stretchy fabrics that are great for comfort and mobility. Styles often range from the classic, tailored look to more modern slim fits.\nThe PGA Tour dress code explicitly prohibits men from wearing shorts, unless allowed by the hosting Section, or the club hosting the event. With that said, \u201cIn Sections which allow male participants to wear shorts, males may wear slacks or golf shorts which are professional looking in appearance.\u201d Sadly, denim is strictly prohibited, which all but rules out golf jorts.\nNo, 7-inch golf shorts aren\u2019t too short for golf. Inseam length is a personal preference, which is why many best-selling golf shorts come in different lengths to meet the needs of different golfers. Longer lengths (like 9-inch inseams) are more traditional and widely accepted at most courses, but they can restrict movement and feel heavier in hot weather. Shorter lengths (around 5 inches) are more breathable, though they may not meet all dress codes and provide less coverage from the sun. A 7-inch inseam strikes a great balance that\u2019s perfect for most golfers."
