  "title": "Taylor Swift announces new album, \u2018The Life of a Showgirl\u2019",
  "description": "Taylor Swift announced Tuesday she\u2019s dropping a new album: \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl.\u201d",
  "content": "The surprise announcement of the Grammy-winner\u2019s 12th original studio album came in dramatic fashion, as a countdown clock on her website ticked down to 12:12 a.m. Eastern.\n\nIn a video posted on Instagram, giving a sneak peek of Swift\u2019s upcoming appearance on Travis Kelce\u2019s \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast, co-hosted with his brother Jason Kelce, Swift pulled out a mint green briefcase with her initials \u201cTS\u201d written in orange, saying: \u201cThis is my brand new album.\u201d\n\nShe did not say when the album would be released or any other information about it. Fans will have to wait a little longer to see and hear more when her much-awaited podcast appearance on \u201cNew Heights\u201d releases Wednesday at 7 p.m. ET.\n\nNo stranger to including \u201cEaster eggs\u201d or hidden clues in the lead up to her releases, Swift set off a frenzy of speculation Monday after a carousel of 12 photos was posted on her Instagram. \u201cThinking about when she said \u2018See you next era\u2026,\u2019\u201d the caption said.\n\nThe surprise announcement coincided with a reveal Monday night that Swift would join Travis Kelce, her boyfriend and Kansas City Chiefs football player, and his brother for an episode of \u201cNew Heights\u201d after teasing that a \u201cVERY special\u201d guest was joining Wednesday\u2019s episode.\n\nThis is Swift\u2019s first new album since concluding her record-breaking Eras Tour in December. It\u2019s available for pre-order on Swift\u2019s official website in physical vinyl, cassette and CD format.\n\nThe most recent studio album Swift released was \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d a 31-song double album that she announced in 2024 amid the Eras Tour and revamped her set list midway through to add songs from.\n\n\u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d will be her first release since becoming the proud owner of her entire catalog of music, roughly six years after she protested the sale of her master recordings by her former record label.\n\nShe purchased her music \u201coutright with no strings attached, no partnership, full autonomy,\u201d from Shamrock Capital, a private equity company that had acquired her master recordings, she announced in May.\n\n\u201cTo say this is my greatest dream come true is actually being pretty reserved about it,\u201d Swift wrote, adding that she was able to \u201cbuy back\u201d her music from Shamrock following the success of the Eras Tour.\n\nThe sale of the master recordings of Swift\u2019s first six albums to producer Scooter Braun\u2019s Ithaca Holdings in 2019 was contentious, with Swift alleging she was blindsided and not given the opportunity to buy her catalog at the time. Braun maintained her team was aware of a pending deal in advance.\n\nIt prompted the singer to take back ownership of her music in her own way by pledging to re-record the albums. She went on to release what she called \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d albums for \u201cRed,\u201d \u201cSpeak Now,\u201d \u201cFearless\u201d and \u201c1989.\u201d With each \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d album, she\u2019s included a number of previously unreleased songs she coined \u201cfrom the vault.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",

      "text": "It had been nearly nine months since November 15 \u2013 the day I managed to secure three face-value tickets amid Ticketmaster\u2019s infamous meltdown to Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cEras\u201d tour concert in Los Angeles \u2013 when I finally got to see the show this week.\nThe concert, which was the singer\u2019s penultimate show on the first US leg of her tour, was the most impressive three hours and fifteen minutes of live music I\u2019ve ever seen, purely based on her epic delivery of a fully loaded 44-song setlist. And it happened in an atmosphere that celebrated positivity, respect for others and an openness to connect with new friends.\nIt must be said that I fully knew what to expect at this concert. I have been writing about the \u201cEras\u201d tour pretty regularly as both an outlet for my Swiftie-ness and just to bide my time until my show, so avoiding concert spoilers was impossible.\nBut it didn\u2019t matter. Watching clips of the \u201cEras\u201d tour opening sequence on social media \u2013 as I\u2019d repeatedly done for months \u2013 could never compare to the feeling of being in the audience when the two-minute countdown clock started ticking as the crowd roared in anticipation for our \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d to appear.\nI\u2019d been planning logistics for my \u201cEras\u201d show for months, as it became an \u201cAlli\u2019s Version\u201d bachelorette party of sorts, which two of my best girlfriends and soon-to-be bridesmaids attended with me.\nClad in my \u201cReputation\u201d era look, and flanked by my friends in their \u201cLover\u201d and \u201cMidnights\u201d era outfits, we were on our way to the venue about four hours before Swift was set to go on to allow for ample time to get merch and catch her openers, Gracie Abrams and Haim.\nThe scene outside of SoFi Stadium was vibrant and palpable. Moms and daughters in matching costumes were seen posing for photos and we weaved through groups of sparkly concertgoers representing every era of Swift\u2019s musical oeuvre until we finally found our entrance.\nIt was in line for merch when our group was first approached by another fellow Swiftie to trade friendship bracelets, and the moment is a core memory that will stick with me. My friend, who so selflessly volunteered to stay in line during the start of the show, later managed to nab one of those concert-exclusive viral blue crew necks.\nAt our seats, in the 200\u2019s section in the center, we rejoiced about our perfect view, and when that two-minute countdown clock began, cheers from the audience rang through my head crescendoing louder and louder with each passing second until the lights went down and Swift finally appeared on stage.\nStanding in that stadium alongside over 70,000 Swifties collectively scream-singing the bridge to \u201cCruel Summer\u201d with Swift on stage wearing her iconic bejeweled \u201cLover\u201d corset was truly something to behold.\nThe entire show is a complete spectacle. Total stimulation. Flashing lights highlighting her massive stage, elaborate sets and flashy costumes complementing her perfect vocals as she sang all of her greatest hits from the past 17 years, era by era.\nThe epic journey took us through the \u201cFearless\u201d and \u201cRed\u201d eras, with bangers like \u201cLove Story (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d and \u201cI Knew You Were Trouble (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d bringing forth a nostalgic vibe and audience members audibly singing every single lyric.\nThe energy of the \u201cReputation\u201d era set \u2013 my personal favorite, with songs such as \u201cAre You Ready For It,\u201d \u201cDelicate,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Blame Me\u201d and \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d \u2013 was electric as Swift snaked around her stage belting her iconic tracks.\nHer uber-appreciative crowd gave a minutes-long standing ovation following \u201cChampagne Problems\u201d in the \u201cEvermore\u201d era, one of the longest standing-O\u2019s she\u2019s received to date. The cheering was so loud that even ear plugs wouldn\u2019t have masked the shrill.\nOther points in the show, particularly the \u201cFolklore\u201d era, felt super personal both as a listener and as what felt like a bystander bearing witness to Swift\u2019s deepest emotions, something she\u2019s talked about so many times before with respect to her own connection to that 2020 album.\nSwift released no less than four new albums, including \u201cFolklore,\u201d since she last toured in 2018. Finally seeing her perform these songs in concert after connecting with that album so deeply during the darkest days of the pandemic was almost too much. The feeling really materialized during \u201cMy Tears Ricochet,\u201d arguably one of her saddest songs, and to me, one of her most beautiful. This is precisely when I let out a sob, and my friends laughed at me \u2013 all in good fun, of course.\nOf course we speculated for months about which surprise songs we\u2019d get, and when she sang \u201cKing of My Heart\u201d from her 2017 \u201cReputation\u201d album as her second surprise song, the crowd went insane, myself included. \u201cI Know Places\u201d from her megahit 2014 album \u201c1989\u201d was the first surprise song.\nAt the end of the night, we were in complete awe. I could barely walk by that point, yet Swift was perfectly executing her choreography while hitting those high notes in \u201cKarma\u201d at the end of her three-hour set. During her fifth show in six days. A masterclass in stamina.\nSad that it was over, but grateful for the experience, we left the venue feeling very much a part of a community of (mostly) women who valued respect, friendship and empowerment of one another. \u201cEras\u201d was more than a concert \u2013 it was a bedazzling display of femininity for all ages, and a celebration of individuality with one common denominator: the joy of music.\nOn our way to find my wonderful fianc\u00e9 whom we had enlisted as our driver for the night, we walked out of the stadium seeing the faces of elated Swifties with what appeared to be permanent smiles on their faces. Mine is still there."

      "text": "Justin Bieber is defending his manager Scooter Braun after Taylor Swift accused the music executive of bullying her and called the sale of her music catalog to Braun\u2019s company her \u201cworst case scenario.\u201d\n\u201cHey Taylor. First of all i would like to apologize for posting that hurtful instagram post, at the time i thought it was funny but looking back it was distasteful and insensitive.. I have to be honest though it was my caption and post that I screenshoted of scooter and Kanye that said \u201ctaylor swift what up\u201d he didnt have anything to do with it and it wasnt even a part of the conversation in all actuality he was the person who told me not to joke like that.. Scooter has had your back since the days you graciously let me open up for you,\u201d Bieber wrote.\nHe continued: \u201cAs the years have passed we haven\u2019t crossed paths and gotten to communicate our differences, hurts or frustrations. So for you to take it to social media and get people to hate on scooter isn\u2019t fair. What were you trying to accomplish by posting that blog? seems to me like it was to get sympathy u also knew that in posting that your fans would go and bully scooter. Anyway, One thing i know is both scooter and i love you. I feel like the only way to resolve conflict is through communication. So banter back and fourth online i dont believe solves anything. I\u2019m sure Scooter and i would love to talk to you and resolve any conflict, pain or or any feelings that need to be addressed. Neither scooter or i have anything negative to say about you we truly want the best for you. I usually don\u2019t rebuttal things like this but when you try and deface someone i loves character that\u2019s crossing a line.\u201d\nBraun\u2019s wife, Yael Cohen, also came to his defense, writing on Instagram that she won\u2019t allow her husband to be attacked.\nCohen, who founded and serves as the CEO of the health organization F\u2014 Cancer, wrote: \u201cI have never been one for a public airing of laundry, but when you attack my husband\u2026 here we go.\u201d\nShe continued: \u201cMy husband is anything but a bully, he\u2019s spent his life standing up for people and causes he believes in. Beyond that, it\u2019s easy to see that the point of putting this out was to get to bully him. You are supposed to be a role model, but continue to model bullying.\u201d\nBraun had no comment on Swift or his wife\u2019s comments.\nCNN has contacted Swift\u2019s representatives.\nBraun\u2019s Ithaca Holdings acquired Big Machine Label Group from founder Scott Borchetta as part of a $300 million deal, reports Billboard. Swift had been signed to the label from her 2006 self-titled debut album through 2017\u2019s \u201cReputation,\u201d before moving to Universal Music Group.\nIn response to Swift\u2019s allegations that she only learned of the sale when it became public, Jake Basden, Senior Vice President Communications at Big Machine Label Group, pointed to a post from Borchetta which states that Swift\u2019s dad, Scott Swift, is a shareholder in Big Machine Records and Borchetta first alerted all of the shareholders of the pending deal with Ithaca Holdings on June 25.\n\u201cOut of courtesy, I personally texted Taylor at 9:06 p.m, June 29 to inform her prior to the story breaking on the morning of June 30 so she could hear it directly from me,\u201d Borchetta said, adding, \u201cI truly doubt that she \u2018woke up to the news when everyone else did.\u201d\nOn Sunday, Taylor Swift posted a Tumblr in which she shared she was heartbroken that much of her music is now in Braun\u2019s hands. (Braun also manages Ariana Grande and the Zac Brown band.)\nThe sale prevents Swift from owning the first six albums in her catalog. Swift said she did not feel good about the terms presented to her by Big Machine Label Group and that\u2019s why she made the choice to move to Universal Music.\n\u201cI had to make the excruciating choice to leave behind my past,\u201d Swift wrote about her move to the Universal Music label. \u201cMusic I wrote on my bedroom floor and videos I dreamed up and paid for from the money I earned playing in bars, then clubs, then arenas, then stadiums.\u201d\nShe also praised her new label and plugged her new album.\n\u201cI will always be proud of my past work. But for a healthier option, \u2018Lover\u2019 will be out August 23.\u201d\nAn earlier version of this story incorrectly attributed a quote to Jake Basden that should have been attributed to Scott Borchetta. The story has been corrected to reflect that."

      "text": "Taylor Swift is speaking out about Scooter Braun\u2019s sale of her masters.\nThe singer took to Twitter on Monday to post a lengthy and emotional message about the music executive, who acquired the master recordings of her first six albums from her former label \u2013 Big Machine Label Group in June 2019 \u2013 despite her objections. At the time, Swift called the agreement her \u201cworst case scenario.\u201d\n\u201cAs you know, for the past year I\u2019ve been actively trying to regain ownership of my master recordings. With that goal in mind, my team attempted to enter into negotiations with Scooter Braun,\u201d Swift, who has more than 87 million followers on Twitter, wrote on social media.\n\u201cScooters team wanted me to sign an ironclad NDA stating I would never say another word about Scooter Braun unless it was positive, before we could even look at the financial records of BMLG (which is always the first step in a purchase of this nature.\u201d\nCNN has reached out to Braun\u2019s representatives for comment. Since 2019, the two have gone back and forth on social media, with Braun even publicly pleading with Swift at one point to set aside their differences after he claimed he and his family were receiving anonymous death threats.\nSwift wrote on Monday that she was never even given a chance to buy her masters back.\n\u201cI would have to sign a document that would silence me forever before I could even have a chance to bid on my own work. My legal team said that this is absolutely NOT normal, and they\u2019ve never seen an NDA like this presented unless it was to silence an assault accuser by paying them off. He would never even quote my team a price. These master recordings were not for sale to me.\u201d\nShe said that she was only made aware of Braun selling her masters after she received a letter from a private equity company, Shamrock Holdings, letting her know they had purchased her music, videos and album art.\n\u201cThis was the second time my music had been sold without my knowledge.\u201d Swift continued. \u201cThe letter told me that they wanted to reach out before the sale to let me know, but that Scooter Braun had required that they make no contact with me or my team, or the deal would be off.\u201d\nSwift also posted a photo of a letter she wrote to Shamrock Holdings. CNN has reached out to Shamrock Holdings.\nSwift\u2019s last two albums, \u201cLover\u201d and \u201cfolklore\u201d were released through Universal Music Group. She said in her message that she has also begun re-recording her old music which she called \u201cexciting\u201d and \u201ccreatively fulfilling.\u201d\nShe ended her open letter writing, \u201cI love you guys and I\u2019m just gonna keep cruising, as they say.\u201d"
