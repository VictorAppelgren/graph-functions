  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None Lucid stock looks pricier than the competition.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Lucid Group \u203a\n\nOn paper, Lucid Group (NASDAQ: LCID) looks expensive compared to other electric vehicle (EV) stocks. Shares currently trade at 6.3 times sales. Rivian Automotive, a competitor, trades at just 2.5 times sales.\n\nThink Lucid shares are too expensive? Think again. One well-known investor just made a prediction that could create massive value for Lucid shareholders over the next decade and beyond.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\n\nLucid Group should benefit from this $10 trillion opportunity\n\nEarlier this year, well-known investor Cathie Wood made a bold prediction. The global robotaxi industry, she believes, could eventually be worth up to $10 trillion. \"We think $8 trillion to $10 trillion for the entire autonomous taxi opportunity throughout the world, from almost nothing,\" she told investors in March. \"That's how quickly AI is going to cause these things to happen.\"\n\nLast month's partnership deal with Uber Technologies and Nuro put Lucid in the race for this opportunity. Lucid will supply Uber with 20,000 of its Gravity SUVs to help start up a new robotaxi division, using Nuro to drive the vehicles and Uber to manage the customers. Lucid has long promoted its technology stack over its manufacturing business, arguing that the company should be viewed more as a tech stock than a conventional carmaker. Uber deciding to partner with the company on arguably its most technologically intensive venture yet adds a huge vote of confidence to that vision.\n\n\"The whole industry has tried to move from just hardware and manufacturing -- which requires a lot of scale to get costs down -- to adding more software and services,\" venture capitalist Laurie Yoler told McKinsey & Co., this month. Lucid is proof of this industrywide pivot, and the deal with Uber and Nuro suggests it's getting a jump on some of the competition. Not only can it produce vehicles that robotaxi operators want at scale, but these vehicles are also ready for the software-dominant use cases the future will demand.\n\nYes, Lucid stock is more expensive than peers like Rivian. But its early success in the robotaxi industry strongly supports a premium valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Lucid Group right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Lucid Group, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Lucid Group wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $649,657!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,090,993!*\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,057% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 185% for the S&P 500. Don\u2019t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join Stock Advisor.\n\nRyan Vanzo has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Uber Technologies. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.",

      "text": "Cathie Wood is the founder, chief executive officer, and chief investment officer of Ark Invest, an asset manager that invests in disruptive innovation. Ark has more than $10 billion in assets under management spread across six actively managed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), nine index ETFs, and a private equity fund.\nRead on to learn more about Cathie Wood, her investment style, and the top stocks in Ark ETFs.\nWho is Cathie Wood?\nWho is Cathie Wood?\nWood earned wide respect as a famous investor in 2020 when all six Ark ETFs notched returns greater than 100% -- while the S&P 500 grew a mere 16%. The annihilation of market returns by six separate funds gave credibility to Wood's premise that disruptive innovation is the shortest path to growth.\nUnfortunately, Wood's wild success was short-lived. After peaking in 2021, the Ark funds fell about as quickly as they grew. All six of the actively managed Ark funds are more than 30% below their all-time highs as of the fourth quarter of 2024.\nEducation, career, stats\nCathie Wood's education and early career\nWood grew up in California and attended the University of Southern California (USC), where she earned a bachelor's degree in economics and finance. At USC, she was mentored by economist Arthur Laffer. Laffer is known for creating the Laffer Curve, which shows the non-linear relationship between tax rates and the government's tax revenue. Laffer was also an economic policy adviser to President Ronald Reagan and other politicians.\nWood began her professional career as an assistant economist for asset manager Capital Group. Three years later, she accepted a role as chief economist for Jennison Associates. She stayed at Jennison until the late 1990s, when she made the jump from economics to portfolio management.\nAfter leaving Jennison, Wood co-founded a hedge fund, then went to work for AllianceBernstein as a portfolio manager. Her specialty was -- no surprise here -- risky, small-cap stocks with high growth potential. That space served her well initially, but she was criticized for holding too much risk through the 2008 financial crisis.\nIn 2014, Wood left AllianceBerstein to launch Ark Investments.\nCathie Wood's personal stats\n- Age: Wood was born on Nov. 26, 1955.\n- Source of wealth: Wood is self-made. She began her career as an economist and then worked as a portfolio manager before founding Ark Invest.\n- Marital status: Wood is not currently married. She divorced Robert Remington Wood in 2003. He passed away after a fight with cancer in 2018.\n- Residence: Wood lives in Wilton, Connecticut.\n- Children: Wood has three children.\n- Education: Wood graduated from the all-girls Catholic high school Notre Dame Academy in Los Angeles. She then completed a bachelor's degree at USC, majoring in finance and economics.\nInvestment approach\nCathie Wood's investment approach\nWood's investment approach centers on identifying high-impact innovations. The high-level areas of focus are artificial intelligence, DNA sequencing, robotics, energy storage, and blockchain technology. These are five platforms Wood predicts will be prominent areas of growth and change for the global economy.\nTwo key concepts underpin Wood's strategy. The first is that not all innovation produces the same opportunity. To Wood, investable innovation cuts costs, spans sectors and geographies, and fosters more innovation. The second is that identifying appropriate investments takes both big-picture and granular research.\n1. Investable innovation cuts costs, spans sectors and geographies, and fosters more innovation\nThe cost-cutting component is essential because it encourages quick adoption. New solutions that create large-scale efficiencies often generate their own momentum and demand.\nThe breadth of impact defines the size of the growth opportunity for investors, and innovations that launch follow-on disruptions create longer-lasting growth cycles.\nYou can see these qualities in play with Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), an Ark investment. Palantir develops software that uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to help businesses identify opportunities and risks from complex data sets.\nIn its early history, Palantir helped governments fight terrorism around the world. Today, the company has expanded into more than 50 industries with its high-level promises of reducing costs, shortening product development timelines, and accelerating growth.\n2. Both top-down and bottom-up research are needed to identify the best investment opportunities\nThe Ark team finds specific investment opportunities with two layers of research. First, researchers look at big-picture trends to identify innovation platforms and quantify the affected market size. Then, they dive into granular data to identify companies that will either lead or benefit from disruptions.\nPotential investments are scored individually on factors such as culture, execution, barriers to entry, product leadership, valuation outlook, and risk. Researchers also gather company data from social media and crowdsourcing, as well as traditional sources such as company reports.\nWood's investment timeline is five years. In her view, that duration maximizes investor returns on these disruptive innovators. In fewer than five years, these stocks can be volatile. Beyond five years, the growth potential slows down.\nWhen projecting a stock's potential over the five-year horizon, Wood looks for a minimum average annual return of 15%.\nInvestments Cathie Wood avoids\nDisruptive innovation is a narrow focus, which leaves a lot of stocks off the table for Wood, including popular safe-haven securities. You generally won't find consumer staples, premium dividend payers, and other low-volatility picks in Ark funds. You also won't see value stocks, the bread-and-butter of Warren Buffett's portfolio.\nWood doesn't like meme stocks either, even though Wood herself is a popular subject on Reddit. GameStop (NYSE:GME), AMC (NYSE:AMC), and others may be shaking up the investment community, but they are not innovating to Wood's standards.\nArk funds also do not replicate the S&P 500. Many of these premier U.S. stocks do not meet Ark's growth potential or innovation requirements. There are exceptions, though. Ark has a sizable position in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), along with exposure to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\nBiggest stock investments\nCathie Wood's biggest stock investments\nThe table below shows the five largest positions across Ark ETFs.\n| Company Name | Ticker | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| Tesla | NASDAQ:TSLA | Tesla makes and sells electric vehicles, solar energy generation equipment, and solar energy storage solutions. |\n| Coinbase | NASDAQ:COIN | Coinbase operates a cryptocurrency trading platform. |\n| Roku | NASDAQ:ROKU | Roku runs a streaming entertainment platform and manufactures and sells streaming players. |\n| Block | NYSE:SQ | Block provides payment-acceptance hardware and software to businesses and also operates the consumer-focused Cash App. |\n| Roblox | NYSE:RBLX | Roblox runs a gaming platform that allows users to create and play their own games. |\nRelated investing topics\nMore from Cathie Wood\n- Wood on Twitter\n- Wood on Linkedin\n- Ark Invest on YouTube\n- The Ark Podcast\nCathie Wood: High-risk, high-reward\nWood specializes in picking high-growth stocks. She's proven her skill at beating the market, but it hasn't been a smooth ride. After earning triple-digit returns in 2020, Ark ETFs have struggled.\nThrough the rough patch, Wood is standing by her commitment to disruptive innovation as the best path to growth. The performance of Ark ETFs is a reminder to investors that there's no achieving high growth without some volatility.\nCathie Wood FAQ\nCathie Wood FAQ\nWhat is Cathie Wood's net worth?\nWood's estimated net worth is $140 million, down from its peak of $400 million in 2021.\nIs Cathie Wood self-made?\nWood is self-made. Her parents immigrated to the U.S. from Ireland in search of a better life. She graduated from USC and built a career in asset management before launching Ark Invest in 2014.\nWhat is Cathie Wood's investment strategy?\nWood favors companies that innovate and disrupt. In her view, some of the most disruptive innovations are those that enable cost-cutting. A new technology that allows producers to shave their expenses by 30%, for example, is likely to gain traction quickly. It also may create a new industry and/or foster more innovation. Wood's ideal investments are stocks poised to spark that snowball effect of growth and follow-on innovation."

Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

      "text": "Electric cars -- commonly called electric vehicles or EVs -- are automobiles with engines powered by electricity rather than gas. Electric car stocks comprise companies primarily focused on manufacturing electric cars. Companies that manufacture the components used in electric cars -- such as batteries or autonomous vehicle systems -- can also be considered part of the electric car industry.\nEven though all the major car companies, including Ford (F 3.44%) and General Motors (GM 3.17%), are developing and/or manufacturing at least one model of electric car, they're not usually considered electric car companies because their primary products aren't electric. The best electric car company stocks are generally companies focused solely on electric cars rather than traditional automakers producing primarily gas-powered vehicles.\nList of EV stocks\nElectric car stocks on the map\n| Company | Headquarters | Notable Models |\n|---|---|---|\n| Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) | Palo Alto, California | Model 3 and Model S sedans, Model X and Model Y crossovers |\n| NIO (NYSE:NIO) | Shanghai, China |\nET9 sedan, ES8 and ES6 SUVs, EC6 crossover |\n| Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) | Irvine, California | R1T truck, R1S SUV |\n1. Tesla: An industry leader\nAny list of electric car stocks should include the granddaddy of them all, Tesla. While BYD (BYDDY 3.63%) reported 2024 revenue of about $107 billion compared to the $89 billion that Tesla posted on the top line, Elon Musk's electric car company still demands respect as a force driving the EV industry forward after delivering almost 1.8 million vehicles in 2024. Most of the vehicles were Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossover SUVs, and the rest were Tesla's older, pricier models.\nDespite a tough macroeconomic backdrop, Tesla continues to aggressively expand production. Production is currently ramping up at Tesla's factories in Texas and Germany, and the company is building a new factory in Mexico.\nTesla has resorted to price cuts to sell vehicles this year as consumer demand faltered, a move that has hurt the bottom line. In 2024, Tesla's overall gross margin slipped by 39 basis points year over year to 17.9%, while its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margin contracted slightly to 17% from 17.2% in 2023. The company is still profitable, but profits are trending lower.\nIn the first quarter of 2025, Tesla stock plunged 36% as investors balked at the company's weakening financials and expressed disapproval of Elon Musk's apparent distraction from leading the company due to his activities in Washington, D.C. But shares are still expensive by any measure. With a market capitalization currently topping $833 billion, Tesla stock trades at lofty price-to-earnings and price-to-sales ratios. The valuation makes the stock risky, but there's no denying the company is a leader in the electric vehicle industry.\n2. NIO: A Chinese SUV specialist\nChinese electric car maker NIO has been publicly traded since September 2018, but several initial public offerings (IPOs) by other Chinese electric car makers -- such as Li Automotive (LI 2.56%) and Xpeng(XPEV 4.4%) -- have increased investor interest in NIO.\nNIO is benefitting from strong customer demand in China. After reporting 221,970 vehicle deliveries in 2024 -- a 38.7% increase from 2023 -- NIO reported continued growth in the first quarter of 2025, reporting 42,094 vehicle deliveries in Q1 2025, 40.1% higher than the same period in 2024.\nAs to be expected, total vehicle revenue also rose. In 2024, NIO posted vehicle revenue of about $7.98 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 18.2%. In addition, NIO expanded its gross profit margin from 5.5% in 2023 to 9.9% in 2024.\nNIO further expanded its product line with the deliveries of the ET9 starting in March 2025, a vehicle that NIO characterized as \"a flagship smart executive sedan,\" on its fourth quarter 2024 conference call.\n3. Rivian: An up and comer\nInvestors were very excited about Rivian when the EV company went public in late 2021. It was one of the biggest U.S. IPOs ever, with the company raising almost $12 billion. Rivian's market value briefly topped $150 billion soon after its debut.\nRivian had barely delivered any of its electric trucks or SUVs when it went public, so investing in the stock was the ultimate leap of faith. The company managed to produce more than 1,000 vehicles in 2021, a tiny number compared to Tesla and other large automakers. Deliveries equaled 51,579 vehicles in 2024, and the company projects vehicle deliveries of 46,000 to 51,000 vehicles in 2025. The delivery outlook may be lower than 2024, yet it reflects the company's plan to pause production lines at its plant in Illinois for one month in late 2025 in preparation for the launch of production of the R2 in the first half of 2026.\nRivian is taking a risk by vertically integrating critical components like electronics, the propulsion platform, and software. The strategy may pay off if the company can rapidly grow production over the next few years, but it also means costs will be higher in the near term.\nRivian is driving closer to profitability. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Rivian posted its first quarterly gross profit of $170 million. Rivian has $7.7 billion in cash on its balance sheet, so it can afford to lose vast sums as it ramps up production. But if the company hits a roadblock, it could be in serious trouble.\nRevenue\nRivian stock dove 43% through the first six months of 2024, but it has shown signs of recovering in the second half of the year. The company is valued at just over $14 billion, which doesn't seem expensive relative to sales. A lot will need to go right, though, for Rivian to deliver for investors.\nOther EV companies\nOther companies in the electric car space\nBuilding a successful electric vehicle business is an expensive proposition, and the bankruptcies of Lordstown Motors in 2023 and Fisker in 2024 are good reminders that investing in this sector is inherently risky. After struggling with production issues, Lordstown and Fisker both ultimately filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.\nIf you want to diversify your portfolio exposure to the electric car sector and stay away from controversy, an alternative is to buy stock in any of these companies:\n- QuantumScape (QS 3.62%): Maker of EV lithium batteries\n- Blink Charging (BLNK 6.47%): Producer of electric car charging stations\n- Hyliion (NYSE:HYLN): Manufacturer of EV drivetrains\n- Luminar (LAZR 0.5%): Maker of autonomous driving technologies, such as Lidar\n- Ballard Power Systems (BLDP 6.61%) and Plug Power (PLUG 8.77%): Developers of hydrogen fuel cell vehicle technologies\nYet another option is to buy shares of Lucid Group (LCID -3.11%). After producing 9,029 vehicles in 2024, the luxury electric car maker projects significant growth, forecasting 2025 production of approximately 20,000 vehicles. Lucid delivered 10,241 vehicles in 2024, a 71% increase over that which it delivered in 2023.\nLucid raised about $4.2 billion in additional capital in 2024, which will help cover its losses as it scales up production. Lucid stock is pricey, valued at $7.75 billion despite 2024 revenue of $808 million, so investors should tread carefully.\nETFs\nElectric car ETFs\nInvestors seeking portfolio exposure to the electric car market who don't want to select individual stocks can buy shares in exchange-traded funds (ETFs). There are plenty of options when it comes to electric vehicle ETFs, including some that specialize in clean energy, which are often popular with ESG investors.\nFidelity Electric Vehicles and Future Transportation ETF (FDRV 4.18%) is a fairly small but focused choice and includes many of the stocks noted above. It also includes companies like Uber (UBER 2.62%), ON Semiconductor (ON 6.23%), and ChargePoint (CHPT 4.06%), adding to the diversification of the offering while remaining true to EV-enabling technologies. BYD is the largest holding at just more than 6.3%.\nThe Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF (PBW 5.63%), which tracks the performance of the WilderHill Clean Energy Index, invests broadly in clean energy. Although no single stock comprises more than 2% of the fund's holdings, the ETF owns the stocks of plenty of electric car makers. The stocks of NIO, Tesla, and Rivian are all held by WilderHill. The fund also owns shares of Blink Charging, lithium-ion battery maker Albemarle (ALB 2.98%), and Plug Power.\nThe Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV 3.61%) invests in makers of electric and self-driving cars. But the fund mainly focuses on traditional automakers making forays into this space, such as Toyota (TM 2.08%), and large tech companies, including semiconductor powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA 1.65%) and Alphabet (GOOG 2.98%L) (GOOG 2.98%), which is developing autonomous vehicles.\nWhy the EV industry is different\nWhat makes the electric car industry different?\nThe electric car industry differs from the traditional automotive industry because it is so new. Until recently, very few companies manufactured any kind of electric vehicle, but every major automaker in the world is developing or producing an EV now.\nBecause major interest in electric cars is so recent, the only established industry leader is Tesla. Start-up EV makers can compete fairly well with traditional automakers for electric car market share, making it difficult to discern which companies will ultimately dominate the market. That unpredictability makes investing in the electric car industry riskier than adding portfolio exposure to the automotive industry as a whole.\nRelated investing topics\nFuture of EVs\nThe future of the electric car industry\nMultiple major automakers have recently adopted Tesla's EV charging technology, making it likely to become the standard in the U.S. This standardization should make purchasing and charging EVs simpler, which could help drive growth in the industry.\nMany companies participating in the EV sector are going public, while legacy automakers plan to release a plethora of electric vehicles over the next five years. Investing in this highly competitive and fast-growing industry is likely to be profitable, but it's important to take steps to minimize your investment risk. Don't invest in just one electric car company; hold positions in several companies of various sizes, and consider buying shares in an ETF.\nFAQ\nInvesting in Electric Cars FAQ\nWhich electric car stock is best?\nSince individual investing goals vary, there's no way to categorically say which EV stock is best. For those seeking a more conservative option, Tesla is a good fit since it has already achieved profitability. Investors more focused on growth, however, may find NIO and Rivian more compelling.\nWhat EV company is the next Tesla?\nWhile NIO is often recognized as the Chinese version of Tesla, Lucid has also received strong comparisons to Elon Musk's EV endeavor.\nWhat EV stock can I buy instead of Tesla?\nThere are numerous options for EV investors seeking alternative investments to Tesla. While NIO, Rivian, and Lucid are pure-play EV stocks that represent great options, investors looking to mitigate risk may feel more comfortable choosing an EV ETF.\nWho will dominate the EV market?\nBYD and Tesla are both industry leaders, but time will tell if they are able to maintain their commanding positions."
