He died during the incident.\nThe Atlanta Police Department said the suspect was found dead from a gunshot wound, which may have been self-inflicted. No civilians were shot in the incident, police said.\nMore than a day after the shooting, authorities have not yet provided a possible motive for the shooting.\n\"There is extensive evidence to collect due to the complex scene. Numerous interviews are being conducted. This investigation will take an extended period of time,\" GBI said in a statement.\nThe officer who was killed, DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose, was fatally shot after responding to the reported gunfire.\nHe was taken to the hospital in critical condition where he was pronounced dead, officials said at a press conference Friday evening.\n\"Officer Rose served DeKalb County with courage, integrity, and unwavering dedication. Even in the face of danger was he diligent in his duty to protect our community,\" the police department said in a statement posted online late Friday night.\nAt the earlier press conference, Lorraine Cochran-Johnson, DeKalb County CEO, said it was a \"dark day\" for the county. The officer leaves behind a wife, who is pregnant, and two children, she said.\nThe gunfire broke out at 4:50 p.m., prompting a shelter-in-place order at the university and a lockdown at the CDC headquarters.\nResponding DeKalb County police officers located the suspect on the second floor of the Emory Point CVS Pharmacy across the street from the CDC building and attempted to engage the person when gunfire was exchanged, police said.\nDuring the shooting, the suspect fired multiple rounds at CDC buildings, breaking windows, Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said during an earlier press conference\nIn a video call with employees on Saturday morning, CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez shared her concern for the staff and said she wanted to let them know they are supported by the agency. She shared few details about the extent of the damage to the CDC campus or the ongoing investigation into the shooting. While the shooter fired at CDC buildings, she said law enforcement has not yet confirmed a motive.\nIn an letter emailed to CDC staff on Saturday, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy said the shooting was \"a reminder of the very human challenges public servants sometimes face \u2014 even in places dedicated to healing and progress.\"\nIn a statement on X, Kennedy said, \"We know how shaken our public health colleagues feel today. No one should face violence while working to protect the health of others. We are actively supporting CDC staff on the ground and across the agency. Public health workers show up every day with purpose \u2014 even in moments of grief and uncertainty.\"\nThere were 92 children at a day care center on the CDC campus at the time, who were unharmed, police added.\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, four other people were transported to an area hospital for stress and anxiety-related reasons, the police chief said.\nShortly after the shooting was reported, a shelter-in-place order was put in place on the Emory University campus and later lifted. \"RUN. HIDE. FIGHT. Avoid the area,\" the university said in an alert Friday afternoon.\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp released a statement on X thanking first responders for rushing \"toward the danger to subdue the shooter and save lives.\"\n\"We ask that you join us in holding them in our prayers, along with those harmed this evening near the CDC Center,\" Kemp wrote.\nFBI Atlanta and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation are investigating the incident.\nGeorgia Attorney General Chris Carr released a statement Friday, saying, \"We're horrified by the news out of Emory University and praying for the safety of the entire campus community.\"\nThe White House was monitoring the situation, an official told ABC News.\nABC News' Pierre Thomas, Luke Barr and Kelsey Walsh contributed to this report."

There are 2,700 personnel in the D.C. National Guard.\nThe expectation is that if guardsmen are activated, it would be in a support role to local authorities.\nThe D.C. National Guard is unique in that, unlike other National Guards, it is not under the control of a governor or, in this case, the mayor of D.C., but the president.\nThat authority has been delegated to the defense secretary and the secretary of the Army.\n-ABC News\u2019 Luis Martinez\nAug 10, 2025, 3:40 PM EDT\nVance denies meeting at his residence on Epstein\nVice President JD Vance dismissed reports that a meeting took place at his residence with top administration officials Thursday that involved discussions about convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\"There was no meeting at my house last night. There just wasn't,\" Vance told Fox News\u2019 Maria Bartiromo in an interview that aired on \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d\n\"We did meet at the White House yesterday, but not at the time that they said that they -- that we were going to meet and not about the subject that we -- they said that we were going to meet about,\" Vance said in the interview that was taped on Friday.\n\"We actually didn't talk about the Epstein issue at all. That was never meant to be the subject of the meeting,\" he continued.\nVance said the reports came from someone leaking a calendar entry in which they assumed that it was about Epstein.\nVance reiterated that Trump has called for full transparency, and efforts are underway to compile documents.\n\"On the Epstein issue, what the president has said very clearly, because we have had other meetings about that, is that he wants us to be fully transparent and he wants the credible information out there. So, we're working to compile the thousands and thousands of documents that are out there for full transparency,\" Vance said.\nVance said he supported the decision by Rep.

Mayor Muriel Bowser an opportunity to reduce crime rates but crime has gotten worse.\n\"The Mayor of D.C., Muriel Bowser, is a good person who has tried, but she has been given many chances, and the Crime Numbers get worse, and the City only gets dirtier and less attractive. The American Public is not going to put up with it any longer,\" Trump said in his post.\nContrary to the president's claim, Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department\u2019s preliminary year-to-date crime rate comparison shows that crime in D.C. has decreased by 7% since last year, with violent crime down 26% and property crime reduced by 5%.\n\u201cI will take care of our cherished Capital, and we will make it, truly, GREAT AGAIN!

We just laughed at the whole thing, because neither one of us are focused on politics. We're focused on actually doing a good job for the American people,\" Vance said in the interview that aired on \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d\n\"If we do a good job, number one, that's the reward, in and of itself, that I will have made a big difference in the lives of our country for the last six months, the next 3.5 years. But if we do a good job, the politics will take care of itself,\" he continued.\nDespite Vance trying to navigate away from the topic, he did not dismiss the possibility of running for president in 2028 when asked.\n\"I'm not going to break that news today, Maria,\" he said. \"What I'm going to do is focus for the next year and a half on doing a really good job for the American people, winning the midterm elections in 2026.

      "text": "DEA plans to back reclassifying marijuana as less serious drug, sources say\nIt's a historic shift but wouldn't legalize marijuana outright.\nIn a historic shift, the Drug Enforcement Administration supports recommending the reclassification of marijuana as a less dangerous drug, moving it from a Schedule 1 classification, alongside drugs like heroin and ecstasy, to a Schedule 3 drug, like ketamine, steroids and testosterone, sources told ABC News.\nA source confirmed that the Department of Justice on Tuesday will send its recommendation to the White House's Office of Management and Budget, which will review it, further solidifying a process that will then take several more months.\nThe White House declined to comment, referring all questions to the DOJ, which then announced its decision later on Tuesday.\nIn a statement, department spokesperson Xochitl Hinojosa said: \"Today, the attorney general circulated a proposal to reclassify marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III. Once published by the Federal Register, it will initiate a formal rulemaking process as prescribed by Congress in the Controlled Substances Act.\"\nAs Hinojosa indicated, the Office of Management and Budget will soon initiate a public comment period before the issue gets sent back to DOJ to run their own process, which will include hearings and a review by an administrative judge.\nThe change is far from finalized and, even if approved, the move would not legalize marijuana outright.\nHowever, rescheduling marijuana would have sweeping ramifications for how the federal government treats the drug -- in terms of medical research, taxation and more -- as marijuana has become more widely used across American society.\nA majority of states have legalized marijuana use to varying degrees, including for medicinal purposes, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\u201cWe classify marijuana at the same level as heroin \u2013 and more serious than fentanyl. It makes no sense,\" President Joe Biden tweeted in October 2022, when he asked the Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. attorney general to begin this review process.\nSince then, Biden has also pardoned thousands of people convicted for federal offenses of simple marijuana possession. If the drug is reclassified to Schedule 3, it could impact those charges at the state level.\nABC News' Alexander Mallin contributed to this report."

      "text": "Change in how feds see marijuana could mean big tax cut for pot retailers\nThe biggest impact of reclassifying marijuana could be seen in industry taxes.\nThe Biden administration is rethinking how it classifies marijuana under a federal list of drugs, a move that could allow the cannabis industry to save potentially billions in federal taxes each year because it would allow producers to write off their business expenses.\nThe proposal, recommended by the Department of Health and Human Services and under consideration by the Drug Enforcement Administration, also would open up the possibility that medical researchers could study the benefits and risks of marijuana as a potential drug.\nIndustry advocates called the proposal a welcome development, but one that still falls short of reconciling the federal government's ban on the drug and state laws that accept marijuana use.\n\"The only way to fully resolve the myriad of issues stemming from the federal conflict with state law is to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act and regulate the product in a manner similar to alcohol,\" said National Cannabis Industry Association CEO Aaron Smith in a statement.\nUnder the plan, which could take months to more than a year to finalize, the DEA would no longer regard marijuana as a Schedule I drug. That designation puts marijuana in the same camp as heroin and LSD -- a drug with a high potential for abuse and no medical use. The new plan, if approved, would drop marijuana to Schedule III, easing restrictions and putting it on par with drugs like Tylenol with Codeine.\nThe change though would not alter the drug's status though as illegal under federal law.\nBloomberg first reported the HHS recommendation on Wednesday. A senior administration official confirmed the recommendation to ABC News Thursday.\nLast fall, President Joe Biden said reducing penalties tied to marijuana was a priority.\n\"While white and Black and brown people use marijuana at similar rates, Black and brown people have been arrested, prosecuted, and convicted at disproportionate rates,\" he said in October.\nAndrew Freedman, executive director of the Coalition for Cannabis Policy, Education, and Regulation, said he expects the change would actually do very little to change how marijuana is treated in criminal cases for the average person. That's because such prosecutions tied to marijuana possession are mostly at the state level.\nIn recent years, the Justice Department hasn't made enforcing a federal law banning marijuana as a priority.\nThe much bigger impact, Freedman said, would likely be economically. By reclassifying the drug, cannabis would no longer be subject to an IRS rule that specifically prohibits tax write-offs for businesses \"trafficking\" controlled substances. According to the National Cannabis Industry Association, cannabis pay tax rates as much as 70%.\nBeau Whitney, an economist who specializes in researching the cannabis industry, said he estimates that marijuana businesses could save as much as $2 billion a year or more in their federal tax bill if businesses can deduct their expenses on their tax returns.\nFreedman said that tax benefit is much more likely to be a consequence of rescheduling the drug under the DEA.\n\"Listen, anytime that there's any progress on cannabis in the United States over the last 100 years -- it's a big, huge momentous day,\" he said. And this announcement by a federal agency said \"yeah, we were not treating this rationally,\" he added.\nBut the change won't provide production standards, universal labeling or childproof packaging.\n\"There's a lot more the federal government needs to be stepping in on and this is not any of that,\" he said.\nABC News' Luke Barr and Molly Nagle contributed to this report."

      "text": "Teacher arrested for Arkansas double murder admits to killing married couple: Police\nClinton and Cristen Brink were killed in a state park, police said.\nA 28-year-old teacher has admitted to murdering the married couple found stabbed to death on a walking trail in an Arkansas park over the weekend in what appears to be a \"completely random\" attack, police said.\nAndrew James McGann, 28, of Springdale, Arkansas, was charged with two counts of capital murder in the killings of 43-year-old Clinton David Brink and his wife, 41-year-old Cristen Amanda Brink, Arkansas State Police announced Wednesday evening.\nThe Brinks were \"fatally attacked\" while out hiking with their two daughters at Devil's Den State Park on July 26, police said. The \"horrific\" assault occurred about a half mile into the park, with the husband attacked first, police said.\nThe children, ages 7 and 9, were not harmed in the incident thanks to the actions of their mother, police said.\n\"We believe that the mother took them to safety, and then returned to help her husband,\" Maj. Stacie Rhoads with the Arkansas State Police said during a press briefing Thursday.\nFollowing a dayslong manhunt for the suspect, McGann was arrested shortly before 5 p.m. local time Wednesday at a barbershop in Springdale, about 30 miles north of the park, police said.\nDuring an interview with police, he admitted to killing the couple, Arkansas State Police Director Col. Mike Hagar said during Thursday's press briefing.\nDNA from blood recovered from the crime scene also matched McGann's DNA, Hagar said. The suspect had sustained cuts on his hands during a struggle with the victims, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation.\nItems recovered from his residence were \"consistent with being involved in this particular crime,\" Hagar said.\nMcGann had recently moved to the area from Oklahoma and had been hired to work at a local school, officials said.\nHe was hired to teach in the Springdale Public Schools district this upcoming school year but had not yet begun employment, according to the district's superintendent, Jared Cleveland.\n\"This individual has not at any time come into contact with Springdale students or the families we serve,\" Cleveland said in a statement, adding that no additional information is available at this time due to the ongoing investigation.\n\"Our entire team extends our deepest condolences to the Brink family. Their children are especially in our thoughts and prayers,\" he said.\nMcGann was a fifth grade teacher in Broken Arrows, Oklahoma, during the 2023-2024 school year, the school district said. He passed required background checks, a Broken Arrow Public Schools spokesperson said.\nThe prior school year, he was employed at an elementary school in Flower Mound, Texas, the Lewisville Independent School District confirmed. He was placed on administrative leave in the spring of 2023 \"following concerns related to classroom management, professional judgment, and student favoritism,\" and he ultimately resigned, the school district said.\n\"An internal investigation found no evidence of inappropriate behavior with students,\" the school district added.\nAsked about a motive in the double homicide, Hagar said it remains under investigation, though he did say it appeared to be a \"completely random event.\"\n\"We have no reason to believe that there was any known association between our suspects and our victims,\" Hagar said.\nThe victims died from stab wounds, and the murder weapon was a knife, Hagar said Thursday. Knives were recovered from the residence's home, but it is unclear if any was the murder weapon, Rhoads said.\nHagar said police received over 500 tips and credited the public's help with bringing the suspect into custody.\nArkansas State Police had also released a composite sketch and photo from behind of a man who was seen in Devil's Den State Park on Saturday, the day of the killings. Police asked for the public's help in identifying the man, who they said was wanted for questioning in connection with the double homicide.\nPolice previously said the suspect was seen leaving the area of the park in a black, four-door sedan, possibly a Mazda, with a license plate covered by tape, police said. The vehicle description was \"critical\" in identifying the suspect, Rhoads said.\nThough he took steps to conceal his identity, the suspect was \"very sloppy,\" Rhoads said.\nOnce they identified the suspect, McGann was arrested within an hour at the barbershop, she said.\nPolice do not believe the suspect was trying to alter his appearance in getting a haircut, according to Rhoads, saying, \"Could chalk that up to school starts next week.\"\nThe Brinks had recently moved to Prairie Grove from North Dakota, police said.\nThe children are safe and in the custody of relatives, according to police.\n\"Our entire state is grieving for the tragic loss and senseless and horrific crime that's taken place,\" Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. \"One of the worst experiences that certainly I've ever had was making a phone call to the Brink family earlier this week. Nothing like that should ever have taken place.\"\nHagar said the Brinks were a loving couple, and credited their two young daughters with helping in the case, saying they are \"in awe\" of them.\n\"The information that they were able to provide to start us down this path, to be able to make this arrest, it all started with those two little girls,\" he said. \"It's incredible.\"\nHagar said the couple has a third daughter who wasn't at the trail that day.\n\"It is my intention to use the full weight of my office to bring this defendant to justice for the Brinks family,\" Brandon Carter, the prosecuting attorney for Washington County, said at Thursday's press briefing.\nThe prosecutor's office will not be waiving the death penalty in the case, Carter said.\nMcGann is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Friday, with an arraignment expected next week.\nAll trails at Devil's Den State Park, which were closed following the killings, will remain closed for now, Arkansas Secretary of Parks Shay Lewis said.\nABC News' Sasha Pezenik contributed to this report."
