  "description": "Dallas developer Stonelake Capital Partners remains big player in El Paso industrial market after it sells 7 buildings for $124 million.",
  "content": "One of the big players in El Paso\u2019s industrial real estate market has sold seven buildings in East El Paso for $124 million to an investment fund.\n\nThe El Paso portfolio was one of 13 sale transactions that Stonelake Capital Partners competed for $920 million in the first half of 2025 in six markets, four of which were in Texas, the Dallas company announced in July.\n\nThe sale comes as the El Paso area's industrial property vacancy rate increased to 10.7% in the second quarter of this year, compared to 5.7% in the same quarter in 2024, reported real estate services firm CBRE Group.\n\nThe vacancy rate, which had been steadily increasing in recent months, slowed in the second quarter thanks to strong leasing activity, CBRE reported. However, three large speculative buildings coming on the market without tenants boosted the vacancy rate, CBRE reported.\n\nThe vacancy rate has been increasing since hitting a record low of 0.6% at the end of 2022 as construction of warehousing/distribution centers boomed to meet demand from manufacturers across the U.S.-Mexico border in Jua\u0301rez.\n\nConstruction of new industrial buildings remains strong in El Paso, CBRE reported, even as President Donald Trump's threats of higher tariffs against Mexico add uncertainty in the manufacturing industry in Mexico and the logistics/warehousing sector in El Paso that supports it.\n\nThe Jua\u0301rez industrial vacancy rate also increased in the second quarter to 8.4%, compared to 4.8% in the same quarter in 2024. New industrial construction has slowed in Jua\u0301rez, CBRE reported.\n\nStonelake sold the El Paso properties for $124 million to Invesco, an Atlanta investment firm that bought them for an investment portfolio it manages for the Massachusetts Pension Reserves Investment Management Board, known as MassPRIM, reported John Bryant, a Stonelake investments director. MassPRIM is an investment service for the retirement assets of Massachusetts teachers and other government employees.\n\nThe seven mammoth buildings in East El Paso were purchased by Stonelake in 2017 and 2018, as it began building its industrial building portfolio in Texas and other Sunbelt states, El Paso Central Appraisal District information shows.\n\nMore: El Paso's Hunt gets majority ownership in Atlanta's Carter real estate development firm\n\nFour buildings at 12120 to 12170 Rojas Drive, and another nearby at 1313 Don Haskins Drive, which house warehousing/logistics and manufacturing companies, are in what is known as the Vista Del Sol Industrial Submarket. The other two are at 11350 James Watt Drive, which houses a warehousing/logistics company, and a huge warehouse at 1330 Goodyear Drive.\n\nStonelake remains a major industrial building owner and developer in El Paso and in several other Sunbelt markets.\n\nIt owns 27 industrial buildings in the El Paso market. It's uncertain if it remains the second-largest industrial building owner in this market, as it was in 2022 when it owned 36 buildings.\n\nIt developed, and continues to own the six-building Eastlake Logistics Park, completed in 2024, at Emerald Spring and Rojas drives, next to the giant Amazon fulfillment center, in East El Paso County.\n\nAnd it plans to start construction this summer on the second building in the 375 & Montana Logistics Park, at Montana Avenue and Joe Battle Boulevard in East El Paso, after leasing the industrial park\u2019s first building.\n\n\u201cStonelake will continue to execute on our investment strategy of both acquiring and developing light industrial warehouses to create portfolios of institutional-size and quality in infill locations in markets experiencing significant population growth,\u201d Kenneth Aboussie, Stonelake managing partner, said in a statement.\n\nVic Kolenc may be reached at 915-546-6421; vkolenc@elpasotimes.com; @vickolenc on Twitter, now known as X.",

      "text": "El Paso area in midst of record-setting warehouse and distribution construction boom\nThe El Paso area is in the midst of a record-setting construction boom of huge, multimillion-dollar warehouse/distribution buildings.\nThe boom is mostly fueled by the growing manufacturing industry across the border in Ju\u00e1rez. More companies are moving manufacturing from China to Mexico because of pandemic-related supply chain issues, said Bill Caparis, executive vice president at the El Paso office of CBRE Group, the Dallas-based global commercial real estate services company handling several of the new El Paso industrial projects.\n\u201cThe more (manufacturing) space that gets leased in Ju\u00e1rez, the more demand we see in El Paso,\u201d Caparis said.\nCompanies with plants in Ju\u00e1rez use El Paso as a warehouse and distribution hub. (A list of El Paso projects is at the end of this story).\nThe industrial space vacancy rates in El Paso and Ju\u00e1rez were at record lows at the end of the first quarter: 1.5% in El Paso, and just under 1% in Ju\u00e1rez, CBRE data show.\nAnother reason for the construction boom is pandemic-related supply-chain problems are prompting companies to warehouse more raw materials and finished products than prior to the pandemic, Caparis and others in the industry said.\n\"Just-in-time inventory was the mantra\u201d prior to the pandemic, said Will Brown, managing partner for Sonny Brown Associates, an El Paso commercial real estate services company. \u201cNow, suppliers and producers recognize the need to have more available inventory\u201d and that\u2019s increased the demand for warehouse space, Brown said.\nThe need for \"safety stock to counter supply-chain disruption\" also is fueling demand for warehouse space throughout the United States, a CBRE national report noted.\nThis is the best El Paso-area industrial real estate market and the most construction happening at one time that Caparis has seen in his 26-year real estate career in El Paso, he said.\nAt the end of the first quarter, El Paso\u2019s industrial space construction was at a record pace with 11 buildings containing 4.2 million square feet of space under construction, CBRE reported. Seven of those buildings, with 2 million square feet of space, were speculative projects, meaning they were being built without signed tenants \u2013 the most speculative space construction built in El Paso at one time, the CBRE report stated.\nThat comes after a record-setting 2021, which included construction of the five-story, 2.6-million-square-foot Amazon distribution center in far East El Paso County. Amazon officials previously reported the facility was 625,000 square feet, which is only its footprint.\nMore: 2.6 million square foot Amazon distribution center is largest industrial building in area\nAlmost half of the square footage under construction in the first quarter is a giant distribution center being built by TJX Companies to supply some of its Marshalls clothing stores. CBRE had the building at 1.7 million square feet, but a TJX official recently told the El Paso Times it will be 2 million square feet.\nNeither the Amazon or TJX projects are linked to Mexico.\nIn Ju\u00e1rez, industrial construction also is at a record pace. At the end of the first quarter, 24 buildings, most of those tied to manufacturing, with 5.5 million square feet of space, were under construction, CBRE researchers found. Seventeen of those buildings with 3 million square feet of space, were speculative projects.\nEl Paso had 63 million square feet of industrial space, including manufacturing facilities, at the end of the first quarter of 2022; and Ju\u00e1rez had 77 million square feet, most of that manufacturing space, CBRE reported.\nMost of the new warehouse/distribution building construction is in far East El Paso because companies want to be near the Zaragoza international bridge, one of the nation\u2019s busiest land ports for commercial, border crossings, and to be near the Interstate 10/Loop 375 interchange, key links for truck traffic. Some speculative industrial space also is being built in Santa Teresa, New Mexico \u2014 near El Paso's West Side \u2014 where a land port is located.\nMore: West El Paso's Montecillo continues growing with $80 million in new apartment construction\nRecently completed speculative projects in El Paso are leasing quickly \u2013 mostly to logistics companies, those in the real estate industry reported.\n\"There\u2019s a lot of pent-up demand for industrial space on both sides of the border,\" said Adin Brown, president of Sonny Brown Associates. \u201cThis area in my 38 years (in the commercial real estate business) had some nice increases in inventory at various times, but 2020 through 2022 is the most we\u2019ve seen at one time. It\u2019s exciting action.\"\nCBRE\u2019s Caparis doesn\u2019t see the demand slowing down anytime soon.\n\u201cThere doesn\u2019t appear to be anything we can point to that will change this,\u201d Caparis said. \u201cInterest rates are continuing to rise now; obviously there\u2019s all kinds of things going on around the world that leave a lot of questions. But with the supply-chain issues and the companies through their near-shoring efforts, we think the future for the Mexico markets and border markets will be strong for the foreseeable future.\u201d\nNew industrial building projects\nSome of the new warehouse/distribution projects in the El Paso area:\nConstellation Trade Center\nThree-building, 798,470-square-foot project expected to begin construction this summer on 52.3 acres next to the newly opened El Paso Logistics Center, near the Socorro school district football stadium in East El Paso. Constellation Real Estate Partners, a year-old industrial building developer with offices in Houston and Dallas, and a real estate fund managed by Dallas' Crow Holdings Capital are doing the project.\nEl Paso Logistics Park\nThe 59-acre park\u2019s four-building, 514,135 square-foot first phase was completed in September. Most of the space has been leased to five companies, and a sixth lease is pending for the remaining space, reported a spokesperson for VanTrust Real Estate, a large Kansas City, Missouri, real estate development company overseeing the project. The two-building, 480,504 square-foot second phase is under construction. The park is between Mercantile Avenue and Paseo Del Este Boulevard in East El Paso.\nRojas East Distribution Center\nThe two-building, 369,310-square-foot project at 12590 Rojas Drive, near Eastlake Boulevard, was completed in July and has been leased to two companies. Dallas-based Hunt Southwest Real Estate Development Co., developed and owns the project.\nEastlake Logistics Park\nWalls are rising on the six-building, 1.1 million-square-foot project at Emerald Spring and Rojas drives, next to the new Amazon distribution center in far East El Paso County. The three-building, first phase is expected to be completed by the end of 2022. Stonelake Capital Partners, a Dallas-based commercial real estate developer, is doing the project.\nPan American industrial park additions\nThree warehouses with 304,303 square feet of space at 9577 Plaza Circle and 455 Pan American Drive in the Pan American industrial park, near the Zaragoza international bridge in the Lower Valley. Construction is to be completed in late 2022 and early 2023. The buildings are being developed by a joint venture of Boston's Equity Industrial Partners and New York's Raith Capital Partners on land it acquired in late 2019 along with 22 industrial buildings.\nAmericas Ten 2\nA 168,000-square-foot building almost completed at 12290 Rojas Drive in East El Paso. The $14.1 million project, being done by EastGroup Properties, a Mississippi real estate investment trust and developer, is next to EastGroup's 98,000-square-foot industrial building opened 20 years ago.\nWestpark Building 2\nThe 364,500-square-foot building in the Westpark Logistics Center in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, a part of El Paso's West Side industrial market, is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2022. It's next to the 315,000-square-foot Westpark Building 1 completed in 2021 and fully leased. Blue Road Investments, a Dallas industrial land developer, is the project developer.\nVic Kolenc may be reached at 546-6421; vkolenc@elpasotimes.com; @vickolenc on Twitter."

      "text": "Trump delays Mexico tariffs' hike; most Mexico factory output expected to remain exempt\nEditor's note: This story has been updated with details about 90-day delay of planned, Aug. 1 increase on U.S. tariffs for some Mexico imports.\nThe tariffs are increasing, the tariffs are increasing.\nThat\u2019s been President Donald Trump\u2019s calling card in the first six months of his second presidential term.\nFor Mexico, that means the planned Aug. 1 increase of U.S. tariffs from 25% to 30% on some imports of Mexican-made products is being delayed 90 days.\nTrump announced the extension on a Truth Social platform post Thursday morning.\n\"The complexities of a Deal with Mexico are somewhat different than other Nations because of both the problems, and assets, of the Border,\" Trump wrote.\nSo, he and Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum, during a phone conversation, agreed to extend for 90 days the current tariffs, which include 50% tariffs on Mexico-imported steel, Trump said.\nAnd Mexico agreed to immediately terminate its non-tariff trade barriers, Trump said. He did not give details on the trade barriers, except to say \"there are many.\"\nSheinbaum wrote on a X social media platform post, which is translated in this story from Spanish, \"We had a very good call with United States President Donald Trump. We avoided the tariff increase announced for tomorrow and secured 90 days to build a long-term agreement through dialogue.\"\nEuropean Union deal puts U.S. tariffs at 15%\nThe Mexico extension comes days after the Trump administration reached a deal to lower the tariff on the European Union of 27 countries to 15% from the 30% tariffs planned to also begin Aug. 1.\nThat's still higher than European leaders had wanted. European steel imports to the U.S. will remain at 50%.\nTrump said July 28, that 15% represents the new standard for tariff negotiations, Yahoo Finance reported.\nMexico products made under USMCA expected to be exempt\nThe prevailing opinion in the cross-border trade community is that most imports from Mexico will remain exempt from the U.S. tariffs under the United States Mexico Canada (trade) Agreement, or USMCA, Garrick Taylor, a spokesman for the Border Trade Alliance, an advocacy organization for trade between the U.S. and Mexico, said in an email.\nThat should mean much of the factory production from Mexico, including in Ju\u00e1rez, just across the border from El Paso, should be spared from new tariffs implemented by the Trump administration.\nMany U.S. companies operate factories in Mexico. And many manufacturing suppliers in El Paso and other areas along the U.S.-Mexico border rely on selling parts and other materials to manufacturers in Mexico.\nEl Paso and other border areas in the United States also have a large logistics industry supporting the cross-border trade, marked by the huge warehouse/distribution centers along the border.\nJust over 80% of imports from Mexico to the U.S., are exempted from U.S. tariffs, mainly due to exemptions on goods compliant under the USMCA, the Bloomberg News service recently reported.\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re hopeful that USMCA-compliant trade will remain tariff-free, we are disappointed at the threat of new tariffs and their potential to undermine the strength of the North American economy,\u201d Taylor said\nThe tariffs are taxes paid by companies importing goods to the U.S., from various countries. They are bringing in billions of dollars of revenue to the U.S. treasury, federal officials have said. However, they also can bring product price increases as companies pass on at least some of the tariffs' costs to U.S. customers.\nTariffs increase costs in Texas factories\nPrices for manufacturers' raw materials and finished goods rose further in June in Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Louisiana due to increases in tariffs, including on steel, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas recently reported. Prices for steel made in the U.S. also have risen as demand has increased, it reported.\nThe increase in U.S. tariffs prompted some countries, most notably China, to insitute recripricol tariffs against U.S.-exported products.\nMore: Helen of Troy market value plummets as China tariffs continue to hurt business\nSteel, tomatoes have separate tariffs\nBesides the United States' 30% tariffs planned to begin for some Mexico imports Aug. 1, other tariffs are already in place:\nThe U.S. increased tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from most countries, including Mexico, from 25% to 50% in June.\nHowever, U.S. and Mexico officials are negotiating a deal to reduce or eliminate the tariffs on steel imports up to a certain volume, Reuters news service reported in June.\nThe U.S. imposed a 17.1 % tariff on most tomato imports from Mexico beginning July 14 after the U.S. Department of Commerce ended an agreement with Mexico that suspended the tariff instituted in 1996 after tomato growers in the U.S. petitioned for help because they claimed they were being hurt by dumped imports of Mexican-grown tomatoes, according to the State Department.\nU.S. tomato-grower groups applauded the tariff while U.S. produce importer groups said it will hurt their industry by reducing imports, and hurt consumers who, they said, will pay higher tomato prices.\n\u201cMexico remains one of our greatest allies, but for far too long our farmers have been crushed by unfair trade practices that undercut pricing on produce like tomatoes,\" U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said in a statement released July 14.\nProduce exporters and growers remain concerned about tariffs. Fifteen groups representing produce exporters and growers, several from Canada, in a July 24 letter urged Trump, Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum, and Canada Prime Minister Mark Carney \"to work together to reach a long-term agreement that will restore a stable trading environment for our essential (produce) products.'\nVic Kolenc may be reached at 915-546-6421; vkolenc@elpasotimes.com; @vickolenc on Twitter, now known as X.\nMore: El Paso Electric substation construction boom aims to meet big energy demands"

      "text": "Amazon gives glimpse inside its huge distribution center in East El Paso\nMore than a year after beginning operations, Amazon officials finally opened the doors of its mammoth distribution center in far East El Paso County on Tuesday to give the public a look inside via a news media tour.\nAbout 2,000 people work there to pick, pack and ship about 200,000 to 500,000 products per day for Amazon.com customers, with the help of hundreds of robotic carriers and miles of conveyor belts, said Jon Kot, the facility\u2019s general manager.\nKot, 32, is an El Paso native and Franklin High School graduate who returned home to manage what is officially known as ELP1, an Amazon robotics fast, sortable fulfillment center. He\u2019s worked for Amazon for nine years.\nThe center has little employee turnover and isn't scheduled to hire again until its busier seasons in the summer, when the Amazon Prime Day sale is held, and in the fall for the holiday shopping season, Kot said.\nEighty-five percent of the workforce is full-time, and the others are seasonal workers, Kot said\nThe starting wage is $16 per hour, higher than when the facility opened in November 2021. It also has a strong package of fringe benefits, Kot said.\nMore: El Paso City Council sets $15 per hour minimum wage goal for city workforce\nThe facility has 2.6 million square feet inside five floors and covers about 13 football fields near Eastlake Boulevard and Rojas Drive in a booming commercial area outside the El Paso city limits. It\u2019s the largest industrial building by square footage in El Paso.\nSeveral fast-food outlets, a gas station and a car wash have sprung up along the edges of the Amazon building. And a Home Depot is under construction next to it on Eastlake Boulevard. The new Eastlake Market and Eastlake Commons shopping centers are across the street from the Amazon facility.\nInside the fulfillment center, yellow bins carrying various products zip along conveyor belts to various stations, where workers first unpack items delivered from other Amazon facilities or vendors and then send them to other stations, where they are sorted with the help of tall robotic shelf towers and then sent to be packed by employees at other stations.\nAbout 4,000 robotic carriers and devices and other automated systems are used to speed the processing of orders, Kot said.\nAbout 300 to 600 people work per shift, depending on the volume of orders, Kot said. The facility operates 23 hours per day, with one hour set aside for building maintenance, he said.\nThe El Paso center handles only products that are 18 inches in diameter or less. Bigger items are sent to other Amazon fulfillment centers. Amazon has about 400 fulfillment centers of various sizes in the United States, Kot said.\nThe El Paso center doesn\u2019t ship items directly to Amazon.com customers. That\u2019s done mostly through Amazon delivery facilities, all located in other cities. One was expected to be built on city government-owned land in West El Paso, but the land deal collapsed.\nVic Kolenc may be reached at 546-6421; vkolenc@elpasotimes.com; @vickolenc on Twitter."
