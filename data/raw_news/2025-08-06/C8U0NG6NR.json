  "title": "Minnesota meteorologist Nick Jansen blasted for texting wife during severe weather report: \u2018Unprofessional\u2019",
  "description": "Bad weather cell phone.",
  "content": "A Minnesota meteorologist is being dragged by viewers as \u201cunprofessional\u201d for texting his wife live on air during severe weather coverage.\n\nKTTC News Chief Meteorologist Nick Jansen was three hours into his reporting on storms walloping the Rochester, Minn., region on July 28, when he was caught using his phone to make sure his family \u2014 including his 6-month-old child \u2014 found shelter.\n\n\u201cI received an email telling me how unprofessional I was during my coverage. The quote that really struck me: \u201cThat he has to call his wife to make sure she takes the baby to safety? Maybe some people think it\u2019s noble or cute. I don\u2019t,'\u201d Jansen wrote on Facebook with the now-viral video of the 10-second clip.\n\nThe caught-on-camera moment happened when Jansen was in the studio, standing in front of the radar screen, waiting for news director Zach Fuller to wrap up a power outage update.\n\nJansen, 32, was captured on video looking down at his phone, seemingly unaware he was on live TV.\n\nHe managed to get the text off before the report was sent back to him.\n\n\u201cSorry, just had to text my wife, baby was sleeping well tonight so that\u2019s gonna be over with at this point in time,\u201d Jansen said as he resumed his weather reporting duties.\n\nThe chief meteorologist and family man estimated strong winds in the Rochester area could reach between 40 to 70 mph.\n\nJansen defended his actions amid the viewer\u2019s backlash, saying he was looking out for his family while he had a brief moment off-camera during the broadcast.\n\n\u201cI take my job and your safety very seriously. But I\u2019m also a husband and a father,\u201d Jansen responded to the viewer. \u201cIn the middle of severe weather, I decided to take a brief moment to make sure my wife and child were safely in the basement.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not me being unprofessional, it\u2019s me being human. I am a husband and a father FIRST. Let\u2019s all try to show each other a little more understanding and respect in life,\u201d he added.\n\nJansen doubled down on his assessment of the on-air blooper as an acceptable act from a loving father.\n\n\u201cWhen I received this latest email, I was like, you know what? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s acceptable that I can\u2019t take a second to make sure my loved ones are OK,\u201d Jansen told TODAY. \u201cI\u2019m sure a lot of viewers were texting their families. And we always say on-air, \u2018If you know someone in such-and-such a town, make sure to let them know this is coming.\u2019 So I was kind of taking my own advice.\u201d\n\nStation executives praised Jansen for thinking of his family while keeping the viewers informed of the danger they faced in the inclement weather.\n\n\u201cThe KTTC team is proud of Nick and the work he and the First Alert weather team did Monday night and the work they continue to do to keep our communities safe,\u201d station Vice-President and General Manager Stephanie Hedrick said in a statement.\n\n\u201cKTTC knows that when our meteorologists, anchors and reporters are delivering the news, they are also talking to their own families- informing them and helping to keep them safe. In this case, viewers saw that happen live \u2013 Nick being a good husband and dad by taking a moment and making sure they were safe.\u201d\n\nOther viewers applauded Jansen for taking the time to check in on his family.\n\n\u201cTexting your wife in the middle of a broadcast was my signal to take the storm seriously. I now have a new level of storm seriousness,\u201d one person commented.\n\n\u201cI support you! I thought it chivalry at it\u2019s best!\u201d another added.\n\nThe massive storm cell blew across the Gopher State and the surrounding Midwest in the late evening of July 28, producing damaging winds up to 75 mph and causing power outages for thousands of customers, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe strongest wind gust was measured at 92 mph at the Spencer Municipal Airport in Spencer, Iowa, approximately 200 miles southwest of the KTTC studios.\n\nKTTC is a dual affiliate of NBC and CW+, covering southeastern Minnesota and northeastern Iowa.",

      "text": "A Minnesota meteorologist stirred up a storm of his own by texting his wife during a live broadcast.\nNick Jansen had been in the KTTC studio for three hours on July 28, tracking severe weather across the Twin Cities with his team. During a colleague\u2019s power outage update, the cameras cut to Jansen, who was caught with his head down, typing on his phone.\nJansen, 32, quickly apologized to viewers, explaining that he was making sure his wife, Angie, and their 5-month-old daughter, Jamie, were secure in the basement.\nIn an interview with TODAY.com, Jansen said Angie typically goes to bed early, but he asked her to keep her ringer on in case the weather worsened.\nAfter sending the message, Jansen then continued reporting on thunderstorms and wind gusts exceeding 76 miles per hour.\nLater, Jansen received an email from a viewer, which he addressed in a Facebook post that has since gone viral. The message accused him of being \u201cunprofessional,\u201d but it was one line in particular that struck a nerve: \u201cThat he has to call his wife to make sure she takes the baby to safety? Maybe some people think it\u2019s noble or cute. I don\u2019t.\u201d\nWhile speaking to TODAY, Jansen revealed that a few years earlier, he had texted Angie during a tornado warning that directly impacted their home, and received backlash for that as well.\n\u201cSo when I received this latest email, I was like, you know what? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s acceptable that I can\u2019t take a second to make sure my loved ones are OK,\u201d Jansen says. \u201cI\u2019m sure a lot of viewers were texting their families. And we always say on-air, \u2018If you know someone in such-and-such a town, make sure to let them know this is coming.' So I was kind of taking my own advice.\"\nRather than simply brushing off the criticism, Jansen responded with honesty and vulnerability, offering a glimpse into the difficult balance between his professional responsibilities and his role at home.\n\u201cIn the middle of severe weather, I decided to take a brief moment to make sure my wife and child were safely in the basement,\u201d Jansen wrote on Facebook. \u201cThat\u2019s not me being unprofessional, it\u2019s me being human. I am a husband and a father FIRST. Let\u2019s all try to show each other a little more understanding and respect in life.\u201d\nKTTC vice president and general manager Stephanie Hendrick praised Jansen and the First Alert weather team for their dedication to keeping the public informed and protected.\n\u201cKTTC knows that when our meteorologists, anchors and reporters are delivering the news, they are also talking to their own families- informing them and helping to keep them safe,\u201d Hendrick said in a statement. \u201cIn this case, viewers saw that happen live \u2014 Nick being a good husband and dad by taking a moment and making sure they were safe.\u201d"

      "text": "Extreme heat will begin to peak across the Desert Southwest. Multiple days of hot, dry and windy conditions are expected to bring fire weather concerns for portions of the Four Corners region into the central Great Basin and Rockies. Heavy rainfall and a flash flooding threat continues in the Southeast. Poor air quality persists from the Upper Midwest into the Northeast due to wildfire smoke. Read More >\nOverview\n|\nA line of thunderstorms developed over western MN and progressed eastward during the evening of July 28th, 2025. As this line of storms reached eastern MN, storm intensity increased producing 60 to 70 mph damaging wind gusts across the Twin Cities metro down to Mankato. These storms the continued on into western WI and southeast MN. Reports of trees down and power outages were reported across several areas that the storm had moved through. A couple noteworthy measured gusts were at the Owatonna airport in Steele Co at 70mph, and Rochester airport in Olmstead County at 76 mph. Meanwhile, a second area of storms produced significant damaging wind across northern Iowa. The strongest wind gusts from this event were at the airport in Spencer, IA with 92 mph and airport near Waterloo, IA at 78 mph.\n|\nEnvironment\nThe near storm environment was driven primarily by large instability. This was due to steep mid level lapse rates overtop a warm and humid airmass south of a warm front. The storms developed across that Dakotas and western Minnesota, and moved into east/southeast during the late evening and overnight.\n| July 29, 00Z 500mb heights and wind showing west-to-east flow across the Upper Midwest. | July 29, 00Z surface map showing a warm front across southern Minnesota. | July 29, 00Z forecast sounding from the NWS Twin Cities forecast office in Chanhassen MN showing steep mid level lapse rates, and increasing winds aloft. |\n| July 29, 00Z 700mb to 500mb Lapse rates showing values 8.5 to 9 C/km! This allowed a strong cold pool to develop, which factored into the longevity of the system. | July 29, 00Z MLCAPE showing the highest values across northwest Iowa, with a gradient over southwest Minnesota. | July 29, 00Z Derecho Composite parameter was highest across northwest Iowa.

She never had the courage to do so. No talent, no ratings, no strength!!\u201d\nCBS declined to comment.\nThe Post reported that CBS faces a growing dilemma over the future of the mega-buck anchor as ratings for her \u201cwoke\u201d morning show collapse, while the struggling network\u2019s new owners vow to root out left-wing bias.\nKing is part of a culture that has \u201cdug in\u201d against attempts by higher-ups to move away from polarizing coverage, sources close to the situation told The Post.\nThe article also revealed that \u201cCBS Mornings'\u201d executive producer Shawna Thomas under King has created an \u201cagenda-driven\u201d program that has alienated the majority of the country, sources claimed.\nThey said the head producer has pushed back on orders from top brass to run stories that appeal to the entire country.\n\u201cThe audience doesn\u2019t want woke.

      "text": "Moment during KTTC\u2019s severe weather coverage leads to viral post\nROCHESTER, Minn. (KTTC) \u2013 KTTC\u2019s Chief Meteorologist Nick Jansen and the First Alert Weather Team continuously works hard to give the First Alert to changing weather and to keep viewers safe when weather turns severe.\nKTTC was the first on the air and the last off the air Monday night into Tuesday morning when KTTC was on the air for nearly three hours covering storms in Southeastern Minnesota and Northern Iowa.\nDuring the nearly three-hour coverage and while another KTTC reporter was reporting area power outages, the camera showed Jansen taking a moment to text his wife at home, to make sure she and their nearly 6-month-old baby were awake and going to the basement to safety during the storms.\nOne viewer email to KTTC about Jansen ensuring his family was okay, sparked this viral Facebook post on Jansen\u2019s professional page.\nIn part, Jansen saying, \u201cI take my job and your safety very seriously. But I\u2019m also a husband and a father. In the middle of severe weather, I decided to take a brief moment to make sure my wife and child were safely in the basement. That\u2019s not me being unprofessional, it\u2019s me being human. I am a husband and a father FIRST. Let\u2019s all try to show each other a little more understanding and respect in life.\u201d\nReaction to the post from the public and KTTC viewers has been extremely positive in supporting Nick taking a moment to check on his family. KTTC also fully supports Nick taking the time to do so.\n\u201cThe KTTC team is proud of Nick and the work he and the First Alert weather team did Monday night and the work they continue to do to keep our communities safe,\u201d said KTTC Vice-President and General Manager Stephanie Hedrick. \u201cThat includes their own families. KTTC knows that when our meteorologists, anchors and reporters are delivering the news, they are also talking to their own families- informing them and helping to keep them safe. In this case, viewers saw that happen live - Nick being a good husband and dad by taking a moment and making sure they were safe. Thank you to all those who support our team during such moments. We hope all know the importance of such safety measures during severe weather.\u201d\n\u201cWhether its you, the viewer\u2019s family or our own personal families, KTTC\u2019s First Alert Weather Team wants to make sure everyone is safe,\u201d said News Director Zach Fuller. \u201cWe are extremely blessed to have someone like Nick Jansen leading our team.

      "text": "Gayle King\u2019s future at CBS murky as ratings for \u2018woke\u2019 morning show tank \u2014 and Skydance vows to scrap left-wing bias\nCBS faces a growing dilemma over the future of mega-buck anchor Gayle King as ratings for her \u201cwoke\u201d morning show collapse \u2014 and the struggling network\u2019s new owners vow to root out left-wing bias, The Post has learned.\nThe \u201cCBS Mornings\u201d co-host, one of the fading Tiffany Network\u2019s few remaining stars, is part of a culture that has \u201cdug in\u201d against attempts by higher-ups to move away from polarizing coverage, according to sources with knowledge of the situation.\nA key problem is that George Cheeks \u2014 the co-CEO of CBS parent Paramount who is in line to run the network under new overlords Skydance Media \u2014 has for years promoted a diversity, equity and inclusion mandate, the sources said.\nThat has allowed 70-year-old King and her executive producer Shawna Thomas to set a programming \u201cagenda\u201d that has alienated traditional morning show viewers, one of the sources close to the situation told The Post.\n\u201cThe audience doesn\u2019t want woke. It doesn\u2019t like progressive and provocative bookings,\u201d one of the sources told The Post. \u201cThe morning show audience wants optimism and cheer and joy and what they were producing is at odds with audience expectations.\u201d\nOne insider pointed to a March 26 interview with \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d winner Bob the Drag Queen, who was publicizing his first novel, \u201cHarriet Tubman: Live in Concert.\u201d\nThe \u201cCBS Mornings\u201d website described the book as a \u201cgender-bending story where the historic icon appears in modern-day America to tell her story through a hip-hop album,\u201d as previously reported by The Post.\nThe perennially last-place show \u2014 once regarded as a cash cow for the beleaguered news division \u2014 has seen its ratings plummet to below 2 million in recent months.\nIn the past three weeks, King and co-hosts Tony Dokoupil and Nate Burleson lost between 20% and 30% of their audience versus last year in the advertiser-coveted 25- to 54-year-old demographic, according to Nielsen.\nKing signed an extension for between $13 million and $15 million that runs through next May, according to a well-placed source. That\u2019s the same month CBS will pull the plug on late-night host Stephen Colbert and his reported $15 million-a-year contract.\n\u201cThe Late Show\u201d reportedly lost $40 million to $50 million last year, The Post reported. A person with knowledge said \u201cCBS Mornings\u201d is profitable, despite its waning ratings.\nGiven the plummeting viewership, Skydance likely won\u2019t offer King the same cushy deal again, the source added.\nCBS declined to comment. King did not respond to requests seeking comment.\nThe anchor joined the morning show in 2012 and has since weathered a revolving door of CBS News presidents. In May, Wendy McMahon left over CBS\u2019 impending settlement with President Trump over the editing of a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with Kamala Harris.\nMcMahon, who was brought in as co-president in 2021 and was handed the reins in 2023 after Neeraj Khemlani got canned, was charged by Cheeks to make the morning show more appealing to middle America, two sources with knowledge told The Post.\nBut her directives were allegedly ignored by Thomas, one of the few African American executive producers in TV, in favor of programming for niche audiences who are black, LGBTQ or other minorities, the sources said.\nTwo insiders said Thomas didn\u2019t push back directly on McMahon\u2019s orders, she just \u201cdidn\u2019t do what she was told.\u201d\nA source close to the situation said Thomas views herself as a major journalist who wants to do heavy reporting and provocative interviews with edgy guests \u2014 but noted that it\u2019s an awkward fit for morning TV.\nDespite recent cost-cutting by Paramount, McMahon didn\u2019t fire Thomas because the producer had King\u2019s support, according to sources.\nMcMahon did not respond to requests for comment.\n\u201cIn these cases, you have to fire somebody,\u201d one longtime producer told The Post. \u201cWendy McMahon was not strong enough. She needed a head on a stick but Shawna had the protection of Gayle King.\u201d\n\u201cExecutive producers are the servants of the anchors,\u201d the source added. \u201cThey don\u2019t survive unless they do what the anchors tell them.\u201d\nThe insider remarked that aside from woke programming, many viewers were \u201calienated\u201d by the fact that none of the show\u2019s anchors \u2014 aside from Dokoupil \u2014 are white. In addition, the majority of the show\u2019s substitute anchors are African American, due in part to initiatives to diversify the talent pool over the years.\nA source said top brass attempted to address the issue, recently hiring Rob Marciano, a former \u201cGood Morning America\u201d weatherman who was dumped by ABC over alleged anger management issues, The Post previously reported.\nThe show\u2019s ratings quickly got worse after the presidential election, sources said, explaining that \u201cCBS Mornings\u201d staffers felt gut-punched after Harris lost.\nAccording to one insider, \u201cCBS Mornings lost its curveball\u201d when Trump was elected and the staff were unable to hide their \u201cdistaste\u201d for the result and were \u201cshocked,\u201d \u201csad\u201d and unable to recover.\nMcMahon hired Tom Cibrowski, a former \u201cGMA\u201d senior producer, to help amp up the ratings and work with Thomas, who was hired in 2021 after previous stints at NBC News and Vice Media.\nTwo sources said Thomas was initially supportive of his ideas to tweak programming, but that Cibrowski soon hit similar roadblocks. A source close to the network said Cibrowski and Thomas have established a good working relationship.\nCibrowski was named CBS News boss after McMahon\u2019s exit.\nMajor changes are expected to take place when independent studio Skydance, led by CEO David Ellison, grabs the reins. The FCC finally cleared its $8.4 billion merger with Paramount last week and the deal is expected to close Aug. 7.\nTo get FCC approval, Skydance pledged to hire an ombudsman to monitor for any political bias at CBS News. Paramount also eliminated its DEI policies.\nNonetheless, Ellison and his right-hand man Jeff Shell, former CEO of NBCUniversal, will need to make a seismic change to alter the culture and boost ratings, sources said, pointing to the fact that the FCC recently said Skydance has committed to eliminate DEI programs at Paramount.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of internal politics,\u201d another CBS insider said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018Hunger Games.\u2019 Everybody\u2019s focused on that and yet they are mired in third place and have been for decades.\u201d\nA fourth insider with deep knowledge of the network culture and organization added: \u201cThe culture at CBS News prevents progress.\u201d\n\u201cThere is something just ingrained in a place that was once so great that they can\u2019t quite see the fact that to remain and be great again \u2014 whatever that looks like in 2025 and beyond \u2014 it requires doing things differently.\u201d"

Screams artificial, fake, enhanced, trying too hard,\u201d Kelly wrote.\nThe Post has sought comment from Kelly, Sweeney, Beyonc\u00e9 and Levi Strauss & Co.\nSweeney\u2019s ad created a firestorm over its wordplay between \u201cjeans\u201d and \u201cgenes,\u201d with critics arguing the double entendre promoted harmful beauty standards and even evoked eugenic ideals.\nOver the weekend, President Trump praised the ad as the \u201chottest ad out there\u201d and celebrated Sweeney\u2019s reported Republican registration.\nAmerican Eagle stock has shot up by roughly 30% following Trump\u2019s endorsement and the viral attention.\nThe company has defended its campaign, stating that the ad \u201cis \u2014 and always was \u2014 about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story.\u201d\nAmerican Eagle emphasized its commitment to celebrating how everyone wears their jeans with confidence.\nEarlier this year during an appearance on Australia\u2019s Sky News, Kelly accused Beyonc\u00e9 of \u201cplaying victim\u201d after discovering that the singer\u2019s world tour features footage of the podcaster criticizing her entry into country music.\nThe host of the SiriusXM podcast \u201cThe Megyn Kelly Show\u201d ripped Beyonc\u00e9 for \u201csticking her big toe\u201d into country music when the singer\u2019s genre-crossing album was released.\n\u201cBeyonc\u00e9, who\u2019s on some world tour right now reinventing herself as a country star, is running videotape during the show of yours truly,\u201d Kelly said in the segment, titled \u201cBeyonce Tries Playing Victim.\u201d\nKelly characterized Beyonc\u00e9 as \u201canother one of the most privileged, beloved women in the world \u2014 and richest, based on her own fortune, never mind the man she\u2019s married to,\u201d referencing the singer\u2019s billionaire husband Jay-Z.\nDespite this status, Kelly argued that Beyonc\u00e9 \u201cstill has to look for the one sliver where she could play the victim and be aggrieved because big bad Megyn Kelly said something completely milquetoast about her entry into country music.\u201d\nBeyonc\u00e9 became the first black woman to reach No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart with her lead single \u201cTexas Hold \u2018Em.\u201d\nHer \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d album also achieved massive commercial and critical success, topping the Billboard 200 and ultimately winning both album of the year and best country album at the 2025 Grammy Awards.\nBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s Levi\u2019s collaboration draws inspiration from classic Levi\u2019s commercials of the 1980s and 1990s, featuring cinematic scenes that include Beyonc\u00e9 riding a motorcycle, and appearing in laundromat and pool hall settings.\nIndustry observers have credited Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s partnership with substantially increasing Levi\u2019s global sales and brand visibility, particularly among younger, fashion-forward demographics."
