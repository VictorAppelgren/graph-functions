  "description": "COVID-19 vaccines are now available only for high-risk groups under new FDA marketing authorization, as emergency use authorizations are officially rescinded.",
  "content": "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorized COVID-19 vaccines for the fall \u2014 but only for high-risk groups.\n\nHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy announced the FDA\u2019s most recent actions on Wednesday in a post on X.\n\n\"I promised 4 things,\" Kennedy wrote. \"1. to end covid vaccine mandates; 2. to keep vaccines available to people who want them, especially the vulnerable; 3. to demand placebo-controlled trials from companies; 4. to end the emergency.\"\n\nLARGEST MEASLES OUTBREAK IN US IS OFFICIALLY OVER, HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY\n\n\"In a series of FDA actions today we accomplished all four goals.\"\n\nIn the post, RFK stated that the FDA has issued \"marketing authorization\" for high-risk groups for the following vaccines: Moderna (6 months and older), Pfizer (5 years and older) and Novavax (12 and up).\n\n\"These vaccines are available for all patients who choose them after consulting with their doctors,\" RFK wrote.\n\nHigh-risk groups include older adults over 65 and those who are more likely to develop severe COVID illness.\n\nMEDICAL GROUP GOES AGAINST CDC, RECOMMENDS COVID SHOTS FOR YOUNG KIDS\n\nOn its website, the CDC lists conditions that may increase the risk of severe COVID, including asthma, cancer, heart conditions, cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, dementia, mood disorders, obesity, Parkinson\u2019s, and chronic disease of the lungs, liver or kidneys, among many others.\n\nRFK also announced that the emergency use authorizations for COVID vaccines have been rescinded.\n\n\"The American people demanded science, safety, and common sense,\" RFK went on. \"This framework delivers all three.\"\n\nBefore this change, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had recommended the vaccine for all Americans 6 months and older.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn May 2025, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that COVID-19 vaccines would be removed from the CDC\u2019s routine immunization schedule for healthy children and .\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\nInstead of a universal recommendation, the CDC\u2019s updated guidance calls for \"shared clinical decision-making,\" in which parents and doctors discuss the benefits and risks of vaccination for each individual case.\n\nHowever, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) still includes it in its annual immunization schedule, as Fox News Digital previously reported.\n\n\"It should be a conversation between the pediatrician, patient and parent, and should depend on the child\u2019s health as well as the current state of COVID,\" Dr. Marc Siegel, Fox News senior medical analyst, previously told Fox News Digital.",

      "text": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) no longer recommends the COVID-19 vaccine for children \u2014 but a major medical group is going against that guidance.\nOn Tuesday, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) released its latest annual immunization schedule for children \u2014 and it includes vaccines for COVID-19, in addition to flu and RSV.\n\"Infants and children 6 through 23 months of age are at the highest risk for severe COVID-19,\" the AAP states in its release.\nCANCER VACCINE SHOWS PROMISE IN PREVENTING RECURRENCE OF PANCREATIC, COLORECTAL TUMORS\n\"Given this, the AAP recommends a COVID-19 vaccine for all children ages 6 through 23 months old to help protect against serious illness.\"\nThe AAP also recommends a \"single dose of age-appropriate COVID-19 vaccine\" for kids and teens 2 and older who are at high risk of severe COVID, have never been vaccinated before, and who live with people who are at a high risk of severe disease.\n\"The AAP also recommends the vaccine be available for children aged 2-18 who do not fall into these risk groups, but whose parent or guardian desires them to have the protection of the vaccine,\" the release states.\nDOCTOR REVEALS THE SECRET WEAPON AGAINST GROWING VACCINE SKEPTICISM WORLDWIDE\n\"Among the reasons we decided to move to a risk-based recommendation for healthy older children is the fact that the hospitalization rate for young children and children with underlying medical conditions remains high, in line with rates for many of the other vaccine-preventable diseases for which we vaccinate,\" said Sean O\u2019Leary, M.D., chair of the AAP Committee on Infectious Diseases, in the release.\nIn May 2025, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that COVID-19 vaccines would be removed from the CDC\u2019s routine immunization schedule for healthy children and pregnant women.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nInstead of a universal recommendation, the CDC\u2019s updated guidance calls for \"shared clinical decision-making,\" in which parents and doctors discuss the benefits and risks of vaccination for each individual case.\n\"Where the parent presents with a desire for their child to be vaccinated, children 6 months and older may receive COVID-19 vaccination, informed by the clinical judgment of a healthcare provider and personal preference and circumstances,\" the CDC\u2019s guidance states.\nIn total, the AAP\u2019s schedule includes immunizations against 18 diseases, recommended for all children from birth to age 18.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\nThe AAP noted in a press release that its vaccine schedule \"differs from recent recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the CDC.\"\nOther included updates involve the pentavalent meningococcal vaccine, the starting age of the human papilloma virus vaccine, and removal of a hepatitis vaccine that is no longer available, the release states.\nDr. Marc Siegel, Fox News senior medical analyst, said that for high-risk children, the COVID vaccines \"make a lot of sense.\"\n\"There are risks, but the myocarditis risk is less than from COVID itself, and is mostly after the second booster in the weeks afterward,\" he told Fox News Digital.\n\"It should be a conversation between the pediatrician, patient and parent, and should depend on the child\u2019s health as well as the current state of COVID.\"\n\"It should be a conversation between the pediatrician, patient and parent, and should depend on the child\u2019s health as well as the current state of COVID.\"\nHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. responded to the AAP's guidelines in a post on X.\nFor more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health\n\"AAP today released its own list of corporate-friendly vaccine recommendations. The Trump administration believes in free speech and AAP has a right to make its case to the American people. But AAP should follow the lead of HHS and disclose conflicts of interest, including its corporate entanglements and those of its journal \u2014 Pediatrics \u2014 so that Americans may ask whether the AAP\u2019s recommendations reflect public health interest, or are, perhaps, just a pay-to-play scheme to promote commercial ambitions of AAP\u2019s Big Pharma benefactors. AAP should also be candid with doctors and hospitals that recommendations that diverge from the CDC\u2019s official list are not shielded from liability under the 1986 Vaccine Injury Act.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to the AAP requesting comment."

      "text": "The measles outbreak in Texas has officially ended.\nIn a Monday press release, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) reported the end of the outbreak, which centered in West Texas.\nThe announcement was made after no new cases were reported for more than 42 days in counties that had previously shown evidence of ongoing transmission.\nMORE STATES NOW REPORTING MEASLES CASES: SEE WHERE OUTBREAKS HAVE SPREAD\nAs of Aug. 18, a total of 762 measles cases have been confirmed in Texas since the outbreak began in late January.\nOne of the first cases was in Gaines County, where a total of 414 infections were reported.\nThe virus has spread across the U.S. during 2025, marking a total of 1,356 confirmed cases in the country as of Aug. 5, according to the CDC.\nMore than two-thirds of Texas cases affected school-aged children. A total of 99 people were hospitalized and two children died.\nFLY SAFELY AMID MEASLES OUTBREAK WITH THESE IMPORTANT TRAVEL TIPS\nIn a statement, DSHS Commissioner Jennifer A. Shuford, M.D., highlighted the \"tireless work\" of public health professionals across Texas, who \"contributed to the containment of one of the most contagious viruses.\"\n\"We arrived at this point through a comprehensive outbreak response that included testing, vaccination, disease monitoring and educating the public about measles through awareness campaigns,\" Shuford added.\n\"I also want to recognize the many healthcare professionals who identified and treated cases of a virus that most providers had never seen in person before this outbreak.\"\nPotential risks remain\nForty-two days is double the disease\u2019s maximum incubation period, according to DSHS, which is why experts consider the outbreak to be over.\nBut the threat of measles still looms, as ongoing outbreaks exist in North America and other areas of the world, which will \"likely\" lead to additional measles cases in Texas this year.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\"Healthcare providers should continue to be vigilant and test for measles if their patient has symptoms compatible with the virus,\" the DSHS wrote in a press release.\n\"Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness, which can cause life-threatening illness to anyone who is not protected against the virus.\"\nAbout one in five children who get sick will require hospitalization during a measles outbreak, and one in 20 will develop pneumonia, according to state health officials.\nIn rare cases, measles can lead to brain swelling and death, as well as pregnancy complications.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe best way to prevent measles is through vaccination, per the guidance of DSHS and other public health experts.\nThis includes two doses of a measles-containing immunization, primarily administered as the MMR vaccine.\n\"It\u2019s a factor of several times more contagious,\" he said, noting that one infected person can impact about 10 to 15 other people.\nFor more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health\nTo protect against infection, Whyte emphasized the need to be aware of your surroundings and wear a mask in areas where cases have been detected.\nHe also recommended practicing \"good handwashing\" after touching surfaces, as well as keeping surfaces clean, as virus droplets can stick and spread when contact is made."
