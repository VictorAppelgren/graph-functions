  "title": "ICE is showing up to interview parents hoping to reunite with their children who entered U.S. alone",
  "description": "Legal advocacy groups say the shift has led to the arrest of some parents, while their children remain in U.S. custody.",
  "content": "People wait for loved ones from Guatemala deported from the United States outside La Aurora International Airport, in Guatemala City, Sunday, Aug. 31, 2025.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s administration has started requiring parents looking to reunite with their children who crossed into the U.S. alone to show up for interviews where immigration officers may question them, according to a policy memo obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nLegal advocacy groups say the shift has led to the arrest of some parents, while their children remain in U.S. custody. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not confirm that or answer questions about the July 9 directive, instead referring in a statement to the Biden administration\u2019s struggles to properly vet and monitor homes where children were placed.\n\nThe Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department and which takes custody of children who cross the border without a parent or legal guardian, issued the directive. The agency said the goal is to ensure that sponsors \u2014 usually a parent or guardian \u2014 are properly vetted.\n\nThe memo is among several steps the Trump administration has taken involving children who came to the U.S. alone. Over the Labor Day weekend it attempted to remove Guatemalan children who were living in shelters or with foster care families.\n\nThe July 9 memo regarding sponsors said they must now appear in person for identification verification. Previously, sponsors could submit identity documents online. The directive also says \u201cfederal law enforcement agencies may be present to meet their own mission objectives, which may include interviewing sponsors.\u201d\n\nNeha Desai, managing director of human rights at the National Center for Youth Law, said the change provides U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a \u201cbuilt-in opportunity\u201d to arrest parents \u2014 something she said has already happened.\n\nMary Miller Flowers, director of policy and legislative affairs for the Young Center for Immigrant Children\u2019s Rights, said she knew of a case in which immigration officers arrested the father of a child under the age of 12 who had shown up for an identification check. \u201cAs a result, mom is terrified of coming forward. And so, this child is stuck,\u201d Miller Flowers said.\n\nDesai also said the interviews are unlikely to produce information authorities don\u2019t already have. Vetting already included home studies and background checks done by Office of Refugee Resettlement staff, not immigration enforcement.\n\nThe Office of Refugee Resettlement said it communicates \u201cclearly and proactively\u201d with parents, telling them they may be interviewed by ICE or other law enforcement officials. It said parents can decline to be interviewed by ICE and that refusal won\u2019t influence decisions about whether their children will be released to them.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to ensure that every child is released to a stable and safe environment and fully vetted sponsors by ensuring the potential sponsor is the same individual submitting supporting documentation, including valid ID,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nHowever, Desai is aware of a situation in which a sponsor was not notified and only able to decline after pushing back.\n\n\u201cWe know of sponsors who are deeply, deeply fearful because of this interview, but some are still willing to go forward given their determination to get their children out of custody,\u201d she said.\n\nTricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security spokesperson, issued a statement that did not address any arrests or mention the specific changes. Instead, she said the department is looking to protect children who were released under President Joe Biden\u2019s administration.\n\nA federal watchdog report released last year addressed the Biden\u2019s administration struggles during an increase in migrant children arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2021. The Trump administration has dispatched Homeland Security and FBI agents to visit the children.\n\nAnother recent change allows ICE to interview children while they are at government-run shelters. That took effect July 2, according to a separate directive that the Office of Refugee Resettlement sent to shelters, also obtained by the AP.\n\nThe agency said it provides legal counsel to children and that its staff does not participate in interviews with law enforcement. Child legal advocates say they get as little as one-hour notice of the interviews, and that the children often don\u2019t understand the purpose of the interview or are misled by officers.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t understand what the interview is for or where the information is going, are we really consenting to this process?\u201d said Miller Flowers, with the Young Center.\n\nJennifer Podkul, chief of global policy at Kids in Need of Defense, said some officers lack language skills, trauma-informed interviewing techniques and knowledge of the reunification process.\n\n\u201cIt seems like it\u2019s designed just to cast the net wider on immigration enforcement against adults,\u201d she said.\n\nString of policy changes adding hurdles to reunification process\n\nThe July changes are among the steps the Trump administration has taken to ramp up vetting of parents seeking to reunite with children.\n\nThe administration has required fingerprinting from sponsors and any adults living in the home where children are released. It has also required identification or proof of income that only those legally present in the U.S. could acquire, as well as introducing DNA testing and home visits by immigration officers.\n\nChildren have been spending more time in government-run shelters under increased vetting. The average length of stay for those released was 171 days in July, down from a peak of 217 days in April but well above 37 days in January, when Trump took office.\n\nAbout 2,000 unaccompanied children were in government custody in July.\n\nShaina Aber, an executive director of the Acacia Center for Justice analyzing child custody data, attributes the longer custody times to the policy changes.\n\n\u201cThe agency\u2019s mission has been conflated and entangled,\u201d she added. \u201cIt seems ORR\u2019s mission has been somewhat compromised in that they are now doing more on the immigration enforcement side, and they\u2019re not an immigration enforcement entity.\u201d\n\nGonzalez writes for the Associated Press.",

      "text": "South Koreans are obsessed with Netflix\u2019s \u2018K-pop Demon Hunters.\u2019 Here\u2019s why\n- Share via\nSEOUL \u2014 When South Koreans start to obsess over a movie or TV series, they abbreviate its name, a distinction given to Netflix\u2019s latest hit \u201cK-pop Demon Hunters.\u201d In media headlines and in every corner of the internet, the American-made film is now universally referred to as \u201cKeh-deh-hun\u201d \u2014 the first three syllables of the title when read aloud in Korean.\nAnd audiences are already clamoring for a sequel.\nThe animated film follows a fictional South Korean girl group named \u201cHUNTR/X\u201d as its three members \u2014 Rumi, Mira and Zoey \u2014 try to deliver the world from evil through the power of song and K-pop fandom.\nSince its release in June, it has become the most watched original animated film in Netflix history, with millions of views worldwide, including the U.S. and South Korea, where its soundtrack has topped the charts on local music streaming platform Melon. Fans have also cleaned out the gift shop at the National Museum of Korea, which has run out of a traditional tiger pin that resembles one of the movie\u2019s characters.\nMuch of the film\u2019s popularity in South Korea is rooted in its keenly observed details and references to Korean folklore, pop culture and even national habits \u2014 the result of having a production team filled with K-pop fans, as well as a group research trip to South Korea that co-director Maggie Kang led in order to document details as minute as the appearance of local pavement.\nThere are nods to traditional Korean folk painting, a Korean guide to the afterlife, the progenitors of K-pop and everyday mannerisms. In one scene, at a table in a restaurant where the three girls are eating, viewers might notice how the utensils are laid atop a napkin, an essential ritual for dining out in South Korea \u2014 alongside pouring cups of water for everyone at the table.\n\u201cThe more that I watch \u2018Keh-deh-hun,\u2019 the more that I notice the details,\u201d South Korean music critic Kim Yoon-ha told local media last month. \u201cIt managed to achieve a verisimilitude that would leave any Korean in awe.\u201d\n::\nDespite its subject matter and association with the \u201cK-wave,\u201d that catchall term for any and all Korean cultural exports, \u201cK-pop Demon Hunters,\u201d at least in the narrowest sense, doesn\u2019t quite fit the bill.\nProduced by Sony Pictures and directed by Korean Canadian Kang and Chris Appelhans \u2014 who has held creative roles on other animated films such as \u201cCoraline\u201d and \u201cFantastic Mr. Fox\u201d \u2014 the movie is primarily in English and geared toward non-Korean audiences. But its popularity in South Korea is another sign that the boundaries of the K-wave are increasingly fluid \u2014 and that, with more and more diaspora Korean artists entering the mix, it flows in the opposite direction, too.\nThose barriers have already long since broken down in music: many K-pop artists and songwriters are non-Korean or part of the Korean diaspora, reflecting the genre\u2019s history of foreign influences such as Japanese pop or American hip-hop.\n\u201cOnce a cultural creation acquires a universality, you can\u2019t just confine it to the borders of the country of origin, which is where K-pop is today,\u201d said Kim Il-joong, director of the content business division at the Korea Creative Content Agency, a government body whose mission is to promote South Korean content worldwide. \u201cDespite what the name \u2018K-pop\u2019 suggests, it is really a global product.\u201d\nIn \u201cK-pop Demon Hunters,\u201d Zoey is a rapper from Burbank. In addition, the soundtrack was written and performed by a team that includes producers, artists and choreographers associated with some of the biggest real-life K-pop groups of the past decade.\nStreaming productions are increasingly flying multiple flags, too: Apple TV\u2019s \u201cPachinko\u201d or Netflix\u2019s \u201cXO, Kitty\u201d are both American productions that were filmed in South Korea. But few productions have been able to inspire quite the same level of enthusiasm as \u201cK-pop Demon Hunters,\u201d whose charm for many South Koreans is how accurately it captures local idiosyncrasies and contemporary life.\nWhile flying in their private jet, the three girls are shown sitting on the floor even though there is a sofa right beside them. This tendency to use sofas as little more than backrests is an endless source of humor and self-fascination among South Koreans, most of whom would agree that the centuries-old custom of sitting on the floor dies hard.\nSouth Korean fans and media have noted that the characters correctly pronounce \u201cramyeon,\u201d or Korean instant noodles. The fact that ramyeon is often conflated with Japanese ramen \u2014 which inspired the invention of the former decades ago \u2014 has long been a point of exasperation for many South Koreans and local ramyeon companies, which point to the fact that the Korean adaption has since evolved into something distinct.\nIt\u2019s a small difference \u2014 the Korean version is pronounced \u201crah myun\u201d \u2014 but one that it pays to get right in South Korea.\nThe girls\u2019 cravings for ramyeon during their flight also caught the eye of Ireh, a member of the real-life South Korean girl group Purple Kiss who praised the film\u2019s portrayals of life as a K-pop artist.\n\u201cI don\u2019t normally eat ramyeon, but whenever I go on tour, I end up eating it,\u201d she said in a recent interview with local media. \u201cThe scene reminded me of myself.\u201d\nSouth Korean fans have also been delighted by a pair of animals, Derpy and Sussy, which borrow from jakhodo, a genre of traditional Korean folk painting in which tigers and magpies are depicted side by side, popularized during the Joseon Dynasty in the 19th century.\nIn the film, Derpy is the fluorescent tiger with goggle eyes that always appears with its sidekick, a three-eyed bird named Sussy.\nThough they have long since been extinct, tigers were once a feared presence on the Korean peninsula, at times coming down from the mountains to terrorize the populace. They were also revered as talismans that warded off evil spirits. But much like Derpy itself, jakhodo reimagined tigers as friendlier, oftentimes comical beings. Historians have interpreted this as the era\u2019s political satire: the magpie, audacious in the presence of a great predator, represented the common man standing up to the nobility.\nThe movie is peppered with homages to Korean artists throughout history who are seen today as the progenitors of contemporary K-pop. There are apparent nods to the \u201cJeogori Sisters,\u201d a three-piece outfit that was active from 1939 to 1945 and is often described as Korea\u2019s first girl group, followed by the Kim Sisters, another three-piece that found success in the U.S., performing in Las Vegas and appearing on \u201cThe Ed Sullivan Show.\u201d\nLongtime K-pop fans might recognize the demon hunters from the 1990s as S.E.S., a pioneering girl group formed by S.M. Entertainment, the label behind present-day superstars Aespa and Red Velvet. (Bada, S.E.S.\u2019s main vocalist, recently covered \u201cGolden,\u201d the film\u2019s headline track, on YouTube.)\nFor a long time, South Korean audiences have often complained about outside depictions of the country as inauthentic and out of touch. Not anymore.\n\u201cKorea wasn\u2019t just shown as an extra add-on as it has been for so long,\u201d Kim said. \u201c\u2018K-pop Demon Hunters\u2019 did such a great job depicting Korea in a way that made it instantly recognizable to audiences here.\u201d"

      "text": "As Noem confirms more ICE resources are heading to Chicago, mayor is defying crackdown\n- Share via\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Sunday that immigration operations will soon be expanded in Chicago, confirming plans for a stepped-up presence of federal agents in the nation\u2019s third-largest city as President Trump continues to lash out at Illinois\u2019 Democratic leadership.\nNoem\u2019s comments came a day after Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson struck back against what he called the \u201cout-of-control\u201d plan to surge federal officers into the city. The Chicago Police Department will be barred from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement or any related patrols, traffic stops and checkpoints during the surge, according to an executive order Johnson signed Saturday.\nThe Homeland Security Department last week requested limited logistical support from officials at the Naval Station Great Lakes to support the agency\u2019s anticipated operations. The military installation is about 35 miles north of Chicago.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago ... but we do intend to add more resources to those operations,\u201d Noem said during a Sunday appearance CBS News\u2019 \u201dFace the Nation.\u201d\nNoem declined to provide further details about the planned surge of federal officers. It comes after the Trump administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, saying they were needed to target crime, immigration and homelessness, and two months after it sent troops to Los Angeles.\nTrump lashed out against Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker in a social media posting Saturday, warning him that he must straighten out Chicago\u2019s crime problems quickly \u201cor we\u2019re coming.\u201d The Republican president has also been critical of Johnson.\nJohnson and Pritzker, both Democrats, have denounced the expected federal mobilization, noting that crime has fallen in Chicago. They are planning to sue if Trump moves forward with the plan.\nIn his order signed Saturday, Johnson directed all city departments to guard the constitutional rights of Chicago residents \u201camidst the possibility of imminent militarized immigration or National Guard deployment by the federal government.\u201d\nAsked during a news conference about federal agents who are presumably \u201ctaking orders,\u201d Johnson replied: \u201cYeah, and I don\u2019t take orders from the federal government.\u201d\nJohnson also blocked Chicago police from wearing face coverings to hide their identities, as most federal immigration officers have done since Trump launched his crackdown.\nThe federal surge into Chicago could start as early as Friday and last about 30 days, according to two U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss plans that had not been made public.\nPritzker, in an interview aired Sunday on \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d said that Trump\u2019s expected plans to mobilize federal forces in the city may be part of a plan to \u201cstop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections.\u201d\nNoem said it was a Trump \u201cprerogative\u201d whether to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago as he did in Los Angeles in June in the midst of protests there against immigration raids.\n\u201cI do know that L.A. wouldn\u2019t be standing today if President Trump hadn\u2019t taken action,\u201d Noem said. \u201cThat city would have burned if left to devices of the mayor and governor of that state.\u201d\nUnlike the recent federal takeover of policing in Washington, the Chicago operation is not expected to rely on the National Guard or military and is focused exclusively on immigration, rather than being cast as part of a broad campaign against crime, Trump administration officials have said.\nChicago is home to a large immigrant population, and both the city and the state of Illinois have some of the country\u2019s strongest rules against cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts. That has often put the city and state at odds with the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation agenda.\nJohnson\u2019s order builds on the city\u2019s longtime stance, that neither Chicago nor Illinois officials have sought or been consulted on the federal presence and they stand against Trump\u2019s mobilization plan.\nDuring his news conference Saturday, Johnson accused the president of \u201cbehaving outside the bounds of the Constitution\u201d and seeking a federal presence in Democratic cities as retribution against his political rivals.\n\u201cHe is reckless and out of control,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cHe\u2019s the biggest threat to our democracy that we\u2019ve experienced in the history of our country.\u201d\nIn response, the White House contended that the potential flood of federal agents was about \u201ccracking down on crime.\u201d\n\u201cIf these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticize the President, their communities would be much safer,\u201d White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in an email Saturday.\nCritics have noted that Trump, while espousing a tough-on-crime push, is the only felon ever to occupy the White House.\nMadhani and Beck write for the Associated Press and reported from Washington and Chicago, respectively."
