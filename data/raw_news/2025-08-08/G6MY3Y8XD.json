  "title": "HBO Max's Aggresive Password Sharing Crakdown Set to Begin This September",
  "description": "HBO's campaign against password sharing will take a more aggressive turning beginning September, according to Warner Bros.",
  "content": "HBO Max is set to be more aggressive in its password sharing crackdown efforts beginning next month.\n\nAccording to Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming CEO, JB Perette, users can expect to see more prompts revolving around password sharing. These prompts will encourage the addition of new members to accounts instead of simply sharing their passwords to friends and family.\n\nAs noted by The Verge, adding a new member to an account will cost $7.99 per month. Only one member can be added to an account.\n\nDuring an earnings call, Perrette pointed out that paid sharing is \"a voluntary process.\"\n\n\"In September, you'll actually start to see the messaging \u2014 which right now has been a fairly soft, cancelable messaging \u2014 start to get more fixed and such that people have to take action,\" he said.\n\nHBO Max with ads will cost a user $9.99 per month, and Standard plan that has no ads is priced at $16.99 per month.\n\nThose who are willing to splurge can opt for a Premium plan that offers 4K streaming. This is priced at $20.99 per month.\n\nIs It More Practical to Get Your Own HBO Max Subscription?\n\nA report by Android Authority notes that the $7.99 monthly fee of adding a new member to account is only $2 cheaper than the HBO Max plan with ads.\n\nHowever, there is a factor that may influence people to just opt to be added to an account instead of getting their own.\n\nAs Android Authority has noted in its report, an account's added member is able to share the plan of the main subscriber.\n\nWhat this means is that if the main subscriber has a Premium plan, then the added member also gets to enjoy all the perks of Premium plan by paying the $7.99 fee.",

      "text": "HBO Max\u2019s password-sharing crackdown is about to get stricter. During an earnings call on Thursday, Warner Bros. Discovery streaming head JB Perette said prompts surrounding account sharing will become more persistent starting next month, pushing people toward paying an extra $7.99 per month to add an extra member to their account.\n\u201cIn September, you\u2019ll actually start to see the messaging \u2014 which right now has been a fairly soft, cancelable messaging \u2014 start to get more fixed and such that people have to take action,\u201d Perette said, adding that right now, paid sharing is \u201ca voluntary process.\u201d\nFollowing password-sharing crackdowns at Netflix and Disney Plus, Warner Bros. Discovery announced its own plan to introduce paid sharing last year. So far, HBO Max has introduced \u201csoft messaging\u201d surrounding the change, but it hasn\u2019t begun to strictly enforce the policy.\nThe streamer added 3.4 million subscribers in the months following its debrand from Max to HBO Max, and it will begin driving paid sharing \u201cin a much more aggressive fashion\u201d later this year, according to Perette. HBO Max currently uses account information, IP addresses, device IDs, and user activity to determine if someone is sharing their account with a person outside their household.\nWarner Bros. Discovery execs expect paid sharing to boost subscriber growth, which Netflix reported following its clampdown. But as subscription fatigue continues to grow, making people pay to share their passwords might not go over smoothly with subscribers."

      "text": "Max has officially switched back to HBO Max as part of its rebrand two years after the streaming platform changed its name following the merger between Discovery and Warner Bros.\nThis also comes alongside the announced split between its parent companies, which are going their separate ways soon.\nMax Switches Back to HBO Max After 2 Years\nThe Verge shared that reports yesterday claimed that Max is switching back to HBO Max, and venturing to its previous website of \"Max.com\" will now redirect users to \"HBOMax.com\" instead. This officially marks that the change from its one-word name, which represented Warner Bros. and Discovery's merger, is now back to where it started.\nHBO Max is still the same Max platform featuring dramas and series under HBO Originals, alongside other IPs which are under the brand, centering on movie and TV content.\nIt was also reported that users no longer need to download a new app as their existing application would automatically update to the HBO Max branding in this update.\nRead Also: Canceled 'Batman Arkham' Game Concept Art Leaks Damian Wayne Wearing the Cowl, Villains, and More\nWarner Bros. Splits Up With Discovery\nAccording to The Verge, this follows the recent announcement of Warner Bros. and Discovery's split, with both companies going their separate ways and operating as different entities.\nOne part of the company gets the HBO, movies, and TV studios in this split while the other half receives Discovery Plus, CNN, and other sports and news brands.\nIt remains unknown if HBO Max will still feature the live news and sports content after the split is finalized.\nWarner Bros. Discovery and Max\nThe announcement of Warner Bros. and Discovery's merger two years ago was one of the biggest moves in the media and entertainment industry, but both are known for having separate streaming platforms. It was not long until HBO Max and Discovery Plus also merged into one streaming platform that is set to rival giants in the industry, rebranding both to Max to feature the best of what each has to offer.\nDespite its wide variety of offerings from the renowned HBO Originals to Discovery's renowned STEM offerings, as well as news, live sports, and more, it struggled during its early days. Three months after Max's launch, it saw a 1.8 million decline in its user base as revealed in the first quarterly report of the merged companies despite restructuring and laying off 70 employees.\nIn recent times, Warner Bros. Discovery struggled to keep up its numbers in many aspects of the business, including its films and series, but more importantly, the video gaming developments that included DC, \"Harry Potter,\" and \"Mortal Kombat.\"\nIt led to the company ultimately deciding to split into two entities and go their separate ways, with this also affecting their featured streaming experience.\n\u24d2 2025 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.
