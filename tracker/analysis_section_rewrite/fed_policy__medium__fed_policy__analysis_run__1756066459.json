      "feedback": "Strong draft but needs a formal, 3–6 month catalyst map with explicit triggers, invalidations, and a tight causal chain; fix duplication and align strictly to the two sources (SK994CBWR for ACMR specifics and C22MKA9VY for macro) while avoiding extraneous, non-sourced assertions. Actionable edits: convert into a three-part map (Macro/Policy, Company Catalysts, Flows & Valuation) with timing windows; add precise triggers and invalidations anchored to sources—e.g., Fed path: Sept 50bp cut start, total easing ≥150bp (C22MKA9VY) and the implied flow to capex; ACMR milestones: Ultra C wb/N2 bubbling ramp and 2025 guidance 850–950m (SK994CBWR); international/WFE demand signals and U.S.–China/export-control risk as downside guardrails (SK994CBWR). Include explicit invalidations: if Sept cut fails or tariff momentum reverses, or ACMR misses 2025 guidance, then recast to risk-off. Quantify base-case vs alt paths using stated figures: 850–950m 2025 revenue, 1.4b by 2028, gross margin ~49.4%, net margin ~13.8%, debt/equity ~23.3% (all from SK994CBWR); price targets: current 30.53 vs consensus 34.76 (SK994CBWR) to scaffold a near-term re-rating if the growth/margin trajectory holds. Add a sensitivity layer (macro rate-cut probability, tariff trajectory, export-control developments) to generate 3–6 month price/margin ranges. Sharpen the causal chain: macro loosening boosts capex → WFE demand supports ACMR orders → product ramps lift margins → stock re-prices toward targets; separate a base case, one bullish and one bearish alt with quantitative guardrails. Watch-list signals: Q3/Q4 booking momentum on N2-bubbling tool, trajectory of 2025 guidance, backlog/shipments, and any shift in Fed policy or US–China policy posture. Clean up formatting and remove repeated SK994CBWR blocks; ensure every assertion ties to one of the IDs; assign a concise confidence tag (e.g., moderate) and conclude with a crisp closing sentence tying the map to the horizon.",
