Trump’s administration is moving fast on a bilateral Putin‑Zelensky meeting and is exploring a 10% Intel equity stake to boost domestic chip manufacturing. European leaders emphasized the need for credible military deterrence, while the Fed’s vice‑chair highlighted regulatory priorities and possible rate cuts. The show also touched on tariff revenue, consumer costs, and the broader U.S.–China tech competition.",
