  "title": "The Toyota SUV That Outsells Lexus\u2019 Entire Lineup",
  "description": "It\u2019s practical, reliable, and loved by millions, no wonder it\u2019s crushing luxury brands in sales.",
  "content": "This SUV isn\u2019t just popular, it\u2019s a sales phenomenon. Year after year, it dominates its segment, moving more units than some brands sell across their entire lineup. Its appeal comes from a winning mix of practicality, reliability, and value that resonates with an incredibly broad range of buyers.\n\nFrom daily commuting to weekend road trips, it delivers the versatility drivers need. A comfortable cabin, generous cargo space, and a choice of efficient powertrains make it easy to tailor to different lifestyles. Toyota\u2019s reputation for durability only adds to its long-term appeal, keeping resale values high.\n\nWhile luxury SUVs might offer flashier features or higher performance, few vehicles can match this model\u2019s all-around competence and mass-market success. It\u2019s the rare kind of car that\u2019s as common in suburban driveways as it is on rugged trails, and that\u2019s exactly why it continues to outsell entire luxury lineups.\n\nToyota's RAV4 is the Best-Selling SUV in the United States\n\nThere is no denying the popularity of the Lexus brand, with most of their vehicles offering affordable alternatives to other luxury options while delivering the same level of comfort. However, a single Toyota model manages to outsell the entirety of the Lexus brand, taking its place as the best-selling SUV in the United States multiple years in a row.\n\nIn the luxury space, Lexus is easily one of the biggest players. They outsell their rivals by quite a large margin. The Lexus RX and the NX take first and second, respectively, when it comes to the best-selling luxury vehicles. Despite having quite a large lead over the rest of its competition, the Toyota RAV4 manages to outsell the entirety of Lexus' lineup combined.\n\nToyota has found a recipe that is so successful that few of its rivals manage to even compete. It has held the spot as the best-selling SUV in the United States since 2017. Last year it even managed to dethrone the Ford F-150 to become the best-selling vehicle in the country. The only other SUV that manages to come close is Honda's CR-V, which is still tens of thousands behind the RAV4. This is despite Toyota seeing a 3.6 percent decrease in sales compared to last year.\n\nThe Toyota RAV4 comes in a number of different forms, with there being a gas-only, a hybrid, and a plug-in hybrid on offer. This diversity helps make the RAV4 one of the most versatile nameplates out there, catering to a number of different buyers. A total of 111,526 RAV4s sold so far in 2025 were hybrids and 17,074 were plug-in hybrids. This means that half of all RAV4 sales in 2025 so far come from electrified models.\n\nWe think that the plug-in hybrid model is a bit niche, hence why it has the lowest sales, and that the regular hybrid is the best value version of the crossover. We also think that the XLE Premium trim is the trim of choice, whether you go with the gas-only model or the hybrid, offering fantastic features like faux-leather upholstery, keyless entry, a moonroof, and blind-spot monitoring, among other things.\n\nAs mentioned above, the RAV4 has actually seen a decline in sales compared to last year. This is likely because it is getting a little long in the tooth, with other compact crossovers feeling a little bit more modern. However, Toyota unveiled their 2026 model, going all in on hybrid power. It comes with a ton of interior and exterior upgrades that Toyota hopes will only increase its popularity.\n\nThe RAV4 is Sturdy, Comfortable, and Exceptionally Efficient in Any Form\n\nToyota has built the RAV4 on a reputation for reliability and simplicity. It is meant to be a vehicle that you get into every morning and start without issues, taking you from point A to point B without any fuss. While it might be a little dull, its consistency is a part of what makes it so successful. Its like going to McDonalds, you know the Big Mac is going to be the same every time, which is what makes it good.\n\nUnder the hood of every RAV4 is a proven four-cylinder engine that is known for its reliability. The hybrid model adds three electric motors to the mix, with the plug-in hybrid getting more powerful versions of the electric motors. The gas-only model gets a standard eight-speed automatic while the hybrids get a CVT instead. All-wheel drive is optional on the gas model and standard in the hybrids.\n\nNo matter which model you choose, the RAV4 is never going to feel sporty. It may be pretty quick off the line in hybrid or plug-in hybrid guise, but the handling and ride are exceptionally soft. This does mean that while the Toyota isn't particularly exciting, it is very comfortable. The crossover doesn't try to be anything that its not, it is simple and comfortable transportation, and we respect that.\n\nIf you're running on gas power, the hybrid is the most efficient model. A crossover of this size coming close to breaking 40 miles per gallon combined is exceptional to say the least. The gas-only model isn't bad either, sitting near the top of its class. When you're not running on electric power, the plug-in hybrid is also impressively efficient, sticking close to the figures achieved by the regular hybrid.\n\nThe PHEV also comes equipped with an 18.1-kWh battery pack, allowing for a total of 42 miles of all-electric range. That means it offers more electric range than most PHEVs on the market. When plugged into a 240-volt outlet, Toyota says the battery will fully charge in as little as two and a half hours.\n\nA big part of the success of the RAV4 is that Toyota includes so many advanced safety and driver assist features in the crossover as standard. Many of them form a part of Toyota's Safety Sense 2.5 package. Things like collision detection and avoidance systems and advanced radar cruise control are all standard features. Parking assist and the 360-degree camera are the main non-standard features available.\n\nThe RAV4 also performs exceptionally in crash and safety testing. The NHTSA has given the crossover five stars out of five for safety.\n\nToyota's RAV4 Is Comfortable, Practical, and Loaded With Features\n\nToyota is all about value for money, and this is a big reason why the RAV4 sells so well. While it doesn't try and be fancy nor sporty on the inside, it is an easy-to-use SUV that offers tons of space on the inside. Some may look at the RAV4 and feel that it is a little mundane, but that commonality is why it performs so well. The average car buyer wants something simple and easy to use.\n\nToyota finds the perfect sweet spot when it comes to space in the front seats, rear seats, and cargo hold. Those at the helm are treated best, with plenty of space to stretch out. If you find yourself in the backseat, you still have enough legroom to be comfortable on long journeys. The slightly smaller rear quarters means that the RAV4 can offer you more space in the cargo hold than most of its rivals. Fold the rear seats down, and you can increase cargo space to 69.8 cubic feet.\n\nAs mentioned a couple of times, the RAV4 doesn't try and be flashy, even in its most expensive trims. It focuses on practicality, something that the average buyer values quite highly. This doesn't mean that it skimps on features, though. Faux-leather upholstery is available, as is a six-way power-adjustable driver's seat, heating and ventilation in the front seats, dual-zone climate control, and ambient interior lighting.\n\nIf you go for the LE or the XLE trims, then you get the standard eight-inch infotainment screen, which rises up above the dashboard. Every other trim benefits from a larger 10.5-inch unit instead. Things like a 4G mobile hotspot and wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are on offer. Top trims also come with a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster.\n\nThere are multiple USB and USB-C ports available the cabin, and you can also equip your RAV4 with a wireless smartphone charging pad. A digital rearview mirror is also among the options available. Base models come with a pretty wimpy six-speaker sound system, but you can upgrade to a much better 11-speaker JBL system instead.",

      "text": "Like most vehicles, the Toyota RAV4 depreciates once it leaves the dealer's lot; but this SUV has that Toyota halo around it. Whether you already own a RAV4 or are in the market to buy one, here's how the SUV holds onto its value after five years.\nOne of the primary reasons the Toyota RAV4 was the best-selling SUV in America in 2024 is because it offers a mix of ample interior space, modern in-cabin tech, and abundant standard safety features. In addition to Toyota's reputation for reliability, it's little wonder that 475,193 units were sold last year.\nThis article is focused on the internal-combustion-engine, non-hybrid 2020 Toyota RAV4. If you're seeking to eke out every possible mpg, the RAV4 Hybrid and RAV4 plug-in hybrid are also excellent do-it-all SUVs.\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from Toyota and other authoritative sources, including Edmunds, J.D. Power, and Kelley Blue Book.\nThe Toyota RAV4 Loses On Average $7,259 In Depreciation In Five Years\nIn the mid-1990s, the original Toyota RAV4 pioneered the small, car-based SUV segment and has since continued to set a high standard for the class with each subsequent generation. Redesigned for 2019, the current generation brought with it new proportions and a more rugged appearance, making it a firm favorite, particularly in the U.S.\nWhile owning a vehicle will cause you to lose money over time, whether due to depreciation or other ownership costs, running the numbers can determine just how much value your vehicle will lose on a year-by-year basis. Depending on the make and model, a vehicle can lose up to 40 percent of its value within the first year of ownership.\nThe Toyota RAV4 Loses On Average 22 Percent Of Its Value In Five Years\nHowever, Toyota models typically don't see depreciation above 15 percent in the first year, making them an ideal choice for vehicles that retain their value. The RAV4 depreciated by an average of 22 percent over a five-year period, underscoring the SUV's reputation as a cost-effective and reliable option.\nThe Toyota RAV4's depreciation varies across its trim levels. Over a five-year period, the Limited trim experienced the highest depreciation, losing $9,044 in value against its original MSRP. The XLE Premium follows behind, with a depreciation of $7,743 against MSRP, reflecting the second-highest loss in value among trims.\nFive-Year Depreciation Across Toyota RAV4 Trims\nTo help paint a clearer picture, take a look at this five-year depreciation breakdown across RAV4 trims. The figures are based on the Kelley Blue Book Fair Purchase Price and reflect what buyers currently pay for used 2020 Toyota RAV4 models in typical condition when purchasing from a dealership.\n|\nOriginal MSRP |\nKBB Fair Purchase Price (National Average) |\nFive-Year Depreciation |\n||\n|\nLE Sport Utility 4D |\n$28,525 |\n$21,278 |\n$7,247 |\n|\n|\nXLE Sport Utility 4D |\n$29,820 |\n$23,290 |\n$6,530 |\n|\n|\nXLE Premium Sport Utility 4D |\n$32,525 |\n$24,782 |\n$7,743 |\n|\n|\nAdventure Sport Utility 4D |\n$34,230 |\n$26,689 |\n$7,541 |\n|\n|\nTRD Off-Road Sport Utility 4D |\n$36,455 |\n$31,004 |\n$5,451 |\n|\n|\nLimited Sport Utility 4D |\n$37,055 |\n$28,011 |\n$9,044 |\nThe range-topping TRD Off-Road trim experienced the least depreciation ($5,451 against MSRP), making it a strong choice for value retention. But if you're turning to the used market, the XLE Premium trim is a good choice\u2014but more on that later.\nReliability And Practicality Help The Toyota RAV4 Maintain Its Value\nThe 2020 Toyota RAV4 was an early entry in its generation, as the lineup was redesigned for the 2019 model year. With a couple of years under its belt, the RAV4 has proven itself to be fully reliable and incredibly practical.\nCarrying luggage, equipment, kids, and pets in tow has never been easier for families, thanks to the latest generation's spacious interior, large hatch, and roof racks. While Toyota has focused more on reliability than being at the forefront of tech, the RAV4's infotainment system offers the essentials, including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, ensuring it easily meets the needs of modern drivers.\nAverage Reliability Scores for the 2020 Toyota RAV4\nAs a rough indication only, we also checked in with J.D. Power and Kelley Blue Book to find out the RAV4's reliability scores. Overall, the scores, primarily user-generated, are positive.\n- J.D. Power rates the 2020 RAV4 as 'Average' for reliability with 77/100\u2014its overall consumer rating is 78/100\n- Kelley Blue Book gives the 2020 RAV4 a 3.6/5 consumer rating and a 3.9/5 reliability score\nA Look At The 2020 Toyota RAV4 Specs\nThe 2020 Toyota RAV4 came with only one engine choice: a 2.5-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine rated at 203 horsepower and 184 lb-ft of torque. The engine's output is handled by an efficient eight-speed CVT automatic transmission, helping the RAV4 attain 26 mpg city and 35 mpg highway.\nWhat drivetrain is available in the RAV4 depends on your chosen trim level. The LE trim level comes in front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive options. The next trim level, the XLE, also has both FWD and AWD options, as does the XLE Premium. Both the Adventure and TRD Off-Road come in only AWD. Lastly, the Limited is available in both FWD and AWD.\nToyota RAV4 Trim Features\nLE Features:\n- Multi-LED headlights with automatic high beams\n- LED daytime running lights, headlights, and taillights\n- Power outside mirrors\n- Integrated backup camera\n- Five-passenger seating with fabric-trimmed seats\nXLE Features:\n- Automatic on/off multi-LED headlights\n- Integrated fog lights\n- Color-coded heated power outside mirrors\n- Dual-zone automatic climate control system\nXLE Premium Features:\n- Softex-trimmed seating\n- Six-speaker audio system\n- Seven-inch touchscreen\n- Integrated backup camera\n- Power outside mirrors\nAdventure Features:\n- Front center vent flow controls for climate system\n- Integrated panoramic backup camera with dynamic gridlines\n- Audio Plus\n- Eight-inch touchscreen\nTRD Off-Road Features:\n- Multi-terrain select mode\nLimited Features:\n- Heated front seats standard\n- Premium Audio with 11-speaker JBL system\n- Eight-inch touchscreen\nA Plethora Of Safety And Driver Assistance Features\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) awarded the RAV4 a five-star rating. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) named it Top Safety Pick+.\nThe RAV4 lineup boasts an array of standard driver assists. At the point of ordering, buyers could add blind-spot monitoring and rear-cross-traffic alert, which cost extra on the base model.\nKey Safety Features:\n- Standard automated emergency braking with pedestrian detection\n- Standard lane-departure wanting with lane-keeping assist\n- Standard adaptive cruise control\nThe 2020 RAV4 XLE Premium Is The One We'd Choose\n2020 Toyota RAV4 XLE Premium: Basic Specs\n|\nEngine: 2.5-Liter 4-Cylinder Gasoline |\n|\nDrive: FWD / AWD |\n|\nTransmission: Eight-Speed CVT Automatic |\n|\nPower: 203 HP |\n|\nTorque: 184 LB-FT |\n|\nTowing Capacity: 1,500 LBS |\n|\nUsed Value: $24,782 (KBB Fair Purchase Price National Average) |\nThe XLE Premium was a popular trim level for the 2020 Toyota RAV4 in the U.S. We'd still recommend it if you're buying used, as it offers a great balance of features and value for money.\nFeatures Of The XLE Premium\nThe 2020 RAV4's XLE Premium trim level comes standard with an integrated backup camera, color-coded power outside mirrors, and dual-zone automatic climate control. Unlike the LE and XLE trim levels, the XLE Premium offers Softex-trimmed seating as standard.\nIf you're a fan of listening to your favorite songs when you're hitting the open road, the next bit will be music to your ears\u2014pardon the pun. The XLE Premium comes with a six-speaker audio system and a seven-inch touchscreen."

      "text": "In 2024, Toyota did the unthinkable\u2014its RAV4 outsold the Ford F-150, breaking a four-decade streak. That\u2019s a seismic shift in the automotive world, and Toyota clearly isn\u2019t slowing down.\nFor 2026, the RAV4 gets a major overhaul. Nearly everything has been upgraded, even if the exterior changes are subtle. Most notably, the entire lineup is now hybrid-only\u2014a bold move that reinforces Toyota\u2019s commitment to efficiency and innovation.\nThe updates don\u2019t stop there. Two new versions of the off-road-inspired Woodland model join the mix, and the all-new GR RAV4 brings legit performance upgrades, not just cosmetic tweaks. Toyota\u2019s message is clear: the RAV4 isn\u2019t just a bestseller\u2014it\u2019s aiming to lead in every category.\nWhile full details are still under wraps and will roll out in the coming weeks, one thing\u2019s clear\u2014Toyota took a proven winner and seriously leveled it up. Trust us, the RAV4 just got a whole lot better.\nRAV4 Goes All-in on Hybrid Power\nEvery 2026 RAV4 is now a hybrid\u2014either a traditional setup or a plug-in (PHEV). That\u2019s a major shift, and we expect fuel economy to at least match the impressive numbers from the 2025 models.\nToyota also shook up the lineup itself. The off-road-ready Woodland and sporty GR RAV4 are new additions, and even the base front-wheel-drive version now gets hybrid power.\nThat\u2019s huge for budget-conscious drivers, since it means the most affordable RAV4 should also be one of the most efficient. With the 2025 AWD hybrid already hitting 39 MPG combined, the new FWD hybrid could do even better.\nTo top it off, Toyota\u2019s making a wide range of options available across the board. So whether you\u2019re after performance, efficiency, or value\u2014you\u2019ve got choices.\nPower Boost Across the Board\nHere\u2019s the headline: every 2026 RAV4 is getting a serious power bump. Even the base LE FWD hybrid sees a 23-horsepower increase over last year, which should make a noticeable difference in everyday driving.\nThanks to the hybrid setup, off-the-line acceleration should feel snappier too\u2014electric motors bring instant torque, something gas engines just can\u2019t match. That means quicker getaways and smoother passing power.\nAll-wheel-drive hybrids now pump out 236 horsepower, up from 219. And if you\u2019re eyeing the plug-in hybrid, get ready: it now delivers a beefy 320 horsepower, an 18-horse gain that makes it the most powerful RAV4 yet.\n2026 Toyota RAV4 Trims and Power Output\n|\nCore Design |\nRugged Design |\nSport Design |\n|\nLE, XLE: FWD/AWD Limited: AWD |\nWoodland: AWD |\nSE, XSE, FWD/AWD Hybrid Powertrain XSE, GR-Sport: AWD, PHEV |\n|\n2.5-Liter Hybrid |\n2.5-Liter Hybrid or PHEV |\nSE/XSE: 2.5-Liter Hybrid or PHEV SE/XSE GR-Sport, PHEV |\n|\nFWD: 226 HP AWD: 236 HP |\nAWD Hybrid: 236 HP AWD PHEV: 320 HP |\nFWD: 226 HP AWD: 236 HP AWD PHEV: 320 HP |\nMeet the Performance-Ready GR Sport RAV4\nIf you\u2019ve seen the spicier RAV4 in Europe, get ready\u2014Toyota\u2019s bringing that heat to the U.S. And luckily, it\u2019s not just about looking sharp.\nSure, you\u2019ll get some slick spoilers, sporty skirting, and a cabin decked out with perforated Ultrasuede seats, GR logos, and aluminum pedals. But under the surface, Toyota\u2019s really tightened up the chassis for a more connected drive.\nThis all starts with the sixth-gen RAV4\u2019s stiffer platform, beefed up with stronger frame mounts and glued together with tougher methods. Then, Toyota tapped the Gazoo Racing team\u2014the same crew behind the wild GR Corolla\u2014to make sure this RAV4 isn\u2019t just sporty, but seriously fun to drive.\nToyota kept the details on the GR RAV4 a bit mysterious, but if the European version is any hint, expect stiffer springs and upgraded dampers all around. They\u2019ve also tweaked the steering, which probably means the handling feels tighter and more responsive.\nTo top it off, the GR rolls on 20-inch wheels wrapped in grippier tires\u2014perfect for those who want a sportier, more planted ride.\nThe Adventurous Woodland Edition\nToyota just introduced the bZ Woodland EV, but if you\u2019re not quite ready to go fully electric, they\u2019ve got you covered with two new Woodland RAV4 versions\u2014both hybrid and plug-in hybrid. Unlike before, these 2026 models bring a tougher look with blacked-out grilles and built-in Rigid Industries LED lighting.\nThis isn\u2019t a full-on TRD treatment like the Tacoma gets, so the rugged upgrades are more subtle. The only real lift comes from all-terrain tires adding about half an inch of height, pushing ground clearance to around 9 inches\u2014not bad, but not beast mode either.\nThe Woodland comes standard with AWD and roof rails, plus the hybrid powertrain delivers instant torque\u2014great for off-road bursts. And towing jumps up big time, doubling from 1,750 to 3,500 pounds, making it a solid choice for adventure seekers.\nPHEV: Your Hybrid Bridge to Full EV\nToyota is now estimating up to 50 miles of electric-only range for the RAV4 PHEVs, up from 42 miles in the previous model. Plus, some versions get DC fast charging, letting you jump from 10 percent to 80 percent battery in about 30 minutes.\nIf you\u2019re new to plug-in hybrids, don\u2019t worry\u2014overnight charging with a regular wall outlet works just fine. But if you want to speed things up, Toyota has boosted AC home charging to 11 kW, meaning Level 2 charging will top off your battery quicker than before.\nHow-To Geek's Take\nToyota didn\u2019t add Tesla-compatible NACS ports to the RAV4 PHEVs, sticking with the J1772 on some trims and CCS fast-charging ports on the XSE and Woodland models. You can still charge publicly, but with more stations moving to NACS, Toyota will likely offer adapters or update future models.\nThat\u2019s a small hiccup compared to what really matters: the upgraded digital cabin. Toyota promises a cleaner, more intuitive interface with always-on climate controls and a handy back button to keep navigation simple and distraction-free.\nWe\u2019ll have to test it out to see how it feels in action, but one thing\u2019s clear\u2014the 2026 RAV4 isn\u2019t just a refresh, it\u2019s a serious step forward for Toyota and the millions of buyers who\u2019ll drive these hybrids home."

Here\u2019s our list of the top ten compact SUVs that deliver maximum value in today\u2019s competitive market.\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturer websites and other authoritative sources, including the EPA. Models are ranked based on their starting MSRP, from most affordable to least affordable.\n10 2025 Hyundai Tucson\nMSRP: $28,705 - $47,440\nThe Tucson is a well-rounded compact SUV. It may not be at the top of its segment in any individual area, but it checks all the right boxes. It looks great, features a ton of tech, and has one of the most spacious cabins of any option in its class. As well as the gas-only base model, Hyundai also offers a hybrid and plug-in hybrid.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.5-Liter Inline-Four |\n1.6-Liter Turbo Hybrid Inline-Four |\n1.6-Liter Turbo PHEV Inline-Four |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|\nTransmission |\n8-Speed Automatic |\n6-Speed Automatic |\n6-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n187 HP |\n231 HP |\n268 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n178 LB-FT |\n258 LB-FT |\n258 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nFWD or AWD |\nAWD |\nAWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n8.8 Seconds |\n7.2 Seconds |\n7.2 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n120 MPH |\n115 MPH |\n122 MPH |\nThere are three powertrains to choose from in the 2025 Hyundai Tucson. If you need more grunt than the gas-only model can offer, then both hybrids are good options. Regardless of which powertrain you opt for, the Tucson is impressively smooth and features a more comfortable ride than you'd expect.\n9 2026 Kia Sportage\nMSRP: $28,690 - $44,390\nFollowing the Tucson closely is its Korean cousin from Kia, the Sportage. It also manages to be a jack-of-all-trades, delivering a comfortable interior and a slew of standard features. It does also rely on more striking exterior styling to stand out. While not explicitly exciting, it'll satisfy anyone aiming for comfort and affordability.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.5-Liter Inline-Four |\n1.6-Liter Turbo Hybrid Inline-Four |\n1.6-Liter Turbo PHEV Inline-Four |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|\nTransmission |\n8-Speed Automatic |\n6-Speed Automatic |\n6-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n187 HP |\n227 HP |\n261 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n178 LB-FT |\n258 LB-FT |\n258 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nFWD or AWD |\nAWD |\nAWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n9.1 Seconds |\n7.4 Seconds |\n6.9 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n120 MPH |\n124 MPH |\n119 MPH |\nWhile the Tucson and the Sportage offer similar powertrain setups, there are some slight differences in performance. Overall, the Sportage is a little slower getting up to 60 miles per hour, but not by a huge margin. It may not be super engaging, but it delivers a plush driving experience. The X-Pro trims also tack on some genuine off-roading equiment.\n8 2025 Mazda CX-5\nMSRP: $28,770 - $40,800\nWhen Mazda introduced the slightly larger and more expensive CX-50, the expectation was that the aging CX-5 would start to be phased out. However, no matter where you are in the world, the CX-5 remains Mazda's most popular vehicle. Looking at how comfortable, stylish, and fun it is, this isn't a huge surprise.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.5-Liter Inline-Four |\n2.5-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n|---|---|---|\n|\nTransmission |\n6-Speed Automatic |\n6-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n187 HP |\n250 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n186 LB-FT |\n320 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nAWD |\nAWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n8.1 Seconds |\n6.2 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n126 MPH |\n129 MPH |\nWhile not the quickest, a CX-5 with its base engine still feels reasonably perky. If you're a driving enthusiast, though, you'll want to upgrade to a turbocharged model. The CX-5 is one of the most perfectly balanced crossovers out there, with a ride quality better than most of the options in this segment and sporty driving dynamics that are hard to find anywhere else.\n7 2025 Toyota RAV4\nMSRP: $29,550 - $48,435\nIf you're looking for a crossover with proven reliability, great after-sales support, and a great list of standard kit, it's hard to argue against the RAV4. While it may not be as adventurous as it once was, this Japanese crossover remains the most popular crossover in the U.S. market, a position it has held for a number of years.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.5-Liter Inline-Four |\n2.5-Liter Hybrid Inline-Four |\n2.5-Liter PHEV Inline-Four |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|\nTransmission |\n8-Speed Automatic |\nCVT |\nCVT |\n|\nHorsepower |\n203 HP |\n219 HP |\n302 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n184 LB-FT |\n163 LB-FT |\n165 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nFWD or AWD |\nAWD |\nAWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n8.3 Seconds |\n7.3 Seconds |\n5.4 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n119 MPH |\n115 MPH |\n117 MPH |\nYou can choose a gas-only, hybrid, or plug-in hybrid powertrain in the RAV4. Toyota's biggest downfall in their compact crossover is that it isn't all that engaging, with floaty steering and dull handling dynamics. It is, however, fairly comfortable, and the plug-in hybrid model can't be accused of being slow.\n6 2026 Chevrolet Equinox\nMSRP: $29,995 - $46,090\nChevrolet has redesigned their Equinox for the 2025 model year, giving it a much more rugged-looking exterior and a more tech-laden cabin. It now feels like it has the chops to better compete with other options in this segment. If the gas model doesn't appeal to you, Chevy also offers an electric model, being one of the most affordable new electric SUVs on the market.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n1.5-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\nElectric Motor |\n|---|---|---|\n|\nTransmission |\nCVT or 8-Speed Automatic |\nN/A |\n|\nHorsepower |\n175 HP |\n213\u2013288 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n184 LB-FT |\n236\u2013333 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nFWD or AWD |\nFWD or AWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n8.6 Seconds |\n5.8-7.7 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n125 MPH |\n112-113 MPH |\nGas-powered Equinoxs feature a turbocharged four-cylinder engine. Front-wheel drive is standard and all-wheel drive is optional. Front-wheel models get a CVT while all-wheel models get a traditional automatic. Electric models are much quicker and come with either a single motor on the front axle or two motors and all-wheel drive.\n5 2025 Mitsubishi Outlander\nMSRP: $29,995 - $50,445\nMitsubishi isn't quite what it used to be, particularly in the United States. However, the Outlander remains a stand-out option that offers pretty exceptional value for money. Like many of the other compact SUVs on this list, it puts interior comfort and space over enthusiastic driving dynamics. What is unique about the Outlander is that it can be had with a third row of seats.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.5-Liter Inline-Four |\n2.4-Liter PHEV Inline-Four |\n|---|---|---|\n|\nTransmission |\nCVT |\n1-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n181 HP |\n248 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n181 LB-FT |\n332 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nFWD or AWD |\nAWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n8.5 Seconds |\n6.6 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n120 MPH |\n110 MPH |\nWhether you get the gas-only or the plug-in hybrid Outlander, you'll find its driving dynamics fairly dull. This is because it puts comfort first, delivering good body control and a compliant ride. The PHEV is perkier off the line and also delivers pretty decent all-electric driving range.\n4 2025 Volkswagen Tiguan\nMSRP: $30,245 - $40,505\nWhile not always the most popular choice, the Tiguan has consistently been a good-value option in the compact SUV segment. It has now entered its third generation for the 2025 model year, with a more refined interior, sleeker exterior styling, and a more powerful engine. Though, they have gotten rid of the option of a third row.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.0-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n|---|---|\n|\nTransmission |\n8-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n201 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n221 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nFWD or AWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n7.7 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n114 MPH |\nWith power being bumper, up from 184 in last year's model, the Tiguan is now even quicker off the line. Volkswagen has also managed to find some weight to shed, which adds to the perkiness of the crossover. It is smooth and comfortable, but its most impressive trait is its engaging handling.\n3 2025 Mazda CX-50\nMSRP: $30,500 - $43,500\nThe Mazda CX-50 is one of the best value-for-money compact SUVs you can buy. It checks every box for just about every buyer. Not only does it look fantastic, both on the outside and the inside, but it is packed with high-quality materials and delivers driving dynamics that are essentially unmatched in this segment.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.5-Liter Inline-Four |\n2.5-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n2.5-Liter Hybrid Inline-Four |\n|---|---|---|---|\n|\nTransmission |\n6-Speed Automatic |\n6-Speed Automatic |\nCVT |\n|\nHorsepower |\n187 HP |\n250 HP |\n219 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n185 LB-FT |\n320 LB-FT |\n163 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nAWD |\nAWD |\nAWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n8.5 Seconds |\n6.4 Seconds |\n7.6 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n118 MPH |\n142 MPH |\n117 MPH |\nThere are three setups to choose from when picking your CX-50. There are two gas-only options, one turbocharged and the other not, and a hybrid. We'd recommend sticking with the gas-only CX-50 unless you really need the additional efficiency. The hybrid borrows its powertrain and transmission from the Toyota RAV4 hybrid and it doesn't live up to the Mazda's lively chassis.\n2 2026 Honda CR-V\nMSRP: $30,920 - $42,250\nThe CR-V is one of the most popular vehicles on the road, coming close to the sales numbers of the Toyota RAV4. In our opinion, it does everything that the RAV4 does but better. If you're looking for something simple, affordable, and spacious that will get you around without any complaints, the CR-V is one of your best options. Honda is also including a new off-roading Trailsport model for 2026.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n1.5-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n2.0-Liter Hybrid Inline-Four |\n|---|---|---|\n|\nTransmission |\nCVT |\nCVT |\n|\nHorsepower |\n190 HP |\n204 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n179 LB-FT |\n138 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nFWD or AWD |\nFWD or AWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n8.1 Seconds |\n7.9 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n130 MPH |\n111 MPH |\nThe CR-V may not be the quickest nor the most agile, but it features a solid engine, regardless of whether you opt for the gas-only model or the hybrid. It may not be as exciting to drive as some of its rivals, but it does have enough character to keep you entertained during your daily commutes.\n1 2025 Ford Bronco Sport\nStarting MSRP: $30,995 - $40,115\nIt isn't as large or as capable as its mid-size sibling, the Bronco, but the Bronco Sport is a unique option that is better equipped to conquer uneven terrain than most of the options in the compact SUV segment. Alongside its unique styling and capabilities, it is also impressively practical and reliable.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n1.5-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Three |\n2.0-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n|---|---|---|\n|\nTransmission |\n8-Speed Automatic |\n8-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n181 HP |\n250 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n190 LB-FT |\n277 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\n4WD |\n4WD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n8.1 Seconds |\n5.9 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n118 MPH |\n125 MPH |\nBase Bronco Sports come with a turbocharged three-cylinder engine, but top trims can get a turbocharged four-cylinder instead. The latter also comes with wheel-mounted paddle-shifters. The most capable models also come with a plethora of off-road equipment, including a twin-clutch rear-drive unit and a differential lock."

      "text": "SUVs continue to lead the charge in 2025, and some models are pulling far ahead of the competition. These top-selling SUVs are winning over buyers with the right mix of features, value, and versatility.\nWhether it\u2019s family-friendly practicality, fuel efficiency, or rugged all-terrain performance, today\u2019s best-sellers reflect what shoppers care about most. Automakers that nail the formula are being rewarded with strong numbers early in the year.\nFrom budget-friendly compacts to high-tech three-row models, these SUVs are setting the pace in one of the most competitive segments in the market. Here\u2019s a look at which ones are dominating the charts in 2025 so far.\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturer websites and other authoritative sources, including the EPA. Models are ranked based on units sold so far in 2025, from least to most.\n10 2025 Subaru Crosstrek\nUnits Sold This Year: 90,334\nSubaru's subcompact crossover, the Crosstrek, is their second best-selling model so far for 2025, a position is continues to hold on to. If you're looking for an affordable adventure vehicle that offers some genuine off-road chops, this is it. Compared to sales in 2024, the 2025 Crosstrek is up 14 percent.\nTrims and Pricing\n|\nModel |\nStarting MSRP |\n|---|---|\n|\nBase |\n$26,560 |\n|\nPremium |\n$27,810 |\n|\nSport |\n$30,360 |\n|\nLimited |\n$32,260 |\n|\nWilderness |\n$33,360 |\nThe Crosstrek's starting price is about average for the segment, but it offers you quite a lot for your money. Of the trims on offer, we think that the Premium and the Wilderness offer you the best bang-for-your-buck. The Premium comes with more power and an upgraded infotainment system, while the Wilderness delivers some real out-of-the-box capability.\n9 2025 Subaru Forester\nUnits Sold This Year: 95,972\nWhile it may not look it, the Forester is completely new for the 2025 model year, with updated styling and a more modern interior. This has helped the compact SUV keep its sales up. While the growth in sales took a bit of a hit in the second quarter, the Forester's yearly sales are still up by three percent.\nTrims and Pricing\n|\nModel |\nStarting MSRP |\n|---|---|\n|\nBase |\n$29,995 |\n|\nPremium |\n$33,385 |\n|\nSport |\n$36,105 |\n|\nWilderness |\n$36,285 |\n|\nLimited |\n$37,695 |\n|\nTouring |\n$41,595 |\nOnce again, starting prices for the Subaru are about average for the segment, hovering around the $30,000 mark. It comes with either a gas-only or hybrid powertrain, with the hybrid being available on every trim besides the Base and Wilderness. We think that the Sport does the best job of balancing price and features.\n8 2025 Jeep Grand Cherokee\nUnits Sold This Year: 99,668\nThe Jeep Grand Cherokee comes in a number of forms in 2025, with the American brand offering a three-row version, the L, and a plug-in hybrid, the 4xe, over the base model. It continues to be Jeep's bestseller, but it has seen a slight slump, with sales dropping seven percent compared to last year.\nTrims and Pricing\n|\nModel |\nStarting MSRP |\n|---|---|\n|\nLaredo A |\n$36,495 |\n|\nLaredo |\n$37,035 |\n|\nLaredo X |\n$37,785 |\n|\nAltitude |\n$41,640 |\n|\nAltitude X |\n$42,140 |\n|\nLimited |\n$42,905 |\n|\nOverland |\n$56,995 |\n|\nSummit |\n$58,560 |\n|\nSummit Reserve |\n$63,040 |\nThe Grand Cherokee starts on the more expensive side of the mid-size segment. This is a result of Jeep attempting to move slightly upmarket. We think this strategy pays off in some models, and while its expensive we think the Limited is actually the best representation of the SUV.\n7 2025 Ford Explorer\nUnits Sold This Year: 104,929\nWhile it might not be the flashiest option out there, the Ford Explorer continues to deliver rugged good looks and the option of some brawny powertrains. This three-row midsize SUV remains a favorite among buyers. Sales soared in the second quarter of this year, with a 24 percent increase compared to the same period last year.\nTrims and Pricing\n|\nModel |\nStarting MSRP |\n|---|---|\n|\nActive |\n$40,050 |\n|\nST-Line |\n$45,020 |\n|\nPlatinum |\n$53,525 |\n|\nST |\n$54,770 |\nCompared to some other midsize three-row SUVs, the Ford Explorer has a slightly higher starting price. Ford has trimmed the lineup for the 2025 model, getting rid of the mid-level Limited. In its place, we think that the sporty-looking ST-Line offers exceptional value. We wouldn't blame you for upgrading to the turbocharged V-6 in the fully-blown ST though.\n6 2025 Nissan Rogue\nUnits Sold This Year: 109,563\nNissan updated the Rogue for the 2024 model year, and the changes to its styling and interior features seem to have boosted the compact SUV's popularity. The main change for this year was the addition of an off-roading Rock Creek model. Its sales spike looks like it's starting to teeter off, with the Rogue moving from the tenth best-selling vehicle in Q1 to 15th in Q2.\nTrims and Pricing\n|\nModel |\nStarting MSRP |\n|---|---|\n|\nS |\n$28,590 |\n|\nSV |\n$29,590 |\n|\nRock Creek |\n$33,490 |\n|\nSL |\n$35,090 |\n|\nPlatinum |\n$38,590 |\nThe Rogue is one of the more affordable options in the compact SUV segment, though the margin is fairly small. While there is defintiely a case to be made for the Rock Creek trim if you're the adventurous type, we think that the average buyer will find the best value in the SV model, which offers a stack of desirable features for a small jump in price.\n5 2025 Hyundai Tucson\nUnits Sold This Year: 113,310\nThe Tucson may not be the most exciting crossover to drive, but it delivers sharp contemporary styling, a spacious interior, and a plethora of standard features, all at a price that is really hard to argue with. This is why the Tucson is Hyundai's best-seller, and why sales continue to grow, with Q2 figures that are 25 percent higher than last year.\nTrims and Pricing\n|\nModel |\nStarting MSRP |\n|---|---|\n|\nSE |\n$28,705 |\n|\nSEL |\n$30,565 |\n|\nSEL Convenience |\n$33,015 |\n|\nBlue Hybrid |\n$33,465 |\n|\nXRT |\n$33,015 |\n|\nSEL Convenience Hybrid |\n$36,465 |\n|\nN-Line Hybrid |\n$38,215 |\n|\nLimited |\n$38,645 |\n|\nSEL PHEV |\n$39,730 |\n|\nLimited Hybrid |\n$41,295 |\n|\nLimited PHEV |\n$47,440 |\nThe Tucson comes with either a gas-only, hybrid, or plug-in hybrid powertrain. All three models are pretty competitively priced for the segment that they compete in. If you're looking for a gas-only model, we'd suggest the SEL, while we think that the N-Line is the best value hybrid model.\n4 2025 Chevrolet Trax\nUnits Sold This Year: 119,593\nChevrolet has really proven that a good small, affordable crossover can sell better than its larger rivals. The Trax continues and upwards trend of popularity thanks to its phenomenal starting price and impressive list of standard features. Its sales in the first half of 2025 are 32 percent better than last year.\nTrims and Pricing\n|\nModel |\nStarting MSRP |\n|---|---|\n|\nLS |\n$21,895 |\n|\n1RS |\n$23,895 |\n|\nLT |\n$24,095 |\n|\n2RS |\n$25,895 |\n|\nACTIV |\n$25,895 |\nIf you're looking for an affordable crossover, the Trax is among the cheapest options in 2025. It undercuts all of its core rivals in the subcompact SUV segment. While every model offers pretty impressive value for money, the LT strikes the sweet spot. It comes with a bunch of features, including a larger touchscreen and wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n3 2026 Chevrolet Equinox\nUnits Sold This Year: 129,889\nChevrolet makes the list a second time with the compact Equinox. The Equinox entered a new generation for the 2025 model year and sees yearly sales that are 22 percent better than last year. This number doesn't include sales of the Equinox EV, which is fair as it is wildly different to the gas-powered model.\nTrims and Pricing\n|\nModel |\nStarting MSRP |\n|---|---|\n|\nLT |\n$29,995 |\n|\nACTIV |\n$34,395 |\n|\nRS |\n$34,395 |\nThe Equinox starts at a price similar to its rivals in the compact SUV segment. We'd skip the base LT and upgrade to either the ACTIV or the RS. Both come with similar equipment and an identical price tag, it just comes down to whether you prefer the outdoorsy look of the ACTIV or the sporty look of the RS.\n2 2026 Honda CR-V\nUnits Sold This Year: 212,561\nSelling over 80,000 more units than the Equinox, the Honda CR-V stands proud as the fourth best-selling vehicle in the U.S. and the second best-selling SUV. While not particularly exciting, those looking for comfortable and affordable transport will find that the CR-V is easily one of the best-value options on the market. Popularity only continues to grow, with sales in H1 up eight percent from last year.\nTrims and Pricing\n|\nModel |\nStarting MSRP |\n|---|---|\n|\nLX |\n$30,920 |\n|\nEX |\n$33,150 |\n|\nEX-L |\n$35,400 |\n|\nSport Hybrid |\n$35,630 |\n|\nTrailsport Hybrid |\n$38,800 |\n|\nSport-L Hybrid |\n$38,725 |\n|\nSport Touring Hybrid |\n$42,250 |\nIf you're looking to avoid the hybrid model, then the EX-L represents the best version of the CR-V. However, we definitely recommend stepping up, as the hybrid model comes with the best features. The Sport-L offers some excellent value, balancing price and features. We appreciate the addition of an adventurous Trailsport model for 2026 as well, though.\n1 2025 Toyota RAV4\nUnits Sold This Year: 239,451\nToyota continues to hold the top spot when it comes to SUV sales, despite sales having slipped four percent compared to last year. This is likely due in no small part to the fact that Toyota is ramping things down to prepare for the hybrid-only sixth generation model that will launch later this year.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nModel |\nStarting MSRP |\n|---|---|\n|\nLE |\n$29,550 |\n|\nXLE |\n$31,060 |\n|\nHybrid LE |\n$32,600 |\n|\nXLE Premium |\n$33,950 |\n|\nHybrid XLE |\n$34,110 |\n|\nHybrid SE |\n$35,395 |\n|\nHybrid Woodland Edition |\n$35,820 |\n|\nHybrid XLE Premium |\n$37,000 |\n|\nLimited |\n$37,855 |\n|\nHybrid XSE |\n$38,260 |\n|\nHybrid Limited |\n$40,905 |\n|\nPHEV SE |\n$44,565 |\n|\nPHEV XSE |\n$48,435 |\nThere are a number of different models to choose from when it comes to the RAV4. There is a gas, hybrid, and plug-in hybrid variant. While the plug-in hybrid model is nice, we'd stick with either the gas or the hybrid in the XLE Premium trim, which comes with plenty of niceties for the price that you pay."

      "text": "The Ford F-150 has been a dominant force in American auto sales for decades. Its reign has ended, as for the first time in a decade the Toyota RAV4 has claimed the title of the most-registered vehicle in the U.S., according to data from JATO Dynamics.\nBeloved by Americans for decades, the workhorse that is the F-150 now sits in second place\u2014a shift not seen since the Toyota Camry briefly took the crown in 2009. A modest decline in sales, combined with a strong year for the RAV4, was enough to tip the balance in 2024.\nThe Toyota RAV4 Had a Strong Year, But...\nWhile the RAV4 had a strong year, there's a catch. JATO's numbers differ from those of traditional manufacturer-reported sales as they separate the F-150 from the automaker's larger Super Duty truck models. Where Ford typically reports all F-Series trucks under one umbrella, JATO splits them, which results in the RAV4 being ahead by 14,278 units.\nAs expected, Ford has its own take on this tally. Product communications director Mike Levine pointed out that all F-Series trucks\u2014from the F-150 to the F-600\u2014share a common cab structure and powertrain options, in the same way Toyota offers different configurations of the RAV4.\nLooking ahead, upcoming tariffs on vehicles and components from Mexico, Canada, and Japan could significantly impact pricing and sales rankings in 2025.\nThe ranking shake-up doesn't end there, though, as the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 has dropped to fifth place, the GMC Sierra has slipped to tenth place, and the RAM 1500 has fallen out of the top ten entirely. There's good news for GM: the Chevrolet Trax is making waves as the best-selling subcompact SUV, with an impressive 83 percent year-over-year sales surge.\nFrom a brand perspective, Toyota is still out front, with Ford a close second. Honda jumped the biggest market share, while Stellantis\u2014which houses brands like RAM and Jeep\u2014took the hardest hit.\nCompact SUVs Are Taking Over Right Now\nMore often than enough, buyers seek a balance between utility, efficiency, and affordability, so compact SUVs, like the RAV4, have surged in popularity. With persistently high interest rates, the RAV4's lower price tag makes it an appealing option, especially with leasing gaining little traction in recent years.\nToyota capitalized on this momentum by offering attractive financing and lease incentives. Meanwhile, hybrid and alternative fuel vehicles comprised 43 percent of Toyota's total U.S. sales, highlighting the ongoing shift toward electrification.\n|\nMake/Model |\nUnits Sold In 2024 |\n|\nToyota RAV4 |\n475,193 |\n|\nFord F-150 |\n460,915 |\n|\nHonda CR-V |\n402,791 |\n|\nTesla Model Y |\n372,613 |\n|\nChevrolet Silverado 1500 |\n344,022 |\n|\nToyota Camry |\n309,875 |\n|\nToyota Corolla |\n283,098 |\n|\nNissan Rogue |\n245,724 |\n|\nHonda Civic |\n242,005 |\n|\nGMC Sierra 1500 |\n216,248 |\nWhile the RAV4 saw a 9 percent sales increase, reaching 475,193 units, the F-150 saw a 5 percent decline with 460,915 units sold. Ford's slowdown wasn't just due to market trends\u2014production halts at key assembly plans and quality control measures delayed deliveries. In response to its slipping rank, Ford argues that JATO's methodology excludes heavy-duty trucks, asserting that the full F-Series lineup remains dominant.\nFull-size truck sales remained robust, with GM leading the segment, selling 875,800 combined Silverado and Sierra units. Ford's total F-Series sales, including heavy-duty models, grew by 2 percent to 765,649, while RAM saw a significant decline of 16.1 percent. Meanwhile, the Toyota Tundra experienced a strong 27.4 percent sales increase, fueled by aggressive incentives.\nHow-To Geek's Take\nLooking ahead, upcoming tariffs on vehicles and components from Mexico, Canada, and Japan could significantly impact pricing and sales rankings in 2025. With both the RAV4 and F-150 dependent on international supply chains, the competition for the top-selling spot is far from settled.\nSources: Wards Auto, Car Industry Analysis, TopSpeed"

      "text": "The 2025 lineup is full of exciting vehicles, but plug-in hybrid SUVs are stealing the spotlight\u2014for good reason. They strike that perfect balance between traditional hybrids and full EVs, offering electric range without the anxiety of charging infrastructure.\nAutomakers know what drivers want: practicality, efficiency, and a touch of innovation. That\u2019s why so many have doubled down on building plug-in SUVs that are smartly designed, flexible, and packed with value.\nWith so many solid options out there, one model in particular stands out as the plug-in hybrid SUV to keep an eye on. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturer websites and authoritative sources, including the EPA and Kelly Blue Book.\nThe Toyota RAV4 Plug-in Hybrid Is the PHEV That Just Makes Sense\nIt\u2019s probably no shock that a Toyota is in the spotlight here. The brand has a solid track record of building practical, reliable vehicles\u2014and the RAV4 Plug-In Hybrid is no exception.\nWhile many automakers are racing full-speed toward an all-electric future, Toyota\u2019s approach is a little more measured. Instead of going all-in on EVs, they\u2019re doubling down on hybrids and plug-in hybrids.\nSure, Toyota has the all-electric bZ4X in its lineup\u2014but it\u2019s the RAV4 Plug-In Hybrid that\u2019s been turning more heads lately. And for good reason.\nThe Tried-And-True PHEV System Behind Toyota\u2019s Success\nLet\u2019s start with a fun fact: the RAV4 is the best-selling SUV in the U.S.\u2014and it\u2019s not hard to see why. Toyota offers it in three flavors: gas-only, hybrid, and now simply called the \"Plug-In\" (formerly known as the RAV4 Prime).\nThe 2025 RAV4 Plug-In keeps things mostly the same from last year, aside from that simplified name. But under the hood, it\u2019s still packing a punch with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder plug-in hybrid engine that cranks out 302 horsepower.\nAll trims come standard with all-wheel drive and an electric CVT, giving you solid traction and smooth driving. And while towing isn\u2019t a strong suit for most PHEVs, this one handles up to 2,500 pounds\u2014plenty for bikes, a small trailer, or a weekend\u2019s worth of gear.\n2025 Toyota RAV4 Plug-In Performance Specifications\n|\nPowertrain |\n2.5-lIter Four-Cylinder Plug-In Hybrid Engine |\n|---|---|\n|\nHorsepower |\n302 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n165 LB-FT |\n|\nTransmission |\neCVT |\n|\nDriveline |\nAll-Wheel Drive |\n|\nFuel Economy (Combined) |\n38 MPG (Est.) |\n|\nRange |\n600 Miles (Est.) |\n|\nElectric Range |\n42 Miles (Est.) |\n|\nBattery Capacity |\n18.1 kWh |\n|\nTowing Capacity |\n2,500 LBS. |\n|\nPrice |\n$44,565\u2013$48,435 |\nEconomy and Range That Makes Other PHEVs Nervous\nWhen it comes to electrified vehicles, fuel economy and range can make or break your decision. That\u2019s where plug-in hybrids really shine\u2014they give you some electric-only driving without the constant need to charge.\nThe 2025 RAV4 Plug-In is estimated to offer around 600 miles of total range, making it a road trip-friendly option. While the EPA hasn\u2019t officially rated the 2025 model yet, the 2024 version gave us a good preview with 94 MPGe and 42 miles of electric-only range.\nThat kind of efficiency comes from an 18.1-kWh lithium-ion battery pack that quietly does all the heavy lifting. It's a setup that gives you the best of both worlds\u2014electric when you want it, gas when you need it.\nSerious Efficiency, Starting Just Over $44K\nToyota keeps things simple with the RAV4 Plug-In\u2014there are just two trims to choose from. The SE starts at $44,565, while the more feature-loaded XSE kicks off at $48,435.\nEven the base SE doesn\u2019t skimp on features. You\u2019ll get 18-inch black alloy wheels, sleek roof rails, a silver front spoiler, and heated front seats right out of the gate.\nAs with most Toyotas, the entry-level trim is far from barebones. It\u2019s packed with value and thoughtful touches that make it feel like anything but \u201cbase.\u201d\nStep up to the XSE trim, and you\u2019ll unlock some extra perks like a power tilt moonroof, auto-dimming rearview mirror, 19-inch black alloy wheels, and a stylish two-tone exterior.\nIf you\u2019re happy with Toyota\u2019s already impressive standard features, the SE has everything you need. But if you\u2019re after more tech, a bit more flair, and added convenience, the XSE is definitely worth the upgrade.\nA Cabin That Blends Sporty Edge With Refined Comfort\nOver the past few years, Toyota has clearly leaned into a sportier design language\u2014and it shows. While the brand has always had its moments of flair, it\u2019s now delivering interiors that turn heads and feel more dynamic than ever.\nTake the RAV4 Plug-In, for example. The SE trim features fabric-trimmed seats with bold red stitching and embossed inserts, plus standard seat heating to keep things cozy. Those red accents pop up throughout the cabin, giving it a subtle yet sporty vibe.\nIf you go for the XSE, you\u2019ll get SofTex-trimmed seats\u2014a synthetic leather that aligns with Toyota\u2019s eco-friendly goals. The interior also adds soft-touch materials across the dash, doors, and console, all stitched to match that signature red. Whether you prefer practical comfort or a more refined, athletic feel, Toyota gives you both options.\nComfort, Cargo, and All the Right Touches Inside\nLet\u2019s be honest\u2014no one buys an SUV hoping for cramped quarters. One of the biggest draws is space, and the 2025 RAV4 Plug-In delivers plenty of it.\nInside, you\u2019ll find a roomy 136.4 cubic feet of total interior volume, giving both passengers and gear plenty of breathing room. Front passengers get 54 inches of hip room, while those in the back still have a comfortable 47.7 inches.\nLegroom isn\u2019t lacking either, with 41 inches up front and 37.8 inches in the rear\u2014great for long rides. As for cargo, there\u2019s 40 inches of space behind the rear seats and a max height of 33.2 inches to stack whatever you\u2019re hauling.\n2025 RAV4 Plug-In interior Dimensions\n|\nInterior Volume |\n136.4 Cubic Feet |\n|---|---|\n|\nCargo Volume (Behind Front/Rear Seat) |\n69.8/33.5 Cubic Feet |\n|\nCargo Length Behind Rear Seat |\n40.0 Inches |\n|\nCargo Minimum/Maximum Height |\n33.2 Inches |\n|\nHip Room (Front/Rear) |\n54.3/47.7 Inches |\n|\nShoulder Room (Front/Rear) |\n57.8/56.4 Inches |\n|\nLeg Room (Front/Rear) |\n41.0/37.8 Inches |\n|\nHead Room (Front/Rear) |\n37.7/39.5 Inches |\nA Plug-in That\u2019s Just as Smart as It Is Efficient\nWhile most vehicles today come with solid tech, electrified models often lead the way\u2014and Toyota knows how to stay ahead of the curve. The brand consistently packs its hybrids and plug-ins with smart, future-ready features that make everyday driving smoother.\nIn the RAV4 Plug-In SE, you\u2019ll get an 8-inch multimedia touchscreen paired with a six-speaker setup, plus Apple CarPlay and Android Auto as standard. A 7-inch digital display keeps you in the loop with fuel economy and driving info, and you\u2019ll also find five USB ports and a 12V outlet to keep devices charged on the go.\nOpt for the XSE, and things get even better. You\u2019ll upgrade to a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster and a 10.5-inch multimedia display, along with an 11-speaker JBL audio system for immersive sound. Toyota also adds a Qi-compatible wireless charging pad\u2014perfect for ditching cables. Whether you're tech-curious or tech-obsessed, there\u2019s a trim that fits your vibe.\nWhere It Stands in the PHEV Pack\nThe auto industry is fiercely competitive\u2014and honestly, that's a win for drivers. It keeps brands pushing boundaries and constantly improving their vehicles.\nElectrified cars are still the fresh faces in the game, and there's plenty of room for refinement. That\u2019s why plug-in hybrids like the 2025 RAV4 Plug-In are going head-to-head with some seriously strong rivals.\nWhen comparing models, it really comes down to the essentials: fuel economy, electric range, pricing, and what\u2019s under the hood. And the RAV4 Plug-In makes a strong case across the board.\n2025 RAV4 Plug-in and Competition Specifications\n|\n2025 Mazda CX-90 PHEV |\n2025 Kia Niro PHEV |\n2025 Volvo XC60 PHEV |\n2025 Toyota RAV4 PHEV |\n|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|\nPowertrain |\n2.5-Liter Four-Cylinder Plug-In Hybrid Engine |\n1.6-Liter Four-Cylinder Plug-In Hybrid Engine |\n2.0-Liter Turbocharged Four-Cylinder Plug-In Hybrid Engine |\n2.5-Liter Four-Cylinder Plug-In Hybrid Engine |\n|\nHorsepower |\n323 HP |\n180 HP |\n455 HP |\n302 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n369 LB-FT |\n195 LB-FT |\n523 LB-FT |\n165 LB-FT |\n|\nTransmission |\ne-SKYACTIV 8-Speed Automatic |\n6-Speed Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT) |\nAutomatic |\neCVT |\n|\nDriveline |\nAll-Wheel Drive |\nFront-Wheel Drive |\nAll-Wheel Drive |\nAll-Wheel Drive |\n|\nFuel Economy (Combined) |\n25 MPG |\n48 MPG |\n28 MPG |\n38 MPG (Est.) |\n|\nRange |\n490 Miles |\n510 Miles |\n560 Miles |\n600 Miles (Est.) |\n|\nElectric Range |\n26 Miles |\n33 Miles |\n35 Miles |\n42 Miles (Est.) |\n|\nBattery Capacity |\n17.8 kWh |\n11.1 kWh |\n18.8 kWh |\n18.1 kWh |\n|\nTowing Capacity |\n3,500 LBS. |\nN/A |\n3,500 LBS. |\n2,500 LBS. |\n|\nPrice |\n$54,400\u2013$57,450 |\n$34,490\u2013$40,790 |\n$59,345\u2013$76,545 |\n$44,565\u2013$48,435 |\n2025 Mazda CX-70 PHEV\nThe 2025 Mazda CX-70 is the freshest plug-in hybrid on this list, having debuted just last year. It packs a punch with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, delivering 323 horsepower and 369 pound-feet of torque.\nWith a total range of 490 miles and a fuel economy rating of 28 MPG, it offers solid numbers but leans toward the performance side. Pricing is steeper too, ranging from $54,400 to $57,450, making it pricier than the RAV4 Plug-In, which edges it out on fuel efficiency, range, and affordability.\n2025 Kia Niro PHEV\nThe 2025 Kia Niro Plug-In Hybrid packs a 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine that puts out 180 horsepower and 195 pound-feet of torque. It offers an impressive total range of 510 miles and a combined fuel economy of 48 MPG.\nPriced between $34,490 and $40,790, the Niro is the most budget-friendly option among these PHEVs. It also stands out as the only front-wheel-drive SUV in the group, making it a unique choice with strong fuel efficiency.\n2025 Volvo XC60 PHEV\nRounding out the list is the 2025 Volvo XC60 PHEV, a luxury plug-in hybrid that packs a serious punch. Its 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine delivers an impressive 455 horsepower and 523 pound-feet of torque.\nWhile its range of 560 miles is close to the RAV4 Plug-In, its combined fuel economy sits at 28 MPG. As a luxury model, it comes with a steeper price tag\u2014ranging from $59,345 to $76,545\u2014but if you\u2019re after premium features and extra performance, the XC60 PHEV might be just what you\u2019re looking for."

      "text": "Toyota has built its reputation on reliability, and nowhere is that more evident than in its SUV lineup. With models ranging from compact crossovers to full-size family haulers, Toyota continues to deliver vehicles that stand the test of time. But not all models are created equal. Some perform better than others when it comes to long-term dependability.\nIf you're shopping for a Toyota SUV and want the one most likely to go the distance with minimal issues, this guide breaks it all down. From best to worst, here\u2019s how every new Toyota SUV ranks when it comes to reliability in 2025.\nIn order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from various manufacturer websites and other authoritative sources, including CarEdge, RepairPal, Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book, and TopSpeed. All reliability scores were sourced from J.D. Power. Models are ranked based on their reliability scores, from least to most reliable.\n9 2025 Toyota bZ4X\nReliability Score: N/A\nToyota has been somewhat hesitant to make the leap into the all-electric realm, with the bZ4X compact SUV being their first attempt. It was built alongside the Subaru Solterra, with the two crossovers sharing most mechanical components. While it is still too new to judge its long-term reliability, it'll be an important vehicle to watch as it will set the bar for future Toyota electric vehicles.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nPowertrain |\n1x Electric Motor |\n2x Electric Motors |\n|\nHorsepower |\n201 HP |\n214 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n196 LB-FT |\n248 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nFWD |\nAWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n7.1 Seconds |\n6.3 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n100 MPH |\n104 MPH |\n|\nMax Range |\n252 Miles |\n228 Miles |\nThe single-motor, front-wheel drive version of the bZ4X features similar output figures to its key rivals, but the dual-motor model falls short by quite a bit. That being said, it is plenty peppy and will get you around without any complaints, and it features an impressively compliant ride. Front-wheel models get a 63.4 kWh battery while all-wheel drive models get a 65.6 kWh battery, which is definitely the biggest weakness of the crossover.\n8 2025 Toyota Crown Signia\nReliability Score: N/A\nThe Crown Signia is an even newer model than the bZ4X, replacing the Venza for the 2025 model year. It is a two-row mid-size SUV and comes solely with a hybrid powertrain. While it hasn't been rated yet, it shares the same powertrain as the RAV4 hybrid, which features later on this list. This crossover shows Toyota's willingness to move a little more upscale, with a luxurious interior that rivals models from Lexus.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.5-Liter Hybrid Inline-Four |\n|\nTransmission |\nCVT |\n|\nHorsepower |\n240 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n178 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nAWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n7 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n118 MPH |\nAs mentioned above, you'll find the same hybrid powertrain in the Crown Signia as you will in the most recent iteration as the RAV4 hybrid, which pairs an inline-four with three electric motors. It is a stoic and proven system that puts out plenty of power. The comfortable crossover comes standard with all-wheel drive and a robust electronically controlled continuously variable transmission.\n7 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser\nReliability Score: N/A\nThe Land Cruiser originally built its reputation on its reliability, being a favorite of those who love to travel off the beaten path. The current iteration of the SUV is very different from the model it replaces, with a brand-new design and powertrain. Toyota has a lot of faith in their new hybrid inline-four engines, but only time will tell just how well they hold up over time.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.4-Liter Turbocharged Hybrid Inline-Four |\n|\nTransmission |\n8-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n326 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n465 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\n4WD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n7.7 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n109 MPH |\nPowering every 2025 Land Cruiser is Toyota's hybrid powertrain, which makes use of a turbocharged four-banger as well as two electric motors. While fans of the old Cruiser will certainly be sad that the V-8 is no longer around, the hybrid powertrain has some impressive grunt to it. Every new Landy comes with a locking center differential, low-range gearing, and a crawl-control system.\n6 2025 Toyota Grand Highlander\nReliability Score: 76/100\nThe Grand Highlander was introduced to the lineup for the 2024 model year as a bigger and more spacious version of the Highlander. This three-row SUV is easily one of the best value-for-money family vehicles that you can buy today, with very few rivals that offer similar levels of value. The fact that it shares almost every major component with the Highlander means it's easy to judge just how sturdy this vehicle is.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.4-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n2.5-Liter Hybrid Inline-Four |\n2.4-Liter Turbocharged Hybrid Inline-Four |\n|\nTransmission |\n8-Speed Automatic |\nCVT |\n6-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n265 HP |\n245 HP |\n362 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n310 LB-FT |\n175 LB-FT |\n400 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nFWD or AWD |\nFWD or AWD |\nAWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n7 Seconds |\n7.8 Seconds |\n5.6 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n113 MPH |\n117 MPH |\n117 MPH |\nThere are a number of powertrains to choose from in the 2025 Grand Highlander. The gas-only model features a turbo-four that is plenty quick for most. If you're looking for some fuel savings, the 245-horsepower hybrid powertrain sips gas but sacrifices a decent amount of pep. The Hybrid Max model is easily the quickest, but it won't deliver the fuel savings that you might be expecting.\n5 2025 Toyota Seqoia\nReliability Score: 77/100\nTraditionally, full-size SUVs are generally less reliable than smaller crossovers. The Sequoia proves this sentiment by being one of the least reliable Toyota SUVs you can buy today. However, if you're looking for an SUV that is extremely capable, this should still make your shortlist. It is based on the full-size Tundra pickup and delivers some phenomenal towing abilities.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n3.4-Liter Twin-Turbocharged Hybrid V-6 |\n|\nTransmission |\n10-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n437 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n583 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nRWD or 4WD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n5.6 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n107 MPH |\nWhere the iForce MAX hybrid powertrain is optional in the Tundra, it is standard kit in the Sequoia. In a sea of V-8-powered full-size SUVs, the Sequoia sticks to a V-6 with hybrid assist. Despite this, it still manages to hustle to 60 miles an hour despite its 6,000+ pound curb weight. It is also the most fuel-efficient option in its class by a decent margin.\n4 2025 Toyota Corolla Cross\nReliability Score: 79/100\nMoving towards scores more fitting Toyota's reputation for reliability is the Corolla Cross. If you like the Corolla hatchback, then you'll find that the Cross has the same level of appeal. This crossover keeps things simple, aiming to deliver practicality and efficiency at an affordable price. It may not set your soul on fire, but it'll definitely please those with a budget-oriented mindset.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.0-Liter Naturally Aspirated Inline-Four |\n2.0-Liter Hybrid Inline-Four |\n|\nTransmission |\n10-Speed CVT |\n10-Speed CVT |\n|\nHorsepower |\n169 HP |\n196 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n151 LB-FT |\n139 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nFWD or AWD |\nAWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n9.2 Seconds |\n7.3 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n120 MPH |\n113 MPH |\nWhile sometimes there are clear reasons to weigh up the pros and cons of gas-only versus hybrid models, the Corolla Cross Hybrid is easily the better choice here. It may be a little more expensive to start, but it is quicker and much more efficient and comes standard with all-wheel drive. Driving verve is not in the cards for either model, but they will both satisfy those looking for a comfortable ride.\n3 2025 Toyota RAV4\nReliability Score: 80/100\nThe RAV4 is one of the most successful SUVs that Toyota has ever built. It is a big reason that the compact SUV segment is as popular as it is today and has been the best-selling SUV in the United States for eight consecutive years. A big part of its success is how reliable it is perceived to be, with a fantastic reputation for longevity.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.5-Liter Naturally Aspirated Inline-Four |\n2.5-Liter Hybrid Inline-Four |\n2.5-Liter PHEV Inline-Four |\n|\nTransmission |\n8-Speed Automatic |\nCVT |\nCVT |\n|\nHorsepower |\n203 HP |\n219 HP |\n302 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n184 LB-FT |\n163 LB-FT |\n165 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nFWD or AWD |\nAWD |\nAWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n8.3 Seconds |\n7.3 Seconds |\n5.4 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n119 MPH |\n115 MPH |\n117 MPH |\nThe current iteration of the RAV4 can be had with three different powertrains. The performance of the gas-only model isn't awe-inspiring, but it certainly gets the job done. Upgrade to the hybrid, and you'll get where you're going a little quicker all while spending less on fuel. A plug-in hybrid model is also available, with a 18.1 kWh battery that is good for 42 miles of all-electric range.\n2 2025 Toyota Highlander\nReliability Score: 81/100\nIf you're looking for an affordable three-row SUV with tons of standard equipment, then the Highlander should definitely be on your radar. Its identity is built upon delivering great levels of comfort, exceptional efficiency, and a long list of safety features. It has been around for some time, enough to build a reputation for being one of the most reliable vehicles on the road.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.4-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n2.5-Liter Hybrid Inline-Four |\n|\nTransmission |\n8-Speed Automatic |\nCVT |\n|\nHorsepower |\n265 HP |\n243 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n310 LB-FT |\n175 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nFWD or AWD |\nAWD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n7.2 Seconds |\n7.3 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n113 MPH |\n118 MPH |\nThere is practically no difference in performance between the gas-only and the hybrid versions of the Highlander crossover. Both are reasonably quick off the line, getting up to highway speeds quite easily as well. The hybrid model, however, does come standard with all-wheel drive and, of course, is much more efficient. Neither are particularly exciting to drive, but they are exceptionally comfortable.\n1 2025 Toyota 4Runner\nReliability Score: 86/100\nTopping out this list is an off-roading favorite, the 4Runner. However, its score should be taken with a grain of salt. The 2025 model year is a brand-new model, and while it may look similar, it has been rebuilt from the ground up. This means that while it gets an 86 out of 100, riding on the coattails of the previous generation, this model has yet to properly prove itself.\nPerformance Specifications\n|\nEngine |\n2.4-Liter Turbocharged Inline-Four |\n2.4-Liter Turbocharged Hybrid Inline-Four |\n|\nTransmission |\n8-Speed Automatic |\n8-Speed Automatic |\n|\nHorsepower |\n278 HP |\n326 HP |\n|\nTorque |\n317 LB-FT |\n465 LB-FT |\n|\nDriveline |\nRWD or 4WD |\n4WD |\n|\n0-60 MPH |\n7.5 Seconds |\n6.7 Seconds |\n|\nTop Speed |\n115 MPH |\n112 MPH |\nToyota has ditched the V-6 from the previous generation 4Runner and in its place is a sophisticated turbocharged four-cylinder engine. It is smoother and more powerful than the outgoing engine, as is the new eight-speed automatic. Range-topping hybrid models get a 48-horsepower electric motor, making the adventurous mid-size SUV even more impressive."
