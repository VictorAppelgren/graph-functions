  "title": "Michigan bids to become America\u2019s arsenal of rapid defense innovation",
  "description": "Michigan is making a pitch to be America\u2019s factory floor for the future of warfare.",
  "content": "Instead of welding tank treads by the thousands, the Detroit Arsenal in Warren, Michigan, is now 3D printing Patriot missile parts in weeks, advancing robotics and strapping virtual reality headsets on Army leadership to simulate how future weapons are being developed.\n\nIn World War II, Detroit, Michigan, became the \u201cArsenal of Democracy,\u201d churning out tanks, jeeps and bombers. Now, 85 years later, Michigan is again pitching itself as America\u2019s factory floor for the future of warfare \u2014 except this time, the tools of defense are drones powered by artificial intelligence and made with 3D-printed parts in record time.\n\nArmy Secretary Dan Driscoll paid a visit to Detroit on Friday, meeting with a slew of small companies working to break into the defense industry that has historically been reserved for major defense prime contractors.\n\nDriscoll toured the Ground Vehicle Systems Center, or GVSC, with Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin, in her home state, along with a bipartisan group of other lawmakers.\n\n\u201cBasically 60% of what an Army soldier drives or shoots comes out of Michigan,\u201d Slotkin told Defense News in an interview Friday. \u201cWe are a big producer and manufacturer for the Army and, of course, [the Army\u2019s] transformation initiative went right to the heart of how [Driscoll] sees the force of the future,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cHe saw everything from really cool programs of the future related to drones and tanks and ground vehicles,\u201d Slotkin said of Driscoll\u2019s visit. \u201cHe put on some [virtual reality] headsets and looked at one of our growing areas of expertise, which is modeling and simulation,\u201d she noted, which helps to \u201cshorten the string between having an idea and fielding it.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Driscoll toured a new incubator hub for defense technology in downtown Detroit called Newlab and met with a group of CEOs from participating companies, according to Slotkin.\n\nNewlab, established less than a year ago, has grown into a half-mile expanse with over 150 companies, backed by a billion-dollar investment in the city\u2019s Michigan Central Station. There, ideas move from pilot programs to manufacturing spaces to produce new defense technology, Slotkin explained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the perfect marriage of Michiganders having the best manufacturing tradition in the country; fifth- and sixth-generation tradesmen, building precision tools with AI and tech of the future,\u201d Slotkin said. \u201cThey\u2019ve launched multimillion-dollar programs right out of downtown Detroit.\u201d\n\nThe hub positions Michigan to level up with other states that are at the helm of fostering innovation and connecting smaller, nontraditional businesses with applicable technology to the defense industry, like Texas, where Army Futures Command is headquartered.\n\nFurther, efforts like Newlab align with Driscoll\u2019s position that success would be seeing a defense prime contractor being put out of business in the next two years and replaced by work done outside of what he considers the Pentagon\u2019s famously sluggish acquisition system.\n\nDriscoll has testified on the Hill and spoken at public events about innovation he\u2019s seen coming from venture capital firms and tech companies like Palantir, Anduril, Applied Intuition and others at the forefront of areas like autonomy and AI.\n\nDriscoll\u2019s trip comes as the Army is trying to transform itself. Earlier this spring, the Army secretary released a memo announcing sweeping changes, such as restructuring commands and formations. Dubbed the Army Transformation Initiative, the effort cancels big, billion-dollar programs that no longer align with the Army\u2019s strategy and commits to acquiring innovative technology needed on today\u2019s battlefield as quickly as possible.\n\nAs part of the Army Transformation Initiative, the service made major decisions that would impact Michigan\u2019s defense industry.\n\nThe Army decided to pull the plug on a light tank, for instance, built by General Dynamics Land Systems, headquartered in Sterling Heights. The vehicle, called the M10 Booker, was slated to enter full-rate production and was the first new combat vehicle to enter the force in four decades.\n\nBut the Army decided it was not needed even after the service had invested several billion dollars to develop and field the vehicle.\n\n\u201cThis concept of sunk cost fallacy, it is a thing that human beings generally struggle with, which is if you\u2019ve invested a lot in the past, and we do this in our personal lives, you get anchored to things that are suboptimal for the future,\u201d Driscoll told Defense News in a June 9 interview at the Pentagon.\n\nThe Army has also decided to scale back orders that the program office for ground combat systems manages, such as the Armored Multipurpose Vehicle and the Paladin Improved Management (PIM) howitzer \u2014 both produced by BAE Systems. The company\u2019s Sterling Heights facility is focused on land vehicle development and manufacturing.\n\nThe service is turning its eye toward lighter, more mobile capability and is going to invest heavily in the Infantry Squad Vehicle, developed by GM Defense in Michigan, to the tune of roughly $300 million. The vehicle was born in record time and has been gaining traction with soldiers in operational exercises globally.\n\nThe Army\u2019s transformation initiative includes a roughly 38% reduction in ground system science and technology, to include a lump sum of work at the GVSC, and ends some programs altogether, such as the Robotic Combat Vehicle program.\n\nYet, the service plans to invest over $200 million in robotics development in its fiscal 2026 budget request to pursue autonomous capability rather than focus on specific vehicle platforms.\n\nThe Army is also doubling down on its effort to rapidly develop and field a new variant of the Abrams tank, dubbed the M1E3, and remains fully committed to continuing a competition to build the XM30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle, a replacement for the Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle.\n\nAmerican Rheinmetall Vehicles, situated in Sterling Heights, and General Dynamics Land Systems are competing to design and build prototypes for the XM30 program.\n\nA large portion of that development and design work will rely on modeling and simulation technology and other advanced manufacturing concepts emerging in Michigan.\n\nGVSC is looking at innovations in manufacturing to not only look ahead to future capability but also ensure current weapons systems stay ready on the battlefield.\n\nSlotkin said she and Driscoll learned that the center, for instance, had been able to reverse engineer tubing used to connect the Patriot air and missile defense system to a generator that was running into trouble in real-world operations, and then 3D printed it.\n\nWhen problems with the system were cropping up in the Middle East, a schedule quote from the supplier to replace the tubing was 900 days, Slotkin recounted.\n\n\u201cYou know how in demand Patriot systems are, that\u2019s just insane,\u201d she said.\n\nThe center was able to deliver the tubing in 45 days, according to Slotkin.\n\n\u201c900 days versus 45 days is what the speed of warfare is in 2025.\u201d\n\nPivoting to focus on delivering capabilities at what military officials like to call the speed of relevance isn\u2019t just about harnessing technology, but is also about ensuring policy and practices are in place to deliver.\n\n\u201cWe have to be honest that Congress has a role in making [defense] acquisition really screwed up,\u201d Slotkin said.\n\n\u201c[Driscoll] is very open about wanting to break down that tradition,\u201d she noted. \u201cI want to bring home good things to Michigan, but we want to compete on a level playing field. We can show off our grit and our determination. We\u2019re not looking for a handout or just to live off of earmarks. We want to compete with Texas, or Alabama, or Louisiana on our merits.\u201d",

      "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Germany\u2019s Rheinmetall has a new subsidiary and it is planting its roots in the heart of American vehicle-manufacturing territory.\nAmerican Rheinmetall Vehicles (ARV) opened its new facility in the DC3S complex in Sterling Heights, Michigan, as it prepares to compete to replace the U.S. Army\u2019s Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle with an optionally manned one, according to a May 10 company statement.\nThe company has been preparing to compete in the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV) program for years, unveiling its Lynx 41 next-generation fighting vehicle in Paris, France, in the summer of 2018.\nRheinmetall then teamed with Raytheon to submit Lynx as its offering for OMFV in the fall of 2019, but was unable to deliver its prototype vehicle to the Army on time and was eliminated from the competition. Only General Dynamics Land Systems was able to get its bid sample in by the deadline.\nWith only one competitor, the Army canceled the program and embarked on a fresh attempt with a different strategy: One that has a digital design phase in order to refine characteristics needed in a future vehicle ahead of bending any metal.\nRheinmetall remains locked in with Raytheon, but has added Textron and L3Harris to the team as well. Bids were due last month.\nThe company is competing with other major prime contractors like GDLS, incumbent BAE Systems and a team of Oshkosh Defense and South Korean defense firm Hanwha as well as smaller or non-traditional businesses like Mettle Ops and Point Blank Enterprises.\nThe Army is expected to choose up to five prime contractor teams this summer to design rough digital prototypes. The Army will award up to three contracts for a detailed design and prototype phase that will include options for low-rate initial production. The service will select one vendor to go into production.\nARV is expanding by almost 28,000 square feet with room for over 30 team members that will support the OMFV offering, the statement reads.\nThe facility includes two high bay areas that will be used for a hardware and software integration lab and a prototype build area \u201cas the program progresses,\u201d according to the statement.\n\u201cDriven by strong and consistent growth, this early investment initiative demonstrates ARV\u2019s commitment to the OMFV program and the U.S. Army,\u201d the statement notes.\n\u201cThe investments we are making in our operations are a strong reflection of American Rheinmetall Vehicle\u2019s position in the marketplace and positive outlook for the future,\u201d Matt Warnick, ARV\u2019s Managing Director, said in the statement. \u201cI\u2019m excited that our team and new facility are well-positioned to fully support the Lynx OMFV offering and look forward to continuing to change the landscape of the U.S. defense industrial base by introducing next-generation manufacturing capabilities and creating new, quality U.S. jobs.\u201d\nJen Judson is an award-winning journalist covering land warfare for Defense News.

      "text": "UPDATE \u2014 This story has been updated to correct the location for ISV production in North Carolina. A GM Defense representative previously misspoke.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 GM Defense delivered its first Infantry Squad Vehicle to the U.S. Army in an Oct. 27 ceremony at its proving grounds and production facility in Milford, Michigan, just 120 days after being chosen to build the new troop carrier.\nThe Army awarded the company a $214.3 million contract to produce 649 vehicles by the end of fiscal 2024. The service is planning to procure a total of 2,065 ISVs.\nDesigned to carry a nine-soldier squad, the ISV was specifically put together to be light enough to be sling loaded from a UH-60 Black Hawk and small enough to fit inside a CH-47 Chinook, to provide maximum flexibility for deployment.\nGM\u2019s design is based off the company\u2019s 2020 Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 midsize truck and uses 90 percent commercial parts including a 186-horsepower, 2.8L Duramax turbo-diesel engine and performance race components. It also features a custom rollover protection system.\nWhile the first low-rate initial production vehicles \u2014 27 in total \u2014 will be built in Michigan, GM has a long-term plan to move its ISV manufacturing to Concord, North Carolina, where it is standing up a facility to manage its higher volume ISV production.\nThe Army first identified a need for a light infantry vehicle in 2015 when its most recent combat vehicle strategy was released, but nothing materialized until Congress forced the Army to launch the competition as part of the FY18 National Defense Authorization Act. The Army awarded $1 million contracts to three teams in August 2019 to develop offerings \u2014 GM Defense, a team of Oshkosh Defense and Flyer Defense LLC and an SAIC and Polaris team.\n\u201cOne hundred and twenty days from contract award to delivery is a significant milestone, and I am very proud of the team for this accomplishment,\u201d David Albritton, president of GM Defense, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re leveraging General Motors' engineering prowess and immense manufacturing capabilities to bring transformative solutions to the military vehicle market. Our initial success with the ISV shows our commitment to our customer and highlights our unique right to win in the military mobility market.\u201d\nGM Defense has a \u201cvery, very talented team,\" Albritton said during the ceremony, and \u201ctheir innovation, attention to detail, flexibility when incorporating soldier feedback during testing and a magnitude of other factors helped us to win this ISV contract and gives me great hope for how we will tackle other pursuits in the future.\u201d\nThe first vehicles will be going to the 1st Infantry Brigade Combat Team of the 82nd Airborne Division, but ultimately 11 IBCTs will be outfitted with 59 vehicles each under the first contract covering the 649 ISVs.\nThe vehicles are slated to go through tests in the coming year, including further analysis of its air-deployable capability, as well as verification the maintenance manuals are complete. The first unit equipped will take the ISV through an initial operational test and evaluation.\nWith the success of the ISV, GM Defense is setting its sights on other opportunities with the Army and other military services.\n\u201cWe have a strong interest in the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle Program,\u201d Albritton said. The Army is planning to re-compete for the JLTV and for new Humvees to round out the tactical vehicle fleet.\n\u201cIf you look at the size and scale of this program, obviously, this is closer to a commercial-size vehicle, but as you step up in class and step up in weight, we believe we have a right to win in vehicles sizes of that size,\u201d he added.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t limit us there, as well. There are only a few ground vehicle programs across the [Defense Department] right now, but we believe that other than doing a fully integrated vehicle like we do on ISV or what we potentially could do on JLTV in partnership with other companies, we can look at programs like the Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle for the U.S. Marine Corps, or we can look at the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle,\" Albritton said. \u201cBut if you think about power and propulsion solutions, you think about light weighting, think about cybersecurity, there\u2019s other types of capabilities that we can apply in partnership on a variety of platforms as well.\u201d\nGM spent several recent years helping the Army evaluate a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle using a ZH2 Chevy Colorado and the Army is now taking some renewed steps at getting after an electric vehicles in its fleet to include the pursuit of an electric light reconnaissance vehicle.\nJen Judson is an award-winning journalist covering land warfare for Defense News.
