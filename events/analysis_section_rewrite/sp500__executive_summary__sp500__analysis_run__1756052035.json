      "feedback": "The draft is comprehensive but not yet world‑class for a 4–6 sentence executive brief focused on Ford; it drifts into broad regime theory and cross‑asset macro, and includes non‑Ford catalysts that dilute decision usefulness. Actionable edits: (1) compress to 4–6 sentences and anchor strictly to Ford-specific drivers (EV profitability timing, core F‑Series economics, and tariff/real‑rate sensitivity) using the core Ford numbers you already cite (EV loss ~$1.3B in Q2; core adj. margin ~4.3%; ROIC ~10.1%; forward P/E ~10–10.3; dividend ~5%; JD Power 14th of 33) with citations (22PL3Q360, 65UUBU0OR) after the corresponding claims. (2) replace the broad “regime ladder” narrative with a tight base case and explicit catalysts/invalidation triggers: base case near‑term cash flow supports the dividend with a ~10% ROIC in a cash‑flow‑driven core, upside only on a credible EV margin inflection and tariff relief, and downside on widening EV losses or a renewed tariff/real‑rate headwind; specify quantitative triggers (e.g., EV margin turning positive or a sustained tariff relief that meaningfully eases input costs, and ROIC staying near or above 10% vs a drop below a defined threshold). (3) strip out non‑Ford exotics (e.g., Intel governance, Shopify/AI framework, cross‑industry watch lists) or relocate them to a separate, clearly labeled non‑Ford section, so the house view remains Ford‑first and decision‑useful. (4) tighten the structure into a single, coherent causal chain: fixed auto costs/F‑Series profitability drives core cash flow; EV losses cap ROIC and valuation; tariff/real‑rate dynamics determine upside/downside; catalysts are explicit (EV margin milestone, tariff relief, policy path), with explicit invalidation points (EV losses widen meaningfully or tariff shock recurs) and a brief 1–2 sentence watch list. (5) ensure every factual claim has a Ford‑specific source citation and keep the set of sources lean (primarily 22PL3Q360, 65UUBU0OR; add or remove others only if they sharpen Ford’s narrative); reconcile any numerical inconsistencies (e.g., P/E wording) to a single, consistent figure. (6) deliver a crisp example 5‑sentence Ford-only brief as a template to confirm tone and length, then apply it across the full write.",
