      "feedback": "Your draft misses key compliance checks: it never ties the views to Mastercard’s equity or to canonical handles, and the causal chains are too vague.  Replace each line with a single‑sentence view that (1) names Mastercard explicitly, (2) maps to at least one canonical handle (e.g., ust10y, spx) with a clear sign and magnitude, (3) links the driver to a specific catalyst window, and (4) cites the source.  For example, rewrite the first Up line as: “Up | Q4 2025‑Q2 2026 | Fed rate‑hike pause & FTC/CFPB clarity → higher real rates, increased merchant acquisition, 5‑7 % YoY revenue growth → +15‑20 % equity upside (HHKTQ3JYH)”; the crypto line should read: “Up | Q4 2025‑Q2 2026 | Crypto‑payment adoption remains low → 5‑7 % revenue growth, +15‑20 % equity upside (HHKTQ3JYH)”; the Down lines must explicitly state the 50‑100 bp rise in ust10y and steep term premium compressing revenue and driving a 10‑15 % equity drop, and the regulatory crackdown should map higher compliance costs to a 10‑15 % equity decline, each with (HHKTQ3JYH).  Ensure every line is one sentence, includes a canonical handle with sign/magnitude, a catalyst window, and a probability grounded in the cited evidence.",
