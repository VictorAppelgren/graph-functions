  "title": "Adams campaign rally with Muslim leaders goes awry as group \u2018endorses\u2019\u2026Prophet Muhammad",
  "description": "Several Muslim clerics in attendance said they had no idea the event would be focused on endorsing the mayor, but thought it would be a nonpolitical occasion to commemorate the 1,500th birthday of \u2026",
  "content": "Mayor Adams appeared on the steps of City Hall on Thursday for an event billed by his campaign as a rally where Muslim leaders would endorse him for reelection.\n\nBut several of the Muslim clerics in attendance told the Daily News afterward they had no idea the event would be focused on endorsing the mayor. Rather, they said they thought it would be a nonpolitical occasion to commemorate the 1,500th birthday of Muhammad, the prophet Muslims see as the father of their religion.\n\nSome of the clerics even said they don\u2019t, in fact, support Adams\u2019 reelection.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t come here because we support him,\u201d said Mouhamed Mountakha Sakha, a community leader affiliated with the Islamic Cultural Foundation of America mosque on Staten Island who brought along several members of his congregation. \u201cWe were invited here because it\u2019s Prophet Muhammad\u2019s 1,500th birthday, so thinking that we came here to support the mayor \u2014 it\u2019s not doing justice to Muslims \u2026 Politicians are politicians. Wherever they go, they will show their color.\u201d\n\nEven Adam Azam, a former state Senate candidate who helped organize the event and is supporting Adams\u2019 reelection, said it wasn\u2019t supposed to be a political endorsement event.\n\n\u201cWe only celebrated that,\u201d Azam told reporters of the prophet\u2019s birthday. \u201cThis is not an event for any political campaign here.\u201d\n\nSakha shared a poster for the event with The News that said it would be hosted by the mayor, but didn\u2019t mention anything about politics.\n\nRather, the poster said it would be a \u201chistoric gathering honoring the birth of Prophet Muhammad.\u201d The poster had a logo on it for the American Muslim Advocacy Network, a local group that didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment afterward.\n\nBy contrast, an Adams campaign advisory for the event disseminated beforehand characterized it as a rally where \u201cleaders of New York City\u2019s Muslim community and religious leaders will endorse Mayor Eric Adams for reelection during the annual Mawlid-un-Nabi festival at City Hall.\u201d\n\nEven though the advisory suggested otherwise, Adams campaign spokesman Todd Shapiro insisted after the rally that it was a \u201ccommunity-organized religious event, not a campaign rally\u201d and that the focus was Muhammad\u2019s birthday.\n\nAdams, who\u2019s facing long odds in November\u2019s mayoral election running as an independent amid continued fallout from his corruption indictment, claimed reporters were trying to \u201cdivide\u201d the Muslim leaders by asking them about the event afterward.\n\n\u201cThey have one agenda, one agenda: to divide us \u2014 that\u2019s their only agenda,\u201d Adams told the community leaders as some of them were being interviewed by reporters, \u201cSo, no matter what you say to them they will distort it, so ignore all of that.\u201d\n\nIn speaking to reporters afterward, Sakha took particular issue with Adams declining to say, when asked by a reporter during the event, whether he would consider holding a flag-raising event for Palestine amid Israel\u2019s war in Gaza.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no bigger concern for any free human for what is happening now in Gaza.\u201d\n\nThe snafu for Adams comes on the heels of revelations that President Trump\u2019s administration is trying to offer him a job in order to get him to drop out of the mayoral race. The Trump team\u2019s effort, sources say, is aimed at maximizing ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s chances of beating Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, who is Muslim and currently the front-runner to win November\u2019s election.",

  "summary": "Mayor Eric Adams attended a rally with Muslim leaders, which was supposed to be a non-political occasion to commemorate the 1,500th birthday of Prophet Muhammad. However, several of the clerics in attendance claimed they did not support Adams' reelection and instead supported him. The event was organized by Adams' campaign and described as a \"community-organized religious event, not a campaign rally\" by contrast. Adams, who is running as an independent in the November election, accused reporters of attempting to divide the Muslim community by asking about the event afterwards.

Constructed from 1803 to 1812,[1] the building is the oldest city hall in the United States that still houses its original governmental functions.[6] The building houses the office of the Mayor of New York City and the chambers of the New York City Council. While the Mayor's Office is in the building, the staff of thirteen municipal agencies under mayoral control are located in the nearby Manhattan Municipal Building, one of the largest government buildings in the world, with many others housed in various buildings in the immediate vicinity.\nNew York City Hall is a National Historic Landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[5][7][8] The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated both City Hall's exterior and interior as official city landmarks in 1966 and 1976, respectively.[2]\nHistory\n[edit]17th century\n[edit]New Amsterdam's first City Hall was built by the Dutch Republic in the 17th century near present-day 73 Pearl Street.[9] The first structure was demolished in 1690.\n18th century\n[edit]The city's second City Hall, built in 1700, stood on Wall and Nassau Streets. That building was renamed Federal Hall in 1789, after New York became the first official capital of the United States after the Constitution was ratified. It was demolished in 1812 and current Federal Hall was built in 1842.\nPlans for building a new City Hall were discussed by the New York City Council as early as 1776, but the financial strains of the war delayed progress. The Council chose a site at the old Common at the northern limits of the city, now City Hall Park. City Hall was originally an area for the first almshouse in 1653. In 1736, there was a financed almshouse for those who were fit to work, for the unfit, and those that were like criminals but were paupers.[11]\n19th century\n[edit]In 1802, New York City held a competition for a new City Hall. The first prize of $350 was awarded to Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Mangin and John McComb Jr. Mangin studied architecture in his native France before becoming a New York City surveyor in 1795 and publishing an official map of the city in 1803 that was largely discredited for its inaccuracies. Mangin later served as the architect of the landmarked St. Patrick's Old Cathedral on Mulberry Street. McComb, whose father had worked on the old City Hall, was a New Yorker and designed Castle Clinton in Battery Park, among other buildings and structures. Mangin had no known involvement with City Hall after winning the commission. McComb alone supervised every aspect of construction and was in charge of the architectural modifications and detailing during the extended building process.[1]\nThe cornerstone of the new City Hall was laid on May 26, 1803.[12] Construction was delayed after the City Council objected that the design was too extravagant. In response, McComb reduced the size of the building and used brownstone at the rear of the building to lower costs. The brownstone, along with the original deteriorated Massachusetts marble facade, quarried from Alford, Massachusetts, was later replaced with Alabama limestone between 1954[13] and 1956. Labor disputes and an outbreak of yellow fever further slowed construction. The building was not dedicated until 1811, and opened officially in 1812.\nThe New York City Police riot occurred in front of New York City Hall between the recently dissolved New York Municipal Police and the newly formed Metropolitan Police on June 16, 1857. Municipal police fought with Metropolitan officers who were attempting to arrest New York City Mayor Fernando Wood.\n20th and 21st centuries\n[edit]In 1953, the city's public works commissioner Frederick H. Zurmuhlen requested $2.2 million to repair City Hall's facade, which was crumbling.[14]\nOn July 23, 2003, at 2:08 p.m., City Hall was the scene of a rare political assassination. Othniel Askew, a political rival of City Councilman James E. Davis, opened fire with a pistol from the balcony of the City Council chamber. Askew shot Davis twice, fatally wounding him. A police officer on the floor of the chamber then fatally shot Askew. Askew and Davis had entered the building together without passing through a metal detector, a courtesy extended to elected officials and their guests. As a result of the security breach, then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg revised security policy to require that everyone entering the building pass through metal detectors without exception.[15] Davis would lie in state at City Hall, a feat which was not repeated until former U.S. Rep Charles Rangel did so in 2025.[16][17]\nIn 2008, work began on a restoration of the building, after a century without a major renovation. The construction included structural enhancements, upgrades to building services, as well as in-depth restoration of much of the interior and exterior. Due to the complexity of the demands of the project, the New York City Department of Design and Construction hired Hill International to provide construction management. Renovations were originally estimated to cost $104 million and take four years, but ended up costing nearly $150 million and taking over five years.[18][19]\nArchitecture\n[edit]Although Mangin and McComb designed the building, which was constructed between 1810 and 1812, it has been altered numerous times over the years by several architects. These include Leopold Eidlitz in 1860, John H. Duncan in 1898, William Martin Aiken in 1903, Grosvenor Atterbury and John Almy Tompkins II from 1907 to 1917, Shreve, Lamb & Harmon in 1956, and Cabrera Barricklo in 1998.[1]: 69 [2]\nThe architectural style of City Hall combines international architectural influences, French Renaissance and English neoclassicism. American-Georgian is more evident in the interior design. The design of City Hall influenced at least two later civic structures, the Tweed Courthouse and the Surrogate's Courthouse immediately to the north. City Hall is a New York City designated landmark. It is also listed on the New York State and National Registers of Historic Places.\nExterior\n[edit]The building consists of a central pavilion with two projecting wings. The entrance, reached by a long flight of steps, has figured prominently in civic events for over a century and a half. There is a columned entrance portico capped by a balustrade, and another balustrade at the roof. The domed tower in the center was rebuilt in 1917 after the last of two major fires. The original Massachusetts marble facade, quarried from Alford, Massachusetts, and complemented with brownstone on the rear elevation, had deteriorated over time from pollution and pigeons.[20]: 30 It was completely reclad in Alabama limestone above a Missouri granite base in 1954\u201356 by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon, architects of the Empire State Building.[20]: 30, 103\nThe steps of City Hall frequently provide a backdrop for political demonstrations and press conferences concerning city politics. Live, unedited coverage of events at City Hall is carried on NYC Media channel 74, a City Government-access television (GATV) official cable TV channel.\nFencing surrounds the building's perimeter, with a strong security presence by the New York City Police Department and other security. Public access to the building is restricted to tours and to those with specific business appointments.\nInterior\n[edit]On the inside, the rotunda is a soaring space with a grand marble stairway rising up to the second floor, where ten fluted Corinthian columns support the coffered dome, which was added in a 1912 restoration by Grosvenor Atterbury and John Almy Tompkins II.[2] The rotunda has been the site of municipal as well as national events. Abraham Lincoln's coffin was placed on the staircase landing across the rotunda when he lay in state in 1865 after his assassination. Ulysses S. Grant also lay in state beneath the soaring rotunda dome \u2013 as did Colonel Elmer Ephraim Ellsworth, first Union officer killed in the Civil War and commander of the 11th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment (First Fire Zouaves).\nThere are 108 paintings from the late 18th century through the 20th century, which The New York Times declared were \"almost unrivaled as an ensemble, with several masterpieces\".[21] Among the collection is John Trumbull's 1805 portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the source of the face on the United States ten-dollar bill. There were significant efforts to restore the paintings in the 1920s and 1940s. In 2006, a new restoration campaign began for 47 paintings identified by the Art Commission as highest in priority.\nOfficial receptions are held in the Governor's Room, which has hosted many dignitaries including the Marquis de Lafayette and Albert Einstein. The building's Governor's Room hosted President-elect Abraham Lincoln in 1861. The Governor's Room, which is used for official receptions, also houses one of the most important collections of 19th-century American portraiture and notable artifacts such as George Washington's desk.\nOther notable rooms include:\n- The Outer Room is adjacent to the traditional Mayor's office, which is a small space on the northwest corner of the first floor\n- The Ceremonial Room is where the mayor would meet officials and hold small group meetings\n- The Blue Room is where New York City mayors have been giving official press conferences for decades and is often used for bill-signing ceremonies\n- Room 9 is the press room at City Hall where reporters file stories in cramped quarters\nSurroundings\n[edit]Neighborhood\n[edit]The area around City Hall is commonly referred to as the Civic Center. Most of the neighborhood consists of government offices (city, state, and federal), as well as an increasing number of upscale residential dwellings being converted from older commercial structures. Architectural landmarks surround City Hall, including St. Paul's Chapel, St. Peter's Church, the Home Life Building, the Rogers Peet Building, and the Woolworth Building to the west; the Broadway\u2013Chambers Building to the northwest; 280 Broadway, 49 Chambers, Tweed Courthouse, and Surrogate's Courthouse to the north; the Manhattan Municipal Building to the northeast; the Brooklyn Bridge to the east; and the New York Times Building, the Potter Building, and the Park Row Building to the southwest. City Hall Park is approximately three blocks away from the World Trade Center to the west.[22] Pace University's New York City campus is located across Park Row from City Hall.[23]\nSubway stations\n[edit]Located directly under City Hall Park is the former City Hall subway station, the original southern terminal of the first service of the New York City Subway built by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT). Opened on October 27, 1904,[24] this station beneath the public area in front of City Hall was designed to be the showpiece of the new subway. The platform and mezzanine feature Guastavino tile, skylights, colored glass tile work and brass chandeliers.[25] Passenger service was discontinued on December 31, 1945,[26] although the station is still used as a turning loop for 6 and <6> trains.[27]\nAnother station named City Hall (N, R, and W trains) also exists on the BMT Broadway Line, albeit on the western side of City Hall and not directly under it.[28] This station was built in 1918 for the Brooklyn\u2013Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT).[29]\nOther nearby, open subway stations are Brooklyn Bridge\u2013City Hall/Chambers Street (4, 5, 6, <6>, J, and Z trains) and Chambers Street\u2013World Trade Center/Park Place/Cortlandt Street (2, 3, A, C, E, N, R, and W trains).[30]\nAs a geographic center\n[edit]Google Maps uses New York City Hall as the zero-mile point from which distances from New York City are measured.[31]\nSee also\n[edit]- City Hall Post Office and Courthouse (New York City)\u2014formerly located in the southwest corner of the park\n- Gracie Mansion\n- List of New York City borough halls and municipal buildings\n- List of New York City Designated Landmarks in Manhattan below 14th Street\n- National Historic Landmarks in New York City\n- National Register of Historic Places listings in Manhattan below 14th Street\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ a b c d White, Norval & Willensky, Elliot (2000).

      "text": "An important landmark is upon us: the 1500th anniversary of the Prophet\u2019s birthday in early September 2025. Will Muslims celebrate it in a manner that they learn something meaningful from it or will they continue with the traditional method of celebrating it by singing nasheeds? It is a choice Muslims must make themselves. We in the Institute of Contemporary Islamic Thought plan to make it a memorable event in contemporary Islamic history, insha\u2019Allah.\nThe Qur\u2019an says: \u201c[He has sent] an Apostle who correlates for you Allah\u2019s clear demonstration [of power and authority], so that He might extricate those who are committed to Him and do what is right and righteous from obscurity into light\u201d (Surat at-Talaq[65] verse 11).\nMuhammad (pbuh) is Allah\u2019s last and final messenger (33:40) to all humanity (7:158) who brought the message of Islam so that people will be guided to the right path. Naturally, a prior condition is that people must be prepared to listen to and abide by Allah\u2019s commands. Those that refuse shall find no guidance. Human beings are given the choice to accept or reject what Allah has sent as guidance (18:29).\nRelating to the Prophet\u2019s (pbuh) role in providing guidance, Allah says in the noble Qur\u2019an, \u201cWithout doubt, in the Apostle of Allah you have an excellent role model\u201d (33:21). In order to follow his example, we must look at his personality in its entirety and understand the struggle he waged to bring people out of darkness and into light.\nThus, Muslims must be engaged in the study of the noble Qur\u2019an and the Prophetic Sunnah and Seerah at all times. It may be argued that it is not practical since we have so many other obligations in life. This is based on faulty assumptions.\nThe Qur\u2019an teaches us that we must uphold justice at all times (4:135, 5:08 and other ayats). Being conscious of this Qur\u2019anic principle and upholding it, we will fulfill an important Islamic obligation.\nThe Prophet (pbuh) taught us that something as simple as removing a stone from the path so that nobody stumbles upon it is a meritorious act. When we undertake these practical steps, we are living the teachings of the Qur\u2019an and the Sunnah of the Prophet (pbuh).\nThere are also certain occasions that lend themselves to engage more deeply in the study and understanding of the Seerah. This year, the month of Rabi al-Awwal in the Islamic lunar calendar coincides with the month of September in the gregorian calendar. More significantly, it is the 1500th birth anniversary of the noble Messenger (pbuh).\nIt is an historic occasion that must be celebrated in a befitting manner. While Muslims worldwide celebrate the Mawlid (called Miladun Nabi by Muslims in the Indo-Pakistan subcontinent) every year, there has emerged a pattern for such celebrations. There is great emphasis on nasheed recitals. While important, these tend to serve merely as spiritual entertainment for most Muslims.\nIf any aspects of the Seerah are discussed, the focus is mainly on the number of miracles the Prophet (pbuh) performed. It is then asserted that the Prophet\u2019s miracles were superior to those of other prophets.\nGratifying as it may be for Muslims to hear about the miracles the Prophet (pbuh) performed, it needs emphasizing that prophethood is not a competition of miracles. Nor can we, ordinary human beings, perform miracles.\nThus, we cannot emulate the Prophet\u2019s example in terms of miracles. Discussing them may give us some satisfaction but that misses the point of the Prophet\u2019s seerah and his being an example for us. Our challenge is to struggle, like he (pbuh) did, to get out of the depths of darkness and into light.\nDarkness is any state lived outside the frame of guidance Allah has provided in the noble Qur\u2019an and as exemplified by the Prophet (pbuh). Light is that state of life when we live according to Allah\u2019s commands.\nThis brings us to the significance of the 1500th birth anniversary of the Prophet (pbuh). It is an historic moment. Such occasions do not occur every year. Being a special occasion, we must move beyond the traditional celebrations and understand the great transformation he (pbuh) brought about in society.\nThe great tragedy of the vast majority of Muslims today is that we have confined the Prophet\u2019s seerah to mundate issues. Tahara and najasa and the length of one\u2019s beard or how high the trousers should be are issues we are trapped in. This is truly tragic.\nWe cannot overlook the fact that the Prophet (pbuh) took on the Makkan mushriks as well as the two superpowers of his time: the Roman and Persian empires. Given the mindset shaped by mundane teachings, most Muslims would be horrified if it were suggested to them to stand up against tyrants and oppressors to uphold justice.\nThe manner in which Islam, the Qur\u2019an and the Prophet\u2019s seerah are taught in most Muslim societies, any mention of taking on the superpowers is viewed with horror. This is branded as \u201cpolitics\u201d and according to this view, Islam has nothing to do with politics.\nTrue, in today\u2019s world, politics has become the game of the corrupt. It is, therefore, assumed that Islam and the Prophet (pbuh) were not involved in it. This is based on a lack of understanding of the Qur\u2019an and the Prophetic seerah.\nEven a superficial study of the Seerah shows that the Prophet established the Islamic State in Madinah. He promulgated a constitution, entered into treaties with different tribes and he waged wars against those who attacked Muslims. Islam permits Muslims to fight against those that wage war against them. There is no such concept as \u2018turning the other cheek\u2019. It is a convenient myth peddled by the oppressors and warmongers.\nWe need to develop a broader, holistic understanding of the Prophetic Seerah. The 1500th anniversary of the Prophet\u2019s birthday provides a great opportunity to understand his seerah in its totality. Sent as a \u201cmercy to all the inhabited worlds\u201d (21:107), he was the recipient of the Qur\u2019an as well as its first teacher and mufassir. He is also a model for all of us to emulate (33: 21).\nThis places an obligation upon us to study his lofty personality in its multifaceted dimensions. What this means is that Muslims have to move beyond the mundane issues and parables.\nExhibition of books on the Seerah should also form part of such celebrations to familiarize people\u2014Muslims and non-Muslims\u2014with the vast body of literature available. Exhibition of artefacts\u2014the Prophet\u2019s dress, equipment (swords and shields) as well as the hundreds of letters and treaties that he sent or signed\u2014should be part of such an exhibition. There are some original letters still preserved in different parts of the world.\nIf organized properly, it would be an immense contribution to creating greater awareness about the Prophet\u2019s (pbuh) Seerah as well as bringing Muslims onto a common platform. It is essential that Muslims unite during these troubled times and derive appropriate lessons from the Prophet\u2019s Seerah to chart a way out of their present predicament."

  "argos_summary": "Mayor Eric Adams held a rally at City Hall that was intended as a celebration of the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s 1,500th birthday, but his campaign had framed it as a political endorsement event. Muslim clerics present were surprised and clarified that they were not endorsing Adams, and some said they did not support him at all. Adams insisted the event was community\u2011organized and not a campaign rally, while the clerics criticized his stance on Gaza and called for a flag\u2011raising for Palestine. The incident comes amid reports that the Trump administration is courting Adams to drop out of the mayoral race to boost former Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s chances.",
