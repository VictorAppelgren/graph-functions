  "content": "In rare comments on marijuana since taking office, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would decide on marijuana rescheduling in the coming weeks.\n\nDuring a White House press conference on Monday, Trump said his administration was \u201clooking at it,\u201d and they will make a decision \u201cover the next few weeks,\u201d calling it a \u201cvery complicated subject.\u201d\n\nThis marks one of Trump\u2019s rare public comments on marijuana rescheduling since he took office on Jan. 20, and comes a few days after the Wall Street Journal and CNN reported that he discussed loosening federal restrictions on marijuana at his private club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Trump told attendees he was interested in a change, according to people who declined to be named. Guests at Trump\u2019s fundraiser included Kim Rivers, chief executive of marijuana company Trulieve, who urged him to pursue the change and expand medical marijuana research, the people said.\n\nIn June, Marijuana Herald also reported that during a private meeting last week with two U.S. House members, President Donald Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving forward soon with rescheduling marijuana,\u201d according to a staffer for one of the lawmakers present.\n\nDuring the 2024 election campaign, Trump said he would make it easier for adults to access regulated marijuana products and give states more leeway to pursue legalization, indicating support for removing marijuana from the same legal category as narcotics such as heroin. He also supported a ballot initiative in Florida that aimed to legalize recreational marijuana, but it eventually failed.\n\nBut seven months into his second term, Trump has yet to act on marijuana reform.\n\nRescheduling marijuana from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, which places it alongside heroin and LSD as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse, to Schedule III, defined as substances with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence, would make it easier to access recreational marijuana and could potentially boost the profitability of marijuana businesses, which are currently burdened by heavy taxation.\n\nMarijuana rescheduling would also better align with state-level legalizations. Medical marijuana is legal in 39 states plus Washington D.C., while recreational marijuana is legal in 24 states plus Washington D.C.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks on marijuana rescheduling come amid a stalemate in the process to change the drug\u2019s classification.\n\nThe effort to move marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III began under the Biden Administration in 2022. In 2023, the Department of Health and Human Services formally recommended rescheduling.\n\nFollowing that, the Department of Justice published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in May 2024, opening a public comment period that closed in July with over 43,000 submissions.\n\nAn administrative hearing was scheduled for January 2025 but was postponed due to procedural disputes and an interlocutory appeal.\n\nAs of today, the process remains stalled pending the outcome of that appeal, with no new hearing date set.\n\nNewly appointed DEA Administrator Terrance Cole made remarks before his confirmation and swearing-in on July 23. During his confirmation hearings in April and May, Cole stated that advancing the marijuana rescheduling process would be \u201cone of my top priorities\u201d and that he would \u201cgive the matter careful consideration.\u201d\n\nHowever, after his confirmation, Cole did not include rescheduling among his top eight strategic priorities.",

      "text": "Last year was a roller coaster for the cannabis industry. Both presidential candidates, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, came out in favor of reforming the nation\u2019s marijuana laws. But when it came to ballot measures, efforts to legalize adult-use failed in Florida, North and South Dakota.\nBut it wasn\u2019t all bad news. Nebraska legalized medical marijuana, making it the 39th state to allow for medicinal use of cannabis. And in December, the Drug Enforcement Administration held its first meeting about the effort to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug\u2014it is currently in Schedule I, the same category as heroin and LSD.\nEven though federal reform remains at a standstill, the majority of Americans live in a state where marijuana is legal. Currently, 24 states and Washington, D.C., have legalized recreational use for adults 21 years and older and 39 states have medical programs. Cannabidiol (CBD), another active ingredient in cannabis that is associated with some medical benefits but does not get users high, is federally legal. And an additional 10 states have passed laws to permit the use of products containing CBD and small amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the compound in marijuana responsible for getting people stoned. That leaves only one state\u2014Idaho\u2014that does not allow for any kind of state-sanctioned marijuana or cannabis-derived product use.\nWhen it comes to hemp-derived THC, which packs the same punch as weed and is federally legal, nearly all Americans can go to a smoke shop, wellness store or gas station and pick up some edibles or vapes. Despite all of this, marijuana is still illegal at the federal level.\nWith President-elect Donald Trump returning to the White House later this month, cannabis company executives, advocates and lawyers are optimistic about 2025 being a good year for the budding industry.\nThe legendary litigator David Boies, who has brought a case seeking to federally legalize state-licensed marijuana, told Forbes late last year that a second Trump term will bode well for weed. \u201cWe are much more likely to see positive change,\u201d said Boies. \u201cTrump\u2019s default is to let the states have it. His inclination is to let people do what they want.\u201d\nIn the states that have legalized cannabis, there has been a lot of growth. New York, which had a rocky roll out plagued with a wild west of unlicensed pot shops, is gaining traction and surpassed $1 billion in legal cannabis sales just two years after its launch. California, which is home to the nation\u2019s largest legal marijuana market, just legalized Amsterdam-style cafes where customers can toke up.\nPaul Armentano, deputy director of nonprofit marijuana legalization advocacy group NORML, says that while it is exciting to ponder changes at the federal level, 2025 will be defined by changes made in individual states.\n\u201cI think the last four years showed us the reality that executive actions can only go so far,\u201d says Armentano. \u201cThe fact is that the Biden Administration was arguably the administration with the most sympathy for marijuana policy reform that we've ever had but the power to change federal marijuana laws doesn't lie with the President. That power lies with Congress.\u201d\nAnd with both chambers of Congress controlled by Republicans, who have historically not embraced cannabis legalization, he is not optimistic about federal reform. \u201cIt's possible that the Trump Administration might lean on some of these lawmakers to prioritize this issue, but there's certainly no indication from past history that that is something the administration would do,\u201d says Armentano.\nAs for the DEA rescheduling process, the next hearing will be held on January 21. But do not expect a quick decision.\n\u201cThis is a long process with lots of twists and turns, and anybody who tries to speak definitively with regard to either what the outcome is going to be or when we're going to have that outcome is speaking out of turn,\u201d he says. \u201cWe're probably still talking years. I know nobody wants to hear that, but that's just reality.\u201d\nRegardless of the outcome and timeline, this year should be one filled with cannabis making headlines. Here\u2019s where the cannabis map could expand in 2025.\nHawaii\nHawaii was the first state to legalize medical marijuana through the state legislature in 2000 but has not been able to legalize a recreational market. The archipelago\u2019s lawmakers tried to pass adult-use in 2024, but the bill passed by the Senate died in committee. The governor, house and senate are all controlled by Democrats, which is a good sign for cannabis reform.\n\u201cI would dare say that Hawaii is the jurisdiction where the prospects are the most realistic for legalization this session,\u201d says Armentano.\nPennsylvania\nThe Keystone State legalized medical marijuana in 2016 and Democratic Governor Josh Shapiro, the state\u2019s former attorney general, is in favor of recreational cannabis. Every state bordering Pennsylvania has legalized adult-use cannabis, except for West Virginia which has a strict and limited medical program.\n\u201cThe nation is now looking at Pennsylvania to be the next large state to legalize adult-use cannabis,\u201d advocacy group Responsible PA said in a statement after Democrats retained their one seat majority in the House. \u201cThe conversation will also undoubtedly become a major budget item for PA lawmakers heading into 2025.\u201d\nAlthough Republicans control Pennsylvania\u2019s Senate, there is some bipartisan support for legalization. Governor Shapiro said that he will add recreational cannabis legalization in the state budget request this year again, which would be the third time he has done so.\n\u201cFolks are going across state borders in order to purchase it and paying taxes to those states. They should be keeping their money right here in Pennsylvania,\u201d the Governor told TribLive.\nWisconsin\nSixty-three percent of Wisconsin residents favor legalizing marijuana and 86% support medical marijuana, according to a Marquette University Law School poll. While the Senate rejected a bill proposed by the Assembly that featured state-run dispensaries in 2024, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, a Republican, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in a year-end interview that there is hope for a medical program but no hope for a recreational program.\n\u201cA red line for us is that we do not want, like it has in almost every other state, medical marijuana to lead to recreational marijuana,\u201d Vos told the Sentinel. \u201cI think there is a legitimate, compassionate purpose for medicinal, I don\u2019t really see any reason for recreational.\u201d"

      "text": "In a private meeting last week with two members of the U.S. House of Representatives, President Donald Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019ll be moving forward soon with rescheduling marijuana\u201d. This is according to a staffer for one of the lawmakers present.\nThe comment marks Trump\u2019s first known statement this year on the federal marijuana rescheduling process, which began under former President Joe Biden.\nIn 2022, then-President Biden directed the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to review marijuana\u2019s status under the Controlled Substances Act. In August 2023, HHS formally recommended moving marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III, a less restrictive category. The DEA subsequently conducted a public comment period in which over 40,000 comments were submitted, with over 90% either in support of rescheduling or going further by legalizing or descheduling. Despite this, the process was put on hold earlier this year.\nTrump\u2019s comments come at a pivotal time. The Senate is widely expected to confirm Terrence Cole as the new DEA Administrator in the coming days. Cole, during confirmation discussions, said rescheduling marijuana would be one of his top priorities if he\u2019s confirmed.\nAlthough President Trump is not the one who initiated the recent federal rescheduling review, and it will be up to the DEA on the next steps, his personal commitment during this closed-door meeting adds significant political momentum to the bipartisan push currently underway to reform federal cannabis policies.\nIf marijuana is moved to Schedule III, it will legalize the prescription use of FDA-approved cannabis medicines nationwide, while also providing medical cannabis businesses and patients who are following state law a bevy of federal protections not currently afforded to them.\nAccording to the staffer, Trump\u2019s comments came in response to one of the lawmakers asking Trump where the administration stands on cannabis reform. Trump made no additional cannabis-related comments, as the conversation quickly moved to other topics.\nThe Marijuana Herald was able to verify that the staffer works for a member of Congress, but we could not independently verify their claims."

      "text": "The announcement of the call for the reclassification of marijuana's current status has excited industry players, but it hasn't escaped criticism either.\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services sent on August 29 a letter to Anne Milgram, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Agency, calling for the reclassification of marijuana as a Schedule III substance within the framework of the Controlled Substances Act, as first reported by Bloomberg News on Wednesday, August 30.\nThe DEA confirmed the letter sent from HHS, which will now start its own review.\nMarijuana's reclassification is a small step toward full legalization, which would require \"de-scheduling\" marijuana, meaning the complete removal of the substance from the CSA.\nHowever, moving marijuana's classification from Schedule I\u2014containing high-risk substances like heroin, LSD, and ecstasy\u2014to Schedule III, where drugs like ketamine with lower perceived risk can be legally prescribed, would represent a significant shift for the marijuana industry.\nIn political terms, the move would give President Joe Biden a partial achievement as he approaches next year's election.\nBiden introduced initiatives to mitigate penalties linked to marijuana use in October last year. This included pardoning federal simple possession offenses and encouraging governors to follow suit for state offenses. Furthermore, he requested the HHS secretary and the U.S. Attorney General to assess marijuana's classification, considering its medical applications, abuse potential, safety, and dependence risks.\nMoving marijuana to Schedule III would be the most significant federal reform of this substance in modern history. But what would change for the marijuana industry?\nBenefits for businesses from marijuana reclassification\nMarijuana operators would have preferred complete descheduling of marijuana, allowing for more flexibility to fully capitalize on the sector's potential.\nPatrick Rea, managing director at Poseidon Garden Ventures, stated that full de-scheduling is preferable and likely the most suitable option for marijuana. However, Matt Hawkins, founder and managing partner of Entourage Effect Capital, noted that reclassification could substantially transform the landscape for all legal operators nationwide.\nIn practical terms, the reclassification of marijuana would mainly impact the taxation of marijuana companies throughout the nation.\nBrady Cobb, CEO of Sunburn Cannabis, explained that the reclassification would be a massive step forward, validating the medicinal benefits of marijuana.\n\"The move will also allow for interstate commerce while removing the draconian effects of section 280E of the tax code,\" he said.\nUnder Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code, the federal law stipulates that businesses involved in trafficking Schedule I or II controlled substances, including marijuana, cannot claim tax deductions or credits. Marijuana's Schedule I current status hinders businesses from deducting essential expenses on their federal tax returns. Essentially, marijuana entrepreneurs are required to pay taxes on their entire revenue without the advantage of using business expenses to lower their taxable income. If marijuana were reclassified as Schedule III, this scenario would change, benefiting marijuana companies.\nDavid Goubert, CEO of Ayr Wellness, also highlights that rescheduling will bring many benefits, including creating further opportunities for medical marijuana research and signaling to the criminal justice system that marijuana is not a high enforcement priority.\nIn fact, Dennis Curran, CEO of Acreage, emphasizes that there is still much work ahead. However, he acknowledges that the announcement indicates the Food and Drug Administration's recognition, which the HHS recommendation is built upon, of the potential health benefits of marijuana.\n\"We urge the DEA to follow this science-forward recommendation and to take the next crucial step, giving our industry the resources and validity needed to reach our full potential and drive success,\" he said.\nBoris Jordan, executive chairman of Curaleaf, said that the announcement represents a significant political advancement and added, \"It's past time\" for political leaders \"to listen to the voters on this issue,\" hoping that the reclassification \"occurs promptly.\"\n\"We will not stop fighting for legislative reform - which is critical for the protection of employees, patients, customers, and businesses around the country,\" he said.\nThe news further triggered a positive response in the marijuana stock market, resulting in significant double-digit jumps for major players. In fact, Federal relaxation of marijuana classification could potentially enable major stock exchanges to list marijuana-related businesses and open doors for foreign companies to sell products in the United States.\nCritics on marijuana reclassification\nHowever, the reclassification of marijuana would still fail to address other crucial issues regarding the current status of marijuana in the country, and the announcement of the reclassification of marijuana hasn't been immune from criticism.\nIn a press statement, the Drug Policy Alliance explained that moving to Schedule III wouldn't adequately tackle the serious harms in communities affected by marijuana criminalization. The CSA's control would keep much of marijuana conduct federally illegal. State marijuana programs, both medical and recreational, would stay federally banned, leading to potential arrests. Noncitizens might face deportation for marijuana involvement. Federal arrests and prosecutions would continue, old arrests wouldn't be expunged, and many would remain imprisoned for marijuana offenses. This would also maintain the denial of federal benefits to those with prior marijuana convictions and impede fair competition between small, minority-owned businesses and larger corporations in the marijuana industry.\nThe Minority Cannabis Business Association notes in a press statement sent by email that although some see progress in the HHS suggestion to shift marijuana to Schedule III, it's crucial to realize that reclassification won't stop marijuana consumer arrests in prohibition states. During his 2020 campaign, President Biden pledged to \"decriminalize\" marijuana, a promise achievable solely by fully removing the substance from the CSA.\n\"We urge President Biden to make good on his promise to end arrests for marijuana and fully remove marijuana from the CSA. This is the only way to ensure equity, social justice, and economic opportunities in the cannabis industry,\" the MCBA's press statement reads.\nNORML deputy director Paul Armentano said in a press statement that federal marijuana policy reform should bridge the gap between federal and state laws. Rescheduling marijuana to Schedule III doesn't effectively reconcile the conflict between state legalization and federal regulations, maintaining the divide between state and federal marijuana policies.\n\"Just as it is intellectually dishonest to categorize cannabis in the same placement as heroin, it is equally disingenuous to treat cannabis in the same manner as anabolic steroids,\" he said, referencing the substances listed in Schedule III of the CSA.\nThe timing of when the rescheduling could take effect remains uncertain. However, according to some experts, it might potentially be implemented in early 2024, a few months ahead of the 2024 Presidential elections."

      "text": "Over a recent dinner at his private Bedminster, New Jersey, club, as President Donald Trump recounted his move against the country\u2019s top economic statistician and riffed on New York City politics, the conversation turned to a politically potent issue still in flux: loosening federal restrictions on marijuana.\n\u201cWe need to look at that,\u201d Trump acknowledged to the small gathering of donors, according to two people in attendance. \u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019re going to look at.\u201d\nNearly a year ago, Trump suggested his return to the White House would usher in a new era for marijuana, one that would make it easier for adults to access safe products and give states greater leeway to pursue legalization. He signaled support for removing marijuana from the same legal category as dangerous narcotics like heroin. The pronouncement set him apart from many of his Republican predecessors and came as Trump courted younger Americans, minority groups and libertarian-leaning voters.\nBut seven months into his second term, Trump\u2019s inaction so far on marijuana remains a notable unkept commitment by a president who has acted swiftly on other campaign pledges.\nBehind the scenes, the issue has exposed sharp fault lines within Trump\u2019s team. Trump\u2019s top political advisers, who have led an aggressive push to check off campaign promises, have urged action, according to two people familiar with the internal discussions. They have argued that such a move could help bolster Republican support ahead of the midterm elections.\nOther policy advisers, though, remain wary, cautioning that the moral and legal ramifications of loosening marijuana restrictions could outweigh the potential gains and even backfire politically .\nIn a statement to CNN, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said that when it comes to marijuana, \u201call policy and legal requirements and implications are being considered.\u201d\n\u201cThe only interest guiding the president\u2019s policy decision is what is in the best interest of the American people,\u201d she said.\nMixed signals\nIntensifying deliberations are happening as mixed signals are being telegraphed publicly on what Trump might do next.\nScotts Miracle-Gro CEO James Hagedorn told Fox Business last week that Trump has privately assured him and others \u201cmultiple times\u201d that he plans to reclassify marijuana to a less controlled category of substances. The 157-year-old lawn and garden giant has become a leader in the nascent cannabis industry, with a fast-growing hydroponics business that Federal Election Commission records show donated $500,000 to a Trump-aligned super PAC last year.\nBut reforming marijuana policy was noticeably absent from the top objectives recently published by Trump\u2019s newly installed head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Terrance Cole.\nHagedorn said Cole\u2019s recent cannabis snub wasn\u2019t surprising coming from a \u201ccareer law enforcement guy.\u201d\n\u201cI think what (Cole) needs to hear is a call from the president or the chief of staff saying, \u2018This is a promise he made during the campaign, and promises made are promises kept, \u2018\u201d he told Fox Business.\nThat \u201cpromise\u201d from Trump, as Hagedorn cast it, arrived in a social media message last year during the closing months of his presidential campaign, when he was aggressively pushing to expand his coalition beyond traditional GOP voters.\nWriting on Truth Social in September, Trump announced he intended to vote for a ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana in his home state of Florida. Trump then added that, as president, he would \u201ccontinue to focus on research to unlock the medical uses of marijuana to a Schedule 3 drug.\u201d\nMarijuana is currently classified as a Schedule 1 drug \u2013 the federal category for illicit substances with \u201cno currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\u201d Moving it to Schedule 3, which the DEA defines as \u201cdrugs with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence,\u201d is something Trump has said he supports.\n\u201cAs I have previously stated, I believe it is time to end needless arrests and incarcerations of adults for small amounts of marijuana for personal use,\u201d Trump also wrote in the post.\nHe even discussed the topic with Joseph Edgar Foreman, the pro-pot rapper better known as Afroman, when the two both appeared last summer at the Libertarian Party Convention in Washington, DC.\nMomentum stalled under Biden\nFor a time, it seemed change could come before the 2024 election.\nIn 2022, President Joe Biden ordered the departments of Justice and Health and Human Services to review whether marijuana should be reclassified. The next year, HHS recommended moving marijuana to Schedule 3 and in 2024 the Department of Justice initiated a new rule to codify the proposal. Biden called the move \u201cmonumental\u201d and a \u201cmajor step.\u201d\nBut momentum stalled and Biden left office before the rule could be finalized. A hearing the DEA scheduled for the day after Trump took office was canceled and hasn\u2019t been rescheduled.\nIn her statement, Jackson, the White House spokeswoman, noted that the current administration is still contending with the process initiated under Biden. One White House official suggested that executive action is unlikely until that is settled. The DEA did not respond to questions from CNN.\nTrump\u2019s remarks at the recent Bedminster donor dinner underscore the expectation that the president, not anyone else, will ultimately decide whether to overhaul decades of marijuana policy in the United States.\nPrivately, the White House has spent months researching whether and how to move ahead. Chief of Staff Susie Wiles requested affected agencies to weigh in and their responses, compiled by Trump\u2019s Domestic Policy Council, now sit in a report on her desk, two people with knowledge of the report told CNN.\nA \u2018no brainer\u2019 move?\nOne issue raised in ongoing deliberations is whether reclassifying marijuana would undermine law enforcement\u2019s ability to use the smell of marijuana as probable cause for stops and searches, one of the people said. For Trump, whose tough-on-crime platform has emphasized empowering police to pursue drug offenders, that concern could emerge as a flashpoint.\nThen there\u2019s Trump\u2019s personal views. While Trump\u2019s public posture on marijuana use has softened in recent years, he remains a known teetotaler whose opinions on drug use were dramatically shaped by his late brother\u2019s alcohol addiction.\nIn remarks captured on video in 2018, Trump shared other \u2013 unproven \u2013 concerns about the drug.\n\u201cIn Colorado, they have more accidents,\u201d Trump said in the video. \u201cIt does cause an I.Q. problem.\u201d\nProponents of a change have been publicly and privately urging Trump to commit to rescheduling marijuana, arguing it would open research opportunities, create jobs and give clarity to millions of patients in states that have legalized medicinal marijuana, including many veterans.\nIn April, CNN reported that a group backed by the cannabis industry, American Rights and Reform PAC, aired pro-marijuana ads specifically targeting Trump\u2019s TVs at the White House and Mar-a-Lago. The PAC also donated $1 million in March to MAGA, Inc., a Trump aligned super PAC, recent FEC records show. In 2024, the marijuana company Trulieve and the US Cannabis Council contributed a combined $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration.\nOther influential voices have urged action as well. Podcaster Joe Rogan, a key supporter during the presidential campaign, reiterated his call to legalize marijuana on his show last month. And Alex Bruesewitz, the Gen Z Trump adviser who spearheaded the Republican\u2019s courtship of young men last year, has also taken to social media lately to urge for a policy change on marijuana, suggesting it has widespread support. He called rescheduling marijuana a \u201cno brainer.\u201d\nNearly 60% of Americans support legalization of recreational marijuana against just 11% of people who think it shouldn\u2019t be legal for any purpose, according to a 2024 Pew Research Center survey.\nRecent polls suggest the president is at risk of losing support among young men as Rogan and other \u201cmanosphere\u201d influencers grow disenchanted by Trump\u2019s return to Washington. A high-profile change in marijuana policy could provide an avenue to win them back.\nIn a memo reported by CNN earlier this year, top Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio and his partners wrote that changing marijuana policy was \u201can easy way to attract the voters needed to win in 2026, particularly young voters.\u201d\nAlayna Treene contributed to this report."

      "text": "Donald J. Trump\u2019s victory in November\u2019s Presidential election coincides with a pivotal moment for the U.S. cannabis reform, as efforts to reschedule the substance could significantly reshape the future of the industry, with him potentially having a say.\nDuring his campaign, Trump expressed support for rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act, which would acknowledge its medical value and ease the business tax burden. He also supported providing banking access to the cannabis industry and backed a Florida ballot measure to legalize recreational use, though it ultimately failed.\nBut given Trump\u2019s controversial cannabis policy records during his first term, it is difficult to predict whether he will continue to support these initiatives. Therefore, understanding how Trump might influence cannabis reform in his second term is crucial for anticipating the future of the industry in the United States.\nThe Evolution Of Trump\u2019s Stance On Cannabis\nSince 2012, when Washington and Colorado first legalized recreational cannabis, over 24 states have followed suit, and 38 have legalized medical cannabis.\nHowever, in November\u2019s election, only Nebraska succeeded in passing a measure to legalize medical cannabis and establish a cannabis commission. Ballots to legalize recreational cannabis in North and South Dakota, as well as one in Florida, failed. Similarly, in Massachusetts, where recreational cannabis is already legal, voters rejected a measure to legalize psychedelic substances.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nNevertheless, the years-long changing landscape and the growth of medical cannabis programs have shaped Trump\u2019s evolving stance on cannabis, leading to a more open approach, according to Kim Rivers, CEO of Trulieve, one of the largest cannabis companies in the country.\n\u201cI think President Trump recognizes the shifting perspectives and the fact that data and science have advanced across the U.S.,\u201d she said.\nHowever, Trump\u2019s records on cannabis policy during his first term tell a different story.\nWhile he signed the 2018 Farm Bill legalizing hemp production, his administration rescinded the 2013 Cole Memorandum, which directed federal prosecutors not to pursue cannabis cases in states where it was legal. Additionally, in his 2021 budget, Trump proposed ending federal protections for state medical cannabis programs.\nThe discrepancy between Trump\u2019s stance on cannabis today and his approach during his first term makes him unpredictable, raising concerns about the future of the cannabis industry while also offering hope that he may adopt policies aligned with the industry\u2019s needs.\n\u201cTrump\u2019s support for cannabis reform may continue, although records of his first term create uncertainty. It will also depend on his cabinet and public opinion,\u201d Cat Packer, director of drug markets and legal regulation at the Drug Policy Alliance, explained. \u201cHowever, reforms like the SAFE Banking Act and cannabis rescheduling don\u2019t address the issues and challenges that everyday Americans are experiencing because of cannabis criminalization.\u201d\nMatt Gaetz\u2019s Potential Role In Cannabis Reform\nIn this context, Trump\u2019s recent pick of Congressman Matt Gaetz as U.S. attorney general may align with the industry\u2019s interests, as Gaetz is a vocal supporter of cannabis legalization. However, he is facing scrutiny amid an ongoing investigation into allegations of a 2017 sexual relationship with a minor, sparking bipartisan calls for transparency.\n\u201cWhile Gaetz, as Attorney General, wouldn\u2019t have unilateral authority to legalize or reschedule marijuana, he could heavily influence enforcement,\u201d Jonathan Robbins, chair of cannabis practice at law firm Akerman, explained. \u201cBased on his history, it is unlikely the Department of Justice would target state-legal cannabis companies.\u201d\nRepublican Opposition To Cannabis Reform\nAlthough the Attorney General\u2019s stance carries weight, cannabis legislative reform ultimately rests with Congress.\nOpposition within the Republican Party could arise, as many view cannabis reform as aligning with broader drug control issues.\nFor example, Trump\u2019s pick of John Thune as Senate Majority Leader, who is a long-time opponent of cannabis policy reforms, could create tensions between the DOJ and Senate over cannabis\u2019s future. However, recent bipartisan initiatives to regulate and legalize cannabis at the federal level show that conservatives are not entirely opposed.\nPacker explained that Trump\u2019s cannabis agenda will depend on his advisors, but to change cannabis law, he will need Congress. Even with Republicans controlling both the House and Senate, many don\u2019t fully support reforms, and the ones they have backed don\u2019t address key issues. As a result, reforms may focus on business interests, like the SAFE Banking Act, rather than comprehensive legalization.\nEconomic Impact of Cannabis Reform On Businesses\nTrump\u2019s economic plans may not directly target the cannabis industry, though it remains unclear how proposed higher tariffs and lower taxes will affect businesses. However, measures like cannabis rescheduling could indirectly reduce the tax burden on companies.\nSpecifically, rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III would benefit licensed businesses by eliminating the 280E tax burden, allowing them to deduct ordinary business expenses like other industries, promoting growth.\nRobbins from Akerman explained that cannabis advocates and multi-state operators are focusing on litigating the constitutionality of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Code Section 280E. If successful, this would represent significant progress for the business.\n\u201cIRS Code provision 280E is an albatross around the neck. This is the main reason why companies want to see cannabis rescheduled, because it would save tens of millions of dollars a year in taxes that they have to pay right now. So, that will fuel either litigation or lobbying efforts on the part of this industry,\u201d he said.\nFor example, Trulieve recently announced it received $113 million in tax refunds while challenging its obligations under IRS Section 280E. The Florida-based company also plans to seek $143 million in federal tax refunds and $31 million in state refunds, but it declined to disclose the specific basis for the tax refunds, citing competitive, trade-secret, and pending litigation reasons.\nRivers from Trulieve said that cannabis rescheduling \u201chas everything to do with the fact that it is improperly classified today,\u201d and that is evidenced by the report that was released from the Department of Health and Human Services as part of the rescheduling process where \u201ccannabis was found to be significantly less harmful than any of those substances in a host of categories.\u201d\nIn addition to the economic impact of cannabis rescheduling, the passage of the SAFE Banking Act, while not directly targeting the cannabis industry, would offer protections for financial institutions working with cannabis businesses, thereby easing their access to banking services.\nTrump\u2019s Potential Militarized Drug Policy\nHowever, what concerns Jeffrey Miron, senior lecturer at Harvard and director of economic studies at the Cato Institute, is not so much the economic impact of Trump\u2019s administration on the cannabis industry but the conservatives\u2019 proposals to potentially use the military for border enforcement and against Mexican cartels, marking a significant escalation in drug and immigration policy.\n\u201cThe administration\u2019s idea of choosing the military to fight the drug cartels is just totally insane. The only way to stop the violence and take power away from the cartels is to legalize all those drugs so that the cartel doesn\u2019t have any particular profit or have any power,\u201d he said.\nWhile the military focus on cartels wouldn\u2019t primarily affect cannabis, as cartels have mostly shifted away from its production due to state legalizations, Miron argues it reflects an attitude toward drug policy that opposes legalization. He argues that conservatives, generally focused on drug control, may not support significant change and could treat cannabis the same as other drugs, advocating for its continued prohibition.\nOn the broader drug policy, Packer says it may be a more militarized drug war, especially targeting fentanyl and linking it to immigration, which could disproportionately impact immigrant, black, and brown communities. Furthermore, the focus on supply-side reduction without addressing demand-side efforts like harm reduction, education, and access to tools such as naloxone could cause more harm, not less, as resources are diverted from life-saving services to criminalization.\n\u201cIf we increase the militarization and criminalization while simultaneously taking resources away from harm reduction services and redirecting them towards criminalization, we won\u2019t be saving lives; we\u2019ll be pushing people further into unhealthy and dangerous situations in today\u2019s drug market,\u201d she said.\nCannabis Rescheduling As The Base For Future Reforms\nTherefore, while comprehensive drug policy under Trump may lean towards a strong prohibition stance, cannabis may be an exception, as it has already made significant progress in the U.S., with key players in his administration potentially advancing it further.\nTrump is not expected to bring radical change in cannabis policy, as little was seen during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, which, however, initiated the cannabis rescheduling process. While proper legalization addressing civil rights and directly impacting cannabis consumers, such as federal legalization, is unlikely, the approach of Trump\u2019s administration on cannabis may focus more on the business side.\nRivers believes cannabis reform will be incremental, with years of effort and compromise being crucial to eventual success.\n\u201cMarijuana rescheduling from Schedule I to Schedule III needs to be completed, as it would set off a host of opportunities for future policies. I think that\u2019s a very achievable win and something that should be completed as soon as possible,\u201d she said."

This follows a recommendation from the Department of Health and Human Services and a stalled process initiated under the Biden administration. Despite Trump's support for loosening federal restrictions, significant challenges remain, including opposition within Congress and the potential impact on law enforcement practices.",
