      "text": "BMW Championship highlights, results: Scottie Scheffler surges to win\nScottie Scheffler made quite a statement in his bid to repeat as FedEx Cup champion by winning the BMW Championship on Sunday, Aug. 17 by two strokes over Robert MacIntyre.\nScheffler began Sunday's final round four strokes behind MacIntyre, who had held the lead for each of the tournament's first three days at Caves Valley Golf Club in Owings Mills, Maryland.\nThe world's No. 1 player only needed five holes to pull even, took the lead for good with a birdie on No. 7 and holed a spectacular pitch from off the green on 17 to nail down his 18th career PGA Tour victory.\nIn addition to the drama at the top of the leaderboard, the rest of the field was also competing for a top-30 spot in the FedEx Cup points standings in order to secure a spot in the season-ending Tour Championship next weekend.\nUSA TODAY Sports covered all the action from the final round of the BMW Championship. Scroll below for results and highlights:\nBMW Championship leaderboard\n- 1. Scottie Scheffler -15\n- 2. Robert MacIntyre -13\n- 3. Maverick McNealy -11\n- T4. Sam Burns -10\n- T4. Tommy Fleetwood -10\nBMW CHAMPIONSHIP: Full results from final round\nBMW Championship Round 4 highlights\nPrize money payouts for BMW Championship\nThe BMW Championship field split a purse total of $20 million based on the leaderboard results.\nAs winner, Scottie Scheffler earned $3,600,000. Second-place finisher Robert MacIntyre takes home $2,160,000, while third-place finisher Maverick McNealy gets a $1,360,000 prize. \u2014 James H. Williams\nTop 30 finalized for 2025 FedEx Cup Playoffs at East Lake\nLudvig Aberg made the final stroke that decided the top 30 in the FedEx Cup Playoffs standings. It was a two-inch tap-in putt for a double-bogey 6 on the 18th hole. With that, all the points were calculated and confirmed, and that put Akshay Bhatia into the 30th and final spot for the final playoff event. Had he triple bogeyed the final hole, Bhatia would have been bumped to 31st, and Michael Kim would've landed in the 30th spot. \u2014 Todd Kelly, Golfweek\nHere's the top 30 for the 2025 Tour Championship:\n- Scottie Scheffler\n- Rory McIlroy\n- J.J. Spaun\n- Justin Rose\n- Tommy Fleetwood\n- Ben Griffin\n- Russell Henley\n- Sepp Straka\n- Robert MacIntyre\n- Maverick McNealy\n- Harris English\n- Justin Thomas\n- Cameron Young\n- Ludvig Aberg\n- Andrew Novak\n- Keegan Bradley\n- Sam Burns\n- Brian Harman\n- Corey Conners\n- Patrick Cantlay\n- Collin Morikawa\n- Viktor Hovland\n- Hideki Matsuyama\n- Shane Lowry\n- Nick Taylor\n- Harry Hall\n- Jacob Bridgeman\n- Sungjae Im\n- Chris Gotterup\n- Akshay Bhatia\nHole 17: Unbelievable hole-out may seal the deal\nScottie Scheffler continues to do Scottie Scheffler things. And it may have just won him this tournament.\nIn the heavy rough off the tee on the par-3 17th, Scheffler hit his pitch onto the green and watched it roll down the hill toward the hole, 82 feet away. The crowd noise began to swell and the ball picked up speed ... on a direct path toward the hole.\nBang!\nThe birdie gave Scheffler a two-stroke lead with one hole to play.\nHole 15: Scheffler bounces back with a birdie\nHere's a great example of why Scottie Scheffler is the No. 1 player in the world. Coming off a three-putt bogey on the previous hole to see his lead cut to one shot, Scheffler showed his mettle on 15.\nAfter Robert MacIntyre hit his ball seven feet away from the hole for a potential birdie, Scheffler faced a 163-yard approach shot on the par-4 -- and stuck his iron even closer.\nMacIntyre, however, missed his birdie putt. Then Scheffler stepped up and drained it to get back to 14-under for a two-stroke lead.\nHole 14: Uncharacteristic three-putt from Scheffler\nHow quickly things can change.\nRobert MacIntyre looked to be facing a three-shot deficit with four holes to play with Scottie Scheffler lining up an 18-foot birdie putt on the par-4 14th hole. But amazingly, he slid the ball past the cup -- and then appeared to misread the comebacker for par. With a bogey dropping Scheffler back to 13-under, MacIntyre only trails by one shot.\nHole 13: MacIntyre bogeys, trails by two\nA wayward tee shot on the 175-yard par-3 has put Robert MacIntyre behind the proverbial 8 ball. Hitting over water to a left-front pin placement, MacIntyre flew the green into the intermediate rough some 72 feet from the hole. Although he chipped it within seven feet, he missed the par putt to drop back to 12-under for the tournament -- now tied for second place with Sam Burns.\nScottie Scheffler, coming off a birdie at No. 11 and a bogey at No. 12, carded a routine par to stay at minus-14.\nFive holes remain.\nThrough 9 holes: Scheffler leads by one\nAs the final group turns for home at Caves Valley, Scottie Scheffler has the upper hand.\nScheffler pleyed the front nine in 2 under par, while third-round leader Robert MacIntyre was 3-over after both players parred the ninth. Sam Burns, playing one hole ahead, is three behind Scheffler at minus-11.\nRickie Fowler, looking to make the top 30 in FedEx Cup points and advance to the season-ending Tour Championship, is in fourth place at 10-under. Fowler began the tournament in 48th place in the standings, but he's currently projected to move into 25th place if he can hold his position.\nScottie Scheffler surges into the lead\nRobert MacIntyre may be looking for a wire-to-wire win at Caves Valley, but Scottie Scheffler has other ideas.\nAfter making up a four-stroke deficit to begin the final round, the reigning FedEx Cup champion took sole possession of the lead by draining a birdie putt on the par-4 seventh hole. Scheffler got in position by crushing a 326-yard drive down the right side of the fairway and sticking his approach shot to within six feet.\nThrough seven holes, Scheffler stood at 14-under for the tournament, one stroke ahead of McIntyre and three up on Sam Burns.\nAs a side note: Scheffler has finished in the top 8 in each of his last 12 events, the longest such streak on the PGA Tour since Tom Weiskopf had 13 consecutive in 1973.\nScheffler pulls even on front nine\nWell that didn't take long. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler began the final round four shots behind leader Robert MacIntyre, but made up the entire difference in the first five holes.\nScheffler carded birdies on the first and fifth holes (alongside a bogey on No. 3) to get to 13 under par. Meanwhile, MacIntyre opened with bogeys on each of the first three par 4s on the front side (Nos. 1, 2 and 5) to drop into a tie.\nHow to watch BMW Championship: TV channels, streaming\nThe 2025 BMW Championship, the second event of the PGA Tour's FedEx Cup Playoffs, will be televised nationally on the Golf Channel and NBC. It can be live streamed via ESPN+, Peacock and Fubo depending on the time. Here's the broadcast schedule for the final two rounds:\nAll times Eastern\nSunday, Aug. 17\nTommy Fleetwood enjoys some good fortune, for a change\nAfter yet another near-miss last week in an attempt to win his first PGA Tour title, Tommy Fleetwood birdied the second hole, thanks to a quality he's come to embody: patience.\nFleetwood's 28-foot putt on the par 4 hung on the edge of cup for several moments before wobbling and finally dropping in.\nThe early birdie moved Fleetwood into a tie for fourth place, eight shots behind leader Robert MacIntyre.\nHe held the lead entering the final round at last week's FedEx St. Jude Classic before finishing one stroke out of a playoff, which was ultimately won by Justin Rose.\nBen Griffin has a start to forget\nAmerican Ben Griffin has enjoyed a season to remember on the PGA Tour. He's recorded his first two Tour wins and finished in the top 10 in seven other tournaments. He began the final round at the BMW Championship at 2-under par, tied for 16th place.\nHowever, his start on Sunday was nothing short of a disaster. Sitting in the right rough, 27 feet from the hole on the par-4 No. 1, he chipped to within four feet for par. However, he missed that putt, then missed the comebacker for bogey, had his remaining 3-footer roll all the way around the hole and finally tapped in for a 7.\nStill reeling from the triple bogey, Griffin hit his tee shot on the par-4 second hole way out of bounds. After reteeing, he found the rough, missed the green and couldn't convert a 15-footer for bogey.\nThen on the par-3 third, he found the rough of the tee and had to settle for a bogey to conclude the first three holes in six over par.\nOn the bright side, Griffin's body of work this season (7th in FedEx Cup points entering the BMW) has him in good enough shape that he'll still make the top 30 and advance to the Tour Championship.\nSunday tee times\nAll time Eastern\n- 9:05 a.m.: Andrew Novak\n- 9:12 a.m.: Sungjae Im, Jhonattan Vegas\n- 9:23 a.m.: Brian Campbell, Ryan Fox\n- 9:34 a.m.: Thomas Detry, Ryan Gerard\n- 9:45 a.m.: Chris Gotterup, Sam Stevens\n- 9:56 a.m.: Xander Schauffele, Bud Cauley\n- 10:07 a.m.: Denny McCarthy, Lucas Glover\n- 10:23 a.m.: Shane Lowry, Tom Hoge\n- 10:34 a.m.: Si Woo Kim, J.T.
