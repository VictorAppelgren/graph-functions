  "title": "Former New York mayor adviser gave reporter cash in chip bag at campaign event",
  "description": "Lawyer for Winnie Greco says cash for journalist was gesture of friendship and not an attempted bribe",
  "content": "A former longtime adviser to the mayor of New York City who resigned while under FBI scrutiny gave a reporter a potato chip bag filled with cash Wednesday after a campaign event.\n\nA lawyer for Winnie Greco, the former adviser, insisted the cash was not an attempted bribe.\n\nThe local news site The City reported the incident hours after one of its reporters said Greco had pressed a bag of potato chips into her hands containing a red envelope with a $100 bill and several $20 bills.\n\nThe reporter, Katie Honan, had scrutinized Greco\u2019s conduct in the past as a significant fundraiser for Adams in the Chinese American community.\n\nGreco\u2019s attorney, Steven Brill, told the Associated Press that the situation was being \u201cblown out of proportion\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis was not a bag of cash,\u201d Brill wrote in an email. \u201cIn the Chinese culture, money is often given to others in a gesture of friendship and gratitude. And that\u2019s all that was done here. Winnie\u2019s intention was born purely out of kindness.\u201d\n\nAsked why Greco wanted to make such a gesture to Honan, Brill said: \u201cShe knows the reporter and is fond of her.\u201d\n\nThe City said Greco later apologized, saying she made \u201ca mistake\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s a culture thing. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m so sorry. I feel so bad right now,\u201d Greco said, according to The City.\n\nIn response to the report, Eric Adams\u2019 reelection campaign said it had suspended Greco from further work as an unpaid volunteer and that Adams had no prior knowledge of Greco\u2019s actions.\n\nThe City reported that Greco had texted Honan to meet her inside a Whole Foods store after they both attended the opening of Adams\u2019 campaign headquarters in Harlem.\n\nWhen given the chip bag, Honan at first thought Greco was just giving her a snack and said she could not accept it but Greco insisted, according to the report.\n\nHonan left and later discovered the money, then called Greco and told her she could not accept it and asked to give it back. Greco said they could meet later but then stopped responding, the report said.\n\nGreco later called The City back and asked them not to do a story, saying: \u201cI try to be a good person,\u201d the news outlet reported.\n\nA City Hall spokesperson declined to comment. An Adams campaign aide, Todd Shapiro, said Greco holds no position in the campaign.\n\n\u201cWe are shocked by these reports,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cMayor Adams had no prior knowledge of this matter. He has always demanded the highest ethical and legal standards, and his sole focus remains on serving the people of New York City with integrity.\u201d\n\nA text message sent to a phone number listed in public records for Greco was not immediately responded to.\n\nSince she resigned as Adams\u2019 director of Asian affairs last October, Greco has occasionally been seen at his campaign events. Greco had served as Adams\u2019 longtime liaison with the city\u2019s Chinese American community. She was also a prolific fundraiser for Adams\u2019 campaigns.\n\nIn February 2024, federal agents searched two properties belonging to Greco. Authorities didn\u2019t explain what the investigation was about, and Greco has not been charged with committing a crime, but she was one of a number of close aides to Adams who resigned or were fired amid the federal scrutiny.\n\nThe City has reported extensively on the investigation and Greco\u2019s conduct, including a campaign volunteer\u2019s allegations that Greco had promised to get him a city job if he helped renovate her home.\n\nA separate federal investigation into Adams led to a 2024 indictment accusing the mayor of accepting illegal campaign contributions and travel discounts from a Turkish official and others \u2014 and returning the favors by, among other things, helping Turkey open a diplomatic building without passing fire inspections.\n\nA federal judge dismissed the case in April after the justice department ordered prosecutors to drop the charges, arguing that the case was interfering with the mayor\u2019s ability to aid Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration.",

      "text": "The New York City mayor, Eric Adams, faced mounting calls for his resignation on Thursday as federal agents launched a pre-dawn raid on the mayor\u2019s Manhattan mansion and he was indicted on corruption charges.\nFederal agents early on Thursday swept in to search Adams\u2019s official residence, a stunning move that capped a lengthy corruption investigation into whether the mayor and others may have conspired with the Turkish government to funnel illegal foreign money into his campaign coffers.\nThe indictments alleges Adams took illegal campaign contributions and bribes from foreign nationals in exchange for favors that included helping Turkish officials get fire safety approvals for a new diplomatic building in the city.\nThe search at Gracie Mansion on the Upper East Side began at about 6am, just hours before the US attorney for the southern district of New York and officials from the FBI and the city\u2019s department of investigation were expected to announce federal charges against Adams and unseal the indictment against him.\nThe news radio station 1010 Wins reported that the charges against Adams were probably under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (Fara). Authorities have also sought information about Adams\u2019s interactions with Israel, China, Qatar, South Korea and Uzbekistan, according to the New York Times.\nThe outlet, citing a search warrant, reported in early November 2023 that federal authorities were investigating the possible acceptance by Adams\u2019s 2021 campaign of illegal donations, including by the Turkish government.\nAdams, a Democrat who would become the first of the city\u2019s 110 mayors to be criminally charged while in office, said he expected to be charged with federal crimes and declared he was innocent. He added that if charges were filed they would be \u201centirely false, based on lies\u201d. He vowed to remain in office while fighting them.\nMembers of the Democrats\u2019 progressive wing, including the Bronx representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, called for Adams to resign.\nOcasio-Cortez said that after the resignation of several city officials, including the police commissioner, \u201cI do not see how Mayor Adams can continue governing New York City.\n\u201cFor the good of the city, he should resign,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said.\nThe New York comptroller, Brad Lander, said Wednesday was \u201ca sad day for New Yorkers\u201d, after news of the indictment broke, and that \u201cthe most appropriate path forward\u201d was for Adams to step aside.\nThe city\u2019s financial management chief, who plans to run against Adams in 2025, added that Adams deserved the presumption of innocence but said: \u201cIt is clear that defending himself against serious federal charges will require a significant amount of the time and attention needed to govern this great city.\u201d\nThe Manhattan borough president and mayoral candidate Scott Stringer said the mayor should step down so other leaders could \u201cfocus on the business of the city\u201d.\n\u201cHis fight is not our fight,\u201d Stringer said.\nBut other members of the city council had mixed reactions. Oswald Feliz said he was \u201cnot there yet\u201d in calling for Adams to step aside.\nThe Brooklyn progressive Chi Oss\u00e9 said: \u201cCorrupt cop Eric Adams needs to resign. This started as a corruption probe into his campaign and now half of the leadership is out of commission. I\u2019m not going to lie \u2013 they look guilty.\n\u201cMore importantly, no one is running our city right now. Our schools, healthcare, police have no leadership. This city of 9 million people need someone steering the ship.\u201d\nCity council members including Tiffany Cab\u00e1n, Alexa Avil\u00e9s, Shekar Krishnan, Lincoln Restler, Chris Banks and Bob Holden have also called on Adams to resign.\nIf Adams is forced out of office, the city\u2019s public advocate, Jumaane Williams, would become mayor and would need to hold an election within 80 days.\nThe indictment came as the city is filled with foreign diplomats for the UN general assembly, including some who Adams may have had dealings with.\nShortly before the announcement, Adams appeared at a reception in New York at the Metropolitan Museum of Art attended by Joe Biden and Jill Biden, both of whom made remarks. Adams did not address the gathering.\nNew York city hall has been in a state of upheaval for the past month. The police commissioner, Edward Caban, resigned earlier this month after FBI agents seized his phone. Days later, Adams\u2019s chief legal adviser resigned, saying she could \u201cno longer effectively serve\u201d in the position.\nThis week, the city\u2019s public schools chancellor, David Banks, said he would retire at the end of the year. His phone had already been seized.\nThe only elected New York official with the power to force Adams aside is the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, and she has yet to comment on the developments."

      "text": "A US federal judge on Wednesday dismissed the Department of Justice\u2019s corruption case against New York City\u2019s embattled mayor, Eric Adams, after weeks of scandal about the Democratic mayor bowing to pressure from the Trump administration to cooperate on immigration crackdowns while trying to get out from under the criminal charges.\nDespite the judge\u2019s decision, he said the Trump administration\u2019s grounds for having the case dropped \u201csmacks of a bargain\u201d.\nPressure from Washington to dismiss the case had led to high-level resignations of prosecutors who said there was strong evidence against Adams, while the Trump administration had focused on whether charges were simply getting in the way of their political mission.\nUS district judge Dale Ho\u2019s decision to dismiss the case with prejudice, meaning the charges cannot be brought again, was in line with the recommendation of a lawyer he asked to offer independent arguments. Ho argued that had he gone along with the justice department request for a dismissal without prejudice, meaning charges could be brought again later, it would make it appear that Adams was more beholden to the Trump administration than to his constituents.\nCritics of the justice department and Adams said a dismissal without prejudice would leave the Democratic mayor beholden to the administration of Republican president Donald Trump in advancing its hard-right agenda.\nThe justice department argued that the case should be dismissed because it was distracting the mayor from helping Trump with his immigration agenda \u2013 a point that has infuriated Democrats, especially as New York is a sanctuary city, meaning by city law it limits cooperation with the authorities on immigration enforcement.\nHo said that argument violated longstanding norms of prosecutorial independence from politics. \u201cDismissing the case without prejudice would create the unavoidable perception that the mayor\u2019s freedom depends on his ability to carry out the immigration enforcement priorities of the administration. Everything here smacks of a bargain: dismissal of the indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions, the judge wrote.\nNew Yorkers will vote in the mayoral election this November and Adams has resisted pressure to step down or announce he will no longer run for a second term. New York\u2019s governor, Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, decided not to ask Adams to quit office.\nAdams, 64, pleaded not guilty to accepting bribes and illegal campaign contributions from Turkish officials in exchange for favors, including pressuring city fire department officials to allow Turkey to open a new Manhattan consulate despite safety concerns.\nThe mayor had long viewed the case as retribution for his criticism of surging migration during the administration of fellow Democrat Joe Biden, which brought the case last September. Adams found support from the Trump administration, which urged prosecutors last month to dismiss the case.\nAdams shocked many in the city when he went on Fox News with Trump\u2019s \u201cborder czar\u201d Tom Homan and said \u201cI\u2019m collaborating\u201d with the federal government on its immigration agenda.\nEmil Bove, then the acting deputy attorney general, said the corruption case was interfering with Adams\u2019 re-election campaign and preventing him from helping the federal government step up deportations, a top priority of Trump\u2019s. He also said the decision had nothing to do with the merits of the case.\nCritics fear Trump is undermining the justice department\u2019s integrity and traditional independence, turning it into a White House arm subject to his political whims.\nBove took charge of Adams\u2019 case after several senior prosecutors resigned rather than obey his order to dismiss it.\nDanielle Sassoon, the interim Manhattan US attorney at the time, criticized what she viewed as a quid pro quo between Adams and her superiors.\nAdams and Bove have denied any trade-off. The mayor\u2019s lawyers initially agreed to a dismissal without prejudice but later asked Ho to dismiss the case for good, saying the publication of internal letters by Bove and Sassoon about the case meant Adams could never get a fair trial.\nIn light of the unusual joint dismissal request by Adams and the justice department, Ho sought an independent view from Paul Clement, a conservative who was solicitor general under George W Bush.\nClement, now in private practice, wrote on 14 March that the possibility of the case being brought again could hang \u201clike the proverbial Sword of Damocles\u201d over Adams.\n\u201cThe prospect of reindictment could create the appearance, if not the reality, that the actions of a public official are being driven by concerns about staying in the good graces of the federal executive, rather than the best interests of his constituents,\u201d he added.\nAdams was elected mayor in November 2021. Before the indictment, he had already faced criticism because of the criminal histories of people in his inner circle, his frequent participation in the city\u2019s nightlife scene and allegations that he did not actually live in the city, among other complaints from residents.\nNeither Adams\u2019 lawyer nor the justice department immediately responded to requests for comment.\nReuters contributed reporting"

      "text": "A former top City Hall advisor and current campaign confidante to Mayor Eric Adams attempted to give money to a reporter from THE CITY following a campaign event in Harlem Wednesday.\nThe failed payoff \u2014 a wad of cash in a red envelope stuffed inside an opened bag of Herr\u2019s Sour Cream & Onion ripple potato chips \u2014 was made by Winnie Greco, a longtime Adams ally who resigned last year from her position as the mayor\u2019s liaison to the Asian community after she was targeted in multiple investigations. She resurfaced recently as a consistent presence in his re-election campaign.\nOn Wednesday, City Hall reporter Katie Honan spotted Greco near the announcement of the opening of Adams\u2019 newest campaign office, in Harlem. Greco later texted Honan after the event when she spotted her again and asked her to meet across the street from the campaign office next to a TD Bank.\nGreco and Honan walked to the Whole Foods next door. While inside the store, Greco handed Honan the opened bag of chips with the top crumpled closed. Honan, thinking it was an offer of a light snack, told Greco more than once she could not accept the chips, but Greco insisted that she keep them.\nThe two parted ways. Before entering a nearby subway station, Honan opened the bag and discovered a red envelope inside stuffed with cash, at least one $100 bill and several $20 bills. The reporter then called Greco and told her she could not accept the money and asked if she was still nearby so she could give it back. Greco said she\u2019d left the area. Honan told her she had to take the money back, and Greco said they could meet at some point in Chinatown.\nThe reporter then texted Greco, \u201cI can\u2019t take this, when can I give it back to you?\u201d She did not get a response.\nIn an interview later Wednesday, THE CITY asked Greco what her intention was in handing money to the reporter. In response, she said she\u2019d made \u201ca mistake\u201d and apologized over and over.\n\u201cI make a mistake,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s a culture thing. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m so sorry. I feel so bad right now. I\u2019m so sorry, honey.\u201d\nShe then called THE CITY back, advising that we call her attorney, Steven Brill, and adding, \u201cCan we forget about this? I try to be a good person. Please. Please. Please don\u2019t do in the news nothing about me.\u201d\n\u201cI just wanted to be her friend,\u201d Greco added. \u201cI just wanted to have one good friend. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d\nBrill denied that his client\u2019s payment to THE CITY reporter was nefarious in any way.\n\u201cI can see how this looks strange,\u201d Brill said. \u201cBut I assure you that Winnie\u2019s intent was purely innocent. In the Chinese culture, money is often given to others in a gesture of friendship and gratitude. Winnie is apologetic and embarrassed by any negative impression or confusion this may have caused.\u201d\nAfter THE CITY informed the Adams campaign about the interaction with Greco, campaign spokesperson Todd Shapiro said Greco was immediately suspended from the campaign.\n\u201cWe are shocked by these reports,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cWinnie Grecco [sic] holds no position in this campaign and has been suspended from all VOLUNTEER campaign-related activities. Mayor Adams had no prior knowledge of this matter. He has always demanded the highest ethical and legal standards, and his sole focus remains on serving the people of New York City with integrity.\u201d\nFollowing the interaction at the Whole Foods, Honan brought the chips bag and envelope with money back to THE CITY\u2019s office and handed it over to her editors. THE CITY then contacted the city Department of Investigation (DOI). Anticipating possible law enforcement investigations, THE CITY did not open the envelope or count the money inside.\n\u201cDOI received allegations from THE CITY and declines further comment,\u201d said Diane Struzzi, DOI spokesperson.\nLater Wednesday, federal prosecutors from the office of Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Joseph Nocella contacted THE CITY\u2019s lawyers, and on Wednesday evening an investigator retrieved the chip bag containing the red envelope and cash.\nThe Brooklyn U.S. attorney has been investigating Greco since early last year after the FBI raided her homes in February 2024 following THE CITY\u2019s reporting on illegal straw donations raised at Adams\u2019 campaign fundraisers she\u2019d organized.\nThe DOI is also looking into allegations uncovered by THE CITY that she pressured a campaign volunteer to do personal tasks for her in exchange for getting him a city job.\nA Long History\nGreco has been a fixture of Adams\u2019 political career for over a decade, during which time she helped him raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for his mayoral campaigns and connected him to influential members of the Chinese-American community while escorting him on multiple trips abroad to China.\nShe served for much of that time as an unpaid, volunteer \u201cambassador\u201d to Brooklyn Borough Hall, while not taking any official roles for his political campaigns despite her prolific fundraising.\nAs part of the fundraising, she connected groups of campaign donors to Adams, with some contributors telling THE CITY and Documented in 2023 that they either did not give or were reimbursed by managers. Making donations under someone else\u2019s name is illegal under the city\u2019s public campaign finance program, which provides $8 for every $1 in small donations from New York City residents.\nGreco also helped raise funds for a nonprofit linked to Brooklyn Borough Hall as a board member of One Brooklyn, which touted Adams\u2019 initiatives and raised his profile ahead of his 2021 mayoral run.\nOver those same years, Greco also collected donations for a nonprofit organization of her own \u2014 with the stated goal of erecting a \u201cfriendship archway\u201d in Brooklyn\u2019s Chinatown that would serve as a gateway for businesses and culture. That venture, which relied on an archway being gifted by a district government of Beijing, collapsed, leaving some donors with questions about their contributions.\nHer first appointment to a paid government job came when Adams became mayor in January 2022. Within days of attending his New Year\u2019s Eve inauguration on a stage in Times Square with a small circle of close associates, Greco was named his Asian affairs director at a salary of $100,000, while her niece also landed a role at City Hall, eventually becoming one of the mayor\u2019s schedulers.\nGreco was so close to Adams and his inner circle that his senior advisor, Ingrid-Lewis Martin, was known to introduce Greco at events as \u201cmy sister.\u201d Lewis-Martin is currently being prosecuted by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for allegedly receiving bribes and is expected to be indicted Thursday on influence-peddling charges.\nIn November 2023, THE CITY reported on two instances where people who interacted with Greco alleged that she had misused her government position.\nA businessperson told THE CITY that Greco allegedly demanded $10,000 to her archway nonprofit as the cost of entry to a Chinese-themed event with Adams at Gracie mansion, for what was a free event.\nAdditionally, a campaign volunteer claimed that Greco promised to help him get a city job if he helped oversee renovations to her home in The Bronx, which he did. After he was hired by the Adams administration, Greco continued to compel him to assist her with construction-related tasks and other personal business while on the job, the aide claimed.\nIn an unusual arrangement, Greco also lived for nearly nine months in a two-room suite at a Queens hotel that was under city contract to house formerly incarcerated individuals.\nThe mayor\u2019s press office and an attorney for the hotel owners asserted to THE CITY that Greco paid for her hotel stay but did not provide evidence.\nThe city Department of Investigation opened a probe in November 2023 after THE CITY\u2019s reporting. In February 2024, the FBI raided Greco\u2019s Bronx home and a second house nearby she had purchased recently. She then went on medical leave for a few months and came back to City Hall with a new role, and an increased salary of close to $200,000.\nShe resigned from the mayor\u2019s office in October."
