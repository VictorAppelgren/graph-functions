  "title": "Italy Hopes Growing Chinese Passion For Winter Sports Leads To Olympic Business Gold",
  "description": "China's ski industry has been one of the world's fastest-growing since Beijing hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics",
  "content": "When it comes to ancient culture, few countries rank with Italy and China in influence and depth. Italy has the most UNESCO World Heritage sites \u2013 61, followed closely by China with 60. In the here and now, the two cultural superpowers are finding a new common interest: winter sports.\n\nItaly has longer-standing success when it comes to ski visits. Last year, it had 32 million, ranking No. 4 in the world. Interest and investment in skiing in China has taken off since the country hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics, however, turning it into one of the fastest-growing ski markets in the world. From May 2023 to April 2024, the number of skier visits at domestic ski resorts was 23 million, a year-on-year increase of 16% and more than double that of decade ago, according to the China Ski Industry White Book. The number of ski resorts open to the public in 2023-2024 rose by 22 from a year earlier to 719, the report said.\n\nWith Italy poised to host the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano Cortina on Feb. 6-22, businesses from the southern European country are looking to seize upon growing Chinese interest in winter sports to promote commerce related to tourism, skiing and travel at home, said Lorenzo Riccardi, chairman of the China-Italy Chamber of Commerce in a recent Zoom interview. The Beijing-headquartered business group has about 800 members.\n\n\u201cWe know that China really focused on the Olympics in terms of communications, brands and company exposure\u201d in 2022, Riccardi said. \u201cWe believe it is a very important opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe push comes at a time when changes in global trade are leading countries to look for new partners and common bonds. New U.S. tariffs of 15% on most imports from Europe are \u201csignificantly\u201d impacting the Italian economy and \u201cMade in Italy\u201d exports to the U.S., Riccardi said. \u201cThe Italian government is looking to new markets and emerging regions,\u201d mainly in the Far East, to offset the blow, he said.\n\nThe disruption to Italian companies already invested in China is less than it might be for newcomers because they have already adjusted supply chains and flows of goods in recent years, Riccardi said. Italian investment in China is increasingly for China or regional Asian markets \u2013 not aimed at shipments to the U.S., he said.\n\nItalian businesses benefit from the locally well-received centuries-old travels of businessman Marco Polo along the Silk Road, and more recent ties between the European Union and China, which this year marked 50 years of diplomatic relations. Two-way trade between Italy and the EU was $36 billion in the first half of 2025 \u2013 little changed year-on-year; the EU is China\u2019s largest trading partner after the ASEAN block.\n\nHigh-profile visits by Italian government leaders have also helped. Italy\u2019s Deputy Premier and Transport Minister Matteo Salvini visited China in July to give a boost to businesses ranging from machinery makers to fashion brands; he also highlighted the convenience of domestic travel within Italy on the country\u2019s high-speed rail system, and complemented China on its advances. \u201cChina is an innovation giant that cannot be ignored,\u201d Salvini reportedly said. Italy Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni traveled to Beijing last year and reached an agreement on a three-year action plan.\n\nChina\u2019s interest in winter sports took off after the government embraced the industry ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympics. Chinese athletes rose to the moment, winning a record 15 Winter Olympics medals including nine gold (Italy had 17), attracting a large social media audience and new skiers and snowboarders to the slopes.\n\n\u201cIf the (Beijing) Olympic Games in 2008 were relevant, the Winter Olympics (in 2022) were even more interesting in generating new trends in terms of the Chinese market and the experience of Chinese consumers,\u201d Riccardi said. This year, \u201cluxury and fashion brands traditionally not into sports or the mountain economy are now focusing on this segment as a new niche market,\u201d he said, including Prada and Georgio Armani.\n\nItalian companies know from home how winter sports such as skiing can help regional economies and business due to the popularity of those activities in the Italian Alps and earlier Olympic experience. The country first hosted the Winter Olympics in the ski town of Cortina d'Ampezzo (abbreviated as Cortina) in 1956; Italy then hosted the Summer Olympics in Rome in 1960, and the Winter Olympics again in Turin in 2006.\n\nBusinesses have \u201cexcellent\u201d experience in sports, tourism, hospitality and lifestyle pursuits, Riccardi said. One Italian company, TechnoAlpin, had a notable presence at the 2022 games in China as a supplier of the artificial snow.\n\n\u201cWe believe it is an opportunity to attract Chinese tourists, consumers and travelers, and an opportunity to promote cooperation between Italian and Chinese companies,\u201d he said. The China-Italy Chamber itself will focus on the Olympics, winter sports and culture at its annual gathering in Beijing, \u201cNotte Italiana,\u201d in November. Chinese corporate sponsors to the 2026 games include Alibaba, Mengniu and TCL.\n\nTo be sure, business is China remains challenging for Italian and other foreign firms. \u201cCompetition with local and international companies in the Chinese market is the No. 1 challenge for Italian investments into China,\u201d Riccardi said. Geopolitical instability, changing global tariffs, new trends in economic relations with other major economies, rising operational costs and supply chain disruptions \u201care considered the major challenges for Italian companies in China\u201d by Chamber members, Riccardi said.\n\nAnd yet the opportunities remain at a time when China\u2019s GDP growth of 5% is among the world\u2019s best. Based on a member survey in July, Riccardi said Italian companies \u2013 as a group the second largest manufacturers in Europe -- see industrial innovation as an opportunity to show \u201cMade in Italy\u201d technology. \u201cThe rising demands of the Chinese middle class can create opportunities for Italian quality products and foreign brands looking to this giant market that is China,\u201d he said.\n\nPartnership with Chinese groups is considered an avenue for expansion into the market by Italian firms, Riccardi continued. \u201cItalian companies consider that it is necessary to have a long-term and stable presence in the market\u201d that often involves one or more local partners, he said.\n\nItalians in Shanghai first formed a chamber-like organization to advance local exchanges in 1903, Riccardi noted. \u201cNot only Marco Polo is a symbol,\u201d said Riccardi. \u201cWe have had our business community long present.\u201d Cultural heritage between the two ancient cultures \u201cis very relevant for companies\u201d even today, he said.",

      "text": "Global Ski Industry Rankings: Nine Countries Control 366 Million Annual Visits\nMichael Fulton\nUSA Leads Global Ski Industry as Nine Countries Dominate 366 Million Annual Visits\nThe global ski industry continues to be controlled by just nine countries, with fascinating patterns emerging from the latest visitor data. When most people think about skiing destinations, images of Swiss Alps, Japanese powder, or American mega-resorts come to mind. But the reality of where people actually ski tells a different story entirely.\nAccording to Laurence Vanat's 2025 International Report on Snow & Mountain Tourism, the 2023-24 season saw 366 million skier visits worldwide. What's striking is how concentrated this massive industry really is - only three nations attract more than 50 million visits annually, and just nine countries crack into double-digit millions.\nThese numbers reveal trends that go far beyond simple popularity contests. From Sweden's impressive per-capita performance to China's retention struggles, and the ongoing economic battles between traditional European destinations, the data tells the real story of where skiing is heading.\nThe 9 Countries That ACTUALLY Dominate World Skiing (2024 Data)\nNumber 9: Sweden \u2014 10.5 Million Skier Visits\nSweden kicks off our countdown with 10.5 million skier visits, and here's what makes this figure remarkable - Sweden has a population of just 10.6 million people. They're achieving nearly one skier visit per resident, with only 15% coming from foreign tourists. That's domestic participation on a level most countries would envy.\nThe country operates over 200 ski areas, with the largest concentrated in central regions along the Scandinavian Mountains near the Norwegian border. Resorts like \u00c5re, S\u00e4len, and Idre Fj\u00e4ll have led substantial infrastructure investments over the past decade, creating modern facilities that rival anywhere in Europe.\nClimate change might actually work in Sweden's favour. As warmer temperatures threaten snow reliability in traditional European Alps, northern countries like Sweden could see increased demand from international visitors seeking guaranteed snow conditions. It's an interesting twist - whilst southern resorts worry about their future, Sweden sits pretty with reliable winters and growing recognition.\nNumber 8: Canada \u2014 17.5 Million Skier Visits\nCanada sits in eighth place with 17.5 million skier visits, though this represents a significant decline from their usual numbers. In strong winter seasons, Canada easily breaks the 20 million barrier - last year's visits were down almost 15% from the previous season due to below-average snow conditions.\nAbout 12% of Canada's skiers are foreign visitors, predominantly Americans at 67%, followed by Mexicans at 4% and Australians at 2%. For American skiers, Canada offers a closer and more affordable alternative to domestic resorts, particularly with exchange rates often working in their favour.\nHowever, last season's decline isn't just about poor snow or reduced foreign tourism - it's largely attributed to Canada's cost-of-living crisis affecting domestic participation. When mortgage payments and grocery bills squeeze household budgets, ski trips become luxury expenses. The most internationally recognised Canadian destinations remain Whistler and the Banff area resorts, but even these iconic locations felt the economic pinch.\nNumber 7: China \u2014 23.1 Million Skier Visits\nChina takes seventh place with 23.08 million skier visits, marking a 16.3% increase from the previous season. This represents the fastest-growing ski market globally, with both skier numbers and resort count increasing steadily year after year.\nMuch of this growth comes from China's massive expansion of indoor ski centres, which alone attract close to 5 million visitors annually. Last season, China opened 30 new ski resorts - 15 indoor facilities and 15 outdoor resorts. The scale of development is staggering by any international standard.\nBut here's the challenge that keeps industry analysts awake at night: retention. China has 12.8 million skiers, but up to 70% of ski visitors are first-timers who often don't return. Poor instruction, high costs, and a lack of established ski culture mean many try skiing as a one-off novelty rather than developing it as a regular activity. Until China cracks the retention puzzle, it remains a market of massive potential rather than sustained growth.\nNumber 6: Switzerland \u2014 23.1 Million Skier Visits\nSwitzerland narrowly beats China with 23.14 million skier visits - roughly 60,000 more visits. However, unlike China's growth trajectory, Switzerland's numbers continue declining from a peak of almost 35 million visits two decades ago. For a country synonymous with Alpine skiing, this decline tells a sobering story.\nThe culprit? The strong Swiss Franc has made Switzerland prohibitively expensive for foreign visitors, who increasingly choose cheaper Alpine alternatives in Austria, Italy, or France. This is particularly impactful since foreign tourists are crucial to the Swiss ski industry's economics - they typically spend more and stay longer than domestic visitors.\nDespite these challenges, Switzerland still attracts significant American tourism, with 2023-24 marking a record year with 463,000 US winter guests - the second largest group of foreign visitors behind Germany's 676,000. American skiers seem willing to pay premium prices for Swiss prestige, though whether this continues as costs rise remains questionable.\nPhotos from these global powerhouse ski resorts.\nHeavenly Ski Resort \u00a9 SnowStash\nKitzsteinhorn Glacier \u00a9 SnowStash\nNiseko's famous single chair. \u00a9 SnowStash\nThe base of Park City Mountain Resort. \u00a9 SnowStash\nFurano Ski Resort in full view. \u00a9 SnowStash\nThe towering peaks around Saalbach Hinterglemm. \u00a9 SnowStash\nThe legendary KT-22 at Palisades Tahoe. \u00a9 SnowStash\nNumber 5: Japan \u2014 24.4 Million Skier Visits\nJapan rounds out our top five with 24.4 million skier visits, down from 26 million the previous year. However, early indicators suggest this season's exceptional snow conditions will drive numbers much higher - Japan's powder reputation continues growing internationally.\nJapan faces an interesting paradox that mirrors broader demographic trends. Whilst the inbound market from Australia and America is booming, the domestic market is declining. An ageing demographic isn't being replaced by younger generations in sufficient numbers, creating long-term sustainability concerns.\nThis demographic shift has created tensions at some resorts. The Sales Manager for Nozawa Onsen stated they're experiencing \"overtourism\" due to increasing foreign tourists, with some resorts reaching fatigue over perceived disrespectful behaviour from international visitors. It's a delicate balance between economic necessity and cultural preservation.\nNumber 4: Italy \u2014 32 Million Skier Visits\nItaly claims fourth place with 32 million skier visits, representing 4% growth and bucking the trend of declining or stagnating numbers seen elsewhere in Europe. A decade ago, Switzerland had more skier visits than Italy - now Italy attracts almost 50% more visitors.\nItaly recorded 54% foreign skier visits last season - the highest percentage of any ski country. The nation is particularly popular with Polish, Czech, American, British, and German tourists, attracted by great skiing, delicious food, reasonable prices, and the famous Italian approach to life.\nAmerican visitors have been particularly drawn by multi-resort passes like Epic and Ikon, which include Italian destinations. The combination of reliable Alpine conditions, excellent cuisine, and competitive pricing compared to Switzerland has made Italy the smart choice for value-conscious international skiers.\nNumber 3: Austria \u2014 50.1 Million Skier Visits\nAustria breaks into the exclusive 50-million club with 50.1 million skier visits. The country's hotel industry recorded 71 million overnight stays during the 2023-24 winter season, with 77% booked by foreign tourists - highlighting Austria's role as Europe's winter tourism powerhouse.\nGermans make up by far the largest group of foreign visitors, followed by the Netherlands, UK, and Czech Republic. American visitors have been the strongest growing segment, with nearly 1 million recorded visits - a 13% increase from the previous season.\nAustria has invested more than \u20ac6 billion in lift infrastructure over the past decade, establishing one of the world's most modern systems. High-speed, detachable chairs with bubble covers and seat heating are standard rather than exceptional - a stark contrast to many other ski destinations where such amenities remain luxury features.\nNumber 2: France \u2014 51.9 Million Skier Visits\nFrance takes second place with 51.9 million skier visits, beating Austria by just under 2 million visits. The country has seen a surge in American skiers, with some areas like M\u00e9ribel reporting a 59% increase in US visitors - a trend driven partly by favourable exchange rates and aggressive marketing.\nFrance's appeal to overseas tourists is partly economic - it's 11% cheaper than Austria and 17% cheaper than Switzerland. However, France relies less on foreign tourists than Austria, with almost 9 million domestic skiers comprising over 70% of visits. This domestic strength provides stability that purely tourism-dependent destinations lack.\nUnlike Austria and Switzerland's traditionally locally-owned resorts, many French destinations are operated by Compagnie des Alpes, one of the world's largest ski resort operators managing famous resorts like La Plagne, Les Arcs, Tignes, Val d'Is\u00e8re, and M\u00e9ribel. This corporate consolidation brings efficiency but sometimes at the expense of local character.\nNumber 1: United States \u2014 60.5 Million Skier Visits\nThe United States reigns supreme with 60.5 million skier visits in 2023-24, though this represents a 7.5% decrease from the record 65.4 million visits in 2022-23. Despite the decline, America's dominance remains unchallenged, with numbers that dwarf most other countries combined.\nThe American ski industry is overwhelmingly domestic, with 95-97% of visits from domestic skiers. High lift pass costs deter overseas visitors, with the small 3-5% foreign component primarily coming from English-speaking countries like Canada, the UK, and Australia, plus significant numbers from Mexico and Brazil.\nForeign visitors typically gravitate toward luxury destinations like Aspen or Deer Valley, which offer massive terrain and global recognition. The mega-pass revolution, led by Epic and Ikon passes, has reshaped how Americans ski, encouraging multi-resort visits and creating new travel patterns across the continent.\nThe Big Picture\nThese nine countries represent the powerhouses of global skiing, accounting for the vast majority of the world's 366 million skier visits in 2023-24. The top three Western countries alone - USA, France, and Austria - claimed 44% of all global skier visits, demonstrating just how concentrated this industry really is.\nInterestingly, the expected decline from retiring baby boomers hasn't materialised as anticipated. Many older skiers continue participating due to improved longevity and health, even if skiing less frequently. This demographic resilience has helped maintain participation levels despite concerns about generational replacement.\nChina's emerging market bears watching as the biggest potential disruptor, though Western markets continue dominating for now. The data reveals fascinating regional dynamics - from Switzerland's price-driven decline to Italy's value-driven growth, Japan's demographic challenges, and America's domestic dominance.\nThe trends shaping tomorrow's ski industry are already visible in today's numbers. Climate change, economic pressures, demographic shifts, and changing travel patterns all influence where people choose to ski. Understanding these power dynamics becomes crucial for anyone following where the industry heads next."

      "text": "Ancient Greek philosophy has been enjoying a renaissance of interest and analysis of late. One of the largest Facebook groups for beginners with an interest in the field, \u201cStoicism,\u201d boasts 225,000 followers. Forbes China, the Chinese language edition of Forbes, organized an \u201cAncient Wisdom, Modern Compass\u201d event on Nov. 9 in Shanghai to help boost China-EU economic ties and explore the relevance of ancient culture in modern business.\nMassimo Pigliucci, a philosophy professor at the City College of New York, explored by video Stoicism\u2019s relevant in today\u2019s world and the forces propelling its modern-day renaissance. Pigliucci is the author or editor of 15 books including the best selling How to Be A Stoic: Using Ancient Philosophy to Live a Modern Life along with most recently Think like a Stoic: Ancient Wisdom for Today\u2019s World. He attributed growing interest in Stoicism in part to declining interest in traditional religion and also to social media, which has made it relatively easy for those with an interest in ancient philosophies to exchange ideas. Excerpts of Pigliucci's interview with Forbes China\u2019s Julie Lu follow.\nLu: How did you become interested in Stoicism?\nPigliucci: It was a midlife crisis. Like a lot of people at some point \u2014 life happens and you experience a number of setbacks and things happen that you did not expect. There was a particular year where I got several of them. Like my father died, for instance, which is something that happens to everybody. But when it happens to you, that's something that makes you think. How do I react? And how do I handle these kind of things? Since I was a philosopher I figured, well, surely philosophy has resources for dealing with this kind of practical life situations. And so I kind of deliberately started looking to different possible philosophies of life. I grew up Catholic in Rome, Italy, but I left the church when I was a teenager. I considered myself a secular humanist for a long time, but it turns out that secular humanism wasn't really being particularly helpful in terms of practical guidance on how to deal with setbacks.\nAnd so I started more or less systematically looking at different philosophies of life beginning with Buddhism, actually, and continuing with some of the ancient Greek philosophies of Aristotelianism and Epicureanism. But none of this was actually clicking. These were all very interesting and telling me interesting things that I could appreciate. At the same time, nothing really clicked in the back of my head and nothing said: \u201cThis is the way you want to do things.\u201d\nUntil one day I was looking at my Twitter feed \u2014 of all things \u2013 and I saw this thing that said, \u201cHelp Us Celebrate Stoic Week.\u201d And I thought, \u201cWhat is Stoic week and why would anybody want to celebrate the Stoics?\u201d Because I was under the\nmisunderstanding, as it turns out, that the Stoics are the kind of people that go through life with a stiff upper lip, trying to suppress emotions and stuff like that.\nBut I was curious. I remembered that one of the ancient Stoics was Marcus Aurelius,\nthe Roman Emperor, and I read the\u300aMeditations\u300bby Marcus Aurelius when I was in college. I liked it. Then I also remembered that another Stoic was Seneca who was a senator and advisor to the emperor Nero. I had translated Seneca from Latin when I was in high school. I thought, \u201cHey if these people were Stoics maybe I should look into Stoicism,\u201d which I did. I signed up for Stoic Week, actually, now I\u2019m one of the co-organizers of it. It immediately hit me as the right approach. The Stoics really came immediately to life for me. The philosophy resonated.\nOne of the very first Stoics that I studied was a guy named Epictetus. He started out his life as a slave \u2014 the lowest possible rank of society who eventually was freed and became in fact one of the most famous teachers of the early second century in Rome. And Epictetus has this really interesting no nonsense kind of approach \u2014 a delightful sense of humor, bordering on sarcasm. And so it's like: \u201cOkay, this is my guy. This is somebody who actually speaks to me.\u201d And ever since I started practicing and studying Stoicism, and here we are several years later, still talking about it.\nLu: What accounts for the growing interest in Stoicism in the world today?\nPigliucci: That's a good question. It's difficult to answer because there probably are multiple factors that eventually gave us this renaissance of Stoicism. My guess is that for one thing \u2014 especially in the Western world, there has been a decreasing interest in organized, official religion. But just because you move away from a religion that doesn't mean you don't need a spiritual aspect to your life and it doesn't mean that you don't need some kind of framework to navigate your life and to make decisions and so on and so forth. Religions are very good at that, but there are also philosophies that do essentially the same thing. I think that one reason for the interest not just in Stoicism but also in Eastern approaches, particularly Buddhism, over the last 10 or 20 years is the result of this need that has been unfulfilled recently by mainstream religions.\nThere are also other reasons for instance the rise of social media. As it turns out, social media as we all know have all sorts of drawbacks and problems but at the same time, they're also a very powerful channel of communication especially for small groups. And it turns out that Stoics organized themselves very well on social media. The largest group of Stoic practitioners on Facebook for instance counts almost 100,000 people. That's a significant number of people, and it's not the only one \u2014 there are several. So word kind of spreads in that way also.\nThere has also been a very concerted effort by what started with a small number of practitioners and scholars. Every year we have two events: STOICON which is a conference for people who are interested in Stoicism \u2014 this just happened a couple of weeks ago \u2014 and Stoic Week. The group that organizes that, which is called the Modern Stoicism of which now I am actually a part, started out meeting several years ago in a small room. Philosophers and scholars of ancient Stoicism along with\ncognitive behavioral therapists inspired by Stoicism were involved when it started out in the 2010s. All of these people just got together and said, \u201cHey! These are good techniques. This is a good approach. Maybe more people want to know about it,\u201d and so there kind of was a concerted effort to publicize Stoicism worldwide.\nLet's also remember that Stoicism just like other Greek philosophies itself originated about the 3rd or 4th century BC in a period where the Mediterranean world was going through major upheavals. The Hellenistic period goes from the death of Alexander the Great to the beginning of the Roman Empire. That was a period where major changes were happening in society, and people had no control over them. And that creates stress. When people are stressed and think things are outside of their control, then they need some kind of reference point. I think that we are going through something like that now. We have of course in last century just saw two world wars, which was a first. Even now we're facing an epidemic and climate change. At the global level, we're facing political upheaval in different parts of the world, but people feel pretty much the same way, and use the same tools. They go back to either religion or philosophy to achieve a sense of control and calm about events unfolding.\nLu: What do you believe is the relevance of Stoicism in business and life for entrepreneurs in today's world?\nPigliucci: That's an excellent question. Stoicism of course is a philosophy of life, which means that it doesn't apply just to business or specific aspects of one\u2019s life. It applies everywhere, just like a religion. It is not a religion, but it applies everywhere. You're not a part-time Christian or a part-time Buddhist. You are a Buddhist or Christian all the time, no matter what you're doing.\nSpecifically in terms of business, I think Stoicism has two things to recommend. One is that the general Stoic idea is we should live our life following virtue; that is, being helpful to other people. Trying to do the right thing no matter what the circumstances are, and particularly being helpful to what the Stoics call the human cosmopolis. That is the big large family of human beings; everybody is supposed to be treated as your brother or sister.\nNow in terms of business, that means that it's fine of course that you have to compete with others; it's fine that you have to respond to your shareholders and all that sort of stuff. But, you should always do it in a way that is in fact not hurtful to the human cosmopolis. If you are engaging in business practices, for instance, that are undermining the human cosmopolis, exploit people and make the situation on the planet worse, then you shouldn't do it. It's a kind of a moral compass that orients you away from certain kinds of practices and toward other kinds of practices, because for the Stoics, there's nothing wrong with being a businessman or doing any other job for that matter. But you always want to do it in a way that maintains the integrity of your character because the integrity of your character is the most precious thing that you have. You never compromise that if you can avoid it.\nThat's at a general level. At a practical level, there are several Stoic ideas that I think are helpful not only in business pretty much in any activity in life. And one of these ideas is sometimes referred to as the dichotomy of control. This is a notion that we actually find not just in Stoicism but also in Buddhism and in Christianity. Certain things are up to us and other things are not up to us \u2014 as Epictetus, the slave turned teacher that I mentioned before, said. Meaning that there are certain decisions and certain areas of life where we can make an impact and where we actually have control over the situation. And then there are others where we can't do much or anything at all.\nFor the Stoics, the wise person focuses on the first group. You focus where your agency is maximized, and where you can actually make a difference. For the rest \u2014 things that you do not control and things that are not really up to you, you try to develop an attitude of equanimity and serene acceptance.\nWhat does that mean? For instance, you are a business person and you are concerned with let's say, the quarterly profits of your company. That's a natural thing to be concerned about. But the profits \u2013 unfortunately, as far as the Stoics are concerned, are actually outside of your control. Your actions can influence your decision which in turn can influence how well your company is doing. But, ultimately, how well the company is doing depends on external factors such as competition from other companies, the worldwide economy, a pandemic, etcetera, which are definitely not under your control.\nAnd so you should train yourself to develop this attitude of serenity and acceptance: I\u2019m doing my best, but whatever happens I have to accept it because I don't really have a choice. However, you want to focus your efforts where you do have control.\nWhere is it that you have control? Well, in the judgments that you arrive that: the decisions you make about how to run the company or not to run the company. The kind of day-to-day decision-making that basically makes for most of what you do and most of what is efficacious for you. So you prepare yourself for the worst and accept whatever the outcome is but at the same time, you focus on where you can actually make decisions where you are in control. That is both best for your company in the long run because your focus where you are most effective, and also better for you psychologically because you retain a certain feeling of control of the situation as far as much as it is possible.\nFor Forbes China Chinese-language version, click here\nFor Forbes Greece version, click here\nSee related post:\nGreece Prime Minister Mistotakis Talks To Steve Forbes About Economic Recovery, China\n/rf\n@forbes_cn"

      "text": "Greece has more than 1,000 islands spread across the Aegean Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Culturally speaking, businessman Pavlos Kontomichalos has created what amounts to another small one in the cramped urban area of Shanghai\u2019s Changning district. \u201cI love Greece, and want to bring that feeling to China,\u201d says the long-time Shanghai dweller.\nKontomichalos\u2019 newly opened \u201cHellas House\u201d welcomes visitors with \u2013 what else \u2013 iconic ancient-style Greece pillars made from imported material. The structure is refurbished from an Italian-designed villa built in 1936 and later used by a Chinese state-owned company. Hellas House\u2019s grand opening on May 15 attracted Greece\u2019s tourism minister Elena Kountoura, who led a ribbon-cutting ceremony.\nThe interior highlights Greek culture. The five-level \u201cheritage mansion\u201d combines Shanghainese and Old Europe influences with distinctive design and ancient Greek art. The atmosphere beckons the visitor to indulge in the country\u2019s food, hospitality and travel. \u201cGreece is good at what comes from the land,\u201d said 57-year-old Kontomichalos. He hopes the facility will attract thought and business leaders, entrepreneurs, pioneers, legends and influencers from around the world.\nHellas House symbolizes the current era of close business ties between China and Greece. Chinese companies including Cosco, Huawei and Fosun Group have agreed to invest a total of $9 billion in the country in recent years. Cosco has a 30-year lease to operate the big port in the city of Piraeus.\nKontomichalos\u2019 idea for Hellas House was born during the financial crisis in Greece in 2010; it also came after nearly three decades of living and working away from his homeland. \u201cThere\u2019s an interesting dynamic: The more you are abroad, the more you love your country and you want to do something\u201d to help it, he said.\nHe had the means to do that after a successful career in the U.S. and China. Kontomichalos accepted a consumer marketing job at Bristol-Myers Squibb in Manhattan after graduating from Columbia University in New York in 1985. There, he became a marketing director for healthcare products, hair color products and other over-the-counter items. The company asked him to relocate to China in 1994 to add to an existing pharmaceuticals joint venture in Shanghai.\n\u201cThey said, \u2018We\u2019re like to start an over-the-counter products business in China -- a consumer products business. You\u2019re an adventurous guy. You have an accent. You\u2019ve traveled abroad. You\u2019ll be the general manager,\u2019\u201d he recalled with a chuckle.\nHe was ready for a change. \u201cThe U.S. market had matured, and were we fighting for market share points with Johnson & Johnson or Bayer or whoever. Here (in China), it was all about market creation. People didn\u2019t know yet what was over-the-counter, leaving the chance to help Chinese consumers learn that you can self-diagnose and use something that is safe and effective.\u201d\nAfter the Asian financial crisis struck in 1997 and wreaked havoc on the world economy, Kontomichalos thought he would be reassigned to another country. But Bristol-Myers once again offered him a new job \u2013 China president, with responsibilities that included the larger pharmaceuticals business. He accepted, and came up with plans to refocus and turnaround the business. He found success by 2000, but by then had been at Bristol-Myers for a decade and a half and was ready to start Profex, a company he co-founded with others from his old employer. Profex supplies skin-related products and medicine from brands including Mustela, Uriage Nen-Strata Bio-Oil and Korres.\n\u201cWe created a very unique model: MLO,\u201d standing for multinational products, local decision-making and staff ownership, he said. \u201cWhen you work at a multinational, the problem is slow decision-making. In China, if you don\u2019t move, things move on,\u201d he said. Kontomichalos said he told his staff, \u201cWe have to have a multinational way of thinking, but fast local decision-making, and ownership. Everyone has a chance to have ownership.\u201d The start-up later sold a stake to outsiders, allowing the earliest investors to partly cash out. The ex-Bristol Myers Squibb executive is still chairman and a shareholder.\nNewly enriched Kontomichalos decided to go in a new business direction, and came up with the idea to try to be a bridge between China and Greece. \u201cGreece was starting to have trouble\u201d in 2010, Kontomichalos recalled. \u201cI said, I\u2019m living in the most fascinating and dynamic place in the world, which I think is China, and Shanghai is the heart of China in many ways. I tried to find the best things that Greece has a competitive advantage in. It is products that come from the land because of the climate and the purity (of the environment), and the fact that Greece has limited industry. I decided to create a company around this concept. I created Hellas Group, which represents a way of thinking.\u201d\nKontomichalos and his wife Sophia identified and then invested in separate businesses in Greece and China that are linked to most of the products and services on offer at Hellas House: My Odyssey Travel is a luxury travel agency providing bespoke travel to Greece and Europe; Erosantorini is a year-round private estate on Santorini island, Elaion is an olive oil supplier, Tselepos supplies wine, Milos serves Greek food, Amphora is an import trading company, and How is a \u201cretail concept store\u201d that features natural Greek products including honey, olive oil, wines and cosmetics.\nInside Hellas House, Greek cuisine -- the heart of the Aegean lifestyle \u2013 is highlighted in a Elaion Open Kitchen, where, in addition to meals, cooking classes and seminars are also served up. The Dionysus Wine Cellar offers the largest selection of Greek regional wines in Shanghai and the outdoor Hellas House Eros Garden with a pool is envisioned as a venue for receptions, special occasions and corporate events. There\u2019s a Minoan Hall and the adjoining Aegean Lounge for aperitifs and digestifs, along with an Eros Lounge.\nKontomichalos and his architect Kostas Chatzigiannis knocked out fake low ceilings, removed office cubicles, and made other changes over a five-year period in upgrading the property while preserving its original interesting elements. \u201cThis is an old European architecture building in China, so we remain very faithful to that,\u201d said Chatzigiannis. \u201cThese are all original material and woods that you see. Apart from that, we tried to bring it up to modern standards. Then everything has been done in a way to represent different Greek styles as you pass from one room to another. The building remains true to itself, but overall, the visitors get a coherent feel.\u201d Greek influences include the Palace of King Minos in Crete.\nHellas House aims to operate as a club of global leaders for \u201cpeople that we qualify,\u201d Kontomichalos explained. \u201cI like to do things differently. To me, it\u2019s not the money. It\u2019s to mingle with the right people. I want people that I know or that my friends know or that acquaintances know that can learn from each other and inspire others. That\u2019s the concept.\u201d Those that find their way to Hellas House will likely find a graceful host and pleasant introduction to all things Greek.\n-Follow me at @rflannerychina"

      "text": "Forbes Media Chairman Steve Forbes and Greece President Kyriakos Mitsotakis were among the leaders to address the first-ever \u201cAncient Wisdom, Modern Compass\u201d dinner organized by Forbes China in Shanghai on Nov. 9 to help boost China-EU economic ties and highlight Greece as an investment, culture and business destination for Chinese businesses investment. Mitsotakis, who holds a Harvard MBA and had a career in business before entering politics, talked about the country\u2019s economic recovery after years of excessive debt, as well as its foundation for good relations with China. Excerpts from their video exchange follow.\nForbes: When you ran in 2019, you did something that is not always happening in Greek politics, and that is you achieved an absolute majority. You've mentioned some of the tax initiatives. Can you get some of the specifics that you did to reduce the corporate tax rate? You've also cut property taxes. Walk us through some of the specific things you did to help revive your economy.\nMitsotakis: First of all, I agree with you. The previous government thought that it was a wise policy to overtax the middle class. The end result was essentially leading the country onto a very low growth path and also rampant tax evasion. Higher taxes mean higher tax evasion. We've lowered the corporate tax rates from 28% to \u2014 more stabilized \u2014 22% percent with lower taxes on dividends from 15% to 5% with lower social security contributions.\nThe economy has responded very, very strongly. We've revised our growth forecast for the year to 6.1%. I wouldn't be surprised if growth will end up higher than that. But most importantly, we have a very realistic and healthy long-term growth forecast. And we did this without really placing too much burden on public finances. At the same time when we were lowering taxes, we also pushed hard to fight tax evasion. We have more electronic transactions now, so we have a much better understanding where tax evasion is actually taking place. And we have, also, as you pointed out, offered tax incentives for people who choose Greece as a permanent tax residence, and also for Greeks who choose to return from Greece (after) having spent a significant amount of their time abroad.\nForbes: One of the advantages Greece has compared to other countries \u2014 and a World Bank survey a couple of years ago highlighted this - is how relatively uncomplicated it is to start a business in Greece. You have one of the best rankings in the world. Walk us through that. What are some of the measures you're taking to make it easier to do business within Greece?\nMitsotakis: But we've made progress. We can do even better than that. One of the issues I want to highlight is digital transformation. This has probably been the biggest change in the day to day ability of Greeks, citizens, and also businesses to interact with the state. We're talking about millions of hours saved in terms of unnecessary interaction with the bureaucracy. There will always be regulatory burden when you talk about these types of (business) activities, but it\u2019s unnecessary for it to be excessive.\nForbes: Looking back on the last 10 years, Prime Minister, what do you think are the main lessons learned from the crisis that hit Greece would put the country in a terrible depression?\nMitsotakis: Where should I start? Let's say maybe two things. First of all, excessive austerity kills an economy. At the end of the day, you end up in a vicious cycle. Fiscal discipline is important, but I think clearly, we were pushed overboard in Greece. And the second lesson is don't ever trust (politicians) when they come with manifestos that we all know are too good to be true.\nForbes: China as we all know has the second largest economy in the world. It's a significant investor in Greece. We all know what happened to the Piraeus port. How do you assess relations with China right now? Two ancient civilizations, each trying to move ahead.\nMitsotakis: It\u2019s a complicated relationship. We are partners, we are rivals, we are competitors \u2014 all these things happened simultaneously. But on the win-win side of the equation, yes, China has made an important investment in the port of Piraeus, and they've significantly upgraded the port. China is a big trade partner for us \u2014 they're a big trade partner for everyone. When it comes to our cultural affinity, it is important. I think that two ancient civilizations can establish a dialogue that may be able to transcend the geopolitical tensions of the day. It is also particularly important from a practical point of view. The Chinese care a lot about culture. We have a lot of cultural sites that the Chinese visitors would be interested. So forging a closer cooperation when it comes to culture is also important.\nForbes: Do you see tourism fully recovering in 2022?\nMitsotakis: I do think tourism will fully recover in 2022. And the reason why I am optimistic is because it is particularly well in 2021. We started with relatively conservative projections. We did much better than we expected. I want make sure that we don't put too much stress on our most popular destinations. So we will be looking at destination management tools to make sure that we protect our more vulnerable ecosystems. We want to focus in high end sustainable tourism. I would prefer to welcome less tourists that spend more money than more tourists that spend less money in Greece.\nSee related post:\nForbes China, Hellas Group Team Up To Advance Business Between China And EU With Greece Focus\n\u2014Russell Flannery\n@forbes_cn"

  "argos_summary": "Italy and China, both cultural powerhouses, are increasingly collaborating in the winter sports sector, with Italy having a long-standing success in skiing and China rapidly growing its ski market post-2022 Winter Olympics. Italy aims to leverage this interest ahead of its hosting of the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano Cortina, seeking to attract Chinese tourists and promote bilateral business opportunities. Despite challenges such as competition and geopolitical tensions, Italian companies see potential in the Chinese market, particularly with the rising demands of the Chinese middle class for quality products.",
