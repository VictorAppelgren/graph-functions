  "title": "Mortgage Applications Today: Home Loan Demand Dips Despite Mortgage Rates Dropping to Lowest in 10 Months",
  "description": "People held back on applying for new mortgages despite rates dropping to a 10-month low, but there were other loans which benefitted.",
  "content": "The demand for home loans decreased 1.4% for the week ending Aug. 15, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. This dip comes after two straight weeks of mortgage applications increasing.\n\nThe decrease comes despite mortgage interest rates dropping to their lowest in 10 months. The average rate on a 30-year fixed home loan was 6.58% for the week ending Aug. 14, according to Freddie Mac. That number was down again, from 6.63% the prior week.\n\nThe seasonally adjusted purchase index increased 0.1% from the previous week. The unadjusted purchase index decreased 2% compared with the week prior and was 23% higher than the same week one year ago.\n\nFewer homeowners decided to refinance with the refinance share of mortgage activity decreasing to 46.1% of total applications from 46.5% one week earlier. The adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) share of activity decreased to 8.6% of total applications.\n\n\"Mortgage rates increased slightly last week, with the 30-year fixed rate now at 6.68 percent. Applications were down as a result, driven by a 16 percent decrease in VA applications, which are typically a volatile segment of the market,\" said Joel Kan, MBA's vice president and deputy chief economist.\n\nThe average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($806,500 or less) increased to 6.68% from 6.67%, with points decreasing to 0.60 from 0.64 (including the origination fee) for 80% loan-to-value ratio (LTV) loans. The effective rate remained unchanged from last week.\n\nThe average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with jumbo loan balances (greater than $806,500) decreased to 6.64% from 6.70%, with points increasing to 0.60 from 0.56 (including the origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. The effective rate decreased from last week.\n\nThe average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages backed by the FHA decreased to 6.39% from 6.40%, with points decreasing to 0.66 from 0.77 (including the origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. The effective rate decreased from last week.\n\nThe average contract interest rate for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages increased to 5.96% from 5.93%, with points increasing to 0.70 from 0.63 (including the origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. The effective rate increased from last week.\n\nThe average contract interest rate for 5/1 ARMs increased to 6.01% from 5.80%, with points decreasing to 0.63 from 0.67 (including the origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. The effective rate increased from last week.\n\n\"Purchase applications were little changed over the week but were at the strongest pace in four weeks and continued to run well ahead of last year's pace,\" says Kan. \"Prospective homebuyers remain more active compared to last year despite economic headwinds and uncertainty and affordability challenges.\"\n\nMortgage rates are calculated by various factors in the economy, and the length of your loan will also figure into the mortgage rate you qualify for.",
