  "title": "3 Creator Marketing Trends Shaping The Rest Of 2025",
  "description": "Whether it's in store aisles or on TV screens, creator content has become a powerful driver of discovery, trust and conversion.",
  "content": "Rodney Mason is Head of Marketing Brand Partnerships at LTK with extensive creator, marketing and research experience for leading brands.\n\nWorking with creators is no longer a bolt-on marketing tactic in digital commerce; creators are the strategy. As we move through the second half of 2025, I'm seeing three big creator-led trends transforming how consumers discover and how brands must respond to stay ahead. Whether it's in store aisles or on TV screens, creator content has become a powerful driver of discovery, trust and conversion.\n\n1. Creator-Generated Content Is The New Standard\n\nUser-generated content (UGC) was once the golden ticket to authenticity, but now, many consumers want trusted voices with taste, and that\u2019s where creators shine. Research from Matter Communications found that 69% of consumers trust recommendations from creators, alongside those from family and friends, more than branded content.\n\nShoppers now expect a personalized experience that feels authentic, relatable and tailored to their preferences. And creators are delivering.\n\nCreator content is also extending beyond digital. According to our recent study (download required), three in four consumers want to see creator content while they shop. They're engaging with creator content at nearly every step of the path to purchase, even inside the store. A staggering 92% of our platform users say they\u2019ve made an in-store purchase based on a creator\u2019s video, and they would prefer to engage with creator content in four key ways while shopping in store: looking up content on social media, checking brand websites in real time, scanning QR codes and viewing content on in-store tablets or signage.\n\nFor brands, this means that integrating creator content into the full shopping journey, both online and offline, is no longer optional. It\u2019s essential. Start by partnering with creators who authentically align with your audience, and then map their content to key decision moments like trending videos to spark discovery or a product demo in-person to bridge the gap between online and offline.\n\nA Pew Research Center study found that 83% of U.S. adults are now using streaming services, and a study by Shopsense AI and EMARKETER found that after being inspired by something on TV, almost three-fourths of viewers (registration required) search online and consider a purchase, make a purchase or do both.\n\nAs streaming platforms are becoming storefronts, creators can play a significant role in messaging. According to a Deloitte study, 49% of Gen-Z and 40% of Millennial consumers say they want to see their favorite online creators in TV shows and movies.\n\nSixty-one percent of our platform users report being influenced by trends they see on streaming shows, and then searching for and purchasing those items through creators. The connection between entertainment and commerce is accelerating, and creators are the bridge.\n\nThis shift presents a massive opportunity for brands: Integrating creator-led content into streaming and connected TV not only boosts visibility but also can build deeper emotional connections. As Gen-Zers increasingly rely on creators for recommendations, integrating creators into what they're watching feels more like a natural extension of entertainment than an ad, and that\u2019s where the magic happens.\n\nTo successfully integrate creator-led content into streaming and connected TV (CTV), start by identifying top-performing creators and content for your brand or category.\n\nOnce you've partnered with a creator, don\u2019t script the CTV spots. Instead, provide a brief that includes front- and back-end branded bumpers delivering the opening and closing, and allow the creator to deliver their message in their own voice, similar to their top-performing content. Or pull their top-performing content directly and edit it down into the spot format.\n\nOnce the spot is complete, align CTV to your audiences with characteristics similar to the creator's followers.\n\nEstablish a clear window with no CTV in advance of airing the spot for a period of time equivalent to the time the spot will run, and also provide a clear window with no spots for the same length of time as the CTV air dates. Compare performance during the run and the next period for engagement versus the initial clear window period.\n\n3. Welcome To The Era Of 'Me Media'\n\nToday\u2019s consumers aren't just looking for inspiration; they\u2019re looking for themselves in the content they consume. We found that 67% of our platform users return to search for the same creators again and again. Why? Because those creators reflect their style, preferences and even their zip code.\n\nThis hyper-personalized, identity-driven behavior is fueling what can be called the rise of \"me media\": content that reflects each consumer\u2019s personal style, values and daily life.\n\nThe connection between consumers and creators is increasingly local as well: 58% of Gen-Z consumers trust gift recommendations from local or micro-influencers.\n\nThe takeaway here? Relatability has become the new reach.\n\nWhat All This Means For Brands\n\nBrands that want to win in the second half of 2025 need to do more than just work with creators. They need to build and scale with creators, and embed them across multiple consumer touchpoints\u2014from creator collaboration campaigns to digital and social ads, streaming and CTV, audio and retail media network channels and in-store merchandising.\n\nTo do that, start identifying all touchpoints and assets across your complete customer journey. Then, work with creators to develop messaging to test in collaboration campaigns. Identify which creators and messages generate the best response and engagement. Once you\u2019ve identified the top performers, go back to those creators to expand the winning content across the customer journey in the correct formats and length, with the right messaging.\n\nAs we enter the busiest retail months of the year, creators aren\u2019t just influencing what\u2019s trending. They are the trend.\n\nis an invitation-only community for executives in successful public relations, media strategy, creative and advertising agencies.",

      "text": "Is streaming king? Most Americans (83%) say they watch streaming services, with Netflix and Amazon Prime Video being especially common. Far fewer \u2013 36% \u2013 say they currently subscribe to cable or satellite TV at home, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.\nStreaming use varies by age and income. But it\u2019s still relatively common across groups.\n- By age: About nine-in-ten adults under 50 ever watch programming on streaming services. But majorities of older adults do, too.\n- By income: Adults with higher incomes are most likely to watch streaming services. Still, about three-quarters or more of those with middle or lower incomes do the same.\nWhile most adults are current streaming users, another 7% have used streaming services in the past. Just 10% have never used streaming services.\nBelow, we look more closely at:\n- Streaming, cable or both?\n- What streaming platforms are people watching?\n- Are streaming services seen as worth the cost?\n- Are people sharing passwords?\n- How likely are people to use streaming services in the future?\nStreaming, cable or both?\nStreaming\u2019s rise has also prompted conversations about \u201ccord-cutting\u201d and the future of cable.\nCompared with those who watch streaming, far fewer Americans (36%) say they subscribe to cable or satellite TV at home. Americans ages 65 and older are most likely to say they subscribe to cable or satellite, at 64%. Smaller shares of those 50 to 64 (44%), 30 to 49 (23%) and 18 to 29 (16%) say the same.\nStill, 28% of Americans both subscribe to cable or satellite TV and watch streaming services. Another 55% watch streaming but do not also have a cable or satellite subscription.\nIn addition, 8% of Americans subscribe to cable or satellite TV but don\u2019t watch streaming services. And another 8% neither subscribe to cable or satellite nor watch streaming services.\nWhat streaming platforms are people watching?\nAs new streaming platforms continuously emerge, Americans have a wealth of options. We asked about nine of them in the survey.\nNetflix and Amazon Prime Video are the most widely used of the streaming platforms we asked about. Some 72% say they ever watch programming on Netflix, and a slightly smaller share (67%) say this about Amazon Prime Video.\nBy comparison:\n- About half of Americans say they use Hulu (52%) or Disney+ (48%).\n- 44% say they use Paramount+.\n- 41% say they use Peacock or Max.\n- Fewer say they use Apple TV+ (25%) or ESPN+ (21%).\n(The April survey asked about \u201cMax, formerly known as HBO Max.\u201d In May, its parent company announced plans to change the name back to HBO Max.)\nBy age\nFor nearly every platform we asked about, adults under 50 are more likely than those 50 and up to use it. And those 65 and older often stand out further as being least likely to do so.\nFor example, 80% of adults under 30 and 81% of those 30 to 49 use Netflix, compared with 70% of those 50 to 64 and 53% of those 65 and older.\nOn two platforms, the youngest age groups differ from each other:\n- 18- to 29-year-olds stand out on Hulu: 72% use this service, versus 60% of those 30 to 49, 48% of those 50 to 64, and 29% of those 65 and older.\n- 30- to 49-year-olds stand out on Amazon Prime Video: 78% use it, versus 67% of those 18 to 29, 70% of those 50 to 64, and 50% of those 65 and up.\nThe exception to these patterns is ESPN+, which adults of all ages are about equally likely to use.\nAre streaming services seen as worth the cost?\nOn balance, streaming users are relatively satisfied with the content they watch. Four-in-ten users say they are extremely or very satisfied. Half say they are somewhat satisfied, and 10% say they are not too or not at all satisfied.\nAt the same time, rising subscription fees have drawn widespread attention.\nThe largest share of users (44%) say the streaming services they use are worth the cost, while 31% say they\u2019re not. And 25% aren\u2019t sure.\nAre people sharing passwords?\nSome streaming platforms have cracked down on password sharing in recent years.\nWe find 26% of streaming users say they use the password to a streaming service from someone outside their household.\nYounger adults are particularly likely to do this. About half of streaming users under 30 (47%) say they use someone else\u2019s password, compared with 26% of users 30 to 49 and 15% of those 50 and up.\nHow likely are people to use streaming services in the future?\nFinally, we asked people how likely they are to watch programming on streaming services in the next year \u2013 regardless of whether they currently do.\nOverall, 65% of Americans say they\u2019re extremely or very likely to use streaming services in the next year. Another 19% say they\u2019re somewhat likely to do this, and 15% say they\u2019re not too or not at all likely.\nBut views differ based on whether they currently use these services:\n- 76% of streaming users say they\u2019re extremely or very likely to watch these services in the next year. Another 19% are somewhat likely and 4% are not too or not at all likely.\n- 10% of those who don\u2019t use streaming services say they\u2019re extremely or very likely to do so in the next year, 20% are somewhat likely, and 70% are not too or not at all likely.\nNote: Here are the questions used for this analysis, the topline and the survey methodology."

      "text": "People still want the TV and movie experience offered by traditional studios, but social platforms are becoming competitive for their entertainment time\u2014and even more competitive for the business models that studios have relied on. Social video platforms offer a seemingly endless variety of free content, algorithmically optimized for engagement and advertising. They wield advanced ad tech and AI to match advertisers with global audiences, now drawing over half of US ad spending.1 As the largest among them move into the living room, will they be held to higher standards of quality?\nAt the same time, the streaming on-demand video (SVOD) revolution has fragmented pay TV audiences, imposed higher costs on studios now operating direct-to-consumer services, and delivered thinner margins for their efforts. It can be a tougher business, yet the premium video experience offered by streamers often sets the bar for quality storytelling, acting, and world-building. How can studios control costs, attract advertisers, and compete for attention? Are there stronger points of collaboration that can benefit both streamers looking to reach global audiences and social platforms that lack high-quality franchises?\nThis year\u2019s Digital Media Trends lends data to the argument that video entertainment has been disrupted by social platforms, creators, user-generated content (UGC), and advanced modeling for content recommendations and advertising. Such platforms may be establishing the new center of gravity for media and entertainment, drawing more of the time people spend on entertainment and the money that brands spend to reach them.\nOur survey of US consumers reveals that media and entertainment companies\u2014including advertisers\u2014are competing for an average of six hours of daily media and entertainment time per person (figure 1). And this number doesn\u2019t seem to be growing.2 Not only is it unlikely that any one form of media will command all six hours, but each user likely has a different mix of SVOD, UGC, social, gaming, music, podcasts, and potentially other forms of digital media that make up these entertainment hours.\nComplete a brief survey to provide your views on thought leadership content.\nLooking across generations, preferences among respondents appear to be shifting away from pay TV and toward streaming video services, social video platforms, and gaming. Although TV once dominated video entertainment time, we now see US audiences\u2014and especially younger generations\u2014engaging more evenly with SVOD companies, social platforms, gaming, and even audio entertainment like music and podcasts. And they are using different devices to consume media (figure 2).\nThis can further fragment the landscape of entertainment and make it more challenging for services and brands to reach audiences, and for providers to gather more people onto their services. With growing production and marketing costs, traditional studios and streamers are responding with more bundles and aggregations seeking to bring together disparate audiences, offer them lower prices for multiple services, and sell access to advertisers.3\nMedia and entertainment companies may also be competing for a fixed amount of entertainment spending. We do not see those surveyed spending more money on subscriptions, and many report fatigue with having to manage multiple subscriptions to get the content they want, and frustrations with rising subscription prices. The median household annual income in the United States is about US$80,000 and is only now rebounding from COVID-19 pandemic declines that began in 2020.4 At the same time, consumer prices have climbed for most goods.5 In Deloitte\u2019s January 2025 ConsumerSignals survey, about half of US households say they have no money left over at the end of the month after meeting their expenses.6 This can shift the household calculus to prioritize spending on essentials over discretionary entertainment. Twenty years ago, many households may have considered pay TV an essential cost. Since then, the number of digital entertainment options has grown significantly, but the amount of time and money available for it have not. This has enabled greater consumer choice, more competition, and more fragmentation.\nCable and satellite television7 remain significant players in media and entertainment, though subscriptions continue to decline. We found that 49% of consumers surveyed currently have a cable or satellite TV subscription, down from 63% three years ago.8 The primary reasons subscribers report paying for these services are to watch live news (43%) and sports (41%). However, the market continues to fall, likely because SVOD services now offer more live sports options, and social media provides free sports clips and news recaps.\nOlder generations are more likely to maintain cable or satellite TV subscriptions, but 23% of Generation Z and 18% of millennial cable subscribers intend to terminate their subscriptions within the next 12 months, compared to only 8% of boomers.\nCost is likely a factor for these younger subscribers looking to cancel: Subscribers report spending an average of $125 per month on their cable or satellite TV subscriptions, which is significantly higher than the $69 on average subscribers report spending for four paid streaming services combined, according to our Digital Media Trends data. Subscribers also feel frustration with the number, and quality, of ads they\u2019re required to watch at this higher price point.9\nLive-streaming TV services offer an alternative, are slightly more popular with younger generations surveyed, and live-streaming TV subscribers in our survey report spending 35% less monthly on average for these services than cable or satellite subscriptions, but their growth has stagnated at around 40% of households for the past two years.10 A likely challenge is that these services tend to cost more than ad-free SVOD services, with pricing that seems to target existing pay TV subscribers accustomed to such costs, rather than younger generations gravitating to much cheaper\u2014 or free\u2014media alternatives.11\nAlthough cable and satellite subscriptions are falling, and live-streaming TV subscriptions appear stagnant, some in younger generations still show interest in live programming: Forty-three percent of Gen Z and millennials surveyed indicate a willingness to pay more for streaming video subscriptions that include access to live sports, although their engagement with live content remains to be seen. When asked about the types of content they spend the most time watching on SVOD, 27% of consumers said live sports, and just 8% said live events like music concerts. This may be due to a lack of options for those categories on SVOD, along with the ability to watch this content in other places: a third of Gen Z respondents say they don\u2019t subscribe to an SVOD service to watch sports because they watch the clips and highlights on social media.\nOne challenge is that traditional studios still draw considerable revenues from their pay TV businesses.12 As they bring advertising to their streaming services, they may be hoping to migrate those pay TV ad revenues along with their audiences. However, global ad revenues for TV, including streaming video, are expected to see slow growth of around 2.4% in coming years, significantly less than overall advertising.13\nA similar tension seems to exist with streaming video services, which have subscription costs that may outweigh their perceived value. Fifty-three percent of consumers surveyed say their SVOD subscriptions are the paid media and entertainment services they use most frequently. However, 41% percent of consumers overall say the content available on SVOD isn\u2019t worth the price, up five percentage points from our 2024 report.14 At the same time, roughly half (47%) of consumers say they pay too much for the streaming services they use, suggesting there is an imbalance between cost and perceived value. Indeed, while the average number of paid SVOD services has remained the same, at four per subscribing household, the overall cost subscribers surveyed say they pay has gone up 13% in the past year, from an average of $61 per month to $69. Gen Z and millennials, with an average of 5 paid SVOD services, have seen a 20% increase (figure 3).\nCurrently, the average price for a premium, ad-free SVOD service subscription is around $16 per month, though the leading services can be significantly higher.15 However, according to Digital Media Trends data, consumers surveyed say that $14 is \u201cjust the right price\u201d to pay for an ad-free subscription to their favorite SVOD service, with $25 being deemed too expensive (figure 4).\nKeeping in mind that not all SVOD services on the market have the same pricing power,16 the current average SVOD price is inching toward a critical price threshold, beyond which subscribers may be unwilling to pay. Respondents say that a price hike of $5 would make the majority (60%) of them likely to cancel their favorite SVOD service. Even their favorite services may be getting too expensive for the value, though it seems that so far, a few leading services have been able to raise prices significantly without losing subscribers. This can put more pressure on smaller services with less pricing power.\nThese rising service costs and widespread price sensitivities may be contributing to persistent\u2014and high\u2014SVOD churn rates among consumers. According to the survey, 39% of consumers say they have cancelled at least one paid SVOD service in the last six months (the measurement for churn)\u2014a number that has remained relatively stable for the past several years.17 However, these churn numbers jump to above 50% for both Gen Zs and millennials who are also more likely to be strong social media users and gamers. Churn and return\u2014or the percentage of consumers who have cancelled a service only to renew that same service in the past six months\u2014also remains stable at 24%.\nService cancellations are problematic for streaming video on-demand companies that have been dependent on subscription revenues to support their costs, especially given the costs of acquiring\u2014and possibly re-acquiring\u2014subscribers. Some are bundling with other service providers to add value and lower subscriber costs, including creative bundles that tie SVOD services to less discretionary household spending.18 Many of the top streaming video providers are also launching ad-supported subscriptions, shifting their businesses more towards advertisers looking to reach large audiences. However, this may be leading them into more challenging territory.\nStudios are not only competing for attention time\u2014those six hours per day\u2014and for subscription fees, but they\u2019re also increasingly competing for advertising dollars. To curb outright cancellations, cast a wider net of subscribers, and generate revenues, some major SVOD services have introduced ad-supported tiers. These tiers offer cheaper subscription prices, but in exchange, users must watch advertisements. More than half of SVOD subscribers (54%) surveyed say that at least one of the services they pay for is ad-supported, a number that\u2019s increased by eight percentage points since our 2024 report (figure 5).19 The average monthly cost for the ad-supported tiers currently on the market sits at around US$9,20 which is on par with the price respondents say is just right to pay (US$10) in exchange for watching eight minutes of ads per hour.\nAdditionally, we found that more than two-thirds of younger generations subscribe to a free ad-supported TV service\u2014streaming video services that are free to watch and fully subsidized by advertising. We also found that most respondents believe there is too much repetition of ads on streaming video services and cable.\nStudios may hope they can migrate pay TV ad dollars to their streaming services, and that cheaper ad-supported tiers will make it easier to acquire and retain subscribers. However, the advertising landscape\u2014and ad tech especially\u2014is more mature outside of pay TV, and most digital ad dollars are now going to social platforms.21\nOnce again, the technological advantage that social platforms have built becomes apparent. Gen Zs (63%), followed by millennials (49%), are much more likely to say that ads or product reviews on social media are most influential to their purchasing decisions. Ads on streaming video services are a distant second (28% and 25%, respectively) (figure 6). Additionally, 54% of these younger generations surveyed say that social media ads are more relevant to them than those on streaming video services or cable TV.\nLeading social platforms are optimized for advertising, leveraging the same engines they use to deliver more relevant content to users, buoyed by accelerating spending on artificial intelligence. We found that a majority of Gen Zs and millennials surveyed say they get better recommendations for TV shows and movies from social media than from streaming video services. Social platforms can also make it easy for advertisers to buy ads and target specific cohorts with clear results.22 While traditional studios have spent heavily on streaming distribution and premium content, social platforms have been investing in data-driven personalization for both content creators and advertisers.23\nGiven these trends, it may be unsurprising that 56% of Gen Zs and 43% of millennials surveyed report that social media content is more relevant to them than traditional content like TV shows and movies (figure 7). Gen Zs lead the trend: These respondents spend 54% more time\u2014or about 50 minutes more\u2014than the average consumer per day on social platforms and watching UGC; and 26% less time\u2014or about 44 minutes less per day\u2014than the average person watching TV and movies.\nA draw toward social video platforms is the creators themselves. A majority of those in the younger generations we surveyed say creators\u2019 videos are their favorite types of videos on social media. But perhaps more salient: Roughly 50% of Gen Zs and millennials surveyed say they feel a stronger personal connection to social media creators than they do with TV personalities or actors. Fans of creators often form parasocial relationships, which ups their investment and keeps them scrolling.24 For younger generations especially, trending social videos are often like the new hit TV shows and creators are the new reality stars..\nThis highlights another competitive twist. Top studios are spending more than ever to produce content for their services.25 Yet video content is increasingly being produced by independent creators and consumed on social platforms. Creators work for themselves, the platforms have options of how to incentivize them, and audiences get the content for free from algorithms designed for attention and engagement. Social platforms are extending generative AI tools to help creators run their businesses, create content, target audiences and advertisers, and match with brand sponsors.26 Creators offer more credibility and authenticity to brands and advertisers who may be trying to reach the millions who follow an influencer or the thousands who follow a trusted niche creator.27\nDespite (and sometimes because of) their success, some creators have made the leap to network television or major streaming video platforms\u2014where they can secure lucrative and stable contracts, get more exposure, and grow their audiences. This approach is met with mixed reviews: Some consumers surveyed say they\u2019d be more willing to watch TV shows or movies starring their favorite creators (29% of consumers overall), while others say that creators lose the authenticity they had on social media when they\u2019re featured on TV shows (30% of consumers overall) (figure 8).\nIt\u2019s worth noting, too, that this cross-medium success can work in both directions. That is, consumers surveyed say they often follow reality stars or athletes on social media after seeing them on a reality show or playing in a game\u2014a behavior that is common for around 40% of both Gen Zs and millennials. In the same way that creators are amplifying their fame in TV and movies, more traditional celebrities are establishing themselves as brands, and amassing followings, on social media.\nThese last points suggest a deeper cultural shift: The definition and value of \u201ccelebrity\u201d seem to be changing. Younger generations are spending more time on social platforms engaging with independent content creators who may seem more familiar and authentic, and spending less time with traditional celebrities who may seem distant, mainstream, and inauthentic.\nThe costs of producing and distributing TV and films continue to go up, while the revenue they generate has gone down.28 The majority of advertising now goes to social platforms and hyperscale competitors\u2014a handful of global, trillion-dollar companies with multiple lines of business and the most advanced AI capabilities available.29 Meanwhile, more studios are separating their pay TV businesses for potential divestiture, and focusing on their \u201ccore\u201d business: intellectual property (IP) and streaming.30 Yet, the content and ad engines on most streaming video services are not yet mature, nor do they have the scale of data and expertise that has been acquired by social platforms. Accordingly, more studios are now working to advance their ad tech capabilities.31 And, some studios are beginning to distribute their programming on top of social video platforms. This could benefit both parties.32 Studios can learn from social platforms about content creativity and advertising capabilities, while platforms can benefit from the premium storytelling that is the strength of studios.\nYet, they\u2019re all vying for a share of those six hours of daily entertainment time. This sharpens the new competitive landscape: Traditional studios face new competitors that are much larger than nearly all traditional TV and film studios combined.33 Leading social video platforms measure their global audiences and the hours of video viewed each day in the billions.34 And they dominate global advertising.35 If studios haven\u2019t yet embraced this new reality, they face an imperative to change: Engagement with these platforms is eroding time spent on streaming TV and movies.36\nSome traditional studios have been squeezing everything they can from their pay TV ad revenues, carefully migrating IP to their streaming services, spending on content to compete with other studios, and trying to get audiences and advertisers to make the journey with them. Bundles, especially with more essential and fixed services, and reaggregation of audiences to sell to advertisers might help.37 Some are building ad platforms that combine multiple streamers into one addressable ad market, hoping to make it easier and more cost-effective for advertisers to reach their audiences.38\nGood TV can be touching and engrossing. Good cinema can be deeply impactful and moving. There is still value and demand for premium video content, but the economics likely need to be reset. Production costs are high and production times long. Fewer shows and films get produced and far fewer become big enough to cover their costs.39 This can make creativity risky: The safety of known successes is often preferred.\nAt the same time, many households are under financial pressure. Adding another paid subscription is not trivial. It likely either needs to deliver real ongoing value to justify the cost or the cost needs to come down. The former path requires more spending on content, and the latter more spending on advertising solutions. At a time when studios are looking to cut costs, facing the competition with social video is likely going to require significantly more spending.\nStudios should consider the following.\nIt may be that only hyperscale and diversified media companies can compete in the new landscape. Strong studio streamers\u2014only a handful\u2014are global, data-powered, and AI-enabled and may operate multiple other lines of profitable businesses. Should smaller studios downsize and sell content to the winners? Should they entice influencers and produce more content for social platforms? Or come together to form more competitive and capitalized alliances? At the minimum, studios will likely need to aggregate larger addressable audiences and secure much better ad tech.\nThe deeper challenge may be about mindsets. Traditional studios and streamers still seem organized around the same concepts and business models of TV and film that shaped entertainment for many decades. But costs and risk have narrowed cinema to very expensive and safe franchises, and if studios asked kids and teenagers what they think about the future of TV, they might answer, \u201cWhat\u2019s TV?\u201d\nThese insights are based on an online survey of 3,595 US consumers that was conducted in October 2024. Throughout this report, we reference generations. Our generational definitions are as follows: Generation Z (1997-2010), millennial (1983\u20131996), Generation X (1966\u20131982), boomers (1947-1965), and matures (1946 and prior). The survey was fielded by an independent research firm, and all data is weighted back to the most recent Census to give a representative view of US consumers."
