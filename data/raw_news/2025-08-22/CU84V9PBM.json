  "description": "New TechWoven case may be just weeks away",
  "content": "Apple's FineWoven cases for the iPhone 15 (above) are now discontinued, but it looks like they'll be getting TechWoven successors according to new leaks.\n\u2022 Apple might launch a new case to replace the discontinued FineWoven\n\u2022 The new case is reportedly made from textured fabric\n\u2022 It will come in several colors and might work with a \u201cCrossbody Strap\u201d\n\nWhen Apple launched the iPhone 15 series, it also revealed a new case dubbed FineWoven that it said was better for the environment than leather alternatives. Yet this case proved to be a disaster, with a flood of complaints over its appearance and a lack of durability. Still, that apparently hasn\u2019t put Apple off from finding a replacement, with a new leak seemingly revealing the protective case that the company could launch alongside the iPhone 17 later this year.\n\nIn a post on their website, leaker Majin Bu has published what they claim are photos of an upcoming FineWoven successor called TechWoven. This shows the full range of colors that the case will apparently come in, including green, orange, black, navy blue, and purple. As with FineWoven \u2013 which was made from a \u201cmicrotwill\u201d fabric \u2013 Bu says TechWoven \u201cremains a fabric cover, but the material has been redesigned for greater durability and more practical daily use.\u201d\n\nBu says this takes the form of a \u201cslightly textured weave,\u201d and their photos show a dimpled effect when viewed up close. Crucially, the leaker alleges that the case surface \u201cmaintains a consistent appearance even after weeks of use.\u201d If true, that might address one of the key criticisms of FineWoven, which often seemed to deteriorate in appearance after a period of sustained usage.\n\nThe cases will also feature metallic buttons, cutouts for lanyard bands, MagSafe compatibility, and an integrated Camera Control cover, the post contends. There will supposedly be options for every model in the iPhone 17 range, including the iPhone 17 Air.\n\nThis is not Majin Bu\u2019s first TechWoven revelation. Just two days ago, the leaker posted images of what they claimed was packaging for the TechWoven case. Before that, they uploaded an image of a single TechWoven case on X, although they noted that it was a clone rather than one made by Apple, suggesting that the cases in Bu\u2019s latest post might also be clones.\n\nInterestingly, the packaging recently revealed by Majin Bu contained the phrase \u201cCompatible with Crossbody Strap.\u201d Apple does not sell any products under that name, but iPhone accessory maker OtterBox does. With the TechWoven case supposedly including lanyard cutouts, that could indicate that Apple has made it compatible with OtterBox\u2019s accessory. Alternatively, Apple might be planning to sell its own product called Crossbody Strap, perhaps as a security feature to thwart snatching thieves.\n\nReactions to the TechWoven case rumors have so far been mixed. On Reddit, the top comment on a post linking to coverage of the TechWoven case was a succinct \u201cthat\u2019s a no from me\u201d, with many of the complaints citing Apple's traditionally high prices for its own-brand accessories. Many also noted missing the quality of Apple's early leather cases around the time of the iPhone 8 and iPhone X.\n\nHowever, the responses under Majin Bu\u2019s latest X post were more positive, so it remains to be seen if TechWoven can succeed where FineWoven failed.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that the FineWoven debacle was a stumble for Apple, and while there were still plenty of people who liked the cases, the overwhelming sentiment was one of negativity. That means Apple is under pressure to do better this time around. With just a few weeks until the iPhone 17 launch date, we should soon find out if these rumored TechWoven cases can put things right.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 There\u2019s more proof Apple will kill off its FineWoven cases at today's iPhone 16 event\n\u2022 The end of FineWoven? Apple reportedly stops production of the eco-friendly accessories\n\u2022 Apple could be killing off an entire line of iPhone accessories after just one year",

      "text": "iPhone 17: latest news and rumors for every expected model\nThe iPhone 16 line landed a while back now, so unsurprisingly there are numerous iPhone 17 leaks at this point \u2013 some of which emerged even before the launch of Apple\u2019s latest phones.\nAs such \u2013 even though we\u2019re not expecting the iPhone 17 and its siblings to launch before September 2025 \u2013 we already have some idea of what to expect from these phones. That includes camera upgrades, yet another new button, better screens, and even an entire new model.\nBelow then, you\u2019ll find full details of all the credible leaks and rumors we\u2019ve heard so far, and we\u2019ll be updating this article whenever we hear anything new.\nCut to the chase\n- What is it? The next flagship iPhone\n- When is it out? Possibly September 9\n- How much will it cost? Likely upwards of $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,399\nA predictable release date\n- Likely to be announced in the first half of September\n- A leak points to September 9\n- Could start at upwards of $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,399\nThere aren\u2019t many iPhone 17 release date rumors yet, but we don\u2019t really need any, as Apple tends to follow a highly predictable pattern.\nAs such, based on past form we predict that the iPhone 17 will be announced in the first half of September 2025. Typically Apple announces the device on a Tuesday or Wednesday, but the company broke with that pattern for the iPhone 16 and used a Monday, so we aren\u2019t totally confident of the exact day.\nThat said, Apple more often uses the second week of the month, so it could be announced sometime between Monday, September 8, and Friday, September 12, with September 8, 9, or 10 being most likely based on the weekdays Apple usually goes with. Indeed, Apple watcher Mark Gurman has now made a similar prediction for the iPhone 17 release date.\nSince then, a leak has pointed to September 9 as the announcement date, with September 19 apparently being when these phones will ship.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIn any case, the phones will likely go up for pre-order on the Friday of their announcement week (meaning probably Friday September 12 or failing that September 5 if our guesses are right), and then ship on the following Friday, which would probably be September 19 as leaked above but could be September 12.\nAs for the price, most of the leaks there so far are for a new model possibly dubbed the iPhone 17 Slim or iPhone 17 Air (more on which below), but a report suggests this slimmer iPhone 17 model could have a starting price of $1,299 (about \u00a31,000 / AU$1,950).\nWe would however take that with a pinch of salt, as that would be a higher price than the current top iPhone, and some other leaks suggest this would be positioned more in the middle of the pack.\nIndeed, more recently we've heard that the iPhone 17 Air could cost less than the iPhone 17 Pro, with the latest leak pointing to a starting price of $899 for the iPhone 17 Air, which would see it match the iPhone 16 Plus. That's a claim we've now heard multiple times. Whatever it costs though, it's predicted that the iPhone 17 Air might not be a massive hit.\nIn any case, we can look at previous pricing for possible starting prices of the other models. The iPhone 16 then starts at $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,399, the iPhone 16 Plus starts at $899 / \u00a3899 / AU$1,599, the iPhone 16 Pro starts at $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,799, and the iPhone 16 Pro Max starts at $1,199 / \u00a31,199 / AU$2,149, so successors to these models are likely to cost at least this much.\nHowever, the earliest iPhone 17 pricing leak suggests they might cost more, and with President Trump threatening 25% tariffs on Apple, there's a growing chance the prices could increase. Indeed, more recent iPhone 17 price leaks point in the same direction, with an increase of around $50 (roughly \u00a340 / AU$75) now looking likely.\nAnother leak has also now pointed to a $50 price hike for the iPhone 17 Pro specifically, but has added that it could at least start with 256GB of storage, rather than the 128GB of the current model. That leaker has since reiterated this claim.\nCan you trust these rumors?\nThe claim that the iPhone 17 Air could have the same price as the iPhone 16 Plus is believable, though with potential tariffs it's hard to be sure. In any case, the release date for all these phones will very likely be in September.\nA new model\n- An iPhone 17 Air rather than a Plus model\n- Also expect an iPhone 17, an iPhone 17 Pro, and an iPhone 17 Pro Max\nYou won\u2019t be surprised to hear that we\u2019re expecting an iPhone 17, an iPhone 17 Pro, and an iPhone 17 Pro Max, but what about the iPhone 17 Plus? Well, while that\u2019s a possibility, several leaks have suggested that there might be a slimmer and more expensive iPhone 17 Air or iPhone 17 Slim instead.\nHowever, a reputable analyst predicts that the iPhone 17 Air won't be any more popular than the company's Plus and mini models.\nThere\u2019s also an outside chance that we\u2019ll see an iPhone 17 Ultra, either instead of or as well as the iPhone 17 Pro Max. This would be an ultra-premium model that would sit at the top of the line. But that\u2019s seeming less likely, as it\u2019s not something that\u2019s been leaked much recently, though claims of an Ultra model still occasionally emerge.\nClaims of an iPhone 17 Air though have arrived with more frequency, and from a number of reputable sources, so there\u2019s every chance we could see a super-slim iPhone in 2025.\nIn fact, the latest leaks point to the iPhone 17 Air measuring even thinner than the competition, namely the recently-announced Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, at a possible thickness of just 5.44mm. That's even thinner than an unfolded Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nWhat's more, the iPhone 17 Air is tipped to get Apple's new C1 modem, revealed with the iPhone 16e, unlike the base model iPhone 17.\nCan you trust these rumors?\nNumerous reputable sources have pointed to an iPhone 17 Air or iPhone 17 Slim, so we'd think this is likely to make an appearance, though what it will actually be called is less clear, and we wouldn't count on seeing an iPhone 17 Ultra.\nA new button\n- A 120Hz screen for all four models\n- A new button in place of the Action and volume buttons\n- A new display technology for the Pro models\nOne of the more intriguing iPhone 17 design leaks we've heard is that the iPhone 17 Pro and possibly other models could have another new button \u2013 this time a single button that would replace the Action button and both volume keys.\nDetails of this possible button are limited, but it\u2019s easy to imagine it could work like the Camera Control key, allowing you to swipe to change the volume, and press it to launch an app or feature of your choice. Perhaps it would even accept both light and strong presses to launch different things.\nApple has actually experimented with unified solid-state volume buttons in the past, including on an iPhone 14 Pro prototype, so it's possible the idea is being resurrected for the iPhone 17 series.\nAnd in a less likely leak, we\u2019ve heard that Apple could equip some or all iPhone 17 models with under-display Face ID.\nOne other source has leaked three possible iPhone 17 Pro colors, namely Dark Green Titanium, Teal Titanium, and Green Titanium. Apparently only one of these will be used if any, and of these it's the Teal Titanium they suspect is most likely to be used. That's the middle shade in the leaked image below. That said, we suspect all three of these are brighter than Apple would opt for.\nIndeed, they can't seem to make up their mind as to which new color or colors we might see, as they've more recently claimed Sky Blue is the most likely new iPhone 17 Pro shade, and also previously pointed to Titanium Blue or Titanium Purple shades.\nThe same source has since said that the standard iPhone 17 could come in a purple or green shade, and that the iPhone 17 Air might be sold in black, silver, light blue, and light gold shades.\nThere's disagreement on colors though, as we've elsewhere heard that the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will be sold in Orange, Dark Blue, Gray, Black, and Silver, as you can see in the render below. That orange shade has been shown off on video, to very mixed reactions.\nAnother iPhone 17 Pro colors leak also points in that direction, while elsewhere we've seen that there could be a brown iPhone 17 Pro rather than an orange one. That latter leak also points to black, white, pink, blue, and green shades for the iPhone 17, and black, white, blue, and a pale yellow for the iPhone 17 Air.\nIn any case, you might be able to get a 'TechWoven' case for your iPhone, and these seemingly come in green, orange, black, navy blue, and purple.\nIn another leak, we've heard that all four iPhone 17 models could have an aluminum frame, which would be a change for the Pro models, as the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max use more premium titanium.\nSo that seems an odd shift, and the report adds that in the case of the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max the top half of the back will also be aluminum, with the bottom half sticking as glass, and the camera bump being larger than on current models.\nHowever, another leak has since refuted this, saying the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will stick with titanium frames.\nSince then, we've heard that the iPhone 17 series could use the frame pictured below, which could make for a Pixel 9-like design, and somewhat lines up with the leak above mentioning an aluminum top half and a larger camera bump.\nWe've seen a similar design in iPhone 17 series dummy units and even a leaked iPhone 17 Pro photo, and yet another source has also similarly claimed that the iPhone 17 Pro (and probably the other models) will have the design shown below.\nThis source has also shared the possible design of the iPhone 17 Air, as you can see below.\nIt has a very slim build but a quite large camera block considering there's just one lens on the back. So we'd take it with a pinch of salt, though it does line up with another iPhone 17 Air design leak.\nThe same source has also claimed that the standard iPhone 17 will have the same camera design as the iPhone 16, so that model might not get this new camera bar.\nOther leakers have since backed up these claims, with multiple sets of iPhone 17 dummy units being leaked, showing similar designs, which we've seen numerous times now, and it's a design that people don't seem keen on so far. In fact, Google has even made fun of it.\nHowever, more recent iPhone 17 Pro dummy unit photos show a far more refined version of this design, and one that should be easier to like.\nSome smaller design changes could be planned too, with one source suggesting that some or all iPhone 17 models will have curvier sides than their predecessors.\nWe\u2019ve also elsewhere heard that the iPhone 17 Pro Max could have a narrower Dynamic Island than the current model, which is a claim that has now come up more than once, and that conflicting with one of the leaks above it will have a titanium frame, while the other models will apparently have a \u201cmore complex\u201d aluminum shell, which may be a reference the the half metal, half glass rear leaked above. Multiple sources have now pointed to a smaller Dynamic Island, though one source says the Dynamic Island will stay the same.\nAnother source has similarly said that the front of the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will look similar to the iPhone 16 Pro, meaning that the Dynamic Island probably won't be smaller. And they added that while the rear cameras will be redesigned, there won't be a two-tone color scheme. We've since seen how this single-color iPhone 17 Pro design might look.\nOne of these sources also claimed that the iPhone 17 will have a 6.1-inch screen, the iPhone 17 Air a 6.6-inch one, the iPhone 17 Pro will have a 6.3-inch display, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max will have a 6.9-inch one. So that\u2019s the same sizes as the iPhone 16 line, albeit the rumored new Air model could have a slightly smaller screen than the Plus model it might replace.\nThat said, a case maker has suggested the iPhone 17 could instead have a 6.3-inch screen like the Pro model.\nThere\u2019s also some disagreement on the iPhone 17 Air\u2019s screen size, with leaker Ross Young claiming it will be slightly smaller at 6.55 inches, while @UniverseIce says to expect a 6.65-inch screen, and another source points to a 6.7-inch 2796 x 1290 one.\nAlso on the subject of the iPhone 17 Air, one report suggests it won't be as slim as Apple hoped, with the company originally aiming for around a 6mm thickness but apparently failing to achieve that, as it needs more space for the battery.\nThat said, we've elsewhere heard that the iPhone 17 Air will be just 5.44mm thick, while another leak similarly says the iPhone 17 Air will in fact be 5mm to 6mm thick, but that thanks to this it won't have space for a SIM card slot (so it will be eSIM only). More recently, an iPhone 17 Air leaks has split the difference and pointed to a 5.5mm thickness.\nThis report adds that the iPhone 17 Air will also only have one earpiece speaker, rather than two as is the case on other iPhones, and that it will have a \u201clarge, centered camera bump\u201d housing just one lens.\nThis lack of a SIM card slot and only one speaker claim is something we've now heard multiple times.\nWe've also now seen an image showing how slim the iPhone 17 Air might be in comparison to the iPhone 17 Pro, and it certainly looks very thin there.\nAnother leak shows an iPhone 17 Air dummy unit (which is apparently 5.65mm thick) next to an iPhone 17 Pro Max dummy unit (which is 163.04 x 77.59 x 8.75mm) and an iPhone 17 one (which is 149.62 x 71.46 x 7.96mm). And again, the Air looks exceptionally slim.\nAnother leak similarly points to the iPhone 17 Pro Max being 8.76mm thick, and you can see this slim design again in photos showing an iPhone 17 Air dummy unit next to an iPhone 16 Plus. It even almost manages to make the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge look thick, though it's notable how far the Air's camera sticks out.\nWe've also heard that all four iPhone 17 models could have a 120Hz refresh rate and an always-on display. In fact, several sources have echoed this, saying that the base iPhone 17 will join its Pro siblings in having a 120Hz refresh rate and and always-on screen. We've heard this as recently as March 2025, with reputable leaker Mark Gurman saying as much.\nSo this wouldn\u2019t be an upgrade for the Pro models, but it would be for the standard iPhone 17, and for the iPhone 17 Air if we get such a phone. That said, in June 2025 we heard that while the base iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Air would have 120Hz refresh rates, these wouldn't be ProMotion screens, meaning they wouldn't have a variable refresh rate and probably wouldn't support always-on display.\nSpeaking of all the iPhone 17 models, a rumor has them all tipped to use Samsung's M14 OLED display, which features on the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max.\nHowever, the Pro models could still get a screen upgrade, with one source claiming that their displays will use a new technology that \"improves battery efficiency, maximizes display durability, and enhances overall performance compared to existing display technologies.\u201d\nFinally, we\u2019ve heard that the iPhone 17 line\u2019s screens might use a type of glass that\u2019s tougher to scratch and cuts down on reflections, but a more recent leak suggests this display upgrade has been scrapped. That said, more recently still we've heard the Pro models specifically could get a scratch-resistant, anti-reflective display, so there's still hope.\nCan you trust these rumors?\nApple bringing 120Hz screens to all four models is long overdue, so we certainly hope that's true, and it has been tipped enough that for now we'd say it's likely.\nThe talk of a new button is something we're less sure about, just because only one source has mentioned it so far, and they have a mixed track record.\nWe're also unsure about claims that all four models will have an aluminum frame, as that would seem like a downgrade for the Pro units. And the rumored changes to the camera design also seem questionable, but enough sources have mentioned this that it's certainly possible.\nMore megapixels\n- A new 48MP telephoto camera for the Pro models\n- New 24MP selfie cameras for all models\n- Possibly an 8x telephoto for the Pro models\nThe iPhone 17 line could include several significant camera upgrades, including a new 24MP front-facing camera for every iPhone 17 model, up from 12MP on the current phones. It\u2019s a claim this source (Jeff Pu) has made multiple times, most recently in March of 2025.\nThe same source also points to a 48MP telephoto camera for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, up from 12MP currently. We\u2019ve also heard analyst Ming-Chi Kuo say similar, though they weren\u2019t sure whether both Pro models would get this, or if only the iPhone 17 Pro Max would get a 48MP telephoto camera, with a more recent leak adding that the iPhone 17 Pro Max will apparently have the most powerful telephoto camera yet.\nAnd leaker @UniverseIce has also said that the Pro models will have a trio of 48MP cameras, meaning an upgrade for the telephoto but not \u2013 at least in terms of megapixels \u2013 for the main or ultra-wide cameras. Mark Gurman (who has a great track record for Apple information) has also made this 48MP telephoto camera claim.\nWe've heard mention of a trio of 48MP cameras from another source too, but they also claim that oddly the main camera on the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will have a smaller sensor than on the 16 Pro series, which sounds like a downgrade.\nAnd one source has claimed that as well as a new 48MP sensor, the the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will offer 3.5x optical zoom, rather than the 5x of the current models. However, they would reportedly still offer lossless zoom at 5x and 7x by cropping the image.\nMore recently, a leaker has claimed the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will instead have 8x optical zoom, and that all models could get a second Camera Control button to complement the existing one, with there also being talk of a new pro camera app. We're not super convinced by this though, especially as it only comes from one leak so far.\nWe've also heard that the iPhone 17 Pro models could offer 8K video recording.\nElsewhere, another leak says the standard iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air won't have a 5x telephoto camera. This isn't really surprising but it is disappointing. In fact, the iPhone 17 Air might just have one rear camera, with another source claiming the iPhone 17 Air will have a 48MP main camera and a 12MP front-facing one. Multiple sources have now pointed to the iPhone 17 Air having just a single 48MP camera on the back.\nIntriguingly, we\u2019ve heard that Apple might be planning a camera with a mechanical aperture for at least one phone in the iPhone 17 series. This would allow you to adjust the size of the aperture, and therefore the depth of field.\nAnd finally, Apple is reportedly testing a 200MP camera, though if this is ever used we'd expect it won't be until a later iPhone model.\nCan you trust these rumors?\nThe front-facing and telephoto cameras seem obvious upgrade choices in the iPhone 17 line, as their megapixel counts are noticeably lower than some of the other cameras. So there's a good chance those leaks will prove accurate.\nA boost in power\n- A powerful new A19 Pro chipset\n- Up to 12GB of RAM\nOne leak suggests that \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will have a new A19 Pro chipset, and that the other models will have either an A18 or A19 chipset. The same source also says to expect 12GB of RAM in the Pro models, up from 8GB currently, but that the standard iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Air will only have 8GB. They've now made this claim multiple times, so they seem confident of it.\nAnother source has echoed this, saying to expect an A19 Pro chipset and 12GB of RAM in the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max. This chipset will reportedly be built on a new 3-nanometer manufacturing process, which could mean a big jump in performance.\nElsewhere we've heard that the iPhone 17 Air could have 12GB of RAM too, along with an A19 \u2013 but not A19 Pro \u2013 chipset. This is a claim we've now heard more than once. Interestingly, another source not only echoes that RAM amount but says that the iPhone 17 Air will actually have an A19 Pro chipset, albeit one with one less GPU core than the Pro models. We've now heard this claim multiple times too.\nThat said, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claims that only the iPhone 17 Pro Max will get 12GB of RAM, with the others stuck at 8GB, and that the Pro Max will also have an upgraded cooling system, and exclusively have \u201cenhanced on-device AI capabilities.\u201d\nKuo also claims that the iPhone 17 line could use a lighter and thinner motherboard, which would leave room for other components or a larger battery. And speaking of the battery, the iPhone 17 Air might have a high-density cell, giving it comparable life to current iPhones, though the iPhone 17 Air's actual capacity might be under 3,000mAh.\nWe've also heard that the iPhone 17 Air might support MagSafe, and that it might support a battery case accessory, which could make up for any stamina shortfalls.\nAlso on the battery front, the iPhone 17 Pro Max is rumored to have a 5,000mAh battery, which would be much bigger than the iPhone 16 Pro Max's.\nThere\u2019s also an outside chance that some or all iPhone 17 models could include under-display Touch ID, giving you a fingerprint sensor as well as Face ID, but we doubt that.\nWe've also heard that Apple might equip the iPhone 17 series with a vapor chamber to help keep these phones cool, though there's disagreement on whether all four models or just the iPhone 17 Pro series would get a vapor chamber.\nFinally on the hardware front, the iPhone 17 Air might use Apple's in-house 5G modem, but this reportedly doesn't perform as well as the Qualcomm modems the company currently uses \u2013 and we've heard that the base model iPhone 17 could even miss out on Apple's C1 modem.\nAs for software, we expect these phones to run iOS 26 out of the box, and while this software isn't finished yet, it has been announced. So we know it includes a new 'Liquid Glass' appearance, and overhauls to many apps, such as the Phone and Camera apps. It also features improvements to Apple Intelligence, a new Apple Games app, and more.\nCan you trust these rumors?\nNew chipsets are sure to make an appearance, and we'd expect at least some models would get boosted to 12GB of RAM, especially as this could help with AI.\nWe'd be quite surprised though if Touch ID makes a return, even in under-display form.\nYou might also like\n- iPhone 16 Pro review: pocket-sized brilliance and no concessions\n- iPhone 16 Pro Max review: a beautiful, intelligent beast\n- Best iPhone: which Apple smartphone reigns supreme?\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "Finally, something fresh: Apple could be bringing some punchy color to the iPhone 17 Pro\n- Claimed iPhone 17 dummy units tip a punchy orange color for the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max\n- The iPhone 17 Air is tipped to have a nice sand-colored option, alongside blue, back, and white options\n- The standard iPhone 17 is expected to sport black, white, light blue, and pastel pink color options\nDummy units of the rumored iPhone 17 range have given us a good idea of what colors to expect from Apple's next-generation phones, and if they come to fruition, could see the iPhone Pro lineup get a dose of punchy color.\nThis comes from Apple-centric tipster Sony Dickson, who posted a selection of iPhone 17 dummy units in a mix of colors, which we're led to believe come from insider information.\nWhile the iPhone 17 features a fetching pink pastel-like hue, and the rumored iPhone 17 Air comes in a pleasant sand-ish color, the standout is an iPhone 17 Pro dummy unit in a bright orange hue.\nFirst look at iPhone 17 color dummies, The new orange really stands out this year \u2014 definitely a bold addition. Thoughts? pic.twitter.com/M0gB6NSglIJuly 29, 2025\nIf this information turns out to be accurate it could mark a mild direction change for Apple, in that previously the Pro iPhones have tended to use somewhat muted colors: the Desert Titanium model of the iPhone 16 Pro Max was probably about as bold as the flagship phones go, with the rest of the iPhone 16 Pro lineup leaning on more basic shades such as white, black, and grey.\nSo the addition of orange could give the iPhone Pro a shot in the arm when it comes to punchy colors. From the dummy units, the orange has a candy-like hue with a form of pastel flatness to it; the latter would be in keeping with the style of recent Pro iPhones.\nComplementary colors\nWith the caveat that these images are far from official and there's no clear indication of where these dummy units have come from, I feel the colors on offer across the proposed iPhone 17 range work nicely.\nThey have the usual black and white options to appease people who like muted phones, with a dark blue shade potentially making a comeback for the iPhone 17 Pro models.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe light blue and pink options for the iPhone 17 offer a pop of freshness without being too oversaturated. While the light blue and light yellow/sand colors for the iPhone 17 Air look like they could work nicely on a slimmed-down iPhone.\nFor the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max, I reckon the tipped colors work well for the new rectangular rear camera array; sort of emphasising it, yet also helping it blend into the rear of the phone at the same time... if that makes a jot of sense.\nOf course, I'm still not entirely convinced this much-rumored camera design change will happen, as I can't see how it would benefit the iPhone 17 Pro's camera performance; Apple tends not to just change its phone designs for pure aesthetics alone.\nUnless adopting this rectangular camera array is a means to better package components, and thus leading to a slimmer iPhone Pro. But this is just educated speculation on my side.\nWith Apple very likely to launch new iPhones in September, when it usually holds a phone-centric Apple event, we really don't have much longer to wait before we hear about new iPhones.\nYou might also like\n- Is this the iPhone 17 Pro?

      "text": "The iPhone 17 Air almost makes the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge look thick in new dummy unit photos\n- New photos show an iPhone 17 Air dummy unit alongside the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge\n- Apple's phone looks quite a lot slimmer than Samsung's\n- However, its camera appears to stick out further\nIt looks like we\u2019re going to see a battle of the super slim smartphones this year, as not long ago, the 5.8mm thick Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge launched, and we\u2019re expecting the iPhone 17 Air to follow very soon \u2013 a phone that could be even slimmer.\nTipsters haven\u2019t yet settled on exactly how thick Apple\u2019s upcoming phone will be, with various sources putting it at between 5.0mm and 6.0mm. But the bulk of recent leaks position it somewhere in the middle of those figures, with 5.44mm, 5.5mm, and 5.65mm having been put forward by separate sources.\nIf the iPhone 17 Air does come in at any one of those rumored thicknesses, it will be slimmer than the Galaxy S25 Edge, and while a difference of roughly 0.15mm \u2013 0.35mm might not sound like much, a leaked photo suggests the difference in thickness between these two phones could be really noticeable.\nBe honest, S25 Edge or iPhone 17 Air? \ud83d\udc40 pic.twitter.com/F81O7Q1WeIAugust 17, 2025\nShared by @theonecid, the photos above show a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge alongside what\u2019s presumably an iPhone 17 Air dummy unit, and you can see that the latter looks much slimmer.\nHaving said that, it also looks like the iPhone 17 Air\u2019s camera lens might stick a bit further out than Samsung\u2019s, so at the widest point, it might not be much slimmer. Still, for the most par,t the iPhone 17 Air looks impressively thin here.\nComing with compromises\nOf course, there are inevitably compromises in having such a slim phone, with the biggest rumored one being just one camera lens on the back. The Galaxy S25 Edge has two, and the standard iPhone 17 is expected to have two as well.\nBeyond that, it\u2019s also likely that the iPhone 17 Air will have a small battery, so you might have to sacrifice quite a lot if you choose Apple\u2019s slimmest phone.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nBut options are good. If you want something slightly thicker, there\u2019s the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge, and if you don\u2019t care about slim phones at all, then there are all sorts of other devices to choose from \u2013 including the rest of the iPhone 17 line, all of which we\u2019re expecting to launch in early September.\nYou might also like\n- The iPhone 17 Pro could cost $50 more than its predecessor \u2013 here\u2019s what that might mean for other configurations\n- iPhone 17 Air leak reveals what it might lack compared to the iPhone 17 Pro \u2013 and I think that's too big a compromise\n- 'This looks hideous': the iPhone 17 Pro has been shown off in a new orange shade that you\u2019re going to either love or hate\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "Apple could be killing off an entire line of iPhone accessories after just one year\nStock of Apple\u2019s faux-leather FineWoven iPhone cases and Apple Watch bands is at an \u201call-time low\u201d, suggesting that the controversial product line might be discontinued just a year after launching.\nThat\u2019s according to Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman, who says low stock of FineWoven iPhone cases and Apple Watch bands means that Apple is either planning to discontinue the accessories or refresh the lineup with new colors and support for new devices.\nThe next major Apple event, titled \u2018It\u2019s Glowtime\u2019, is scheduled to take place on September 9, and we expect to hear news of the iPhone 16 family, the Apple Watch Ultra 3, and Apple Intelligence at the Cupertino-set showcase. If Apple is keeping FineWoven around, the company is likely preparing for a case refresh alongside these new hardware products.\nApple launched its line of FineWoven iPhone cases, Apple Watch bands, and AirTag holders alongside the iPhone 15 series in September 2023.\nFineWoven was introduced to replace leather in Apple\u2019s accessories as part of the company\u2019s mission to make every product carbon-neutral by 2030. The material is made up of 68% \u201cpost-consumer recycled content\u201d according to Apple, but the company has not released details on what, exactly, the stuff is made of.\nHowever, customer reaction to FineWoven has been generally poor since Apple began using the fabric for accessories just one year ago.\nIn our review of the FineWoven iPhone 15 Pro case, we called the product \u201ca disaster\u201d, while The Verge called FineWoven \u201ccategorically terrible\u201d and CNET said it \u201ccan\u2019t applaud\u201d the cases while respecting Apple\u2019s move away from leather.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nApple closing the upcycled curtains on FineWoven would be an unprecedented move, given that the company typically maintains features and product lines for several years, even in the face of bad reviews.\nThe unreliable Butterfly Keyboard introduced to MacBooks in 2015 remains one of the most notorious examples, with Apple even launching a repair scheme before finally ditching the keyboard with the 2019 16-inch MacBook Pro.\nRegarding FineWoven, we\u2019ve only heard rumors at this point, and it\u2019ll be up to Apple to decide whether FineWoven will be a rare exception to the rule.\nGurman adds that stock shortages are also being noted for the third-generation iPhone SE, the iPad mini, AirPods, and multiple Apple Watch models, suggesting updates for these products could be on the way, too.\nYou might also like\nJamie is a Mobile Computing Staff Writer for TechRadar, responsible for covering phones and tablets.

      "text": "The iPhone 17 Air might come in these 4 colors \u2013 and there's an interesting claim about its chipset too\n- The iPhone 17 Air could be sold in black, silver, light gold, and light blue shades\n- It may also have an A19 Pro chipset, rather than the base A19\n- However, previous leaks disagree with that chipset claim\nIf you\u2019ve got your sights set on the iPhone 17 Air, you can also now start thinking about what color you'd like your slimline iPhone to be, as a new leak has revealed the four shades that Apple will apparently sell the device in.\nAccording to leaker Majin Bu \u2013 citing a previous leak from Fixed Focus Digital which they claim to have now \u201cconfirmed\u201d \u2013 the iPhone 17 Air will be available in black, silver, light gold, and light blue shades.\nThe black shade is apparently a \u201cdark and understated tone\u201d, the silver model is said to be \u201cbright and clear\u201d, the light gold is described as being \u201cwarm and soft\u201d, and the light blue as \u201cvery light\u201d and \u201cevoking a clear sky\u201d.\nYou can see how these colors might look in the image Majin Bu provided above, though it sounds like the shades shown are probably guesses based on how their sources described the colors.\nIn any case, we\u2019d take this information with a pinch of salt \u2013 although the use of mostly quite pale, delicate shades seems fitting for phone that\u2019s likely to be billed as slim and elegant.\nSome surprising chipset news\nIn other iPhone 17 Air news, leaker Fixed Focus Digital (via Phone Arena) has claimed that the handset will have an A19 Pro chipset. That\u2019s at odds with previous leaks, which suggested only the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max would have this chipset, while the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air would have an A19.\nHowever, they added that the iPhone 17 Air will get a version of the A19 Pro with a five-core GPU while the iPhone 17 Pro models will get a six-core version, in which case the Pro models would still have the most powerful chipset.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThey also mention RAM, saying that the standard iPhone 17 will have 8GB, while the other three models will have 12GB. So if this is all correct then the upcoming iPhones could have three different power tiers rather than the usual two.\nWe\u2019re a bit skeptical of this since it would be a change of form for Apple, and since other leaks point to the iPhone 17 Air having the base A19 chipset, but if Apple does boost the power that could help to make up for the Air only having one rear camera lens, which is something that\u2019s widely rumored to be the case.\nWe should find out exactly how powerful the iPhone 17 Air is \u2013 and what colors it\u2019s available in \u2013 sometime in September, as that\u2019s when it will likely launch, alongside the rest of the iPhone 17 series.\nYou might also like\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "There\u2019s more proof Apple will kill off its FineWoven cases at today's iPhone 16 event\nApple is known for the quality of its products, which is why it\u2019s all the more surprising when the company occasionally releases a dud. But Apple\u2019s FineWoven cases, introduced with the iPhone 15 range, are more than just a dud \u2013 they\u2019ve been a disaster, and now it seems almost certain that they\u2019re destined for the scrap heap.\nThat\u2019s because a prominent leaker has claimed that Apple is set to replace its FineWoven cases with a new alternative. That\u2019s according to Majin Bu on X (formerly Twitter), who shared two images of what they claimed will be the new cases and the complete range of colors they will apparently arrive in.\nMany of the colors are the same as the existing FineWoven cases, including blue, green, black, and taupe. Apple\u2019s mulberry color has apparently been replaced with a dark purple, and there\u2019s supposedly a new gray version in the works too. Majin Bu didn\u2019t explain what material the new cases would be made from, other than to say that it would be something new to replace FineWoven.\nMajin Bu has a mixed track record when it comes to Apple leaks, correctly predicting some upcoming features while getting others wrong. Interestingly to this point, the account seemed to retract the second image they posted when someone pointed out that it depicted existing leather cases, suggesting their due diligence was not at the level it should have been.\nWhat\u2019s the problem with FineWoven?\nIt would be an understatement to say that Apple\u2019s FineWoven cases have met with disappointment. The products are made with a micro twill material, and were meant to be an eco-friendlier alternative to Apple\u2019s leather cases. Yet they met with an almost immediate backlash.\nUsers complained that the cases scratched easily, and that these scratches could not be removed or masked. For others, the fabric material was a magnet for stains and blemishes, leading one reporter to joke that their FineWoven case was so dirty that it posed a \u201cbiomedical concern.\u201d\nIt seems that this criticism did not escape Apple\u2019s ears, and reports have suggested that the company has halted production of FineWoven cases and could announce that it's discontinuing them during its iPhone 16 event later today. That gives a boost to Majin Bu\u2019s claim that something new is coming to replace FineWoven.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nUltimately, we\u2019ll find out later today when Apple kicks off its iPhone 16 event and reveals a bunch of new phones, with fresh cases potentially in hot pursuit.

      "text": "The iPhone 17 has a rumored launch date \u2013 here are 5 big changes to expect\n- The iPhone 17 series could be unveiled on September 9\n- It might then ship on September 19\n- We've detailed five of the biggest changes you can expect from these phones\nWe\u2019ve long predicted \u2013 based on Apple\u2019s usual patterns \u2013 that the iPhone 17 series would be announced on September 8, 9, or 10, and now a leak agrees with us, while also getting more specific.\nAccording to \u201cinternal information from German mobile phone providers\u201d shared by iphone-ticker.de (via GSMArena), the iPhone 17 series \u2013 including the iPhone 17 itself, the iPhone 17 Air, the iPhone 17 Pro, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max \u2013 will be unveiled on Tuesday, September 9.\nThey add that these phones will then apparently ship a week and a half later, on Friday, September 19.\nWhile we\u2019d take these claims with a pinch of salt, it is believable that major retailers would now have this information. Plus, it fits with our own predictions, and doesn\u2019t conflict with any other leaks, so for now we\u2019d say September 9 looks to be the most likely announcement date.\nIn which case, there\u2019s only just over a month to wait for Apple\u2019s next handsets, and these phones are likely to be worth the wait, as numerous upgrades and changes have been tipped. Below, we\u2019ve listed five of the biggest changes we\u2019re expecting.\n1. A new design\nPerhaps the biggest change tipped for the iPhone 17 line is a visual one, with numerous sources suggesting these handsets will get a redesign.\nThe main change is likely to come to the camera block, which will reportedly run across the entire width of the back on most models, giving these phones a more Google Pixel 9-like appearance.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThis change could allow for more of a two-tone color scheme, too, with the large camera block being glossy while the rest of the rear is more matte.\n2. An iPhone 17 Air instead of an iPhone 17 Plus\nAnother big rumored change is the replacement of the Plus model with an iPhone 17 Air. This new model will reportedly be far slimmer than any previous iPhone, likely coming in at around 5.5mm thick, which would make it a more direct rival to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge.\nHowever, as a result of being so slim, it might also have a small battery, and is thought to have just one rear camera.\nSo, it\u2019s a phone that might prioritize style over specs, though it could still have a large 6.7-inch screen like the iPhone 16 Plus.\n3. A 120Hz refresh rate for every model\nApple has continued to stick with 60Hz screens on the base iPhones, despite most mid-range Android phones having had 120Hz screens for years now. But with the iPhone 17 line, Apple might finally be getting with the times.\nNumerous reports suggest that all four expected models will have a 120Hz display, which should make scrolling feel smoother.\nHowever, one source claims that while the screens will all be 120Hz, the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air still won\u2019t have a variable refresh rate, meaning that, unlike their Pro siblings, they probably wouldn\u2019t support always-on display, as this needs a very low refresh rate to function without demolishing the battery. Either way, though, giving them a 120Hz refresh rate would definitely be an upgrade.\n4. New cameras\nThe iPhone 17 series is also rumored to be getting some new cameras, with every model set to benefit.\nFor one thing, all four expected iPhone 17 models will apparently have a 24MP front-facing camera, giving you twice the megapixels of the current 12MP one. We\u2019ve also heard that the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max could have a 48MP telephoto camera, which would be up from just 12MP on the current models.\nSome less likely but still possible upgrades we\u2019ve heard about include 8K video recording for the Pro models, and a mechanical aperture for at least one iPhone 17 model. That latter upgrade would allow you to adjust the aperture, and therefore also the depth of field.\nAnd there are also some rumored camera upgrades that we\u2019re not convinced we\u2019ll see but can\u2019t totally rule out, including an 8x optical zoom for the iPhone 17 Pro models and a second Camera Control button for all four models.\n5. A big boost in power\nFinally, one totally unsurprising but still appreciated upgrade that we\u2019re hearing about is a power boost thanks to a new chipset.\nSpecifically, the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max could have a new A19 Pro chipset, while the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air could have an A19 chipset. In all cases, that should be an improvement, as the current models use A18 or A18 Pro chipsets.\nAdditionally, the iPhone 17 Pro, the iPhone 17 Pro Max, and possibly also the iPhone 17 Air could have 12GB of RAM \u2013 up from 8GB in the iPhone 16 series.\nYou might also like\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "The iPhone 17 Pro looks gorgeous in new renders, and it could get a protective display boost too\n- New renders show the alleged colors coming to the iPhone 17 Pro range\n- Information on the iPhone 17 colors has also leaked out\n- The iPhone 17 Pro might also get an even stronger display\nWe don\u2019t normally get a peek at Apple\u2019s upcoming iPhones until the company unveils them at its September launch event. But that\u2019s all changed with the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max, as AppleInsider has produced a set of renders that it says are based on \u201cprevalent rumors and speculation.\u201d\nMuch of that speculation is based on a report from Macworld earlier this week, which claimed to have obtained an \u201cinternal document\u201d used by Apple to detail the forthcoming colors, complete with Pantone color names.\nNow, AppleInsider has put that information to use in its renders. The images show the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max in five colors: Orange, Dark Blue, Gray, Black and Silver.\nThat\u2019s quite a departure from the colors found in the iPhone 16 Pro range. Although the Black and Gray tones will supposedly correspond with the Black Titanium and Natural Titanium of the iPhone 16 Pro, the Orange, Dark Blue and Silver shades do not match with any color currently in use in a Pro-tier iPhone.\nAppleInsider didn\u2019t provide renders for the non-Pro devices in the iPhone 17 range, which is set to include the iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Air. However, Macworld\u2019s recent leak gives us a few hints of what we might see there too.\nAccording to Macworld\u2019s report, the iPhone 17 will apparently be available in six different options: Black, White, Steel Gray, Green, Purple and Light Blue. The Black and White tones will be the same as the ones you find in the iPhone 16, with the other four being new.\nAs for the iPhone 17 Air, it will supposedly come in Black, White, Light Blue and Light Gold \u2013 colors claimed by leaker Majin Bu earlier in July. While its Black shade will be the same as that found in the iPhone 16, the White option will be a touch brighter compared to that device.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAn even stronger display\nThe new colors are not the only enticing iPhone 17 Pro leak that has just appeared. According to a source speaking to MacRumors, the iPhone 17 Pro could get a scratch-resistant, anti-reflective display that provides more protection than Apple\u2019s current Ceramic Shield protective glass.\nWhat\u2019s unusual is that this tech was originally rumored in March 2024, but it was later suggested that production issues meant Apple might put it on hold. Now, it seems to be on the way again \u2013 although only in the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max, not the iPhone 17 or iPhone 17 Air.\nGiven the back-and-forth history of this feature, we\u2019ll take this latest rumor with a dose of skepticism. But if Apple is able to strengthen the iPhone 17 Pro\u2019s display \u2013 and offer the device in a range of intriguing new colors \u2013 it could be a tempting device when it launches later this year.\nYou might also like\nAlex Blake has been fooling around with computers since the early 1990s, and since that time he's learned a thing or two about tech.

      "text": "The end of FineWoven? Apple reportedly stops production of the eco-friendly accessories\nIt\u2019s safe to say that Apple\u2019s FineWoven accessories have been a disaster from the moment they launched, with people criticizing them for their perceived lack of durability and the ease with which they can get damaged. Now, it seems that Apple has decided to cut its losses, and could phase out the entire range.\nThat\u2019s if a leaker who goes by the name Kosutami is to be believed, at least. Writing on X (formerly Twitter), Kosutami claimed that \u201cFineWoven has gone,\u201d adding that \u201cAll the production line was stopped and removed\u201d [sic]. That presumably covers all FineWoven accessories, including iPhone cases and Apple Watch straps.\nAccording to Kosutami, Apple made the move specifically due to the material\u2019s poor durability. It will switch to a different substance, Kosutami says, but we won't see a return to the leather products that Apple discontinued at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June 2023.\nWhat that material will be remains a mystery, but there\u2019s a chance we\u2019ll see it at this year\u2019s WWDC event on June 10. Kosutami\u2019s prediction that Apple won\u2019t return to leather makes a lot of sense, though, since Apple made a point of highlighting leather\u2019s heavy environmental impact last year. Bringing out new leather accessories, then, would not be a good look.\nFarewell FineWoven\nFor a company with a reputation for delivering hit products forged with impeccable build quality, the FineWoven case has been a rare and notable miss. It\u2019s received almost universal criticism since it launched in September 2023.\nFor instance, journalist Joanna Stern declared that her FineWoven iPhone case was \u201cbrowning like a rotten banana\u201d and likened it to a \u201cbiomedical concern,\u201d while TechRadar\u2019s own Axel Metz felt that his case was easily scratched and felt \u201cclammy\u201d in the hand. It \u201cisn\u2019t a total disaster,\u201d Metz added, \u201cJust a very big one.\u201d Small comfort for Apple, then.\nKosutami has previously shared accurate information regarding upcoming Apple products and decisions (including several previous leaks concerning FineWoven accessories), so this latest report shouldn\u2019t be immediately dismissed. Given the reception that Apple\u2019s FineWoven products have received over their short lifetimes, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Kosutami\u2019s claims prove to be correct.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nTechRadar has approached Apple for comment, and we'll update this article if we get a response.\nYou might also like\nAlex Blake has been fooling around with computers since the early 1990s, and since that time he's learned a thing or two about tech.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nFor the first time in a while, Apple's most affordable new iPhone doesn't feel miles away from the flagship. Apple finally waves goodbye to the notch in favor of the Dynamic Island on all phones in its new lineup, and on the iPhone 15 that versatile screen technology is paired with new materials, lovely contoured edges, a powerful A16 Bionic CPU, and, yes, the new USB-C port. Even the photography has been leveled up, with a 48MP camera and new portrait processing capabilities. If you want a fresh iPhone model, this is your most affordable and best option \u2013 and you won't feel like you're missing out on much.\nPros\n- +\nDynamic Island arrives to retire the notch\n- +\nSmoother design and soft-feel, color-infused rear glass\n- +\nA16 Bionic chip\n- +\n48MP image sensor\nCons\n- -\nNo zoom lens\n- -\nNo macro capabilities\n- -\nCan run a little hot\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nEditor's Note\n\u2022 Original review date: September 2023\n\u2022 Launch price: $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,499\n\u2022 Target price now: $699 / \u00a3699 / AU$1,285\nUpdate \u2013 March 2024: The base iPhone 15 may not have the insane performance of the Pro model's A17 Pro chipset or triple rear camera, but it remains an incredibly powerful smartphone in its own right that can take on newer rivals from Google, Samsung and even the latest Xiaomi 14 in some areas.\nIf you're looking for money off, in the US buying refurbished is the best way to go for those after an unlocked handset, with the likes of Walmart serving up 'restored' 128GB iPhone 15s in 'excellent condition' for as low as $679 (at the time of this update, at least). Discounts are easier to come by in the UK, with Amazon knocking \u00a3100 off as one example, while retailers in Australia are starting to drop prices by as much as 15%.\nSince its debut, iOS 17 has gained a few new abilities \u2013 including EU-specific sideloading \u2013 but beyond that slight upgrade the rest of this review remains as previously published.\niPhone 15: Two-minute review\nWelcome to the more modern 'standard' iPhone 15, or at least a standard iPhone that now seems more in step with its higher-end siblings.\nThe iPhone 15 has last year's best chipset (the A16 Bionic) and last year's best 48MP image sensor, but Apple has also finally dropped the beleaguered notch in favor of the same Dynamic Island as all the other iPhone 15 models, and last year's iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max.\nThat new, more modern screen also matches that of the best iPhone, the new iPhone 15 Pro Max (and Pro) with sunshine-beating 2,000-nit brightness. Even the design essentially matches the best of the iPhone 15 lineup, with newly contoured edges for a more ergonomic feel, and the now-obligatory (thanks to European regulators) USB-C port (though not one that supports USB 3.0 10Gbps speeds).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe iPhone 15 even has something that it can consider all its own: color-infused back glass that's now brushed rather than shiny. It looks great and feels even better, making this iPhone 15 just a little less slippery than its predecessor.\nThe main camera gets a nice bump over last year's, and the iPhone 15 only suffers in direct comparison to the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max (you can find out more about this year's top of the line iPhone in my full iPhone 15 Pro Max review), which also have a 48MP sensor, but one that's larger and thus produces even better images.\nStill, the iPhone 15's new 48MP main camera, with the sensor inherited from the iPhone 14 Pro handsets, is nothing to sniff at, and it now shoots at a default 24MP, with the processing stitching together the best of a pixel-binned 12MP image and all the data from the 48MP image.\nThere is zoom, of a sort, on the iPhone 15. You get 2x zoom, but this is accomplished by cropping into the center 12MP of the 48MP sensor. That's optical, but it doesn't quite compare to the dedicated 3x optical zoom on the iPhone 15 Pro or the Pro Max's 5x optical, let alone the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra's 10x optical zoom.\nThe iPhone 15 remains one of Apple's most pocketable phones (especially with Apple having discontinued the iPhone mini) and it now demands fewer compromises. You get the brightest, notch-free screen, a very able last-generation mobile CPU, and a lot of megapixels to play with for all your smartphone photography needs.\nIf you'd prefer what is essentially the same phone but with a larger body and screen, check out our iPhone 15 Plus review; and if you want to go Pro but can't quite stretch to the Max, read our iPhone 15 Pro review. But if you want to join the iPhone family, and not pay a lot of money for the privilege, the iPhone 15 is the best palm-sized choice.\niPhone 15 review: Price and availability\n- Priced from $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,499\nApple unveiled the iPhone 15 alongside the iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max at its 'Wonderlust' event on September 12. The phone became available to buy in-store and online on September 22.\nAlthough there was talk of a range-wide price rise this year, the iPhone 15 price (along with the Plus and Pro) is the same as that of the iPhone 14 in the US, with the standard 128GB model starting at $799.\nIn the UK, the iPhone 14 saw a notable increase in price compared to its predecessor, and the welcome news is that the iPhone 15 gets a similarly notable price cut, starting at \u00a3799 where the iPhone 14 started at \u00a3849. Australian pricing is marginally higher year-on-year. Full iPhone 15 pricing is as follows:\n| 128GB | $799 | \u00a3799 | AU$1,499 |\n| 256GB | $899 | \u00a3899 | AU$1,699 |\n| 512GB | $1,099 | \u00a31,099 | AU$2,049 |\nIf you're already sold on the promise of the iPhone 15, head over to our iPhone 15 deals page for a roundup of all the best offers available now.\n- Value score: 4.5 / 5\niPhone 15 review: Specs\nHere's how the iPhone 15 compares specs-wise to the rest of the iPhone 15 lineup:\n| iPhone 15 | iPhone 15 Plus | iPhone 15 Pro | iPhone 15 Pro Max | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Dimensions: | 147.6 x 71.6 x 7.80mm | 160.9 x 77.8 x 7.80mm | 146.6 x 70.6 x 8.25mm | 159.9 x 76.7 x 8.25mm |\n| Weight: | 171g | 201g | 187g | 221g |\n| Display: | 6.1-inch OLED | 6.7-inch OLED | 6.1-inch OLED | 6.7-inch OLED |\n| Resolution: | 2556 x 1179 pixels | 2796 x 1290 pixels | 2556 x 1179 pixels | 2796 x 1290 pixels |\n| Refresh rate: | 60Hz | 60Hz | Adaptive 1-120Hz | Adaptive 1-120Hz |\n| Chipset: | A16 Bionic | A16 Bionic | A17 Pro | A17 Pro |\n| Rear cameras: | 48MP main, 12MP ultrawide | 48MP main, 12MP ultrawide | 48MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide, 12MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom | 48MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide, 12MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom |\n| Front camera: | 12MP | 12MP | 12MP | 12MP |\n| Storage: | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 256GB, 512GB, 1TB |\niPhone 15 review: Design\n- Smooth edges for a softer look and feel\n- Color-infused back glass\n- USB-C\n- Right-sized for pockets and palms\nLike the rest of the models in the new range, the iPhone 15 is instantly recognizable as an iPhone. Its dimensions, 146.7 x 71.6 x 7.8mm, virtually match those of the iPhone 14 (and are quite close to those of Samsung's comparable Galaxy S23, which is slightly lighter).\nImportantly, though, the iPhone 15 does what the iPhone 14 did not: it moves the base model forward with a refreshed chassis design, a brand-new way of making the phone's glass back, and, of course, the Dynamic Island, which replaces the notch with something more attractive and versatile.\nBetween that, the contoured edges, and the new USB-C port, there is, design-wise, a lot more alignment between the iPhone 15 and the rest of the new lineup.\nThe new color-infused glass back is a nice upgrade. I really like the way it looks, and how it perfectly compliments the newly contoured smartphone edges; it has an overall warmer look and feel.\nI'm not sure I'm sold on the pastel hues available across all the iPhone 15 phones, though. The yellow of my review unit looks far more muted than the yellow in which the iPhone 14 is available. Your other color options are Blue, Pink, Green, and Black, none of which goes any stronger than relatively muted pastel hues. If you like your colors bold, your best option is Pink \u2013 I handled that model backstage at the launch event and I really liked it.\nThe iPhone's front screen is still protected by the ceramic shield, and the body is made of 75% recycled aluminum. There are other partially recycled materials inside the iPhone 15, too, including cobalt in the battery, and copper through a number of the components.\nAside from the contoured edges, Apple has left the body mostly untouched since the iPhone 14. The power / sleep / Siri button is still in the same spot on the right side, and the dual volume buttons are in their usual spots on the left. While the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max get the nifty new Action button, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus still have the classic ring / silence switch, and while there's nothing wrong with this analog switch, if you see a friend with the iPhone 15 Pro you may start pining for your own more versatile button.\nThe bottom of the iPhone 15 looks like the bottom the iPhone 14 at first glance, but there's one very significant change here: the slightly larger, new, USB-C port. It's the same as the ones on all the iPhone 15 models, though the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus will not support high-speed USB 3 connections.\nAs you already surmised, your old Lighting cables won't work with this port, but Apple does include a USB-C-to-USB-C cable in the box.\nOverall, I consider the iPhone 15 to be a design upgrade. It's not an overhaul, but it is a refresh that makes the phone look and feel better than its predecessor.\n- Design score: 4 / 5\niPhone 15 review: Display\n- Upgraded Super Retina XDR\n- No change to the resolution, refresh rate or screen size\n- Goodbye notch\n- Still no ProMotion\nApple didn't change the resolution of the screen on the iPhone 15, but by shaving a few millimeters off the black bezel surrounding the screen, it gained a few extra pixels. Its 2556 x 1179 resolution is still 460ppi but the display is larger than the iPhone 14's 2532 x 1170 screen.\nIt's not just the extra pixels that raise the display a \u2013 ahem \u2013 notch above the iPhone 14. There's the Dynamic Island, which conveys information about things like your next Uber, directions, and what music you're playing. A tap on it gives you even more information. This is all the same functionality that iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max users have to come to enjoy and now it's part of the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus.\nThe other big upgrade is in brightness. The iPhone 15's screen now has a max 2,000 nits brightness and in my tests, it is noticeably brighter than the iPhone 14. Like the rest of Apple's Super Retina XDR OLEDs, the iPhone 15's 6.1-inch screen supports a wide color gamut and 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio for inky blacks. In my experience, everything looks great on the display.\nIt does not support ProMotion, which means the refresh rate is stuck at 60Hz and there's no support for Always On. iOS 17's new StandBy mode still works when you dock your phone sideways on a MagSafe wireless charger, but the screen will either be on or off.\nIt's really not fair to hold this against the iPhone 15. It's a $799 phone and if you want flagship features, Apple expects you to pay flagship prices. ProMotion, with the ability to stop down to 1Hz, is Pro-level stuff, at least if you live in Apple's world. The Samsung Galaxy S23 offers variable refresh rates from 48Hz to 120Hz.\nOverall, though, this is an excellent smartphone display with enough capability and features to satisfy most users.\n- Display score: 4 / 5\niPhone 15 review: Cameras\n- New 48MP camera\n- Excellent portrait features\n- 2x \"zoom\"\nThere are still just two lenses on the back of the iPhone 15, but they are not the same pair as you found on the iPhone 14. Okay, the 12MP ultrawide is basically the same, but the main camera is now the same 48MP lens that you'll find on the iPhone 14 Pro. That's not the same sensor as the larger one that now resides inside the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, mind.\nEven so, this is a significant upgrade from the iPhone 14's 12MP main camera, and all of the cameras are backed by the last-gen A16 Bionic and an upgraded image pipeline technology (photonic engine and computational photography) that affords a few cool, new photography features.\nApple has also added millimeter distinctions to all the camera magnifications that approximate what you might find if you were using physical lenses. So, you can now see that the ultrawide camera is like a 13mm lens (on lenses, mm defines the field of view and magnification) and 2x is 52mm.\nFirst, though, all the cameras on the iPhone 15:\n- Main: 48MP f/1.6\n- Ultrawide: 12MP f/2.4\n- Front-facing TrueDepth: 12MP f/1.9\nThis does not count the 2x optical zoom that is actually part of the 48MP lens. The iPhone 15 takes the middle 12 pixels of the full frame to deliver an optically zoomed-in image. This is more useful than it sounds. It's a great way of getting closer to the action without moving closer and, unlike digitally zoomed photos, the quality of these 12MP images is, essentially, optical quality. It's really just a smart live crop, but I still like it.\nIf you want more zoom from a $799 smartphone, you might want to look at the Samsung Galaxy S23, which includes a 10MP, 3x optical zoom camera.\nAll photos from the main camera also look better because they're all 24MP by default. Apple's new photo processing takes binned 12MPs (four pixels at a time from the 48MP sensor) and then combines that with a full-frame 48MP image.\nThe result is pictures that look better than what I could get with the iPhone 14. When I compared some of the images with what I took using a Samsung Galaxy S23, the iPhone 15 consistently delivered more truthful recreations of the world I see around me. I like Samsung photography, but it still tends to over-ripen colors. Flowers are too bright and the sky is too blue.\nPortrait photography across the iPhone 15 line has undergone a useful transformation. Basically, any photo you take with the main camera can be a portrait image as long as the iPhone identifies a person or a pet and collects depth information. More often than not, in my experience, it does.\nWhat this means is you can take a photo and then change it into portrait mode after the fact. You'll know if a photo can be edited into portrait mode by the little \"Portrait f\" symbol on it. You can tap on this symbol to transform the photo into Portrait Mode. If you edit the photo, you can make more adjustments, including adjusting the depth of field. Better yet, you can choose where you want to focus. All it takes is a tap on a subject or object. What this means is that you almost never have to be upset when you don't choose \"Portrait Mode\" for a photo. It's a great update that I enjoyed using.\nVideo quality is still excellent and you can shoot up to 4K 60 fps. I enjoy shooting in Cinematic mode, which lets you add a short focus effect to all your videos and choose which subject or object you want to focus on while you shoot. If you didn't like your initial choice, you can always edit and select a different focus subject.\nLow-light photography is good and the 12MP TrueDepth lens is an excellent selfie camera. Plus, you can transform virtually any selfie into portrait mode with a tap.\nThis is unquestionably the best set of cameras we have ever seen on an iPhone base model. They're not as good as those on the iPhone 15 Pro Max, and they lack both stronger telephoto and macro capabilities. If you want that, you'll pay more, but for the price, this is all you should want or need in an iPhone that doesn't have \"Pro\" in its name.\n- Camera score: 4 / 5\niPhone 15 review: Camera samples\niPhone 15 review: Performance and specs\n- A16 Bionic\n- Is 128GB enough storage?\nIt's no surprise that Apple has paired its upgraded iPhone 15 with last year's best mobile CPU, the A16 Bionic. It's a powerful processor featuring a 6-core CPU, 5-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural engine, all backed by 6GB of RAM. It's not as powerful or, in my testing, as fast as the new A17 Pro in the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, but it provides more than enough power for most iPhone owners.\nI do wish the iPhone 15 started with 256GB of storage, but then I still remember the days when we started with just 64GB (or less!).\nIn my Geekbench 6 tests, the iPhone 15's A16 Bionic essentially matched the numbers of the one found in the iPhone 14 Pro. It also still bests Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 found in the Samsung Galaxy S23.\nNumbers are interesting, but it's real-world performance that matters. The iPhone 15 can handle pretty much any task you throw at it. I used it in a variety of scenarios, from streaming videos and web browsing to 4K video editing and action games.\nAsphalt 9: Legends looked great and smooth on it. One thing I did notice though is that, after a few minutes of gameplay, the back of the iPhone 15 got noticeably warm. I wonder if the aluminum body transmits that heat more readily than the A16 Bionic's original stainless steel-bodied home in the iPhone 14 Pro.\niPhone 15 (and iPhone 15 Plus) owners, though, should find little to complain about in the performance department.\n- Performance score: 4 / 5\niPhone 15 review: Software\n- iOS 17 on board\n- Contact posters\n- Lots of small and useful changes\nAll new iPhone 15 models come with iOS 17 preinstalled. It's not one of Apple's biggest mobile platform updates, but it does offer some nice quality-of-life improvements.\nSome are subtle, like the redesigned iMessage menu or new gesture-based on-screen emoji control in FaceTime. Others are bigger, like Contact Posters and the Name Drop feature that lets you share that contact information by simply moving phones within a centimeter or so of each other. The \"Bring Devices Together\" feature in AirDrop is on by default (my test units kept connecting to each other), so you might want to turn it off until you're ready to use it or fully understand it.\nEven without an always-on-screen, the aforementioned Standby feature is a nice way to charge your iPhone 15 while keeping something useful on-screen (like the time or a calendar).\n- Software score: 4 / 5\niPhone 15 review: Battery life\n- All-day battery\n- USB-C\n- Bring your own power adapter\nApple doesn't publicize battery size, but based on the promises Apple is making in the specs, nothing has really changed. The iPhone 15 is still rated for 20 hours of video playback, 80 hours of audio-only, and a 50% recharge in 30 minutes with the optional 20W charger.\nIn my tests and with mixed-use, the iPhone 15 can give you a full day of battery life, though that does not mean 24 hours. It seems to get in the range of 15 hours. I also found that recharging with a 20W adapter matched Apple's promises. I would love to see faster wired fast-charging.\nWhen it's time to recharge, you'll now use the included USB-C cable, which, unlike previous iPhone cables, features a woven covering instead of rubber and plastic. I like it.\nThe iPhone 15's battery is smaller than the one you'll find in the iPhone Plus, but it's also running what might be a slightly less efficient chip than that found in the iPhone 15 Pro. The latter now has the 3-nanometer A17 Pro, while the iPhone 15 runs a 4-nanometer A16 Bionic.\nIf battery life is more important to you, you might want to look at the more expensive iPhone 15 Pro (it's rated for 23 hours of video playback) or the larger iPhone 15 Plus, which could get 26 hours of video playback.\n- Battery score: 4 / 5\niPhone 15 review: Verdict\nApple's most affordable new iPhone no longer feels miles away from the flagship. It has the same Dynamic Island as its more expensive siblings and pairs that feature with new materials, lovely contoured edges, a powerful A16 Bionic CPU, and, yes, the USB-C port. Even the photography capabilities have been leveled up with a 48MP camera and new portrait processing capabilities. If you want a fresh iPhone 15 model, this is your most affordable and best option, and it won't make you feel too much like you're missing out.\nShould I buy the iPhone 15?\n| Attributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\n| Design | The curved edges and smooth, color-infused glass make this a most modern iPhone | 4 / 5 |\n| Display | Losing the notch and gaining the dynamic Island is a net poisitive, as is the lovely and now brighter screen. | 4 / 5 |\n| Performance | It's hard to ask for more than the A16 Bionic, unless you want the A17 Pro, and then you should be looking elsewhere. | 4 / 5 |\n| Camera | A nice big main camera leap is paired with some truly impressive computational photography | 4 / 5 |\n| Battery | Decent battery life | 4/ 5 |\n| Software | iOS 17 is a solid update | 4 / 5 |\n| Value | Apple is finally giving you more for you money. | 4 / 5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou want a small iPhone\nThe iPhone 15 is now the right mix of size, features, and performance.\nYou want an affordable iPhone\nThis iPhone strikes a nice balance between price and cutting-edge features.\nYou want a camera upgrade\nBetween the new 48MP main camera and some excellent portrait photography capabilities, this may be a compelling upgrade for iPhone 14 owners.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou want a bigger phone\nThis 6.1-inch screen might feel cramped if you own a Pro Max or Plus.\nYou want bigger zoom\nThe 2x optical zoom that uses the main camera's center 12 MP doesn't quite compare to 3x optical zoom on the iPhone 14 Pro or Samsung Galaxy S23.\niPhone 15 review: also consider\nThe iPhone 15 boasts several key upgrades over the iPhone 14, but if you're simply looking for a capable 6.1-inch iPhone to see you through the next few years, then the standard iPhone 14 is an excellent choice that's only going to get cheaper.\nGoogle Pixel 7 Pro\nFor a little bit more money, Google's latest flagship boasts a larger display and better cameras than the iPhone 15. You'll get a supremely clean take on Android, too, though it's worth noting that the Pixel 8 Pro is due to land soon.\nIf you're keen on the iPhone 15's size, camera and performance credentials, but aren't a big fan of iOS, then the standard Samsung Galaxy S23 offers similar specs in an Android-powered package.\n| iPhone 14 | Google Pixel 7 Pro | Samsung Galaxy S23 | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Price (at launch): | From $799 / \u00a3849 / AU$1,339 | From $899 / \u00a3849 / AU$1,299 | From $799.99 / \u00a3769 / AU$1,249 |\n| Display: | 6.1-inch Super XDR (2532 x 1170) OLED | 6.7-inch adaptive 120Hz (1440 x 3120) LTPO OLED | 6.1-inch (2340 x 1080) OLED |\n| Cameras: | 12MP wide, 12MP ultrawide | 50MP main, 48MP 5x zoom, 12MP ultra-wide macro | 50MP wide, 12MP ultrawide, 10MP telephoto |\n| Battery: | 3,279mAh | 5,000mAh | 3,900mAh |\nHow I tested the iPhone 15\nI tested the iPhone 15 in New York City and at home.
