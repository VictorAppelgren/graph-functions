Generate Key Takeaways\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem didn\u2019t much like how she was portrayed in last week\u2019s episode of South Park. Especially biting was the scene at the end in which Noem\u2019s heavily made-up face falls off and runs away as if it were alive.\n\nIf she didn\u2019t appreciate that, Noem probably won\u2019t be too thrilled with an alternate credits sequence posted to the South Park social media accounts today. In it, the gun-toting DHS Secretary enters a pet store and, through frosted glass, is seen shooting the dogs therein. (The scene references Noem\u2019s admission in her memoir that she killed her own family dog because she considered the pet \u201cuntrainable.\u201d) The post calls it \u201cthe Paramount+ version of the end credits scene.\u201d\n\u2022 None \u2018South Park\u2019 Production To Be Overseen By George Cheeks In Post-Merger Paramount Structure\n\nBefore last week\u2019s episode \u2014 titled \u201cGot a Nut\u201d \u2014 aired, Noem condemned the portrayal after the South Park crew teased stills of the show.\n\n\u201cIt never ends, but it\u2019s so lazy, to make fun of women and how they look. Only the liberals and the extremists do that. If they wanted to criticize my job, go ahead and do that. But clearly they can\u2019t. They pick something petty like that,\u201d she said.\n\nLikely in response, the profile pictures on the show\u2019s social media accounts were later changed to show Noem\u2019s melting face in animated form.\n\u2022 None Everything We Know About Prime Video's \u2018Legally Blonde\u2019 Prequel Series \u2018Elle\u2019\n\u2022 None Everything We Know About 'Only Murders In The Building' Season 5 So Far\n\u2022 None Everything We Know About \u2018The Love Hypothesis\u2019 Movie So Far\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.

      "text": "South Park is not done taking shots at the Donald Trump administration, and its latest target is Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.\nThe official social media accounts for the animated series shared photos of this week\u2019s episode titled \u201cGot a Nut,\u201d in which an animated version of Noem appears fully stylized and fully glammed, posing with a gun in front of a Border Patrol van.\nIn the episode, Mr. Mackey loses his job and \u201cdesperately tries to find a way to make a living,\u201d reads the logline.\nMackey is the school counselor at South Park Elementary and is seen in the preview photo with a vest portraying an ICE agent next to Noem.\nThe second episode of Season 27 is set to premiere at 10 p.m. ET Wednesday on Comedy Central.\nWatch on Deadline\nAnother still from the episode shows Cartman in bed watching a video on his laptop and looking surprised:\nNoem is the former governor of South Dakota and a faithful Trump supporter, who got national attention when she published a memoir in which she confessed to having shot and killed her family dog for being \u201cuntrainable.\u201d Although for many, this would have been the end of her political career, in the Trump administration, that doesn\u2019t apply, and MAGA loyalist Noem found herself on the national stage again.\nNoem was nominated by then-President-Elect Trump to serve in his cabinet as DHS Secretary and was confirmed by the Senate in January. Since serving in that role, Noem has carried out Trump\u2019s immigration policies in deporting undocumented immigrants. Noem is often referred to as \u201cICE Barbie\u201d or \u201cHomeland Barbie\u201d for appearing glammed up and never missing a photo opportunity.\nSouth Park premiered Season 27 on July 23, mocking Trump in bed with Satan, which seemingly offended the White House resident. Despite the President of the United States lashing out at the long-running animated series, other areas of his administration embraced the parody. The official DHS X account used a still of the upcoming episode to promote a job opening:\nThe new South Park episode mocks Trump once again, getting a little touchy with Satan:\nExcellent \ud83d\udc4d\nYup going so political is going to do the show wonders. Just as Colbert how that ended up.\nEr, have you ever seen South Park? It\u2019s been political for nearly 30 years.\nThe SP guys just reupped their contract for $1.5B. They still get paid either way and they own their IP so they can still make the show and put it own their platform. They have one of the best deals in the business. They\u2019ll keep ripping 47 more and more viciously until he sues them. They\u2019re playing the long game here.\nYep, once they start shooting one way, instead of both ways, they start shooting themselves in the foot.\nThe president will enforce its cancellation, so they will take off the gloves for the rest of the run?\nI think the fact that the 1st & 2nd episode both aired is such an accomplishment that if they do get cancelled, it is still job well done!\nLOL, bro at this point SP is one of the most successful shows in history. Twenty eight years. 329 episodes. More money for those guys than they could ever spend. They\u2019ve destroyed absolutely anyone and everyone that they\u2019ve ever wanted to go after.\nThey can do anything they want\u2013there\u2019s really no way for them to be significantly more successful than they already are.\nSo, ssssshhhhhhhhh.\nClearly they don\u2019t get Comedy Central in your Siberian Trollbot call center.\nMaybe you missed the huge numbers South Park is doing and the $1.5 billion dollar streaming deal they just signed, even the President is raving about the show, it\u2019s on the right track.\nYou really think politics is what\u2019s behind the collapse of late night tv talk shows?\nFascist says what?\nYou only enjoy trolling the government when it\u2019s a democrat in office, snowflake?\nYou\u2019re right. We should all preemptively relinquish our first amendment out of fear of offending the Complainer in Chief.\nYou\u2019ve never seen this goddamn show in the last 25 years and have no clue as to what it\u2019s about"

      "text": "South Park has seemingly reacted to Kristi Noem\u2018s criticism of the animated series after the Comedy Central show spoofed her.\nOn the most recent episode of South Park, Noem is portrayed as someone heavily invested in her looks, with a whole glam team prepping her hair and makeup.\nThe animated series pokes fun at this melting off her made-up face after a while, forcing her to call in a makeup crew to help her get back together.\nAhead of the \u201cGot a Nut\u201d episode airing, which featured Noem, South Park teased stills of the show with her portrayel.\nRELATED: \u201cWell, I Finally Made It\u201d: JD Vance Responds To His Blistering \u2018South Park\u2019 Debut\nWatch on Deadline\nDuring an appearance on Glenn Beck\u2019s podcast, Noem shared her thoughts about the show mocking her looks.\n\u201cIt never ends, but it\u2019s so lazy, to make fun of women and how they look. Only the liberals and the extremists do that. If they wanted to criticize my job, go ahead and do that. But clearly they can\u2019t. They pick something petty like that,\u201d she said.\nTo continue to highlight the work of South Park\u2019s animators, the social media accounts recently changed the profile pictures (PFP) to show Noem\u2019s melting face. Both Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) now feature Noem in animated form.\nRELATED: \u2018South Park\u2019 Trolls Donald Trump\u2019s DHS Ahead Of ICE Barbie Episode: \u201cWait, So We ARE Relevant?\u201d\nThe South Park episode also featured Noem shooting puppies, including Superman\u2019s Krypto dog, which referenced the DHS Secretary admitting in her memoir to killing her own family dog due to them being \u201cuntrainable.\u201d\nIf only South Park would do her justice\u2026killing her dog is the least of her vileness. She is a petrological liar. She lied about he father\u2019s death being the cause of her quitting college\u2026she quit to get married and have a baby BEFORE he died in a farm accident\u2026but used it to get the sympathy vote to win her election. In congress she voted more liberal than John McCain and Mitt Romney. She hates Trump\u2026but uses him for his money. She shut down South Dakota just like Newsom did but lied about it. SD got MORE money for covid per capita than most states. Check out her Executive order 2020-12. She stopped the use of HCQ\u2026she used the National guard for contact tracing and quarantined South Dakotans\u2026BUT LIED ABBOUT IT ALL\u2026.but because she was a siren you all believed her.\nYes, sociopaths often start demonstrating their depravity by abusing animals\nIt\u2019s Not only liberals that mock women\u2019s appearance. Trump has often mocked women\u2019s appearance.\nIt\u2019s what she deserves for killing her own dog. She\u2019s the worst of the worst.\nI sure hope she doesn\u2019t have dogs, cats or other animals right now. Those poor creatures are not safe with that psychopath.\nLAZY?!\nKnow what\u2019s LAZY?\nShooting a puppy instead of training it."
