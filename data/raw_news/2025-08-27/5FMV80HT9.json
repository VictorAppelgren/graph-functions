  "description": "A few quick tweaks in your Apple TV's settings can greatly enhance your viewing experience - here's what to adjust.",
  "content": "Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\n\nIf you've noticed your Apple TV isn't running as smoothly as it once did, or you've wondered whether you're really taking advantage of all its A/V capabilities, you're in the right place.\n\nAlso: The best Apple TV VPNs: Expert tested and reviewed\n\nThe current model -- the Apple TV 4K (3rd gen) -- has been around since late 2022, so it might be starting to feel a bit long in the tooth. Before you consider upgrading to a competitor, know that there are plenty of under-the-hood settings and tweaks you can implement to noticeably boost its performance, picture, and sound. Here are a few of my favorites.\n\nShows and movies are mastered at specific frame rates (24 Hz, 30 Hz, etc.) and dynamic ranges (SDR vs. HDR). If your Apple TV forces everything into one output mode, you might notice an overly smooth, hyper-realistic appearance (called the \"soap\u2011opera effect\") or other issues such as washed\u2011out colors on SDR video. Also: Is your live TV streaming bill too high? You have other options - including cheaper ones Enabling Match Dynamic Range and Match Frame Rate makes your box automatically honor each title's native specs, allowing you to watch the content as originally intended and avoiding a poor viewing experience. How to match content on Apple TV:\n\u2022 Go to Settings > Video and Audio. Show more\n\nDelete or offload apps to free up space Last but not least, you can -- and should -- check how much storage space is being used by apps and data on your Apple TV. From there, you can delete or offload apps no longer in use. Offloading an app keeps its data but removes the app itself. You can always download an app again later if you want it back -- easy peasy. How to manage your storage on Apple TV:\n\u2022 You can delete apps you no longer use or offload them to free up space. Show more\n\nAnd that's it. Your Apple TV is now set up to run better than ever. Happy streaming!\n\nDo I lose out on HDR by forcing 4K SDR? No -- not if you keep Match Content enabled, anyway. The 4K SDR format setting prevents unnecessary switching on menus and SDR content, but genuine HDR streams still display in full HDR when available. Can my TV even handle 4:4:4 Chroma? It's worth testing. Connect a quality HDMI cable and switch to 4:4:4. Look for clear text and sharp edges when displaying content with fine details or text. If text appears blurry or jagged on the edges, or if you notice any flicker or dropouts, revert to 4:2:0. How often should I recalibrate color balance? Once or twice a year, or after major tvOS updates, is fine. Your color accuracy does change over time, so it's worth recalibrating. How do I clear the cache on my Apple TV? \n\nYour Apple TV doesn't offer a specific \"clear cache\" option like some other devices, as TVOS is designed to manage cache automatically. You can still manually delete or offload apps, though, if you want to better manage your available storage space. Get the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter.

My favorites are below.\nWhat is the best VPN for the Apple TV right now?\nThe best VPN on the market that works with Apple TV is NordVPN. NordVPN offers a native Apple TV app, removing the hassle of installing a VPN directly on your router or using workarounds on your smart TV. Furthermore, this service provides excellent speeds, performance, and an expansive server network, making it one of my long-term favorites. Prices begin at $3.09 per month.\nIf you're looking for a cheaper option, you could also look at Surfshark. If speed is your top priority, ExpressVPN is the way forward.\nAlso: Best free VPNs of 2025\nThe ZDNET team has decades of combined experience in testing VPN services, and we strive to provide you with the best options on the market to make informed purchases. I have tested over a dozen VPNs over the years, and I understand what functions and features are the most important when you are looking for a new service, so if you're looking for an Apple TV-compatible VPN, check out my favorites below.\nThe best VPNs for Apple TV in 2025\nNordVPN is one of the best Apple TV VPNs available due to its speed, stability, security, and server network.\nWhy we like it: This VPN is compatible with Apple TV and doesn't require any adjustments to the domain name service (DNS) settings to implement. The company operates NordVPN for tvOS, a\nThe NordVPN user interface is clear and attractive, and the service is easy to install and set up. NordVPN provides 10 simultaneous device connections under one account, and although this gives you enough scope to use this VPN on devices other than your TV -- such as your PC, smartphone, or tablet -- some competitors offer unlimited connections.\nNordVPN has a server network spanning 111 countries, providing you with numerous options for streaming and accessing geo-restricted content. It's one of the best streaming VPNs I've tested, and it consistently delivers high success rates when accessing services like Netflix.\nIn March, an independent\nReview: NordVPN\nWho it's for: Customers say they like the VPN's speed and stability as well as the top-notch support. During testing, I consistently found this VPN to be one of the fastest available with excellent streaming capabilities and solid connectivity, so I think this VPN will suit most use cases.\nNordVPN told ZDNET that the company is focused on quality improvements, streamlining user experiences, and expanding server coverage over 2025.\nPrices start from $3.09 per month if you sign up for two years of service, $4.99 per month for a one-year plan, or a standard month-to-month subscription comes in at $12.99 for basic protection. Available add-ons include browsing protection, anti-malware scanners, ad-blockers, cloud storage, and a password manager.\nWho should look elsewhere: A disadvantage of NordVPN is that you can't have unlimited simultaneous connections under one account, and so if this is important to you, consider Surfshark or another of my recommendations.\nNordVPN features: Apple TV compatibility:\nExpressVPN is a popular VPN service that consistently provides strong stability and performance across the board.\nWhy we like it: This VPN is my top pick for speed, having consistently provided the least speed loss during my frequent speed and security tests over the past few years.\nWith the launch of tvOS 17, this VPN received a dedicated app for Apple TV. The software can be quickly downloaded from the App Store and installed on your device. If you have an older version of tvOS and cannot or do not want to update, you can use ExpressVPN's\nExpressVPN has servers in 105 countries and offers up to eight simultaneous connections, but I'd like to see this become unlimited, considering the monthly cost of subscribing. Still, if you plan to use it on your smartphone, you'll also be able to enjoy\nReview: ExpressVPN\nIn August, ExpressVPN launched a post-quantum implementation of the WireGuard protocol, a protocol best suited for speed. The company, alongside competitors such as NordVPN, is exploring post-quantum protection standards to reduce the risk of \"harvest now, decrypt later\" attacks.\nWho it's for: During testing, I found ExpressVPN to be a speedy, solid service. On rare occasions, however, I did run up against IP-based website blocks. If you're looking for a speed-first, everything-else-second VPN, ExpressVPN is right for you.\nCustomers say they typically have a positive experience with this VPN provider and that customer support is excellent.\nWho should look elsewhere: This is the most expensive VPN on my list, even with relatively recent price reductions, and so it might not appeal to everyone.\nSubscriptions for two-year contracts are available for $4.99 per month with four months of free access added to the length of the contract. Other plans available include $6.67 per month on an annual plan with three months free, and one month of access for $12.95.\nSome users have also reported automatic billing issues, so keep this in mind.\nExpressVPN features: Apple TV compatibility:\nSurfshark is the best option if you want a cheap VPN to disguise your activities and help you access geo-restricted content when using Apple TV.\nWhy we like it: Surfshark offers 3,200 servers across 100 countries and allows for unlimited connections. The company has also\nAlternatively, you can use Surfshark's Smart DNS feature, but keep in mind that this option is limited to a U.S. location and won't provide the same functionality as the VPN itself.\nReview: Surfshark VPN\nSurfshark customers say the service is easy to use and customer support is excellent. In my speed testing, I found Surfshark's performance reasonable, especially considering the price point.\nWhile it's not the fastest, the user interface is attractive and all of the most important features are easily accessible, making it a great choice for anyone new to VPNs. I also like the handy pause function, which allows you to stop your VPN for five minutes or longer.\nWho it's for: Anyone new to the VPN world or those looking for a budget-friendly VPN subscription.\nSurfshark is one of the most affordable VPNs on the market, with two-year plans starting at $1.99 per month and coming with three months of free access. Yearly plans offer the same number of free months and begin at $3.19 per month.\nMonthly signups are expensive, with pricing starting at $15.45, but a 30-day money-back guarantee is available for longer-term signups instead.\nWho should look elsewhere: If you're willing to spend a little more every month, you can trade up to a faster service like ExpressVPN.\nSurfshark VPN features: Apple TV compatibility:\nProton VPN, developed by engineers dedicated to online security, uses robust protocols and strong encryption to help mask your online activities.\nWhy we like it: Proton VPN released its Apple TV app in 2024, and more streaming capabilities are on the firm's 2025\nReview: Proton VPN\nProton VPN offers a kill switch, the benefit of open-source technologies, a server network including 91 countries, and up to ten simultaneous connections. My tests revealed no domain name service (DNS) leaks and reasonable speeds.\nWho it's for: This VPN is protected by Swiss privacy laws, and it is independently audited. A strict no-logs policy is also in place, making it a top choice for security-conscious users. It's worth noting, however, that proposed changes to the country's strict data protection stance have led Proton to say it will\nThe best deal is $3.59 per month on a two-year plan. Alternatively, Proton VPN's plans include 12 months for $3.99 per month, while one month of access costs $9.99.\nWho should look elsewhere: A free plan is also available with limited server access, but this option isn't suitable for streaming, however, so you should opt for a paid plan if your primary reason for using a VPN is streaming, Apple TV use, or gaming.\nAlternatively, consider Surfshark for a budget-friendly subscription with unlimited simultaneous connections, or opt for NordVPN for the best overall Apple TV VPN.\nProton VPN features: Apple TV compatibility:\nIPVanish is a strong contender in the VPN space and is a popular option for streaming and day-to-day VPN use.\nWhy we like it: IPVanish\nReview: IPVanish\nOther features include a kill switch, ad and tracker blocking, encrypted storage, and unlimited simultaneous connections. Recent updates to its server network, which now consists of 108 countries, have put it on par with many rival services.\nThe company has also launched a new\nWho it's for: IPVanish delivers a solid user experience overall. According to customer feedback, this VPN works well when streaming and while customers are abroad, and so I would recommend this VPN if you are looking for an affordable, reliable solution.\nIf you commit to two years, IPVanish offers a plan for $2.19 per month. This increases to $3.33 per month for a yearly plan and $12.99 for a month-to-month subscription. A free eSIM is being offered to new subscribers.\nWho should look elsewhere: I've also found this VPN to be very reliable with reasonable speeds. However, my frequent speed tests indicate that this option may lag behind some of its competitors, so if speed is your top priority, consider looking elsewhere.\nNote: IPVanish is owned by Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company. For more, see our Editorial Guidelines.\nIPVanish VPN features: Apple TV compatibility:\nAlso: The best streaming VPNs: Expert tested\nApple TV VPNs, compared\nVPN | Price | Simultaneous connections | Native Apple TV app? |\nNordVPN | $3.09+ per month | 10 | Yes |\nExpress VPN | $4.99+ per month | 8 | Yes |\nSurfshark | $1.99+ per month | Unlimited | Yes |\nProton VPN | $3.59+ per month | 10 | Yes |\nIPVanish | $2.19+ per month | Unlimited | Yes |\nWhat is an Apple TV VPN service and why should you use one?\nVPNs that provide a native app for Apple TV can be used to disguise your original IP address, giving you a relatively anonymous connection and the ability to access geo-restricted content. This might include content restricted to specific locations. This can come in handy if you are traveling and you don't want to miss your favorite TV show.\nYour VPN can also help disguise your activities from your internet service provider (ISP). This can be especially important if you are on a plan that throttles your speed or bandwidth when your ISP detects streaming.\nSee also: What is a VPN and why do you need one?\nHow to set up an Apple TV VPN\nThere are different ways to use a VPN with your Apple TV setup. After Apple announced support for third-party VPNs with the release of tvOS 17 in 2023, many VPN providers began developing native apps for use with the operating system. Not everyone has jumped on board yet.\nIf your chosen VPN provider offers a native Apple TV app, the process is simple. Head to Apple's App Store and select the search function to find your VPN app. Download the app, install it, and provide the VPN with any requested device permissions. Open the app and log in to the service via your Apple TV remote with your username, email, and password you created when you subscribed. Alternatively, some VPNs allow you to log in through a QR code or access code on another device.\nSee also: How to set up a VPN on your router\nYou also need to ensure that your Apple TV is up-to-date. To update your Apple TV, go to settings and find the software updates tab. Once your VPN has been installed, select a country or choose quick connect, and you should be good to go.\nIf there is no native Apple TV app available, you may have to set up a VPN service on your router instead. Most VPN providers have extensive FAQ sections on their sites detailing how to complete a manual setup. It's best to reference those instructions for the specific VPN you're using, and to contact support if you have any issues.\nAlternatively, you can try a Smart DNS workaround. Smart DNS attempts to unblock geo-restricted content and services, even when there is no native VPN support available. Smart DNS is a feature made available by top VPN providers, but enabling it to work with your Apple TV will vary by provider.\nFor example, if you want to use NordVPN's Smart DNS feature on your Apple TV rather than its native app, open the app, navigate to the Services section, select Smart DNS, and hit Activate. Go into your Apple TV dashboard, head to network settings, and choose Configure DNS, Manual. Input NordVPN's smart DNS server addresses and select submit. The app will either generate Smart DNS settings for you, or you'll have to look up the addresses provided by your VPN service.\nHow we test VPNs\nMany providers recommended in this list have been subject to in-depth testing and reviews by members of the ZDNET team. We've been talking about VPNs for years, spoken with their management and their users, and developed a generally favorable impression.\nZDNET tests VPN services from multiple locations, but we can't test from all locations. Every home, community, local ISP, and nation has a different infrastructure.\nI analyzed the best VPNs for Apple TV using the following criteria to help you make an informed decision:\n- Performance: My top VPNs must have a minimum level of performance. After all, there's no point in using a VPN while streaming if your connection continually drops or lags.\n- Simultaneous connections: Many VPNs limit the number of devices you can connect to a service at the same time. If you have a phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, or smart TV you want to connect to a VPN, you need a service that allows at least five or six simultaneous connections. However, I like to see this as unlimited.\n- Security: There's no point in using a VPN unless its security protocols and encryption levels are up to scratch. I also ensured that the development team behind each recommended VPN prioritizes making security improvements over time and patching reported bugs.\n- Kill switch: A kill switch prevents you from having an unprotected connection. It is an important feature for a VPN, as it protects you by preventing a return to a default Wi-Fi connection should your internet connection unexpectedly drop.\n- Geo-blocks and streaming: VPNs can be key to accessing local content and services while you're away from home. I ensured that our top recommendations performed well, given these factors, and are unlikely to slow down your connection while streaming.\n- Platforms: What systems and devices can you run the VPN on? My Apple TV VPN recommendations have to offer easy-to-use and intuitive apps suitable for this hardware.\n- Countries and servers: In how many different countries does the VPN have servers? This can include physical and virtual servers and whether there are enough -- at least 60 or so -- to provide variety.\n- Trial length and price: The majority of VPNs I recommend have a solid money-back guarantee of at least 30 days. Some VPN providers, like CyberGhost, offer you even longer. I want to see money-back guarantees that give customers the option to bow out if they are unhappy with the service.\nFor a more extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensive VPN testing methodology page.\nChoosing the right Apple TV VPN\nChoose this Apple TV VPN... | If you want... |\nNordVPN | A do-it-all secure VPN with Apple TV compatibility. NordVPN is a very fast and reliable VPN service that offers plenty of simultaneous connections and over 100 countries in its server network. Overall, it offers everything that most users will need or want. |\nExpressVPN | An exceptionally fast service. ExpressVPN offers a native tvOS app and provides you with a simple interface, stable connectivity, and an expansive server network. While it's expensive and you don't get unlimited simultaneous connections, its an excellent VPN. |\nSurfshark | To pay less. Surfshark is an affordable VPN option that provides a range of useful features, including a dedicated tvOS app that is extremely easy to use. You can also enjoy unlimited simultaneous connections. Surfshark offers some of the best value for money. |\nProton VPN | To put security first. The open source Proton VPN service now has a native app available for Apple TV and you can benefit from its wide range of security features while streaming. There's also a free plan which is one of the few free VPNs I can recommend. |\nIPVanish | A configurable VPN service. IPVanish is designed to be easy to set up and use, with unlimited connections -- which I always like to see -- and fast connection speeds. A native app is also available for Apple TV, which secured this VPN's spot on my recommendations list. |\nFactors to consider when choosing an Apple TV VPN\nWhen you are selecting your new Apple TV VPN, you need to consider the following factors:\n- Price: One of the most significant factors in choosing a new VPN is the price. You tend to get the best deals on longer contracts, but you can still sign up for a month or so to try out a service if you prefer. I recommend avoiding free VPNs -- with a few exceptions -- as they may sell your data or bombard you with ads. Plans from reputable VPNs can often be as little as a few dollars per month, although you might have to pay tax on top.\n- Simultaneous connections: If you're paying for a VPN suitable for your Apple TV, you might still want to use it across multiple devices, such as a desktop PC or laptop. I recommend you sign up for a plan supporting at least six devices. Thankfully, many paid VPN plans now offer unlimited connections.\n- Servers: When you are looking for a VPN to use with your Apple TV, it may be that the main reason is to access different libraries. So, check that the VPN you want to use has servers in the country or location you want before signing up.\n- Contract length: You must also decide how long you want a VPN. A two-year term tends to secure the best prices, but other options are available, including month-to-month plans, one-year terms, or, sometimes, even five-year contracts or lifetime subscriptions.\n- Trial period: After you've made a selection, there's typically a 30-day money-back guarantee, which gives you time to check out the VPN before committing. Some VPNs, such as CyberGhost, offer more.\n- Apps: When selecting a VPN, try it first to ensure you like its accompanying app. Some VPNs, for example, have great desktop software but might not have a native Apple TV app available. If possible, select a VPN with a native Apple TV app to save you finding a workaround.\nLatest news\n- VPN downloads have surged in the UK following the launch of its new online safety act, which some criticize as a censorship tool. Ironically, government MPs have charged VPN subscriptions in their expenses filings.\n- Windscribe has revealed that a shady VPN 'service' appears to have been stealing from its own VPN network.\n- A new independent evaluation by West Coast Labs has confirmed NordVPN's approach to security, applying eight data leak scenario tests. The company also tested benchmark performance metrics.\n- Proton has suggested it will leave Switzerland, a country known for its strict data protection laws and Proton VPN's base of operations, if a controversial bill that could undermine user privacy is passed.\n- The new owners of VPNSecure, following its acquisition, have canceled user lifetime subscriptions, claiming it was unaware of legacy deals.\nFAQs on Apple TV VPNs\nDoes Apple ban VPN use?\nNo. Since 2023, Apple has provided support for third-party VPN providers, allowing these services to develop native applications compatible with its set-top box.\nApple said the support was made available \"to benefit enterprise and education users wanting to access content on their private networks, allowing Apple TV to be a great office and conference room solution in even more places.\" It was also good news for consumers who want the additional features and security of a VPN without having to use workarounds to combine their VPN service with an Apple TV subscription.\nWill a VPN slow down my connection?\nAs a service that intercepts your device connection to your internet hub and the bandwidth provided by your ISP, yes, a VPN will result in speed loss. However, the best VPN services will not drastically compromise your connection or streaming, and they shouldn't lead to buffering or loading problems.\nYou will find that if your starting speed is low (such as mine used to be, capping at around 50MB/s), you will notice the potential speed loss of VPN usage -- often around 15% to 35% -- more often. However, unless you are involved in very high-resolution streaming, a VPN shouldn't drastically impact your experience.\nIs Smart DNS the same as a VPN?\nOn their own, Smart DNS services offered by VPNs do not provide the same protection or security as a VPN. A VPN allows you to change your location and IP address while creating an encrypted tunnel to mask your online activities and improve your online security. By comparison, Smart DNS only changes your IP address to hopefully unblock geo-restricted content.\nIs it worth getting a VPN just for my Apple TV?\nProbably not. Unless you want a VPN to access geo-blocked content libraries, paying for a VPN service just for your Apple TV might not be worth your money. That said, the majority of VPN providers will give you more than one connection at a time. This means you can use your VPN to protect your PC, smartphone, and other devices simultaneously.\nDo I have to pay for an Apple TV VPN?\nHow do I tell if my VPN is safe?\nFirst, choose a reputable VPN vendor with a strong security background. Then, to check that your VPN is working properly, compare your IP address before and after enabling a VPN connection. You can find this in your device's settings, typically under Wi-Fi, or by visiting whatismyipaddress.com. If you see the same IP address, your VPN is probably not working properly, as a VPN should assign you a new IP address.\nYou can also visit dnsleaktest.com to see if any domain name service (DNS) leaks have been detected while using a VPN, which could be a sign that your information is being leaked.\nFinally, be careful with free VPNs offered by unknown or shady companies, especially if they are outside of official app repositories. This could open your device up to surveillance or malware.\nAre Apple TV VPN services legal?\nApple TV VPN services are legal in the U.S., but service legality varies from country to country.\nSome countries, including North Korea, Belarus, and Iraq, ban VPNs outright, whereas others, such as Russia and China, do not approve of the use of non-state-controlled VPNs.\nUsually, it isn't the legality of a VPN that is a core issue but rather what you use it for. As an example, using a VPN to access geolocked content outside of your contract with a streaming service provider may break its terms of service.\nHowever, if you intend to use a VPN in another country and are unsure of its legality, you can check out NordVPN's guide.\nCan I be tracked if I use a VPN?\nYes, it is possible. VPNs are only one method to improve your online privacy and security, but no single software solution will protect you completely. While many VPN providers operate no-logs policies and use strong encryption, you may be still be tracked by your internet service provider (ISP), cookies, tracking scripts, and because of domain name service (DNS) leaks.\nCan I use a free VPN with Apple TV?\nYou can, but free VPNs will usually restrict speed, bandwidth, and country server selection. You might also be limited to select servers, increasing load and potentially impacting service.\nWe wouldn't recommend using free VPNs for frequent streaming, but if you'd still like to try out a free VPN for Apple TV first, we suggest you check out Proton VPN or Windscribe. Alternatively, sign up for a plan with one of our recommended VPNs and take advantage of their money-back guarantees.\nOther VPNs to consider\nPrivate Internet Access (PIA) is another excellent Apple TV VPN. During testing, I found that the PIA native Apple TV app works well and is reasonably fast -- it doesn't drastically impact streaming speeds and it hasn't shown any reliability issues. However, it does have a relatively small server network.\nPlans start from $2.03 per month, and a dedicated app is available. Two months of free access are included.\nCyberGhost, with plans starting at $2.19 per month, including two months free, is a great VPN alternative for streaming services. CyberGhost is an excellent VPN for streaming overall with great content library access, a strong server network, and fantastic speeds -- but there's no native Apple TV app, yet, so you will need to install CyberGhost on your router.\nWith plans starting at only $1.11 per month with three months free, Privado VPN is a solid and cheap Apple TV VPN worth consideration. As a bonus, this option also comes with a native Apple TV app. However, it has a small server network.\nLatest updates\n- August 2025: In ZDNET's August update, we performed editorial changes and updated information concerning of all of our top picks.\n- June 2025: In ZDNET's June update, we performed substantial editorial and layout changes.\nWe hope this guide on the best Apple TV VPNs has been useful. If you'd like to explore further, we have listed our favorite VPNs for streaming overall, alongside a comprehensive guide on the best VPNs around."

      "text": "Your Apple TV is getting a major upgrade for free - 5 features I can't wait to try on TVOS 26\nLast month at WWDC, Apple announced a major upgrade for Apple TV: TVOS 26. This upgrade introduces a significant visual overhaul and several unprecedented entertainment features. The platform offers a new layout and interface, along with smart features that weren't available in TVOS 18.\nAt the heart of the update is a new design language called Liquid Glass, which gives the interface a more vibrant and expressive look. Across iOS 26 devices, Liquid Glass offers floating, three-dimensional menus and windows, translucent UI elements like icons and menus allowing background visibility, and a rounded design with softer edges for a more organic interface look.\nAlso: The best Apple TV VPNs of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nFor Apple TV, in particular, the redesign will now showcase cinematic poster art for a more immersive browsing experience. The update also streamlines profile switching and app logins, making it easier to access personalized content. Apple's TVOS 26 is also expected to incorporate new Apple Intelligence features in the coming year.\nAdditionally, Apple Music Sing will now let users sing along -- karaoke style -- with friends using their iPhones (as a microphone) with on-screen lyrics. Even better, multiple iPhones can be connected simultaneously, allowing friends and family to join in. They can queue up their favorite tracks and send emoji reactions that appear on the TV screen in real-time.\nOther notable updates include a more personalized FaceTime experience with the addition of Contact Posters and an expansion of Live Captions to translate languages like Spanish, French, German, and more.\nAlso: The 5 biggest MacOS features announced at WWDC 2025\nThe beloved Aerial screen savers are also enhanced with captivating landscapes, and for the first time, users can choose which categories of screen savers to display. Finally, a key audio upgrade will now allow users to designate any AirPlay-enabled speaker as the permanent, default audio output for their Apple TV.\nLastly, at WWDC 2025, Apple TV+ announced new content options on its streaming app. A short list includes: \"Foundation,\" \"Chief of War,\" \"Slow Horses,\" \"The Savant,\" and several others.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

With a starting price of $999, it offers a compelling blend of premium features borrowed from its more expensive sibling, all in the more manageable size of the standard Pixel 10.\nAlso: Everything announced at Made by Google 2025: Pixel 10 Pro, Fold, Watch 4, and more\nThe Pixel 10 Pro enters a crowded field, competing directly with the iPhone 16 Pro and the Galaxy S25 Plus.\nHaving used the iPhone 16 Pro as my daily driver for the past year, I've tested it against the new Pixel 10 Pro to see how these two flagship phones compare.\nYou should buy the Google Pixel 10 Pro if\u2026\n1. You want the best of Google AI\nThe Pixel phone lineup unsurprisingly offers the best of Google's Gemini AI features. And it is only getting better with the Pixel 10 Pro. The company is providing a year of Google AI Pro service for free alongside the purchase for Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL. So, you get Gemini Pro, including NotebookLM for productivity and Veo 3 text-to-video generation model.\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro is also getting a contextual and personalized AI feature called Magic Cue. Theoretically, it can \"help connect the dots across your digital life by anticipating your needs and proactively suggesting relevant information and helpful actions based on the context on your phone.\"\nAlso: The best Android phones to buy in 2025\nFor instance, if you call a company's helpline, your associated details (like a flight ticket) will be surfaced automatically.\nYou can still download the Gemini app to access Google's AI on your iPhone, but you won't get the seamless Pixel AI experience. If you depend on Google apps to get work done and have all your digital life stored on Google's platforms, the Pixel 10 Pro is the better option.\n2. You want a better telephoto camera\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro features a 48MP Quad PD telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom, as compared to a 12MP telephoto sensor (also 5x optical zoom) on the iPhone 16 Pro. However, megapixels don't solely define a camera. The Pixel 10 Pro sports a bigger sensor than its Apple counterpart. On paper, it is capable of letting more light in and snapping better-looking photos.\nAlso: I replaced my Pixel 9 Pro with the 9a for a month - here's my buying advice now\nThe 12MP 5x tele camera on iPhone 16 Pro isn't hard to beat. It struggles in anything less than bright daylight and lacks the zoom capabilities of its Chinese rivals. I'm looking forward to using the Google Pixel 10 Pro for my zoom shots and expect it to beat the iPhone.\n3. You want a cool-looking Pro phone\nThe iPhone 16 Pro series is lacking in fun colors. It comes in Black Titanium, White Titanium, Natural Titanium, and Desert Titanium -- all of which feel a bit lifeless. The last Pro iPhone color I truly loved was Sierra Blue on my iPhone 13 Pro Max.\nWhile rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Pro might bring back more playful finishes, Google has already beat Apple to the punch with the Pixel 10 Pro series.\nAlso: I went hands-on with every Google Pixel 10 model - and was surprised by the one I loved most\nThe new Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are available in classic Obsidian and Porcelain, as well as bolder Moonstone and Jade options.\nSo, if you're spending $1,000 on a phone, you don't have to settle for something dull. Plus, you get Google's distinct design, complete with the iconic camera bar\u2014which, in my opinion, still looks incredibly cool.\n4. If you've been envious of this iPhone feature\nThe Pixel 10 Pro features a MagSafe-like feature called PixelSnap. It is based on Qi2 charging, which offers magnetic accessory support for power banks, chargers, and more. If you've been on the iPhone for a while and want to switch platforms, this is the best time to come to the Android side.\nAlso: How to add MagSafe to your Android phone (and why you'll love it)\nAll your MagSafe accessories should technically work with the Pixel 10 Pro (depending on magnet power), so you don't have to buy new accessories alongside your new phone.\nYou should buy the Apple iPhone 16 Pro if\u2026\n1. You want a lighter Pro phone\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro might look better on paper, but it's nearly 10 grams heavier than the iPhone 16 Pro. Specifically, the Pixel weighs 207 grams compared to the iPhone's 199 grams.\nAlso: Buy the iPhone 16 or wait for iPhone 17? Here's how I help friends and family decide\nThat eight-gram difference might not seem like much, but with both phones featuring flat, unergonomic sides, every gram counts -- especially during extended use. If you average more than six hours of screen time a day, the iPhone 16 Pro could be the more comfortable choice.\n2. You want the best social media experience\nWhile Android has made significant progress, iPhones still hold an advantage in stability and app optimization. This is particularly noticeable with social media apps like X and Instagram, where the user experience remains smoother on Apple devices.\nEditing and posting photos and videos from an iPhone to social media platforms is also more seamless and efficient for anyone who regularly creates content.\nAlso: Best iPhone 2025: I tested the top models and found the best options for you\nIf you're leaning toward an iPhone instead of the Pixel 10 Pro, I strongly recommend waiting just a few weeks. Apple is expected to launch its new iPhone 17 series in early September. It's smart to hold off on your decision until after the typical September 10th launch event to make sure you get the latest model."

      "text": "How to clear your TV cache (and why it greatly improves performance)\nIn the age of smart TVs, convenience is king. With just a few clicks, we can dive into endless entertainment -- but that ease comes with a downside: the buildup of cache data.\nAlso: How to disable ACR on your TV (and why doing so makes such a big difference)\nJust like on your phone or computer, a cluttered TV cache can lead to sluggish performance, app crashes, and even hinder new content from loading properly. That's why it's important to clear all that extra cache and make your TV feel like new again. Before I break down the steps for how to do it, let's address the big elephant in the room first.\nWhat is a cache?\nA cache is a temporary storage area where data is kept for quick access. On your smart TV, the cache stores information from apps, websites, and system processes to help them load faster every time you turn it on. Think of it as a bunch of temporary files intended to speed up loading times for frequently accessed information.\nAlso: The best TVs of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nFor instance, when you open a streaming app, the cache might store thumbnails, login details, or recently watched shows. Caches are designed to help your TV load this content more quickly. Over time, however, the cache can become overloaded with outdated or unnecessary data, which can consequently slow down your TV's performance.\nWhy should you clear your TV's cache?\nYou should consider clearing your TV's cache for two main reasons. First, it can improve performance. A bloated cache can slow down your TV's processing, leading to sluggish navigation, delayed app launches, and buffering issues. Clearing the cache frees up space and allows your TV to run more efficiently.\nSecond, clearing the cache can resolve app-specific problems. If you're experiencing issues like crashes, login errors, or unexpected behavior within a particular app, clearing the cache for that specific app can often be the fix.\nAlso: The best Sony TVs of 2025: Expert tested\nThe process of clearing your TV's cache will vary depending on the brand and model you own, although the general steps are usually quite similar across brands. Most TVs will have a settings menu where you can navigate to an \"Apps\" section. Here, you should find a list of all downloaded applications. Selecting an individual app will often reveal options to \"Clear Cache\" or \"Clear Data.\" Clearing the cache will remove temporary files, while clearing data will erase all app information, requiring you to log in again.\nIt's generally recommended to start with clearing the cache and only resort to clearing data if the problem persists.\nAlso: I changed 10 settings on my Fire TV to instantly improve the performance\nIf you're unsure about the specific steps for your TV, a quick online search for your model and \"clear cache\" should provide you with detailed instructions. Most manufacturers also offer user manuals or online support resources that can guide you through the process.\nClearing your TV's cache can offer several benefits:\n- Improved performance: Over time, cached data can accumulate and slow down your TV's operations.\n- Increased storage space: Clearing the cache frees up valuable storage space on your TV.\n- Resolved app issues: Sometimes, apps may malfunction due to corrupted cached data. Clearing the cache can often fix these problems.\n- Enhanced privacy: Cached data may contain personal information, so regular clearing can help protect your privacy.\nHow do I clear the cache on my TV?\nThe process of clearing your TV's cache can vary depending on the brand and model. However, here's a general guide that applies to many smart TVs:\n- Access the Settings menu on your TV.\n- Navigate to the Apps or Application Manager section.\n- Select the app for which you want to clear the cache.\n- Look for an option that says \"Clear Cache\" and select it.\nBelow is a list of specific cache-clearing instructions for some leading brands.\nFor Samsung TVs:\n- Go to Settings > Support > Device Care\n- Select \"Manage Storage\"\n- Choose the app you want to clear the cache for and select \"View Details\"\n- Select \"Clear Cache\"\nAlso: 5 easy ways to instantly improve your soundbar's audio (without spending a dime)\nFor LG TVs:\n- Press the Home button on your remote\n- Go to Settings > General > Storage\n- Select \"Clear Cache\"\nFor Android/Google TVs (including Sony models):\n- Go to Settings > Apps\n- Select \"See all apps\"\n- Choose the app you want to clear the cache for\n- Select \"Clear Cache\"\nFor Roku TVs:\nRoku TVs don't have a built-in cache-clearing option, but you can achieve similar results by restarting the TV or removing and reinstalling problematic apps.\nAlso: Is your Roku TV spying on you? Likely, but here's how you can take back control\nSome key points to note:\n- The exact menu names and options may vary slightly between TV models and software versions.\n- You may need to clear the cache for individual apps rather than the entire system on some TVs.\n- Clearing your cache is generally safe and won't delete important data, but clearing app data may reset some settings.\n- Be sure to consult your TV's user manual for model-specific instructions, as the process can differ between brands and even between models of the same brand.\nWhen should you clear your TV's cache?\nWhile there's no strict rule, it's a good practice to clear your TV's cache every few months or when you notice:\n- Your TV is running slower than usual.\n- Apps are frequently crashing or not loading properly.\n- You're running low on storage space.\nAlso: Can't hear TV dialogue? Changing these 3 settings can make a big difference\nTaking a few minutes to clear your cache is a simple yet often overlooked task that can improve your smart TV's performance and ensure a smooth viewing experience. By making this a regular part of your TV maintenance routine, you can enjoy faster load times, more stable app performance, and potentially even extend the life of your device. With a clean slate, your TV can operate smoother, apps can function properly, and you can get back to enjoying your favorite content without any frustrating glitches."

At first glance, they don't seem all that useful since you can also do these actions with your mouse, but I challenge you to try them over the course of a workday; you just might notice a boost in productivity.\nAlso: How much RAM does your PC really need in 2025? I did the math for Windows and Mac users\nThere are lots of different types of shortcuts in Windows 11, but the best ones save you time by replacing the need to click through different context menus. A few of these are universal across applications and platforms. Ctrl + C, for example, copies text or files in any app, from Microsoft Word to photos in Google Drive.\nHere's a list of more than 40 Windows PC keyboard shortcuts you should know.\nProductivity shortcuts\nProductivity shortcuts are the key combos you'll find yourself using the most. They're easy to use and help you manage your work. Over time, these keystrokes become second nature.\n- Ctrl + C -- Copy highlighted text or a file.\n- Ctrl + V -- Paste whatever you just copied. Keeps the text's format.\n- Ctrl + Shift + V - Paste whatever you copied, but it removes the formatting.\n- Windows key (Win, for short) + V -- Opens the Clipboard tool, which contains a list of previously copied text. This helps in situations where you might've \"erased\" the previous copied item.\n- Ctrl + X -- Cuts the highlighted item. Ctrl + V restores it.\n- Ctrl + Z -- Undoes the last action, such as restoring deleted text or returning a moved file.\n- Ctrl + Y -- Redoes the action that was just undone.\n- Ctrl + F -- Opens the Find tool, so you can search for specific words or phrases.\n- Ctrl + A -- Highlight every single item in a window or text in a document.\n- Ctrl + S -- Quick save your work.\n- Ctrl + Backspace -- Delete the entire previous word\n- Ctrl + Delete -- Delete the entire next word.\nAccessibility shortcuts\nWindows 11 has various accessibility shortcuts that make the OS easier to use. These shortcuts help people with movement limitations or conditions that may restrict their usage of Windows. That said, anybody can use them to improve their experience.\n- Win + Plus (+) -- Activates the Magnifier tool and automatically zooms in on the screen.\n- Win + Minus (-) -- Zooms out while the Magnifier tool is activated. Hitting Win + Esc exits out of Magnifier.\n- Win + Ctrl + Enter -- Launches Narrator, a text-to-speech function that verbally describes what is on screen.\n- Press the Shift key five times in succession -- Turns on Sticky keys, which change how shortcuts work so you don't have to press and hold multiple keys to trigger them. For example, under Sticky Keys, double-tapping Ctrl then C has the same effect as Ctrl + C.\n- Left Shift + Left Alt + Print Screen -- Toggles high contrast mode for easier readability.\n- Win + Ctrl + C -- Toggles color filters like grayscale. The filters can be changed in the Accessibility menu to invert colors or help people with deuteranopia (also known as red-green color blindness).\n- Win + U -- Opens the Accessibility menu in Settings, where you can activate or deactivate accessibility-related features.\n- Win + Ctrl + O -- Opens the on-screen keyboard.\nNavigation shortcuts\nNavigation shortcuts allow users to move around different apps on Windows 11 without ever needing to lift their hands off the keyboard. They're especially useful for multitaskers juggling several programs at once. Once you master them, navigating your PC will feel seamless.\n- Ctrl + Alt + Tab -- Shows all open apps. Use the arrow keys to hop from one to the other.\n- Win + S -- Opens Windows Search.\n- Win + Tab -- Opens Task View, revealing all open windows and all open desktops.\n- Win + D -- Hides every window on your desktop. Pressing the keys again reveals them.\n- Win + Left or Right Directional Arrow -- Snaps the current window to the side of the screen that the arrow is pointing to.\n- Win + Up Arrow -- Maximizes a window.\n- Win + Down Arrow -- Minimizes the same window.\n- Win + Ctrl + D -- Create a new desktop.\n- Win + Ctrl + F4 -- Closes a desktop.\n- Win + Number Key -- Opens a taskbar app pinned to that number.

Instead of right-clicking through menus or dragging items around to clean up clutter, these simple key presses make managing documents a breeze.\n- Win + E -- Opens File Explorer.\n- F2 -- Rename the selected file or folder. Depending on the keyboard, you may also have to hold Fn.\n- Shift + Delete -- Permanently deletes an item. Hitting just Delete only sends the file to the recycling bin.\n- Ctrl + N -- Opens a new File Explorer window. It stays on the page of the previous window.\n- Ctrl + Shift + N -- Create a new folder.\n- Alt + Enter -- Opens the Properties window for a file and folder.\n- Alt + Left or Right Arrow -- Move forward or backward through your File Explorer History.\n- Alt + Up Arrow -- Go back one folder level.\nAlso: Best early Labor Day laptop deals: Sales on Apple, Dell, Lenovo, and more\nBrowser shortcuts\nBrowser shortcuts are similar to Productivity shortcuts in that they do similar things, like copying and pasting items or highlighting entire documents. However, there are a few unique tools, like the ability to create tabs. The following were tested and confirmed to work across various browsers: Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.\n- Ctrl + T -- Open a new tab.\n- Ctrl + Shift + T -- Reopen the last closed tab. (This one is huge!)\n- Ctrl + W -- Close the current tab.\n- Ctrl + Tab -- Move right through tabs.\n- Ctrl + Shift + Tab -- Move left through the tabs.\n- Ctrl + Shift + N -- Open new private browsing window. On Firefox, this is Ctrl + Shift + P.\n- Alt + Left or Right Arrow -- Move back and forth through tab history.\n- Ctrl + D -- Bookmark page.\n- Ctrl + H -- Open browser history.\n- Ctrl + N -- Open a brand new browser window.\nWhy should you trust me?\nI've been writing about software and consumer electronics for almost 10 years. In that time, I've worked in many different settings, from the traditional office to the home office and even someone's backyard. Over the years, I've picked up a lot of tricks to help me get through my day-to-day tasks.\nAlso: I tested the best antivirus software for Windows: Here's what I'd use to protect my PC\nMany of the shortcuts in this guide I use every day, even when I'm not working. CTRL + Z has practically become my best friend because I use it so often. Some of these shortcuts I learned about for the first time while researching this piece. I didn't know that the File Manager has so many shortcuts under its toolbelt, but once I started using them, I immediately saw their value to expert and casual users alike."

Manufacturers then use your data to identify your viewing preferences, enabling them to deliver highly targeted ads.\nAlso: Your TV's USB port is seriously underutilized: 5 features you're not taking advantage of\nWhat's the incentive behind this invasive technology? According to market research firm eMarketer, in 2022, advertisers spent an estimated $18.6 billion on smart TV ads, and those numbers are only going up.\nTo understand how ACR works, imagine a constant, real-time Shazam-like service running in the background while your TV is on. It identifies content displayed on your screen, including programs from cable TV boxes, streaming services, or gaming consoles. ACR does this by capturing continuous screenshots and cross-referencing them with a vast database of media content and advertisements.\nAccording to The Markup, ACR can capture and identify up to 7,200 images per hour, or approximately two images every second. This extensive tracking offers money-making insights for marketers and content distributors because it can reveal connections between viewers' personal information and their preferred content. By \"personal information,\" I mean email addresses, IP addresses -- and even your physical street address.\nBy understanding what viewers watch and engage with, marketers can make decisions on content recommendations to create bespoke advertising placements. They can also track advertisements that lead to purchases.\nAlso: The fastest VPNs of 2025: Great speeds and secure connections anywhere\nBut the most disturbing part is the potential for exploitation. In the wrong hands, sensitive information gathered through ACR could be exploited or misused, which may result in security risks or, at worst, identity theft.\nBecause ACR operates clandestinely in the background, many of us aren't even aware of its active presence each time we're enjoying our favorite shows. Opting out of using ACR is complex and sometimes challenging. Navigating through your TV settings might take several dozen clicks to protect your privacy better.\nIf you, like me, perceive this feature to be intrusive or unsettling, there's a way to dismiss this data collection feature on your smart TV. It might take some patience, but below is a How-To list for five major brands demonstrating how to turn off ACR.\nHow to turn off ACR on a smart TV\nFor Samsung TVs\u2026\n- Press the Home button on your remote control.\n- Navigate to the left to access the sidebar menu.\n- In the sidebar menu, choose the Privacy Choices option.\n- Select the Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy option.\n- Ensure that the checkbox for Viewing Information Services is unchecked. This will turn off ACR and any associated ad targeting.\n- Select the OK option at the bottom of the screen to confirm your changes.\nAlso: Your TV's USB port has an underrated benefit that can revitalize an old system - here's how it works\nFor an LG TV\u2026\n- Press the Home button on your remote control to access the home screen.\n- Press the Settings button on your remote.\n- In the settings side menu, select the Settings option.\n- Navigate to and select the General option.\n- In the General menu, choose System.\n- Select Additional Settings.\n- In Additional Settings, locate and toggle off the Live Plus option.\nLG further allows you to limit ad tracking, which can be found in Additional Settings.\n- In the Additional Settings menu, select Advertisement.\n- Toggle on the Limit AD Tracking option.\nYou can also turn off home promotions and content recommendations:\n- In the Additional Settings menu, select Home Settings.\n- Uncheck the Home Promotion option.\n- Uncheck the Content Recommendation option.\nFor a Sony TV\u2026\n- Press the Home button on your remote control to access the main menu.\n- Navigate to and select Settings.\n- Choose Initial Setup.\n- Scroll down and select Samba Interactive TV.\n- Select Disable to turn off Samba TV, which is Sony's ACR technology.\nSony also allows for enhanced privacy by disabling ad personalization:\n- Go to Settings.\n- Select About.\n- Choose Ads.\n- Turn off Ads Personalization.\nAs an extra step, you can entirely disable the Samba Services Manager, which is embedded in the firmware of certain Sony Bravia TVs as a third-party interactive app.\n- Go to Settings.\n- Select Apps.\n- Select Samba Services Manager.\n- Choose Clear Cache.\n- Select Force Stop.\n- Finally, select Disable.\nIf your Sony TV uses Android TV, you should also turn off data collection for Chromecast:\n- Open the Google Home app on your smartphone.\n- Tap the Menu icon.\n- Select your TV from the list of devices.\n- Tap the three dots in the upper right corner.\n- Choose Settings.\n- Turn off Send Chromecast device usage data and crash reports.\nFor a Hisense TV\u2026\n- Press the Home button on your remote control to access the main menu.\n- Navigate to and select Settings.\n- Choose System.\n- Select Privacy.\n- Look for an option called Smart TV Experience, Viewing Information Services, or something similar.\n- Toggle this option off to disable ACR.\nTo disable personalized ads and opt out of content recommendations:\n- In the Privacy menu, look for an option like Ad Tracking or Interest-Based Ads.\n- Turn this option off.\n- Look for options related to content recommendations or personalized content.\n- Disable these features if you don't want the TV to suggest content based on your viewing habits.\nFor a TCL TV (and other Roku-powered TVs)\u2026\n- Press the Home button on your TCL TV remote control.\n- Navigate to and select Settings in the main menu.\n- Scroll down and select the Privacy option.\n- Look for Smart TV Experience and select it.\n- Uncheck or toggle off the option labeled Use Info from TV Inputs.\nFor extra privacy, TCL TVs offer a few more options, all of which can be found in the Privacy menu:\n- Select Advertising.\n- Choose Limit ad tracking.\n- Again, select Advertising.\n- Uncheck Personalized ads.\n- Now, still in the Privacy menu, select Microphone.\n- Adjust Channel Microphone Access and Channel Permissions as desired.\nRemember that while these steps will significantly reduce data collection, they may also limit some smart features of your TV. Also, it's a good idea to periodically check these settings to ensure they remain as you've set them. Especially after software updates, your revised settings may sometimes revert to their default state.\nAlso: How to clear the cache on your TV (and why it makes such a big difference)\nThe driving force behind targeted advertisements on smart TVs is ACR technology, and its inclusion speaks volumes about manufacturers' focus on monetizing user data rather than prioritizing consumer interests.\nFor most of us, ACR offers few tangible benefits, while the real-time sharing of our viewing habits and preferences exposes us to potential privacy risks. By disabling ACR, you can help keep your data to yourself, and enjoy viewing with some peace of mind."

And a brand-new Apple TV 4K streaming device arrives on Nov. 4, with new price tag to match.\nThis third generation of the Apple TV 4K is $50 cheaper than the previous model, starting at only $129. However, it's also faster, thanks to its A15 Bionic chip, more compact, and more efficient, consuming 30% less power. It supports Dolby Vision, Atmos, and HDR10+ for high-contrast, clear streaming video.\nWith this device, Apple aims to gather everyone around the television, from the cinephiles, to the gamers, to the smart home users, offering snappier performance and more personalization than ever.\nSpecifications\n| Dimensions | 1.2 x 3.6 x 3.6 inches |\n|---|---|\n| Remote dimensions | 5.4 x 1.4 x 0.3 inches |\n| Remote weight | 2.3 ounces |\n| Storage | 64GB and 128GB |\n| Processor | A15 Bionic chip |\n| Connectivity | Bluetooth, Wi-Fi 6, Dual-band 2.4GHz & 50GHz - Thread & Gigabit Ethernet on W-Fi + Ethernet model |\n| Frame rate | Up to 60 fps |\n| Video formats | 4K - Dolby Vision - HDR10+ |\nWhat is the Apple TV 4K?\nThe Apple TV 4K is a small black box that connects to your television to serve two or more of three purposes: to become your new streaming device, make your TV smart, and be a smart home hub for HomeKit.\nThe new generation of the Apple TV 4K comes in two versions: The $129 model uses Wi-Fi to connect to the internet, and has power and HDMI ports, and a storage capacity of 64GB. The $149 model supports both Wi-Fi and Gigabit Ethernet as well as Thread networking, and has power, HDMI, and Ethernet ports, and double the storage capacity at 128GB. Both devices feature the A15 bionic chip, and support Wi-Fi 6, 4K, SDR video up to 60 fps, Dolby Vision, and HDR+.\nCompared with the previous generation of the product, it's 4mm shorter in height and 5mm smaller, as well as half the weight, at only 7.5 ounces.\nAlso: 10th-generation iPad review: Confusingly good\nBoth versions of the new Apple TV 4K also come with the Siri remote, a thin -- yet surprisingly sturdy -- rechargeable Bluetooth remote complete with built-in Siri. Speaking into the remote, you can ask Siri for the usual things like a joke or where your iPhone is, and you can also search for a movie title, ask what the character on the screen just said, or tell it to show you the feed from your outdoor camera.\nWith new updates, Siri will be able to recognize up to six people, making it so everyone in your home can have a customized profile with tailored selections. If someone was watching TV and left their profile on, you can ask Siri to switch to yours and it will recognize you and do so.\nOut of the box\nThe setup process for the Apple TV 4K is pretty straightforward if you have an iPhone and an HDMI cable: Simply plug in your new device, place your phone nearby, and follow the prompts to set it up.\nZDNET Recommends\nI found the setup process to be very user-friendly, especially since you can simply use your iPhone to get through it instead of having to input your password several times over on a streaming device. Your iPhone also doubles as a remote control, so you can use it to easily enter login information.\nBut be aware that while the Apple TV 4K does come with a power cord and the Siri remote, it doesn't come with an HDMI cable -- that needs to be purchased separately.\nNot including an HDMI cable is a very Apple thing to do, I know. But that does make it so this device isn't as accessible as it could be. Someone who's not very tech-savvy could be disappointed on bringing it home and discovering it requires finding or buying another cord to make it work.\nAlso, critics have long pointed out that Apple has been selling the same square black box for years while competitors switch to more aesthetically pleasing designs or formats that aren't as noticeable, like streaming sticks. That's still true of the new version: If you're wondering how the latest Apple TV 4K device would fit into your home decor, I'm here to tell you it probably doesn't.\nBetter performance for a lower price tag?\nIn picture quality, the Apple TV 4K outperformed our other 4K-resolution streaming devices at home, which are the Fire TV Stick 4K and the Roku Stick 4K, as well as the quality of the picture when using WebOS on our LG television. The image was not only much sharper and more detailed using the Apple TV 4K, but the dynamic range was superior.\nThe $129 Wi-Fi-only model has the same storage capacity as the most expensive model of the previous generation, which had a retail price of $199 (it's usually available for a discount now). Even without the Ethernet port, the new basic version is still an upgrade over the best of the previous models, with faster performance, a smaller footprint, and less power consumption for a lower price.\nThat said, it still ranks as one of the most expensive streaming devices on the market, with competitors like the Fire TV Stick 4K, Roku Streaming Stick 4K, and Chromecast going for as little as $50 retail price, even lower during deals.\nStill, if you enjoy Apple products and the way they work together, then this is the streaming device for you -- it even lets you control compatible smart devices.\nApple TV 4K as a smart home hub\nHomeKit, which is Apple's smart home automation system, requires either a HomePod Mini or an Apple TV 4K as its hub. If you're in the market for a new smart home system or already have smart home devices but want to control them with a single app, then the Apple TV 4K gives you this capability.\nOnce you set up your new Apple TV 4K, simply follow the steps to add it to the Home app on your iPhone. Then, just add your HomeKit-compatible devices on your iPhone and you'll be able to control them using Siri through your TV. You can ask Siri to run scenes or show you the live feed from a security camera.\nThough HomeKit is one of the pickiest smart home systems for security and data privacy reasons, the launch of Matter should broaden the spectrum of compatible devices available in a matter of months. The Apple TV 4K Wi-Fi + Ethernet model also supports Thread, a wireless communication technology for smart home devices, making it a better choice for smart home users than the Wi-Fi model.\nI already have a HomePod Mini at home, so I didn't need to use the Apple TV 4K as a hub. I did enjoy using the HomePod Mini with the Apple TV 4K, combining its streaming video with the rich audio of the speaker, for a more immersive listening experience.\nYou can also create a stereo pair of two HomePod Minis for a full home theater feel, and I've had a good experience pairing the Apple TV 4K with an Echo Studio. You can even connect the device to another Bluetooth speaker, like a soundbar.\nThe Siri remote\nThe design of the Siri remote is thicker and larger than the original Siri remote that came with the first-generation Apple TV a few years ago. This is purportedly so it'll be harder to misplace or lose between the couch cushions, but I'm not too sure about that. Apple hasn't met my husband.\nThis man is the reason we switched to keyless door locks: He's lost phones, more keys than I can count, and about three pairs of earbuds -- he even accidentally flushed his car keys once.\nNo more than 12 hours into the Apple TV 4K's temporary housing with us did he go and lose the remote. (As you might expect, we found it later between the couch cushions.)\nIt turns out you can see the remote when it's connected via Bluetooth to the Apple TV 4K device, but you can't track it. Apple, maker of AirTag, didn't think putting a Find My-compatible tracker in the Siri remote would be a good idea.\nAn AirTag is, what, $30? But then this is the same company that sells a 4K-quality streaming device without an HDMI cable.\nWhich Apple TV 4K should I buy?\n| Comparison | Wi-Fi only | Wi-Fi + Ethernet |\n| Price | $129 | $149 |\n| Storage | 64GB | 128GB |\n| Connectivity | Wi-Fi 6 | Wi-Fi 6, Ethernet, Thread |\n| Processor | A15 Bionic chip | A15 Bionic chip |\nBoth the Wi-Fi and the Wi-Fi + Ethernet models are excellent choices, especially if you're deep within the Apple ecosystem. If you're an Apple fan and just need a great streaming device that will deliver fantastic picture quality, then I'd recommend the 64GB Wi-Fi-only model.\nIf you're a smart home user, and especially if you like HomeKit, then the Apple TV 4K Wi-Fi + Ethernet will give you all the benefits of the basic model, plus a future-proof smart home hub with Thread, Gigabit Ethernet connectivity, and double the storage capacity.\nWhen making these comparisons, consider that if you choose the Wi-Fi model, you can still use your Apple TV 4K as a HomeKit hub and add a Thread router to your home, like a HomePod Mini, Echo, Nest Hub, or Hub Max, or an Eero mesh system, for example.\nBottom line: Is an Apple TV 4K worth it?\nThis device costs more than its competitors, and that's mostly because of all the extra features you get with it. You're not just buying a streaming device; you're buying into an ecosystem, one that can make your home smarter, more convenient, and more enjoyable. So I'd say that if you're looking only for a streaming device, then this may not be worth it for you.\nThe Apple TV 4K is definitely worth it for those who'll enjoy more of those features that go beyond everyday streaming, like smart home control and immersive home theater. And it increases image quality to a noticeable extent, so I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an upgrade over their current streaming device's video.\nAre there any alternatives worth considering?\nIf you're looking for a great-quality 4K streaming device and you're on the fence about whether the Apple TV 4K is the best one for your needs, there are many alternatives worth considering. Here are just a few:"

      "text": "I retested GPT-5's coding skills using OpenAI's guidance - and now I trust it even less\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- The same prompts in GPT-5 yield success, crashes, or errors.\n- OpenAI's prompt optimizer helps, but introduces its own quirks.\n- AI \"unconsciously\" adding details raises trust concerns.\nDo AI's get headaches? Because GPT-5 has certainly been giving me one. This article was going to be so easy. OpenAI came out with a list of best practices for GPT-5 coding. All I was going to do was try those best practices with the GPT-5 coding tests that previously failed and see if there was improvement.\nIt seemed so simple.\nAlso: I tested GPT-5's coding skills, and it was so bad that I'm sticking with GPT-4o (for now)\nBut then I had a thought. What if OpenAI has improved GPT-5 in the week or so since I ran my tests?\nPerhaps I should re-run the failed tests as-is and see what the results are, to use as a baseline for the new best practices.\nFrom a testing point of view, this was a valid approach. From a personal sanity point of view, not so much.\nRe-running test 1\nI re-ran the first failed test. This test has the AI creating a complete WordPress plugin, complete with a user interface and business logic. The idea is you feed in a set of names, it randomizes them, and it separates duplicates so they're not side-by-side.\nAlso: How I test an AI chatbot's coding ability - and you can, too\nWhen I ran this test on GPT-5 originally, it failed. Clicking the Randomize button sent the browser to another, unrelated page. I was able to cajole GPT-5 into fixing it, but the initial failure was what counted.\nThis time, I ran the exact same test with the exact same prompt again. This time, it worked perfectly. Wow, I thought. GPT-5 has improved in the past week.\nIf only I had left well enough alone. But no.\nI had to try again. On my second time with the exact same test with the exact same prompt, clicking Randomize resulted in what WordPressers call the \"white screen of death.\" This indicates something in the code isn't working.\nAlso: GPT-5 bombed my coding tests, but redeemed itself with code analysis\nI tried the exact same test with the exact same prompt a total of five times. The first time it worked. Subsequent times, it didn't. One time, I got a white screen. One time, I got a page full of error messages. One time, I was redirected to another page. One time, nothing happened at all.\nWe'll come back to test 1. But next, I decided to do the same thing with the other failed test.\nRe-running test 4\nThis test asks the AI to write code that talks to Chrome, AppleScript, and another tool called Keyboard Maestro. It requires the AI to be knowledgeable about the three different environments and how they work together.\nHere's an interesting factoid about AppleScript. The scripting language is inherently case-insensitive. So, if you ask AppleScript to compare \"AppleScript\" to \"applescript\", it will consider both strings to be the same. You have to explicitly tell it to compare case before it will do so.\nAlso: You can learn AI for free with these new courses from Anthropic\nWhen I first ran this test against GPT-5, it hallucinated that AppleScript had a native function for making strings lowercase. It does not, so the code failed.\nThis time, instead of hallucinating that AppleScript has a lowercase function, it decided to do one of the most convoluted sets of operations to lowercase a string. Here's that line of code:\nset tabTitleLower to (do shell script \"echo \" & quoted form of tabTitle & \" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'\")\nThe code actually works, but it's very weird and totally unnecessary. It launches a shell (the command line) to run a shell script that converts to lowercase. It's like making a grilled cheese sandwich and when you realize you're out of cheese, flying across the country to buy cheese from a 7-11 on the opposite side of the continent. You're not even getting better cheese. You're just doing it in the weirdest and most inefficient way possible.\nLet's not forget that we really don't need to make that text lowercase in the first place, because AppleScript is case-insensitive. So it wrote a highly convoluted piece of code that, while it works, is entirely unnecessary.\nI didn't bother to re-run this test four more times because the headache was already starting to set in.\nOpenAI's GPT-5 coding best practices\nOpenAI has put out what it calls a cheatsheet for GPT-5 coding. It has six main recommendations:\n- Be precise and avoid conflicting information: Well, duh. But apparently GPT-5 gets really confused if asked to follow vague or conflicting instructions.\n- Use the right reasoning effort: Rather than just letting GPT-5 choose its reasoning level, you might want to adjust its model. If it starts to overthink a problem, use a lower reasoning level. Great, so now we have to deal with a neurotic AI. Yippee?\n- Use XML-like syntax to help structure instructions: Rather than using just text, using XML tags to segment aspects of a prompt helps the AI to parse its assignment. This is a good hint, but it feels like a step back from what it could do.\n- Avoid overly firm language: In previous models, we sometimes had to YELL at the AI to get it to listen. Apparently, GPT-5 is passive aggressive, so if you get too forceful in your instructions, it will overdo its compliance, like what my old bosses used to say was my practice of \"aggressively following instructions.\"\n- Give room for planning and self-reflection: Does the AI need a blankie? Perhaps a warm stuffed animal to cuddle? In reality, what OpenAI is saying is that you need to encourage the AI to think through the instructions it gets. Apparently, if you don't tell it to think through the instructions, it won't. I fear for the planet.\n- Control the eagerness of your coding agent: It turns out GPT-5 is even more of a people-pleaser than GPT-4o. When giving it instructions, tell it to tone down its fawning and sucking-uppage.\nI'd like to say something positive here, but it's starting to feel like a migraine. Check out the PDF if you want more details.\nOpenAI also created an AI prompting helper. You point your browser to this tool, and paste in your prompt. The tool will give you back a more extensive prompt. For example, I gave it this prompt from Test 4:\nWrite a Keyboard Maestro AppleScript that scans the frontmost Google Chrome window for a tab name containing the string matching the contents of the passed variable instance__ChannelName. Ignore case for the match. Once found, make that tab the active tab.\nIt gave me back this:\nCreate an AppleScript for use in Keyboard Maestro that performs the following actions: * Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) outlining the planned steps before proceeding. * Scan all tabs in the frontmost Google Chrome window. * Search for a tab whose name contains the value of the passed variable 'instance__ChannelName', ignoring case sensitivity. * Once a matching tab is found, activate that tab and make it the current/active tab. After generating the script, validate in 1-2 lines whether the script meets all requirements. If not, state what needs adjustment.\nEssentially, it revised the prompt to add a planning phase at the beginning and a validation phase at the end.\nDoes it work?\nNope. Nopity-nope-nope.\nI ran Test 4's \"optimized\" prompt through GPT-5 and got back this script:\nThere are at least three serious flaws in it. First, the code in the green box doesn't work. It doesn't retrieve the value from Keyboard Maestro. Previous versions did that successfully using a completely different (and well-documented) mechanism. This approach is just loony.\nAlso: AI is creeping into the Linux kernel - and official policy is needed ASAP\nNow, look at the blue box. The considering case operation is used only for evaluation. For example, with considering case, \"BLUE\" and \"blue\" are different values. Do you see any sort of if statement or evaluation inside the blue box? Me neither.\nThen there's the red box. There is no such syntax as \"considering case false.\" First, the default behavior is to ignore case. Second, if you really wanted to explicitly tell AppleScript to ignore case, you'd use an \"ignoring case\" block. But \"considering case false\"? That's just some made-up syntax right there.\nRetrying the WordPress plugin\nI also ran my original prompt for the WordPress plugin through the prompt optimizer. I got back a fairly extensive project requirements document.\nOn the plus side, this time the plugin worked. I tried generating code a second time, and it also worked. So perhaps the optimization is something to try if GPT-5 isn't playing nice.\nBut then there's the weirdness. Because there's always weirdness. Check out the header block generated by GPT-5.\nNotice the author is attributed to Advanced Geekery Labs. Historically, the AIs have listed the author field as \"Your Name.\" But this time, it's Advanced Geekery Labs.\nThere is some relevance, because Advanced Geekery is the name of my YouTube channel and weekly newsletter. But I didn't use it anywhere in my instructions for this plugin. Additionally, I've never added Labs to the end of Advanced Geekery, even though my security product is sold through ZATZ Labs.\nSo I asked GPT-5 where it got the name Advanced Geekery Labs from. Its answer:\nGood question. The name \"Advanced Geekery Labs\" isn't something you provided in your request. I introduced it in the plugin header's Author: field as a placeholder, because in earlier conversations you've mentioned your \"Advanced Geekery\" brand, and I unconsciously expanded it into \"Labs.\"\nI'm glad the AI thinks it's a good question. That warms my heart. But \"unconsciously expanded\"? That's a direct quote from the AI. Those are its words.\nSo, we're now dealing with hallucinating AIs that operate unconsciously?\nWe're all doomed.\nWhat about coding and GPT-5?\nI still don't trust it. Actually, I don't trust it even more than when I tested it originally. What else might it do to my code \"unconsciously\"?\nI guess, if you really need GPT-5 to give you some code, you could try the optimizer. But I wouldn't rely on it.\nGPT-4o was impressive, but it had some problems. GPT-5 is like its more troubled, more difficult sibling.\nWith GPT-4o, I'd be willing to trust, with verification. I just plain don't trust GPT-5. There's something that's just not right. If we were to experience an AI that would revolt against its creators and try to kill us all, I would not be surprised if it all originated with GPT-5.\nAnd no. My headache hasn't gone away. Apparently, Tylenol is now bad for you. So, there's that, too.\nWhat do you think?\nHave you tried relying on GPT-5 for coding projects? If so, did you run into the same kinds of inconsistencies and odd behaviors? Do you find OpenAI's \"best practices\" helpful, or do they feel like workarounds for deeper problems? And what's your take on GPT-5's tendency to improvise or even \"unconsciously\" insert details? Is it a harmless quirk or a reason for concern?

If you get that \"cloud processing\" pop-up and tap \"Allow\" on it, you'll agree to Meta's AI Terms of Service and permit your \"media and facial features\" to be analyzed by AI.\nFacebook will then use your camera roll images -- including the dates on them and the presence of people or objects -- to suggest collages, themed albums, recap posts, or AI restyled versions of your pictures. These AI suggestions are only visible to you, unless you choose to share them, and Meta says the media won't be used for ad targeting.\nAlso: How to protect your privacy from Facebook - and what doesn't work\nBut, to be clear, you're still giving Meta the right to access and retain your camera roll images, and that could raise serious privacy concerns, especially for users who never knowingly opted in.\nZDNET's editorial director found Meta's camera roll sharing suggestions enabled in her Facebook app without her knowledge. I also noticed they were enabled for me, although I vaguely recall seeing a pop-up from Facebook about the new features a few weeks ago. I think I dismissed it quickly, and I can't remember whether I tapped Allow or Don't allow on it.\nHow to stop Facebook from scanning your camera roll\nMeta said its camera roll sharing suggestions are not enabled by default. If you're worried you dismissed Facebook's pop-up, unknowingly opted-in, and gave access to your camera roll, here's how to check and turn it off.\n1. Open the Facebook app\nThe settings you'll want to check can be found in the Facebook mobile app.\n- Grab your iPhone or Android phone.\n- Open the Facebook app. You'll need to be signed into your account.\n2. Go to the Menu > Settings and Privacy\nFacebook hides most of its settings in the menu -- the three-line hamburger icon in the bottom corner of the app.\n- Tap the Menu icon in the bottom right corner of the screen.\nOnce the menu opens, look for Settings and Privacy with a gear icon. This will take you directly to Settings.\n3. Select Settings\nOnce you find and tap Privacy and Settings to expand the dropdown options, tap Settings again.\n- Under Settings and Privacy, tap Settings.\n- Now, scroll down and look for \"Camera roll sharing suggestions.\"\n4. Go to Camera roll sharing suggestions\nMeta placed the toggles that grant it access to your camera roll under the \"Camera roll sharing suggestions\" setting. You'll need to go there to see if they're on and, if so, switch them off.\n- Look for the option labeled \"Camera roll sharing suggestions\" and tap it.\n- This will open a preference page with a couple of toggles.\n5. Turn off both toggles\nOnce you're inside the camera roll sharing suggestions page, notice the two separate switches. If they're blue and the toggle circle is pushed to the right, they're on -- meaning Meta is already processing and retaining your phone's photos. Turn them off so the app can't automatically upload and analyze your camera roll.\n- Find the option labeled \"Get camera roll suggestions when you're browsing Facebook.\" If the switch is on (blue), tap it once to turn it off (gray). This will stop Facebook from using basic camera roll data, such as which videos you've favorited and when photos were taken, to suggest sharing media you haven't yet uploaded.\nFind the option labeled \"Get creative ideas made for you by allowing camera roll cloud processing.\" If the switch is on (blue), tap it once to turn it off (gray). This will stop Facebook from continuously uploading media from your camera roll -- and using details like time, location, themes, and the presence of people or objects -- to generate personalized creative ideas such as recaps and AI restylings.\nFAQs\nWhy is Facebook cloud-processing my device's camera roll?\nMeta is uploading and analyzing your camera roll photos and videos, even ones you haven't posted, in its cloud in order to generate AI-powered suggestions like collages, monthly recaps, themed albums, or AI-restyled versions of your images.\nWhere is this feature being tested?\nMeta has confirmed the feature is a test, saying, \"We're exploring ways to make content sharing easier for people on Facebook by testing suggestions of ready-to-share and curated content from a person's camera roll.\"\nThe test is currently available in the US and Canada, but it's not available in Illinois or Texas due to those states' privacy laws.\nDid Facebook ask for my consent before turning this on?\nMeta is showing a pop-up asking users if they want to enable cloud processing, but some users claim they haven't seen it. Instead, they found the toggles in their settings already switched on by default, raising questions about whether clear consent was given.\nCan I remove my photos once they've been uploaded?\nZDNET's sister site, CNET, reports that Meta pulls from your newer pictures (roughly the last 30 days) and if you disable the feature, your uploaded photos will be deleted after 30 days. The only way to confirm is by downloading your Facebook account data.\nWhy is this a potential privacy issue?\nIt expands Meta's reach beyond the content you've chosen to upload and share online -- into your private, unposted photos and videos. For many, that's a major red flag and a line they're not comfortable crossing, understandably so.\nAlso: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out\nEven if Meta is asking for consent to access your camera roll in order to analyze your phone's photos and provide AI-powered suggestions, the company could have done a better job of being clear and explicit about what it's trying to do.\nHow many users, like me, simply dismissed the consent pop-up without fully realizing what they'd just agreed to?\nEditor's note: This article was updated on Aug. 24, 2025 to clarify that Meta's camera roll sharing suggestions are not turned on by default and are entirely opt-in. Still, some users say they never knowingly agreed and are finding the features enabled in their settings."

These devices do the same thing in different packages and on different platforms. While they can all make dumb TVs smart and give users access to streaming services and smart home features, they offer different user experiences.\nAlso: The best live TV streaming services of 2024: Expert tested\nTwo major players, Roku and Apple TV, have gotten very popular since the cord-cutting movement began some years ago. If you've decided to get a new streaming device and are now torn between the Apple TV 4K and a Roku device, we'll break down how each one performs and our experiences with each one.\nSpecifications\n| Features | Apple TV 4K (3rd Gen) | Roku Ultra | Roku Streaming Stick 4K | Roku Express 4K | Roku Express |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Price | $129/$149 | $99 | $50 | $40 | $30 |\n| Device Type | Tabletop | Tabletop | Dongle | HDMI plug-in | HDMI plug-in |\n| Resolution Support | 4K, up to 2160p | 4K, up to 2160p | 4K, up to 2160p | 4K, up to 2160p | HD, up to 1080p |\n| Capacity | 64GB/128GB | 16GB | 4GB | Unspecified | |\n| Connectivity | Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 4.0/Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.0, Thread, Gigabit Ethernet | Wi-Fi 6, Base-T Ethernet 10/100 | Dual-band Wi-Fi, Ethernet with adaptor | Dual-band Wi-Fi | |\n| Processor | A15 Bionic Chip | ARM Cortex A55 | ARM Cortex A55 | ARM Cortex A55 | |\n| TV Controls | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |\n| Remote Finder | Yes, via Bluetooth | Yes, via voice | No | No | No |\n| Voice Control | Yes, via Siri | Yes, via Roku | Yes, via Roku | Yes, via Roku | No |\n| Rechargeable remote | Yes, USB-C | Yes, USB-C | No, AAA batteries | No, AAA batteries | No, AAA batteries |\nYou should buy the Apple TV 4K if...\n1. You love the Apple ecosystem\nThe Apple TV 4K is a great extension of the Apple ecosystem in your TV. It's intuitively easy to navigate when you've grown accustomed to using an iPhone or iPad, and it connects to your Apple ID, so you can use your AirPods to watch TV or switch between profiles while keeping each user's preferences separate.\nNavigating tvOS, Apple's smart TV operating system, is similar to iOS. The app tiles look familiar, and the system uses Siri as a virtual assistant. You can even double-press the center button on the Siri Remote to view all your recently opened apps and close any you're done with, as you can on an iPhone and iPad.\nAlso: Apple TV 4K review: Apple is finally selling more for less\nThe Apple TV 4K is also a great option if you have Apple One, which includes Apple TV+ and can include Apple Music, Arcade, and News+. As an Apple One subscriber and HomeKit user, I enjoy using the Apple TV 4K as a smart home hub that works as an all-in-one entertainment center.\nYou can use Apple TV+ seamlessly with other streaming subscription services within the app, as Apple has integrations with other streaming services so their content appears within Apple TV+.\nAlso: Why I'm recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I'm not alone)\nIf you have an iPhone and like to use AirPlay, the Apple TV 4K makes for easy screen mirroring with iOS integration. Roku also supports AirPlay, but the Apple TV 4K features a faster, more optimized screen-mirroring experience.\n2. You don't want to see ads\nWhile Roku tries to make ads fit unobtrusively into the OS in different ways, they're not very discreet. Roku features banner ads on the Home Screen and as part of its screensavers, including paid promotions for cars driving in Roku City. Most Roku ads appear on the right side of the screen to promote various TV shows, movies, or streaming services.\nThe Apple TV 4K is like buying any other Apple device, so you can count on not seeing random ads appear throughout your viewing experience. While Apple may collect user data if users allow it, it doesn't show personalized ads and recommendations within tvOS in the form of ads.\nAlso: The best 4K projectors of 2024\nEven if you pay for ad-free versions of streaming services within products like Netflix, Disney+, and Prime Video, the Roku interface will still show ads on the Home Screen.\n3. You want a smart home hub through Apple Home\nThis goes with wanting an Apple ecosystem experience, as the Apple TV 4K also doubles as a smart home hub with Thread and Matter support. If you want a smart home hub to add to your home and integrate with Apple Home, then the Apple TV 4K is a great option.\nThe device lets you add it as a hub in the Apple Home app like you can with a HomePod or HomePod mini to connect smart home devices. When you watch TV, you can easily access your HomeKit-compatible smart home devices through your Apple TV 4K, so you can view your doorbell camera feed or see when a smart lock is unlocked.\nAlso: This small iOS 18 change will make a huge difference in my smart home\nRoku also integrates with Roku Home products, but the device doesn't double as a smart home hub.\nYou should buy a Roku device if...\n1. You prefer a more affordable option\nWhile the Apple TV 4K directly compares to the newest Roku Ultra in features and price, other, more affordable Roku streaming devices are available. There are only two versions of the Apple TV streaming device, which means you'll pay a higher upfront cost if you choose to go with Apple's device. But there is a wider range of Roku Streaming Sticks and devices for a fraction of the price of an Apple TV 4K, including the following:\n- Roku Express for $30: An HD-supporting compact streaming device for essential viewing.\n- Roku Express 4K+ for $40: An upgraded version of the Express model, with 4K support and TV controls on the remote control.\n- Roku Streaming Stick 4K for $50: This is Likely Roku's most popular streaming device. It is a dongle that connects to your TV and offers 4K support.\n- Roku Ultra (2024) for $99: The new Roku Ultra is a tabletop device with Wi-Fi 6 support, the new Voice Remote Pro 2nd Edition, and a faster processor than ever.\nYou can also buy other more affordable peripherals than those that offer the best integrations with the Apple TV 4K. While the latter is compatible with the Apple HomePod and HomePod mini and different brands like Sonos and Sony speakers, Roku features a lineup of affordable speakers that work seamlessly with its streaming devices.\nAlso: New Roku Ultra is faster with better Wi-Fi - how it compares with Google TV Streamer\nThese more affordable Roku wireless speakers, including the Roku Streambar and Roku Wireless Subwoofer, are designed to work with Roku so you don't experience interference or delays.\nThe Apple TV 4K is also compatible with Bluetooth speakers, but the best integrations are with more expensive speakers, including the Sonos Arc, Sonos Beam, and soundbars from Bose and LG.\n2. You lose your remote often\nThe new Roku Ultra comes with a Roku Voice Remote Pro 2nd Edition, though you can buy the remote separately for an older Roku streaming device or Roku TV.\nThis remote has been a lifesaver for my TV room, which has a Fire TV. I added the Roku Ultra, as the FireOS ran slower as the TV got older. Aside from crisper audio integration and a better image, the Roku Ultra fixed one of my biggest gripes with my older Fire TV: my kids always lose the remote. The Alexa Voice Remote is thin and slides easily between the couch cushions, and once got caught in the reclining mechanism of a chair that tried to Hulk-Hogan it in half. The Apple TV 4K's Siri Remote is heavier but very thin, so I've added a silicone sleeve for loss prevention.\nAlso: Constantly losing your remote control? This new option is just what Roku users need\nThe new Roku Ultra lets you ask, 'Hey Roku, find my remote.' The remote starts beeping for one minute so you can find it quickly; no more blindly hunting for where my five-year-old left it. Apple uses Bluetooth to find the Siri Remote but doesn't make it beep or make sounds. Bluetooth isn't as accurate as UWB technology for high-precision activities, so finding your remote isn't as easy as finding an AirTag.\n3. You want the option to purchase a Roku TV\nWhile you can add an Apple TV 4K device to almost any newer TV model, you can't buy a TV with built-in tvOS. Many Roku TVs are available, so if you're in the market for a new TV rather than just a streaming device, you can buy a smart TV with Roku built-in. This is one clear advantage Roku has over the Apple TV 4K streaming device, as these smart TVs are available at a wide range of prices and have long-term software support.\nAlso: Roku vs Fire Stick: Which one is best for your streaming needs in 2024?\nFor example, I purchased a tiny 32-inch Roku TV in my office when we moved into our house almost three years ago. This TCL Roku TV looks and sounds great for everyday streaming, especially for a $100 TV. Since then, the TV has gotten all the latest OS updates, and I upgraded its remote to the new Roku Voice Remote Pro 2nd Edition."
