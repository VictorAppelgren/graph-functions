      "feedback": "Your draft is off‑target for the Section Focus (market‑wide inflation/tech‑stock slide).  Remove every reference to Spirit Airlines, its debt, aircraft sale, or pilot furloughs (IDs Z7K8PC4G5, 3YAQ8JUPL).  Re‑frame the narrative around the key handles in the article: S&P 500 (SPX), Nasdaq 100 (NDX), 10‑yr UST yield (ust10y), Fed rate cut signal (fed_policy), and tariff escalation (tariff).  Explicitly state the causal chain: Fed’s dovish comment → 25 bp rate cut → lower fuel costs (≈ –10 bp on 10‑yr yield) → modest lift in airline and tech earnings; meanwhile Trump’s 50 % India tariff and new steel/aluminum duties → higher input costs (+5–10 bp on corporate spreads) → pressure on tech and industrials.  Quantify: SPX fell 0.31 % (–0.31 bp on index), 10‑yr yield rose to 4.23 % (+2.5 bp), core PCE at 2.9 % y/y.  Cite IDs: 3952FOSRQ (tariff ruling), 3YAQ8JUPL (Fed comment, inflation data), 3YAQ8JUPL (SPX/NDX moves).  Provide a 0–3‑week horizon: expect SPX to test 4.20 % yield level; if Fed cuts, SPX could rebound 0.5–1.0 % in next week; tariff news could push tech indices down 1–2 % if new duties materialize.  Ensure every claim has a handle, magnitude, and catalyst with inline citation.",
