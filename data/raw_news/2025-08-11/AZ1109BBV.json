  "content": "Aussie dad Shaun Skinner and his fianc\u00e9 had just started to plan their wedding for next year after 14 years together and three daughters when he died in their family home.\n\nThe 36-year-old was taking care of two of the girls on August 4 when his pacemaker, which he had been fitted with nearly two decades before, went off.\n\nHe rang fianc\u00e9 Ashlee Tyrrell about 1pm from the family home in Melbourne's south-east suburb of Rowville to alert her and she left work.\n\n'We had had no hiccups since his diagnosis at 17-years-old,' she told Daily Mail on Tuesday.\n\n'He got a pacemaker put in and everything was fine. He was going to his specialist every year.'\n\nAs she was driving home, she rang him to say she was on the way and he told her he thought it was a panic attack. She said she wasn't far.\n\n'I got a phone call from Ambulance Victoria and they told me Shaun had called an ambulance but he was terrified because he was home alone with that two daughters, so the three year old and the seven year old,' she said.\n\n'He didn't want them to be scared or alone. So I got off the phone and I called my dad who got there quickly because it was just around the corner from his work.'\n\n'Shaun lost consciousness when he knew his girls were taken care of. He waited and then he never regained consciousness again,' she said.\n\n'When the paramedics got there, my three year old was lying on her dad but I'm forever grateful because they never got to see the scary part.'\n\nMr Skinner was found lying on his bed but was moved to another room before paramedics began attempts to resuscitate him.\n\nBy the time Ms Tyrrell reached the home, he was unresponsive after what is now known to have been a fatal heart attack.\n\nThe couple, who had met while working at the manufacturer Stegbar in 2011, shared three daughters Sophie, Violet and Everly, between nine and three-years-old.\n\n'I knew then that I didn't want Shaun to come back if he wasn't going to be Shaun. I started preparing myself,' she said.\n\nParamedics had been attempting to resuscitate Mr Skinner for 45 minutes and told her they would have to stop after an hour had passed.\n\n'So 15 minutes later, they told me they were sorry, but there was nothing more they could do. I had my very sad moment. Then my brain went to my kids,' she said.\n\nMs Tyrrell's father collected her nine-year-old from school while the two other daughters said goodbye to their father.\n\n'I knew I've got to do this right, my kids need to say him to say goodbye. They need to do it now, while he still looks like Daddy,' she said.\n\n'It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do in my life.\n\n'My dad told my nine-year-old and I heard her scream from the car. Then she ran to me and I hugged her. I took her in and she said goodbye.'\n\nMs Tyrrell has taken time off work to care for her daughters until she can make sure they are well enough for her to return.\n\nShe and Mr Skinner fell in love at first sight in 2011 and were engaged a year later but held off getting married until their girls were old enough to be involved in the wedding.\n\n'We'd only just started planning so we didn't have much set. Instead, I get to plan his funeral,' she said.\n\n'Shaun was the best dad in the world. He was funny, he made everyone laugh and that was his main thing in life. He loved to make people happy.\n\n'We're absolutely heartbroken and devastated but I can't change it so I'm just trying to make sure that I do the right thing for the kids.'\n\nMs Tyrrell and her daughters have moved out of the rental to stay with her parents in Pakenham after the ordeal.\n\nFriends have organised a GoFundMe page, which has already raised $38,842, to help financially support the grieving family.\n\nThey also created an email account for Ms Tyrrell and the girls for people to share words of support and memories of Shaun which will be consolidated into a book.",

      "text": "Aussie rock star brothers share heartbreaking news as their lauded filmmaker father dies: 'He pushed us sons hard'\nUS-born filmmaker Bill Leimbach, who emigrated to Australia 47 years ago, has died.\nHis sons, Louis Leimbach, 35 and Oliver Leimbach, 37, of the Aussie band Lime Cordiale, took to Facebook to announce the sad news on Saturday.\nThe pair did not share any details of their father's passing, including his age, but did confirm that he died on August 5, surrounded by his family.\nBest known for his documentaries, Bill worked on the much-loved Channel Seven series The World Around Us (1979-2000) with famed British natural historian Sir David Attenborough.\nHe was also a producer who made the highly acclaimed Australian war drama Beneath Hill 60 starring Brendan Cowell (Love My Way) in 2010.\nBorn in San Diego, California, Bill was a surfer in his youth, and later trained as a filmmaker in London, and entered the film industry there in the 1970s.\nUS-born filmmaker Bill Leimbach (pictured), who emigrated to Australia 47 years ago, has died\nHis sons, Louis Leimbach, 35 and Oliver Leimbach, 37, of the Aussie band Lime Cordiale, took to Facebook to announce the sad news on Saturday. Pictured: Oliver and his brother Louis Leimbach in 2021\nHe worked for the BBC and the British Film Institute, where he met visiting Australian filmmakers like Peter Weir (The Last Wave), Bruce Beresford (Breaker Morant) and Phil Noyce (Dead Calm).\nDeciding he 'loved' Australians and impressed by the new films being made Down Under in the 1970s like Picnic at Hanging Rock, Bill moved to Sydney in 1978.\nBill also won acclaim for his camera work on the French-produced Oscar-nominated documentary Raoni (1978).\nHis first major film was a documentary about Indigenous film star David Gulpilil, Walkabout to Hollywood (1980).\nHe later made the popular travel series Outback Adventures (1998-1999) and the acclaimed history documentary, Gallipoli: The Unknown Stories (2005).\nIn a career spanning over five decades, Bill also made films for National Geographic, PBS, SBS, the ABC and the BBC.\nHe also worked for the Nine, Seven and Channel 10 networks.\n'Not many people can say they had a dad like Bill,' his sons shared on their father's own Facebook page.\nBest known for his documentaries, Bill worked on the much-loved Channel Seven series The World Around Us (1979-2000) with famed British natural historian Sir David Attenborough\nHis first major film was a documentary about Indigenous film star David Gulpilil, Walkabout to Hollywood (1980). Pictured: Bill pictured with Gulpilil\n'He was a filmmaker, a grandpa, a husband, a Yank-turned-Aussie, and a huge presence.'\nElsewhere in their tribute, the Leimbach brothers shared little-known family history.\n'By the time the hippie movement was in full swing, Dad was into photography and had started travelling,' they said.\n'When he was conscripted to fight in Vietnam, he fled to South America. Eventually, they caught him - so he faked insanity and was institutionalised. The plan worked, but after they let him out, he left the States for good,' they wrote.\nHis sons also shared intimate details about their relationship with their father.\n'He pushed us sons hard - but almost in the same breath, he'd tell us to take a f***ing break,' they said.\n'He knew how to turn a holiday into a tax deduction.\n'Dad never grew up. He was a cheeky bugger with an infectious giggle, always trying to shock you with something inappropriate. It's a lesson for all of us. Be carefree and don't take life too seriously because one day you'll be dead.\n'You'd hardly ever see Dad without our merch on.\n'He was our best mate, and we were always trying to impress him. We'll miss you, Dad.'\nThey concluded: 'Written by his sons, but sending love from the whole family.'\nBill shares two daughters, Carli and Tania, with his first wife.\nAfter separating, he met his second wife, Karen, a music teacher, with whom he shares sons Oliver and Louis, who formed Lime Cordiale in 2009."

Ash has just lost the love of her life, best friend and soul mate but in all that is going on currently, she is an incredible mum who is putting everything she has into her girls, which in turn, means she is unable to work at this point in time understandably whilst they all grieve the loss of Shaun and try find their feet again.\nShaun was a great husband, father, son, brother, son-in-law, brother-in-law, uncle, friend and colleague. He will be remembered for his love of food, big smile, cheeky grin, jester mannerisms and an all-round amazing man that he was!\nPlease help us!\nWe are asking if you are able to help us financially support Ash and the girls through this difficult, traumatic time, we would be extremely thankful and eternally grateful for every dollar we can raise to help ease the burden.\nRemembering Shaun and how you can help us.\nWe have created an email account for Ash and the girls. If you have any words for them of support, memories, stories, all things Shaun and who he was, anything at all - even if its a letter for Shaun - we would love and appreciate if you could email them through so that in time, we can consolidate them in into a book for the girls to have forever and remember him by.\nIt will not allow us to add the email direct but it is\ninmemoryofshaunskinnerATgmail.com (Please change the AT to @ symbol).\nThe Skinner and Tyrrell Families combined are extremely thankful for everyone for your love and support throughout this difficult time.\nThank you"
