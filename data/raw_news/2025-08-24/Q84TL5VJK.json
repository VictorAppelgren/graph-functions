  "title": "TV tonight: Piper Alpha revisited \u2013 the world\u2019s deadliest offshore oil disaster",
  "description": "A three-part investigation into the explosion that killed 167 men in 1988. Plus: the return of Stacey Dooley Sleeps Over. Here\u2019s what to watch this evening",
  "content": "In July 1988, 167 men died after a series of explosions tore apart the Piper Alpha oil platform off the coast of Aberdeen \u2013 it was the world\u2019s deadliest offshore oil disaster. This three-part documentary details what happened and uses actors to deliver the testimonies given during the public inquiry. It also speaks to survivors and family members of victims as they still search for answers. The story starts with industrial decline and mass unemployment in 70s Britain. Hollie Richardson\n\nFake Or Fortune: What Happened Next?\n\nIt\u2019s the final episode of this series which revisits investigations into the provenance of paintings. It looks at a picture by Canadian impressionist Helen McNicoll, whose previous appearance led to a former owner coming forward. But did it end up being sold at auction? Alexi Duggins\n\nAfter a public military tattoo called Something About a Soldier was held in Princes Street Gardens in the Scottish capital in 1949, the first official tattoo took place the following year. As the event celebrates its 75th anniversary, the city is marking its 900th anniversary \u2013 so expect an even bigger showcase than usual. HR\n\nJamie Oliver\u2019s new series is all about finding convenient ways to cook healthy meals. In place of the demon Turkey Twizzlers, he is serving up a tasty chicken dish paired unexpectedly with blueberries. And, if salad\u2019s more your speed, he also has an Insta-friendly recipe as colourful as it is nutrient-rich. Ellen E Jones\n\nAmol Rajan oversees a clash between Cambridge\u2019s Trinity College and Oxford\u2019s Linacre College as the first-round heats of the brainy battle royale continue. Trinity has been overall champion three times \u2013 most recently in 2014 \u2013 so its squad may be feeling the pressure to rack up a good enough score to advance. Graeme Virtue\n\nThe recent Bonnie Blue documentary failed to get inside the mind of a woman whose business model includes having sex with more than 1,000 men in a day. But Stacey Dooley is the exact person to sensitively interview Lily Phillips who, similarly to Blue, makes tabloid headlines with OnlyFans content and having sex with 100 men in a day. HR\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola\u2019s Oscar-winning return to the Corleone clan splices two narratives the viewer is invited to compare and contrast. In the present day, Michael struggles to grow his empire in the face of power plays and betrayals; in 1901, his father, Vito, arrives as a boy in New York and rises to criminal prominence. Robert De Niro is convincing as the young adult Vito, making his mark in a lovingly recreated Italian expat community, but Al Pacino has the greater impact as his successor \u2013 distant and controlling with his family but haunted by his choices.
