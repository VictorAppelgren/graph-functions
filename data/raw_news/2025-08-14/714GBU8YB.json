  "content": "It is hard to think of someone more qualified to give swim lessons than 23-time Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps.\n\nSo, when Baltimore Ravens cornerback Marlon Humphrey learned some of his teammates did not know how to swim, he posted a video to social media two weeks ago asking for Phelps\u2019 aid. The issue came up because the Ravens recently renovated their athletic performance center, which now includes a recovery pool. But not everyone on the team was able to take advantage of the perk\u2014as Humphrey and his teammates quickly realized.\n\nIn the video, Humphrey and his teammates Ronnie Stanley, Kyle Hamilton, and Charlie Kolar said \u201cMr. Phelps, we have a problem. Did you know that one in three Ravens cannot swim? We have a solution for you, sir. Come to Ravens training camp and this beautiful aquatic center and teach us how to swim.\u201d\n\nPhelps, who is from Baltimore, Maryland and self-identifies as \u201cthe biggest Ravens fan on the planet,\u201d commented on Instagram \u201cI got yall!!! Let\u2019s do it!!\u201d\n\nPhelps, 40, made good on his promise. On Tuesday, August 12, Phelps visited the Ravens\u2019 during training camp practice and took a tour of the new pool. He gave the team a post-practice motivational speech alongside Ravens legend Ray Lewis.\n\nThen, it was time to go for a swim.\n\nThe group headed to Loyola University\u2019s aquatic center, where they were joined by one of Phelps\u2019 sons, Beckett, along with children from the Boys & Girls Club of Metropolitan Baltimore learning to swim. Members of the Michael Phelps Foundation were also on deck to help, including the Olympic legend\u2019s first swim teacher, Cathy Bennett. Bennett works as a program manager for the Michael Phelps Foundation, which provides families resources to become more comfortable in the water.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was getting into,\u201d Phelps said. \u201cI had no idea what their comfort level was. When I see the guys in there and some of the guys who are literally working on floating and breathing, and they\u2019re focused on paying attention to those details, it shows their vulnerability, especially when they\u2019re uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nCalling in Bennett\u2014or as Phelps calls her, Miss Cathy\u2014allowed Phelps to meet the players\u2019 vulnerability, as he recalled that when he was learning to swim, he was scared to put his face in the water. But as he grew more confident in the water, he was able to take the next step from swimming on his back and put his face in the water.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that everybody is brave enough to give it a try,\u201d Miss Cathy told the players, encouraging them to go for a swim no matter their experience level. Phelps echoed this message, encouraging players to begin with \u201cbaby steps\u201d as they began their journeys in the water.\n\nDrowning is the leading cause of death among children ages one to four in the United States and over half of all American adults have never taken a swimming lesson, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The organization\u2019s data showed that drowning rates are rising too, with already at-risk groups like young children and seniors of all races and ethnicities, as well as Black people of all ages, seeing the greatest increase in deaths.\n\nRising drowning rates underline the importance of everyone learning the life-saving skill, no matter their age. It\u2019s why Stanley participated in the initial Instagram video. \u201cWe want our teammates to be able to have that skill,\u201d Stanley told TODAY during the swim lesson. \u201cAnd, you know, maybe it\u2019ll save someone\u2019s life one day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the type of swimmer that if I have to swim less than 20 yards, I could survive somehow because I could doggy paddle,\u201d linebacker Roquan Smith said in the team\u2019s press release about the event. \u201cBut as far as actually swimming and knowing how to breathe and things of that nature, honestly, it was my first time. It was really cool. It was really solid, some of the lessons they gave me. I feel a little more confident.\u201d\n\nEven Ravens players like Stanley who already knew how to swim got assistance from Phelps. Many of them even took him on in races from the blocks, with Phelps often giving the Ravens players a significant head start before diving in.\n\n\u201cThis was an amazing day,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the greatest athlete of all time. To be able to share the water with him and actually swim laps against him and get coaching points after swimming against him, it was very surreal. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever felt that way, to be honest.\u201d\n\nAs a gesture of appreciation for Phelps, the Ravens made a $100,000 donation to his foundation, which will in turn help more people gain confidence in the water.\n\n\u201cIt was a special day,\u201d said Phelps. \u201cRacing some of the fellas in the 25 [meter]. My son raced some of the guys. It was a great day. I truly hope they learned something, hopefully got some confidence.\u201d",

      "text": "When Michael Phelps heard the call to help the Ravens swim, he sprang from the starting block like he was right back in the Olympics.\n\"I seriously had not seen him that excited for a long, long time,\" said Cathy Bennett, the program manager of the Michael Phelps Foundation.\nAfter cornerback Marlon Humphrey and teammates asked Phelps to teach players to swim on July 29 in a viral social media post, the gears went into motion, figuring out how to pull it off. Two weeks later, the most decorated Olympian of all time and huge Ravens fan came home to Baltimore on a mission.\nPhelps took a tour of the Ravens' new recovery pool at the Under Armour Performance Center and watched training camp practice. After practice, the 23-time gold medalist and fellow Ravens legend (and good friend) Ray Lewis gave the team a motivational speech about what it takes to win in the biggest moments.\nBut the main reason for Phelps' visit was to get in the pool with the Ravens. Humphrey started it all after he noticed one day that one of his teammates wasn't fully enjoying the training facility's new pool.\n\"He goes, 'I'm from New York. I don't need to know how to swim. But if Michael comes, I'll learn,'\" Humphrey said, relaying the origin of his call for help to Phelps.\nThat got the inquisitive and outgoing Humphrey asking around, trying to figure out how widespread this was. He, Kyle Hamilton, Ronnie Stanley, and Charlie Kolar found that about one-third of the team doesn't know how to swim and filmed the message calling for Phelps' help.\nSo, after Tuesday's practice, the team loaded onto buses and departed for Loyola College's aquatic center. While not every player jumped in, the vast majority of Ravens players traded in their jerseys for swim trunks and goggles. Humphrey tried his best to coax the stragglers into the pool.\nA chunk of the team went for the diving boards for a competition that seemed less about form and more about splash power. Tyler Linderbaum had the highlight with a high-dive back flop that sent his teammates into hysterics.\nThe competitive side of the players took over, and they raced each other and Phelps. Hamilton, long snapper Nick Moore and punter Jordan Stout were some of the Ravens' fastest swimmers but they all were blown away by Phelps until he started giving them massive head starts. Phelps brought along his son, Beckett, who also raced some Ravens.\nAnother group of Ravens remained in the shallow end, where they received lessons from Phelps and members of the Michael Phelps Foundation, which provides families with the tools and support to be more confident and comfortable in the water and in life. They were joined by kids from the Boyes & Girls Club of Metropolitan Baltimore, which also brought along kids trying to learn to swim.\nPhelps tried to teach 341-pound defensive tackle Travis Jones how to kick more gracefully with the assistance of a pool noodle. Phelps fetched kickboards so other Ravens players could practice their form.\nLinebacker Roquan Smith, who grew up in rural Georgia, was one of the Ravens' most engaged learners throughout the entire session, showing that it's never too late to learn how to swim.\n\"If I have to swim less than 20 yards, I could survive somehow because I could doggy paddle,\" Smith said. \"But as far as actually swimming and knowing how to breathe and things of that nature, honestly, it was my first time. It was really cool. It was really solid, some of the lessons they gave me. I feel a little more confident.\"\nStanley knew how to swim, but said Phelps gave him pointers on keeping his shoulders tight during his stroke, like he's swimming in an MRI machine.\n\"This was an amazing day,\" Stanley said. \"I think that's the greatest athlete of all time. To be able to share the water with him and actually swim laps against him and get coaching points after swimming against him, it was very surreal. I don't know that I've ever felt that way, to be honest.\"\nFor Phelps, it was a chance to further his mission and spread the word about the importance of learning to swim while being with his favorite team. He called himself \"the biggest Ravens fan on the planet,\" but on Tuesday, he got a chance to give back and the Ravens reciprocated, making a $100,000 donation to his foundation.\nBefore they jumped in the water, he told the players that when he started swimming as a kid, he didn't like putting his face in the water. His teacher started him with the backstroke and eventually he overcame his fear, flipped over, and became the most decorated swimmer of all time.\n\"I didn't know what I was getting into. I had no idea what their comfort level was,\" Phelps said. \"When I see the guys in there and some of the guys who are literally working on floating and breathing, and they're focused on paying attention to those details, it shows their vulnerability, especially when they're uncomfortable.\n\"It was a special day. Racing some of the fellas in the 25 [meter]. My son raced some of the guys. It was a great day. I truly hope they learned something, hopefully got some confidence, and hopefully can transition into something else.\""

      "text": "Identifying issues that increase drowning risk\nIdentifying why drowning has increased and why some groups of people or communities are at higher risk requires better data. We need to understand how to make basic swimming and water safety skills training more accessible. Reported barriers include:\n- Swimming lessons too expensive or not accessible.\n- Fear of water.\n- Pool setting or training not welcoming.\n- Feeling uncomfortable wearing traditional swimwear.\nMany more barriers exist, and some are complex and not well understood. We can develop and carry out inclusive programs that best meet each community\u2019s needs when we understand a community\u2019s unique social and cultural elements. Better data give us that insight.\nHistorical and social factors and the pandemic may be contributing to inequities\nMany Black, American Indian, and Alaska Native people report lack of access to pools as a barrier to swimming lessons. Racial segregation led to few options and many of the available pools were often poorly maintained or too shallow for swimming. Many public pools closed after racial desegregation and communities built fewer new pools over the decades. The legacy of this and other discrimination may influence current generations\u2019 attitudes about and participation in swimming lessons.\nDuring the pandemic, many public pools closed, which limited the availability of swimming lessons. Once pools reopened, many facilities faced shortages of trained swimming instructors and lifeguards. This has further reduced access to swimming lessons.\nOver half of U.S. adults have never taken a swimming lesson\nOnly 28% of Hispanic people and 37% of Black people have taken swimming lessons.\nOver half of U.S. adults have never taken a swimming lesson\nOnly 28% of Hispanic people and 37% of Black people have taken swimming lessons.\nTake steps to reduce drowning risk\nIncreasing access to basic swimming and water safety skills training can reduce the risk of drowning. Here are 5 tips to get started.\nCDC supports young families by working with partners in several ways. These include collecting data to better understand drowning risk and barriers to swimming lessons and working with partners to improve access to effective basic swimming and water safety skills training, especially for people at increased risk of drowning.\nEveryone can\n- Learn how to swim. Take basic swimming and water safety skills training. This is hands-on training that takes place in the water.\n- Make sure children get basic swimming and water safety skills training.\n- Find swimming lessons in your area.\n- Pay close attention to children\u2014even those who have had swimming lessons\u2014whenever they are in or near water, including pools, bathtubs, and even buckets of water.\n- Avoid drinking alcohol before and during swimming and boating, and wear life jackets.\nSee Preventing Drowning for more drowning prevention tips.\nGet email updates about Vital Signs\nVITAL SIGNS RESOURCES"

      "text": "Michael Phelps taught several of the Baltimore Ravens how to swim after the team asked the 28-time Olympic medalist to coach them last month.\nPhelps arrived at the Ravens' training center a couple of weeks after four players asked him for swimming lessons for the team, as just one in three Ravens knows how to swim.\nTODAY got an exclusive look inside the lessons from the 23-time gold medalist \u2014 and lifelong Ravens fan \u2014 starting with a pre-swim pep talk, safely on the shore.\n\"It\u2019s what you do behind closed doors that no one sees that gives you the opportunity to stand out on this field every single week during the season and be great,\" Phelps told the players.\nThe swim lessons all started when cornerback Marlon Humphrey posted a video on Instagram on July 29 with three of his teammates.\n\u201cHey Mr. Phelps, we have a problem,\u201d offensive tackle Ronnie Stanley said in the video, before doing a graceful side-dive into the water, revealing more players behind him.\n\u201cDid you know that one in three Ravens cannot swim?\u201d safety Kyle Hamilton asked.\nMore players asked for Phelps to come to their aquatics center to teach them how to swim, and the Olympian answered the call.\n\u201cI got yall!!! Let\u2019s do it!!\u201d Phelps wrote in a comment on the post.\nOn Tuesday, Aug. 12, the team headed toward the pool, where Phelps told TODAY's Craig Melvin how he planned to teach football players how to swim and be safe in the water.\n\"Start with baby steps. Look like, you know, I know it might sound crazy, but try just blowing bubbles in the water ... become more vulnerable,\" Phelps said.\n\"I think that\u2019s something that a lot of people are afraid of. And instead of being one foot on the boat, one foot on the dock, jump right in. Literally, jump in. Come jump in with me,\" he added.\nPhelps has been a water safety advocate for years, launching the Michael Phelps Foundation in 2008 to help kids and adults learn to swim.\nDrowning is the leading cause of death for children ages one to four, and about 40 million adults in the U.S. don't know how to swim, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nPhelps, a father of four, said he remembers the fear during his first swimming lessons clearly.\n\"When I first got into the water to swim, Miss Cathy was my teacher, and I didn\u2019t want to put my face under,\" he said. \"Yes, me, Michael Phelps, afraid to put my face into the water. But naturally, you overcome those fears based off your confidence and your comfort level in the pool.\"\nPhelps brought the famed Miss Cathy to help teach the Ravens.\n\"I'm hoping that everybody is brave enough to give it a try,\" Miss Cathy told the players.\nPhelps added: \"Let\u2019s get in the water and learn how to swim!\"\nIn addition to the Ravens, 10 children from the Boys & Girls Club were learning how to swim right alongside them.\nStanley said he took part in the video because he thinks swimming is a life skill that everyone should have.\n\"We want our teammates to be able to have that skill,\" Stanley said. \"And, you know, maybe it\u2019ll save someone\u2019s life one day.\"\nAnd after the lessons wrapped, the Ravens had a surprise in store for Phelps.\n\u201cYour foundation does great things on mental health awareness and also water safety. We're going to donate $100,000 to the Michael Phelps Foundation,\u201d said Sashi Brown, president of the Ravens.\nThe Ravens are set to play their first game of the season against the Buffalo Bills at 8:20 p.m. on Sunday, Sept. 7."
