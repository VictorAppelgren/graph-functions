  "description": "Saturday's Week 1 games are complete. But there remains several college football games to be played, delaying the Coaches and AP Top 25 polls.",
  "content": "With several major upsets taking place across college football in the last 24 hours, the college football season is well and truly underway.\n\nThe day began with No. 2 Ohio State likely swapping spots in the top 25 with No. 1 Texas after the defending national champions defeated Arch Manning and the Longhorns for a 14-7 win behind a strong performance from their defense.\n\nThe top 10 took another hit with Tommy Castellanos backing up his offseason comments by helping Florida State roll past No. 8 Alabama for a lopsided 31-17 win. It was the first season opener that Alabama has dropped since the 2001 season.\n\nThe night capped off with the third major upset of the day with Garrett Nussmeier winning the battle against Cade Klubnik to give No. 9 LSU a 17-10 win over No. 6 Clemson in Death Valley, giving LSU its first Week 1 win under Brian Kelly. Elsewhere, Bryce Underwood put on a show in his college debut for No. 14 Michigan in its 34-17 win over New Mexico and No. 20 Kansas State staved off an upset to FCS North Dakota.\n\nBut before one can see how those wins \u2013 and more importantly those losses \u2013 are reflected in the latest top 25 polls, there are still three games to be played on the Labor Day Weekend: Virginia Tech taking on No. 13 South Carolina in the Aflac Kickoff Game in Atlanta; No. 5 Notre Dame visiting No. 10 Miami; and TCU traveling to North Carolina for Bill Belichick's coaching debut in the collegiate ranks.\n\nHere's when both the US LBM Coaches Poll and AP Top 25 poll are released for Week 2 of the college football season:\n\nWhen do college football top 25 polls come out for Week 2?\n\nBoth major college football polls \u2013 the US LBM Coaches Poll and the AP Top 25 poll \u2013 will be released on Tuesday, Sept. 2 ahead of Week 2 of the college football season.\n\nTraditionally, both polls get released every Sunday during the season but with Belichick's UNC Tar Heels taking on TCU on Labor Day in Chapel Hill, the polls have a delayed release for this week. The Coaches Poll will be released between noon ET and 12:30 p.m. ET on the day of its release, with the AP poll following in suit around 2 p.m. ET.",

      "text": "Hype over substance: Ohio State, Texas both have a long way to go after opener\n- Neither Texas quarterback Arch Manning nor Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin played up to the hype surrounding them.\n- Ohio State's defensive coordinator, Matt Patricia, was instrumental in the team's victory over Texas.\n- Both teams have room for improvement over the next three months of the season.\nOK, class, let\u2019s go over what we learned today from that beautiful shrine of a stadium on the banks of the Olentangy.\nPolls are stupid and meaningless. Especially preseason polls.\nVegas doesn\u2019t know everything, it just knows how to set a line to get both sides to wager as much cash as possible. They\u2019re not sharps in those sports books, they\u2019re sharks.\nAnd Arch isn\u2019t Peyton or Eli or even Archie. He\u2019s just a young quarterback trying to find his way.\nJust like Julian Sayin at Ohio State.\nSo while Texas quarterback/Heisman Trophy favorite/first pick in the NFL draft Arch Manning was exposed in the season opener at Ohio State, he wasn\u2019t alone. So were the Buckeyes.\nThat\u2019s right, neither Texas nor Ohio State \u2013 Nos. 1 and 2 in the US LBM coaches poll \u2013 looked the part.\nThen again, neither did Bill Belichick, who thought Matt Patricia could call offensive ball plays in the NFL. Think about that nonsense for a moment.\nPatricia, now the Ohio State defensive coordinator, was the hero in this game. Without him and his game plan to utterly confuse Manning and Texas coach Steve Sarkisian (a real, live offensive play caller), this thing was about as exciting as a Siberian winter.\nIf you think Manning struggled, I\u2019ve got a former five-star, elite recruit from California to sell you. Neither Manning nor Sayin looked like championship quarterbacks, but that doesn\u2019t mean either (or both) can\u2019t develop into one.\nIt just means I would\u2019ve rather watched reruns of the 2020 National Mullet Championship (I swear this is a thing) than one more quarter of Ohio State-Texas. And speaking of mullets, anyone in Austin missing Quinn Ewers?\nThis is what happens when you spend an entire offseason praising a player who barely got his silk jersey stained in two seasons on campus. Or when you think an offense that steamrolled the College Football Playoff in 2024, could reload and do the same with a quarterback who had barely thrown 20 career passes in mop up time.\nWill Howard played five seasons of college football, and threw 1,202 passes. He won a Big 12 championship, for the love of pigskin.\nHe had seen every defensive scheme, every exotic blitz package, every combo coverage any coordinator could possible throw at him. He knew what was coming before the ball was snapped.\nThere\u2019s gigantic value in that. Let me say that again, gigantic.\nYou can\u2019t expect Manning and/or Sayin to walk under center or stand in the shotgun for the first time in a big time moment, and look (and play) like a fifth-year senior. Both threw touchdown passes in the game, and both were 50-50 balls that 99 percent of college quarterbacks can throw.\nDon\u2019t blame them, point your anger at the offseason hype machine. And then marvel at the one guy on the field that wasn\u2019t affected by anything: Patricia.\nNo matter how inexperienced Manning is as a starting quarterback in big-time football, he\u2019s not 17-of-30 bad. He\u2019s not 5.6 yards per attempt bad, not three explosion plays in the pass game bad.\nPatricia played coverage, and the rebuilt defensive line got pressure with four and five rushing. And the next thing you know, it\u2019s like we\u2019re watching Wake Forest and Boston College.\nLet\u2019s be honest, Ohio State should be able to manage a majority of its schedule playing exactly like it did Saturday. Sayin will get better, and he and Jeremiah Smith will find their groove.\nTexas, on the other hand, has some heavy lifting ahead \u2014 against defenses that will be as good or better than Ohio State. And against offenses that won\u2019t struggle to score points.\nA schedule that may even be too much to reach the CFP. Which brings us all the way back to polls.\nNeither of these teams looked the part. But there\u2019s three months to make it right.\nYou don\u2019t have to be a Manning to understand that.\nMatt Hayes is the senior national college football writer for USA TODAY Sports Network.

      "text": "Who has the real Death Valley, Clemson or LSU? What to know for teams' Week 1 game\n- Clemson and LSU football's home stadiums are both nicknamed Death Valley.\n- The Tigers play on Saturday, Aug. 30 in the first game held on either team's campus\n- Here's what to know of both teams' claim to the Death Valley moniker.\nThough LSU and Clemson have only played four times in their programs' histories, the two preseason top-10 teams are two of the preeminent college football brands in the country.\nThe two also have an interesting connection that is shaped by the craze of their fan bases.\nIt's part of what makes the stakes so high for their season opener on Saturday, Aug. 30, under the lights of Clemson's Memorial Stadium: Finally, the teams can settle the long-standing debate of which program has the \"real\" Death Valley, as both teams' home stadiums are nicknamed.\nPrior to their Saturday meeting, none of the Tigers' previous games was held in Clemson, South Carolina, or Baton Rouge, Louisiana. LSU has jumped out to a 3-1 series lead, but all games took place in neutral-site locations.\nWith that, here's what to know about the Death Valley squabble between Clemson and LSU:\nWho has the real Death Valley, Clemson or LSU?\nThe tiff between Clemson and LSU over who has the \"real\" Death Valley has been going on for years, but the debate was refueled by LSU coach Brian Kelly at SEC media days in July, when he joked about LSU allowing Clemson to rent the moniker.\n\"We still think we are the Death Valley,\" Kelly said. \"They can use the name, too. We're letting them borrow it.\"\nHe doubled down on his comments during a local speaking engagement on July 23.\n\"You want great habits when they're needed, when you're on the road and you're playing at 'Death Valley Junior.' Not the Death Valley,\" Kelly said. \"You need those traits on a day-to-day basis.\"\nHere's how Dabo Swinney responded at the podium on ACC media days:\n\"There's always fuel for the fire. You can take whatever you want, everybody's different, and they can be motivated by different things along the way,\" Swinney said (via CBS Sports). \"You know, Michael Jordan used to make stuff up, right? For those of you following Michael Jordan, he would just make stuff up, whether it was true or not, because that was how he motivated himself on some things. But, everybody's different in that regard.\n\"It isn't going to have anything to do with blocking, tackling, and executing on game day. So, it makes it fun, but let's go focus on what we have to do.\"\nIn a separate interview with ESPN at ACC media days, Swinney said there is no debate on who has the real Death Valley.\n\"We don't have to prove that,\" Swinney told ESPN. \"That's a fact. You can Google that.\"\nWhy is Clemson's Memorial Stadium called Death Valley?\nPer Clemson's athletic site, Memorial Stadium is referred to as Death Valley because of former Presbyterian coach Lonnie McMillan.\nThe statement came from McMillan following Clemson's 76-0 rout over Presbyterian in 1945, when he called the Tigers' home stadium \"college football's Death Valley.\" As noted by ESPN, McMillan's usage of the term was a reference to the unpleasantness opponents faced inside, similar to his visit to the Mojave Desert in the summer of 1932.\nMcMillan's statement rang true, as the Tigers outscored the Blue Hose 368-7 in their meetings from 1944 to 1950.\nMemorial Stadium has since gone through renovations, growing to seat more than 80,000 fans over the years. NCAA.com notes that Memorial Stadium is the 13th-largest capacity college football stadium among Division I programs, at 81,500.\nMemorial Stadium has also lived up to its Death Valley moniker under Swinney, particularly from 2016 through 2022. That stretch saw the Tigers win five consecutive ACC championships, two national titles and an ACC-record 40-game home winning streak, tied for the eighth-longest streak in FBS history.\nAnother factor in the Death Valley nickname is Howard's Rock, which sits atop the hill that Clemson famously runs down while entering the stadium. The rock, given to former Clemson coach Frank Howard by Clemson alum Sam Jones from the Mojave Desert, debuted on Sept. 6, 1966.\nA plaque reads, \"From Death Valley, CA to Death Valley, SC.\"\nWhy is LSU Tiger Stadium called Death Valley?\nLSU's Tiger Stadium has a more elaborate origin to its Death Valley nickname.\nAccording to ESPN, the moniker dates back to 1960, when former LSU wrestler Thurman \"Crowe\" Peele opened up a Baton Rouge gas station located within \"shouting distance\" of Tiger Stadium. The legend then goes that Peele coined Tiger Stadium as \"Deaf Valley,\" since the walls in his service station would shake from the LSU home game crowds.\nSo, if it was called \"Deaf Valley\" by Peele, how did it become Death Valley? To get that answer, one will have to go back to the 1959 Sugar Bowl.\nLSU defeated Clemson 7-0 for the national championship thanks to Mickey Mangham 9-yard touchdown reception on third down. This immediately got LSU fans to begin claiming \"death,\" since they defeated the team whose home resides in Death Valley.\nBut the nickname didn't stick for LSU until the infamous Earthquake Game on Oct. 8, 1988, when LSU upset No. 4 Auburn 7-6. The loud atmosphere inside Tiger Stadium \"triggered a seismograph in a geoscience lab 1,000 feet away from the stadium.\"\nClemson football home record\nAccording to Clemson's record book, the Tigers enter the 2025 season with a 345-106-7 (.761) all-time record in games played at Memorial Stadium since it opened up in 1952.\nSince Swinney took over the program ahead of the 2008 season, Clemson has gone 99-12 inside Memorial Stadium.\nLSU football home record\nAccording to LSU's record book, the Tigers enter the 2025 season with a 457-151-18 (.744) all-time record in games played at Tiger Stadium since it opened in 1924. LSU is 147-24 at Tiger Stadium since 2000, and is 360-111-3 all-time in games played at night inside Tiger Stadium.\nSince Kelly was hired as the successor to Ed Orgeron ahead of the 2022 season, LSU has gone 19-2 inside Tiger Stadium. The Tigers went a perfect 7-0 at home in Kelly's second season in Baton Rouge in 2023, which included SEC wins over Florida, Texas A&M, Auburn and Arkansas."

      "text": "LSU's defeat of Clemson might have saved Tigers, SEC with College Football Playoff\n- The win is significant for the SEC after losses by Alabama and Texas to non-conference opponents.\n- LSU's defense, a previous weakness under coach Brian Kelly, appears to be much improved.\n- The victory establishes LSU as a potential national championship contender.\nCLEMSON, SC \u2014 Weeks from now, while we\u2019re deep into a crazy ride of a college football season, we\u2019ll look back and marvel at how LSU saved the SEC season out of the gate.\nAnd set itself up for a national championship run.\n\"These are big wins, there's no doubt,\" LSU coach Brian Kelly said after a 17-10 victory over No. 6 Clemson.\nHe had no idea how big before it all unfolded.\nBecause while LSU was grinding out a top five win on the road, No. 1 Texas and SEC king Alabama were trying to understand how it all went wrong. When told of the Texas loss to Ohio State, and Florida State's win over Alabama, LSU linebacker Whit Weeks said, \"Really? Wow.\"\nHe picked up his bag to headed for the bus after a critical win, and turned and said, \"Wait, how bad did Alabama lose again?\"\nBad, really bad.\nThat's what makes this LSU win so important to a conference desperate to regain its footing in a quickly shifting environment on the field. The Big Ten has won the last two national championships, and each time the SEC hasn't even made the final.\nThen there's LSU, which hadn't won a season opener in Kelly's first three seasons, and hadn't won on the opening week of the season overall since 2019 \u2015 when a guy named Burrow was throwing darts all over the place. So yeah, this was big.\nKelly told anyone who would listen this offseason that this was his best LSU team. What he didn\u2019t say was this team had characteristics unlike any he has had in Baton Rouge.\nTough. Smart. Resilient.\nIn one gut-check of a game, LSU distanced itself from Kelly\u2019s three previous teams with undeniable grit and fortitude. And the Tigers did it with defense.\nThat\u2019s right, defense.\nThe one thing that has kept LSU from reaching its potential under Kelly now looks like the one thing that could make this team so dangerous this fall.\n\"We want the game in our hands,\" said LSU defensive coordinator Blake Baker.\nThis from a defense that two years ago wasted a Heisman Trophy season from quarterback Jayden Daniels, and last year had one of the worst statistical defenses in program history. It took all of 60 minutes on the field to change that tune.\nClemson and its high-powered offense had 261 total yards, including a lousy 31 rushing yards on 20 carries. By the time it was over, by the time a fourth-down throw was deflected by blitzing linebacker Harold Perkins Jr. (remember him?), LSU had held Clemson to just nine minutes of clock time in the second half.\nNo matter the circumstances, the LSU defense kept coming. The offense fumbled at the negative 24 on the second drive of the game, and the defense forced a field goal. The offense then fumbled again at the end of the half, this time on a fourth and two from the Clemson 12.\nAll Kelly did was look up at the scoreboard as the teams ran off the field, glaring at the reality staring back at him from the scoreboard: Clemson coach Dabo Swinney's teams were 115-11 when leading at halftime.\n\"I told our guys, well, it's going to have to be 115-12,\" Kelly said. \"Because there was no other choice.\"\nJust like there was no other choice for the defense with Clemson driving late in the game. Kelly put the defense through the identical two-minute situation numerous times during fall camp, forcing them to figure ways of making stops.\nThis defense \u2013 rebuilt through critical additions from the transfer portal \u2013 then went out and saved a critical season opener. And maybe the SEC's reputation. For a day, at least.\nBecause after Florida State humiliated Alabama, and Ohio State exposed Texas and hyped quarterback Arch Manning, there wasn\u2019t much left for the big, bad SEC on opening weekend.\nThe conference that holds itself above all others was in danger of three losses in marquee non-conference games, and a bunch of wins against nobodies. By nobodies, I mean one opponent\u2019s mascot was actually \u201cSharks.\u201d\nAnd no, Adam Sandler was nowhere to produce the carnage.\nBut LSU did show up in a big game, a line in the sand game where it had to clearly declare where it was headed under Kelly. A team that reaches almost there with a useless bowl win, or a program that rolls into big games and squeezes the life out of them.\nSo it should come as no surprise that the unit Kelly worked on more than any this offseason, was the group that saved the day.\nBy the time Clemson\u2019s high-powered offense took the field with 1:46 to play, it had barely reached 200 yards of offense. The final drive ended when Perkins Jr. forced an errant throw at the LSU 15.\nIt was one of many forced errors by the defense, and specifically, the pass rush. That, everyone, is what big boy football is at its core.\nIt\u2019s a game of will and want.\nFootball is finding your inner fortitude, and backing up words with action. It\u2019s not running your mouth for social media likes or viral moments \u2015 and then folding in crunch time.\nEarlier this summer, Florida State quarterback Tommy Castellanos did just that when he said Nick Saban wasn\u2019t around anymore at Alabama. So Tide star linebacker Deonte Lawson responded at SEC Media Days, on the biggest stage of the offseason, by declaring, \u201call disrespect will be addressed accordingly.\u201d\nThe only \u201caddressing\u201d in the SEC came from LSU in front of a raucous and wild stadium in the Lowcountry, one that was juiced for this thing for months. LSU took big blows from Clemson on both sides of the ball early on, but kept grinding, kept figuring ways to stay close until it figured out the Clemson defense in the second half.\nBecause the one thing that Kelly made sure wouldn\u2019t let him down again kept punching back.\nImpact players from the transfer portal (including edges Jack Pyburn and Patrick Payton, and defensive backs Mansoor Delane and Tamarcus Cooley) have changed the way LSU plays defense. So has the return of Perkins Jr., to his freshman form.\nAll it took was the LSU offense, the one staple under Kelly that hasn\u2019t wavered in three seasons, to figure out Clemson\u2019s defense. Once quarterback Garrett Nussmeier, who finished with 230 yards passing, started making big throws, even an obviously blown call that negated a touchdown pass wasn\u2019t enough to stop this train.\n\"This was a momentum builder, a confidence booster,\" Nussmeier said.\nFor LSU, and the suddenly shaky SEC.\nFor a week, at least.\nMatt Hayes is the senior national college football writer for USA TODAY Sports Network.

      "text": "Alabama's flop leads college football Week 1 winners and losers\n- Alabama lost to Florida State 31-17 in their season opener, their first opening-game loss since 2001.\n- Tulane emerged as a potential Group of Five playoff contender after defeating Northwestern.\n- Tennessee showcased a strong offense in their win against Syracuse.\nFifteen years of unparalleled dominance gone and erased \u2013 poof! \u2013 in the span of a season and one game.\nNick Saban isn\u2019t walking through that door. Heck, AJ McCarron isn\u2019t, either. There is no rationale reason for optimism.\nAfter losing to Vanderbilt and Oklahoma in coach Kalen DeBoer\u2019s debut, the No. 8 Crimson Tide opened 2025 with an embarrassing 31-17 loss at unranked Florida State, which ended last season at or near the very bottom of the Power Four. The loss was Alabama\u2019s first in a season opener since 2001.\nThere is nothing Alabama does particularly well and some obvious flaws, including the play of an offense that averaged just 4.6 yards per play. From drops to missed blocks to missed assignments, Alabama\u2019s offense managed to combine poor preparation with poor execution. Defensively, the Tide allowed 6.1 yards per play and 10.9 yards per pass attempt.\nThis is what Alabama resembles a game into DeBoer\u2019s second year: an average program farther away from the national championship than at any single point during the Saban era.\nAnd given what\u2019s unfolded since a win against Georgia last September, it\u2019s become incredibly hard to see how DeBoer\u2019s tenure gets back on track.\nThat makes the Tide the biggest losers of the first Saturday of the 2025 season. Coming in second is No. 1 Texas, which lost 14-7 at No. 2 Ohio State in one of the most hyped season openers in recent history:\nWinners\nOhio State\nThe win against Texas will reinsert the defending national champions atop the US LBM Coaches Poll as the Longhorns tumble down the rankings. But that\u2019s just the beginning. It\u2019s difficult to overstate the long-term impact the result of Saturday\u2019s season opener will have on both teams along with the Big Ten and SEC, especially in how the selection committee eventually assesses the Buckeyes, Longhorns and these two conferences.\nPlaying with a reworked roster and coaching staff, the Buckeyes squeezed just enough from an unimposing offense to score the type of victory that will linger deep into the regular season and beyond. While games against Penn State and Michigan will determine the Big Ten, the odds of Ohio State making the playoff in some capacity have increased dramatically.\nThere\u2019s plenty of improvement needed on the offensive end after the Buckeyes gained just 203 yards on 3.8 yards per play, including only 2.3 yards per carry. Before Saturday, the Buckeyes\u2019 fewest yards in a regular-season game since 2016 was 252 yards in last year\u2019s loss to Michigan. By default, Julian Sayin outplayed Manning by avoiding turnovers and focusing his attention on star wide receiver Jeremiah Smith, who had a game-high six receptions.\nBut this was to be expected: OSU was overhauling things on offense behind new personnel and a new offensive coordinator. That there are similar changes underway on defense speaks to the ability of that unit to keep the Buckeyes at or near the top of the FBS while the offense rounds into form. The defending national champions passed a high-profile test to open the year and should only get better from here.\nLSU\nNo. 9 LSU forced Cade Klubnik into a late incompletion on fourth down and with No. 4 Clemson in the red zone to win 17-10 in the other Death Valley and reclaim a huge chunk of the momentum lost during a disappointing 2024 season. Beyond flipping the script given the program\u2019s winless mark in season openers under Brian Kelly, this one puts LSU back on the map as a legitimate contender for the SEC crown and national championship. The defense stepped up: Clemson managed just 261 yards of offense and only 1.6 yards per carry. While that performance will reignite criticism of Clemson\u2019s offense, the story coming out of Saturday is about the growth seen from LSU after multiple years in a row of dismal defensive numbers.\nFlorida State\nWe won\u2019t know for a bit whether beating Alabama actually means anything when it comes to the Seminoles\u2019 chances of a worst-to-first climb in the ACC. But from a symbolic perspective, it\u2019s hard to top the deep meaning behind a win against the Crimson Tide. At a minimum, the victory speaks to the way Mike Norvell remade the program in the offseason, especially in hiring new coordinators Gus Malzahn and Tony White. Another big addition was former Boston College quarterback Thomas Castellanos who was dead-on accurate when he said in June that Alabama didn\u2019t \u201chave Nick Saban to save them\u201d anymore.\nTulane\nTulane is the current favorite for the Group of Five\u2019s bid to the playoff after Boise State\u2019s stunning loss at South Florida on Friday night and the Green Wave\u2019s 23-3 win against Northwestern. Brigham Young quarterback transfer Jake Retzlaff threw for 152 yards and ran for a game-high 113 yards with two touchdowns. The Wildcats are one of three Power Four teams in non-conference play for Tulane, joining Duke and No. 15 Mississippi. Splitting games against the Blue Devils and Rebels while losing just once in American play should leave Tulane atop the Group of Five in December.\nTennessee\nThe No. 18 Volunteers suffered no post-Nico Iamaleava hangover by beating Syracuse 45-26 in Atlanta behind 281 yards of total offense and three scores from new starting quarterback Joey Aguilar. The Appalachian State and UCLA transfer paced a balanced offense that threw for 247 yards and ran for 246 yards and two touchdowns on 6.2 yards per carry. Based on Saturday, the Volunteers have to be taken seriously as an SEC contender.\nJohn Mateer\nOklahoma\u2019s new quarterback looked the part of an impact transfer by completing 30 of 37 throws for 392 yards with four touchdowns as the Sooners beat Illinois State 35-3. The 392 yards set a new program record for a debut. While beating the Redbirds tells us nothing about the Sooners\u2019 chances in the SEC or against Michigan next week, it\u2019s clear that grabbing Mateer and coordinator Ben Arbuckle away from Washington State is going to have a hugely positive impact on this offense.\nLosers\nTexas\nThe Longhorns will spend the rest of the regular season trying to make up ground against a schedule that includes No. 4 Georgia, No. 17 Florida, No. 21 Texas A&M and Oklahoma. While we only have one year of data at our disposal, Texas could conceivably lose twice in the SEC and still be in position for an at-large playoff bid. But the issues run deeper for the Longhorns, and include early questions about Manning, the overall state of the offense and whether there is enough experienced talent to play with and beat the best teams in the FBS. Bellyflopping into the regular season after months of acclaim as the SEC favorite, Texas never resembled the team many expected to go wire to wire atop the Coaches Poll.\nArch Manning\nNo player reflects this disappointment more than Manning, who went 17 of 30 for 170 yards, averaging an anemic 5.7 yards per throw, with a touchdown and an interception to go with another 38 rushing yards. (There might not have been more commercials featuring Manning during the Fox broadcast than completions against the OSU defense from Manning, but it was close.) His struggles were underscored by the fact 98 of his passing yards came in the final five minutes after Texas trailed by 14. This is essentially a nightmare scenario for the youngest member of the quarterback dynasty: Texas lost while Manning was very unimpressive, and the talking-head coverage of the Longhorns and their quarterback this week will be absolutely brutal.\nKalen DeBoer\nHe\u2019ll shoulder the blame for Alabama\u2019s latest failure, as he should. The next few months will determine whether DeBoer returns in 2026, though you\u2019d have to think he\u2019d get at least one more year unless the Tide completely disintegrate in SEC play. More than a result of evaluation, development or game-day preparation, DeBoer\u2019s current predicament can be linked to a fateful choice: to replace the greatest coach in program history and inherit Saban-era expectations. It\u2019s always better to replace the guy who replaces the guy, you know.\nCade Klubnik\nClemson\u2019s road to the playoff still goes through teams such as Miami, SMU and the rest of the ACC\u2019s upper crust. In the end, the LSU loss does much more to Clemson\u2019s reputation and level of national respect than to the Tigers\u2019 overall playoff odds. (That respect level just took a big hit, by the way.) There\u2019s going to be a more concrete impact on Klubnik, who began the year as one of the co-leaders for the Heisman Trophy but will have a hard time moving past a mediocre game in the loss. The senior hit on 19 of 38 throws for 230 yards and an interception.\nKansas State\nAfter dropping the Week 0 opener to No. 21 Iowa State in Dublin, No. 20 Kansas State struggled to put away North Dakota of the Championship Subdivision before scoring with 42 seconds left to win 38-35. This one featured a better game from quarterback Avery Johnson, who had 318 passing yards and three scores, but narrowly getting past an FCS opponent doesn\u2019t help rebuild the Wildcats\u2019 diminishing credibility with Big 12 play around the corner."

      "text": "Should Alabama football be ranked? Not after what Florida State just did\n- Alabama had no Nick Saban to save it, no ferocity and none of that \"hard edge\" \u2013 whatever that means \u2013 that we heard about in the preseason.\n- Alabama's fearsome defense is nothing but a memory.\n- Thomas Castellanos can talk all the trash he wants after backing up comments about Alabama.\nThomas Castellanos stands 5 feet, 11 inches tall, but he\u2019s planted atop a mile of moxie. From that perch, the Florida State quarterback boldly boasted this summer that the Alabama Crimson Tide don\u2019t have Nick Saban to \"save them\" anymore, and that Alabama\u2019s defense didn\u2019t stand a chance of stopping him.\nHe told no lies. In fact, he might have undersold it.\nAlabama had no Saban, no ferocity and none of that \"hard edge\" \u2013 whatever that means \u2013 that we heard about in the preseason.\nCastellanos and his companions made minced meat of a defense Saban once made the most feared in the land.\nI thought Castellanos had been wrong to poke the bear, but I was wrong. The bear doesn\u2019t reside in Tuscaloosa anymore. What\u2019s left is a 31-17 loser to Florida State.\n\"There's no excuse about what happened,\" Alabama coach Kalen DeBoer said.\nTruly, there isn\u2019t any excusing this. Under DeBoer, Alabama has become a team you can talk trash to and get away with it.\nI\u2019m not prepared to author the eulogy to DeBoer\u2019s Alabama coaching tenure, but there\u2019s no polishing his first 14 games as Saban\u2019s heir, either.\nThe backslide in Alabama's defense that started at the end of the Saban era slipped into freefall in this season opener.\nSaban said on \"College GameDay\" a few hours before kickoff that he sensed \"a different culture\" within Alabama\u2019s team after last year\u2019s disappointing debut under DeBoer. His praise turned out to be fluff from a TV bobblehead.\nCastellanos is right: This isn\u2019t a fearsome Alabama defense of the Saban heyday \u2013 certainly not at the line of scrimmage.\nI could underscore that DeBoer lost to a team that won two games last year, less than 11 months after he lost to Vanderbilt. But, FSU\u2019s 2024 record isn\u2019t particularly relevant. The Seminoles live and die by the transfer portal. Two years ago, they struck it big. Last year, they whiffed. Part of the miss came in choosing DJ Uiagalelei as quarterback.\nCastellanos corrected that problem. The Boston College transfer led the team in rushing, and he made his nine completions count.\nNew Florida State offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn reprised his role as the boogeyman who spooks 'Bama.\nYou need more evidence that the Alabama brutality present at the peak of Saban\u2019s prime is long gone? There\u2019s this: Florida State outrushed Alabama 230 to 74, and the Seminoles had more than twice as many tackles for loss.\nThere was a theory around Alabama throughout the offseason that the team could improve without new starting quarterback Ty Simpson being a superstar in the mold of Bryce Young or Tua Tagovailoa.\nMake good decisions, avoid mistakes, put the ball on the money more times than not, and let the supporting cast take care of the rest.\nThat logic hinges on Simpson enjoying an excellent supporting cast.\nWe got a look at his supporting cast in Tallahassee. Florida State\u2019s is better. So is its quarterback.\nThere\u2019s no bear left to fear at Alabama. Just some cuddly defense that couldn\u2019t stop a 5-foot-11 transfer quarterback from Boston College.\nHere\u2019s what else I\u2019m eyeing after the season's first full Saturday:\nACC pecking order needs to be reworked?\nSo, is Florida State the ACC favorite, after its upset victory and after Clemson failed to muster a punch in a 17-10 loss to LSU? Let\u2019s hold off on that judgment until we see No. 10 Miami play No. 5 Notre Dame.\nIf you picked unranked Florida State as your playoff sleeper, you\u2019re looking mighty wise about now, but the schedule houses more landmines. The Seminoles will host Miami, play at Clemson and play at Florida.\nAt the very least, it\u2019s a three-horse race in the ACC.\nNay, a four-horse race, because I'll add Louisville to the mix of Florida State, Clemson and Miami. I'd consider SMU, too, except I can't unsee what happened at Penn State eight months ago.\nJulian Sayin supplies 'smart' first start\nTexas linebacker Anthony Hill Jr. aptly described Ohio State quarterback Julian Sayin\u2019s first career start thusly: \"He played smart.\"\nCan't argue that. The redshirt freshman didn\u2019t dazzle but also didn\u2019t destruct while executing a conservative game plan in a 14-7 takedown of No. 1 Texas.\nSayin outdueled Arch Manning. Tell that to the grandkids.\nAs for Archie Manning\u2019s grandkid, he might want to call his uncle. Peyton Manning completed a modest 7 of 14 passes for 79 yards in his first career start, although Tennessee won that game.\nThis wasn\u2019t Arch Manning\u2019s first start \u2013 he started two games last season against hapless competition \u2013 but it marked his first road start. He looked jittery against the defending national champions.\nCoach Steve Sarkisian\u2019s game plan didn\u2019t help, either. Score one for new Buckeyes defensive coordinator Matt Patricia. He outfoxed Sarkisian, and Sayin outplayed Manning.\n\"I just loved his composure,\" Buckeyes coach Ryan Day said in a postgame interview on Fox.\nSpeaking of first career starts \u2026\nBuckeyes fans watching the New Mexico-Michigan game at a bar just outside Columbus erupted when the Lobos scored their first touchdown. After New Mexico\u2019s second touchdown, two Ohio State fans ordered a shot. Enjoy the bourbon, but after sobering up, realize that Michigan\u2019s true freshman Bryce Underwood played beyond his years while smoothly tossing for 251 yards and a touchdown in a 34-17 victory.\nNew Mexico isn\u2019t Texas, but both Sayin and Underwood passed their first tests.\nBrian Kelly quiets critics\nThe sharks were circling, ready to barbecue Brian Kelly with a series of mean tweets and memes if he lost another LSU season opener. Garrett Nussmeier and a retooled LSU defense refused to allow that to happen.\nThe Tigers secured the most impressive Week 1 victory this side of Florida State by unleashing their meaner, smarter, faster defense on Clemson.\nLSU outplayed Clemson more significantly than the score indicates, too.\nNussmeier made some big-league throws, thriving on a day when fellow Heisman Trophy frontrunners Manning and Clemson\u2019s Cade Klubnik struggled.\nThis result doesn\u2019t knock Clemson from the playoff picture. Far from it. Remember what happened after Clemson got trounced by Georgia in last season's opener? Beating a good SEC opponent and winning the ACC are challenges of two different orders.\nBut, this outcome does show Kelly made smart investments in an offseason portal raid that transformed LSU's personnel.\nHoly smokes, Joey Aguilar\nI jokingly texted this to a couple of colleagues on Saturday: Auburn vs. Tennessee in the SEC Championship Game? In seriousness, Auburn and Tennessee were among the SEC\u2019s big winners in Week 1.\nNico Iamaleava did Joey Aguilar a massive favor by transferring to UCLA. Now, Aguilar gets to play for Josh Heupel and Tennessee instead of DeShaun Foster and UCLA. Talk about an upgrade for Aguilar. Perhaps, Tennessee upgraded, too. Aguilar cooked Syracuse in his first game with the Vols.\nHe transferred after UCLA replaced him as starter with Iamaleava. How's that looking, Bruins?\nIamaleava, the five-star in pajama pants, threw for a meager 136 yards in a 43-10 beatdown at the hands of Utah.\nRound 1 of the UCLA-Tennessee quarterback trade goes to Aguilar, and it was a mismatch.\nAnother key transfer in the SEC, Auburn\u2019s Jackson Arnold, helped Hugh Freeze quiet his critics for a week in a pivotal road win at Baylor.\nIf Alabama stays as feeble as it looked against Florida State, then the schedules become easier for Auburn and Tennessee. Maybe, I wasn't joking about that SEC Championship matchup.\nThree and out\n1. My favorite scene from my time on the road in Week 1: I watched Lee Corso eat a couple of hot dogs with a knife and fork in the press box during the first half of the Texas-Ohio State game. Earlier, Corso made his final pick, putting on the Brutus Buckeye head, inside Ohio Stadium before kickoff on his \"College GameDay\" farewell. ESPN\u2019s 90-year-old pregame show personality is retiring, but not before a final press box meal. George Costanza would approve of Corso busting out the utensils on a food item others would eat with their hands.\n2. I'm not a poll voter this season. If I had a ballot, LSU would be ranked no lower than No. 3 in my voting after Week 1, with Ohio State and Penn State joining them on the podium. That LSU defense, a unit that's struggled for years, looked quite salty against Clemson.\n3. Speaking of rankings, try to convince me that Alabama should be ranked after that dud. There\u2019s no evidence for it.\nBlake Toppmeyer is the USA TODAY Network's senior national college football columnist. Email him at BToppmeyer@gannett.com and follow him on X @btoppmeyer."

      "text": "Texas football vs Ohio State highlights: Buckeyes beat Arch Manning, Longhorns\n- Texas and Ohio State faced off in a meeting of the top two teams in college football\n- Julian Sayin and Ohio State outperformed Arch Manning and Texas in the one-score win\nThe top two teams in the US LBM Coaches Poll squared off in the heart of Big Ten country on Saturday for the biggest game of the Week 1 slate in college football.\nAnd while the game didn't live up to the expectations it had going into it, it didn't disappoint.\nThanks to a big-time stop on fourth-and-5 late in the fourth quarter on top of a monstrous day overall by its defense, No. 2 Ohio State pulled out a gutsy 14-7 win over the top-ranked Texas Longhorns and Arch Manning.\nThe first scoring drive of the game took place at the 8:57 mark in the second quarter when West Virginia running back transfer CJ Donaldson broke through Texas\u2019 defensive line to score six for Ohio State.\nOhio State first-year starting quarterback Julian Sayin then extended the Buckeyes\u2019 lead to 14-0 with a 40-yard touchdown pass to Carnell Tate to open up the final frame. Tate led all Buckeye receivers with 49 yards off two catches, while star receiver Jeremiah Smith was held to five receptions and 40 yards on nine targets.\nAfter struggling for three quarters, Texas quarterback Arch Manning found a rhythm late in the fourth quarter when he connected with Parker Livingston for a 32-yard touchdown to give the Longhorns a chance at keeping their No. 1 ranking intact.\nPerhaps the biggest storyline from the game, though, was how Ohio State's defense performed under first-year defensive coordinator Matt Patricia, which came up with an interception and forced four turnovers on downs.\nUSA TODAY Sports provided live updates, scores and highlights from the game. Follow below.\nWatch Ohio State vs. Texas live with Fubo (free trial)\nOhio State vs Texas final score\n| TEAMS | 1Q | 2Q | 3Q | 4Q | F |\n| Texas | 0 | 0 | 0 | 7 | 7 |\n| Ohio State | 0 | 7 | 0 | 7 | 14 |\nOhio State vs Texas highlights\nHere's a compilation of highlights from Ohio State's Aug. 30 win over No. 1 Texas:\nOhio State vs Texas updates\nThis section has been updated with new information\nJulian Sayin stats vs Texas\nHere's a look at Julian Sayin's stats vs. Texas on Saturday:\n- Completions: 13\n- Attempts: 20\n- Percentage: 65%\n- Passing yards: 126\n- Touchdowns: 1\n- Interceptions: 0\n- QB Rating: 134.4\n- Rush attempts: 2\n- Rushing yards: 2\nArch Manning stats vs Texas\nHere's a look at Arch Manning's stats vs. Ohio State on Saturday:\n- Completions: 17\n- Attempts: 30\n- Percentage: 57%\n- Passing yards: 170\n- Touchdowns: 1\n- Interceptions: 1\n- QB Rating: 108.6\n- Rush attempts: 10\n- Rushing yards: 38\nFinal score: Ohio State 14, Texas 7\nOhio State defeats Texas\nDown goes No. 1 in Columbus, as No. 2 Ohio State defeats the top-ranked Longhorns 14-7 after the Buckeyes defense comes up with a big time stop on fourth down against Arch Manning.\nOhio State comes up with fourth down stop\nThat looks to do it.\nOhio State dials up the pressure on fourth-and-5 and gets straight to Arch Manning, who dumps it off to Jack Endries before getting tackled, but Endries come up 2-yard short of the first down. The Buckeyes will take over after another fourth down stop.\nArch Manning, Jack Endries connect for first down\nHere comes Arch Manning and Texas!\nJust before the two-minute timeout in the fourth quarter, Manning throws a great ball down the field into the hands of his tight end, Jack Endries, for a 30-yard reception and the first down. A big time play there by Manning, who has been finding some rhythm late in this game after struggling in the first half.\nLonghorns have the ball on their own 45-yard line trailing 14-7 with two minutes remaining.\nTexas forces punt, Longhorns get ball back\nTexas defensive back Graceson Littleton comes up with a big tackle on third-and-10 to hold Brandon Inniss to a 5-yard reception to set up a timeout and a punt from the Buckeyes.\nArch Manning will now have 2:26 to lead Texas down the field for a potential game-tying scoring drive. Get the popcorn ready.\nArch Manning throws 32-yard touchdown\nArch Manning finally puts Texas on the board, as he finds Parker Livingstone for a 32-yard receiving touchdown into the right corner of the end zone. A great throw by Manning to Livingstone to give Texas some life with 3:28 remaining in the fourth quarter.\nThe Buckeyes now look to chew as much clock as they can on their upcoming drive with the score now 14-7.\nTexas turns it over on downs\nThe Longhorns struggles in the red zone continue, as Arch Manning's throw to Parker Livingstone is just out of reach in the right corner of the end zone on fourth-and-3. It's another turnover on downs caused by Ohio State's defense, which has impressed a lot throughout the afternoon.\nAfter getting to the Ohio State 9-yard line, Manning was unable to convert a first down as he threw back-to-back incomplete passes. Buckeyes take over with a 14-0 lead and 7:56 remaining in the fourth quarter.\nArch Manning interception overturned\nArch Manning catches a break after it looked like he was intercepted by the Ohio State defense for the second time on the afternoon. Officials originally ruled Ohio State's Sonny Styles made the catch on the pass deflection from Jermaine Matthews Jr. but video review showed otherwise.\nTexas remains out there on offense trailing Ohio State 14-0 in the fourth quarter.\nJulian Sayin throws 40-yard touchdown\nJulian Sayin extends Ohio State's lead over Texas to 14-0 with a 40-yard throw down the field to Carnell Tate. A really nice play there by Tate to hold onto the ball for the score.\nOhio State continues to hold all the momentum in this one.\nTexas shutout through three quarters\nAfter three quarters, Ohio State leads Texas 7-0 at Ohio Stadium. Noted by Fox's broadcast, it is the first time that Texas has been shutout through the first three quarters since 2015 vs. Iowa State.\nThird quarter: Ohio State 7, Texas 0\nOhio State intercepts Arch Manning\nArch Manning looks to throw down the field for the first time on the afternoon and it backfires as Jermaine Matthew Jr. picks off the Texas quarterback. A tough debut for Manning continues against Ohio State.\nThe Buckeyes take over at their own 32-yard line with 3:01 remaining the third quarter working with a 7-0 lead.\nTexas forces Ohio State to punt\nAfter turning it over on downs, Julian Sayin is not able to get Ohio State out of the back of its end zone. The Buckeyes are forced to punt the ball back to Texas, which now takes over at Ohio State's 50-yard line.\nThe Longhorns will once again look to punch through for the first time on the afternoon after not being able to score from the Buckeyes' 1-yard line on fourth-and-goal last time out.\nOhio State stuffs Texas at goal line\nTexas attempts to run a quarterback sneak from the Ohio State 1-yard line with Arch Manning but the Longhorns' quarterback is met by a swarm of Buckeyes defensive lineman for the goal line stop.\nAnother huge play for Ohio State's defense, and another costly one for Texas, which ran the ball four straight plays on that series. Buckeyes take over at their own 1-yard line with 6:40 remaining in the third quarter and a 7-0 lead.\nHere's another look at the Buckeyes stopping the Longhorns on the goal line:\nOhio State punts\nIt is a three and out to begin the second half for Ohio State on offense, as Texas defensive back Malik Muhammad breaks up a third-and-4 pass from Julian Sayin to Jeremiah Smith. A good start defensively for Texas, which now looks to get something going on offense for the first time this afternoon.\nArch Manning needs 'completions' for rhythm\nTexas football coach Steve Sarkisian told Fox's Tom Rinaldi that the Longhorns need to get Arch Manning some completions early in the third quarter to get their new starting quarterback into some rhythm. Manning struggled to find some rhythm in the first half vs. the Buckeyes defense, as he completed just 5 of 10 passes for 26 yards.\nFirst half: Ohio State 7, Texas 0\nLee Corso watching Ohio State-Texas from Ohio Stadium press box\nWhat will Lee Corso do first after retiring from \"College GameDay\"? Well, perhaps to no surprise, it is watching Ohio State vs. Texas from upstairs in the press box at Ohio Stadium.\nSaturday marked the last time the 90-year-old living legend will sit at the \"College GameDay\" desk as a member of the \"GameDay\" crew. He picked Brutus Buckeye and Ohio State for his final headgear pick, the 46th time he's picked the Buckeyes to win a game since the segment began in 1996.\nOhio State-Texas first half stats\nHere's a side-by-side comparison of the first half stats between Ohio State and Texas:\n- Total offense yards: Ohio State 103, Texas 79\n- Texas rushing yards: Texas 53, Ohio State 50\n- Total passing yards: Ohio State 19, Texas 16\n- First downs: Ohio State 7, Texas 4\n- Third down conversions: Ohio State 2-for-6, Texas 1-for-7\n- Penalties: Texas 4-35, Ohio State 0-0\nOhio State takes 7-0 lead into halftime\nCJ Donaldson's rushing touchdown in the second quarter gives No. 2 Ohio State a 7-0 lead going into halftime against No. 1 Texas. While both teams' offenses struggled in the opening half to find some rhythm, Texas struggled the most, as the Longhorns have only put together 79 total yards of offense compared to the Buckeyes' 103 yards.\nArch Manning finished 5 of 10 passing for 26 yards in the first half. Julian Sayin's stats aren't much different, as he finished 6 of 11 passing for 53 yards.\nOhio State leads Texas at two-minute timeout\nThe two-minute timeout has arrived in Columbus, as Ohio State leads Texas 7-0 thanks to CJ Donaldson's 1-yard rushing touchdown. The Buckeyes are facing a fourth-and-5 at their own 23-yard line coming out of the timeout.\nJulian Sayin makes big throw\nWow! In desperate need for a big play for the first down, Julian Sayin finds Carnell Tate along the sideline for a 9-yard catch and the first down. A really impressive play by the new Ohio State quarterback, who was facing a blitz from Texas' defense in the back of his own end zone.\nOhio State sacks Arch Manning\nOhio State once again comes up big defensively, as the Buckeyes' linebacker Arvell Reese gobbles up and sacks Arch Manning for a loss of 1-yard on third-and-10. Manning was trying to get out and up the field as the pocket collapsed but Reese was there to get the Longhorns' quarterback.\nBuckeyes defense has been all over Arch Manning in the first half thus far with pressures, a potential sign of what is to come in this new Matt Patricia defense in Columbus.\nArch Manning picks up Texas first down\nArch Manning takes it himself with a quarterback scramble to the left side of the field on third-and-3 with the pressure coming to pick up the first down. Don't see that everyday from a Manning!\nCJ Donaldson scores Ohio State touchdown\nAfter not being able to punch it through on third-and-2, CJ Donaldson breaks through the Texas defensive line into the end zone for the first scoring of the game. A risky call from Ohio State to go for it on fourth-and-1, instead of electing to take the field goal, pays to work out.\nThe Buckeyes scoring drive, which went for 13-plays and 80 yards and took eight minutes off the game clock, was set up by two costly penalties against the Longhorns defense: a 15-yard face mask penalty from Colin Simmons and a holding penalty from Malik Muhammad.\nFirst Quarter: Texas 0, Ohio State 0\nJeremiah Smith picks up 16-yard catch\nPrior to heading out for the drive, Fox's Jenny Taft reports Jeremiah Smith changed his gloves as the ones he originally was wearing \"weren't working.\" He then immediately picks up a 16-yard catch up the middle of the field on second-and-7 for his biggest catch of the game.\nCJ Donaldson then picks up a 5-yard gain to set up a second-and-5 for the Buckeyes' offense to begin the second quarter. It's 0-0 between Ohio State and Texas after one quarter of action.\nOhio State stuffs Arch Manning\nFacing a third-and-8 Ohio State dials up the pressure and stuffs Arch Manning, as the Texas quarterback gets back to the line of scrimmage. Another big stop on third down for Matt Patricia's unit, which has held Texas' offense to just 50 total yards of offense.\nBoth teams exchanging punts right now as both of their young quarterbacks settle in.\nOhio State punts\nOhio State can't convert on third and long, as Julian Sayin tries to go to Jeremiah Smith but the Buckeyes star wide receiver drops the pass. It's the second drop of the series from Smith, who now has three targets.\nIt's a six-play, 17-yard drive for Ohio State that took 2:59 off the game clock.\nOhio State converts on third down\nOhio State quarterback Julian Sayin converts a third-and-3 with an 11-yard throw up the field to Max Klare. A nice throw and catch between Sayin and Klare keeps the Buckeyes offense out on the field.\nJeremiah Smith has only two targets so far on the afternoon.\nMax Klare drops catch on fourth down\nOhio State quarterback Julian Sayin looks to have picked up the first down on fourth-and-1 when he finds Max Klare open across the middle of the field, but the Purdue tight end transfer can't hold onto the ball. A costly drop by Klare gives Texas and Arch Manning the ball back at their own 49-yard line.\nBoth teams defenses coming up big early in this one.\nOhio State gets fourth down stop\nFool me once, don't fool me twice \u2014 right?\nRegardless if that catchphrase is correct or not, Ohio State defensive coordinator Matt Patricia dials up the pressure on fourth-and-2 and gets the stop as the Buckeyes' defense stuffs Texas running back CJ Baxter at the line for just a gain of 1-yard. Big bounce back from Ohio State after not being able to get the previous fourth downs top.\nBuckeyes take over at their own 42-yard line.\nTexas converts fourth down\nOfficials give Texas the first down on a quarterback sneak on fourth-and-1. Gutsy call from Steve Sarkisian to go for it early in the game, especially with the Longhorn still on their side of the field. Arch Manning's running ability could become a key factor for the Longhorns offense on the day.\nArch Manning throws incomplete pass on first play\nThe first passing attempt from Arch Manning on the day is incomplete as it falls short of reaching Michael Taaffe on the right side of the field. Second-and-10 coming up for the Longhorns.\nOhio State wins toss, Texas up first\nThe Buckeyes win the toss and defer to the second half meaning it will be Arch Manning and the Texas offense coming out first. Underway in Columbus!\nPregame\nLee Corso picks Ohio State in final headgear pick\nThe final headgear pick of Lee Corso's illustrious career on \"College GameDay\" goes to who else but Ohio State, as he put on the Brutus Buckeye headgear at midfield in front of everyone inside Ohio Stadium.\nUSMNT coach Maurico Pochettino leads OH-IO chant\nDuring an appearance on Fox's \"Big Noon Kickoff,\" the United States men's national team coach Maurico Pochettino lead an OH-IO chant with Buckeyes fans outside of Ohio Stadium.\nPochettino was also caught catching up with well-known Texas fan Matthew McConaughey on the field inside the stadium.\nMatthew McConaughey seen at Texas-Ohio State\nThe \"Minister of Culture,\" Matthew McConaughey, is in Columbus to watch his Texas Longhorns take on Ohio State. Fox's broadcast cameras caught the Texas alum sharing a moment on the field at Ohio Stadium with former Longhorns' coach Mack Brown.\nBrown went 1-1 against Ohio State while he was at Texas, with that win coming in 2005 at Ohio Stadium when the Longhorns defense sacked Ohio State quarterback Troy Smith in the Buckeyes' end zone for a safety to seal the win.\nRyan Day\u2019s record vs SEC teams\nIn his six seasons as the Buckeyes\u2019 full-time coach, Ryan Day is 2-3 against SEC teams. The 46-year-old coach entered last year\u2019s CFP first-round matchup vs. Tennessee winless vs. SEC teams.\nHere\u2019s a game-by-game breakdown of how Ohio State has fared against SEC teams under Day:\n- Jan. 11, 2021: (1) Alabama 52, (3) Ohio State 24 (College Football Playoff championship)\n- Dec. 31, 2022: (1) Georgia 42, (4) Ohio State (College Football Playoff Peach Bowl semifinal)\n- Dec. 29, 2023: Missouri 14, Ohio State 3 (Cotton Bowl)\n- Dec. 21, 2024: (6) Ohio State 42, (7) Tennessee 17 (College Football Playoff first-round)\n- Jan. 10, 2025: (6) Ohio State 28, (4) Texas 14 (College Football Playoff Cotton Bowl semifinal)\nSteve Sarkisian\u2019s record vs Big Ten teams\nTexas coach Steve Sarkisian holds a 2-3 record against Big Ten programs across his three head coaching stops at Washington, USC and Texas. He is 0-1 against Big Ten programs with the Longhorns, with that lone loss being last year\u2019s CFP Cotton Bowl semifinal.\nHere\u2019s a game-by-game breakdown of how Sarkisian\u2019s teams have fared vs. Big Ten teams:\n- Sept. 17, 2011: No. 11 Nebraska 51, Washington 38\n- Sept. 14, 2013: No. 19 Washington 34, Illinois 24\n- Dec. 27, 2014: No. 24 USC 45, No. 25 Nebraska 42 (Holiday Bowl)\n- Dec. 30, 2015: No. 23 Wisconsin 23, USC 21 (Holiday Bowl)\n- Jan. 10, 2025: (6) Ohio State 28, (4) Texas 14 (College Football Playoff Cotton Bowl semifinal)\nArch Manning takes field vs Ohio State\nThe Deputy has taken the field at Ohio Stadium for his first start as Texas' full-time starting quarterback. A big test in store for Arch Manning and the Longhorns on Saturday, as they will have to go up against Ohio State star safety Caleb Downs.\nRyan Day gives Lee Corso special Ohio State helmet on 'College GameDay'\nWhile appearing on \"College GameDay,\" Ohio State football coach Ryan Day presented Lee Corso with his very own Buckeye helmet that included a Buckeye leaf sticker for each time (45) that he has put on Brutus Buckeye, Ohio State's mascot, in his legendary headgear pick segment.\nClick here to read more on Ohio State's gift to Corso.\nSteve Sarkisian on Lee Corso\nTalking to ESPN's Jen Lada inside Ohio Stadium on \"College GameDay,\" Texas football coach Steve Sarkisian offered his thoughts on the impact Lee Corso has made on college football over the years.\n\"We wouldn't be where we are today, in the state of college football without you,\" Sarkisian said.\nWho is starting at quarterback for Ohio State vs Texas?\nJulian Sayin is starting at quarterback for Ohio State in its Week 1 opener vs. Texas.
