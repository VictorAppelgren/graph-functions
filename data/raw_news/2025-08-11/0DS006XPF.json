  "content": "Heartbroken David and Victoria Beckham devastatingly fear their eldest son Brooklyn has 'quit the family' after he failed to invite any of his relatives to his vow renewal.\n\nBrooklyn and wife Nicola Peltz, who first wed in 2022, said 'I do' for a second time on August 2 in Westchester County in front of her family who had key roles in the day, with the Beckham clan no where in sight.\n\nNicola wore her 70-year-old mother's vintage 1985 bridal gown for the big day, while her father Nelson, 83, was given the key role of officiating.\n\nBrooklyn's parents and siblings Romeo, 22, Cruz, 20, and Harper, 14, reportedly only found out about their big day after reading about it on a US website.\n\nTheir eldest son has become increasingly estranged from the family ever since he snubbed his father's 50th birthday, and now, the family fear it's a final kick in the teeth for the family.\n\nA source told The Sun: This was the final kick in the teeth for David and Victoria. Seeing Nelson having such a pivotal role at the ceremony was heartbreaking for David especially. Not one member of the 30-plus extended family knew about the wedding, or were invited.\n\n'His grandparents are devastated too as Brooklyn has always been so close to them.'\n\nThe source added: 'It feels cruel and spiteful. This is no longer a game. It has gone beyond all that. This is a family who feel they have lost their precious boy - and see no way back.\n\n'Honestly, they are now questioning why he even wants to keep the \u2018Beckham\u2019 surname - will he revert to Peltz? August 2nd 2025 - is this the day Brooklyn formally declared himself no longer a part of the Beckham family? It certainly feels like it.'.\n\nDaily Mail has contacted Brooklyn, Nicola and the Beckhams' representatives for comment.\n\nBrooklyn and Nicola first tied the knot in a lavish \u00a33million ceremony in 2022, when relations first began to sour with his parents in the run up to the big day.\n\nAfter shunning a dress made by her fashion designer Victoria in favour of a Valentino gown in 2022 - a choice which wasn\u2019t well received - Nicola once again snubbed her mother-in-law and wore her mother Claudia's vintage wedding gown.\n\nIt is a poignant message to Posh and Becks', whom he and Nicola have grown increasingly estranged over recent months.\n\nAll the while the Beckhams were said to be upset by the Peltzes in 2022 who they felt were taking over the wedding.\n\nAnd ever since their first big nuptials in April 2022, the two families have not reunited and Nicola has rarely been pictured with the Beckhams.\n\nThe couple shared the images on Instagram on Monday, alongside the words 'only love.'\n\nNicola wore the same original $1.8mill ring set adding a glinting filter onto the dazzling jewels.\n\nThey also shared a video of their very casual proposal on TikTok alongside a song by Ysabelle Cuevas alongside the words: 'Lost in your eyes..'\n\nBrooklyn described the vow renewal as a 'really beautiful experience' while admitting he is still head-over-heels for his wife.\n\nSpeaking for the first time about the day, the 26-year-old admitted he'd happily do it 'every single day' if he could.\n\nBrooklyn said the moment was all about creating a 'really cute memory' they'd treasure forever.\n\nNicola was by his side as they exchanged longer vows than their original wedding, a detail Brooklyn confessed may cause a problem for his already inked tribute.\n\nSpeaking to People he said: 'It was beautiful. We just wanted a really beautiful experience - a really cute memory.\n\n'To be honest, I could renew my vows every single day with her. I think the most important thing that someone can do is find that person that they're going to spend the rest of their life with.\n\n'It definitely shapes you as a person. It was really, really cute. It was really fun.'\n\nThe eldest Beckham has his first set of vows tattooed on his arm and now admits he'll have to 'find space' for the new ones.\n\nThe ceremony was a far cry from their first glitzy bash, with the couple opting for a smaller, more personal event surrounded by their four dogs.\n\nFar from being a party-loving celeb couple, Brooklyn says their favourite nights are spent at home, sipping wine and cooking together.\n\nThe pair began dating back in October 2019, went Instagram official a few months later, and by July 2020, Brooklyn had popped the question.\n\nIn another turn of events, the son of David and Victoria said he is keen to remind fans not to stress over life timelines, revealing that he didn't discover his career passion until his early twenties and now he's the proud owner of hot sauce brand Cloud23.\n\nBrooklyn added that Nicola played a major role in his business journey, pushing him to pursue food after he confessed he wasn't sure what career path to take.\n\nIt all started, he admitted, after 'getting really drunk one night' and experimenting with making hot sauce in their kitchen.\n\nThat tipsy trial run turned into a full-blown business, with Brooklyn spotting a gap in the market for high-end hot sauces with clean ingredients.\n\nTwo flavours - Hot Habanero and Sweet Jalape\u00f1o - are now on sale and both featured in his recent Airbnb Originals Experience event in Los Angeles.\n\nGuests at the party were served spicy pickle martinis infused with his sauce before learning how to whip up chimichurri from celebrity chef Aaron May.\n\nBrooklyn revealed that cooking is his 'favourite thing', whether it's for Nicola, friends, or even the couple's beloved pets.\n\nHis go-to dish is spaghetti bolognese - but with a twist - a whole bottle of red wine and a cork thrown into the pot for good luck.\n\nBrooklyn said: 'I add a whole bottle of red wine. The cheapest red wine is always the best for bolognese. I actually put 10 bay leaves in there.'\n\nHe added: 'I don't know where I learned this, but I put the cork of the wine in the pot. I don't think it does anything. Then, I just marinate it for five hours.'\n\nAnd when he's entertaining, Brooklyn confessed candles, good music, and low lighting are his non-negotiable.\n\nBrooklyn's parents David and Victoria have been enjoying their annual summer break on their \u00a316 million yacht in Europe.\n\nBut he and Nicola have kept away amid an ongoing family feud, as the pair lived it up on a \u00a385million vessel that dwarfs his parents' close by the week before.\n\nThe family has been thrown into turmoil in recent months as it has been claimed Brooklyn has become increasingly estranged from his famous parents after failing to attend any of his father David's 50th birthday celebrations in May.\n\nIt was also revealed that Brooklyn and Nicola's Instagram accounts no longer follow his younger brothers in the latest family drama.\n\nHowever, Brooklyn's friends told Daily Mail that Cruz and Romeo have actually blocked them on the social media platform.\n\nThis would make sense given that Brooklyn and Nicola are still following Victoria and David.\n\nBrooklyn also didn't wish either his mum Victoria or dad David a happy birthday on social media - an unusual move for the Beckhams, who are known for their loving posts.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to a post Brooklyn shared recently for his father-in-law and wrote on a picture of himself and Nicola with the billionaire: 'Happy birthday Nelson x We love you.'",

      "text": "Cookin' with Brooklyn? He's as dim as a tomato and dextrous as a chimp in oven gloves! JAN MOIR's deliciously tart verdict on Beckham Jnr's bid to be a TV chef\nBrooklyn Beckham has a new cooking show, which is interesting because even Brooklyn Beckham acknowledges he can't cook very well and only started during the pandemic.\n'This is like my road to becoming a chef,' he says. Well I guess it's much easier than the other road, the one that involves actually working in a restaurant kitchen and 12-hour shifts on the minimum wage for four years. That's before you are even allowed to garnish a main course with a sprig of parsley.\nYet, to be fair, the 22-year-old son of David and Victoria Beckham seems to be humbly aware of his limitations. 'I don't know if I'll become a great chef,' he muses in one episode, 'but it's all about the journey.'\nOne eight-minute episode shows how to make a 'Brooklyn Special' bagel sandwich cost around \u00a375,000 and involved a team of 62 people\nAs his voyage around the kitchen unfolds, Brooklyn shares each revelatory step on his path to culinary excellence.\n'Vegan sausage, it cooks so much like a normal sausage,' he notes at one point.\nElsewhere, he shows an impressive depth of knowledge when it comes to dairy produce. 'I love cheese,' he says. 'It's like butter.'\nHe also displays a mastery of the philosophy and technique of chopping vegetables. 'Dicing is like making it smaller.'\nCookin' With Brooklyn is not a traditional television show, but a series of short films that stream on Instagram to his 13.2 million followers \u2014 incidentally more than Jamie Oliver with 8.9million fans, but slightly less than Gordon Ramsay with 13.4 million.\nYou might think this is a home-cooked conceit, rather like vanity publishing, because these days you don't need a television company to green-light your pet project when you have so many online fans.\nYou can just get out there and do it yourself, especially if Mummy and Daddy are millionaires and feeling generous.\nHowever, the copyright on the films is owned by Meta, formerly Facebook, which must think it is on to something.\nOne eight-minute episode that shows how to make a 'Brooklyn Special' bagel sandwich cost around \u00a375,000 and involved a team of 62 people, including six camera operators and someone called a 'culinary producer'.\nPresumably he or she is there to eliminate any gastronomic or technical gaffes and if so \u2014 pass me that megaphone, please \u2014 WAKE UP AT THE BACK.\n'Brooklyn is the birthplace of bagels,' states our hero in one sequence, which will be news to the Jewish communities of Poland in the 17th century who had them for breakfast most mornings.\nHe enthuses about a little-known crunchy delicacy listed in an on-screen caption as Cole Slaw. Who he? Sounds like a trombonist who once formed a jazz trio with fellow Cole Porter and a merry soul called Old King.\nCookin' With Brooklyn is not a traditional television show, but a series of short films that stream on Instagram to his 13.2 million followers\nIn every single cooking segment in the test kitchen \u2014 when Brooklyn is, say, crisping rice in bubbling oil or browning butter \u2014 the saucepan handles are turned outwards and I want to scream.\nSafety rule number one in any kitchen, domestic or professional, is to turn the handles of pots and pans inward so you can't knock them off the hob and spill something or burn yourself.\nWe all know this, but neither Brooklyn nor the dozens involved in this production seem to have a clue, which says it all, really.\nStill, one of the quiet joys of life is watching an expert deploy their skills and craftsmanship; admiring the artisan in his atelier, the artist at her canvas.\nBrooklyn Beckham cooking is not like that. If you sent a blindfolded chimp into space wearing oven gloves and asked it to ice roses on to a wedding cake in zero gravity, that might give you some idea of the level of dexterity we are talking about.\nIn a segment filmed for the TV's Good Morning America, Brooklyn tried to pick up a fried egg with a pair of tongs.\nWatch him here spreading mayonnaise on a bun, slicing an uncomplaining potato or staring into the depths of a deep-fat fryer like a man confused by the mysteries of the universe.\nIn the Sushi episode, he goes to Nobu to meet celebrity chef and family friend Nobu Matsuhisa (pictured), who is going to teach him how to make sushi\nHow do you know when it's done?' he asks, pointing to a hash brown sizzling away. Patience, young grasshopper. All will be revealed in the next lesson, along with Boiling A Kettle and Ice Cubes The Easy Way.\nEmbarrassingly for us as a nation, there seems to be some kind of UK gastro theme going on, as Brooklyn explains to the world the inspiration behind his signature dishes such as his Fish & Chips Bagel and his Bangers & Mash with Onion Gravy.\n'English food is food that I grew up on,' he says.\nOf course he grew up with a family chef in situ when he was not eating at the finest restaurants with his parents.\nIn the Sushi episode, he goes to Nobu to meet celebrity chef and family friend Nobu Matsuhisa, who is going to teach him how to make sushi.\nIn the real world, it takes 15 years to become a sushi chef, but Brooklyn breezes through it in five minutes, aided by his personal collection of initialled Japanese knives, worth thousands of pounds.\n'Very important, very sharp,' he says and by now viewers will have gleaned he is not talking about himself.\nHe meets other experts, such as LA chef Nancy Silverton and someone called Adam Perry Lang, who was Jeffrey Epstein's chef, which is awkward, so let's move on. He visits an English pub in Los Angeles, a question burning on his questing foodie lips.\n'How do you make mashed potatoes?' he asks.\nBrooklyn comes across as rather sweet, but as dim as a tomato. 'Even you can do this recipe,' Nancy Silverton says, showing him how to make a pecan tart.\nStill, you have to wonder who or what Cookin' With Brooklyn is for, given that there are no recipes, no instructions, no technique and precious little real cooking actually going on \u2014 just a bit of frying, boiling and assembly.\nIt's a souffle of insubstantiality, pointless except to his most devoted fans. A cynic might conclude it's just another half-baked attempt by Brooklyn to find some kind of famous-person career for himself; somewhere to bloom on the celebrity trellis in Hollywood.\nHe tried football when he was a teenager but didn't score there. Then he was a photographer and in 2017 published a book of his photographs called What I See.\n'Elephants in Kenya. So hard to photograph, but incredible to see,' he wrote. Well maybe now, he can pan-fry one instead.\nIn this scramble for celebrity, perhaps he just alighted on making a series called Cookin' With Brooklyn because of the snappy title.\nIf he had been called something different, maybe the show and his entire life might have been different, too.\nTennis With Dennis. Golf with Rolf. Fighter Jet Flying With Ryan. Smelting With Elton. Let's stop it there.\nYes, it must be crippling for young men and women with real talent in the photography and cooking fields to see this no-hoper bumbling around getting lots of attention and exposure, including a recent slot on The Late Show with family friend James Corden.\nAnd every step forward paved by the success of his parents instead of the efforts of himself.\nBut, as the gem lettuce said to the radicchio, in a joke I don't expect Brooklyn Beckham or his team to understand, it's best not to be bitter. So let's wish him well.\n'It's a lot harder than you think,' said Brooklyn to Nobu, when the master was showing him how to make sushi rolls. It is thinking that it was easy in the first place that is the problem here.\nMost watched News videos\n- Moment passengers 'stop' man who pulled down trousers on tube\n- Moment Cycling Mikey pushes bike into a car after furious row\n- Shocking moment man is gored to death after charging at bull\n- Shocking moment woman strikes flight attendant before being removed\n- Family-friendly restaurant Cracker Barrel unveils bold new look\n- Chinese Navy ship collides with own vessel while chasing boat\n- Chinese navy vessel collides with one of its own chasing Philippine boat\n- Kristen Welker calls out JB Pritzker over Gerrymandering\n- Florida man knocks out kayakers while attempting a DAREDEVIL leap\n- Hawaii ferry is tossed by strong waves before being run aground\n- Father of children mowed down in Oatlands tragedy confronts killer\n- Jennifer Lopez has an unexpected guest during her concert"

      "text": "- Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBrooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz have shared pictures of their secret vow renewal ceremony officiated by her father Nelson, and while Brooklyn's parents were very much absent amid their feud, Nicola's parents had very key roles.\nWhen billionaire Nelson, 83, took centre stage at the big day which was held on his estate on August 2 in Westchester County, Brooklyn's parents were nowhere to be seen.\nBrooklyn and Nicola first tied the knot in a lavish \u00a33million ceremony in 2022, when relations first began to sour with his parents in the run up to the big day.\nAfter shunning a dress made by her fashion designer Victoria in favour of a Valentino gown in 2022 - a choice which wasn\u2019t well received - Nicola once again snubbed her mother-in-law and wore her mother Claudia's, 70, 1985 vintage bridal gown.\nIt is a poignant message to Posh and Becks', whom he and Nicola have grown increasingly estranged over recent months after failing to attend any of his father's 50th birthday celebrations in May.\nThis time round, Nicola opted for another bridal style gown which had flower embellishments on the shoulder and puff sleeves, with a matching veil.\nAll the while the Beckhams were said to be upset by the Peltzes in 2022 who they felt were taking over the wedding.\nBrooklyn Beckham, 26, and Nicola Peltz, 30, have shared pictures of their secret vow renewal ceremony officiated by her father Nelson, and while Brooklyn's parents were very much absent amid their feud , Nicola's parents had very key roles\nWhile billionaire Nelson took centre stage at the big day which was held on his estate on August 2 in Westchester County, Brooklyn's parents were nowhere to be seen\nAfter shunning a dress made by Victoria in favour of a Valentino gown in 2022, Nicola once again snubbed her mother-in-law and wore her mother Claudia's 1985 wedding dress (her first wedding dress seen left, her second wedding dress pictured right)\nNicola wore her model mother Claudia's, 70, vintage wedding dress - She and Nelson, 83, married in the eighties (pictured) and went on to have eight children\nIt is a poignant message to Posh and Becks', whom he and Nicola have grown increasingly estranged over recent months after failing to attend any of his father's 50th birthday celebrations in May\nBrooklyn and Nicola first tied the knot in a lavish \u00a33million ceremony in 2022 (pictured), when relations first began to sour with his parents in the run up to the big day\nAll the while the Beckhams (pictured at their sons wedding in 2022) were said to be upset by the Peltzes who they felt were taking over the wedding\nAnd ever since their first big nuptials in April 2022, the two families have not reunited and Nicola has rarely been pictured with the Beckhams.\nThe couple shared the images on Instagram on Monday, alongside the words 'only love.'\nNicola wore the same original $1.8mill ring set adding a glinting filter onto the dazzling jewels.\nThey also shared a video of their very casual proposal on TikTok alongside a song by Ysabelle Cuevas alongside the words: 'Lost in your eyes..'\nBrooklyn described the vow renewal as a 'really beautiful experience' while admitting he is still head-over-heels for his wife.\nSpeaking for the first time about the day, the 26-year-old admitted he'd happily do it 'every single day' if he could.\nBrooklyn said the moment was all about creating a 'really cute memory' they'd treasure forever.\nNicola was by his side as they exchanged longer vows than their original wedding, a detail Brooklyn confessed may cause a problem for his already inked tribute.\nNicola up-cycled her 70-year-old mother's vintage wedding gown, after shunning her mother-in-law's gesture to make her bridal gown in 2022\nNicola also shared this video of Brooklyn's second proposal to her\nThe pair began dating back in October 2019, went Instagram official a few months later, and by July 2020, Brooklyn had popped the question (their engagement post pictured)\nNicola hard launched their relationship on social media back in 2019, sharing a racy mirror selfie (pictured)\nSpeaking to People he said: 'It was beautiful. We just wanted a really beautiful experience - a really cute memory.\n'To be honest, I could renew my vows every single day with her. I think the most important thing that someone can do is find that person that they're going to spend the rest of their life with.\n'It definitely shapes you as a person. It was really, really cute. It was really fun.'\nThe eldest Beckham has his first set of vows tattooed on his arm and now admits he'll have to 'find space' for the new ones.\nThe ceremony was a far cry from their first glitzy bash, with the couple opting for a smaller, more personal event surrounded by their four dogs.\nFar from being a party-loving celeb couple, Brooklyn says their favourite nights are spent at home, sipping wine and cooking together.\nThe pair began dating back in October 2019, went Instagram official a few months later, and by July 2020, Brooklyn had popped the question.\nIn another turn of events, the son of David and Victoria Beckham said he is keen to remind fans not to stress over life timelines, revealing that he didn't discover his career passion until his early twenties and now he's the proud owner of hot sauce brand Cloud23.\nMeanwhile, David, 50, and Victoria, 51, Beckham continued soaking up the sun on their \u00a316m superyacht off the Tuscan coast amid their lavish Italian getaway on Sunday\nThe former footballer and Spice Girl enjoyed a spot of reading while topping up their tans after he was caught cheekily pinching her bottom\nThe loved-up couple decided to say 'I do' all over again on August 2 in what Brooklyn described as 'a really beautiful experience'\nThe ceremony was a far cry from their first glitzy bash, with the couple opting for a smaller, more personal event surrounded by their four dogs\nBrooklyn added that Nicola played a major role in his business journey, pushing him to pursue food after he confessed he wasn't sure what career path to take.\nIt all started, he admitted, after 'getting really drunk one night' and experimenting with making hot sauce in their kitchen.\nThat tipsy trial run turned into a full-blown business, with Brooklyn spotting a gap in the market for high-end hot sauces with clean ingredients.\nTwo flavours - Hot Habanero and Sweet Jalape\u00f1o - are now on sale and both featured in his recent Airbnb Originals Experience event in Los Angeles.\nGuests at the party were served spicy pickle martinis infused with his sauce before learning how to whip up chimichurri from celebrity chef Aaron May.\nHis go-to dish is spaghetti bolognese - but with a twist - a whole bottle of red wine and a cork thrown into the pot for good luck.\nBrooklyn said: 'I add a whole bottle of red wine. The cheapest red wine is always the best for bolognese. I actually put 10 bay leaves in there.'\nHe added: 'I don't know where I learned this, but I put the cork of the wine in the pot. I don't think it does anything. Then, I just marinate it for five hours.'\nAnd when he's entertaining, Brooklyn confessed candles, good music, and low lighting are his non-negotiable.\nBrooklyn's parents David and Victoria have been enjoying their annual summer break on their \u00a316 million yacht in Europe.\nBut he and Nicola have kept away amid an ongoing family feud, as the pair lived it up on a \u00a385million vessel that dwarfs his parents' close by the week before.\nThe family has been thrown into turmoil in recent months as it has been claimed Brooklyn has become increasingly estranged from his famous parents after failing to attend any of his father David's 50th birthday celebrations in May.\nHowever, Brooklyn's friends told Daily Mail that Cruz and Romeo have actually blocked them on the social media platform.\nThe family has been thrown into turmoil in recent months as it has been claimed Brooklyn has become increasingly estranged from his famous parents after failing to attend any of his father David's 50th birthday celebrations in May. [the family seen before the feud]\nThis would make sense given that Brooklyn and Nicola are still following Victoria and David.\nBrooklyn also didn't wish either his mum Victoria or dad David a happy birthday on social media - an unusual move for the Beckhams, who are known for their loving posts.\nThis is in stark contrast to a post Brooklyn shared recently for his father-in-law and wrote on a picture of himself and Nicola with the billionaire: 'Happy birthday Nelson x We love you.'"

His dad is seen in his No 23 jersey in 2003\nSources say that Brooklyn's billionaire father-in-law Nelson Peltz has been advising him on building his empire\nThere are plenty of signs of an initial focus on hot sauce - something the Daily Mail previously revealed was a plan in the works for Brooklyn, who took up cooking during the pandemic and now makes a living as a culinary social media star\nThere are plenty of signs of an initial focus on hot sauce - something the Daily Mail previously revealed was a plan in the works for Brooklyn, who took up cooking during the pandemic and now makes a living as a culinary social media star.\nHe\u2019s asked to trademark Cloud 23 for a range of sauces from Worcestershire and steak to ketchup, mayo, aioli, as well as all kinds of chili including sriracha, picante, pico de gallo, chimichurri and wasabi.\nOn the sweet side there are mentions of maple syrup, honey, raspberry coulis and chocolate sauce.\nThe company is also seeking to trademark Cloud 23 guacamole, tahini and tapenade.\nBut interestingly, Cloud 23 is going to live up to its name and be a brand in the virtual world, too.\nBeckham is seeking trademarks for the 'provision of an online marketplace for buyers and sellers of hot sauce' and for selling other food and beverage products virtually, for use in a virtual world.\nAnd it\u2019s not just virtual food and drink that the Cloud 23 label could cover.\nTrademarks are also being sought for 'providing online, non-downloadable virtual footwear, clothing, headwear, eyewear, bags, sports bags, backpacks, sports equipment, art, toys, toy accessories, digital animated and non-animated designs and characters, avatars, digital overlays, and skins for use in virtual environments.'\nBrooklyn requested the trademarks under his Californian company called Peltz Beckham - the blended family name he took after marrying model Nicola Peltz (seen in December) last year\nBrooklyn has spent years trying his hand at different careers - including modeling, photography, and soccer - before turning to cooking, and he's faced scrutiny over his jobs\nOver the years, Brooklyn (seen with his family) has been slammed for the opportunities he's received, with many accusing him of only getting them due to his family name\nIt will provide those virtual environments, too; where 'users can interact for recreational, leisure, or entertainment purposes.'\nIf all this sounds like a completely different world to you, you\u2019re not alone.\nMetaverse platforms like Roblox, Decentraland and The Sandbox have massive in-game economies where revenue can be generated by selling folks everything their avatar desires.\nUsers dress up their characters with skins (not actual epidermis, rather digital decorations), and purchase virtual clothing to express individuality and demonstrate status. All of which can be resold, or swapped with other avatars.\nAnother, slightly easier to understand, application seeks to brand the 'streaming of entertainment content and live streaming of entertainment events via an online environment.'\nDailyMail.com has contacted Brooklyn's spokesperson for comment.\nMeanwhile, back in the (real) kitchen, critics have carped at the standard of Brooklyn\u2019s cooking, which sits more at the well-funded amateur end of the spectrum.\nIn his Cookin\u2019 With Brooklyn series on Facebook in 2022, he asked a chef how he would know when a hash brown was cooked, and appeared to have no idea how to batter or fry fish. There were 62 crew on the show.\nBrooklyn has also received a lot of negative responses over the creation of his show in general, with some people slamming him for landing his own series even though he never completed any culinary training.\nBrooklyn has spent years trying his hand at different careers - including modeling, photography, and soccer - and over the years, he has faced immense scrutiny over some of the other opportunities that he's received, with many accusing him of only getting them due to his family name.\nBack in 2016, when Brooklyn was hired to shoot a Burberry campaign at age 16 - despite having very little experience - prominent photographer Chris Floyd branded it as 'sheer nepotism,' while fashion snapper Jon Gorrigan described it as an 'injustice.'\nDespite this, he has built an online following of more than 16.4 million on Instagram which has allowed him to pick up endorsement deals with companies including Dunkin Donuts, Typhur cookware, Chosen foods and sake purveyors Wesake, in which he is an investor.\nBrooklyn has admitted he\u2019s been looking for something he would 'literally die for,' said he 'found that with cooking.'\nHe also insisted to Insider in October that he was 'working his bum off' and stated that he would not be stopping any time soon because 'cooking makes him happy.'\n'To be honest, I'm used to the hate. It doesn't really bother me. Cooking makes me happy,' he said.\n'I have more important things to worry about than people saying a little bit of rubbish about me.\nBrooklyn's father David picked the No 23 shirt when he moved to play for Real Madrid because his preferred No 7, which he wore at Manchester United, was not available\nHis new number was a nod to his 'ultimate sporting hero,' the legendary basketball player Michael Jordan, who wore the No 23 jersey throughout his career\nBrooklyn's nod towards his dad in his new brand is a big move considering that rumors erupted in 2022 that he had a falling out with his parents over his relationship with Nicola\n'My message to them is to keep writing whatever they want to write. There are always going to be people out there who try and pull you down.\n'I'm doing my thing and working my bum off. So they can keep writing what they want, but it's not going to bother me - I'm just going to keep doing my thing.'\nHe will have some way to go, though, to emulate the business success of his parents, who have built Brand Beckham into a huge empire of endorsements and enterprises, including a football team in Miami for David, a fashion and beauty line for Victoria, and deals with Maserati and Adidas. Collectively, the couple is worth around $450 million.\nBrooklyn's father David picked the No 23 shirt when he moved to play for Real Madrid because his preferred No 7, which he wore at Manchester United, was not available (being already taken by Spanish footballer Raul).\nHis new number was a nod to his 'ultimate sporting hero,' the legendary basketball player Michael Jordan, who wore the No 23 jersey throughout his career.\nBrooklyn developed a passion for the sport when the family was living in LA, and his dad would regularly take him to watch the Lakers.\nBrooklyn's nod towards his dad in his new brand is a big move considering that rumors erupted in 2022 that he had a falling out with his parents over his relationship with Nicola.\nThe alleged fight started at his and Nicola's wedding, when it was reported that the former Victoria and David were not seated at the bride and groom's table.\nAn onlooker claimed that the Beckhams 'were not at the forefront' and that the 'wedding was all about the Peltz family.'\nThere also seemed to be tensions over Nicola's wedding dress, as Nicola said in an interview with Grazia that fashion guru Victoria was supposed to make her gown but seemingly accused her of backing out of their agreement.\nAfter that, fans began to notice that Nicola and Victoria - who previously fawned over each other's pictures online - started scarcely liking each other's pictures on social media.\nRumors were intensified when Brooklyn missed his family vacation in June 2022 to spend time with his wife's relatives instead.\nThe alleged fight started over Nicola's wedding dress, as Nicola said that fashion guru Victoria was supposed to make her gown but backed out. They're seen in 2021\nIt seems as though tensions have died down as Brooklyn and Nicola were seen celebrating Christmas in the Bahamas with David and Victoria and the rest of his family recently\nA source told DailyMail.com that September that Victoria was 'heartbroken' over the fallout with her daughter-in-law Nicola and the strain it put on her relationship with Brooklyn.\nBut weeks later, the family seemed to put the feud to rest as they reunited to attend Victoria's Paris Fashion Week show.\nIt was said that Brooklyn and David had a confrontation before the event, with a source telling DailyMail.com, 'I don't think David has ever lost his temper with Brooklyn or had cause to talk to him harshly, but that has now finally happened.\n'He had it out with him and told him: \"We don't do this in our family \u2013 and you know that we don't do this in our family,\"' they added, regarding Nicola's Grazia interview.\nDavid reported told Brooklyn: 'What happens next is up to you, but we are done with the drama.'\n'David was really appalled by the Grazia interview because it seemed to be washing the family dirty linen in public \u2013 and he said that [Brooklyn's brothers] Romeo and Cruz are also hurt by it,' the insider continued.\n'It was probably a shock as he's never done anything other than tell Brooklyn how much he adores him.'\nSince then, it seems as though tensions have died down as Victoria and David wished Nicola a happy birthday in early 2023 on social media.\nIn addition, the couple has been spending time with their son and his wife numerous times in the last year, and they even jetted off to the Bahamas together with the rest of his family to celebrate Christmas.\nMost watched News videos\n- Moment passengers 'stop' man who pulled down trousers on tube\n- Moment Cycling Mikey pushes bike into a car after furious row\n- Shocking moment man is gored to death after charging at bull\n- Shocking moment woman strikes flight attendant before being removed\n- Kristen Welker calls out JB Pritzker over Gerrymandering\n- Family-friendly restaurant Cracker Barrel unveils bold new look\n- Chinese navy vessel collides with one of its own chasing Philippine boat\n- Chinese Navy ship collides with own vessel while chasing boat\n- Florida man knocks out kayakers while attempting a DAREDEVIL leap\n- Hawaii ferry is tossed by strong waves before being run aground\n- Father of children mowed down in Oatlands tragedy confronts killer\n- Jennifer Lopez has an unexpected guest during her concert"

Pictured: The couple on holiday in St Tropez earlier this week\nBrooklyn's friends claimed to MailOnline on Friday that Cruz and Romeo have actually blocked them on the social media channel (pictured together in 2023)\nAnd this would make sense as Brooklyn and Nicola are still following his parents Victoria and David\nCruz and Romeo were still following Brooklyn and Nicola on Friday but appeared to take action after Brooklyn posted a birthday tribute to sister Harper, sharing a family photo which excluded them and which Nicola reposted\nMeanwhile, Brooklyn and Romeo have been living a somewhat fractious relationship over the last few months following claims Romeo's ex-girlfriend Kim Turnbull was the reason behind their rift.\nKim addressed the speculation June 16 and insisted she has only ever had a friendship with the eldest Beckham son.\nSharing a statement on her Instagram page, she said: 'I've avoided speaking on this topic to prevent adding fuel to the fire, however it's come to a point where I feel the need to address it so I can move on.\n'I will not continue to receive harassment or be embarrassed on the basis of lies, to fit a certain narrative.\n'I have never been romantically involved in ANY capacity at ANY point with the person in question.\n'Nothing between us has occurred further than a school friendship at age 16. I would like to remove myself from the ongoing conversation & set the record straight for the sake of everyone involved.'\nKim had been at the centre of the row after Nicola claimed that she felt uncomfortable around her, with sources close to the US heiress saying that Kim had dated Brooklyn when they were teenagers. Which she had now denied.\nBrooklyn's birthday tribute to Harper marks his first public interaction with his family since he paid tribute to his grandmother Sandra on 26 June, despite remaining silent and shunning his father's 50th birthday earlier the same month.\nEarlier on Thursday, the family matriarch Victoria and her son Romeo were the first members of the Beckham family to share tributes to daughter Harper as she celebrated her 14th birthday while Brooklyn later followed suit.\nThe eldest son of Victoria and David Beckham and the actress paid tribute to Harper as she turned 14 on Thursday - in a surprise move amid speculation he wouldn't reach out to his sibling\nPrior to the fall-out, the family were pictured together in September at Victoria's Paris Fashion Week show, where the image in Brooklyn's birthday post was taken\nEarlier on Thursday, the family matriarch Victoria and her son Romeo were the first members of the Beckham family to share tributes to daughter Harper as she celebrated her 14th birthday while Brooklyn later followed suit\nThe post marks Brooklyn's first public interaction with his family since he paid tribute to his grandmother Sandra on 26 June, despite remaining silent and shunning his father's 50th birthday earlier the same month\nBrooklyn's post came shortly before David then wished Harper a happy birthday\nIn a statement to the alleged friction, Brooklyn and his wife Nicola - who shared the same post - left his parents out of the post, despite the image being taken at Victoria's Paris Fashion Week show in September.\nHarper's big day was at risk of widening the rift between David and Victoria and their eldest son, had he not reached out and put differences aside. His post came shortly before David then wished Harper a happy birthday.\nSources close to the family have told MailOnline of their fears that Brooklyn and his wife Nicola have also distanced themselves from Harper after they failed to visit her when they flew into London in May to film an advert for French-Italian clothing brand Moncler just over a mile from the family home in Holland Park.\nIn her own tribute to her daughter, fashion designer, 51, took to Instagram and shared several snaps of her youngest taken over the years, in a move which further showcased Brooklyn's absence following rumoured fall-out over his actress wife.\nAlongside the her post, Victoria wrote: 'Happy birthday to my world!! You are my everything and I\u2019m so proud of the strong, confident, kind and talented young lady you are becoming.\n'You\u2019re my best friend and I\u2019m so lucky I get to be your mummy. We love you so so much!! Enjoy your special day!! \u2764\ufe0f Kisses @davidbeckham xxx'.\nDavid and Victoria had no idea whether Brooklyn, who Harper has idolised since she was a little girl, would message her privately or publicly on Instagram because they have no communication with him.\nIt comes as tensions have continued to bubble in the past few weeks with a series of digs and jibes from camp Nicola and Brooklyn.\nRomeo was the first sibling to send his well wishes to Harper as he shared a photo of the pair at an event together\nJackie also shared a photo of her and Harper backstage at Victoria's Paris Fashion Week show in September last year\nCruz also shared a sweet snap with his sister to mark the day\nVictoria wrote: 'Happy birthday to my world!! You are my everything and I\u2019m so proud of the strong, confident, kind and talented young lady you are becoming'\nOn Wednesday aspiring chef Brooklyn shared a cooking video accompanied by a song which referred to not feeling like he has the confidence to speak up and finally feeling empowered - in a seemingly subtle but defiant message.\nAnd on the same day Nicola made a bizarre nod to father-in-law David as she sported a replica pair of the iconic football shorts he wore for his England debut in the 90s while out on her family's superyacht.\nShe was also keen to flaunt her close family bonds during the holiday to St Tropez as she shared gushing Instagram posts about her brothers on Monday.\nNicola continued to publicly praise and share admiration for her billionaire family on social media amid her husband's family feud.\nThe actress took to Instagram to share a series of photographs in which she gushed over her billionaire father Nelson Peltz and joked that her Labubu dolls were her family.\nThat came after she and Brooklyn shared photographs of themselves on social media attending Nelson's family birthday celebrations - painfully echoing the very similar celebrations they chose to snub for David's own recent birthday.\nAnd amid the escalating feud last week Romeo stepped in as he shared a very pointed statement about 'appreciating people that love you' and insisted 'life was too short' to not tell people you care about them.\nWhile Nicola revels in her happy life with her family, Brooklyn risks ruining his 'close bond' with sister Harper by overshadowing her birthday.\nSources close to the family have told MailOnline of their fears that Brooklyn and his wife Nicola have also ditched Harper\nShould Brooklyn not message, friends of the Beckhams predict that it will be a 'huge moment' in the feud, which escalated when the couple didn't attend any of David's 50th celebrations which took place between the end of March and the beginning of May.\nOne source said: 'Brooklyn and Harper used to be inseparable. He adored her, he hopefully still does, but the problem is that Brooklyn has a track record for ignoring family birthdays now.\n'It would be devastating for Harper not to hear from him. She hasn't done anything and she's only 13-years-old, she is the innocent party here.\n'Harper's birthday has always been such a happy day, she's the adored little daughter so it's always so joyous but this is a tough situation.\n'Brooklyn was 12 when Harper was born, he was so important in her life and it must be terribly sad that she isn't seeing him since the fall out with David and Victoria happened.\n'David and Victoria very much blame Nicola for all of this but hopefully Brooklyn will see sense.\n'While Harper doesn't have her own Instagram yet, the family thing is to tag her in on their posts as #harperseven.'\nAt the start of her relationship with Brooklyn, Nicola seemed to forge a strong bond with Harper. The actress soon positioned herself as a 'big sister' figure to the little girl, who is aid to have 'adored' her.\nBrooklyn, Harper and Nicola pictured in 2024\nIt comes as tensions have continued to bubble in the past few weeks with a series of digs and jibes from camp Nicola and Brooklyn\nBut now the couple, who married in April 2022 at her family's \u00a376million Florida mansion, no longer speak to Sir David and Lady Beckham, with the couple believing that she controls Brooklyn.\nPosh and Becks were furious when the couple didn't contact Harper when they visited London just weeks after David's birthday.\nAt the time they were also cross that they didn't get in touch with Cruz, 19, either because at that point he and Brooklyn had never had a crossed word.\nSince then the singer has very much come out on his parents' side amid the rift.\nDespite ignoring his father's birthday and his mum Victoria's two weeks before in April, Brooklyn did take to Instagram to wish the footballer's mum Sandra a happy birthday two weeks ago.\nHowever, Victoria was devastated when he didn't do the same for her father Tony back in May.\nLast week, Nicola addressed speculation that she was 'controlling' Brooklyn after posting snaps with her family and Brooklyn celebrating her father Nelson's 83rd birthday on the European getaway.\nThe celebratory photos were the latest blow for David and Victoria, after Brooklyn snubbed his own dad's 50th birthday - with many flooding the comment section to accuse Nicola of being to blame.\nYet she hit back by 'liking' a fan's comment that suggested Brooklyn had made his own decision.\nThe comment read: 'The fact people are in this comment section talking bs about someone controlling a GROWN man is absurd. The guy is an adult and can make his own decisions, leave them be and stop blaming women for everything.'\nAmid his escalating feud with his family, the pair failed to publicly acknowledge David's milestone 50th birthday on May 8.\nDavid and Victoria's 26th wedding anniversary also passed without mention, despite the former Manchester United and England footballer referencing Brooklyn in his own post.\nHe went on to tag his children including estranged son Brooklyn.\nVictoria, 51, also tagged her eldest son, captioning her post: 'Another year, another chapter in our love story.\n'I'm so proud of the beautiful family and life we've built together. You and our four incredible children complete me. I love you so much @davidbeckham. Here's to 26 years!!'\nDavid and Victoria seen with their children Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper last year before family feud\nAccording to sources, Nicola was like a 'big sister' to Harper (seen together) before falling out with her parents\nIt comes as on Wednesday Nicola made a bizarre nod to father-in-law David Beckham as she sported a pair of his football shorts while out on her family's superyacht\nOne source said: 'Brooklyn and Harper used to be inseparable. He adored her, he hopefully still does, but the problem is that Brooklyn has a track record for ignoring family birthdays now'\nThe actress also continued to publicly praise and share admiration for her billionaire family on social media amid her husband's family feud\nRumours of a rift between the eldest son and his parents began when Brooklyn was noticeably silent on his former Spice Girl mother's birthday, a far cry from his usual sweet posts about her.\nNeither the former photographer nor his wife wished Victoria a happy 51st, while David, Romeo and Cruz posted gushing messages.\nAnd as well as snubbing dad David's birthday online, he also was notably absent from all of his 50th birthday celebrations - including a boys' fishing trip.\nDespite flying to London at the time, Brooklyn and Nicola also didn't attend the big family party at the Beckhams' Cotswolds home or an idyllic trip to France or a meal at Notting Hill restaurant, Core.\nBrooklyn reportedly 'told his famous family that he wants no contact' with them last month in the latest devastating turn of their ongoing feud.\nAccording to reports, the eldest Beckham boy has had no communication with his family following father David's knighthood being announced last month and only learned of the news in the media alongside the rest of the world.\nDenying he'd asked for no contact, a source close to Brooklyn told the publication: 'Everyone's focus should be David Beckham's great honour'.Meanwhile a source close to Brooklyn also denied the claims as they told MailOnline, 'this seems to be another deliberate attempt to misrepresent the truth, and it only serves to distract from this honor being bestowed on Brooklyn's father.'"

Email tips@dailymail.com\nDavid and Romeo Beckham appeared tense as they watched Inter Miami play against Nashville SC at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on Saturday.\nThe outing comes just days after friends told MailOnline Cruz and Romeo blocked their brother Brooklyn and his wife Nicola Peltz on Instagram.\nDavid, 50, cut a dapper figure in a navy suit, teamed with a blue shirt and matching tie as he proudly watched his team.\nMeanwhile Romeo, 22, opted for a more casual but stylish look in a grey Snoop Dog T-shirt and green camouflage cargos, while accessorising with a flashy \u00a331k Rolex watch.\nAfter a tense match the pair would have been thrilled as they watched Lionel Messi score two goals, resulting in a 2-1 win against Nashville SC.\nThe team moved to fifth in the Supporters' Shield standings as it aims to win the title for the second straight season.\nDavid and Romeo Beckham appeared tense as they watched Inter Miami play against Nashville SC at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida on Saturday\nThe outing comes just days after friends told MailOnline Cruz and Romeo blocked their brother Brooklyn and his wife Nicola Peltz on Instagram\nIt comes after Romeo poured more fuel to the fire with a savage dig seemingly towards Brooklyn on Friday, hours after blocking Brooklyn and his wife.\nThe model, 22, posted a picture of Justin Bieber's new song Walking Away following his bombshell move.\nNot holding back with his feelings, Romeo commented 'Yup' - a particularly telling statement, given the family's explosive feud.\nCruz, 20, and Romeo were still following Brooklyn and Nicola on Friday but appeared to take action after Brooklyn posted a birthday tribute to sister Harper, sharing a family photo which excluded them and which Nicola reposted.\nBrooklyn, 26, and Nicola, 30, are still following his parents Victoria, 51, and David, 50.\nThere was much speculation whether Brooklyn would reach out to Harper on her birthday, but despite this it seems all is not well in the camp.\nThe news that Cruz and Romeo blocked their older sibling follows Cruz's many pointed digs towards Brooklyn on social media last month.\nMeanwhile, Brooklyn and Romeo have been living a somewhat fractious relationship over the last few months following claims Romeo's ex-girlfriend Kim Turnbull was the reason behind their rift.\nDavid, 50, cut a dapper figure in a navy suit, teamed with a blue shirt and matching tie as he proudly watched his team\nMeanwhile Romeo, 22, opted for a more casual look in a grey graphic T-shirt and green camouflage cargos, while accessorising with a flashy \u00a331k Rolex watch\nThe pair looked tense through out the match\nKim addressed the speculation June 16 and insisted she has only ever had a friendship with the eldest Beckham son.\nSharing a statement on her Instagram page, she said: 'I've avoided speaking on this topic to prevent adding fuel to the fire, however it's come to a point where I feel the need to address it so I can move on.\n'I will not continue to receive harassment or be embarrassed on the basis of lies, to fit a certain narrative.\n'I have never been romantically involved in ANY capacity at ANY point with the person in question.\n'Nothing between us has occurred further than a school friendship at age 16. I would like to remove myself from the ongoing conversation & set the record straight for the sake of everyone involved.'\nKim had been at the centre of the row after Nicola claimed that she felt uncomfortable around her, with sources close to the US heiress saying that Kim had dated Brooklyn when they were teenagers. Which she had now denied.\nBrooklyn's birthday tribute to Harper marks his first public interaction with his family since he paid tribute to his grandmother Sandra on 26 June, despite remaining silent and shunning his father's 50th birthday earlier the same month.\nEarlier on Thursday, the family matriarch Victoria and her son Romeo were the first members of the Beckham family to share tributes to daughter Harper as she celebrated her 14th birthday while Brooklyn later followed suit.\nThe model posted a picture of Justin Bieber's new song Walking Away following his bombshell move, alongside the caption 'Yup'\nBrooklyn's friends claimed to MailOnline on Friday that Cruz and Romeo have actually blocked them on the social media channel (pictured together in 2023)\nAnd this would make sense as Brooklyn and Nicola are still following his parents Victoria and David\nCruz and Romeo were still following Brooklyn and Nicola on Friday but appeared to take action after Brooklyn posted a birthday tribute to sister Harper, sharing a family photo which excluded them and which Nicola reposted\nIn a statement to the alleged friction, Brooklyn and his wife Nicola - who shared the same post - left his parents out of the post, despite the image being taken at Victoria's Paris Fashion Week show in September.\nHarper's big day was at risk of widening the rift between David and Victoria and their eldest son, had he not reached out and put differences aside. His post came shortly before David then wished Harper a happy birthday.\nSources close to the family have told MailOnline of their fears that Brooklyn and his wife Nicola have also distanced themselves from Harper after they failed to visit her when they flew into London in May to film an advert for French-Italian clothing brand Moncler just over a mile from the family home in Holland Park.\nIn her own tribute to her daughter, fashion designer, 51, took to Instagram and shared several snaps of her youngest taken over the years, in a move which further showcased Brooklyn's absence following rumoured fall-out over his actress wife.\nAlongside the her post, Victoria wrote: 'Happy birthday to my world!! You are my everything and I\u2019m so proud of the strong, confident, kind and talented young lady you are becoming.\n'You\u2019re my best friend and I\u2019m so lucky I get to be your mummy. We love you so so much!! Enjoy your special day!! \u2764\ufe0f Kisses @davidbeckham xxx'.\nDavid and Victoria had no idea whether Brooklyn, who Harper has idolised since she was a little girl, would message her privately or publicly on Instagram because they have no communication with him.\nIt comes as tensions have continued to bubble in the past few weeks with a series of digs and jibes from camp Nicola and Brooklyn.\nThe eldest son of Victoria and David Beckham and the actress paid tribute to Harper as she turned 14 on Thursday - in a surprise move amid speculation he wouldn't reach out to his sibling\nPrior to the fall-out, the family were pictured together in September at Victoria's Paris Fashion Week show, where the image in Brooklyn's birthday post was taken\nEarlier on Thursday, the family matriarch Victoria and her son Romeo were the first members of the Beckham family to share tributes to daughter Harper as she celebrated her 14th birthday while Brooklyn later followed suit\nThe post marks Brooklyn's first public interaction with his family since he paid tribute to his grandmother Sandra on 26 June, despite remaining silent and shunning his father's 50th birthday earlier the same month\nBrooklyn's post came shortly before David then wished Harper a happy birthday\nOn Wednesday aspiring chef Brooklyn shared a cooking video accompanied by a song which referred to not feeling like he has the confidence to speak up and finally feeling empowered - in a seemingly subtle but defiant message.\nAnd on the same day Nicola made a bizarre nod to father-in-law David as she sported a replica pair of the iconic football shorts he wore for his England debut in the 90s while out on her family's superyacht.\nShe was also keen to flaunt her close family bonds during the holiday to St Tropez as she shared gushing Instagram posts about her brothers on Monday.\nNicola continued to publicly praise and share admiration for her billionaire family on social media amid her husband's family feud.\nThe actress took to Instagram to share a series of photographs in which she gushed over her billionaire father Nelson Peltz and joked that her Labubu dolls were her family.\nThat came after she and Brooklyn shared photographs of themselves on social media attending Nelson's family birthday celebrations - painfully echoing the very similar celebrations they chose to snub for David's own recent birthday.\nAnd amid the escalating feud last week Romeo stepped in as he shared a very pointed statement about 'appreciating people that love you' and insisted 'life was too short' to not tell people you care about them.\nWhile Nicola revels in her happy life with her family, Brooklyn risks ruining his 'close bond' with sister Harper by overshadowing her birthday.\nShould Brooklyn not message, friends of the Beckhams predict that it will be a 'huge moment' in the feud, which escalated when the couple didn't attend any of David's 50th celebrations which took place between the end of March and the beginning of May.\nRomeo was the first sibling to send his well wishes to Harper as he shared a photo of the pair at an event together\nJackie also shared a photo of her and Harper backstage at Victoria's Paris Fashion Week show in September last year\nCruz also shared a sweet snap with his sister to mark the day\nVictoria wrote: 'Happy birthday to my world!! You are my everything and I\u2019m so proud of the strong, confident, kind and talented young lady you are becoming'\nOne source said: 'Brooklyn and Harper used to be inseparable. He adored her, he hopefully still does, but the problem is that Brooklyn has a track record for ignoring family birthdays now.\n'It would be devastating for Harper not to hear from him. She hasn't done anything and she's only 13-years-old, she is the innocent party here.\n'Harper's birthday has always been such a happy day, she's the adored little daughter so it's always so joyous but this is a tough situation.\n'Brooklyn was 12 when Harper was born, he was so important in her life and it must be terribly sad that she isn't seeing him since the fall out with David and Victoria happened.\n'David and Victoria very much blame Nicola for all of this but hopefully Brooklyn will see sense.\n'While Harper doesn't have her own Instagram yet, the family thing is to tag her in on their posts as #harperseven.'\nAt the start of her relationship with Brooklyn, Nicola seemed to forge a strong bond with Harper. The actress soon positioned herself as a 'big sister' figure to the little girl, who is aid to have 'adored' her.\nBut now the couple, who married in April 2022 at her family's \u00a376million Florida mansion, no longer speak to Sir David and Lady Beckham, with the couple believing that she controls Brooklyn.\nPosh and Becks were furious when the couple didn't contact Harper when they visited London just weeks after David's birthday.\nSources close to the family have told MailOnline of their fears that Brooklyn and his wife Nicola have also ditched Harper\nIt comes as tensions have continued to bubble in the past few weeks with a series of digs and jibes from camp Nicola and Brooklyn\nAt the time they were also cross that they didn't get in touch with Cruz, 19, either because at that point he and Brooklyn had never had a crossed word.\nSince then the singer has very much come out on his parents' side amid the rift.\nDespite ignoring his father's birthday and his mum Victoria's two weeks before in April, Brooklyn did take to Instagram to wish the footballer's mum Sandra a happy birthday two weeks ago.\nHowever, Victoria was devastated when he didn't do the same for her father Tony back in May.\nLast week, Nicola addressed speculation that she was 'controlling' Brooklyn after posting snaps with her family and Brooklyn celebrating her father Nelson's 83rd birthday on the European getaway.\nThe celebratory photos were the latest blow for David and Victoria, after Brooklyn snubbed his own dad's 50th birthday - with many flooding the comment section to accuse Nicola of being to blame.\nYet she hit back by 'liking' a fan's comment that suggested Brooklyn had made his own decision.\nThe comment read: 'The fact people are in this comment section talking bs about someone controlling a GROWN man is absurd. The guy is an adult and can make his own decisions, leave them be and stop blaming women for everything.'\nAmid his escalating feud with his family, the pair failed to publicly acknowledge David's milestone 50th birthday on May 8.\nDavid and Victoria's 26th wedding anniversary also passed without mention, despite the former Manchester United and England footballer referencing Brooklyn in his own post.\nHe went on to tag his children including estranged son Brooklyn.\nDavid and Victoria seen with their children Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper last year before family feud\nIt comes as on Wednesday Nicola made a bizarre nod to father-in-law David Beckham as she sported a pair of his football shorts while out on her family's superyacht\nVictoria, 51, also tagged her eldest son, captioning her post: 'Another year, another chapter in our love story.\n'I'm so proud of the beautiful family and life we've built together. You and our four incredible children complete me. I love you so much @davidbeckham. Here's to 26 years!!'\nRumours of a rift between the eldest son and his parents began when Brooklyn was noticeably silent on his former Spice Girl mother's birthday, a far cry from his usual sweet posts about her.\nNeither the former photographer nor his wife wished Victoria a happy 51st, while David, Romeo and Cruz posted gushing messages.\nAnd as well as snubbing dad David's birthday online, he also was notably absent from all of his 50th birthday celebrations - including a boys' fishing trip.\nDespite flying to London at the time, Brooklyn and Nicola also didn't attend the big family party at the Beckhams' Cotswolds home or an idyllic trip to France or a meal at Notting Hill restaurant, Core.\nBrooklyn reportedly 'told his famous family that he wants no contact' with them last month in the latest devastating turn of their ongoing feud.\nAccording to reports, the eldest Beckham boy has had no communication with his family following father David's knighthood being announced last month and only learned of the news in the media alongside the rest of the world.\nDenying he'd asked for no contact, a source close to Brooklyn told the publication: 'Everyone's focus should be David Beckham 's great honour'.Meanwhile a source close to Brooklyn also denied the claims as they told MailOnline, 'this seems to be another deliberate attempt to misrepresent the truth, and it only serves to distract from this honor being bestowed on Brooklyn's father.'"

The plan was shot down in a call between Victoria and Nicola's mom.\nIn a bombshell interview with Grazia USA, the 27-year-old revealed: 'We connected to start designing the dress, and then a few days went by and I didn\u2019t hear anything. Victoria called my mom and said her atelier couldn\u2019t make it.'\nDoting husband Brooklyn made his position clear amid the family feud, telling the publication that Nicola is his 'number one priority' and that they 'have each other's back 100 per cent'.\nNewlywed Nicola Peltz, 27, has sensationally claimed that she was blanked by her mother-in-law Victoria Beckham after the designer offered to make her a wedding dress - adding that the former Spice Girl then backtracked on her offer and said that her atelier actually couldn't complete the gown\nIn a bombshell interview with Grazia USA , the 27-year-old revealed: 'We connected to start designing the dress, and then a few days went by and I didn\u2019t hear anything. Victoria called my mom and said her atelier couldn\u2019t make it'\nMillionaire heiress Nicola ended up sporting a stunning couture Valentino number at her wedding. She tied the knot with her sweetheart Brooklyn Beckham, son of Victoria and David Beckham, at her family's estate in Palm Beach, Florida, in April\nFAMILY RIFT: The pair have reportedly been embroiled in a family feud after the heiress sported a couture Valentino wedding dress to tie the knot to Victoria's eldest son Brooklyn earlier this year - rather than a design by his mother (Victoria, David, Nicola and Brooklyn pictured together in 2021)\nDescribing Victoria and David as 'great in-laws', Nicola admitted that it 'hurt my feelings' when it was reported that she 'never planned' to wear a dress by her mother-in-law\nThe Grazia interview is the latest - and clearest - sign that tensions between Nicola and Victoria are at an all-time high\nNicola, the daughter of New York billionaire Nelson Peltz, attempted to set the record straight as she explained: 'I was planning on wearing Victoria\u2019s wedding dress and I was truly so excited to be able to wear a design that my future mother-in-law created.\n'I thought that was so beautiful and such a beautiful story.'\nThe Grazia interview will likely do little to quell any rift between Nicola and her mother-in-law\nFollowing the revelations from Victoria that she couldn't make her daughter-in-law's dress, Nicola recalled: 'So, I spoke to my mom and Leslie, and I was like, \"Well, unfortunately, this can\u2019t happen, so what\u2019s the next step?\"\n'I\u2019ve been a fan of Valentino and their couture for so long. I was really lucky to be able to travel to [the atelier] to try on the dress. That\u2019s really what happened.'\nThe wedding dress drama was bolstered by the fact that Victoria not only wore her own dress design on the day - but four of her dearest friends and her own mother attended the nuptials wearing her designs.\nEva Longoria, Nadia Ferreria, Zanna Roberts Rassi, and Romeo's then-girlfriend Mia Regan all wore gorgeous VB gowns to Brooklyn and Nicola's big day.\nDescribing Victoria and David as 'great in-laws', Nicola admitted that it 'hurt her feelings' when it was reported that she had 'never planned' to wear a dress by her mother-in-law.\nThe 27-year-old said: 'It does hurt my feelings. I try not to let it, but it\u2019s just not the truth. It\u2019s just a bit of a bummer when you\u2019re like, \"Oh, people think that,\" but it\u2019s just not true.'\nBrooklyn - who was always known to have had a close relationship with his parents and siblings in the past - made his position on the rift perfectly clear when he stated that his wife is his 'first priority', before adding that they always 'talk things through' and 'move on together' when it comes to rumors and speculation about their personal lives.\n'To be honest, my wife is obviously my first priority and I never want to see her upset ever,' he said. 'We have each other\u2019s back 100 per cent and we just move on together.'\nLovebirds Nicola and Brooklyn tied the knot at a no-expense-spared ceremony earlier this year, which was held at the heiress' lavish family estate in Palm Beach, Florida.\nBefore rumors of the feud emerged, Nicola told her followers on social media that Victoria was her 'role model' in a heartfelt post for her birthday in 2021. Things have since soured, according to insiders and eagle-eyed fans\nPrioritizing: And backing his wife, Brooklyn chimed in and explained that they 'talk things through' when rumors circulate, adding: 'To be honest, my wife is obviously my first priority and I never want to see her upset ever'\nThe wedding dress drama was bolstered by the fact that Victoria not only wore her own dress design on the day - but four of her dearest friends and her own mother attended the nuptials wearing VB designs\nSetting the record straight: 'We connected to start designing the dress, and then a few days went by and I didn\u2019t hear anything. Victoria called my mom and said her atelier couldn\u2019t make it,' explained Nicola\nBefore the wedding in April 2022, Victoria and Nicola were plastered over each other's social media, supporting each other through likes and comments. But fans noticed that the once-active online relationship slowly disappeared in the months following the nuptials\nInitially, Nicola and Victoria appeared to enjoy a close-knit relationship, with the pair regularly sharing selfies and family photos on their respective social media accounts. In 2021, Nicola even described her then-future-mother-in-law as her 'role model' while posting a gushing birthday tribute to the designer.\nBut eagle-eyed fans started to speculate that tensions had arisen between Victoria and Nicola after they went months without engaging online - before a series of cryptic interviews and Instagram posts further fueled the rumors about a rift between the two women.\nNicola appears on the front cover of the latest issue of Grazia, in which she hit back at claims that she had 'never planned' to wear a wedding dress designed by Victoria - insisting that it was actually her mother-in-law who put an end to her desire to sport one of her gowns\nIn August, Nicola shared a candid snap of herself looking sad with red watery eyes, with the beauty confessing she 'finds it hard to show the sad bits of me' while praising the way her 'strong parents' brought her up.\nMany believed this was a snub towards Victoria, as she made reference to her loving family teaching her not to allow other people to 'bring her down'.\nFans also questioned Victoria's rather emotionless celebratory Instagram post following the wedding - as she just wrote: 'Congratulations Mr and Mrs Beckham. Welcome to the family x.'\nMany were quick to notice Victoria didn't use Brooklyn and Nicola's official new join surname - Peltz-Beckham - causing further speculation that the post was in fact a thinly-veiled hint about their growing tensions.\nOther clues about the cold war between the Beckham women include when Nicola failed to post an image with Victoria at the glamorous wedding reception - despite her caption being 'family is everything to me.'\nSince then, Nicola and Victoria have scarcely liked each other's pictures on social media, despite the fact that they used to always show support for one another online.\nIt was also reported that the Beckhams were not happy after Nicola posed for a glitzy front cover close-up for British socialite magazine Tatler - published with the in-your-face headline 'The new Mrs Beckham.'\nMrs. Beckham is a title that Victoria has, of course, worn with pride since she wed her soccer player beau back in July 1999.\nBrooklyn posted the stunning front cover of his adoring wife, with the caption: 'Wow. I am so proud of you baby. You look absolutely gorgeous and I am so in love with you. Congratulations babe.'\nThe Instagram post was not liked by his mother, Victoria.\nBrooklyn Peltz Beckham and his wife Nicola kiss lovingly as they leave Club 55 in Saint-Tropez on July 13, 2022\nThe loved-up couple pose for pictures on the red carpet at the Met Gala in May 2022\nNicola's front cover interview for British magazine Tatler is said to have turned heads in the Beckham household. Mrs Beckham is of course the name Victoria has worn with pride since she wed soccer star Becks in July 1999\nFamily: Brooklyn is the eldest of Victoria and David's brood, with the long-standing couple also sharing 20-year-old Romeo, Cruz, 17 and Harper Seven, 11\nKeeping quiet: David and Victoria (seen left in the 90s before they married and right in 2019) have stayed silent on the matter, as rumors circulate of the rift\nBefore the wedding, Nicola and Brooklyn's younger sister Harper shared a loving relationship online - however the bond between the sisters has scarcely been seen in the public eye since the feuds with Victoria\nIn the accompanying interview, Nicola made what several fans believed to be sly digs at her new in-laws - and the way that they had treated her husband in the past.\nShe told the magazine: 'Brooklyn felt a lot of pressure to please people with his career and he didn\u2019t love it.\u2019\nAnd Nicola also said that Brooklyn often turns to her 80-year-old father, Nelson, for business advice - rather than going to his singer, fashion designer, multi-million pound business owner mother, or his legendary former soccer star father.\nShe said: 'Brooklyn is getting into very exciting things with his shows and also business things and it\u2019s really sweet. I watch him call my dad and say, \u201cWhat do you think about this?\u201d I love watching him learn from my dad.\u2019\nBrooklyn is the eldest of Victoria and soccer player David's brood, with the long-standing couple also sharing 20-year-old Romeo, Cruz, 17 and Harper Seven, 11.\nThe family of six are famously very close knit, with Victoria and her photographer-turned-chef son historically sharing a close relationship.\nBut with reports of a rift between Nicola and Victoria reportedly driving a wedge between the Beckham's and their eldest son - the wedding dress fiasco appears to have only been the beginning.\nNicola was allegedly offended when David and Victoria's close friend Marc Anthony gave a gushing speech at her wedding \u2013 all about Victoria, according to one insider.\n'It was totally just an ode to Victoria and how awesome she is. Nicola loves to be the center of attention, especially on her wedding day. So this really, really p***ed her off,' the source said.\n'She stormed off in the middle of her wedding reception with [sister] Brittany and her mom, and was crying her eyes out.'\nAnother source agreed Nicola was upset during the reception \u2013 but said it wasn't because Anthony was gushing about Victoria.\nBrooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz tied the knot in April 2022, and they both formally changed their names to Peltz-Beckham to signify their union.

      "text": "Brooklyn and Nicola's wedding secrets revealed: Couple take part in last interview before exchanging vows and discuss their fears for the first dance, speech nerves and the groom's constant jealousy\nBrooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz are walking down the aisle in Palm Beach this weekend. And ahead of their lavish $4 million (\u00a33million) nuptials, the smitten couple have taken part in a very revealing, Mr. and Mrs. game for British Vogue. [RELATED: The soon-to-be married couple's ironclad prenup.]\nIn a video shared by the publication on Wednesday, the British amateur chef went head-to-head with his US actress fianc\u00e9e, revealing all about their honeymoon plans, their wedding nerves and a cringeworthy family secret. The couple teased their wedding plans in the fun game, which saw them attempt to guess which answer their other half would write down in response to a series of probing questions.\nAhead of their lavish nuptials at Nicola's $76 million family home in Florida, the pair admitted that they both have some last minute nerves - but are scared of different parts of the celeb-packed ceremony. After Nicole wrote down that she thought Brooklyn would be most scared of the first dance, he told her: 'I'm great at dancing, I'm not worried about that,' as he revealed his answer to be his wedding speech. 'I'm terrified about the first dance, I can't dance,' Nicola confessed, only for Brooklyn to pull a face and insist: 'I'm gonna kill that.'\nThe loved-up couple matched answers on the question of what they're most looking forward to about the wedding, sweetly answering 'marrying you,' and both thought 'sensitive' Brooklyn would be the most likely to cry on the big day. Brooklyn also guessed that his bride-to-be would love a honeymoon in the South of France, writing down that he thinks she would love to honeymoon with the whole family and drink Lychee Martinis day and night, with Nicola declaring 'he deserves that point'.\nThe most awkward moment came when Nicola was asked to guess what her beau's most embarrassing memory was. The blonde had to double check that Brooklyn was OK with her writing it down, admitting 'I know what the answer is!' Confident Brooklyn insists he didn't care before both revealed their answer to be 'he popped in class.' The son of David and Victoria Brooklyn explained: 'I grew up saying popped instead of fart... I was in library and I had to read out loud and I popped and it echoed throughout the whole class.' Brooklyn then laughed and told the camera 'I'm sweating,' before his supportive fianc\u00e9e exclaimed: 'You? I'm sweating, look at my face!' Another telling moment came when Nicola was asked when was the last time Brooklyn was jealous?' Nicola immediately wrote down 'yesterday' while Brooklyn answered 'one hour ago!' 'It is what it is, you get jealous, it means that you love her.'\nWhile the couple of three years failed to match on all their answers, Brooklyn did manage to guess his gorgeous girlfriend's dream date is a PJ night with face masks and their joint favorite TV show - Gilmore Girls. Nicola, though, doesn't know what her chef fianc\u00e9's favorite meal is, answering 'British classic bangers and mash and fries'. Brooklyn, though, insisted that he loves tucking into pie and mash, a pint of prawns and a certain iconic Brit dessert. 'Ew, if we went on a date and ordered that I'm sorry no,' grimaces Nicola. 'That is never happening!' In the end, Brooklyn is declared the winner with a 4-2 score, much to Nicola's annoyance. 'No that's fake!' she insists, before her beau points out: 'I said I popped in front of the whole world, I bloody deserve to win don't I?'\nThe smitten pair will wed this weekend at the Peltz family's 44,000-sq-ft oceanfront house, with no expense spared for the couple's big day. Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, actress Eva Longoria and former footballer Phil Neville are all expected to be in attendance. Victoria's Spice Girls bandmate Melanie Brown - Mel B - has confirmed she is attending the ceremony, which has been described by friends as 'Miami society meets British celebrity'.\nBrooklyn's godfather Sir Elton John will be absent due to the rescheduling of his Yellow Brick Road tour, but the aspiring chef's other godfather, Dave Gardner, will be there. There have also been reports that American football legend Tom Brady will be among the guests, possibly with his wife, supermodel Gisele B\u00fcndchen, but speculation that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex could attend are wide of the mark.\nBrooklyn's younger brothers, Romeo and Cruz, will be best men, while Harper will be a bridesmaid. Nicola's maternal grandmother will be her maid of honor. Brooklyn's father, David, has no formal role, but friends say he has been tasked with ensuring that all the Beckham men look their best. Brooklyn is understood to have signed a prenuptial agreement with his heiress bride-to-be Nicola. The \u00a3380million ($496 million) fortune of Brooklyn's parents is dwarfed by the estimated \u00a31.3billion ($1.7 billion) wealth of Miss Peltz's financier father, Nelson."

      "text": "The REAL reason the Beckhams feel they're being frozen out of their son's life: As Brooklyn spends the summer with his new wife and billionaire in-laws, but not his own parents, ALISON BOSHOFF lifts the lid on the family tensions\n- Speculation about the potentially frosty relationship between Victoria Beckham and her new daughter-in-law Nicola Peltz have been swirling around for months\n- Son Brooklyn and his wife invited to Beckham's Paris Fashion Week this month\n- Rumours of poor relations fuelled by newlyweds snubbing trip with Beckhams\n- ALISON BOSHOFF reveals the real reason Beckhams are feeling a little left out\nAs olive branches go, it\u2019s very Victoria Beckham. After months of speculation about frosty relations with her son Brooklyn\u2019s new in-laws, he and his wife Nicola have been invited to Victoria\u2019s Paris Fashion Week show at the end of the month.\n\u2018Everyone is invited, including Brooklyn and Nicola,\u2019 I\u2019m told. \u2018Although it\u2019s not definite yet that they will come.\u2019\nAll concerned are hoping the newlyweds will attend and that the families will be reunited \u2014 not least because the fall-out between them has caused the Beckhams a great deal of pain.\nAs first revealed in this paper, an icy silence has descended between Nicola and her mother-in-law Victoria.\nEveryone has been invited to the Fashion Week in Paris including the newlyweds (pictured)\nStarting from the wedding in April, the pair have pointedly failed to like each other\u2019s posts on social media. They have spent time together only once, on a night out in Italy in July.\nBrooklyn and Nicola enjoyed weeks on holiday with the Peltz family on their yacht this summer \u2014 and skipped the Beckhams\u2019 yacht holiday completely. They then spent more time with the Peltzes in Florida.\nSince then, there has been a volley of accusations, with claims that Victoria hijacked the bride and groom\u2019s wedding dance and that Nicola had no intention of wearing a dress by Victoria as, woundingly, she knew designers who were \u2018actually talented\u2019.\nThese tensions, which came to a head during the wedding, remain high. On one side, you have besotted Brooklyn, who has an enormous \u2018Peltz\u2019 tattoo across his chest and keeps adding more inky tributes to his wife \u2014 apparently each one makes her weep because she is so in love with him.\nOn the other, you have the Beckhams, who feel their son has been completely absorbed by his wife\u2019s large, wealthy family.\nNelson Peltz, a feared corporate raider whose firm is the largest shareholder in the Wendy\u2019s burger chain, is said to be bringing Brooklyn even further into the fold by financially backing his forthcoming commercial venture into the hot chilli sauce business.\nAll concerned are hoping the newlyweds will attend and that the families will be reunited\nTo Nicola\u2019s delight, aspiring chef Brooklyn defers to Nelson (quite sensibly) for career advice.\nShe told Tatler this summer: \u2018Brooklyn is getting into very exciting things with his shows and also business things and it\u2019s really sweet. I watch him call my dad and say: \u201cWhat do you think about this?\u201d I love watching him learn from my dad.\u2019\nA Beckham source says: \u2018The Peltz family can offer him things which they [the Beckhams] cannot in terms of commercial connections. David and Victoria have been deeply upset by how things have played out.\n\u2018They are worried that Nicola is going to hurt Brooklyn. They feel that the relationship is unbalanced. He makes a lot of sacrifices for her but it\u2019s not clear what happens in return. But you know, as Victoria says: \u201cHe\u2019s just gaga about that girl.\u201d \u2019\nThe former Spice Girl may have risen to fame with the mantra Girl Power, but it seems this is one situation which she has no power to fix \u2014 at least not by wading in and opening her mouth.\n\u2018It\u2019s a waiting game,\u2019 says the source. \u2018She is doing nothing about it \u2014 she would be stupid to even try.\u2019\nHow different the picture was when Brooklyn and Nicola started dating at the end of 2019.\nFrom the start, David and Victoria thoroughly approved of Nicola, the savvy youngest child of a billionaire family (Nelson is worth \u00a31.3 billion).\nThe couple have reportedly spent more time with the Peltzes in Florida over the summer on their estate\nAt the outset, Nicola had said that she wanted her mum Claudia (pictured together) to be her wedding planner\nShe was a guest of honour at Brooklyn\u2019s 21st birthday party in March 2020, dancing the night away with Victoria, who wrote of Nicola on Instagram: \u2018We love you so much!\u2019\nNicola, four years older than Brooklyn, had already found a career while he was struggling to make it as a photographer and model, having already decided against following his father into football. By contrast, Nicola had tasted some success, starring in Transformers: Age Of Extinction, and was a steadier influence than some of his previous romances (his liaison with model Hana Cross was very stormy.)\nThe couple became engaged in July 2020, just as the first pandemic lockdown in the UK was lifting.\nNicola posed for pictures in a canary yellow Victoria Beckham dress and Victoria penned a gushing welcome on Instagram \u2018The MOST exciting news!! We could not be happier. Wishing you so much love and a lifetime of happiness. We all love you both so much x.\u2019\nBut I\u2019m told by a well-placed friend that the cracks started to appear soon afterwards, when the Beckhams were invited to meet Nelson and Claudia Peltz at their \u00a376 million home in Palm Beach, Florida. In normal circumstances, this would have happened before the engagement \u2014 but the pandemic meant that it didn\u2019t.\nThe source says: \u2018When they first went to the Peltz house, the Beckhams sent their security team in advance to sweep the place.\n\u2018It is standard procedure when you are a couple at this level of fame, but it did not go down well with the Peltz family. They have their own security, of course, and naturally it is the best that money can buy, so there was no need for their visitors to do this. It raised eyebrows. The feeling was that the Beckhams were somehow saying that they were more important than the Peltzes. It was a simple mis-step, but a bad start.\u2019\nThoughts then turned to wedding planning.\nThe Beckhams were interested in having weddings on both sides of the Atlantic, with a celebration at their house in the Cotswolds \u2014as they did for Brooklyn\u2019s 21st \u2014 plus one in America.\nThe Peltzes, as is traditional, wanted to have just one wedding at their immense house in Florida, complete with its own jetty and beach.\nClaudia Heffner Peltz, a titanium socialite and former top model, firmly took charge, and made a number of decisions \u2014 including that there would just be one wedding. She\u2019s had years of experience hosting mega-budget parties and charity events \u2014 a bar mitzvah she threw for her twin sons at the St Regis in New York is said to have cost \u00a32 million.\nAt the outset, Nicola had said that she wanted her mum to be her wedding planner, recalling in an interview with Wonderland magazine this week: \u2018My mom was such a big help in my wedding.\u2019\nThe newlyweds skipped a holiday with in-laws Victoria and David Beckham (pictured) over the summer\nOne of the first and biggest questions was who would design the dress. As Nicola has said, Victoria Beckham had offered to do the honours.\nRecollections vary about what happened next. Nicola said that it became clear that what she wanted was beyond what her mother-in-law\u2019s atelier was able to deliver. Some other sources think that Nicola was never really serious about taking Victoria up on the offer.\nIt would be no surprise if Nicola, a full-on fashionista, had had her heart set on the couture experience for this, the biggest dress of her life.\nBy September 2021, she was visiting Pierpaolo Piccioli at Valentino in Rome with her mother Claudia and her stylist in attendance, being fitted for her dream dress. At this point, there was an assumption by many of Victoria\u2019s friends that one of the bride\u2019s other outfits would be by Victoria, who is known for her tailored trouser suits.\nBut while Nicola did wear a trouser suit on the eve of her wedding, it was not a Victoria Beckham creation, but one by Dior.\nNor did Victoria get a look in at the post-wedding party, when Nicola opted to wear a Versace mini-dress.\nTo make matters worse, Nicola spoke in flattering terms about both designers to Vogue magazine, failing to mention at any point in the interview that her future mother-in-law was a successful designer herself.\nAs for the mother of the bride, Claudia Peltz wore Versace throughout.\nBrooklyn and Nicola enjoyed weeks on holiday with the Peltz family on their yacht this summer\nThe couple became engaged in July 2020, just as the first pandemic lockdown in the UK was lifting\nPerhaps no slight was intended, but the publicity felt like rather a slap around the face for Mrs Beckham.\nI\u2019m told: \u2018This all started because Claudia was in the driving seat over the wedding and it put Victoria into a rage.\n\u2018Victoria is used to people being intimidated by her, she\u2019s been famous for 25 years and is deferred to a lot, but Mrs Peltz didn\u2019t seem to be impressed in the slightest.\u2019\nAnother apparent source of tension was Victoria\u2019s habit of posting online pictures of herself cosied up to her future daughter-in-law.\nClaudia\u2019s view, apparently, was that it was time for this overly clingy and interfering mother to fade into the background and let her girl shine.\nIn the end, Victoria\u2019s only input into the wedding seems to have been that the guests should be offered a \u2018light\u2019 menu option.\nThe Beckhams also chose their friend, DJ Fat Tony, to provide a set at the wedding, and are thought to have paid for both this and a performance by the singer Marc Anthony, who is also a pal.\nIn addition, the Beckhams were absent from the top table. It caused some confusion as at an English wedding the top table would include both the bride and groom\u2019s parents \u2014 but at this American wedding the Beckhams hosted their own table of friends.\nThe Beckhams were absent from the top table at the lavish wedding earlier this year, where they instead hosted their own table of friends\n\u2018Victoria would have liked to have been on the top table,\u2019 I\u2019m told.\nThe day itself went off well enough. Reports suggesting that Victoria stole the first dance from the bride are inaccurate, as are reports that singer Marc Anthony upset Nicola by giving a long speech about Mrs Beckham.\nBut the damage had been done, with the Beckhams feeling puzzled that they had been seemingly sidelined from the life of their adored eldest son.\nThere are also suggestions that the Peltz family are rather surprised that Brooklyn hasn\u2019t had more of an education. He dropped out of his university course in photography at the prestigious Parsons School of Design in New York after only a year.\nI\u2019m told: \u2018A level of mistrust exists which means that each side suspects, wrongly, that the other has been leaking stories in recent weeks.\n\u2018The Beckhams are both really hurt, particularly David. They want to be there for Brooklyn, they always thought he would be a big part of their lives for ever. Now they don\u2019t even speak as often as they would like. It has come as a real shock.\n\u2018The only plus is that problems have brought Victoria and David closer together. They discuss it endlessly. They know that Brooklyn is madly in love with Nicola and you can\u2019t fight that.\n\u2018Nobody can talk any sense into him. He\u2019s spending all his time with her family \u2014 it\u2019s all Peltz, Peltz Peltz.\u2019\nIndeed, Brooklyn continues to gush over Nicola on Instagram. \u2018Words can\u2019t describe how proud I am of you,\u2019 he writes. \u2018I love you so much.\u2019\nOccasionally, though, he cooks. On August 19 he shared footage of himself making a \u2018spicy chicken parm\u2019. His father wrote: \u2018When u gonna make us one?\u2019\nWhen indeed?\nMost watched News videos\n- Moment passengers 'stop' man who pulled down trousers on tube\n- Moment Cycling Mikey pushes bike into a car after furious row\n- Shocking moment man is gored to death after charging at bull\n- Shocking moment woman strikes flight attendant before being removed\n- Kristen Welker calls out JB Pritzker over Gerrymandering\n- Family-friendly restaurant Cracker Barrel unveils bold new look\n- Chinese navy vessel collides with one of its own chasing Philippine boat\n- Chinese Navy ship collides with own vessel while chasing boat\n- Florida man knocks out kayakers while attempting a DAREDEVIL leap\n- Hawaii ferry is tossed by strong waves before being run aground\n- Father of children mowed down in Oatlands tragedy confronts killer\n- Jennifer Lopez has an unexpected guest during her concert"

  "argos_summary": "David and Victoria Beckham are reportedly heartbroken over their son Brooklyn's estrangement from the family, particularly after he failed to invite them to his recent vow renewal ceremony with Nicola Peltz. The couple, who first married in 2022, renewed their vows in a private ceremony officiated by Nicola's father, with no Beckham family members present. This estrangement has been exacerbated by Brooklyn's lack of communication with his parents and siblings, leading to concerns that he has 'quit the family' amid ongoing tensions.",
