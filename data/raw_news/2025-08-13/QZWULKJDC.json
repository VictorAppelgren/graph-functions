  "description": "The 133-year-old camera photography company warned investors it has \"substantial doubt\" over its future.",
  "content": "The iconic photography company Kodak could go out of business within a year. The 133-year-old American company warned investors Monday in a regulatory filing that there\u2019s \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d it can keep its doors open unless it pays down its debts or renegotiates its terms.\n\nIn the filing, Kodak warned it has \u201cdebt coming due within twelve months and does not have committed financing or available liquidity to meet such debt obligations if they were to become due in accordance with their current terms.\u201d The company added that these conditions \u201craise substantial doubt about Kodak\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\u201d\n\nAlthough Kodak introduced the world\u2019s first digital camera back in 1973, the company failed to keep up with the changing times, as everyone now carries a camera in their pocket 24/7, making standalone cameras and film less relevant for most people.\n\n\u201cIn the second quarter, Kodak continued to make progress against our long-term plan despite the challenges of an uncertain business environment,\u201d Kodak CEO Jim Continenza said Monday in the company\u2019s second quarterly earnings report.\n\nIn its latest quarter, Kodak reported a $26 million net loss. Since the end of last year, the company has burned through $46 million in cash, leaving it with just $155 million on hand. Meanwhile, Kodak is carrying roughly $500 million in debt.\n\nKodak did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Gizmodo. However, a company spokesperson told CNN on Tuesday that it is \u201cconfident it will be able to pay off a significant portion of its term loan well before it becomes due, and amend, extend, or refinance our remaining debt and/or preferred stock obligations.\u201d\n\nKodak said last year it would end its pension plan to help reduce its debt.\n\n\u201cThe termination of our U.S. Kodak Retirement Income Plan and subsequent reversion of excess funds to pay down debt is progressing as planned,\u201d said Kodak CFO David Bullwinkle in the company\u2019s earnings report.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the company has faced financial struggles. It filed for bankruptcy in 2012. Since then, the company has expanded into other industries it believes have growth potential, including commercial printing services and advanced chemical manufacturing.\n\nIn 2018, Kodak even jumped on the blockchain and cryptocurrency bandwagon, announcing plans to launch a new digital token called KodakCoins. These tokens were meant to power KodakOne, a blockchain-based rights management platform designed to help photographers register and license both new and existing work through a secure digital ledger.\n\nBut the project never got off the ground, and Kodak eventually scrapped the plan.\n\nNow, the company is highlighting its latest move into pharmaceuticals. The company is opening a manufacturing facility in Rochester, NY, to produce key starting ingredients for drugs.",

      "text": "Eastman Kodak, the 133-year-old photography company, is warning investors thats it might not survive much longer.\nIn its earnings report Monday, the company warned that it doesn\u2019t have \u201ccommitted financing or available liquidity\u201d to pay its roughly $500 million in upcoming debt obligations. \u201cThese conditions raise substantial doubt about the company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern,\u201d Kodak said in a filing.\nKodak aims to conjure up cash by ceasing payments for its retirement pension plan. It also said that it doesn\u2019t expect tariffs to have \u201cmaterial impacts\u201d on its business because it manufactures its many of its products, includings cameras, inks and film in the United States.\n\u201cIn the second quarter, Kodak continued to make progress against our long-term plan despite the challenges of an uncertain business environment,\u201d said Kodak CEO Jim Continenza in the earnings release.\nIn a statement to CNN Tuesday, a Kodak spokesperson said that it\u2019s \u201cconfident it will be able to pay off a significant portion of its term loan well before it becomes due, and amend, extend or refinance our remaining debt and/or preferred stock obligations.\u201d\nShares of Eastman Kodak (KODK) slumped more than 25% in midday trading Tuesday.\nRise and fall\nThe Eastman Kodak Company incorporated in 1892, but the company traces its roots back to 1879, when George Eastman obtained hist first patent for a plate-coating machine. In 1888, Eastman sold the first Kodak camera for $25.\nAt the time, photography was not a mass business because of the technical skills and equipment needed to do it, but the Kodak camera was designed to make photography more widely accessible. Eastman coined the slogan: \u201cYou push the button, we do the rest.\u201d\nThe name was largely meaningless, with the word \u201cKodak,\u201d according to the company, being invented by Eastman out thin air: \u201cThe letter \u2018K\u2019 had been a favorite with me \u2014 it seems a strong, incisive sort of letter.\u201d\nKodak had a century of success producing cameras and film. At one point in the 1970s, it was was responsible for 90% of film and 85% of camera sales in the United States, according to The Economist. Paul Simon\u2019s hit song \u201cKodachrome\u201d topped the charts in 1973.\nBut that powerful market position would not last because of technology that the company invented: Kodak introduced the first digital camera in 1975.\nKodak failed to capitalize on the rise of the digital technology. In 2012, it filed for bankruptcy. At the time of its Chapter 11 filing, it had 100,000 creditors and debts totaling $6.75 billion.\nIn 2020, Kodak had a brief moment of reprieve when the US government tapped it to transform into a pharmaceutical ingredients producer. Kodak\u2019s stock price rose so fast it tripped 20 circuit breakers throughout the trading session.\nDespite its recent losses, Kodak recently said it aims to expand that part of its business. The company continues to manufacture films and chemicals for businesses, including the movie industry, and it licenses its brand for a variety of consumer products.\nCNN\u2019s Clare Duffy contributed to this report."

      "text": "In the past few months, a number of companies have whispered the word \u201cblockchain\u201d and seen their stock prices explode, including a Hooters franchise owner, an iced tea company, and a biotech firm whose CEO promptly sold off around $870,000 in stock. So hey look! Camera manufacturer Kodak is now crypto!\nThat\u2019s right, Kodak is now engaged in some kind of ambiguous crypto venture, the Verge reports. After announcing a \u201cmajor blockchain initiative and cryptocurrency\u201d on Tuesday, Kodak\u2019s stocks have jumped to $6.80 as of around 11pm ET after hovering in the $3 range all week.\nThat\u2019s the crypto blockchain magic at work, baby!\nCrypto. Block. Chain:\nKodakCoins will work as tokens inside the new blockchain-powered KodakOne rights management platform. The platform will supposedly create a digital ledger of rights ownership that photographers can use to register and license new and old work. Both the platform and cryptocurrency are supposed to \u201cempower photographers and agencies to take greater control in image rights management,\u201d according to the press release. The digital currency is meant to create a new economy for photographers to receive payment and sell work on a secure platform.\nIn a statement that could be fairly said to read a little too much on-the-nose, Kodak CEO Jeff Clarke said, \u201cFor many in the tech industry, \u2018blockchain\u2019 and \u2018cryptocurrency\u2019 are hot buzzwords, but for photographers who\u2019ve long struggled to assert control over their work and how it\u2019s used, these buzzwords are the keys to solving what felt like an unsolvable problem.\u201d\nPer Barron\u2019s, Clarke said later in the day that blockchain technology would \u201cbe tremendously significant\u201d in the future, though he clarified, \u201cThis doesn\u2019t change the fundamentals in a way that means the stock should double.\u201d\nCrypto.\nBlock.\nChain!"
