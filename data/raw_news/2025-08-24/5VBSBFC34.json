  "title": "Why Luca Netz Will Be 'Disappointed' If Pudgy Penguins Doesn't IPO Within 2 Years",
  "description": "Luca Netz wants to be held accountable for taking Pudgy Penguins public within two years. Here's what the crypto-native IP has in store.",
  "content": "Pudgy Penguins is on track to clock a record $50 million in revenue this year, according to its CEO Luca Netz\u2014the culmination of a years-long play to plaster the popular IP across corners of the world typically unchartered by Web3 projects, including arcades, storybooks, and even major retailers like Walmart.\n\nBut Netz is already looking ahead to Pudgies' march to an even larger and far more lucrative arena over the next two years: Wall Street.\n\nIn an interview with Decrypt, Netz said he would like to see shares of Pudgy Penguins trade on a public exchange by 2027.\n\n\u201cI would love to [go public] in the next two years,\u201d he said, adding that a timeline for the would-be public listing is contingent upon Pudgy\u2019s revenue growth. \u201cI think if we don't IPO in the next two years, I\u2019d be disappointed in myself.\"\n\nAnd if it doesn\u2019t pan out by that deadline, \u201chold me accountable,\u201d Netz said.\n\nPudgy\u2019s aim to go public comes as the firm experiments with various business verticals amid an IPO revival in the U.S. that has pumped massive amounts of capital into tech companies, in particular.\n\nMore than 220 firms have listed their shares on public exchanges year-to-date, up nearly 90% from the 117 companies that debuted on the U.S. stock market in the first eight months of 2024, according to markets research website StockAnalysis.com.\n\nAmid that IPO resurgence, several digital assets firms have jumped into the fray, filing to go public as U.S. President Donald Trump ratchets back federal regulations for the industry.\n\nStablecoin issuer Circle unveiled its blockbuster IPO in early June, notching more than $1 billion in profits. Just two months later, crypto exchange Bullish debuted on the New York Stock Exchange, while competitors Gemini and Kraken are gearing up to follow suit.\n\nPudgy is attempting to capitalize on growing public interest in digital assets-linked firms by working with finance experts to make Pudgy Penguins and its associated decentralized-finance token PENGU more accessible to retail and institutional investors.\n\nEarlier this year, the company shepherded asset manager Canary Capital\u2019s proposal to debut an exchange-traded fund tracking the prices of the PENGU meme coin and Pudgy Penguins NFTs. More recently, the Pudgy team was in talks with public companies to hold PENGU on their balance sheets\u2014the results of which could play out over the next three months.\n\nMoonbirds NFTs Are Soaring Again: What's Behind the Price Surge\n\n\u201cThe understanding of traditional finance just gets me super excited,\" Netz said. \"There's so much more capital inflows and accessibility.\u201d",

The firm\u2019s USDC and EURC stablecoins are being custodied by Coinbase.\n\"Bullish\u2019s use of stablecoins in its IPO merges public market infrastructure with blockchain rails, and highlights Solana\u2019s unique position to power a new era of market efficiency and innovation,\u201d said Solana Foundation President Lily Liu, in a statement.\nWhile stablecoins have been one of the leading adoption drivers during this crypto cycle, most stablecoin market activity takes place on Ethereum\u2014a network that JPMorgan recently said is suited for \u201cmeteoric\u201d stablecoin growth in the future.\nAt present time, Ethereum holds more than $142 billion in stablecoins compared to nearly $12 billion on Solana\u2019s network, according to data from DefiLlama.\nBlockchain Lender Figure Technologies Preps for IPO as Tokenization Space \u2018Maturing\u2019\nA representative for Bullish did not immediately respond to Decrypt\u2019s question about the firm\u2019s decision to choose Solana for a large portion of its stablecoins, nor its plans for stablecoin use beyond fund transfers.\nShares of BLSH quickly tripled after hitting the market last week, topping out at $118. Now shares in the firm\u2014which also owns crypto media publication CoinDesk\u2014are trading at about $59, down almost 7% on the day and roughly 50% from its peak."

Circle initially aimed to sell 24 million shares at $24 to $26.\nA surge in demand pushed the range up to $27\u2013$28 earlier this week, before pricing topped it late on Wednesday.\nShares will begin trading on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker CRCL.\nUSDC, Circle\u2019s flagship product, currently accounts for about 24.5% of the stablecoin market with $61.5 billion in circulation, according to CoinGecko data.\nBlackRock, which manages the $53.3 billion reserve fund backing USDC, is expected to acquire 10% of IPO shares, according to sources cited by Bloomberg.\nARK Invest also expressed interest in purchasing up to $150 million worth of shares.\nCircle reported $156 million in net income on $1.68 billion in revenue for 2024, a decline from $268 million in net income the prior year, according to its April S-1 filing.\nThe listing comes as Congress advances legislation to regulate stablecoins, with final passage expected sometime in August.\nCircle, which received a New York BitLicense in 2015, is widely seen as one of the most compliance-forward players in the space.\nThis story is developing and will be updated once trading begins."

      "text": "Crypto asset managers continue to bet big on altcoins, with the latest exchange-traded fund issuer, Canary Capital, seeking regulatory approval to list a fund tracking Pudgy Penguins (PENGU).\nNashville, Tennessee-based Canary Capital on Thursday filed an S-1 form seeking approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its Canary PENGU ETF\u2014a fund that will hold both the token in question and NFTs from the prominent Ethereum NFT collection.\nPENGU is the Solana-based token of the Pudgy Penguins NFT project. The token launched in January, shooting up in value before crashing hard alongside most other meme coins. It's now priced 90% below the high of $0.068 it touched following its launch, CoinGecko data shows.\nThe token saw a short-lived price spike Thursday following the announcement, but has since lost that momentum and is down by 2% on the day. PENGU is the 161st most valuable cryptocurrency by market cap, as of this writing.\nDemand for smaller coins and tokens is pushing asset managers to file applications with the SEC\u2014a byproduct of the more crypto-friendly policies of U.S. President Donald Trump.\nPudgy Penguins CEO Luca Netz told Decrypt that the project was \"excited to be a part of crypto history with the first NFT and coin filing.\"\nETFs are popular investment vehicles that trade on stock exchanges and give investors exposure to an underlying asset. The SEC gave the green light to Bitcoin ETFs last year, leading to a flood of capital into the space.\nThen, in July, Ethereum ETFs started trading after the regulator quietly approved the products. The funds haven't been as successful as their Bitcoin counterparts, but demand for crypto-focused products in traditional financial forms has been strong.\nCanary Capital, VanEck, 21Shares and Bitwise, are among those trying to get ETFs tracking coins such as XRP, Solana, and Litecoin, among others, on the market for U.S. investors.\nEdited by James Rubin and Andrew Hayward"

Originally a cute profile picture NFT collection, Pudgy Penguins endured the ousting of its founder before finding mainstream success, with licensed toys landing on the shelves of Walmart and Target stores nationwide.\nLaunched amid the NFT boom in 2021, the collection and its ecosystem of companions has become the face of Web3, garnering millions of social impressions and exploding beyond the relatively small sector of crypto participants on X (formerly known as Twitter).\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about Pudgy Penguins.\nWhat are Pudgy Penguins?\nA collection of 8,888 flightless bird NFTs, Pudgy Penguins first launched in July 2021, selling out shortly after launch for a price of 0.03 ETH, or around $90 at the time, according to data from NFT Price Floor.\nThe collection quickly gained acclaim, gracing the cover of the New York Times in August 2021 after columnist Kevin Roose shared his experience in \u201cjoining the Huddle.\u201d\nIn just a few months after its mint, the collection held a floor price, or the lowest listed asset on the marketplace, of more than $6,000 according to NFT Price Floor. That price would dip towards $1,000 through the next six months amid the subsiding of NFT mania and some unrest within its community, leading to the ousting of its founder and a leadership turnover.\nAll change at the top\nRestlessness in the Pudgy Penguins community grew throughout the early months of 2022 in part due to criticisms of its project founder, Cole Villemain, who goes by ColeThereum on X.\nAllegations of mismanagement and more led to distrust between the founding team and the community.\nAs displeasure with the team grew increasingly loud, the project held a community vote which led to the removal of Villemain and takeover offers from the community.\nOne offer came from Netz Capital's Luca Netz, who publicly offered around $2.5 million, or 750 ETH, in January 2022.\n750 ETH for @Pudgy_Penguins by the NFT degenerates. Make your move @ColeThereum\n\u2014 Luca Netz \ud83d\udc27\u2733\ufe0f (@LucaNetz) January 6, 2022\nMonths later, that offer was accepted and Netz purchased the project and its intellectual property for the amount, tweeting that he was \u201clooking forward to spreading love.\u201d\nAfter Netz\u2019 acquisition, the Pudgy Penguins floor price quickly rebounded, jumping from about $4,300 on the day of the announcement to $8,900 three days later.\nUnder new leadership, the project quickly installed a new roadmap and began the journey to establishing itself as a leading NFT project.\nPudgy Penguins: from NFTs to toys\nOne of the first major initiatives led by the new leadership was launching a Pudgy Toys line.\nThe project announced its intentions to work with PMI Toys in July 2022, for which it licensed Pudgy Penguin NFTs via its OverpassIP project, allowing holders to directly benefit from the usage of their Pudgy NFTs in commercial endeavors such as the physical toys.\nThe first toyline launched in May 2023 and could be purchased directly on Amazon, but it later expanded to include major retail partnerships with Walmart, Target, Walgreens, and more.\nJust a year after rollout, Pudgy Toys had sold more than 750,000 units, according to the company, bringing in more than $10 million in the process.\nBuilding the Pudgy Penguins brand\nSince Netz took over the Pudgy Penguins have been hard at work to reach as many eyeballs around the world as possible and proliferate the brand.\nOne major focus for Pudgy Penguins has been in growing its social media channels to reach more consumers. The project had around 100,000 Instagram followers in July 2022, but it has since increased that following to 1.7 million as of January 2025 while amassing more than 39 billion GIF shares, according to data from GIPHY.\nEfforts to spur the brand even further were buoyed when it raised $9 million in 2023 shortly after signing with talent agency WME.\nSince that time, it\u2019s also gone on to notch collaborations with brands like PEZ, CD Castellon, and Last Crumb (as well as MYRIAD, the prediction market from Decrypt\u2019s parent company DASTAN).\nPENGU: The Pudgy Penguins token\nIn November 2024, the project announced it would launch an ecosystem token on Solana as a way to better align incentives between the brand and its fans. The PENGU token was claimable for Pudgy Penguin NFT holders and a wide range of other Web3 communities and active crypto participants.\nThe token launched in December 2024, granting holders of Pudgy Penguins NFTs with 1.7 million PENGU tokens, worth more than $100,000 at the token\u2019s all-time high as recorded by CoinGecko.\nBeyond Pudgy Penguins: the other NFTs\nIt\u2019s not just \u201cbig Pudgys\u201d that make up the Penguin NFT ecosystem.\nLil Pudgys\nThe Pudgy Penguins ecosystem first grew with the launch of Lil Pudgys.\nA companion was claimable for free for each of the 8,888 Pudgy Penguins NFTs, with another batch of Lil Pudgys going on sale to the general public for a total of 22,222 smaller versions of the original NFT.\nIn January 2023, the collection went \u201ccross-chain\u201d as part of the project\u2019s partnership with interoperability platform LayerZero. Holders were able to transport their Lil\u2019 Pudgys via a bridge in an effort to expand the Penguin IP.\n\u201cBy enabling the Lil Pudgys to go cross-chain, we\u2019re setting up the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem to reach millions of people,\u201d the project wrote.\nLil Pudgys can bridge from Ethereum mainnet to Arbitrum, Polygon, or Binance Smart Chain.\nPudgy Rods (Rogs)\nPudgy Rods are a collection of fishing rod NFTs that were gifted to Pudgy Penguin holders in 2021.\nThe collection was initially named \u201cPudgy Presents,\u201d but later changed to Pudgy Rods after fishing rods hatched from the eggs which previously populated the metadata for the NFTs.\nThe mismatch of fishing rods hatching from an egg was met with confusion from the community and added to the tension between the founding team and ecosystem participants that arose in late 2021.\nSince that time, the Rods have found their home as the third NFT in the Pudgy hierarchy, granting holders similar benefits to those of the original Pudgys, like a PENGU token claim, albeit at smaller scales.\nThe future of Pudgy Penguins\nThough the project already has big accomplishments under its belt, Netz has big plans for the project in the future.\nThe project\u2019s parent company, Igloo Inc., is actively building out Pudgy World\u2014a Web3 playground and storytelling universe that houses mini-games and customizable Penguins with a direct link to Pudgy Toys, which provide a QR code to get new users onboarded.\nBeyond Pudgy World, the project is also working on Pudgy Party, a mobile royale game built together with Mythical Games."
