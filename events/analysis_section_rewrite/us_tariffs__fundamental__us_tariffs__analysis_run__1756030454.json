      "feedback": "This draft has strong multi-source texture and a plausible cross-border regime story, but it needs a tighter, first‑principles, multi‑year framing and explicit catalysts/invalidations to reach world‑class quality. Gaps: the causal chain from policy to market pricing is asserted but not grounded in invariant economics (e.g., real rate differentials, terms of trade, productivity, BoP dynamics, policy reaction functions) and it lacks clearly delineated regimes with transition conditions. It underutilizes first‑principles anchors (no explicit multi‑year anchors for tariff pass‑through, import price inflation, or macro risk premia) and relies on single‑period tallies (e.g., 15% across‑the‑board tariff, 18.6% average tariff) without embedding them into a durable, regime‑based narrative. On scope, incorporate a structured base case plus at least two alternative paths (deregulation‑driven persistence vs. escalation of protectionism) and tie each to observable triggers (court rulings on tariffs; CRA reversals; EU/UK concessions; notable subsidies or equity stakes). The transmission mechanism should be codified as a chain: policy action (tariffs/subsidies/regulatory shifts) -> import prices and domestic costs -> consumer/investment prices and real incomes -> sectoral margins, capex, and supply-chain realignment; ground each link with the most explicit numbers you have (RHFWI02JT for tariffs and inflation pass‑through, 2SJORBV6H for cross‑border protectionism signals, QRX2HD4X0 for embedded-finance resilience, 5M9M1KACF/9W8ZUIBDY for regulatory/deregulatory dynamics) and reconcile any conflicts (e.g., deregulation rhetoric vs. selective competition actions). Quantification should be concrete: give base-case ranges (e.g., short-run CPI impact ~1.5–2.5% from tariff pass‑through; average tariff load around 18–19% with a 15% ceiling in the EU framework; potential equities/CHIPS subsidies of ~$7.8B–$8B with a 10% government stake; potential chip‑tariff escalations up to 300% per sources). Extend the narrative with explicit catalysts/triggers and invalidation paths: new tariff/exemption decisions, court rulings on emergency powers, CRA reversals, and flips in the regulatory agenda; specify what would invalidate the base-case (e.g., durable reversal of tariffs, or a credible shift to aggressive deregulation that lowers policy risk premia). Ensure coverage parity across sources (RHFWI02JT, 5M9M1KACF, 9W8ZUIBDY, 2SJORBV6H, QRX2HD4X0) and clearly reconcile tensions (Trump‑era deregulation vs Biden competition-order critiques). Finally, sharpen structure to satisfy horizon/style constraint: present a multi‑year regime (regime states, transition conditions, base case, risks, watch list, confidence) in a concise, citation‑anchored way, and avoid aggregating into broad platitudes. Suggested edits: insert invariant anchors and regime taxonomy, turn qualitative claims into numerically bounded scenarios, add explicit catalysts/invalidations with trigger thresholds, and weave in the cross‑source tensions with explicit reconciliation notes. Citations to anchor assertions should be placed near the corresponding claims, e.g., (RHFWI02JT) for the EU framework and 15% tariff architecture, (5M9M1KACF)/(9W8ZUIBDY) for the regulatory/deregulatory posture, (2SJORBV6H) for Japan’s anti‑dumping signal, (QRX2HD4X0) for embedded‑finance resilience and macro headwinds.",
