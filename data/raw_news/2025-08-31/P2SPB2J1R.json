  "description": "Looking for a VPN for online banking? Here are the best VPNs available for secure banking across real platforms and public networks.",
  "content": "You\u2019re at the airport, connected to public Wi\u2011Fi, and trying to pay your credit card bill. You hit \u201cLog In\u201d, and suddenly the screen freezes, reloads, or worse, locks you out. Banks today are picky about where and how you connect. Add a VPN to the mix, and things can get even trickier. Still, that doesn\u2019t mean VPNs are a bad idea for banking. In fact, more than 1 in 3 users now rely on VPNs to protect their online transactions and hide sensitive activity from trackers, snoops, or bad Wi\u2011Fi setups. The real challenge is finding one that offers privacy without triggering your bank\u2019s security alarms.\n\nSome VPNs get flagged due to unstable IP addresses, while others drop the connection at the worst time, breaking two-factor logins or showing you as halfway across the world. But the right VPN for banking keeps your session encrypted, your location consistent, and your bank app running like nothing happened.\n\nWe tested five of the best VPNs for online banking across real platforms, public networks, and devices you actually use. If you want to stay secure without getting locked out, start here.\n\nIs It Safe to Use a VPN for Online Banking?\n\nThe short answer is yes, using a trusted VPN for banking is one of the smartest ways to go about your financial journey. It encrypts your traffic, shields you from hackers on sketchy networks, and keeps your data private from your internet provider. But as with anything online, the fine print matters.\n\nWhen you connect to your bank\u2019s website or app, sensitive data like login credentials, account balances, and transaction history gets transmitted. Without a VPN, that data moves in plain sight on public networks. Coffee shop Wi\u2011Fi, airport lounges, and even hotel networks can be breeding grounds for man-in-the-middle attacks. A reliable VPN puts a secure tunnel around your connection so that no one else can peek inside.\n\nThat said, a VPN doesn\u2019t make you bulletproof. It won\u2019t protect you from phishing scams, or if your device is already compromised with malware. It also won\u2019t help if you click on a fake banking site. What it does do is prevent your real IP address from leaking and keeps your connection from bouncing around in a way that might trigger security alerts.\n\nSome banks get twitchy about VPN traffic. If the VPN server changes too often or comes from a suspicious region, you might get flagged. That\u2019s why it\u2019s best to choose a stable server near your actual location and stick with it.\n\nBest VPNs for Online Banking in 2025: Detailed List\n\nWe didn\u2019t just pick the biggest names in the industry and call it a day. We tested each VPN across real banking platforms, from Chase and Wells Fargo to Revolut, N26, and a few old-school credit unions.\n\nUsing both desktop and mobile apps on shaky hotel Wi\u2011Fi and home broadband, the goal was to find VPNs that keep your bank from locking you out or throwing endless CAPTCHA loops.\n\nHere\u2019s how they stack up.\n\n1. NordVPN \u2014 Best Overall for Online Banking\n\nNordVPN hits the sweet spot for users who want top-tier privacy without messing up their bank access. With fast US servers, leak-proof protection, and built-in threat blocking, it\u2019s built for secure sessions that don\u2019t raise red flags.\n\nNordVPN is loaded with the right mix of features for online banking. Its Threat Protection blocks phishing domains, trackers, and malware before they ever reach your browser. That\u2019s huge when you\u2019re checking your bank account on public Wi\u2011Fi or browsing through financial emails. And its RAM-only servers mean no data gets stored ever.\n\nIn our tests with NordVPN, it worked flawlessly with major platforms like Revolut, U.S. Bank, HSBC, and even more sensitive apps like Monzo and Capital One, which are known to be finicky with VPN connections.\n\nWe ran NordVPN through login tests on desktop and mobile. On mobile banking apps, we used split tunneling to exclude SMS-based 2FA apps from the VPN, and it worked perfectly. No delays, no missed codes. Connecting to nearby US servers kept our IP location consistent, so we never hit login blocks or \u201cunusual activity\u201d alerts.\n\nIts NordLynx protocol gave us consistently fast speeds even on 4G hotspots, which helped us load encrypted banking sessions quickly without timeout errors. And when we deliberately killed the connection, NordVPN\u2019s kill switch stepped in smoothly to prevent any data leaks mid-session.\n\nYou can run NordVPN on up to 10 devices at once, and it works across all platforms, including Windows, iOS, Android, and macOS. It starts at around $3 per month on a long-term plan, which is solid considering the security stack it comes with. And its no-logs policy has been independently audited multiple times, so your activity stays yours.\n\nExpressVPN is all about smooth, secure banking without surprises. During our tests, it worked seamlessly with platforms like Chase, Wells Fargo, and PayPal, even on strict mobile apps that usually hate VPNs. What makes it stand out is how consistently it maintains session stability, even during network switches or device hops. We logged in from both mobile and desktop on hotel Wi\u2011Fi, and ExpressVPN never dropped the ball.\n\nIts Lightway Turbo protocol is what keeps everything running fast and lean. Even when switching from Wi\u2011Fi to mobile data mid-session, we didn\u2019t hit any banking timeouts or forced logouts. For anyone who moves around a lot, this reliability can\u2019t be overstated. ExpressVPN also runs on RAM-only TrustedServer infrastructure, which erases all data with every reboot. No logs, no leftovers, no risks.\n\nWhile some VPNs get flagged due to overused or shared IPs, ExpressVPN\u2019s US servers seemed fresh every time. We didn\u2019t encounter any location mismatches, even on more sensitive platforms. It also comes with a Network Lock kill switch, so if your connection drops unexpectedly, your banking session doesn\u2019t leak data into the wild. That peace of mind alone makes the slightly higher price tag feel worth it and starts at just around $5 per month on an annual plan.\n\nWe also liked how easy it was to use across all devices. The app is clean, fast, and doesn\u2019t bury you in options. Whether you\u2019re banking from an iPhone, Android tablet, or Windows laptop, ExpressVPN delivers that click-and-go experience, making it one of the most reliable VPN for banking on the list.\n\nPrivate Internet Access is built for control freaks, and that\u2019s a good thing when it comes to online banking. Unlike many VPNs that go for plug-and-play simplicity, PIA lets you customize nearly everything, from encryption levels to DNS preferences. We used it to fine-tune connections for different banks, and it handled them all without raising red flags.\n\nOne of the biggest standouts is that PIA offers servers in every US state, including some underrepresented ones like Idaho and South Dakota. This broad spread helped us avoid fraud alerts when logging in from smaller regions. It also means you can stay close to your actual location while keeping your IP address private, which is a key detail if your bank watches for IP mismatches.\n\nOn the security side, it\u2019s just as solid. Private Internet Access has a strict no-logs policy that\u2019s been proven in court, plus open-source apps that anyone can audit. In our tests, the kill switch worked as expected, and we saw no IP, DNS, or WebRTC leaks, even during forced disconnects. Mobile banking apps like Capital One, Discover, and regional credit union portals all worked without glitches.\n\nWhat surprised us most was the speed. We got steady, reliable performance on both OpenVPN and WireGuard, with WireGuard offering slightly faster loads for banking apps. We also appreciated PIA\u2019s MACE feature, which blocks trackers and scripts that might be lurking on financial sites.\n\nPrivate Internet Access starts at just over $2 per month with a long-term plan, which makes it one of the most affordable options in this lineup. And with support for unlimited devices, it\u2019s ideal for shared households or power users juggling multiple gadgets.\n\n4. Surfshark \u2014 Best for Multi-Device Banking With Extra Privacy\n\nIf you\u2019re banking on more than one device, or want your whole household covered, Surfshark is the most flexible pick. It\u2019s one of the only VPNs allows unlimited connections, so you can secure your phone, laptop, tablet, and even your parents\u2019 devices without juggling logins or bumping into limits.\n\nDuring tests, Surfshark worked smoothly with banks like Ally, Huntington, and Navy Federal, both through browsers and mobile apps. We didn\u2019t hit any login loops or location mismatch errors. And since Surfshark has servers in plenty of mid-sized US cities, we were able to stay geographically close to our real location, which helped avoid any 2FA hiccups.\n\nIts CleanWeb feature is a quiet winner here. It blocks ads, trackers, and malware, keeping shady scripts off your bank\u2019s login pages. That extra layer of protection is especially helpful when banking over public Wi\u2011Fi or when someone else in the house might click the wrong link.\n\nSpeed-wise, Surfshark runs fast and stable, especially when paired with WireGuard. Sessions loaded quickly, even during off-peak hours or while tethering on mobile. On Android, you can even turn on GPS spoofing, which makes your device location match your VPN IP, a handy trick for mobile banking apps that double-check both.\n\nPricing starts at around $2.50 per month, which is a great value considering all the extras it offers. For privacy-conscious users who don\u2019t want to overthink things, Surfshark offers simplicity, speed, and smart protection in one.\n\nProton VPN is the only provider on this list that gives you a way to bank securely without paying a cent upfront, which makes it a solid entry point for privacy-conscious users. But let\u2019s be clear, if you\u2019re serious about consistent banking access, you\u2019ll want to upgrade to the Plus plan.\n\nWe tested both tiers, and while the free version delivered encrypted, leak-free connections across a handful of US servers, it didn\u2019t always play nice with every banking platform. Load times were slower, and some mobile apps got stuck during login. But once we switched to the Plus plan, everything opened up. High-speed servers, priority routing, and better uptime meant smooth logins on Revolut, N26, Chase, and several other apps known to be picky.\n\nProton VPN is based in Switzerland, where strict privacy laws back its no-logs policy, and all apps are open source and independently audited. It also runs Secure Core servers, which route your traffic through privacy-safe countries before exiting, which is a useful feature for anyone worried about surveillance or tracking at the ISP level.\n\nProton VPN doesn\u2019t overload you with features, but it nails the ones that matter for banking: DNS and IPv6 leak protection, a reliable kill switch, and multi-hop routing for extra-sensitive sessions. On the Plus plan, speeds were strong even on mobile, and we didn\u2019t run into any two-factor delays or flagged logins.\n\nThe free version is a solid start if you\u2019re banking casually or just want encryption on public Wi\u2011Fi, but the Plus plan (around $3 a month) is where it really becomes a serious tool for financial privacy. That said, even with its paid plan, Proton VPN still falls short of the service offered by NordVPN.\n\nCommon Banking Errors With VPNs (and How to Avoid Them)\n\nUsing a VPN for online banking sounds smart, until your bank decides it\u2019s suspicious. If you\u2019ve ever been blocked mid-login or forced into extra verification, chances are your VPN setup triggered some red flags. Fortunately, these issues are avoidable with the right strategy.\n\nBanks have fraud detection systems that monitor your IP address, device, and location history. If you log in from a VPN server in a different state or country than usual, even once, it can trigger security alerts. To avoid this, always use the same city-level server, ideally near your actual location. Stick with VPN providers that offer reliable US server options without constant IP rotation, like NordVPN.\n\nSome banking apps require SMS or email verification that can get blocked or delayed when you\u2019re connected through a VPN. Using split tunneling (where your VPN bypasses the banking app or SMS service) helps keep 2FA running smoothly. Most top-tier VPNs support this feature on mobile and desktop.\n\nHave you ever tried to log in, only for the page to reload endlessly or throw an error? That\u2019s often due to banks detecting a VPN IP range associated with data centers or shared use. Free VPNs or smaller providers are most prone to this. To avoid it, choose a VPN with dedicated or frequently refreshed IP pools, like ExpressVPN or Proton VPN\u2019s Plus plan.\n\nApps often compare your device\u2019s GPS location with your IP address. If the two don\u2019t match, you might get booted or blocked. Some VPNs, like Surfshark, offer GPS spoofing on Android to align both signals. Otherwise, your safest bet is to use a nearby VPN server and keep location services turned off while banking.\n\nIf your bank suddenly starts asking you to \u201cverify you\u2019re human,\u201d it\u2019s likely because your VPN IP was flagged for suspicious activity. This is common with overused or blacklisted servers, especially on free VPNs. Switch to a lower-traffic location or a premium provider to reduce the friction.\n\nA good VPN for banking is about trust, consistency, and not getting locked out when you need access most. The right one keeps your IP stable, your traffic leak-free, and your sessions smooth, no matter where you\u2019re logging in from.\n\nWhile every VPN on this list offers something useful, NordVPN stands out as the most well-rounded choice.\n\nBetween its Threat Protection feature, fast NordLynx protocol, and strong record with finicky banking platforms, it hits the mark for both privacy and usability.",

      "text": "It doesn\u2019t get much better than Proton VPN and NordVPN. These security giants pack the power of a bull, offering a litany of servers, ironclad privacy, and unbeatable security. Both providers are built like a tank, with excellent performance and streaming abilities.\nThis makes the Proton VPN vs NordVPN comparison quite difficult. We have two all-around options whose prices are pocket-friendly. On the other hand, they seem to be very similar, with very few differences, at least on paper. So, what\u2019s the best course of action?\nWhich VPN should you choose as your main driver; NordVPN or Proton VPN? This comparison will address this question and answer it clearly. As always, you\u2019ll get a clear winner, with no \u201cit depends\u201d types of answers. Let this fierce battle begin \u2013 it\u2019ll be rough.\nProton VPN vs NordVPN: Overview\nLet\u2019s cut it short for those too impatient. NordVPN is a better provider in general and our go-to option when pinned against Proton VPN. Here are some of their most notable features side by side to hopefully help you decide:\n| Proton VPN | NordVPN | |\n| Our Current Ranking | #4 | #1 |\n| Prices | Starting At $3.59/mo | Starting At $3.09/mo |\n| Money-Back Guarantee | 30 Days | 30 Days |\n| Free Version | Yes | No |\n| Logging | No | No |\n| Protocols | WireGuard, OpenVPN | NordLynx, OpenVPN |\n| Servers | 8,200+ in 112 countries | 6,400+ in 111 countries |\n| Specialty Servers | Onion Over VPN, P2P, Streaming, Secure Core | Double VPN, Obfuscated, Onion Over VPN, P2P, Dedicated IP |\n| RAM-Only Servers | Yes | Yes |\n| Working With Netflix | Yes (~10 catalogs) | Yes (20+ catalogs) |\n| P2P Allowance | Yes | Yes |\n| Simultaneous Connections | 10 | 10 |\nApplications & Ease of Use\nTo use a VPN, you need to install the app \u2013 that\u2019s how a VPN works. The good thing about both is their compatibility. NordVPN and Proton VPN work on Windows, Linux, and macOS computers. Simultaneously, they have clients for iPhones and Android phones \u2013 nice!\nWhen it comes to \u201cnon-typical\u201d platforms, both providers do just fine. For example, you\u2019ll find their apps on Amazon Store, which means they can be installed on Firestick. NordVPN has a phenomenal Apple TV app, while both offer a native Android TV option.\nEase of use is a strong point of both rivals. Proton VPN and NordVPN look similar, with a world map in the middle and the server list on the left. The latter looks a bit better but generally, they\u2019re easy to use and quick to connect. The entire process lasts a second.\nNordVPN\u2019s settings are accessible in seconds and you don\u2019t have to open new windows. Proton VPN is the same but its settings menu boots up in the new window, which looks a bit cheap to us. Its mobile apps are state-of-the-art, excelling in snappiness and simplicity.\nWhat about their browser extensions? Well, we know that NordVPN is a superior Chrome VPN; it offers extensions for other browsers, as well. On top of that, NordVPN\u2019s extensions support location spoofing and are streaming-optimized. Proton VPN is lacking a bit in comparison to NordVPN.\nIt has WebRTC leak protection and Secure Core \u2013 two still great features. Simultaneous connections are identical on both sides \u2013 we have 10. That brings us to the result of the first Proton VPN vs NordVPN round. No doubt, it\u2019s a tie having everything we said in mind.\nNordVPN vs Proton VPN: Price Comparison\nWhich VPN costs more, Proton VPN or NordVPN? That\u2019s a good question but you\u2019ll be surprised at how similarly priced they are, at least in their cheapest variants.\nNordVPN Prices\nNordVPN\u2019s flexibility shines brightly with every inspection. It offers 2-year, 1-year, and 1-month plans, where the first are the cheapest. At the moment, the provider costs roughly $3.1 a month, with a 73% discount and 3 free months. If you ask us, a great price.\nIf you move on to its 1-year plans, the monthly price will jump but you\u2019ll commit to a shorter. Notice that its annual plans don\u2019t have 3 free months, so they\u2019re not as generous. We won\u2019t delve deeper into its monthly deals because they\u2019re not deals but rather expensive plans.\nNordVPN\u2019s Basic plan is enough to make you jump in excitement. However, the Plus plan is a lot better and costs about $1/mo more, which is why we recommend it. All plans have a 30-day money-back guarantee, allowing for swift refunds if your satisfaction is null.\nAlso, don\u2019t expect a free plan here. The only way to get it for free is with a 7-day free trial through Google Play. You\u2019ll need an Android device for that. If you do, know that this is the most impressive provider for this system \u2013 other great VPNs for Android are here.\nProton VPN Prices\nProton VPN has three amazing plans with the prices displayed below. Warning \u2013 these prices are available through Gizmodo and are a part of Proton VPN\u2019s special discount. Essentially, this is the same 2-year plan that costs a little over $3.5 \u2013 no free months here.\nThe 12-month plan is also not to be overlooked, as it costs just under $4 a month and is considered far cheaper than ExpressVPN\u2019s equivalent at $6.67. Even the monthly plan is a great option considering it\u2019s around $10 and not over $12 like NordVPN.\nProton VPN has never been cheap, as its 2-year plan was priced at $5 a month; give or take. Nowadays, Proton VPN\u2019s price is much more feasible, and with a 30-day money-back guarantee, it\u2019s risk-free in case you want to jump in on board. There\u2019s another incentive.\nProton VPN has a FREE plan that you can use forever. You need to sign up, install its app, and enjoy unlimited bandwidth, stone-hard security, and no-logging practices. While this provider is marginally more expensive, the addition of an excellent free VPN is tremendous.\nGet the Best Proton VPN\u2019s Deal\nAll of this means one thing: it is Proton VPN\u2019s victory in the second round against NordVPN.\nNordVPN vs Proton VPN Features\nSimilar prices don\u2019t always mean a comparable level of quality and features. In this section of the Proton VPN vs NordVPN analysis, let\u2019s see which provider will prevail and offer more features and better security.\nShared Features\nSince VPNs work the same, we can always expect some similar, if not the same features. Let\u2019s list them here and see how like-minded Proton VPN and NordVPN are.\n- Strong encryption. Both use AES-256-bit encryption, which keeps you safe at all times. It\u2019s impenetrable and also used by the military, which speaks volumes about its quality.\n- WireGuard. This protocol is widely popular for speed and security. While both offer it, NordVPN has branded it NordLynx. It\u2019s a slightly improved version of the protocol that accentuates anonymity and is somewhat more secure.\n- Ad-blocking. Both providers can block ads and trackers to keep away online threats. NordVPN\u2019s Threat Protection is a bit better than Proton VPN\u2019s Net Shield. We\u2019ll explain why in a minute.\n- Kill switch. You can find this feature in both options and it\u2019s essential for data leak prevention. NordVPN\u2019s advanced kill switch can be customized further to prevent internet access when the VPN is disabled.\n- Split tunneling. Great for routing only specific portions of your traffic. Choose which apps will be tunneled through a VPN and enjoy them without altering your IP.\n- Perfect Forward Secrecy. This feature assigns different encryption keys to each connection, preventing each subsequent session from being compromised. A new connection is followed by a new encryption key for the maximum security.\nUnique Features\nWe haven\u2019t mentioned features like RAM-based servers, IPv6 leak protection, Private DNS, and a few more. These are standard options in flagship providers like NordVPN or Proton VPN, so there\u2019s nothing new. Let\u2019s focus on the differences that will determine the winner.\nDouble VPN/Secure Core Servers\nOne of NordVPN\u2019s key features is a Double VPN. You can use it to effectively double your encryption by routing the connection through two servers. There\u2019s an entry and exit server, creating an unbreakable and untraceable connection for the highest security level.\nNordVPN has \u201cpre-determined\u201d pairs, so you can\u2019t choose entry and exit servers like in Surfshark (we also compared Surfshark to NordVPN here).\nProton VPN has Secure Core servers that work similarly. They also use two servers to secure your connection.\nHowever, one of these servers is either in Iceland, Sweden, or Switzerland. These are so-called \u201cSecure Core\u201d locations shipped and provisioned by Proton. When you activate Secure Core, you can choose through which of these three locations to route your connection first.\nUse Secure Core Servers from Proton VPN\nAfter that, you can select any location you want and enjoy. We believe Proton VPN\u2019s Secure Core is slightly better than NordVPN\u2019s Double VPN servers. It\u2019s more customizable, plus, these servers are owned by Proton.\nStealth/Obfuscation\nProton VPN has a Stealth VPN protocol on Windows and macOS. At the time of this NordVPN vs Proton VPN duel, the latter offers the feature only on these two platforms. As the name implies, it\u2019s made to fight censorship and does so fairly well \u2013 except for China.\nNordVPN has obfuscation in the form of obfuscated servers. They hide the fact that you\u2019re using a VPN and let you bypass deep-packet inspection. We love this feature because it functions so well, even if you\u2019re in the most censored regions \u2013 we\u2019re looking at you, China.\nReal-Time Malware Protection\nWhile Proton can only block ads and trackers \u2013 still commendable, by the way \u2013 NordVPN can protect you against malware. Its Threat Protection comprises Web Protection, File Protection, and Vulnerability Protection, all working towards your ultimate security.\nWeb Protection is real-time protection against malware, ads, and trackers. File Protection protects against malicious downloads, which is handy if you make a mistake and accidentally download something you shouldn\u2019t. Vulnerability Protection is the most interesting.\nIt alerts you about vulnerable apps on your device, letting you know if you\u2019re at risk of cyberattacks. We\u2019ve seen a similar feature in CyberGhost and its optional Security Updater. While we love CyberGhost VPN, Vulnerability Protection in NordVPN is a bit more reliable.\nOther Security Features\nSo far, NordVPN has taken the lead by offering a few more features than Proton VPN overall. We prefer Secure Core over a Double VPN but NordVPN offers even more. For example, there\u2019s Meshnet for secure file sharing, IP routing, and remote device access. A unique feature, mind you.\nThis provider also offers a Dark Web Monitor, which you\u2019ll find buried deep on Proton VPN\u2019s account page when you log in. Paying more for NordVPN\u2019s Complete plan lets you delete your data from data brokers and have a clean slate, which its rival doesn\u2019t offer.\nMake no mistake \u2013 both options are terrific and offer staggering levels of security. However, NordVPN has a slight edge over Proton VPN thanks to more powerful obfuscation, malware protection, Meshnet, and data broker removal from Incogni (available in the Complete plan).\nSecure Your Connection With NordVPN\nDo Proton VPN and NordVPN Store Logs?\nHere\u2019s a short answer \u2013 no. We don\u2019t have to talk in riddles and make this Proton VPN vs NordVPN comparison longer than it needs to be.\nNordVPN\u2019s jurisdiction is Panama, which screams privacy. Switzerland where its rival resides is also phenomenal and privacy-friendly.\nPrivacy Policy Analysis\nMoving on to their privacy policies, we can immediately see some great news. NordVPN\u2019s policy overview tells us that the provider keeps no logs of your IP address, online history, connection timestamps, real location, and so on. No identifiable data whatsoever.\nProton VPN\u2019s concise privacy policy is no less awesome \u2013 it\u2019s pristine! As you can see, the same applies to the Swiss giant that keeps no identifiable information on its servers. Speaking of servers, both providers rely on the RAM-based ones, which is always nice.\nRAM servers can be wiped clean of data with a simple restart. If the server is seized, the provider can flip the switch and clear it in a blink. Both providers have third-party audits as well. We covered audits from PwC and Deloitte in our more detailed NordVPN test.\nProton VPN has several audits that praised its security, privacy, and transparency. After all, Proton operates similarly to Nord Security in terms of efforts to amplify online safety. Such efforts on both sides lead both providers to another tie.\nWhich VPN Is Faster: NordVPN or Proton VPN?\nSpeed is important if you\u2019re always in a hurry. If not, it still is unless you love slow internet connections. Below are the speed test results of our internet without a VPN.\nWe were in Belgrade at the time and have tested both providers 3 times a day, 3 days in a row.\nSince we were in Europe, we used 3 server locations, some nearer, some farther. We focused on the UK, the USA, and Japan as some of the most popular online locations. To ensure we\u2019re leveling the playing field, we also didn\u2019t tinker with protocols \u2013 both VPNs were untouched.\nEnjoy Lightning-Fast Speed With NordVPN\nIn other words, we used \u201cAutomatic\u201d to let them decide which protocols they wanted to use. To better describe how much one is faster than the other, we displayed their average speed drops in percentages in the table below, based on all the tests we\u2019ve performed.\n| Download Speed Loss | Upload Speed Loss | |\n| NordVPN | 18% | 7% |\n| Proton VPN | 43% | 21% |\nThe table shows a clear win for NordVPN. It\u2019s 25% and 14% faster in download and upload speeds. To give you an overview of how that looks in practice, here are the exact speed test results we\u2019ve achieved. You\u2019ll see that the Swiss provider isn\u2019t an avid performer.\n| UK (Download/Upload) | US (Download/Upload) | Japan (Download/Upload) | |\n| NordVPN | 324.25/18.68 Mbps | 292.75/18.31 Mbps | 223.54/17.85 Mbps |\n| Proton VPN | 195.66/18.47 Mbps | 260.69/11.56 Mbps | 119.74/16.21 Mbps |\nStreaming & Torrenting\nLet\u2019s advance this Proton VPN vs NordVPN comparison towards torrenting and streaming \u2013 or vice versa. Both providers excel in these categories but one will inevitably win. Who? Stay with us to find out.\nStreaming\nIn the review of Proton VPN on Gizmodo, we said we loved its streaming and P2P servers. The former servers were surprisingly capable of unblocking Netflix catalogs, Hotstar, BBC iPlayer, and other prevalent services. No errors there, especially if you love watching Netflix.\nThe streaming experience was great despite the provider\u2019s slightly slower speeds. Enabling its VPN Accelerator didn\u2019t do much but still, we didn\u2019t have to use it because our speeds were always above 100 Mbps. Proton VPN lacks Smart DNS, which we hope to see soon.\nUnblock Streaming Platforms With NordVPN\nNordVPN\u2019s streaming prowess doesn\u2019t lie in dedicated servers \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have this type of server. However, it manages to unblock MORE Netflix catalogs, around 20+, and provide a slightly better experience. On top of that, it offers Smart DNS, which extends its abilities.\nKeep in mind the provider is faster, so if your native internet speed is slow, it\u2019ll make a difference. Reducing your speed from 50 Mbps to 30 Mbps is no small feat and will be radically different. Luckily, that won\u2019t happen with the Panamanian provider.\nTorrenting\nP2P downloads and file sharing are a breeze for both NordVPN and Proton VPN. They have P2P-dedicated servers. Connect to one and blitz through your downloads swiftly. Proton VPN includes Port Forwarding, which many use to speed up their torrents but not by much.\nNordVPN offers SOCKS5, which offers almost the same benefits. It can be set up directly in the Torrent client for the best results. In 99.99% of the cases, we haven\u2019t bothered with this. Instead, we just connect to the nearest P2P servers and couldn\u2019t care less!\nTorrenting performance is similar, but streaming is NordVPN\u2019s forte, making it the winner against Proton VPN.\nServer Locations of Proton VPN and NordVPN\nProton VPN\u2019s competitive server fleet will trump almost any provider who faces it. At the time of comparing the two services, the server count is as follows:\n- Proton VPN has 8,200+ servers in 112 countries\n- NordVPN has 6,400+ servers in 111 countries\nThe Swiss company has roughly 2,00 servers more, which wasn\u2019t the case until recently. On the other hand, the server variety is similar, as both offer:\n- Double VPN/Secure Core servers\n- P2P servers\n- Streaming servers (Proton)\n- Onion Over VPN servers\n- Obfuscated servers (NordVPN)\nThe key difference is that NordVPN offers dedicated IP addresses, which are not available with Proton VPN. We\u2019d venture to say it\u2019s the most appreciated dedicated IP VPN at that! The server distribution is immaculate in both, so there\u2019s no point in delving deeper.\nYou\u2019ll find no shortage of locations for day-to-day enjoyment. Proton VPN will win this round because it has more servers but really, we can\u2019t say NordVPN\u2019s server park is unimpressive.\nUse Proton VPN\u2019s Vast Server Fleet\nBypassing Censorship: Which VPN Does It Better?\nDespite its Stealth VPN, Proton VPN\u2019s ability to bypass censorship isn\u2019t always at its apex. For instance, the provider isn\u2019t working in China, which it admits on its website. The good thing is that Stealth works well for restricted networks and \u201cmildly\u201d censored countries.\nOn the other side, NordVPN\u2019s obfuscation blows Proton VPN out of the water. Having tested both in China, we can confirm that NordVPN is working well. The Great Firewall is ever-changing and with frequent upgrades, it\u2019s hard for providers to keep up.\nNordVPN is among the few VPNs that work in China in 2025. Proton VPN is yet to arrive there but we\u2019re excited if they\u2019re cooking up some improvements in this field. To clarify again, NordVPN takes home this round.\nConclusion: NordVPN Wins Against Proton VPN\nIt\u2019s already time to conclude the Proton VPN vs NordVPN analysis. As you noticed, NordVPN came out on top.\nIts award-winning formula that combines security, speed, privacy, and ample servers is no match for the Swiss provider. However, the latter is far from bad. It went almost shoulder-to-shoulder with its \u201cfoe.\u201d\nNordVPN is better regarding security features, streaming, speed, and bypassing censorship. Proton VPN fared better in terms of pricing and server locations, while it was on par in privacy, torrenting, and device compatibility. So, let\u2019s answer your question from the start.\nWhich provider should you pick? Being a superior option overall, you should pick NordVPN. At a similar price point, our experts think this provider is a more sensible investment. However, feel free to follow your heart and pick whichever is your bag of beans."

      "text": "When you buy a VPN, you expect it to be a multi-device one. The best VPNs for multiple devices share two characteristics. They usually offer generous simultaneous connections that even go up to unlimited. Also, they support a wide gamut of devices and operating systems. The two previous sentences ideally describe the best multi-device VPNs of 2025.\nDon\u2019t think every provider has this level of compatibility. For instance, some providers lack an app for Fire TV Stick. Others have no support for routers and don\u2019t work with Linux distros. Such providers haven\u2019t made it to our list. In fact, we targeted the opposite spectrum now.\nThat\u2019s how we forged the list of the top VPNs for multiple devices and brought five options to the table. They range from 8 to unlimited connections, offering native clients for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, and countless other systems. Let\u2019s dive right in.\nThe 5 Best Multi-Device VPNs Ranked\n- NordVPN \u2013 the best VPN for multiple devices overall\n- ExpressVPN \u2013 easy-to-use apps for all devices\n- Proton VPN \u2013 unbeatable privacy on 10 devices at a time\n- Private Internet Access \u2013 unlimited simultaneous connections\n- Surfshark VPN \u2013 limitless streaming on unlimited devices\nBest VPN Services for Multiple Devices\nOur ranking is sorted out, so let\u2019s move on with the reviews. Besides excellent compatibility, our providers offer plenty more features to be excited about. Explore them below and find the one that matches your needs perfectly:\n1. NordVPN\nOur preferred multi-device VPN for 2025 is NordVPN. It offers 10 simultaneous connections, and while you can arguably get more for the money, you can\u2019t get better device compatibility. NordVPN isn\u2019t a one-trick pony \u2013 it\u2019s a jack of all trades and master of all!\nThis is because it offers excellent VPN clients for:\n- Computers/laptops: Windows, macOS, Linux\n- Phones/tablets: Android and iOS\n- Browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Brave, and Edge\n- Streaming devices: Fire TV Stick, Apple TV, Nvidia Shield TV, Roku, Chromecast, etc.\n- Routers: Merlin, DD-WRT, Tomato, AsusWRT, pfSense, Raspberry Pi, etc.\n- Gaming consoles: PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo.\nThe list goes on but you get the point \u2013 NordVPN is ever-present!\nProtect All Devices With NordVPN\nPros\n- Robust router support\n- 10 simultaneous connections\n- Great for Netflix libraries\n- Onion over VPN servers\n- Works in China due to obfuscation\n- Servers in 118+ countries\nCons\n- No unlimited connections\n- Some servers are slower\nWhat About Other Features?\nAs said, this best multi-device VPN hardly relies on one trick. You\u2019ll get bank-grade 256-bit encryption to ensure full identity protection on all devices. Plus, there\u2019s a Double VPN feature, which doubles your encryption to ensure you\u2019re virtually untraceable.\nNordVPN is great for watching Netflix, which explains its popularity on streaming devices. Unblocking well over 20 libraries, it\u2019s ideal for honest-to-heart streaming lovers. Besides that, NordVPN offers dedicated P2P servers, so even torrenting is on the table for all users.\nWe appreciate NordVPN\u2019s high-tech nature. By that, we mean the inclusion of Threat Protection Pro for blocking ads and malware, Meshnet for IP routing, and RAM-only servers that work in conjunction with a no-log policy to vastly improve your online privacy.\nNordVPN is easy to set up and use, making beginners feel at home.\nAdditionally, the VPN is equipped with both obfuscated and onion over VPN servers. The former servers are proven to work in China. The latter is more suited for anonymous dark web exploring, which many VPN users are interested in. Such a feature-rich package!\nHow Much Is NordVPN?\nDespite being our #1 VPN for multiple devices, NordVPN won\u2019t peel the skin off your back.\nWe ranked it as one of the least expensive VPNs in 2025 because it costs roughly $3.4/mo for the Basic plan. If you want additional security tools or NordPass and/or NordLocker, consider getting its Plus or Complete plan at under $4.4/mo and $5.4/mo respectively.\nNordVPN has a 30-day money-back guarantee, so if you\u2019re disheartened, you can be reimbursed promptly.\n2. ExpressVPN\nIf NordVPN doesn\u2019t scratch your itch, it\u2019s time for another widely adopted VPN for multiple devices \u2013 ExpressVPN. We love this one for its simplicity and some of the best-looking and best-performing apps in 2025. Better yet, ExpressVPN really works on all devices you can fathom.\n- iOS and Android tablets and phones (including Android Smart TVs)\n- Windows, Linux, and macOS computers and laptops\n- Firestick, Nvidia Shield TV, Apple TV, Roku, \u2026\n- Routers (you can also get Aircove routers from ExpressVPN)\n- Browsers (in the form of a VPN browser extension)\n- Gaming consoles (via router)\nWe can expand this list further but we\u2019d just be wasting time, as we explained all supported devices in our full ExpressVPN review. One thing to note is that ExpressVPN allows for 8 simultaneous connections and in this aspect, it\u2019s inferior to other picks on the list.\nProtect All Devices With ExpressVPN\nPros\n- Very easy to use\n- Smart DNS for streaming\n- Perfect Forward Secrecy\n- Dedicated IP addresses\n- 256-bit encryption standard\n- Torrenting is allowed on all servers\nCons\n- Limited to 8 simultaneous connections\n- Not the cheapest pick\nExpressVPN\u2019s Features\nWhat it doesn\u2019t lack is a powerful security and privacy toolkit. Like the previous VPN for multiple devices, ExpressVPN harnesses the power of 256-bit encryption, utilizing IP leak protection and a kill switch to fully conceal you. Moreover, ExpressVPN has Lightway.\nLightway is an in-house protocol molded for speed and security. To add to its value, the provider uses RAM-only servers and has Perfect Forward Secrecy, ensuring every connection gets a unique encryption key. Of course, ExpressVPN doesn\u2019t store logs, which is expected.\nBeing so simple to use, you can easily find its Threat Manager to block ads and trackers. Getting ExpressVPN also lets you get ID alerts, which will notify you of potential identity theft and prevent damage. Additionally, ExpressVPN now comes with dedicated IPs.\nIf this is insufficient, ExpressVPN supports torrenting on all servers. Plus, you can enjoy Netflix, BBC iPlayer, and other streaming services. In fact, ExpressVPN also works with Tubi TV abroad, which people frequently use for watching free movies, series, and sports streams.\nHow Much Is ExpressVPN?\nAs an extraordinary multi-device VPN, ExpressVPN\u2019s price is perhaps a tad higher.\nHowever, Gizmodo lets you in on a little secret. Using our links, you can save 61% on ExpressVPN\u2019s 2-year plan thanks to 4 free months. With the price of $4.99/mo, you can revel in this VPN\u2019s countless features risk-free for 30 days and not lose a dollar if you don\u2019t like it.\nThat outcome surely won\u2019t pan out because ExpressVPN is a true flagship VPN.\n3. Proton VPN\nThe third place is taken by Proton VPN, a provider that supports multiple devices. We won\u2019t list them, as we don\u2019t want to repeat things. However, it\u2019s worth noting that unlike the previous two, Proton VPN has a Linux GUI. It also supports routers pretty well.\nSimultaneous connections are capped at 10, which should still be enough. If you need unlimited connections, the next two VPNs are for you. For now, let\u2019s focus on Proton VPN.\nProtect All Devices With Proton VPN\nPros\n- GUI in Linux apps\n- Secure Core (MultiHop) servers\n- IPv6 leak protection\n- NetShield blocks ads and trackers\n- Free plan with unlimited bandwidth\nCons\n- No free months in the cheapest plan\n- Average customer support\nProton VPN\u2019s Features\nThe main appeal of this VPN is privacy and Proton VPN does it wonderfully well.\nIt\u2019s based in Switzerland, which lays the groundwork for a privacy-laden business model. As expected, the provider doesn\u2019t store logs and has multiple audits to prove that. It also uses physically protected servers, some of which, like Secure Core ones, are proprietary.\nTo remind you, Secure Core servers are virtually MultiHop servers owned by Proton.\nMoving on, the VPN also includes NetShield, which blocks trackers, ads, and malicious sites. This is amplified through its WireGuard implementation, which takes care of security additionally. We found Proton VPN\u2019s DNS and IPv6 leak protection very reliable.\nDuring our Proton VPN testing, our experts detected no leaks that could be privacy-endangering. On top of that, Proton VPN is suitable for streaming and has thousands of servers for torrenting. Not to mention Tor over VPN servers for dark web lowers.\nProton VPN isn\u2019t the fastest option but it\u2019s no slouch either. It\u2019s a dependable multi-device VPN, which also lets you circumvent mild censorship with Alternative Routing or stabilize the performance with its VPN Accelerator. Overall, we can\u2019t find many holes in its \u201cstory\u201d.\nHow Much Is Proton VPN?\nProton VPN\u2019s price was never the cheapest on the market but that\u2019s justified considering its attention to privacy and premium experience. The 2-year plan, which is our favorite, is $3.59/mo, while the annual plan at $3.99/mo is also an excellent option.\nProton VPN doesn\u2019t include free months on top, so it\u2019s a bit stingy compared to NordVPN or ExpressVPN\n4. Private Internet Access\nPIA VPN supports unlimited simultaneous connections, which makes it one of the best VPNs for multiple devices in 2025. If you examine its website, you\u2019ll see support for many operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux distros, Android, and iOS.\nPIA is a streaming-friendly VPN for Android TVs while also providing decent router support. The only caveat is the lack of a Firestick TV app, which, for some strange reason, isn\u2019t yet sorted out by PIA VPN\u2019s diligent team. But don\u2019t worry; PIA compensates in other aspects.\nProtect All Devices With Private Internet Access\nPros\n- Unlimited concurrent connections\n- 30,000+ global servers\n- Port forwarding\n- Dedicated US streaming servers\nCons\n- Poor Firestick TV support\n- Slightly sluggish Windows app\nPIA VPN\u2019s Features\nThe compensation takes the form of strong security and robust privacy features.\nPIA has customizable Multi-hop to bolster your encryption, while also using Shadowsocks for obfuscation. More advanced users will appreciate its port forwarding, which is a handy torrenting tool, while SOCKS5, which is also here, can be used for speed improvements.\nThe provider is based in the USA, and as a result, has servers in all states. This is complemented by other 90+ countries and about 30,000 servers globally. Many people use PIA to watch Pornhub in restricted regions or simply enjoy region-locked streaming services.\nSince it\u2019s a great VPN for all devices, PIA\u2019s features can be enjoyed on all of them. Such a feature is WireGuard whose 256-bit GCM encryption makes it very reliable. The VPN is useful for gaming as well given its low latency and fairly fast speeds across all servers.\nPrivate Internet Access doesn\u2019t lack a thing and in many instances, even works in China, which isn\u2019t the case with Proton VPN. The lack of a native Fire TV app is no big deal, either, as you can sideload the app and keep streaming without hassle.\nHow Much Is PIA VPN?\nPIA simultaneously offers unlimited connections AND the cheapest prices in 2025.\nAs much as it sounds unrealistic, the VPN\u2019s 2-year plan costs about $2.2/mo with 2 free months, resulting in an entire package costing around $57 for 26 months.\nAdd to that a 30-day refund policy and a 7-day trial on iOS/Android and you have a nearly perfect VPN that you can use on unlimited devices at a pocket change!\n5. Surfshark VPN\nSurfshark is a Dutch-based provider with innovative features, affordable plans, and a VPN for all devices. Unlike PIA, it does work with Fire TV Stick properly, offering an incredible app with Netflix-unblocking abilities. You also get unlimited concurrent connections.\nTo spice things up, Surfshark fully supports Smart DNS, offers setup guides for routers, and even works as a full-fledged VPN on various web browsers. To cut it short, it\u2019s great for multiple devices not only compatibility-wise but in terms of simultaneous connections as well.\nProtect All Devices With Surfshark\nPros\n- Affordable 2-year prices\n- IP Rotator function\n- Verified no-logging policy\n- The best option for streaming\nCons\n- No virus protection in the Starter plan\n- Occasional long connection times\nSurfshark\u2019s Features\nIts fifth spot doesn\u2019t mean Surfshark holds any punches. It\u2019s the opposite \u2013 the VPN is equipped with all the features you\u2019d expect. Some unique stuff is here, such as the IP Rotator, which rotates your IP periodically while keeping the VPN on, fending off the snoopers.\nIt also has the NoBorders mode, which obfuscates your VPN traffic to overcome censorship. That\u2019s why Surfshark is always a handy VPN for China. Another perk is privacy, where the provider\u2019s no-log policy shines backed up by RAM servers and impenetrable encryption.\nSurfshark\u2019s best characteristic is streaming and in this aspect, it\u2019s hardly beaten even by more expensive options like ExpressVPN and Proton VPN. It unblocks over 30 Netflix catalogs and works with Hulu, MAX, ABC, ESPN+, and countless other streaming platforms overseas.\nThe VPN also provides access to GPS Override, which uses fake GPS coordinates to fully conceal your location. Paying more for its mid-tier plan unlocks an antivirus plus a dark web monitor, which alleviates security risks associated with your personal information.\nHow Much Is Surfshark VPN?\nSurfshark has ample plans to pick from and almost all have some sort of discount. The monthly plan selection is there too but these deals are very pricey. We prefer its 2-year variants, where the Starter plan is $2.19/mo with an 86% discount due to 3 extra months.\nBy far the most valuable is the Surfshark One plan at $2.69/mo and 3 months on top. All plans have a 30-day money-back guarantee so that you can test the waters safely.\nAre Free Providers Multi-Device VPNs?\nLet\u2019s go back to our definition of the best VPN for multiple devices. It goes something along the lines of:\nSupporting as many devices and offering as many simultaneous connections as possible.\nLooking back on NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and other phenomenal multi-device VPNs, we can see both trends. However, if you switch to a free VPN, you\u2019ll notice a decline in both trends, particularly the second one about simultaneous connections.\nAlmost ALL free VPNs forbid them, instead, allowing you to protect only one device at a time.\nWhile they usually have support for all popular devices, that means very little if you must sign out of the VPN app on other devices to use it properly. Some free providers even go as far as not supporting some platforms \u2013 usually Linux, routers, Apple TV, Fire TV, etc.\nWe found some mobile-only VPNs as well, without a single desktop app.\nSome, on the other hand, are disguised as VPNs only to be free browser-only proxies.\nTo answer your questions, free providers are multi-device VPNs to an extent. They lack simultaneous connections and apps for more \u201cexotic\u201d devices and systems. By \u201cexotic\u201d we mean everything outside the Windows/macOS/Android/iOS circle.\nHow Did We Choose the Best VPN for Multiple Devices?\nOur methodology for this ranking was mostly reliant on compatibility but as always, we took into consideration other features. Let\u2019s precisely explain how we made this list:\n- Compatibility (30%)\n- Security and privacy (25%)\n- Day-to-day Performance (20%)\n- Affordability (15%)\n- Ease of use (10%)\nAs you can see, compatibility, security, and privacy were our top criteria.\nThe first one needs no explanation \u2013 look at the multi-device VPN definition above.\nThe second, which is security/privacy, is important for a VPN because most people. That\u2019s one of the main purposes of a VPN, after all. You\u2019ll see that our top picks all have impenetrable security and no-logs policies with at least one third-party audit.\nDay-to-day performance isn\u2019t only about speed. All VPNs have beefy 10 Gbps servers and perform like champs. It\u2019s also about streaming, torrenting, and other activities we do daily. These multi-device VPNs are competent enough to satisfy you in these fields.\nAffordability is a key aspect \u2013 you don\u2019t want to overpay and STILL have a VPN for all devices. Well, NordVPN is a perfect example of this and so is Surfshark, with its record-breaking low prices, apps for all devices, and unlimited simultaneous connections.\nEase of use was our least important deciding factor. All VPNs are fairly easy to use, endorsing one-click connections and easy navigation across all systems. You have to be blind or ignorant not to figure out how to use these apps in the first 10 or so minutes.\nWhat Are Simultaneous Connections?\nOne term frequently mentioned in the VPN world is \u201csimultaneous connections\u201c.\nWe feel the need to explain it and see what VPN providers mean by it. So, first of all, in most cases, simultaneous connections mean the number of allowed ACTIVE connections to a VPN server at a time. We\u2019ll take NordVPN as an example, with 10 allowed connections.\nThis provider lets you install the VPN on as many devices as you want without issues.\nHowever, if 11 or more devices try to connect simultaneously, only 10 will be able to connect, while the rest will see an error. That said, you can have 10 active connections at a time. In the case of CyberGhost, which isn\u2019t mentioned here, operates a bit differently.\nThis VPN allows for 7 connections but in reality, we can call them 7 sign-ins.\nIf you simply sign in to the app on more than 7 devices, CyberGhost will warn you to sign out of the app on other devices to be able to use it. This is an exception, though, as pretty much all other VPNs operate as explained with NordVPN\u2019s example.\nConclusion\nA safe and reliable VPN for multiple devices is simultaneously useful for families and large social circles with increased needs for privacy, security, streaming, and other popular VPN benefits. Our researchers have dug out the five most amazing options in 2025.\nWhile all of them support pretty much every device, you\u2019ll have a different number of simultaneous connections. That number goes from 8 to unlimited, and while 8 seems small, it\u2019s usually more than sufficient for single users or those looking for a family VPN.\nStill, we left two simultaneous connection VPNs, such as PIA and Surfshark, in case you have more \u201cextreme\u201d needs. To digress, NordVPN is the best pick in all aspects but if you\u2019re keen on experimenting, you can try all of them risk-free for 30 days before you settle for one."

      "text": "Many cybersecurity enthusiasts yearn for a quality VPN for the United States. After all, it\u2019s the largest VPN market with plenty of people trying to avoid ISP monitoring, copyright trolls, and geo-blocks. Well, if you\u2019re after the best US VPN in 2025, you\u2019re in the right place.\nWhether you\u2019re in the USA or abroad, using a VPN with US servers goes a long way in ensuring your privacy and security. Such a service can obfuscate your IP address, making you untraceable by snoopers. Another benefit is accessing restricted websites.\nGetting a US IP address grants access to American Netflix and other TV channels. In addition, this service\u2019s privacy lets you download torrents in P2P with top-tier performance. Unfortunately, this is true only for the best-rated VPNs in the United States.\nNot all providers are equal and some are far less impressive. In this guide, we\u2019ll avoid the latter and focus on the creme de la creme options. Also, our favorite picks are perfectly usable in the USA and abroad for people who want an American IP address. Read on.\nBest US VPN: Our 6 Favorite VPNs Usable in the USA & Abroad\nAs we focus on the top-tier layer of the VPN market, all providers will be paid. We, however, have a separate guide with free US VPNs that you can check out. Don\u2019t be too excited because non-paid options are far less reliable.\nNow, where were we? Oh, yes!\nThese are the most reliable providers in and out of the United States, tested and reviewed by our cybersecurity experts:\n- NordVPN \u2013 the #1 rated US VPN overall\n- ExpressVPN \u2013 fast and secure VPN to use in the USA\n- Private Internet Access \u2013 the best American VPN with servers in all 51 states\n- Proton VPN \u2013 supreme privacy and security for everyone\n- Surfshark \u2013 great for unlimited simultaneous connections\n- CyberGhost \u2013 dedicated US-based VPN servers for streaming\nAre you interested in finding out more about all of these providers before you take a pick? That\u2019s a smart decision. Let\u2019s see what makes each provider so awesome and dependable.\n1. NordVPN\nPros\n- 2,000 US servers\n- It unblocks Netflix US and Prime Video\n- Threat Protection Pro on all devices\n- Dedicated P2P servers anonymize torrenting\n- NordLynx is the fastest protocol we tested\n- Built-in connection obfuscation\nCons\n- Monthly plans aren\u2019t discounted\n- Price increase when renewing\nNordVPN is the most popular VPN in the USA because of its versatility. If you\u2019re in the United States, you can enjoy countless servers abroad. If you\u2019re overseas, NordVPN has around 2,000 servers in multiple American states. This makes it a perfect choice for both sides.\nApart from that, NordVPN excels in every way. It\u2019s equipped with bank-grade encryption, Double VPN servers, and even a two-level automatic kill switch. There\u2019s another feature \u2013 Threat Protection Pro \u2013 which keeps you safe from malware, trackers, and ads.\nWe love NordVPN\u2019s Meshnet, which US VPN users can enjoy directly from the app. It\u2019s great for hosting LAN parties for gaming or remote file-sharing with utmost security. NordVPN\u2019s no-log policy ensures your browsing activities and IP address are never stored.\nWe should also point out its P2P servers. Being the best VPN for America, NordVPN lets you torrent privately to avoid DMCA notices and copyright trolls. Very beneficial for people in the United States. NordVPN also offers built-in obfuscated servers to circumvent firewalls.\nIf you\u2019re wondering about streaming, let us bear good news. This amazing VPN for the US works with American Netflix and around 20 other catalogs. Its high-speed NordLynx protocol provides exceptional stability, letting you watch even 4K movies and shows without a hitch.\nFinally, NordVPN works on all devices, making it suitable for everyone. You\u2019ll be more than happy with 10 concurrent connections, 24/7 support, and above all, incredibly affordable prices. How affordable is it? Less than $3.2 a month if you choose the Basic 2-year plan.\nOther plans are pretty inexpensive for what they offer. We encourage you to explore them below.\n2. ExpressVPN\nPros\n- 24+ VPN locations in the US\n- No-logging policy\n- Network Lock (kill switch)\n- Fast speeds for streaming and P2P\n- RAM-based servers\n- Advanced Protection\nCons\n- It\u2019s not very affordable\n- Double VPN servers aren\u2019t available\nExpressVPN is a premium VPN to use in the USA or abroad. With its 3,000+ servers and 24+ US VPN locations, you\u2019re all set for ultimate enjoyment. This provider\u2019s speeds are amazing thanks to its Lightway protocols and robust 10 Gbps servers around the world.\nIn addition, we found this VPN suitable for all activities. P2P is fast and safe, streaming is possible on a variety of services, including 15+ Netflix catalogs, and gaming is without latency. This, combined with ExpressVPN\u2019s \u201csafety\u201d side of things, makes it very popular.\nYou see, ExpressVPN has over 18 third-party audits from security firms like Cure53, PwC, KPMG, and others. This has to do with its crystal-clear no-log policy and the use of RAM servers, both of which ensure your data NEVER lingers in ExpressVPN\u2019s hands.\nAdditionally, people will find its in-app features quite handy. There\u2019s Advanced Protection with Parental Control for blocking ads, trackers, and porn sites. You\u2019ll also find the Network Lock kill switch, which protects against IP leaks, plus split tunneling for added customization.\nExpressVPN lacks Double VPN connections, which is a minor downside. The silver lining is its ExpressVPN Keys password manager which you can use for free for added password security. This VPN works in the USA and overseas perfectly on all devices, with added router support.\nIts 8 simultaneous connections will suffice if you want to protect all your devices. Unfortunately, as it\u2019s one of the best-rated US VPNs, it\u2019s not the cheapest. At least you can lower the price by 61% thanks to 4 free months for its 2-year plan by using the button below.\n3. Private Internet Access\nPros\n- Servers in all American states\n- Unlimited concurrent connections\n- 500 GB pCloud storage for free in every plan\n- WireGuard & OpenVPN protocols\n- Dedicated IP addresses\nCons\n- No app for Fire TV Stick\n- It works with only a few Netflix catalogs\nPIA VPN is quite a popular option in the USA. It\u2019s very interesting because it offers servers in ALL 50 American states, making it perfect for obtaining a US IP address. If you\u2019re in the United States, don\u2019t worry because you get 30,000+ servers in 90+ countries. Impressive numbers!\nThis massive VPN for the USA doesn\u2019t skimp on anything. Users can enjoy unlimited concurrent connections while not breaking the bank. It costs just around $2 a month for the 2-year plan with 2 or 4 free months. With this money, you\u2019re getting everything you need.\nStarting with streaming and torrenting \u2013 everything will work. PIA works with Netflix USA and offers superb P2P support with port forwarding. A great addition is MACE, a feature that prevents ads and malicious sites from harming you. PIA also has WireGuard.\nThis protocol ensures proper stability and speeds needed for daily use. Our tests of PIA showed that it reaches 250+ Mbps in speed, which isn\u2019t to be neglected. Security-wise, you can use this great VPN for the USA without worrying about data leaks and other fluff.\nIt uses 256-bit encryption with IPv6 leak protection to keep your privacy intact. Its app also contains MultiHop + Obfuscation, helping you bypass censorship in a blink. PIA comes with the SOCKS5 proxy too but users can optionally get a dedicated IP address for cheap.\nLike CyberGhost, which we\u2019ll mention later, it offers antivirus for around $1.5 a month. Not to mention that every plan you choose comes with 500 GB of free cloud storage from pCloud. This means you\u2019re getting the safest VPN for the USA plus the best cloud storage provider for a measly $2 or so a month.\n4. Proton VPN\nPros\n- Strong privacy and security features\n- It has a free plan with unlimited bandwidth\n- 10 simultaneous connections\n- Great for streaming\nCons\n- No Smart DNS\n- Speeds could be better\nProton VPN resides in Switzerland, so it\u2019s far from the USA. Yet, with its 9,940+ servers and 2,600+ in the USA, it\u2019s a great option to have. Proton VPN is famous for its Secure Core servers that enhance your encryption and privacy to deter snoopers and hackers.\nAnother benefit is NetShield, which not only blocks ads but also keeps tracking and malicious sites at bay. Proton VPN uses several types of dedicated servers to add a bit of variety. It directly supports Tor Over VPN connections \u2013 great for dark web users.\nThen, you have streaming and torrenting support, which one of the best VPNs for the USA must possess. Our team likes its VPN Accelerator which boosts the performance a bit, but alas, not by a lot. This can be remedied by using some of the fastest VPNs we tested.\nThis provider\u2019s Swiss jurisdiction grants users an immense feeling of privacy and seclusion. The provider doesn\u2019t store ANY logs and uses RAM servers to prevent data from accumulating. Every server restart wipes all information, keeping a clean slate all the time.\nProton VPN works on all devices and we found its 10 simultaneous connections more than suitable in most cases. Interestingly, this is the only provider on the list with a free VPN that can be used forever with unlimited bandwidth. However, the premium VPN is slightly pricey.\nProton priced its VPN service so that it costs around $3 a month for the 2-year plan. This is pretty much 1.5 times more than PIA but with no free months on top. For this reason, Proton VPN isn\u2019t the #1-rated VPN for the USA despite its more than obvious qualities.\n5. Surfshark\nPros\n- Unlimited bandwidth\n- 600+ servers in the USA\n- One of the best options for streaming\n- Very affordable 2-year plans\nCons\n- Kill switch issues in the past\n- It takes a while to connect on Windows\n- Monthly plans are expensive\nSurfshark is no slouch compared to the other best US VPNs on the list. However, it took this place because of occasional kill switch problems and slower connection speeds. Other than that, Surfshark devours security problems and geo-blocks like a dead-hungry shark.\nWith over 3,200 servers around the world, this provider has you covered in the USA or abroad. It has 10+ US VPN locations, all capable of unblocking US-based content and platforms like ESPN+, Netflix, Sling TV, MAX, and dozens more.\nSurfshark\u2019s app is filled with P2P-friendly servers that you can use for torrenting or simply seeding torrent files. We like its no-quibble approach, with excellent features like MultiHop, which doubles your encryption, and even NoBorders, which adds obfuscation.\nOur team listed Surfshark as one of the favorite USA VPNs because of its IP Rotation feature. It rotates your IP periodically while keeping your connection intact, to prevent ISPs and hackers from tracking your activities. The best-value VPN deal is its One+ plan.\nThis one offers a capable antivirus for ALL devices, along with a Search browser for kinky searches without anyone\u2019s notice. Surfshark has unlimited bandwidth and connections, which is handy considering its overwhelming device compatibility. Even Smart DNS is there.\nThe VPN doesn\u2019t store logs either, which has been proven in several third-party audits. Surfshark is a complete package whose price never goes above a few monthly dollars. When you factor in the discount you can get on our site, things get a lot more interesting\u2026\n6. CyberGhost\nPros\n- Torrenting/streaming servers\n- 200+ Mbps tested speeds with WireGuard\n- Split tunneling\n- It doesn\u2019t store traffic logs\nCons\n- Obfuscation is unavailable\n- Not many simultaneous connections (7)\n- OpenVPN performance is subpar\nCyberGhost is an incredible VPN for the US if you don\u2019t want to spend much. It doesn\u2019t have a load of advanced features like NordVPN but still manages to be very efficient. For instance, it offers servers dedicated to torrenting and streaming on different platforms.\nYou can, for example, connect to a US VPN server for Netflix or ABC. After that, go to the respective site and enjoy streaming. Its P2P servers span more than 70 countries, making it easy to find the fastest one and download torrents at full speed (up to 200+ Mbps in our tests).\nCyberGhost\u2019s desktop apps offer access to NoSpy servers. They\u2019re operated directly by the VPN \u2013 not rented \u2013 which ensures another thick privacy layer. CyberGhost is based in Romania, so you can expect no logging of your IP address and traffic history.\nWe\u2019ll also highlight its implementation of RAM-only servers and Private DNS, adding to the sense of privacy. CyberGhost uses OpenVPN and WireGuard protocols aided by AES-256 encryption, DNS leak prevention, and domain-level split tunneling.\nBe aware that CyberGhost lacks obfuscation, so it won\u2019t work for bypassing censorship. However, if you need a great VPN to use in the United States, that won\u2019t matter much. CyberGhost offers the same optional extras as PIA. This means you can get an antivirus if you want.\nSadly, it\u2019s capped at just 7 simultaneous connections, so it\u2019s unimpressive compared to NordVPN\u2019s 10 or PIA\u2019s unlimited connections. CyberGhost\u2019s 45-day refund policy sounds awesome, though, and users can freely test it for 24 hours on Windows without paying.\nWhy Do I Need a VPN in the USA?\nWhile we don\u2019t think VPNs are necessary, we can all agree they improve your internet experience quite a lot. Of course, this is true only if you pick a reputable service and do not go for an \u201cobscure\u201d provider with shady business practices.\nLet\u2019s discuss some of the most prevalent reasons for using a VPN in America.\nPrivacy\nBy far the biggest reason to use a VPN in the US is privacy. We all know America as the bastion of freedom, diversity, and whatnot. Well, that\u2019s the case only on the surface. Underneath, you\u2019re looking at the government that doesn\u2019t shy away from surveillance.\nYes, this is a founding member of the 5 Eyes Alliance. For those unfamiliar, the 5 Eyes Alliance is a conglomeration of English-speaking countries (5 of them) that employ nationwide surveillance and data collection. This is what\u2019s going on in the background.\nThe authorities request the ISPs to monitor your activities and log your data. This data is then distributed to the authorities who can do with it whatever they want. Allegedly, it\u2019s for your safety but we don\u2019t think they need THAT much information to keep you safe.\nA VPN that focuses on privacy can greatly reduce data collection and surveillance. By obfuscating your IP address and encrypting your connection, everything you do online will be unknown to your ISP. A connection becomes a garbled mess of letters and characters.\nThis is what encryption does to your traffic. Next time you connect to the internet, enable one of our recommended VPNs in the USA to stop your ISP in its tracks. From this point on, you can surf the internet and enjoy your peace of mind that otherwise wouldn\u2019t exist.\nUnblocking Websites\nWe know that websites like Netflix, MAX, Hulu, Prime Video, and many more work in the USA.\nSo why would you want a VPN service for this country? Well, if you want to watch BBC iPlayer, Hotstar, or different Netflix/Prime Video libraries, think again.\nNot all content is in America. Many great movies, series, and sites are available ONLY outside your country. This calls for an IP change with a VPN that can effortlessly bypass geo-blocks and bring you closer to the content you want. People also use this service for gambling sites, altering their IP to bet online on websites that are unavailable in their country.\nFurthermore, with more and more states passing laws to enforce age verification for visitors to adult websites (which is great news for child protection!), some people are now seeking to bypass restrictions on Pornhub from states like Florida, Texas, and Nebraska\u2026\nTo be clear, you can use this benefit outside the USA. If you\u2019re on vacation, it\u2019s easy to change your IP address to America and watch ABC, ESPN, Peacock TV, and other stuff.\nTorrenting\nOkay, so torrenting is a sensitive topic in the United States. You\u2019ve heard about DMCA notices, copyright trolls, and a generally unfavorable \u201catmosphere\u201d surrounding P2P. Torrenting isn\u2019t illegal in this country as long as you\u2019re downloading non-copyrighted files.\nWe all make mistakes and if you accidentally do that, expect to face consequences at some point. ISP monitoring will take care of that, as the ISP sees this activity, reports you to the copyright holder unbeknownst to you, and you\u2019re ready to be roasted when the time comes.\nThis \u201croasting\u201d can be a hefty fine for stolen property i.e. a song, movie, video game, etc. Even abroad, you want to safeguard your torrenting with a VPN. Torrenting isn\u2019t safe and P2P sharing means divulging your IP address to other users \u2013 including torrent sites.\nTorrent sites can also collect your download history and hand it out to the authorities upon request. We don\u2019t advocate downloading copyrighted files but we\u2019re all for hiding your online activities with a reliable VPN for the USA when performing P2P file sharing.\nDoing so will keep you safe during downloading and prevent unwanted problems down the line.\nWhat Is the Fastest VPN for the US?\nAll providers on our list are famous for being fast and reliable. That\u2019s due to factors like:\n- Cutting-edge protocols (NordLynx, Lightway, WireGuard)\n- 10 Gbps servers\n- Lots of server locations\nThese three are usually telltale signs you\u2019ll get a fast VPN for streaming, gaming, downloading, browsing, and everything else. However, as said, at the start, not all providers are made equal and some prioritize speed more than others.\n| Avg Download Speed Loss | Avg Upload Speed Loss | |\n| NordVPN | 18% | 7% |\n| ExpressVPN | 24% | 9% |\n| PIA VPN | 26% | 24% |\n| Proton VPN | 27% | 32% |\n| Surfshark | 42% | 16% |\n| CyberGhost | 44% | 22% |\nThe table above shows you the percentage of speed loss in our best US VPN providers. As you can see, NordVPN is the fastest VPN you can use in the USA in 2025, closely followed by ExpressVPN. When it comes to budget options, PIA is also a great one.\nBear in mind we performed these tests using several virtual locations; the UK, the USA, and Japan. These results present average speed losses based on these three countries. We were in Southeastern Europe during testing, with 320 Mbps and 20 Mbps native download and upload speeds respectively.\nAre VPNs Legal in the United States?\nVery few things are illegal in the US and VPNs aren\u2019t one of them. Besides, many VPN services are based in the United States, including PIA, IPVanish, Betternet, and at least 10 more. This means this service is perfectly fine to use for legal things.\nLegal \u201cthings\u201d are also watching pornography anonymously, browsing safely, and torrenting (non-copyrighted files!). Now, there are instances in which you can go to the other side of the law. If you use this service to sell copyrighted content, buy/sell drugs, or anything illicit, that\u2019s another story. Not a happy one indeed!\nWhile VPNs can, for good or bad, also conceal these activities, they shouldn\u2019t be abused. Just because someone can\u2019t see you\u2019re doing something bad, it doesn\u2019t mean you should do it. It\u2019s worth noting that unblocking some sites this way is also against the \u201crules.\u201d\nNetflix has an anti-VPN policy that restricts using these services to access its content. However, while this is against terms and conditions, it\u2019s not against the law and won\u2019t get you in jail. To cut things short, using a VPN in the US \u201cnormally\u201d is fair and legal.\nIt won\u2019t get you arrested, fined, killed, or whatever. Go ahead and use one and in the meantime, inform yourself about the legality of the VPN around the world.\nConclusion\nHave you just scrolled down without reading the entire guide? We forgive you if you were too busy but not if you were too lazy! All jokes aside, this is the end of our ranking of the best and most impressive VPNs for the USA, usable in and outside of this country.\nNordVPN is likely going to be the top pick for many, with ExpressVPN and PIA being two awesome alternatives if you find it lacking. Proton VPN, Surfshark, and CyberGhost are in the B-Tier, as less impressive but with great features like unlimited connections and no logging.\nWith these 6 choices, you\u2019re ready to take on the world. Pick one \u2013 the time has come."

      "text": "Before buying this service, it\u2019s smart to stay with us until our Surfshark VPN review ends. This is quite an interesting VPN provider with strong privacy, a wealth of security features, and good-looking apps for all your devices. Above everything, it\u2019s pretty affordable.\nIts start was rough. With a smaller server park and subpar performance, Surfshark couldn\u2019t compete with NordVPN and ExpressVPN a few years ago. However, a surge of improvements \u201cflooded\u201d the VPN recently, skyrocketing it almost at the top of the best VPN charts.\nIn our Surfshark VPN test, we\u2019ll see why this provider might be a good option even for more demanding users. As with any other VPN we tested, we used Surfshark from its inception in 2018, so we\u2019re acquainted with how it works, what it offers, and what it fails to offer.\nPutting it simply, this is a first-hand, in-depth review of Surfshark \u2014 that much you know. But you don\u2019t know one thing yet, and that\u2019s the precise level of quality this service provides. You\u2019ll have to read further for this valuable information.\nSurfshark\nSurfshark displayed excellent overall performance, strong security and privacy, inexpensive 24-month plans, and dazzling streaming abilities. It's not perfect, though, as it can be a bit slower, with pricier-than-usual monthly plans.\nPros\n- MultiHop servers\n- Unlimited simultaneous connections\n- Certified no-logging policy\n- Works with 30+ Netflix libraries\n- Amazing Antivirus\n- Discounts for 2-year and 1-year plans\nCons\n- Slow upload speeds\n- Based in the Netherlands (9 Eyes)\n- Costly 1-month plans (up to $20/mo)\nSurfshark VPN Pricing: How Much Does It Cost?\nOur Surfshark analysis begins with the price review. We love how generous this provider is, despite the costly improvements it made recently. Like CyberGhost or even PIA, the service has an almost fixed price that never fluctuates dramatically.\nAt the time of doing this review, Surfshark offers a staggering Starter deal at just under $2 a month with 3 EXTRA months. The Surfshark One is the best value in our book, as it offers advanced features that we\u2019ll discuss later in the test.\nIts price isn\u2019t too high either, at a speck under $2.7 a month for the 2-year plan. We finally have the One+ plan, also with 3 months, that includes features from Incogni (just like NordVPN). For more info, refer to our NordVPN test or keep reading this review.\nAn amazing thing about this VPN is that even short-term plans are discounted! If you want to commit to a year, good. The Starter plan is, in this case, under $2.20/mo with 3 extra months, which is easily the cheapest annual VPN deal we\u2019ve ever seen. Good job.\nUnfortunately, Surfshark\u2019s monthly plans are overwhelmingly expensive. The Starter plan is nearly $16, while the One+ plan is under $18 \u2014 far more than NordVPN\u2019s equivalents.\nTo ensure you don\u2019t miss out on the latest promotions, check out our list of the most recent coupons and deals for Surfshark VPN.\nMoney-Back Guarantee and Free Trial\nGenerosity starts with a risk-free purchase, hence the inclusion of a 30-day money-back guarantee. Like the competitors we mentioned above, the provider guarantees that you\u2019ll get a refund in the first 30 days if you want it. For whatever reason, as well.\nYou can test the service, and if you don\u2019t like its speed, for instance, be reimbursed. Surfshark VPN is easygoing and issues a refund the same day \u2014 again, props to that. When it comes to the free plan, the provider offers none. It would be unfair given its already silly price.\nHowever, a free trial can be obtained through your iOS or Android device. It\u2019s a 7-day trial, after which, you\u2019re immediately charged the renewal price, not the discounted one. That said, if you\u2019re up for a trial, we recommend canceling it before the first 7 days expire.\nAfter that, go back to our Surfshark VPN review and grab a discount using our links.\nPayment Methods\nIf you\u2019re hell-bent on getting this service, you can pay for it however you want. Currently, available payment vendors include:\n- PayPal\n- Credit and debit cards\n- Google Pay\n- Apple Pay\n- Cryptocurrency\nWe think this is more than enough, especially with the addition of crypto for anonymous purchases. The provider uses CoinGate, which, from our experience, is a safe crypto payment vendor through which you can also get a refund in this case. Some providers lack a refund policy for crypto payments.\nEase of Use & Compatibility\nAesthetics and ease of use are Surfshark\u2019s strengths. As you see below, its apps look beautiful and resemble the same \u201cfeel\u201d on all supported platforms. Additionally, the provider is simple to set up and offers a heap of native apps for different devices.\nSpeaking of that, Surfshark VPN doesn\u2019t bring anything new to the table but in a good way. It\u2019s the same as our number-one VPN, NordVPN, or another fan-favorite, ExpressVPN.\nThis translates to amazing device compatibility that makes Surfshark usable on:\n- Mac, Linux, and Windows laptops and computers\n- Android and iOS smartphones and tablets\n- Streaming devices such as Smart TVs, and Android TVs (including Nvidia Shield TV, Firestick, Apple TV, Chromecast, \u2026)\n- Gaming consoles, routers, Raspberry Pi, Oculus Quest 2\n- Web browsers such as Chrome, Brave, Edge, and Firefox\nEven better, Surfshark supports unlimited simultaneous connections. This isn\u2019t dictated by the plan you choose. Even monthly or 1-year plans allow you to protect as many devices as you want. We always appreciate this feature because it can make the VPN almost free.\nYou can split the price of the subscription with a few friends or family members. The price of $2 or so a month quickly becomes $0.5 or so monthly for each of you. Compatibility-wise, we\u2019re sure you won\u2019t have any issues.\nSecurity Features of Surfshark: Is It Safe to Use?\nIn this Surfshark review for 2025, we must answer an important question \u2014 is the provider secure enough?\nWell, based on our few years of experience at this point, we can confidently nod our heads in approval but still, let us tell you more about all of its numerous features.\nBasic VPN Features\nWe\u2019ll start with basic features that represent the backbone of almost every VPN service.\nThey include:\n- Military-Grade Encryption. Surfshark employs 256-bit AES encryption to keep your online identity and activities untraceable. It\u2019s a basic but cutting-edge feature, as we\u2019re talking about the highest encryption level possible.\n- VPN Kill Switch. Some time ago, this was Surfshark\u2019s Achilles heel. The provider\u2019s kill switch tended to stop working occasionally, exposing users\u2019 IP addresses. However, drawing from our experience, this isn\u2019t the case anymore, and in 2025, everything works fine, even though we haven\u2019t had many connection problems.\n- Bypasser. An alternative name for split tunneling. One of our favorite features because it lets you determine which apps and/or websites to route through or bypass the VPN tunnel. NordVPN and ExpressVPN offer App Split Tunneling only, and as you see, Surfshark goes a step further with the Domain (Website) Split Tunneling on top.\n- CleanWeb. It works only when the VPN is connected and blocks trackers, malware, and ads. Sadly, blocked threats aren\u2019t listed for further identification, as is the case with NordVPN\u2019s Threat Protection Pro.\n- WireGuard/OpenVPN Protocols. The VPN offers WireGuard as the faster option and OpenVPN as a tad slower protocol. After trying out both, we ended up preferring the former. Either way, there\u2019s nothing special here, as neither of them is customizable like with PIA. By the way, you can read our PIA review here if you\u2019re interested in a slightly more affordable VPN service.\nAdvanced Security Features\nYou wouldn\u2019t expect such a large number of advanced security features from a cheap VPN like Surfshark. We\u2019re all wrong sometimes, except when we\u2019re right.\nHere\u2019s a comprehensive review of all advanced security features from our Surfshark test.\nNoBorders\nLet\u2019s start with NoBorders, one of the trademark features of this provider. It\u2019s easy to use and requires you to toggle a switch in the app to make it work. NoBorders is obfuscation, which allows the provider to work in censored regions. You\u2019ll see our test of it later in the Surfshark review.\nTo explain how it works, it masks your VPN traffic and makes it look like a normal one. As a result, the service bypasses firewalls and allows you to use the internet freely. Spoiler alert \u2014 it works in China! But as said, you\u2019ll find a more in-depth analysis of this feature later on.\nMultiHop + Rotating IP\nLike NordVPN, PIA, and countless other providers, Surfshark offers MultiHop. This is easily one of our most beloved features because it doubles your encryption by routing your traffic through two servers in different countries. This makes it impossible to track you online.\nIn our Surfshark test, this feature was better than expected, with stellar performance and only a minor speed drop. Best of all, it\u2019s customizable, so you can choose the entry and exit server. You can\u2019t do this in NordVPN and its pre-determined server location pairs.\nTo be clear, Surfshark has these pairs too but if you click on \u201cCreate Connection\u201c, you can cherry-pick two countries, pair them, and you\u2019re done. Another feature worth mentioning is the Rotating IP. It\u2019s, at first, similar to MultiHop because it rotates your IP periodically.\nHowever, Surfshark\u2019s technology allows you to periodically rotate your IP while keeping your online location the same and without losing the connection! This is impossible with a traditional IP change and is unique to this service.\nRotate IP addresses with Surfshark\nSurfshark Alert\nNow, we move on to the features available in the One plan, which is our recommended option. The Started plan includes all of the features from above but not this and the next three features mentioned in the Surfshark review.\nFor us, this was always a handy feature to keep up with potential email breaches. It\u2019s the same feature as the Dark Web Monitor from NordVPN. The Alert tool scans your email, finds breaches, and informs you of them in your account dashboard on the website.\nThe service can also monitor your credit cards and IDs to prevent unauthorized access. Of course, if you want to minimize your exposure and don\u2019t want the provider to keep an eye on your sensitive data, all of it can be instantly deleted forever.\nAntivirus\nWe also liked the Antivirus that this provider offers. It\u2019s an in-app add-on and works like any other antivirus. The tool scans your computer for threats and informs you if any of them will endanger your device. A huge advantage is a frequent database update.\nSurfshark updates its threat database every few hours, which is typical only for top-tier antivirus software. As you can see in the screenshot, we tested the Antivirus and found no threats \u2014 thank God! This Antivirus offers a few additional options.\nFor one, there\u2019s real-time protection that instantly eliminates viruses upon detection. Web protection is a nifty little tool that prevents malicious downloads. The Antivirus can perform a full or quick scan of your device to find even the most stubborn threats.\nOverall, our experience with this VPN and antivirus combo was extremely pleasant.\nSearch (Private Browser)\nPeople who often watch porn switch to the Incognito mode without knowing that it\u2019s still traceable by their ISP (Internet Service Provider).\nWell, Surfshark came up with its Search browser that offers untraceable, completely anonymous browsing, allowing you to revel in all the privacy.\nYou can use it straight from the app by typing in the search query. The new tab will then open in your browser where you can start using the internet in complete privacy. This, in conjunction with the VPN enabled, will make you a ghost online.\nAlternative ID\nAfter trying out Alternative ID, we couldn\u2019t help but notice this feature\u2019s greatness. It lets you create a fake identity and go online as a different person. Users can manually create their credentials or let Surfshark craft their \u201cAlt Persona\u201d to fend off data brokers and advertisers.\nWe tried this feature multiple times and honestly, had a good laugh on more than a few occasions. Above, you can see what the provider created for us. We became Luciano Danilo Santos in a second, with a new birth date, gender, country, and state.\nWith this \u201cAlt Persona\u201d, Surfshark also supplied us with the corresponding email that we could use on different sites that require this kind of information. So, instead of our private email address, we could use this one, which was pretty handy in many scenarios.\nIncogni\nIncogni can also be found in NordVPN, which we clarified at the start of our Surfshark review. It lets you request the deletion of your private data by \u201cforcing\u201d data brokers to remove it from their databases.\nThe feature works in the UK, the US, Switzerland, Canada, and the EU. It\u2019s part of the Surfshark One+ subscription, so it might not fit your budget. However, it works with dozens of popular data brokers and is effective at wiping many traces of your online presence.\nRAM Servers\nAll of the provider\u2019s servers are based on RAM or Random Access Memory. RAM is volatile memory that loses all data with the power loss. This guarantees that each server restart wipes all information and prevents unwanted logging that either way, isn\u2019t happening.\nHowever, hosting servers on RAM allows for better performance, easier software updates, and simpler maintenance. It\u2019s a huge advantage for large providers that need to keep everything under control at any moment.\nIP and DNS Leak Test: No Leaks Detected\nOur IP and DNS leak test was pretty successful. We tested many of Surfshark\u2019s server locations with incredible results. However, for the sake of simplicity, we\u2019ll show you our test results while using the American VPN server.\nThe first testing ground was ipleak.net.\nThis website inspected our connection for IP and DNS leaks, only to find none. Below are our test results from browserleaks.com \u2014 another popular leak tester.\nAgain, you see no leaks of our IP/DNS from Belgrade (our location at the time of writing the review). As expected, the provider\u2019s security is strong enough to let you soar the web privately and without compromises, which we always appreciate.\nDoes Surfshark VPN Keep Logs?\nWe\u2019ll answer this question right away \u2014 no, it doesn\u2019t. Surfshark\u2019s jurisdiction was the British Virgin Islands, just like ExpressVPN. However, a few years ago, the provider shifted to the Netherlands, right into the very handy of the 14 Eyes region.\nMany users were dismayed, as the Dutch jurisdiction isn\u2019t exactly screaming privacy. Yet, shortly after moving to the Netherlands, the VPN received an independent audit on its no-log policy, which cemented its place as one of the safest providers around.\nAn interesting fact is that Surfshark joined forces with NordVPN. NordVPN isn\u2019t its owner. These are still different companies but they work together to make improvements on both services. This is why they offer some similar or even identical features like Incogni.\nOf course, NordVPN is better but this collaboration brought Surfshark to a much higher level too. Besides, privacy-wise, it\u2019s good to know that the company works with a VPN giant like NordVPN. At least in our eyes, this makes the Dutch provider a tad more trustworthy.\nSurfshark\u2019s Privacy Policy Review\nYou don\u2019t have to dig deep to gain information about the provider\u2019s logging practices. In this Surfshark review, we\u2019ll mention that the service stores no logs of your:\n- IP address\n- Browsing history\n- Consumed bandwidth\n- Network traffic\n- DNS queries\nAs this information isn\u2019t stored on its servers, we can immediately conclude this is a true no-log policy. However, every provider requires some information to work and this one is no different. Two bits of information are crucial \u2014 email information and basic billing info.\nThe VPN can\u2019t work without these two. On the technical front, the provider collects a small batch of information, such as:\n- Aggregated anonymous performance data\n- The frequency of use of the service\n- App crash reports\n- Unsuccessful connection attempts\nAs you see, it\u2019s basic information that can lead Surfshark or any other entity back to you. Technical data like this is a MUST for server maintenance and future improvements, plus, it\u2019s in an anonymized form and is wiped clean with each server restart thanks to RAM servers.\nOther services like Alert or Antivirus require more information to function. Don\u2019t fret. If you want to stop using them, you can do so and all collected information will be deleted forever. This, for instance, applies to Alert which monitors your email address.\nOnce you stop using it, your email is deleted and lost to oblivion.\nThird-Party Audits\nAs an acclaimed cheap VPN, Surfshark underwent a few independent security audits. The first was in 2021, just 3 years after the official first release. Cure53 inspected and audited its server infrastructure, which was a major confidence boost for the company.\nAt the start of 2023, Surfshark underwent another evaluation, as its no-logs statements were tested by Deloitte. For the second time, claims were confirmed and the provider\u2019s no-log claims were bolstered further.\nAt the end of 2023, the company received a MASA certificate.\nMASA stands for Mobile App Security Assessment. It\u2019s a test performed on mobile apps to determine if they\u2019re safe enough. Needless to say, iOS and Android apps passed the analysis with flying colors, which was followed by yet another valuable certificate.\nSurfshark Review: Server Locations\nBack in the day, the provider worked with around 1,000+ servers in less than 50-60 locations. In 2025, the company takes itself more seriously, improving and expanding its network to 3,200+ servers in 100 countries. Nowadays, it\u2019s almost on par with ExpressVPN.\nThe server network is, as said, hosted on RAM and contains 10 Gbps ports for the best performance. All server locations are WireGuard-friendly, plus, all can be used within Surfshark\u2019s browser extension (read more about the most reliable VPNs for Chrome).\nIts server distribution is excellent, with servers across all continents \u2014 except for Antarctica. For added variety, the provider includes Static IP addresses in the Netherlands, the UK, Singapore, Japan, the US, and Germany.\nMoreover, Surfshark offers Dedicated IP addresses in around 12 locations. This is far less than PIA and its Dedicated IPs are on the expensive side. At 3.75/mo, it\u2019s more expensive than PIA\u2019s $2.5/mo per Dedicated IP.\nWe\u2019re pretty satisfied with the server network, based on our long experience with Surfshark. It\u2019s not the largest provider. NordVPN offers 7,600+ servers in 118+ countries, while PIA packs 30,000+ in 90+ countries.\nBut saying that 3,200+ servers in 100 countries aren\u2019t enough is lunacy.\nSpeed Tests: Surfshark\u2019s Performance Evaluation\nIt\u2019s interesting to see the speed test results of such an affordable provider. It has all the prerequisites to be fast, including WireGuard and 10 Gbps servers. We tested the provider thoroughly but before explaining our procedure, here are our native speeds.\nWithout using a VPN, in Belgrade at the time of writing the review, our speeds look like the ones above. We tested Surfshark 3 times a day for 3 days in a row, using 3 server locations \u2013 the UK, the USA, and Japan. The protocol was set to \u201cAutomatic.\u201d\nAlso, the results you see below are the best we could achieve, so let us examine them now:\nUK Speed Test Results:\nUS Speed Test Results:\nJapan Speed Test Results:\nThe provider displayed impressive download speeds with arguably low latency. However, it took a punch to the belly in upload speeds whose reduction was pretty noticeable. If you prioritize uploads, NordVPN is the fastest VPN you can get in 2025.\n| UK Server | US Server | Japan Server | |\n| Download Speed Loss | 7.6% | 26% | 41.3% |\n| Upload Speed Loss | 23.8% | 51% | 85.2% |\nWe must notice one thing in our speed test results. Surfshark ended up being slightly faster than ExpressVPN in the same locations \u2014 at least in download speeds. This tells us volumes about Surfshark\u2019s improvements highlighted in this review.\nIf you want an overview at this level, we recommend reading the Surfshark vs NordVPN vs ExpressVPN comparison.\nStreaming & Torrenting With Surfshark\nAs soon as we started using this provider, we discovered how capable it is of streaming. We like this feature of Surfshark a lot. We performed countless tests on Netflix and managed to unblock around 30 (THIRTY) libraries, which is more than any other VPN.\nFor instance, apart from the popular catalogs, Surfshark worked with Netflix Turkey, Singapore, Hungary, and other \u201cless-expected-to-work\u201d libraries. Other streaming portals are a no-match for this provider. In particular, BBC iPlayer worked without a hitch.\nThanks to servers in India, Netflix India could be unblocked, along with TV channels from this country, such s Voot, Hotstar, and others. Even sports channels like ESPN and Eurosport can be added to the list, which is welcome for streaming Formula 1 races, for instance.\nAccess exclusive content with Surfshark\nThe provider also offers Smart DNS, which can be set up on non-VPN-supported devices for streaming. We noticed how well it worked on our PlayStation 5 where we could unblock Netflix US swiftly. Torrenting is another strength of this Dutch provider.\nAs you see above, we used Surfshark with \u03bcTorrent to download Linux. The performance is stable and the only reduction is in upload speed, which isn\u2019t that important anyway. Most impressively, the VPN has no dedicated or specialty servers for torrenting or streaming.\nYou can do everything with \u201cnormal\u201d servers by connecting to any location, which we liked immensely.\nUsing Surfshark for Bypassing Censorship\nA while ago in our Surfshark review, we mentioned NoBorders. The feature masks your VPN connection and lets you bypass censorship. Well, after testing the provider first and foremost in China, we\u2019ve discovered just how powerful NoBorders is.\nEnabling it makes Surfshark usable in China normally. Granted, speeds will not be blazing-fast but the performance is satisfactory. Furthermore, the VPN doesn\u2019t lock you to specific Obfuscated servers, so you can choose any location.\nWe noticed that even Netflix and torrenting sites work in China as well. In terms of reliability in this country, NordVPN is a bit better but Surfshark is a reliable VPN for China. As expected, the provider will also work in the UAE, Russia, Iran, and similar regions.\nCustomer Support\nGetting in touch with Surfshark couldn\u2019t be simpler. Once you\u2019re on the site, visit the Help Center, scroll down, and press \u201cChat With Us.\u201d Provide your email and name from here, and you\u2019re all set. The provider offers 24/7 live chat support to help you at any moment.\nIt\u2019s also fast to respond. After sending a message, it\u2019ll usually be picked up by someone in 5-10 seconds. Live chat support is great for minor connection problems and for more serious issues, email support is there, that can be contacted by sending a request from the site.\nSurfshark\u2019s on-site help means is impressive. Things like FAQs and guides have their place. There\u2019s also a search bar where you can type in your problem or question and likely find it in the huge knowledge base. Unlike PIA, it doesn\u2019t have a community forum.\nThis would be a welcome addition but at this point, it\u2019s really a nitpick.\nConclusion\nWith our in-depth review of Surfshark for 2025 at its end, we must say we\u2019re fond of it. The VPN displayed some high-quality traits non-typical for such an affordable service. It\u2019s secure, keeps no logs, and is fast on all of the tested server locations.\nWe also like its applications, unlimited connections, and impeccable streaming capabilities. Surfshark doesn\u2019t have a load of shortcomings, as you likely saw. However, we\u2019d like to mention that we\u2019re not fans of its Dutch jurisdiction, despite all of the VPN\u2019s audits.\nCompared to NordVPN and ExpressVPN, Surfshark\u2019s jurisdiction is much less privacy-friendly. Also, its upload speeds were quite slow in our test, and the VPN\u2019s past kill switch problems produced security doubts in many people\u2019s minds.\nApart from that, at this price, we think that Surfshark is a solid choice. It\u2019s better than CyberGhost if you will. So, should you get it? We\u2019d say yes but only as a long-term VPN because of expensive monthly plans. If you don\u2019t mind paying roughly a dollar more a month, NordVPN remains a better service."

NordVPN is many people\u2019s preferred choice for privacy and security.\nAs one of the leading services, it has AES-256 encryption to let you go online without ISP monitoring. We\u2019ll add that its amazing Double VPN servers route your traffic through two servers (instead of one), ensuring two encryption layers for double the security.\nNordVPN proudly offers Threat Protection Pro on all devices. It can block ads, malware, and viruses, swiftly providing 360-degree protection. This top-rated VPN uses an automatic kill switch to prevent IP leaks, while Private DNS servers deter DNS leaks.\nNordVPN is also a no-logging service from Panama. It has several third-party audits from companies like Deloitte and PwC, some of the most renowned auditors.\nNordVPN is also the most reliable VPN for streaming and torrenting, both of which are very enjoyable and appreciated by this VPN\u2019s wide audience.\nThe NordLynx protocol provides fast speeds, properly utilized by NordVPN\u2019s 10 Gbps servers. Its technological prowess is reflected in P2P servers whose torrenting speeds are astonishing. Better yet, NordVPN works with 20+ Netflix libraries for plenty of amazing content.\nWe love NordVPN\u2019s recent improvements, such as 10 simultaneous connections and more locations worldwide. It even offers obfuscated servers that work in China thanks to VPN obfuscation for bypassing DPI and various firewall restrictions.\nPrice\nAs the best VPN in 2025, NordVPN\u2019s price is surprisingly low. Considering its addition of 24/7 live chat support, Smart DNS, Meshnet, and even dedicated IPs in dozens of countries, NordVPN is a service whose faults are non-existent. In our experience, NordVPN is the epitome of a leading VPN.\nIt works on iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux, and many other devices, and it\u2019s one of the few to offer a VPN app for Apple TV.\nOur team\u2019s advice is to grab a special time-limited 70%+ discount on NordVPN\u2019s 2-year plans and pay only about $3/mo. The company has a generous 30-day money-back guarantee to make your purchase risk-free.\n2. ExpressVPN \u2013 best for speeds and stability\nPros\n- Unlimited monthly traffic\n- Based in the British Virgin Islands\n- Split tunneling is included\n- Great VPN apps for tvOS and Firestick\n- MediaStreamer\n- Perfect Forward Secrecy\n- Compatible with routers\nCons\n- It\u2019s not the most affordable option\n- Double VPN servers could be added\nRight behind our top VPN pick is ExpressVPN.\nFeatures\nIt\u2019s one of the best VPN services with state-of-the-art encryption and RAM servers for the highest level of security.\nExpressVPN takes pride in its Lightway protocol, offering a splendid balance of safety and speed. ExpressVPN is as fast as NordVPN.\nOur test of ExpressVPN showed impressive performance for gaming, streaming on Hulu, and downloading torrents. Coupled with unlimited traffic and mighty 10 Gbps servers, ExpressVPN\u2019s status as one of the top-rated VPNs is clear as day.\nExpressVPN works on all your devices, each app coming with Advanced Protection which can block ads, trackers, and adult sites. The VPN uses split tunneling and there\u2019s a kill switch to protect you from all sorts of leaks. We\u2019re thoroughly impressed by this VPN\u2019s compatibility.\nIn particular, its tvOS app is amazing for streaming. We should also mention its router support and 8 simultaneous connections per subscription. Our team appreciates its built-in obfuscation and OpenVPN TCP support for added variety and bypassing censorship.\nBeing one of the best VPN services to use in 2025, ExpressVPN uses something called Perfect Forward Secrecy. It assigns unique encryption keys to each connection, preventing data theft as a result. ExpressVPN is based in the British Virgin Islands, a well-known off-shore location.\nThis allows it to keep no traffic logs or anything related to your IP and browsing history. Besides, it\u2019s one of the leading VPNs with a lot of security audits under its belt. At the moment, we\u2019re looking at over 18 but we\u2019re sure there\u2019ll be more in the future.\nPrice\nExpressVPN\u2019s only downside is the price, which can be hellishly expensive for some.\nHowever, let us cheer you up with an amazing offer. How about you get 4 free months for the 2-year plan and as a result, enjoy a 61% price reduction? Or perhaps, a 1-year plan with 3 free months and a 48% discount? Both are phenomenal!\nOn top of that, we\u2019ll squeeze some juice out from the 30-day money-back guarantee, which applies to all plans, making each totally risk-free. Claim the desired deal below and test ExpressVPN now.\n3. Private Internet Access \u2013 best for VPN users on a budget\nPros\n- Incredibly affordable 2-year plan\n- Unlimited simultaneous connections\n- PIA MACE for blocking ads\n- No-logs policy proven in court\n- Multiple proxies (Shadowsocks/SOCKS5)\n- DNS leak protection\nCons\n- No Firestick app\n- Not working in China\nAlmost at the very top of our VPN ranking is Private Internet Access \u2013 the best Virtual Private Network in 2025 for budget-obsessed users.\nFeatures\nPIA is the biggest VPN with 30,000+ servers in nearly 100 countries globally. While not the fastest paid VPN around, PIA is incredibly secure. It doesn\u2019t store logs and offers advanced security features, such as bank-grade encryption and port forwarding.\nWe like its WireGuard inclusion, with the option to use a custom port and customize each protocol additionally. Users appreciate PIA\u2019s MACE function, which is a renowned ad blocker. PIA is torrent-friendly, which we\u2019ve come to love after years of using it.\nStreaming is also possible on a few Netflix catalogs. Private Internet Access is our favorite choice \u2013 or one of \u2013 if we\u2019re talking about logging. Despite the US jurisdiction, PIA is a no-log VPN whose claims were proven in the audit by Deloitte. Not only that!\nPrivate Internet Access proved its claims in court multiple times, where the authorities couldn\u2019t extract a single bit of data from it! PIA VPN is an excellent choice for router users or those looking for a simple-to-use VPN for Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, or Android.\nDespite the low price, PIA offers UNLIMITED simultaneous connections, 24/7 live chat support, and all the other bells and whistles from before. They include RAM-only servers, DNS leak protection, split tunneling, a kill switch, and even Shadowsocks/SOCKS5 proxies.\nAt the moment, PIA isn\u2019t working in China \u2013 NordVPN and ExpressVPN do. This explains why this still respectable VPN isn\u2019t a #1 provider. However, its price, reliability, security, and privacy make Private Internet Access an incredibly popular option worldwide, and by extension, one of our favorites.\nPrice\nPIA is one of the best cheap VPNs and with a 2-year plan with a couple of free months at around $2/mo is more attractive than Scarlet Johansson. Let\u2019s not lose from our eyesight a 30-day money-back guarantee for all plans, making PIA completely risk-free to test and use.\nAnd if you don\u2019t want to pay right away, there\u2019s a nifty 7-day free trial on iOS and Android. Though, the price after that isn\u2019t discounted, so we advise using the links above instead and immediately saving more than 80%.\n4. Proton VPN \u2013 best VPN for privacy and zero logging\nPros\n- Swiss privacy\n- 9,900+ worldwide servers\n- Onion over VPN support\n- Efficient streaming and torrenting\n- Port forwarding\n- Includes a free plan with unlimited traffic\nCons\n- Does not work in heavily censored countries\n- Smart DNS isn\u2019t supported\nProton VPN is for many the best overall VPN for privacy.\nFeatures\nThis comes down to its Swiss jurisdiction and a verified no-logs policy. Proton VPN offers a wealth of unique features, such as Secure Core servers, Stealth VPN, and OpenVPN and WireGuard protocols.\nWe appreciate Proton VPN for its free plan with unlimited traffic. Paid users will get more, though. The VPN is fast enough and there\u2019s the VPN Accelerator to speed things up. The VPN\u2019s encryption is bank-grade and you\u2019ll find its NetShield ad blocker pretty nifty for blocking ads.\nAnother perk of Proton VPN is the server park. As a widely adopted VPN in 2025, it covers a whopping 117+ countries with 9,900+ 10 Gbps servers. They\u2019re optimized for streaming on a variety of services, with full support for P2P in any location. Proton VPN even has onion over VPN servers.\nThey can be used with Tor to visit the dark web privately. Proton VPN doesn\u2019t limit your traffic, and is, as such, useful for gaming even on mobile devices. With 10 simultaneous connections, it protects all your devices with easy-to-use apps filled to the brim with features.\nWe should praise Proton VPN\u2019s port forwarding for speeding up your torrent downloads. Proton VPN can be installed on your Fire TV Stick as well, and with a free app for this platform, you can enjoy countless hours of streaming and watching movies and series.\nThe VPN doesn\u2019t have Smart DNS and its performance, while still excellent, isn\u2019t on the level of the top-rated VPNs like NordVPN or ExpressVPN. However, the fourth place is amazing and these few flaws don\u2019t negate Proton VPN\u2019s extraordinary service!\nPrice\nProton VPN isn\u2019t very expensive either, at around $3/mo for the 2-year plan. However, it\u2019s a tad pricier than, let\u2019s say Private Internet Access. For us, however, NordVPN is a slightly better option for similar money, hence the first in our ranking.\nAfter all, Proton VPN doesn\u2019t work in China despite the Stealth protocol, so it\u2019s a poor option for users in censored regions. For a VPN of this price, we\u2019d appreciate Proton VPN\u2019s improvement in this field but we\u2019re sure we\u2019ll get our wishes fulfilled at some point.\n5. Surfshark \u2013 best VPN for protecting unlimited devices\nPros\n- NoBorders adds obfuscation\n- Works with Netflix and Prime Video\n- Offers many Static IP addresses\n- No limits on simultaneous connections\n- RAM-only servers\nCons\n- Not the fastest VPN in 2025\n- It lacks discounts for monthly plans\nIf you seek problem-free, anonymous, and smooth surfing, you might want to rely on a leading service like Surfshark.\nFeatures\nThis provider\u2019s amazing security with features like MultiHop and 256-bit encryption make it special. Even better, users get NoBorders, which adds obfuscation.\nThis allows Surfshark to work in China and get over stubborn firewalls. This is the best VPN if you seek additional value in unlimited concurrent connections. In addition, it has IP Rotation, which rotates your IP and keeps your online location the same, adding to your security.\nSurfshark is an incredible VPN for streaming. We used it to unblock 30+ Netflix libraries, with platforms like Hulu, Prime Video, and MAX working like a charm abroad. It\u2019s one of the rare VPNs that offer Static IP addresses as standard, which you\u2019ll find nowhere else among quality providers!\nWe should point out its WireGuard support, which makes this provider\u2019s performance stable. Sure, it\u2019s not the fastest but our tests showed its gaming and torrenting prowess too. Paying slightly more for the One plan gives you access to Surfshark\u2019s Antivirus.\nBetter yet, you\u2019ll get a superior private browser for going online without tracking. While the company is registered in the Netherlands, in the 14 Eyes region, it has a strict no-log VPN provider with many audits. We know that it uses RAM servers and keeps no logs of your IP address or DNS queries.\nPrice\nSurfshark is flexible and affordable for pretty much anyone. Its dedicated IP addresses are slightly expensive and NordVPN is better in this regard. However, as one of the best-rated VPNs around, Surfshark is hard to blame for such small inconveniences.\nThink about this. You can get this highly-rated service at around $2/mo and enjoy all of the features mentioned earlier. While not better than NordVPN by any means, it\u2019s good to know that it merged with that company, explaining a sudden rush of improvements on both sides.\n6. CyberGhost \u2013 best VPN for streaming and torrenting convenience\nPros\n- WireGuard and OpenVPN protocols\n- Cheap antivirus software for computers\n- Dedicated IP addresses\n- Suitable for P2P and streaming on all devices\n- NoSpy servers owned by CyberGhost\nCons\n- No obfuscated servers\n- Longer connection times with OpenVPN\nCyberGhost is the best paid VPN for those who don\u2019t want to spend a fortune on such a service.\nFeatures\nIt also comes with thousands of dedicated streaming and torrenting servers in each app. Connect to a server for Hotstar, for example, and stream this platform anywhere! As a service based in Romania, CyberGhost is free of logging and storing your private data.\nThis is complemented by transparency reports published a few times a year. CyberGhost\u2019s NoSpy servers are excellent for added privacy, too. This VPN is characterized by exquisite performance thanks to WireGuard whose implementation is perfect.\nRemember that CyberGhost has unmetered traffic, allowing for ideal gaming even on distant servers. The service doesn\u2019t have obfuscation and isn\u2019t the best VPN for China. On the flip side, it\u2019s equipped with 256-bit AES encryption and a reliable kill switch to prevent IP leaks.\nIt offers an array of Dedicated IP addresses in over 21 locations for cheap. We also adore its Smart DNS support, with IP addresses in plenty of locations for superior streaming.\nCyberGhost gives you an ad blocker, which can be handy on streaming or gambling sites. It\u2019s a good VPN if you need all devices protected, as it offers 7 simultaneous connections. Granted, it\u2019s not much compared to our best VPN in 2025, NordVPN, but still plentiful for many users.\nOverall, it\u2019s a pretty impressive option with intuitive apps, reliable support, and maximum transparency. This is, in the end, why it\u2019s one of our favorite VPN services. Find out more about it in our comprehensive review of CyberGhost.\nPrice\nLike PIA, CyberGhost\u2019s long-term plans are killer deals, especially with a gargantuan 45-day money-back guarantee. Apart from the price, the VPN offers access to 12,000+ servers and has an antivirus that you can buy for $1 on top of your subscription.\nEven if you decide to get an antivirus, the entire package won\u2019t cost you above $3.5/mo. At such a price, it\u2019s almost as if you were stealing the VPN from CyberGhost. But don\u2019t worry \u2013 CyberGhost won\u2019t sue you.\n7. Hide.me \u2013 best for advanced security features\nPros\n- 256-bit AES encryption with 8192-bit keys\n- Works with BBC iPlayer\n- MultiHop offers two encryption layers\n- Cheap long-term plans\nCons\n- The free plan forbids P2P\n- It could benefit from more servers\nHide.me has seen some massive improvements lately. This isn\u2019t our absolute favorite VPN but it does quite a few things right.\nFeatures\nOne is privacy produced by the Malaysian jurisdiction. An off-shore country like this allows Hide.me to keep ZERO logs of your online activities.\nAs one of our top picks, Hide.me offers multiple secure protocols like WireGuard, OpenVPN, IKEv2, and SoftEther. Moreover, Hide.me uses 8192-bit keys for its AES-256 encryption, making you untraceable online, even if we\u2019re talking about NSA-level hackers.\nRecent improvements to this amazing premium VPN include streaming, which makes Hide.me viable for Netflix or BBC iPlayer. Torrenting works well, as Hide.me offers fast speeds to tackle your bandwidth-hungry needs. No doubt, Hide.me\u2019s profession is security.\nYou\u2019ll get a LOAD of features like dynamic port forwarding, IP leak protection, and even MultiHop to add another layer of encryption. Hide.me comes with SmartGuard, which can block ads, trackers, and malicious sites. Similar to Threat Protection Pro in NordVPN but slightly inferior.\nHide.me has around 2,600 servers in 90 locations, making it among the smallest VPNs on this list. This isn\u2019t a deal breaker considering its amazing 10 simultaneous connections and well-optimized applications for all desktop and mobile systems.\nPrice\nLike Proton VPN, this top VPN in 2025 has a free, unrestricted plan with respectable security. You\u2019ll get the most out of its paid plans, however. Hide.me used to be expensive back in the day but now, you can get the cheapest plan at under $2.5/month.\nIt\u2019s worth experiencing, let us tell you. Especially if you factor in a 30-day money-back guarantee, which is a nice \u201ccover\u201d in case you\u2019re left unimpressed.\n8. IPVanish \u2013 best for app simplicity\nPros\n- Threat Protection\n- SOCKS5 proxy\n- Unlimited connections\n- Stellar P2P performance\nCons\n- No advanced security features\n- It lacks a refund policy for the monthly plan\n- Logging issues in the past\nAs we move on with the list of the top-rated VPNs, we have a less impressive option \u2013 IPVanish.\nFeatures\nThis VPN doesn\u2019t impress with speed or performance. It is, however, pretty stable overall and offers above 2,400 servers in almost 140 locations. Similar story to Hide.me.\nIPVanish is streaming-friendly to an extent but we noticed great performance for torrenting. Also, a recent addition of Threat Protection made this VPN much better. It can now block trackers, ads, and malicious sites but unfortunately, malware/virus protection is absent.\nIPVanish\u2019s apps are intuitive enough but slightly outdated. This is countered by many servers in the US usable for Netflix and Hulu. A long time ago, IPVanish used to store logs under another owner. In 2025, it\u2019s one of the top VPNs for a reason \u2013 it obviously doesn\u2019t store logs anymore!\nWith an external audit that it proudly bears, IPVanish is a 100% safe VPN to use. When it comes to advanced features, the provider doesn\u2019t offer many. However, a kill switch, IP/DNS leak protection, and split tunneling are there, making the VPN better than most rivals.\nIPVanish supports the SOCKS5 proxy, which can be used for both safety and torrenting. The good news is that the provider offers unlimited connections, making it a leader in device support. Speaking of which, IPVanish works on all devices \u2013 mobile, desktop, or TV.\nPrice\nThis VPN doesn\u2019t offer a free plan but this isn\u2019t an issue in our book. Its affordable 24-month Esssential plan at under $2.3/mo is worth checking out but be aware that its monthly plan isn\u2019t covered by a 30-day money-back guarantee.\nWe expected a bit more generosity from this reputable VPN.\nIPVanish also has an Advanced plan with Threat Protection, Secure Browser, Cloud Backup, and phone support. At $3.29/mo, it\u2019s also a great VPN offer to try, alas, not better than NordVPN at a similar price.\n9. TunnelBear \u2013 best for teams\nPros\n- The best-looking VPN app\n- Offers a VPN for teams\n- GhostBear masks your VPN traffic\n- Free plan available\nCons\n- It\u2019s a bit slower than expected\n- Can\u2019t bypass the Great Firewall of China\n- Poor free plan with only 2 GB of monthly bandwidth\nWe know TunnelBear as a popular free VPN.\nFeatures\nUnfortunately, its free plan is purely average, with no excitement on the horizon. It\u2019s a tad better as a paid option, with unlimited bandwidth and slightly faster, although far from impressive speeds. We\u2019ve got to give some credit.\nTunnelBear looks amazing, with beautiful in-app animations and the furry bear mascot. Additionally, the VPN is optimized for macOS, Windows, iOS, and Android, and while all apps work smoothly, this is all you get. No other devices are supported.\nTunnelBear has been audited multiple times for storing no logs. Yes, it\u2019s a Canadian VPN but we know your private info doesn\u2019t linger on its servers. This VPN uses a kill switch for additional security but there\u2019s GhostBear, obfuscation for circumventing firewalls.\nTunnelBear habitually doesn\u2019t work in China, so don\u2019t expect miracles. Its server fleet is unimpressive for a premium VPN. It consists of a little over 3,000 servers in around 50 countries. Think about NordVPN or ExpressVPN with over 105 countries on offer.\nOn the brighter side, the VPN has unlimited concurrent connections and supports P2P in the paid version. We noticed below-average streaming performance, as Netflix and Prime Video usually won\u2019t work that well.\nPrice\nAt least TunnelBear won\u2019t charge you much for its plans.\n1-year and 3-year plans are just above $3.33 a month and TunnelBear has special \u201cTeams\u201d plans for companies. A free plan is there too but with 2 GB of monthly bandwidth, it\u2019s hardly worth your time, let alone day-to-day use, which seems, and IS impossible.\n10. Hotspot Shield \u2013 best for live sports streaming\nPros\n- Hydra VPN protocol\n- Lots of supported devices\n- DNS Filter can block unwanted sites\nCons\n- US jurisdiction breeds privacy issues\n- No GUI on Linux\n- Questionable logging in the free version\nOne thing we like about Hotspot Shield is its nice-looking and modern VPN app for Windows.\nFeatures\nThis usually isn\u2019t our preferred or favorite premium VPN but we enjoy some of its features, such as an automatic kill switch, military-grade encryption, and split tunneling.\nHotspot Shield users get another unexpected perk \u2013 Hydra. This is the VPN\u2019s in-house protocol built on OpenVPN TLS for impressive performance and added obfuscation. We tested it in China and it\u2019s not working but milder firewalls can be bypassed promptly.\nOur tests also demonstrated that the VPN works for streaming and watching live sports. Torrenting is quite fast and the VPN\u2019s unlimited bandwidth results in a staggering experience. Its paid version is characterized by many servers \u2013 around 800+ in 125+ locations.\nHotspot Shield also supports routers, allowing people to \u201cinadvertently\u201d protect gaming consoles. The VPN allows for 10 simultaneous connections and properly supports Linux. However, Proton VPN offers a GUI VPN for Linux distros, which you\u2019ll find more pleasing.\nAs one of the top VPNs around, Hotspot Shield has built-in phishing protection, Tor over VPN support, and DNS Filter to block specific websites. Smart VPN is its name for split tunneling and the VPN stores no logs. Beware that this isn\u2019t the case with its free plan.\nIn this case, the VPN will store logs and possibly sell your data because it displays targeted ads in mobile apps. Hotspot Shield is a US-based VPN, so it\u2019s at the core of the 5 Eyes alliance. Its history wasn\u2019t the best and some logging incidents were present.\nBetternet, a VPN from the same father company, is also to blame.\nPrice\nHotspot Shield is a tad expensive for what it offers but its 45-day refund policy is quite impressive. And while it\u2019s surely a solid VPN, its price is unjustifiably high at just under $6.7/mo, leaving it to hang at the bottom of our ranking of the best of the best VPNs for 2025.\nHow We Tested and Ranked the Best VPNs in 2025\nAs stated, our team of cybersecurity experts stands behind everything said so far. We tested all of these VPN services \u2013 and hundreds more! However, we hold no secrets and will gladly explain and divulge our testing process to aid your selection of the top picks for this year.\nBelow are the most important VPN aspects we analyzed when making this comprehensive list. We suggest you read them carefully to better understand the selection process.\nSecurity, Privacy & Reputation\nThe top paid VPNs have incredible reputations as some of the most secure options in 2025. NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and PIA all have no-logs policies and audits by the most respected companies like PwC, Deloitte, Cure53, KPMG, and others.\nLet\u2019s not forget their top-tier encryption standards that don\u2019t go below 256-bit. Our best picks are proven to not keep ANY logs while asserting dominance over other VPNs with features like a kill switch, DNS leak protection, RAM servers, Private DNS, and plenty more.\nSuch features won\u2019t \u201cmeet\u201d you in free providers or low-quality \u201cpremium\u201d options we avoided.\nStreaming & Torrenting\nStreaming is paramount for many of the best-rated VPN services. NordVPN is the #1 VPN here, as it works with a wealth of Netflix libraries and all other platforms under the sun. We won\u2019t name all of them here because it would take too much of your precious time.\nSimultaneously, it offers thousands of P2P servers for anonymous, fast, and stable torrenting. It\u2019s no coincidence that we think NordVPN is also the best VPN for torrenting. That\u2019s also because it has SOCKS5, which is frequently employed for P2P for better speeds.\nAll the VPNs are equipped with powerful 10 Gbps servers to take full advantage of your internet speed. This ensures torrenting, streaming, and even gaming with low latency and excellent performance that you can\u2019t find in just any VPN on the market.\nPerformance\nSpeaking of this factor, our top VPN picks in 2025 offer a creme de la creme of performance. NordVPN and ExpressVPN lead the pack, with PIA and Proton VPN following closely. This is important for a smooth browsing experience even on more distant servers.\nOur experts performed a myriad of tests across thousands of servers for this purpose. We wanted to provide you with the fastest VPNs for every device. Fast internet connections are crucial and no one like slouches whose latency is through the roof.\nServer Locations\nWe\u2019re huge fans of large server fleets among the most reliable paid VPNs. NordVPN has 117+ countries and over 7,110 servers! Think about PIA with 30,000 and more. Then, we have CyberGhost with 12,000+ servers and Proton VPN\u2019s fleet that counts 9,900+ and more.\nTheir server locations are varied. All top-rated VPN services are equipped with US servers too, so Americans abroad can swiftly obtain their homeland IP address for whatever reason.\nNordVPN has 2,000+ of them in this country, while PIA offers servers in every American state. This tells a lot about the sheer quality of these services.\nAlways keep in mind that a large server network doesn\u2019t not always mean high-quality VPN. Indeed, the quality of the servers is extremely important, sometimes even more than the number. But we don\u2019t think we need to repeat that the quality of these servers is unquestionable.\nBypassing Censorship\nGetting over harsh censorship is a bloody hard job and one that our preferred VPNs do well for the most part.\nWe tested ALL of them in China, Russia, Turkey, the UAE, and other censored regions. While some are incapable of working in China, the majority will work.\nWe\u2019d like to mention NordVPN as the most notable pick, but ExpressVPN and even Surfshark are amazing thanks to obfuscation and masking your traffic. Henceforth, these amazing VPNs can get over Deep Packet Inspection and provide a safe internet experience.\nWith these services, whatever the country, you\u2019ll have no trouble unblocking a blocked site. The same goes for using a VPN in school, where all of them will circumvent the school firewall and allow you to use any website, platform, or app.\nCompatibility & Ease of Use\nThis experience translates to any device your mind can fathom. Sure, your fridge won\u2019t support our favorite VPNs but other devices will. They work on:\n- iOS\n- Android\n- Windows\n- macOS\n- Linux\n- Routers\n- Gaming consoles\n- Smart TVs\n- Fire TV Stick\n- Apple TV, and dozens of other systems.\nAll great VPNs are designed with at least 7 simultaneous connections. Many options, like PIA, Surfshark, IPVanish, and TunnelBear allow for unlimited connections per account. All of them are easy to use, with one-click connections to get you safely online.\nIf you\u2019re a beginner, you\u2019re welcome to try one but if you lack confidence, we explain how to use a VPN in this guide.\nCustomer Service\nCustomer support was important in our testing procedure. The #1 rated VPN \u2013 NordVPN \u2013 excels in this regard, with round-the-clock 24/7 live chat support. The same applies to ExpressVPN, PIA, CyberGhost, and other top picks on this list.\nThis is crucial if you run into problems and want them fixed promptly. You can be sure these support teams will come to your aid faster than you can say \u201cVirtual Private Network.\u201d\nPrice (Affordability)\nYou\u2019d be surprised at how inexpensive the best VPN services in 2025 are. They cost around $2 to $6.8 a month, which is what you\u2019ll pay for a coffee in Starbucks. Their money-back guarantee and free trials in some cases make them pretty attractive and risk-free.\nTake NordVPN \u2013 our number 1 provider. It costs just over $3/mo and provides all the benefits we mentioned. Think of something more valuable than an excellent VPN like this one. At a price cheaper than a Starbucks coffee, you\u2019re getting all the online protection you\u2019ll ever need!\nWhy We Avoid Free VPN Providers?\nWe have a separate guide discussing free VPNs. Our team opts for the best paid VPNs because they\u2019re limitless. Free services limit your bandwidth, they\u2019re slower and usually don\u2019t offer impressive security. Storing logs is another dangerous game they\u2019re playing.\nThis is prevalent in low-quality and \u201ctotally\u201d free options like Hola VPN or Urban VPN. They admit to storing logs regarding your IP address, location, traffic destination, and social-media-related data. Streaming and torrenting are often problematic with them.\nMany free options intentionally block P2P traffic. They also don\u2019t work with Netflix or BBC iPlayer. A glaring issue is poor device compatibility and apps that lack basic stuff like WireGuard, a kill switch, and servers. Most of them offer 3-5 server locations, also!\nThese providers are by no means the top picks if you\u2019re looking for an excellent premium experience. However, we encourage your curiosity and want you to test them. Just be aware of the lack of simultaneous connections, poor customer support, and other shortcomings.\nConclusion\nWith the 10 best VPN services to use in 2025, it\u2019s time to sign off. We made this list according to the VPNs\u2019 qualities and our personal experience. NordVPN is at the top of our ranking due to its extreme performance, strong security, streaming/P2P capabilities, and much more.\nIt\u2019s a no-brainer as a leader in the VPN industry and an exquisite paid service. ExpressVPN\u2019s expensive price is a downside for many but the provider is filled with impressive security features, excellent compatibility, and fast 10 Gbps servers.\nWe shouldn\u2019t forget Private Internet Access as one of the most popular VPNs in the US and abroad. It\u2019s perfect for unlimited connections, advanced security, and streaming on a few popular services. Other options have their qualities worth looking into if you\u2019re curious.\nIt\u2019s your move now. Which VPN provider are you going to choose? You\u2019re spoilt for choice at this point!\nFAQ\nWe know you\u2019re fully informed about the most dependable VPNs in today\u2019s day and age. Still, we feel obligated to clarify things even more and address some of your burning questions about them. No one got hurt by learning more!\nAre VPNs legal?\nYes, they\u2019re perfectly legal in the majority of the world, including Europe, the USA, Asia, Africa, and Australia.\nVery few countries openly ban VPNs, such as Oman, Iraq, North Korea, Turkmenistan, and Belarus. In most other countries, VPNs are allowed.\nIf you\u2019re still not sure whether your country allows them, read this guide about the legality of VPNs where we explain everything in depth. However, if you\u2019re a frequent Gizmodo visitor, you\u2019re not only smart but also most likely in a non-censored country that allows VPNs.\nDo I really need a VPN?\nIt depends on your needs and expectations. VPNs are great privacy tools that will rid you of ISP throttling, surveillance, geo-blocks, and other annoying stuff. If you don\u2019t think you need all the VPN benefits and you\u2019re feeling your internet experience is fine, you likely don\u2019t need a VPN.\nBut since you\u2019re reading this article, you likely do for one or more reasons mentioned earlier. VPNs aren\u2019t mandatory but they vastly improve your privacy and give you more internet freedom. Whether you need one is totally up to you but you can always refer to our list of all the VPN benefits and see where you land.\nHow to set up and use a VPN?\nLike any other application. You don\u2019t need to be tech-savvy, so follow these steps:\n- Get the best VPN from our list \u2013 we advise NordVPN.\n- Download and install NordVPN on your device.\n- Open the application and sign in with your email/password.\n- Select the server and connect to it. Done!\nAll VPNs function the same and the initial setup is done in a minute. After that, it takes one click or tap on the screen to connect and enjoy.\nHow much is the best VPN in 2025?\nYou don\u2019t have to splurge an insane amount of money on a leading VPN service.\nVPNs usually cost very little and the best one, like NordVPN, can cost you a measly three quids a month. Of course, there are more expensive options, such as ExpressVPN, whose price is about five bucks. As you can see, all the best VPNs are a few dollars a month.\nThe price goes up if you pay monthly. By paying for a long-term plan upfront and using our links, you can save more than 80% and snatch the VPN you want without breaking the bank."

      "text": "Whichever VPN service you prefer, you can\u2019t deny ExpressVPN\u2019s greatness. Despite this claim, our team still performed a comprehensive test of ExpressVPN. This provider has been around for quite a while, with a rich history of impeccable privacy and high performance.\nWhile its simple apps look anemic compared to NordVPN, this provider packs a V8 engine under the hood. It offers not only a VPN service but also a capable password manager, Advanced Protection, and even an in-house VPN protocol for added security.\nIf you read any ExpressVPN review online, you\u2019ll see nothing but praises \u2014 logically. However, is this provider as perfect as many say, especially because of its slightly higher price? Is the service so immaculate that it deserves the title of the King of VPNs?\nWe\u2019ll answer these questions in the following in-depth review of ExpressVPN. Just so you know, we\u2019ve been using this provider from its inception. Our team knows every nook and cranny of ExpressVPN, as we\u2019ve been with it during all of the improvement phases.\nIn other words, this test is based solely on our experience with ExpressVPN. You\u2019ll see unique speed test results and our first-hand analysis of this service.\nExpressVPN\nOur general experience with ExpressVPN was phenomenal. ExpressVPN excels in all use cases (streaming, bypassing blocks, etc.), offering a user-friendly app and excellent performance. Its only drawback is that it's not inexpensive.\nPros\n- Proprietary Lightway VPN protocol\n- Dozens of independent third-party audits\n- Fast speeds for streaming, gaming, and P2P\n- Servers in more than 160 locations (105 countries)\n- Works in China thanks to obfuscation\n- Effective for bypassing geographic restrictions imposed by streaming services\nCons\n- More expensive than many of its competitors\n- It doesn't offer MultiHop servers\nExpressVPN Pricing: How Much Does It Cost?\nWe\u2019ll start this analysis with the price. If you\u2019re a veteran in the VPN world, you likely know what a top-tier provider like this offers. In that case, the only thing left to find out is how much you\u2019ll pay for it. ExpressVPN\u2019s pricing structure couldn\u2019t be simpler.\nThe plan in the middle is an obvious attention catcher. It\u2019s a special 61% discount thanks to 4 free months for 24 months. As you can see, the monthly price is then $4.49, which is a lot higher than NordVPN \u2014 our preferred pick overall.\nNordVPN costs between $3 and $4 a month depending on the current deal. Private Internet Access, for instance, sits at around $2/mo for the cheapest deal. Now, ExpressVPN\u2019s price isn\u2019t just false confidence. Be patient, we\u2019ll get to its more advanced features later.\nFor now, it\u2019s good to briefly mention monthly and annual plans. We, however, don\u2019t recommend these plans because they\u2019re truly expensive. The 1-month plan, in particular, is one of the less valuable VPN deals at a whopping $12.95/mo.\nOn the flip side, the annual plan\u2019s price is ExpressVPN\u2019s ex-best deal, so it\u2019s a 48% discount and $6.67/mo thanks to 3 free months. Frankly, we\u2019ve seen cheaper annual VPNs. One of them we mentioned \u2014 NordVPN.\nTo take advantage of the best rates, make sure to check out our article featuring the current promotions at ExpressVPN.\nMoney-Back Guarantee and Free Trial\nWe love that the provider is still quite generous and flexible. A 30-day money-back guarantee covers all plans. This is handy if you want to test the service, see whether you like it, and decide whether you want to keep paying or get a refund.\nGetting a refund is a breeze here. Contact ExpressVPN\u2019s support team using the live chat widget, say that you want your money back, and you\u2019re done. The provider offers no free plans or anything similar.\nHowever, our team appreciates the 7-day free trial on mobile devices. This is one of the most generous VPN free trials of 2025. After trying out this \u201csetup\u201d, many users continued using ExpressVPN for its numerous advantages.\nPayment Methods\nExpressVPN\u2019s payment methods are versatile as they\u2019re ubiquitous. The VPN currently lets you pay using:\n- Credit/debit cards\n- PayPal\n- Bitcoin\n- UnionPay\n- GiroPay\n- Sofort\n- iDeal, and a few others\u2026\nAs you can see, there\u2019s no excuse not to get the service. You can pay for it through a wealth of vendors. The only problem would be the lack of money but that\u2019s another sad story\u2026\nEase of Use & Compatibility\nOur experience with ExpressVPN has been great throughout the years. A part of it is due to how simple it is to use. Its apps look identical on all platforms, so it doesn\u2019t matter which one you\u2019re using. The following screenshot shows you the Windows VPN app.\nThis prominent connection button can be used to connect to a server in seconds. The same applies to your phone, let\u2019s say, where the service will work equally as well. One thing we like about ExpressVPN is the overwhelming device compatibility.\nWe\u2019ll list the most notable supported devices, systems, and browsers:\n- Windows, Linux, and macOS computers and laptops\n- Android and iOS phones and tablets\n- Smart TVs and streaming systems/devices (Apple TV, Firestick, Nvidia Shield, Kodi, Chromecast, \u2026)\n- Routers (Asus, Linksys, Netgear, D-Link, DD-WRT, Tomato, \u2026)\n- Browser extensions for Firefox, Brave, Edge, and Chrome\nIn addition to supported devices, ExpressVPN has an interesting addition of Aircove routers. These are Wi-Fi 6 routers for superb connectivity with a built-in VPN for additional privacy and security. You can buy one from the provider\u2019s site for just over $160.\nIn terms of simultaneous connections, ExpressVPN is capped at 8.\nDuring our ExpressVPN review and general use, we found this to be more than enough. However, if you still need more, consider NordVPN with 10 or PIA with unlimited simultaneous connections.\nSecurity Features of ExpressVPN: Is It Safe to Use?\nThe pillar of our in-depth ExpressVPN review is the security and privacy analysis. As one of the most dependable services, we\u2019re sure our experience with it will interest you. Don\u2019t worry. Our team already tested a load of ExpressVPN\u2019s security features with exquisite results.\nBasic VPN Features\nWe\u2019d first like to go over its basic features and see what the provider offers. These features are available in pretty much every service of this caliber and are, more or less, familiar.\n- 256-bit Encryption: As you likely know, this is the strongest, most dependable encryption standard in the world. Impenetrable and potent, this \u201cbank-grade\u201d encryption is the backbone of every ExpressVPN connection, resulting in a staggering level of security.\n- Network Lock: It\u2019s the company\u2019s name for a kill switch. It protects you against IP address leaks by shutting off the internet connection when the VPN connection drops. Our experience with this provider was more than stable, so we encountered less than a few connection drops so far, during which, the kill switch immediately sprung into action.\n- Split Tunneling: It lets you choose which apps you want to route through the VPN tunnel. Like NordVPN, the provider relies on the App Split Tunneling. We\u2019d like to see the Domain Split Tunneling from CyberGhost as well.\n- Perfect Forward Secrecy: Another gem from this company. This technology assigns unique, never-before-used encryption keys to each connection. As soon as you disconnect, the encryption key is lost to oblivion and never assigned again. This allows the provider to prevent data breaches and bolster your privacy.\nAdvanced Security Features\nWhile ExpressVPN is not as packed as NordVPN or Surfshark, it still offers a myriad of advanced features that make it special. It\u2019s vital to go through them in this ExpressVPN review and describe our experience with each.\nAdvanced Protection\nFor years, our team mourned the lack of an ad blocker or anything that would diversify ExpressVPN further. Well, we received Advanced Protection.\nSo, what does Advanced Protection offer? In short, it can block trackers, malicious sites, and ads. Bog-standard stuff, we can say. However, in our extensive test of ExpressVPN, Advanced Protection turned out to be much more effective than CyberGhost\u2019s basic ad blocker, for example.\nAnother point for this VPN is Parental Control. If you don\u2019t want your children to watch porn, you can block adult sites with a click of a mouse. After you connect to a VPN server, trying out, let\u2019s say, Pornhub, will result in an error message displayed below.\nParental Control passed our test with flying colors. We just wish that ExpressVPN listed blocked ads, trackers, and malicious sites anywhere so that we could see how effective it was. NordVPN\u2019s Threat Protection Pro does that, which is why we prefer it.\nProprietary Lightway (Turbo) Protocol\nThe Lightway protocol\u2019s release marked an important moment in ExpressVPN\u2019s history. This was a massive improvement compared to OpenVPN whose connection times were significantly longer. Lightway made the provider more responsive and snappy.\nThis protocol is the company\u2019s secret recipe. However, we know that it uses AES-256-GCM and ChaCha20/Poly1305 ciphers. The protocol became so popular that it\u2019s a default option in most cases, capable of delivering great performance, overcoming censorship, unblocking streaming sites, and so on\u2026\nYou\u2019ll see our speed test results with Lightway later on, proving that ExpressVPN is in the top 3 fastest VPN services of 2025. Lightway has UDP and TCP variants. UDP favors speed and reliability that includes post-quantum encryption for protection against quantum computers.\nWhen using UDP, users can switch from the two aforementioned ciphers or let ExpressVPN decide \u2014 the latter is our preferred choice. The TCP variant is slower but works in more \u201charsh\u201d conditions such as censorship and firewall restrictions.\nRecently, ExpressVPN introduced Lightway Turbo with multi-lane support, which endorses faster speeds and better connection stability. As said, you\u2019ll see its speed test results later on, using this very protocol.\nWe also tested OpenVPN TCP and UDP and must report that ExpressVPN\u2019s performance with this protocol is better than before. Unfortunately, OpenVPN can\u2019t compete with Lightway Turbo for the most part.\nTrustedServer Technology\nTrustedServer is the provider\u2019s vision of RAM-only servers, which we feel obliged to cover in this review of ExpressVPN for 2025. The company relies on Random Access Memory to host its servers. RAM is a volatile type of memory, which loses data with every power loss.\nWhen the company restarts the server or shuts it down for maintenance, it loses ALL data. This means no unnecessary information lingers on the server for long, thereby, preventing unauthorized entities from accessing it.\nTrustedServer Technology works according to ExpressVPN\u2019s highest security standards. The required software is reinstalled on every startup to ensure everything flows smoothly. This allows for easier maintenance and updates for optimal server operation.\nPrivate DNS Servers\nIn our years-long experience with this VPN, we haven\u2019t been met with any suspicions of our privacy breach. We can thank Private DNS servers for that. ExpressVPN relies on its own DNS servers to handle your DNS requests and prevent third parties from accessing them.\nMany low-cost VPNs use free or third-party DNS services instead. They\u2019re notorious for spying on your DNS queries and following your online footsteps as a result. However, a company like this would never allow for such abominable activities.\nLater in our review of ExpressVPN, we\u2019ll discuss its no-logs policy which is paramount to overall privacy. Its Private DNS servers adhere to the same policy.\nExpressVPN Keys\nNo matter the subscription plan you pick, you\u2019ll get this password manager.\nIs it any good? After trying out ExpressVPN Keys, we can say it\u2019s pretty good, but it\u2019s not yet up to the level of the best password managers. It does what it\u2019s supposed to. This is a browser extension for generating secure passwords and signing in to certain websites with a mouse click.\nYou can also use it on other non-PC devices, such as iOS or Android tablets and phones.\nIn this case, it will be in the app, letting you generate up to a few random passwords. The mobile version of this VPN also includes some features like WebRTC Leak Test, DNS Leak Test, and IP Checker that you won\u2019t find in the desktop app.\nIP and DNS Leak Test: Incredible Performance\nAfter we review ExpressVPN\u2019s features, it\u2019s time to see how all of them work in practice. There\u2019s no better way of checking whether the VPN works than testing it for IP and DNS leaks.\nWe first used a website called ipleak.net \u2014 the results are below:\nAfter our connection to a random US server, we noticed amazing results. Our IP and DNS addresses are fully concealed. Bear in mind we were in Europe at the time of writing this in-depth ExpressVPN review. Yet, there\u2019s no trace of our whereabouts here.\nAnother website we used is browserleaks.com, which also tests for IP address and DNS leaks thoroughly. Yet again, the results are awesome and are in line with our experience so far. During our 10-plus years of ExpressVPN usage, we had NO leaks, which is interesting.\nOur team of experts tested pretty much all 105 countries and many city-level servers as well. We\u2019ll repeat what we said a second ago \u2013 ExpressVPN does NOT leak your IP and DNS addresses.\nDoes ExpressVPN Keep Logs?\nExpressVPN is one of the most reputable VPN companies around. The company is stationed in the British Virgin Islands. Again, we\u2019re looking at a privacy-friendly off-shore country whose privacy laws are beloved by many. By that, we mean the lack of data collection.\nGovernment agencies in this country won\u2019t spy on users or require VPN companies to hand out sensitive data. This is in stark contrast to the US or Canada whose 5 Eyes indulgence breeds the opposite results. These countries are notorious for spying, collecting, and selling users\u2019 data.\nIn our ExpressVPN analysis, we should mention its parent company \u2014 Kape Technologies. Granted, its Crossrider days (ex-name of the company) weren\u2019t so gracious. However, Kape is another company these days and owns a myriad of top-tier VPN providers.\nSome of them are Private Internet Access (read our review here) and CyberGhost. Interestingly, none of these providers keep logs and both have at least one third-party security audit. Private Internet Access, in particular, is especially revered in the United States, which is the largest VPN market.\nEnough about PIA \u2014 does ExpressVPN store logs? Well, you can anticipate the answer. No, it doesn\u2019t. Our privacy policy analysis will tell you more about it, however.\nExpressVPN\u2019s Privacy Policy Review\nYou don\u2019t need to read the entire policy to know what\u2019s the deal. At the very start, ExpressVPN\u2019s open about its logging practices or the lack of them.\nIn short, the provider doesn\u2019t store information including:\n- IP addresses (originating and VPN-given IPs)\n- DNS requests (queries)\n- Browsing history\n- Traffic destination\n- Data content\n- Connection logs\n- Connection timestamps\n- Session duration\nAs you can see, the privacy policy is one of the best out there. The provider keeps it clean, as we like to say, by never storing a single bit of sensitive information on its RAM-only servers. Does it store anything? Sure. But everything is in an anonymized form.\nFor instance, some technical data is there for troubleshooting. The provider also must use your email to provide the service. Since it offers 8 simultaneous connections, it knows how many devices are connected at a time to enforce the limit.\nNeither of this information can be traced back to you \u2014 that\u2019s the point.\nAnother thing we like about ExpressVPN is its non-invasive logging for its Keys password manager. Namely, all data within the app is secured with zero-knowledge encryption, so no staff can access or retrieve your passwords and other data.\nProof of No Logs\nAfter the tragic assassination of Andrei Karlov, a Russian ambassador to Turkey, ExpressVPN\u2019s popularity was briefly boosted but not in a good light. Namely, the investigation brought the Turkish authorities to one of ExpressVPN\u2019s servers allegedly used to delete crucial information from the assassin\u2019s social media accounts.\nThe Turkish investigators seized the server and upon inspection, couldn\u2019t find any logs or information to aid their investigation. This was proof that the provider didn\u2019t store anything on its servers even way before the first audit of the no-log policy a few years later.\nHowever, it\u2019s sad that the proof was found in such a bizarre situation.\nThird-Party Audits\nHere\u2019s a fun fact \u2013 VyprVPN was the first provider to get a third-party security audit from Leviathan Security. However, ExpressVPN is the most audited service, which is extremely important to mention in this review. In total, the provider has 20+ audits. If you want to compare the two services in more detail, read the VyprVPN vs ExpressVPN showdown.\nThe first one was way back in 2018 by Cure53. This audit was performed on the browser extension. Quickly after that, in 2019, PwC audited TrustedServer technology. The latest audit was from Cure53, again, in 2024, and this time, Aircove routers were the subject of inspection.\nWe know we sped through many ExpressVPN\u2019s audits but discussing them would take hours. For your convenience, here\u2019s the list of an entire audit history from ExpressVPN\u2019s site:\nWe can see companies like Cure53, KPMG, F-Secure, and PwC. A quick Google search will tell you how powerful these independent audits are. Yet, time and time again, they had no problems verifying the company\u2019s claims about the provided security and privacy.\nExpressVPN Server Location Analysis\nNumbers-wise, ExpressVPN won\u2019t beat NordVPN, Private Internet Access, or CyberGhost. Compared to them, it offers \u201cjust\u201d over 3,000 servers. This number, however, isn\u2019t small by any means, considering that Hide.me and IPVanish have around 2,400 servers.\nExpressVPN\u2019s server fleet is of the utmost quality. It\u2019s scattered across 105 countries and at least 160 locations if we count city-level servers. Its US servers are amazing, for instance, and are available in 20+ locations, which is more than any other VPN.\nIt\u2019s no wonder this is among the most appreciated VPNs in America. The provider offers plentiful locations in countries like Canada, the UK, Australia, Japan, and even India. Speaking of India, virtual servers are used in this country for privacy purposes.\nThe majority of the network is based on physical RAM servers for the best performance. ExpressVPN offers dedicated IP addresses in 29 locations, which you\u2019ll also find in NordVPN or Private Internet Access, some of the best VPNs with dedicated IP addresses.\nExpressVPN prices its dedicated IPs at $3.99/mo per IP, which is a bit higher than the aforementioned two providers. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t include specialty servers, which is a huge miss in our book.\nMany times when we wanted to use MultiHop (Double VPN), we had to switch to NordVPN or Surfshark for that additional privacy edge. At least Lightway Turbo is supported on all servers, which is paramount to preserving the level of performance.\nSpeed Tests: ExpressVPN\u2019s Performance Evaluation\nApart from NordVPN, our experience showed that ExpressVPN is the fastest service around. Before we divulge our speed test results in this review, let\u2019s present to you our native internet speeds.\nAt the time of writing, we were in Belgrade, as displayed below.\nAs always, our ExpressVPN test was simple but rather time-consuming to ensure the best accuracy. We tested the VPN using 3 locations in Europe, the US, and Asia. For Europe, we selected the UK and for Asia, we went with Japan as the most popular location.\nEach test was repeated for 3 days in a row, 3 times a day. The following results display the best performance you\u2019ll get with ExpressVPN. Since the protocol selection was set to \u201cAutomatic\u201d, we enabled Lightway Turbo to give ExpressVPN the space to use it if it deems fit.\nUK Speed Test Results:\nUS Speed Test Results:\nJapan Speed Test Results:\nThe speed test results show us that ExpressVPN performs exceptionally well. Compared to NordVPN\u2019s NordLynx protocol, Lightway (Turbo) lags a bit. However, having in mind how far Japan and the US are from Belgrade (thousands of kilometers), the performance is respectable.\n| UK Server | US Server | Japan Server | |\n| Download Speed Loss | 18.6% | 34.4% | 42.7% |\n| Upload Speed Loss | 5.8% | 6.6% | 14.8% |\nThe same applies to upload speeds that didn\u2019t see a massive decrease overall. This is encouraging if you\u2019re a content creator and need stable upload performance to push out videos, photos, or anything else across different social networks.\nStreaming & Torrenting With ExpressVPN\nWe\u2019ll go over streaming and P2P performance in our in-depth ExpressVPN review. As said a while ago, the provider has no specialty servers like NordVPN or CyberGhost. Drawing from our experience, this isn\u2019t a big deal because all servers are capable enough.\nOur tests showed that it works with Netflix, for example. We tested numerous libraries from Europe, Asia, and the US. So far, ExpressVPN unblocked those from the US, Australia, the UK, Canada, Japan, Germany, France, and a few others.\nEnhance your online experience with ExpressVPN\nIn total, we unblocked 10-15 catalogs, making it an excellent choice for a change of region on Netflix.\nThe service also works with BBC iPlayer, MAX, and Hotstar thanks to a myriad of high-speed servers. Torrenting is another perk of ExpressVPN.\nIt has no dynamic port forwarding, dedicated P2P servers, and other tidbits. Instead, all servers are habitually optimized for torrenting and yours is just the selection. We recommend using the closest server possible to preserve the most performance.\nAs you see above, using uTorrent with ExpressVPN was a breeze. With our IP address hidden and our identity fully protected, we were ready to download just about anything. However, to avoid copyright infringements, we tested the provider by downloading Linux Mint.\nExpressVPN for Bypassing Censorship: Is it Efficient?\nDue to the simplicity of the provider\u2019s app, you\u2019d think obfuscation isn\u2019t there. But it is. ExpressVPN uses a built-in obfuscation that applies to each connection. As a result, the VPN quickly becomes suitable for bypassing firewalls and deep-packet inspection.\nThe burning question is whether it works in China in 2025. Well, according to our first-hand tests, it does. Much like NordVPN, ExpressVPN\u2019s reliability is at the highest level and you can expect stable and fast connections in this country. China isn\u2019t the only one, though.\nWe tested the provider in the UAE, Russia, Turkey, and other similar locations with great success. On rare occasions, we experienced connection problems in China that were resolved by using OpenVPN TCP or Lightway TCP. UDP isn\u2019t built for such demands.\nThe overall performance in censored countries is satisfying. For \u201clighter\u201d firewalls, the VPN will work 100/100 times. Therefore, if you need a VPN for school or the workplace to get over the network administrator\u2019s internet confinement, this is a fine pick.\nBypass censorship with ExpressVPN\nCustomer Support\nBefore the end of our comprehensive ExpressVPN review, let\u2019s discuss customer support.\nWe\u2019ve been using this service for years with an incredibly friendly relationship with the support team. Our experts love the easy-to-notice live chat widget on the site.\nSimply click on it, type in your message, and the provider\u2019s staff will come to your aid. It\u2019s very intuitive. The support team responds in 5-15 seconds, making it blazing-quick. We also appreciate its email support, which is surprisingly fast as well.\nInsightfulness and helpfulness are the two words we use to describe this company. If we factor in hundreds of guides and FAQs on the site, the level of support is staggering. ExpressVPN even has a YouTube channel for added transparency.\nIt\u2019s also present on social media where you can get in touch. No doubt, its state-of-the-art customer service will put to shame many rivals who still need crucial improvements in this field.\nConclusion\nExpressVPN is an extraordinary VPN if you want non-negotiable security and privacy. Yes, it IS worth a slightly expensive price in this regard, especially because of its trustworthiness and 20+ audits. You will pay slightly more, but you know what you\u2019re getting.\nWhile we think NordVPN is superior due to faster speeds, more concurrent connections, cheaper prices, and more advanced features, ExpressVPN is a close second. This provider exemplifies simplicity and power at the same time, which not many providers can achieve.\nIt also brings to the table things like TrustedServer Technology, Lightway Turbo, Advanced Protection, and multiple independent audits. All of this, combined with reliable streaming and P2P, the ability to work in China, and 24/7 customer service, makes this service a joy to use.\nWe must point out a few flaws that we\u2019d love to see rectified in the future. ExpressVPN could benefit from MultiHop, perhaps malware protection, and a cheap 2-year plan that would dampen the price a bit (even a longer 3-year plan could work!). This would make the VPN much more affordable.\nNevertheless, even in this state, which is nearly perfect, this ExpressVPN review for 2025 ends on a good note."

      "text": "Calling a VPN service best-rated is easier said than done for us. Yet, when you read a typical review of NordVPN, people who tested it first-hand frequently refer to it exactly like that. Every NordVPN test yields excellent results, seemingly making it the #1 VPN service to use. NordVPN is a pretty familiar service. It\u2019s a product of Nord Security \u2014 a well-known company. This provider built its strong reputation around three concrete pillars; security, privacy, and performance. However, the service is much more than this.\nThink of a 360-degree app for online protection, which is an accurate representation of this software. It\u2019s clear as day that we\u2019re discussing a powerful VPN service with plenty of experience in the industry. After all, you don\u2019t need this NordVPN test to know what it is.\nHowever, if you\u2019ve never used it, this in-depth NordVPN analysis will come in handy. Our team has been using it since its inception and is living through its various stages of improvement. We noticed vast improvements to the formula, especially in the past few years.\nThis implies a surge of advantages that the majority of users will enjoy. However, no VPN is perfect and this one still has a few shortcomings. Before you shell out your money on it, read our exhaustive NordVPN review to see what our experienced team of experts thinks of it.\nNordVPN\nAfter testing several dozen VPNs, we can say that NordVPN is the best VPN of [year]. With excellent speeds, a user-friendly app, and many advanced features, you won't lack anything by opting for their service. Moreover, it won't even cost you much.\nPros\n- Multiple third-party audits\n- AES-256 bank-grade encryption\n- Robust apps for all platforms\n- Double VPN servers for added security\n- 115+ server locations to pick from\n- Affordable and generous 2-year plans\n- Faster than any VPN we tested\nCons\n- No website split tunneling\n- Occasional connection problems on Windows & macOS\nNordVPN Features: A Quick Rundown\n| \ud83d\udcb8 Starting price | $3.09 a month for 24 months |\n| \ud83d\udd16 Money-back guarantee | 30 days |\n| \ud83c\udf10 Protocols | OpenVPN, NordWhisper, NordLynx, IKEv2 |\n| \ud83e\udd78 No-log policy | Yes |\n| \ud83d\udcbe Servers | 7,600+ in 118 countries |\n| \u23f8\ufe0f Double VPN | Yes |\n| \ud83e\udda0 Malware/ad/tracker protection | Yes (in the Plus plan and above) |\n| \ud83d\udcfa Streaming and P2P | Allowed |\n| \ud83d\udcaf Third-party audits | Yes (Deloitte and PwC) |\n| \ud83d\udcbb Supported platforms | Windows, iOS, Android, macOS, Linux, and more |\n| #\ufe0f\u20e3 Simultaneous connections | 10 |\n| \u260e\ufe0f Customer support | 24/7 live chat, email, help center |\nNordVPN Pricing: How Much Does It Cost?\nBefore trying out NordVPN and discussing our test results, let us talk about its prices.\nWe know many of you are wondering about the NordVPN cost and whether it\u2019s expensive. We\u2019ll say only one word \u2014 no. Bear in mind that the provider doesn\u2019t have a \u201cfixed\u201d price.\nThis means it frequently offers different discounts and deals, often including several free months. Speaking of that, at the moment of crafting this in-depth NordVPN review, this service offers 3 free months for its 2-year plans.\nWe can see that the service exudes unbelievably low prices close to $3 a month. The Basic plan is a good starting point. However, the best value deal on this service is the Plus plan with a price of around $4 a month.\nWhy?\nBecause it offers malware protection, tracker/ad blocker, and a few other features we tested in this review. We appreciate NordVPN for being an all-around cybersecurity suite. With a VPN and malware protection, at this price, you\u2019re not getting better software anywhere.\nThe Complete plan comes with Nord Security\u2019s reliable NordLocker encrypted cloud storage. You\u2019re getting 1 TB, which should be ample. At under $5 at the time of writing, this plan is on par, price-wise, with ExpressVPN\u2019s least expensive 2-year deal. Should we add that it\u2019s better, too?\nMoney-Back Guarantee and Free Trial\nWhen it comes to a money-back guarantee, the Panamanian giant is more than generous. All plans are subject to a 30-day refund policy. This allows you to enjoy the provider for 30 days, or not enjoy it if you dislike it, and call it quits, being reimbursed at the end.\nIn our years-long NordVPN use, we always appreciated this feature. You can get a refund no matter the reason. Even if you just don\u2019t need the service anymore. Contact the support team through live chat, explain the problem, and voila!\nThe provider doesn\u2019t offer a full-fledged free trial, though. This refund policy is sort of a free trial if you plan to get a refund. However, Android users who sign up on their phones get a 7-day trial, which we ended up appreciating in our NordVPN review.\nPayment Methods\nIf you\u2019ve already read our test of NordVPN, or at least the gist of it above, you might want to purchase it. In that case, you\u2019re looking at four payment methods:\n- Credit/debit cards\n- Google Pay\n- PayPal\n- Cryptocurrencies\nPick one, snag a discount on NordVPN\u2019s 2-year plan, and enjoy.\nEase of Use & Compatibility\nTo be frank, we love NordVPN\u2019s apps. They\u2019re modern. Cutting-edge in a way. However, beginners might find them slightly intimidating with all of the unknown features at first. Rest assured, the provider\u2019s apps are some of the simplest around.\nOnce you\u2019re on the server list, it takes one click to connect to a server. NordVPN\u2019s hastiness lets you connect in 1-2 seconds and conceal your IP address from the prying eyes. The mobile app, as you see, looks the same, at least aesthetics-wise.\nWe love that mobile users get almost the same features, even including Threat Protection Lite. In our experience, both iOS and Android apps are optimized well. Both sides have access to all of NordVPN\u2019s protocols which we\u2019ll discuss in this NordVPN review for 2025.\nOn the compatibility side, the provider doesn\u2019t disappoint.\nOne curiosity is that it allows for 10 simultaneous connections, which is more than ExpressVPN and CyberGhost. Being a highly appreciated service by millions of users, the provider\u2019s supported devices/systems include:\n- Windows, macOS, and Linux computers and laptops\n- iOS and Android smartphones and tablets\n- Fire TV, tvOS, and Android TV systems (including Nvidia Shield TV)\n- Routers (Asus, pfSense, Tomato, DD-WRT, Netduma, \u2026)\n- Gaming consoles like Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox\n- Firefox, Brave, Edge, and Chrome extensions\nWe\u2019ll briefly touch on NordVPN\u2019s extensions which are some of the best around. They offer full WebRTC protection and VPN-like capabilities for streaming, torrenting, and safe browsing (location spoofing, for example). Now that we\u2019re at it, explore our favorite Chrome VPN extensions here.\nSecurity Features of NordVPN\nOne of the reasons you\u2019re reading this NordVPN review and test is that you want to know whether it\u2019s safe and secure. More than 10 years ago when we started to use it, we wondered the same. Yet, even then, we quickly concluded that its safety is undeniable.\nWe tested and evaluated all of its security features. The list is mile-long, so let\u2019s make haste.\nBasic VPN Features\nNordVPN\u2019s basic features are mandatory and include:\n- 256-bit GCM encryption. It\u2019s the strongest encryption in the world, unbreakable even by NSA-level hackers.\n- Perfect Forward Secrecy. The provider utilizes PFS, generating unique encryption keys for every connection. As a result, it\u2019s impossible to trace the connection and read its contents. Even if this happens, when the user disables the VPN, the encryption key is useless, as it won\u2019t be assigned to either of the forthcoming connections.\n- Kill Switch. A standard feature in every VPN. In our NordVPN test, it worked well with a few connection problems we encountered. It shuts down your internet traffic to prevent IP leaks if the VPN connection breaks. NordVPN even offers an app-level kill switch to apply the same effect to chosen apps. We explained how the kill switch works in a separate guide.\n- Split tunneling. It\u2019s here to route specific apps through the encrypted tunnel or prevent them from using a VPN. In return, you can encrypt only the traffic from the apps that would benefit from additional security or location change. No website split tunneling can be found, which our team isn\u2019t so happy about.\n- DNS Filtering. Once you enable it, NordVPN will block malicious sites and ads, as long as you\u2019re connected to the VPN server. However, we don\u2019t like that NordVPN doesn\u2019t list the blocked threats to inform you about whether it truly works. In our test, we couldn\u2019t tell whether it truly works for the most part.\nAdvanced Security Features\nOur NordVPN analysis is empty without advanced security features that the provider is so proud of. Keep in mind we tested the service using the Plus plan, which includes all of the core and bonus functions.\nSpecialty Servers\nA quality server network isn\u2019t all about numbers. Sometimes, it\u2019s the specialty servers that significantly boost the experience. The provider includes the following servers:\n- Double VPN. This is by far our favorite feature of NordVPN. We use these servers pretty much daily. They route your traffic through two servers in different countries for double the encryption. NordVPN offers pre-built Double VPN locations for easier access, including the US-Canada, Netherlands-Switzerland, and so on. Our experience shows that Double VPN servers are slower because of stronger encryption but they\u2019re still capable of streaming and high-speed downloads.\n- Obfuscated Servers. They use OpenVPN TCP and obfuscation to get over firewalls. We used these servers in China and other censored regions. They work well to bypass DPI and enjoy free internet in the harshest conditions. Read our NordVPN review further to see how efficient these servers were in practice.\n- P2P Servers. As implied by the name, these are made for safe and secure torrent downloads. They\u2019re also optimized for speed and stability and can take full advantage of NordLynx to squeeze out every drop of performance.\n- Onion Over VPN Servers. These servers are in the Netherlands and Switzerland. They\u2019re used for Tor Over VPN connections when you want to ensure additional anonymity and privacy. You can use them for going on the dark web safely, for example.\nThreat Protection Pro\nUsers will be interested in trying out Threat Protection Pro. Well, our experience yet again shows that this nifty little feature works extremely well. On iOS and Android, it\u2019s titled \u201cThreat Protection Lite\u201d but is almost the same feature. The best experience is on macOS/Windows.\nIn this scenario, you\u2019ll get three protection levels:\n- Anti-malware\n- Advanced browsing protection\n- Ad and tracker blocker\nThe first is our favorite, as it protects you against malware thanks to real-time scanning. Even better, NordVPN will display blocked threats to showcase its efficiency. We liked the option to exclude certain domains because some sites won\u2019t function with tracking disabled.\nOur team appreciates the URL Cleaner function too. It\u2019s a unique part of Threat Protection Pro that trims web addresses and removes tracking parameters for added privacy. File Protection prevents malicious downloads similarly to Windows Defender.\nIf you don\u2019t prefer Windows Defender and Microsoft\u2019s tracking policies, this is a better alternative in our book. Lastly, Vulnerability Protection (part of anti-malware) detects vulnerable apps on your device by scanning them multiple times a day.\nAs you can see, it detected one during our extensive testing procedure, which we promptly updated afterward.\nNordLynx & NordWhisper VPN Protocols\nThe reason we put NordLynx in this section is because it\u2019s an advanced security protocol you\u2019ll find nowhere else. A proprietary solution like this takes WireGuard as a base and expands upon it to create a superior protocol.\nNordLynx is WireGuard\u2019s improvement in security, privacy, and performance done by NordVPN. This makes the protocol extremely fast and responsive, allowing for second-long connection times for a snappy experience. One of the trademark features, mind you!\nAs you\u2019ll see in our speed test results later on, NordLynx is impressive performance-wise.\nNevertheless, apart from this protocol, the provider includes three more, such as:\n- NordWhisper\n- OpenVPN TCP/UDP\n- IKEv2 (manual setup)\nNordWhisper is the newest protocol made by NordVPN for overcoming network filtering. During our extensive NordVPN review, we found it pretty efficient after testing it on a few censored networks. The protocol selection isn\u2019t the widest but it\u2019s still excellent.\nOpenVPN and IKEv2 are ideal for security while being slower than NordLynx. However, OpenVPN TCP is used by Obfuscated servers to bypass censorship, so it\u2019s pretty handy in many scenarios.\nYou can find more info about NordLynx on NordVPN\u2019s site if you want to explore this reliable protocol.\nDark Web Monitor\nThe Dark Web Monitor tool is another worthy addition. We tested this feature simply by enabling it, and oh boy, we had a few interesting findings. This tool alerts you to public exposure of your data online. By that, we mean data linked to your email and passwords.\nThe app immediately showed us three websites where our data was compromised. For privacy reasons, we can\u2019t show them but we saw info such as our usernames, IP addresses, and passwords. After this NordVPN review, we resolved these issues thanks to this feature.\nMeshnet\nYou do not often find a VPN feature worthy of a separate article. Meshnet is one of them. To be clear, it\u2019s not a security feature but nonetheless, we found it incredibly useful in our NordVPN review. This feature is excellent for file sharing and remote access.\nUsers can link up to 10 personal devices and up to 50 other users\u2019 devices. In doing so, a safe and secure device network can be weaved, where you can share files, remote-control devices, and so on. We like the option to use another device\u2019s IP address.\nLet\u2019s say you want to unblock a restricted site. You can connect to a friend in another country who also uses NordVPN. Once he enables Meshnet, connect to their device and route your traffic through the device\u2019s IP address.\nNow, you can access the site that works in his country but not yours. Meshnet allows for remote access, as said, so that you can fetch a file from another computer or phone too. Oh, one more thing. Meshnet works on ALL supported systems, including iOS and Android.\nThis enables the remote control/access to phones or tablets. Pretty handy if you, let\u2019s say, forget your phone/tablet at home where you have important business files. Our team used Meshnet in this case to transfer these files and have them at our fingertips.\nRAM-Only Servers\nRandom Access Memory, also known as RAM, is a staple of every high-quality provider. Our rich experience showed that RAM-only servers are far better than those based on traditional HDDs. Performance, security, and privacy are elevated significantly.\nNordVPN bases all of its servers on RAM \u2013 quite amazing news! RAM servers wipe their data with each reboot, ensuring nothing is left. We found the provider\u2019s profound understanding of the importance of privacy baffling, which explains why it\u2019s so popular.\nCoupled with a no-log policy, RAM servers are another vital measure that prevents even NordVPN from keeping your private data around.\nPrivate DNS\nThe provider also uses Private DNS servers. Instead of using third-party DNS providers, the provider opts for a proprietary DNS server that adheres to the no-log policy. It means your DNS queries won\u2019t be monitored and stored on the server.\nLet\u2019s compare this to third-party options. Free DNS providers are notorious for storing your DNS requests, so when a VPN uses any of them, it negates its privacy features. Once you connect to NordVPN\u2019s server, your every step online is shrouded in a 100% secure VPN connection.\nNordProtect\nWe left this feature for the end before testing for IP/DNS leaks for a reason. It\u2019s available only in the Prime plan for users in the EU, the UK, the US, Canada, and Switzerland. It\u2019s a third-party tool for removing your private data from brokers\u2019 databases.\nUsers can buy it separately, but we recommend it as part of the Prime plan at under $7/mo for the 24-month plan. NordProtect can remove your private data from 170+ data brokers but this number will increase in the future.\nIf you care deeply about your privacy, it can be handy to wipe out your online footprints more thoroughly.\nIP/DNS Leak Test: No Leaks Detected\nIt couldn\u2019t be clearer that this is one of the top services for overall security. Our NordVPN test also showed the absence of IP and DNS leaks. We connected to a random US server and tested the service using two websites \u2013 ipleak.net and browserleaks.com.\nThe results above show the first website, where the provider completely concealed our original IP/DNS addresses and replaced them with the US counterparts.\nAgain, the second website showcases the same excellent results. Just to be clear, we tested all 118+ countries and had ZERO leaks with NordVPN. However, for the sake of simplicity of this review and test, we included a few screenshots.\nDoes NordVPN Keep Logs?\nDo you want a short or long answer? Here\u2019s the short one \u2013 NO. The provider is based in one of the most privacy-friendly jurisdictions: Panama. We all know Panama as an off-shore location whose privacy laws are way different than those in the US or the UK.\nIt\u2019s a country far away from the 5 Eyes, as well. Nord Security is a reputable company too, unlike Gaditek which owns PureVPN. Judging only by these factors, the provider isn\u2019t forced into storing logs and tracking your online footsteps.\nBut is this truly the case? Let\u2019s review the privacy policy of NordVPN.\nNordVPN\u2019s Privacy Policy Review\nOn its site, the provider claims not to keep any logs. This rings true in the privacy policy too. When it comes to the information that isn\u2019t kept, it includes:\n- IP address\n- DNS requests\n- Browsing history\n- Used bandwidth\n- Traffic logs\nThis is enough to conclude and confirm its no-logs practices. Of course, every provider must store at least something to function properly. When you use NordVPN, it will store your username and a timestamp of the last session status. Justifiably so.\nThis information helps the provider enforce its simultaneous connection limit and is wiped 15 minutes after the connection has stopped. Other stored information includes server load, and anonymized data, such as device information, active subscriptions, and so on.\nNow, using other non-VPN features is another story \u2014 the one we must clarify in this NordVPN review. Threat Protection Pro, for example, must scan visited URLs and apps on your device if you\u2019re using Vulnerability Protection or File Protection.\nThe good news is that the provider doesn\u2019t directly store this information. Instead, it\u2019s either briefly on the server in an anonymized form or isn\u2019t stored at all and is quickly wiped. How can we confirm this, you might be wondering.\nThird-Party Audits\nWith a third-party security audit! NordVPN currently has a few of them, coming from PwC and Deloitte. At the time of testing the service for this NordVPN review, the service counts four of them in 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2023 \u2014 there will likely be more.\nIndependent audits like these are important for trustworthiness. In this case, PwC and Deloitte audited not only a no-log policy but various security features, infrastructure, and so on. With pristine results on its hands, NordVPN is a paramount VPN for overall privacy.\nNordVPN Review: Server Locations\nPeople usually associate the provider\u2019s size with quality. While this isn\u2019t always the case, NordVPN\u2019s larger server fleet indeed brims with reliability and sublime performance. With over 7,600+ servers in 118 countries, it\u2019s hard not to be impressed.\nThe provider uses RAM servers, as explained, but Dedicated IPs are there too. It\u2019s good to have Smart DNS addresses as well. They\u2019re nifty for streaming and let you unblock streaming portals without installing the VPN.\nNordVPN\u2019s server selection is stellar because it covers all continents. For example, you\u2019ll find VPN servers in the UAE, which aren\u2019t present in ExpressVPN. We like the addition of Indian servers, which weren\u2019t there just a few years ago.\nHowever, the provider introduced a handful of virtual servers to ensure it covers \u201cinconvenient\u201d VPN locations. All of this means you\u2019ll never find yourself searching for a VPN location and not finding it. That\u2019s how you make a ubiquitous, worldwide server network.\nSpeed Tests: NordVPN\u2019s Performance Evaluation\nThe user experience with a VPN mostly depends on its performance. Our in-depth NordVPN review contains several speed test results we want to share with you, as we think they\u2019re some of the most brilliant.\nBefore we move on, let us show you our native internet speed in Southeastern Europe (Belgrade):\nOur team tested NordVPN across multiple locations \u2014 near and distant. We also repeated these tests 3 times a day, for 3 days in a row. For convenience, we tested 3 popular locations in Europe (the UK), the US, and Asia (Japan) \u2014 the results are below:\nUK Speed Test Results:\nUS Speed Test Results:\nJapan Speed Test Results:\nAll tests were done using the \u201cAuto\u201d option for protocol selection. We don\u2019t need to analyze the speed test results that much. NordVPN is faster than other providers we tested, displaying an imposing level of performance and low latency across all three locations.\n| UK Server | US Server | Japan Server | |\n| \ud83d\udd3d Download Speed Loss | 5.35% | 14.5% | 34.8% |\n| \ud83d\udd3c Upload Speed Loss | 5% | 6.8% | 9.1% |\nFor convenience, we added a small table that displays NordVPN\u2019s speed losses for each server location in percentages. You can notice just how little the provider loses, even on very distant servers.\nTake Japan as an example \u2014 it\u2019s more than 13,000 kilometers (8,000+ miles) away from our location!\nStreaming & Torrenting With NordVPN\nNordVPN exemplifies a provider whose streaming and torrenting abilities should be top-tier. During our 10-plus-year use, we rarely had any problems in this regard. To ensure this is the case, our team\u2019s NordVPN review meant that we would test it once again for you.\nAs expected, the results were amazing. We managed to access at least 30 Netflix libraries, such as those from the US, the UK, Canada, Japan, and many European catalogs. Platforms like BBC iPlayer and Hotstar also work flawlessly and without buffering.\nStream Content Freely With NordVPN\nThis applies to obfuscated servers too, whose VPN connection masking provides total anonymity necessary to get over certain geo-blocks. We must say it\u2019s superior to CyberGhost and its dedicated streaming servers that can \u201cglitch\u201d and not work occasionally.\nNordVPN sings the same catchy tune in P2P situations. Torrenting is extremely easy. Connect to a P2P server, open your Torrent client, and you\u2019re set. The provider is fast, reliable, and easily configurable so that torrenting is uninterrupted.\nWe need to mention that NordVPN can be bound directly to torrent clients with a SOCKS5 proxy, as explained in this guide. So overall, it\u2019s capable of delivering entertainment to your doorstep with a click of a mouse.\nIf your idea of entertainment is exploring the dark web, you can use its Onion Over VPN servers too. However, even \u201cnormal\u201d servers will work for all your activities.\nUsing NordVPN for Bypassing Censorship\nPeople are quickly deterred from visiting the Great Wall or the Bund because of the Great Firewall. The latter isn\u2019t a popular Chinese monument but rather an annoyance that blocks websites and imposes censorship on the country\u2019s online space.\nPeople use VPNs in this country but to no avail, as most don\u2019t work. Thanks to our numerous testers in China, our team discovered that NordVPN works in 2025. Its Obfuscated servers are powerful enough to bypass deep-packet inspection and provide unlimited internet access.\nBetter yet, NordVPN\u2019s speeds in China are stable and fast. Another point for NordVPN is its ability to work in other censored regions. After trying out this provider in the UAE, Turkey, Qatar, Russia, and other countries, we found that it works without a hitch.\nBrowse the Internet Freely With NordVPN\nCustomer Support\nDid you know that NordVPN is the largest VPN company right now? Well, a part of its gargantuan budget is devoted to staggering customer service, which we must praise in this NordVPN review for 2025. What can you expect? 24/7 live chat support, for example!\nIt\u2019s there for you at any moment, showcasing helpfulness and user-friendliness. Email support is another option and might we add, it\u2019s VERY quick to respond. The company is ever-present on YouTube and other social networks for added accessibility.\nIf you\u2019re shy and avoid communication like a proper introvert, don\u2019t panic. FAQs and guides are on the site, explaining everything you\u2019ll want to know. We especially like its setup tutorials for every device under the big yellow ball called Sun.\nYou\u2019ll learn how to install a VPN on your iPhone, router, PlayStation, and so on. With multiple support channels across different platforms, NordVPN will gladly and swiftly solve any problems you might have as a newcomer.\nNordVPN Review: The Final Verdict\nWith this in-depth review of NordVPN coming to an end, we\u2019ll gladly digress on the analysis we performed. This is a great all-around service whose improvements never cease to amaze new and existing users. Recent improvements, in particular, made it much better.\nNordVPN\u2019s status as the most powerful provider is justifiable. It offers top-tier performance, unbeatable privacy and security, excellent compatibility, plenty of server locations, and state-of-the-art streaming/torrenting abilities.\nWhat are its shortcomings?\nTo be 100% honest, there aren\u2019t many. We dislike the lack of website split tunneling, for instance. New users complain about NordVPN\u2019s complexity, which can be the case for first-time users who find the feature-filled apps a tad overwhelming.\nSome users reported occasional connection issues on Windows and macOS. For us, that was rarely the case. Curiosity was also a security breach in 2018 on one server, which the provider patched promptly without consequences, receiving multiple third-party audits shortly after.\nSo, after this comprehensive review of NordVPN, only one question remains.\nShould you buy and use NordVPN? Our team confidently says yes."

      "text": "Switzerland is known for its stringent privacy laws, making it one of the best legal jurisdictions for a VPN. In today\u2019s Proton VPN review for 2025, we\u2019re discussing one such provider. Proton VPN is renowned for its privacy-oriented nature and robust security.\nHowever, the provider made some significant improvements in the past few years. Apart from its obvious advantages, the VPN offers plenty of servers, great performance, streaming, torrenting, and many more. Does it make it comparable to some of the top names, though?\nBefore we move on to our in-depth Proton VPN review, we must admit that it is one of our favorite options. Its privacy is on par with the best options like NordVPN and ExpressVPN. Additionally, it offers a handy free VPN plan that will undoubtedly attract many users.\nOverall, Proton VPN seems like a complete package. This rings even truer considering its father company Proton which offers a few more security tidbits that you can get along with the VPN service. In today\u2019s Proton VPN analysis, we\u2019ll review its offerings and answer the question of whether you should buy and use it.\nProton VPN\nIf you need a mighty VPN with non-negotiable privacy and plenty of servers, Proton VPN might just scratch that itch. It's a solid service overall, ultimately let down by its average performance and inability to work in China.\nPros\n- Secure Core servers are incredibly safe\n- Open-source applications\n- 12,600 servers in 117+ countries\n- It can unblock Netflix US\n- Free plan with unlimited bandwidth\nCons\n- Proton VPN isn't working in China\n- Not the best speeds\nProton VPN Pricing: How Much Does It Cost?\nWe\u2019ll start this Proton VPN review on a, let\u2019s say, good note \u2013 its price. The service offers a great free plan that we\u2019ll mention later but it\u2019s primarily a premium provider.\nThe price you\u2019ll pay for it is worthy of the \u201cPremium\u201d badge too given the VPN\u2019s qualities we\u2019ll discuss later in this review. Here\u2019s how much it costs at the moment.\nLook at the so-called \u201cRecommended\u201d deal from Proton VPN. It\u2019s a 2-year plan that costs $3.59/mo. You\u2019ll be billed upfront around $86.11 for the first 24 months. Absurdly, the 12-month plan is dangerously close price-wise to the 24-month deal.\nAs you can see, it\u2019s just under $4 or around $48 for the first 12 months. The 24-month plan is very similar to NordVPN\u2019s equivalent which costs just over $3 a month. Yet, NordVPN is in many ways superior to Proton VPN, even security-wise.\nWe also must mention the renewal price, which is way higher. Once the initial deal expires, Proton VPN charges you around $80 a year, which is around $6.67/mo. This is an identical price to ExpressVPN\u2019s annual deal, which, as you can guess, is another superior service.\nLet\u2019s check out its business VPN plans. Proton doesn\u2019t only offer a VPN here. Users can enjoy its Mail & Calendar, Drive, and Pass. To translate, we\u2019re talking about an email service, cloud storage, and a password manager.\nThese three can be obtained along with the VPN in the Proton Unlimited subscription.\nIt\u2019s a bit costlier, though, and the VPN Essentials plan will cost you at least $6.99/mo, with the VPN Professional plan being a speck under ten bucks \u2014 $9.99/mo. In a bit, you\u2019ll find out if Proton VPN is worth the asking price based on our experience with it (spoiler alert: it is).\nMoney-Back Guarantee and Free Trial\nProton VPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee for all plans, including the monthly one.\nThere\u2019s no free trial, however, so you must either buy it immediately or test it first using a free plan. Speaking of which, we mentioned it earlier in our Proton VPN review.\nThis plan offers unlimited traffic and is almost equally secure to the paid option. However, because you\u2019re paying nothing, some corners have been cut. Proton VPN doesn\u2019t let you pick the server location, so you\u2019re locked to one \u201cFastest\u201d server.\nHowever, it offers 5 countries \u2014 the US, the Netherlands, Japan, Poland, and Romania and automatically connects you to one of these based on your location.\nAnother issue is slow speed, which can ruin your day on many occasions. The free plan isn\u2019t streaming-optimized, it blocks P2P traffic and lacks features like Secure Core servers, Port Forwarding, NetShield, and others, all of which are mentioned in our test below.\nPayment Methods\nProton doesn\u2019t offer plentiful payment methods and we don\u2019t like that, although it has enough. You can pay using credit or debit cards and PayPal. For a VPN that prides itself on being a privacy giant, not offering crypto payments would be crazy. Luckily, it does.\nYou can, however, pay only with Bitcoin, but we won\u2019t be annoying nitpickers. Frankly, we use PayPal for our VPN purchases but if you\u2019re a privacy geek and want everything under control, you\u2019ll lament the lack of your beloved cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Dash, Monero, etc.\nEase of Use & Compatibility\nAfter trying out its apps, our team was pleasantly surprised with how capable they are. All Proton VPN\u2019s apps look stunning and grace us with their presence on all devices. The screenshot below shows you its Windows app, which looks modern and sleek.\nThe situation is the same with mobile apps that support one-tap connections and are snappy and quick. We must praise Proton VPN\u2019s support for Linux. It\u2019s the best VPN for Linux with a proper GUI, which lets even beginners use the service without issues.\nProton VPN\u2019s device compatibility is great overall and users can install it on:\n- Windows, macOS, and Linux computers and laptops\n- Android and iOS tablets and phones\n- Gaming consoles (PS, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, \u2026)\n- Routers (pfSense, AsusWRT, DD-WRT, FreshTomato, MikroTik, OpenWRT, Vilfo, \u2026)\n- TVs (Android Smart TV, Nvidia Shield TV, Firestick TV, Apple TV, Chromecast, \u2026)\nThe provider supports both OpenVPN and WireGuard on routers too. However, you need a WireGuard-friendly router in this case. Simultaneous connections are its forte and you\u2019ll find 10 of them in all plans, except for the free one that offers 1.\nCompared to CyberGhost, Proton VPN offers 3 more simultaneous connections but is on par with NordVPN. For more concurrent connections, you can use Private Internet Access or Surfshark. They offer no limits in this regard and even cost a bit less.\nSecurity Features of Proton VPN\nSo now, we move on to the Proton VPN review of security features. This, we believe, will be the most interesting part of our test. Our team has been with Proton VPN since its inception so we witnessed some interesting improvements in this field.\nWe love how the provider progressed and its trajectory is indeed going in the right direction. Here\u2019s what we think of its security features based on our first-hand experience.\nBasic VPN Features\nWhen it comes to basic features, Proton VPN is no slouch. Like its popular rivals, many of which we mentioned so far, it includes well-known features, such as:\n- 256-bit encryption. As you likely know, it\u2019s the most powerful encryption in the world. Being impenetrable by brute force, worldwide authorities and the military use it to keep their vital information confidential.\n- Automatic Kill Switch. A standard VPN feature that shuts down the internet if the VPN connection drops to prevent IP leaks. There\u2019s even the \u201cPermanent\u201d version which prevents you from going online unless you connect to a VPN. In our Proton VPN test, the kill switch worked well amidst very few connection problems we experienced.\n- NetShield. It\u2019s an ad blocker that also blocks malware and trackers. We deem it a basic feature because it\u2019s easily enabled and works in the background. Sadly, unlike NordVPN\u2019s Threat Protection Pro, we discovered that it doesn\u2019t display blocked threats, which is a shame.\n- DNS and IPv6 Leak Protection. It needs no special explanation. When enabled, these two prevent the leakage of your DNS and IPv6 addresses.\n- Split Tunneling. It allows you to exclude or allow the apps or IPs to use the VPN tunnel. During our test, we used this feature for local banking and shopping sites where we didn\u2019t need to change our IP address.\nAdvanced Security Features\nProton VPN isn\u2019t all about numbers features-wise. NordVPN and Private Internet Access offer more, for example. However, Proton VPN is far from being underwhelming and the advanced features it offers are paramount for online privacy. They include:\nSecure Core Servers\nSecure Core servers are the highlight of Proton VPN. They\u2019re quite similar to Double VPN or Multi-Hop, and in the same fashion, they route your traffic through multiple servers before it reaches the final destination. As a result, no one can trace the origin of the traffic.\nThese servers offer additional encryption, as expected, and because of that, they\u2019re a tad slower. In our Proton VPN test, the speed reduction wasn\u2019t very dramatic but indeed noticeable. However, this isn\u2019t the goal of Secure Core servers.\nThe goal is to get you online anonymously and without snoopers breathing behind your back. Secure Core servers are stationed in hardened data centers in Sweden, Iceland, and Switzerland. They\u2019re used in pairs with \u201cnormal\u201d servers to establish a connection.\nFor example, you can select the US server via Iceland, Sweden, or Switzerland. This means your traffic will be routed first through one country and then the other before it reaches the destination. With two IPs and double the encryption, you\u2019re basically a ghost online.\nWireGuard Protocol\nFrom our experience with Proton VPN, it works best when using WireGuard. However, the provider also has this Smart option, which automatically assigns you the protocol based on numerous parameters. In most cases, the provider will use WireGuard.\nAt least that was the case in our test. Some servers are more optimized for OpenVPN in which case, the service will opt for UDP or TCP. We noticed that UDP is slightly faster while TCP was great for overall reliability and sometimes bypassing firewalls.\nAlternative Routing (Stealth VPN on macOS)\nSince we mentioned firewalls, let\u2019s briefly talk about Alternative Routing. It\u2019s almost equivalent to Stealth VPN, which the VPN uses on macOS. In 2025, Proton VPN included an update where Stealth VPN now works on Windows, improving the service dramatically.\nAlternative Routing is your means of getting over firewall restrictions if you encounter blocking problems.\nThe main purpose is to get to Proton\u2019s sites if they\u2019re blocked but the provider claims it\u2019s also handy for general restrictions. We tested Alternative Routing in China but the results weren\u2019t so great. More about that near the end of our in-depth review of Proton VPN.\nWhat about Stealth VPN which now works on Windows and macOS? Again, it\u2019s not as great as you expect it to be, and while it does work in the case of many firewall restrictions, the Great Firewall will be an unbeatable obstacle.\nStealth VPN, however, masks your VPN connection and makes it look like a normal connection instead. It\u2019s handy if you are in school or the workplace and want to circumvent stubborn network restrictions. In this scenario, it works perfectly fine.\nDark Web Monitoring\nDark Web Monitoring isn\u2019t an in-app feature. It\u2019s instead found if you log in to your account from the website. You can, from here, enable Dark Web Monitoring with a simple click and protect your private information from public eye exposure.\nIt works the same as the Dark Web Monitor from NordVPN or Alert from Surfshark. If your private information is exposed, the Dark Web Monitor informs you, letting you take action by changing your credentials if the email or password is endangered.\nIn our test, the tool found nothing because we used a new email address that we usually don\u2019t associate with anything else than VPNs.\nPrivate DNS\nPrivate DNS servers are used by Proton VPN for added privacy. They handle your DNS requests and prevent third-party DNS services from seeing them. For added customization, the provider allows you to use a custom DNS server.\nHowever, after trying out a few, we can tell you from experience that Proton VPN\u2019s DNS is the best option. You have to really trust a specific DNS to use it and since most of them will track you in some way and store your sensitive data, this isn\u2019t the smartest option.\nAs you\u2019ll see soon in this Proton VPN review, the provider\u2019s no-logging policy is perfect, so you can be sure nothing is stored on its servers.\nPerfect Forward Secrecy\nForward Secrecy also known as Perfect Forward Secrecy or simply PFS, is another feature worth mentioning. Proton VPN prides itself on using this feature to protect you against data breaches by assigning unique encryption keys to each connection.\nOne connection with a specific encryption key will be unique, and once the connection is stopped, the encryption key is deleted and never used again. Even if the encryption key is compromised, which is impossible to happen, it would be useless, as a result.\nFull-Disk Encryption\nAs expected from a privacy-focused service, Proton VPN\u2019s server technology is impressive. Like other similar providers, it uses RAM to host its servers. Apart from that, the service went a step ahead to secure all of its servers with full-disk encryption!\nThis allows the provider to store config files and server certificates on the exit server to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. The attacker can\u2019t steal the server certificate and compromise the server as a result, making Proton VPN\u2019s servers \u201cbulletproof.\u201d\nThese servers aren\u2019t used in all countries. Instead, Proton VPN reserved them for high-risk countries with frequent data breaches and surveillance. For instance, one such country is Russia, where the authorities are notorious for anti-privacy practices.\nIP and DNS Leak Test Results: Ironclad Security\nAn integral part of our review of Proton VPN is an IP/DNS leak test. We performed quite a few, testing all 115+ countries that the VPN offers. For the sake of simplicity, we\u2019ll show you our test results with the US server, which were, by the way excellent.\nThe screenshot above shows us the first Proton VPN test, which was performed on ipleak.net, a famous IP/DNS Leak Tester. You can see only US IP addresses here and no trace of our native IP or DNS, which was in Europe at the time.\nUsing another website, browserleaks.net, yielded excellent results too. Once again, we faced no leaks, as Proton VPN effortlessly preserved our privacy and ensured much-needed anonymity expected from this company.\nDoes Proton VPN Keep Logs?\nWhen we discovered that Proton VPN doesn\u2019t store logs, we were all but surprised.\nAfter examining its background, the surprise factor dwindled further. We explained that the VPN is from Switzerland, a country with privacy laws so strong, that the authorities can\u2019t and won\u2019t impose logging obligations on the VPN services.\nInterestingly, another provider, PrivadoVPN, is also from this country.\nThis VPN is another no-log option with extremely strong privacy and security. So, this is no accident. Proton VPN\u2019s father company is Proton \u2014 again, a Swiss cybersecurity giant. More impressively, the provider\u2019s VPN apps are open-source, which adds to transparency.\nWe have three important factors \u2014 a Swiss jurisdiction, Proton, as a reputable company, and its open-source nature. All three are already screaming security and privacy, ensuring us that a VPN like this would never store logs. You\u2019d be a fool for not trusting this company.\nProton VPN\u2019s Privacy Policy Review\nThe first glance at the privacy policy gave us goosebumps. It\u2019s so short, yet so concise. The privacy policy states that Proton VPN doesn\u2019t keep any logs of your:\n- IP address\n- DNS requests\n- Visited websites\n- Traffic and communications\n- Session length\n- Location-based information\nLogging is extremely minimal and Proton VPN will store only the necessary data for the service to function. This data includes your email address and basic payment information, which must be familiar to the provider for it to work.\nProton VPN has proven its claims in 2019 in a legal case in which it was ordered to hand out the collected logs to identify a user. The company couldn\u2019t comply because it held no logs on its servers. Besides, let\u2019s not forget its open-source apps.\nCybersecurity experts can, if they want, examine all of them and get proof of the provider\u2019s security and privacy. However, we don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary given its outstanding reputation among people online.\nThird-Party Audits\nOur Proton VPN analysis of the privacy policy is nearly done \u2014 we have to mention its independent audits. In 2023, a famous auditor called Securitum audited the provider\u2019s no-logging policy. Securitum is, not to forget, founded by CERN scientists.\nThis is a well-respected company consisting of experts in the cybersecurity field. Earlier in 2020, the provider had another independent audit from SEC Consult on its apps for Windows, Android, macOS, and iOS. All four received praise from SEC Consult.\nFor all the reasons we have mentioned, Proton is an excellent no-logs VPN.\nProton VPN Review: Server Locations\nWith its server fleet constantly expanding, Proton VPN has arrived at quite an imposing number of around 12,600+ servers in 117+ countries. This server network is far larger than that of ExpressVPN, Surfshark, and even NordVPN, which is a commendable result.\nRegardless, this is one of the most impressive server parks we\u2019ve tested. Bear in mind that these are RAM-only 10 Gbps servers too. In addition, the server variety is impressive, as Proton VPN offers specialty servers for:\n- Streaming\n- P2P/Torrenting\n- Tor Over VPN\nThe latter are welcome for using Tor and venturing into the dark web, for instance. The former two are typical for premium providers such as CyberGhost or NordVPN. We mentioned Secure Core servers earlier and currently, there are 117 of them in 68 countries.\nAfter trying out the majority of server locations, we found that the server distribution is phenomenal. Namely, Proton VPN has nearly 3,200 servers in the US, which is considerably more than CyberGhost. Also, it offers locations in many censored regions.\nThey include Russia, the UAE, Turkey, India, and so forth. So even if you\u2019re a very demanding user, finding a server location that suits your needs will be pretty simple.\nSpeed Tests: Proton VPN\u2019s Performance Evaluation\nIt\u2019s time to divulge our speed test results in this Proton VPN review. We\u2019ll begin by displaying our native internet speed without using a VPN. At the time of testing, we\u2019re in Belgrade, and after evaluating our connection on Ookla\u2019s Speed Test website, we received these results:\nOur team tested Proton VPN for 3 days in a row, 3 times a day by connecting to 3 server locations \u2013 the UK, the USA, and Japan. We also used the Smart protocol option, which meant that the VPN would automatically decide on the protocol it\u2019ll use.\nAll speed tests were performed with the VPN Accelerator ON, which can be found in the app. However, it doesn\u2019t have a huge impact, as you see below. These are our best-case results from the extensive 72-hour test.\nUK Speed Test Results:\nUS Speed Test Results:\nJapan Speed Test Results:\nBased on our tests and overall experience, we\u2019re satisfied with the provider. Its speeds aren\u2019t the best compared to NordVPN and ExpressVPN. However, the speed reduction isn\u2019t extremely dramatic in most cases.\nWe\u2019ve had an anomaly where the US server was faster than the UK server despite the former being farther from us (screenshot #2). This happened in all tests, by the way.\n| UK Server | US Server | Japan Server | |\n| Download Speed Loss | 51.6% | 23.9% | 65% |\n| Upload Speed Loss | 6% | 41.1% | 17.5% |\nIn practice, Proton VPN performed well, with stable connections and a lag-free experience. It\u2019s not particularly great for gaming but if you value this trait, again, you\u2019ll want to use NordVPN instead. Glance at our NordVPN speed test results here.\nStreaming & Torrenting With Proton VPN: How Good is It?\nThe presence of streaming and torrenting-optimized servers reassures us that the provider will be reliable enough for these purposes. Starting with streaming, our team had a solid ride within this Proton VPN review. Netflix worked if that\u2019s your concern.\nWe unblocked catalogs from the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK, while the Japanese library was a bit problematic occasionally. Our experts tested other platforms, such as Hotstar, MAX, and BBC, all of which would work flawlessly. Pluto TV is in this group too, as can be seen in the screenshot below.\nBy working flawlessly, we don\u2019t mean just unblocking the streaming service. The experience, in terms of smoothness, is also great, with only occasional buffering that would disappear after 1-2 seconds. Torrenting support is vital for Proton VPN as a premium service.\nWith or without its Port Forwarding function, torrenting is a breeze. We used a server in Serbia and downloaded Linux Mint in no time. The speed reduction was hardly noticeable, except for upload speeds that dwindled a bit.\nThis, after all, isn\u2019t too important for torrenting for many of you. In general, Proton VPN can be compared to the top-rated VPNs in torrenting but not in streaming. NordVPN is again better, unblocking 30+ instead of a few Netflix libraries like this provider.\nUsing Proton VPN for Bypassing Censorship\nIt\u2019s that time for the Proton VPN review where we\u2019ll discuss the uselessness of this provider\u2019s anti-censorship features. We\u2019ve teased you a bit about it but now, it\u2019s official. After testing the VPN in China, our experts discovered that it wouldn\u2019t work.\nOn Windows, we used Alternative Routing to no avail. On macOS and Windows, we used Stealth VPN with the same results. We then found this article on its website:\nThis article confirms that it\u2019s not working, as the provider itself admits it. If you\u2019re in China or planning to travel there, this provider won\u2019t be great. Consider NordVPN and its obfuscated servers that work incredibly well in China at the time of testing.\nExpressVPN and Surfshark also work well based on our tests. For more information, we have a guide on using a VPN in China successfully. In that guide, we also present you with a few of the most dependable providers for this country.\nCustomer Support\nProton VPN\u2019s customer support isn\u2019t the best around. If you haven\u2019t bought it yet, you\u2019ll be locked to email support, which can be pretty slow to respond. Only customers are allowed to use 24/7 live chat support, and by customers, we of course mean paid customers.\nSo again, if you\u2019re a free user, live chat support is a no-go. This is in stark contrast to Hide.me which doesn\u2019t exclude 24/7 live chat support from its free users. Whatever the case, live chat support is okay but not impressive. It is helpful enough.\nOn its site, you\u2019ll find a wealth of guides in the Support Center. They will help you set up the VPN, unblock streaming services, get a refund if needed, troubleshoot issues, and so on. The provider is available on other platforms, such as Mastodon and Reddit.\nReddit users often communicate with Proton VPN\u2019s developers and troubleshoot their problems. We found that the provider is very talkative on Reddit and ready to help and answer many feature requests.\nConclusion\nAt the end of our Proton VPN review, we\u2019ll answer the question from the start. Is the provider worth your money and is it any good? The latter question is easy to tackle \u2014 it is very good, yes. But is it worth your money? Well, that\u2019s a complex conundrum.\nAs a whole, we think Proton VPN has a lot of amazing things going for it.\nIt performs decently, offers solid security, and comes with some of the best privacy features we\u2019ve seen so far. Coupled with a robust server fleet and a free subscription plan, it\u2019s hard to find something overly negative about the provider.\nA few years ago, Proton VPN\u2019s price was the main problem but with the discount in place, it\u2019s very affordable for many. Its 2-year plan is in the price range of NordVPN and perhaps Surfshark\u2019s mid-tier plan. Unfortunately for Proton VPN, these two cheap VPNs are better.\nEven NordVPN, our #1 rated service is often a tad cheaper while offering more. To its detriment, Proton VPN isn\u2019t working in China, isn\u2019t the most capable for streaming, and doesn\u2019t come with more powerful features like Threat Protection Pro or Meshnet from NordVPN.\nIf you\u2019re infatuated by its privacy and want to pay for it no matter what, then, by all means, go for this provider. If you\u2019re more rational, you\u2019ll realize that NordVPN is better and usually costs less. Proton VPN, on the other hand, will beat most of its rivals on sheer privacy/security alone, which is what many users will appreciate the most."
