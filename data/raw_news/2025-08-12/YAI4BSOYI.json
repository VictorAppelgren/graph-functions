  "title": "Hims & Hers CEO sells $33 million in stock after a massive rally",
  "description": "",
  "content": "The company says the sales came from indirect holdings and were for 'tax and philanthropic purposes'\n\nHims & Hers sells compounded weight-loss drugs, among other products.\n\nShares of Hims & Hers Health Inc. have roughly doubled over the past year, and Chief Executive Andrew Dudum cashed in on the rally.\n\nThrough a trust, he sold about $33.4 million worth of his company's stock on Thursday, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission put out after Monday's closing bell. Dudum unloaded 660,000 shares at an average price of $50.58.\n\nShares of Hims & Hers (HIMS), which sells weight-loss, anxiety, sexual-health and other medications online, are off about 3% in afternoon trading Tuesday.\n\nDudum is still the largest individual holder of Hims & Hers' stock, owning about 8 million shares indirectly through various trusts and another 92,313 directly. Together, the stake is worth about $388 million based on current prices.\n\nThe CEO \"has not sold any of his personally held Hims & Hers shares,\" the company said in a statement. \"The referenced sales were indirectly associated with Mr. Dudum, outside of his personal holdings, for tax and philanthropic purposes. Andrew continues to hold his full personal stake and is committed to the company's long-term growth.\"\n\nThe stock has been on an impressive run since the start of 2024, rising 435% over that span. That's even as the stock has come down about 31% from its 2025 high achieved in February.\n\nHims & Hers has benefited from growing interest in weight-loss drugs, though it was dealt a blow earlier this year when Novo Nordisk (NVO), the maker of Wegovy, abruptly canceled a partnership between the companies. Hims & Hers still sells compounded, generic versions of weight-loss drugs and has been able to continue doing so while staying in compliance with Food and Drug Administration rules because the company offers customized versions of the drugs.\n\nRead: This shortcut to going public is making a comeback after an epic bust.
