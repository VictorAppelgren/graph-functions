  "title": "Philadelphia Eagles RB Saquon Barkley can\u2019t rush for 2,000 yards again. No way. Right?",
  "description": "Saquon Barkley is coming off arguably the best season ever by an NFL running back. Can the Eagles star rush for 2,000 yards again?",
  "content": "\u2022 Saquon Barkley had a record-breaking 2024 season, eclipsing 2,000 rushing yards and winning the Super Bowl.\n\u2022 He aims to repeat his 2,000-yard performance, a feat never accomplished twice by any NFL player.\n\u2022 The Eagles, with a mostly unchanged offense, are expected to maintain their run-heavy strategy under new offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo.\n\nSaquon Barkley is on the heels of arguably the best season ever by an NFL running back.\n\nBarkley became the ninth player ever to eclipse 2,000 rushing yards. He set an NFL record for most rushing yards in a season, including playoffs (2,504). His total rushing output of 2,504 yards made him the first player to amass over 2,500 rushing yards in a single season. And last but certainly not least, he hoisted the Lombardi Trophy after winning Super Bowl 59.\n\nIt's hard not to label Barkley as the NFL\u2019s top running back following his 2024 campaign.\n\n\u201cExplosive through the holes (and) great pad leverage. When he's running the play is never really over with him, because he knows to get in and out of holes (and) he breaks tackles,\u201d former NFL running back Shaun Alexander said of Barkley to USA TODAY Sports in a recent interview. \u201cHe's special. It's fun to watch.\u201d\n\nCan Barkley make history again in his second season as a Philadelphia Eagle? No player has ever rushed for 2,000 yards twice in a career.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to do it in general. It\u2019s only nine of us who\u2019s ever done it,\u201d Barkley told reporters this offseason. \u201cThe reason why it\u2019s hard to do it twice is because it\u2019s hard to do it the first time. It\u2019s a crazy thing to even mention with those guys. But for me, 2,000 yards isn\u2019t the goal. It\u2019s winning a Super Bowl and going out there and performing at a high level. I didn\u2019t come in with the mindset last year to rush for 2,000 yards. It kind of just happened. So just stay in the moment, take care of the little things, be consistent with my process, be obsessive with my process\u2026If it\u2019s in the cards again, it is. If it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nOdds are stacked against Barkley rushing for 2,000 yards again. On top of the feat never being accomplished twice by the same player, Barkley has three career seasons of over 1,300 rushing yards. There\u2019s also the obstacle that Philadelphia faces the fourth toughest strength of schedule in the NFL this season.\n\nBut the Eagles do have the personnel to once again have a powerful rushing attack.\n\nThe biggest change offensively is new offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo who takes over for Kellen Moore who departed to become head coach of the New Orleans Saints. Patullo, who previously served as the team\u2019s passing game coordinator from 2021-24, as offensive coordinator inherits a loaded offense.\n\nThe Eagles offense returns 10 of 11 starters from the squad that won Super Bowl 59. Philadelphia ranked in the top 10 in both run block and pass block win rate and had the league\u2019s No. 2 rushing attack last season.\n\nExpect the Eagles to continue to have a run-oriented offense under Patullo. With quarterback Jalen Hurts and Barkley leading the way, it\u2019s a proven offensive formula as they aim to defend their Super Bowl title.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new journey. It\u2019s a blank canvas. We are who we are. We have what we have. Regardless whether you win a championship or lose a championship, the next year you have to be able to reset have the right focus and pursue it with great intensity and great passion. I think that\u2019s where we are,\u201d Hurts said. \u201cWe have a new team, new individuals and we have a tightknit core that\u2019s been here throughout time. We just want to continue to build chemistry that we have.\u201d",

It\u2019s come a long way,\u201d Mahomes said in 2023 in advance of the game. \u201cTo be the first for something is pretty cool.\u201d\nPhiladelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts echoed the same sentiments.\n\u201cIt\u2019s history,\u201d Hurts said.\nFlip the calendar to the present. As the NFL gets ready to kick off a new year, a record 16 Black quarterbacks are slated to start Week 1 of the 2025 NFL season, breaking a record of 15 Black quarterbacks who started Week 1 of the previous season.\nBryce Young, Caleb Williams, Cam Ward, C.J. Stroud, Dak Prescott, Geno Smith, Hurts, Jayden Daniels, Jordan Love, Justin Fields, Kyler Murray, Lamar Jackson, Michael Penix Jr., Mahomes, Russell Wilson and Spencer Rattler. Half the NFL\u2019s starting quarterbacks in Week 1 are Black for the first time in league history.\n\u201cI said about a year and a half ago half the league gonna be Black quarterbacks before long. I said probably within the next five years, and it happened before five years,\u201d Doug Williams, the first Black quarterback to win a Super Bowl, said to USA TODAY Sports. \u201cIf you write the top quarterback in the league, I think majority of them would be black.\u201d\nMarlin Briscoe was the first Black quarterback to start in modern pro football history in 1968. Williams became the first Black quarterback to win a Super Bowl in 1988. Warren Moon was enshrined as the first Black quarterback to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2006. Mahomes and Hurts became the first pair of Black quarterbacks to start in the same Super Bowl in 2023. And in 2025, a record 16 Black quarterbacks are prepared to start Week 1.\n\u201cJust like last year and even the years prior, it just makes you proud to see the number just continue to keep rising. Because I know what that position used to be thought of for African Americans to be able to play, and I was part of that. It\u2019s great that the league and ownership and society and everybody is bought in and sees that these guys can play at a very, very high level, and they continue to keep giving them more opportunities,\u201d Moon told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cThe more opportunities they give them, they're turning them into a starting quarterback position. I love it.\u201d\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Tyler Dragon on X @TheTylerDragon."

If this newsletter isn't already getting conveniently delivered to your inbox, click here to subscribe. USA TODAY Sports is now on Bluesky! Give us a follow for more of our NFL content.\nThe 2025 NFL season kicks off this week (huzzah!), and here's a list the six Week 1 games I'm most interested in watching (games listed in chronological order) \u2026\n\u27a4 Dallas Cowboys at Philadelphia Eagles (Thursday at 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC) \u2014 This is the stand-alone season opener, of course we're going to watch! There will be plenty of fanfare surrounding the defending Super Bowl champion Eagles when the NFL kicks off its 106th season. The Cowboys? Not so much incoming hype for America's so-called Team after the blockbuster trade of the team's best player, Micah Parsons.\n\u27a4 Kansas City Chiefs vs. Los Angeles Chargers in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil (Friday at 8 p.m. ET on YouTube) \u2014 The first of a record seven International Series games this season features a team aspiring to ascend to the top of the AFC West against the team that has won nine consecutive division titles. How will Travis Kelce perform now that he's engaged (to pop icon Taylor Swift)?\n\u27a4 Pittsburgh Steelers at New York Jets (Sunday at 1 p.m. ET on CBS) \u2014 Quarterbacks Aaron Rodgers and Justin Fields against their respective former teams. Does the 41-year-old Rodgers still have anything left in the tank? What might the Aaron Glenn era present for fans of Gang Green? Not the weekend's meatiest matchup, but does offer some spice.\n\u27a4 Detroit Lions at Green Bay Packers (Sunday at 4:25 p.m. ET on CBS) \u2014 This matchup got extra juicy following last week's massive trade, which saw one of the league's best pass rushers land in a place that desperately needed help on the edge ... Green Bay. The Green and Gold faithful at historic Lambeau Field will be extra pumped up given Parsons' presence. The Lions come in with some questions, such as losing both of their coordinators in the offseason, but Detroit's own star pass rusher \u2013 Aidan Hutchinson \u2013 is back and that's also something to watch in this one.\n\u27a4 Baltimore Ravens at Buffalo Bills (Sunday at 8:20 p.m. ET on NBC) \u2014 The biggest game of the weekend gets the primetime showcase it deserves. Both the Bills and Ravens are taking aim at the Chiefs to be the American Football Conference's top team. Cue the sports talk hot takes in the \"Sunday Night Football\" post mortem. The winner will be hailed as the league's team to beat, while the loser is already in a disadvantage in terms of possible home-field advantage in the playoffs.\n\u27a4 Minnesota Vikings at Chicago Bears (Monday at 8:15 p.m. ET on ABC/ESPN) \u2014 We discussed the big season ahead for the back-to-back NFL Offseason Champion Bears. New head coach Ben Johnson needs to reel in Caleb Williams' hero-ball tendencies. For the Vikings, 2024 first-round pick J.J. McCarthy takes the reigns behind center after missing his entire rookie season. If McCarthy impresses (and Williams shows improvement), the NFC North could be the league's most intriguing division in 2025.\n\ud83d\udea8The USA TODAY pro football survivor pool is open for the 2025 season.
