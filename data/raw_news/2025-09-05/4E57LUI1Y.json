  "content": "BEIJING \u2014 Chinese leader Xi Jinping welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin as an \u201cold friend\u201d as the two held a series of meetings Tuesday at a time when their countries face both overlapping and differing challenges from the United States.\n\nRelations between China and Russia have deepened in recent years, particularly following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s unorthodox approach to the war has added a twist to the relationship but doesn\u2019t appear to have fundamentally changed it.\n\nPutin addressed Xi as \u201cdear friend\u201d and said that Moscow\u2019s ties with Beijing are \u201cat an unprecedentedly high level.\u201d\n\nIn a sign of the importance China places on the relationship, their formal meeting was followed by tea with top aides at Zhongnanhai, the walled complex that is the center of power in China with residences and offices for its top leaders.\n\nChina announced after the talks that it would begin offering 30-day visa-free access to Russian travelers starting later this month.\n\nThe talks come the day after both attended a summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in the nearby Chinese city of Tianjin, and the day before a grand Chinese military parade in Beijing to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.\n\nThe Soviet Union was neutral for much of the war in Asia, but provided assistance to China in earlier fighting against invading Japanese forces in the 1930s. It also declared war on Japan in the waning days of World War II and sent troops over the border into Japanese-occupied northeastern China.\n\n\u201cWe were always together then, we remain together now,\u201d Putin said.\n\nChina says it is neutral in the Ukraine war but has provided an economic lifeline to Russia by continuing trade despite Western sanctions.\n\nA memorandum was signed to build another natural gas pipeline to China, Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in Beijing, according to Russia\u2019s Interfax news agency.\n\nThe Russian state gas company also signed agreements with a Chinese state energy company to increase deliveries via existing routes, the news agency said.\n\nThe U.S. and the European Union have also put sanctions on Chinese companies that they say have abetted Russia\u2019s military industry.\n\n\u201cChina and Russia face the same problem and must work together to jointly cope with the pressure from the U.S.,\u201d said Li Xin, the director of the Institute of European and Asian Studies at Shanghai University of Political Science and Law.\n\nChina is also one of the main targets of Trump\u2019s taxes on imports, though he has backed down from what was an escalating tariff war and his administration has begun negotiations with Beijing on a trade deal.\n\nThe summit of the 10-member Shanghai Cooperation Organization brought Xi and Putin together with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who held separate talks with both leaders on the sidelines of the Tianjin meeting.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s steep tariffs on India and the tone coming from the White House have pushed New Delhi closer to China and Russia, though Modi will not attend China\u2019s military parade.\n\nXi has tried to position China as a leader of countries that feel disadvantaged by the U.S.-dominated, post-World War II order.\n\nAt the Shanghai Cooperation summit and again in his meetings with Putin, he proposed an initiative to build \u201ca more just and equitable global governance system.\u201d\n\nChina doesn\u2019t want to overturn the global order but change it so it better serves its interests, Li said.\n\n\u201cChina and Russia do not yet have the power to change the world order but they are constantly pushing for reforms that benefit them,\u201d he said.\n\nPutin and Xi held a three-way meeting with Mongolian President Khurelsukh Ukhnaa ahead of their talks. His landlocked country of grasslands and mineral resources is sandwiched between the two giants.\n\nPutin said in opening remarks that the three countries are good neighbors, with a shared interest in developing ties.\n\nIn 2024, Putin made an official visit to Mongolia, where the government ignored calls to arrest him on an International Criminal Court warrant for alleged war crimes stemming from the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAssociated Press writer Huizhong Wu and researcher Yu Bing contributed to this report.",
