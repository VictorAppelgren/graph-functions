Generate Key Takeaways\n\nBorder czar Tom Homan is not happy with South Park\u2019s latest episode mocking the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation plan by ridiculing Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.\n\nJoining Chris Cuomo on his News Nation show on Thursday evening, Homan remained straight-faced while talking about the satirical show\u2019s depiction of ICE recruiting unqualified citizens to conduct immigration raids while covering their faces in shame.\n\n\u201cI thought the parody was just in bad form and certainly, certainly bad timing,\u201d Homan said on Cuomo.\n\nHoman, who served as the acting director of ICE during Trump\u2019s first administration, said the show was wrong to poke fun at ICE agents who often wear face coverings, hats, and sunglasses to protect their identities.\n\nHoman claimed rhetoric that mocks ICE \u201cemboldened\u201d the \u201csmall percentage of the left\u201d who assault ICE officers to continue attacks. He claimed that assaults on ICE agents were up \u201cover a thousand percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s throwing Molotov cocktails or threatening ICE agents, or putting hands on ICE agents, they feel emboldened the more and more they see this bad rhetoric coming out,\u201d Homan said\n\nPublic reaction to immigration raids has mainly been adverse and spurred some attacks on ICE agents, including doxxing incidents in which people have shared information about the person behind the ICE uniform. Some ICE agents have also become targets of violent physical attacks and Molotov cocktail attacks.\n\nTo counteract incidents, ICE agents have tried to conceal their identities while on the job, and the federal government has used the National Guard or military to protect agents as they take suspects into custody.\n\nSouth Park\u2019s latest episode, titled \u201cGot a Nut,\u201d aimed at the Trump administration, in a similar manner to the season 27 premiere. This time, it critiqued the Trump administration\u2019s anti-immigration agenda.\n\nIn the episode, Noem is depicted as a dog-shooting law enforcement officer who asks ICE recruits to racially profile people while conducting immigration raids.\n\nMr. Mackey, the dim-witted guidance counselor at South Park Elementary School, decides to sign up to be an ICE agent to increase funding to the school, which has been reduced as a result of government cuts \u2013 a reference to the Department of Government Efficiency\u2019s work.\n\nThe joke is that ICE has low standards when hiring recruits.\n\nIn the episode, Vice President JD Vance is also featured as Trump\u2019s physically small sidekick.\n\nIn a statement from the Department of Homeland Security, a spokesperson said, \u201cWe want to thank South Park for drawing attention to ICE law enforcement recruitment. We are calling on patriotic Americans to help us remove murderers, gang members, pedophiles, and other violent criminals from our country.\n\n\u201cBenefits available to new ICE recruits include an up to $50,000 signing bonus, student loan forgiveness, and retirement benefits,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nHoman echoed the benefits of joining ICE on Thursday evening, saying that the agency chose to open up the opportunity to recruits because it was in such high demand.",

The Los Angeles Times and other outlets report the deal was worth $1.5 billion.\nIn the episode, Trump sues the town of South Park when its residents challenge the presence of Jesus Christ \u2013 the actual person \u2013 in its elementary school.\nJesus tells them they ought to settle.\n\u201cYou guys saw what happened to CBS? Yeah, well, guess who owns CBS? Paramount,\u201d Jesus says. \u201cDo you really want to end up like Colbert?\u201d\nCBS and parent Paramount Global canceled Stephen Colbert\u2019s \u201cLate Show\u201d last week, days after Colbert sharply criticized Paramount's settlement of Trump\u2019s lawsuit over a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview.\nCBS and Paramount executives said it was a financial decision to axe \u201cThe Late Show.\u201d\nThe efficiency of \u201cSouth Park\u201d production, and the brinksmanship of its creators, allow it to stay incredibly current for an animated series.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what next week\u2019s episode is going to be,\u201d Parker said at Comic-Con. \u201cEven just three days ago, we were like, \u2018I don\u2019t know if people are going to like this.\u2019\u201d"
