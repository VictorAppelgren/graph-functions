  "title": "ChatGPT's model picker is back, and it's complicated",
  "description": "GPT-5 was supposed to get rid of all the complicated AI models to choose from in ChatGPT, but that's not how it's panned out.",
  "content": "When OpenAI launched GPT-5 last week, the company said the model would simplify the ChatGPT experience. OpenAI hoped GPT-5 would act as a sort of \u201cone size fits all\u201d AI model with a router that would automatically decide how to best answer user questions. The company said this unified approach would eradicate the need for users to navigate its model picker \u2014 a long, complicated list of AI models that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said he hates \u2014 to pick a version of ChatGPT that offers the right kind of responses.\n\nBut it looks like GPT-5 is not the unified AI model OpenAI hoped it would be.\n\nAltman said in a post on X Tuesday that the company introduced new \u201cAuto\u201d, \u201cFast\u201d, and \u201cThinking\u201d settings for GPT-5 that all ChatGPT users can select from the model picker. The Auto setting seems to work like GPT-5\u2019s model router that OpenAI initially announced; however, the company is also giving users options to circumnavigate it, allowing them to access fast and slow responding AI models directly.\n\nAlongside GPT-5\u2019s new modes, Altman said that paid users can once again access several legacy AI models \u2014 including GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o3 \u2014 which were deprecated just last week.\n\n\u201cWe are working on an update to GPT-5\u2019s personality which should feel warmer than the current personality but not as annoying (to most users) as GPT-4o,\u201d Altman wrote in the post on X. \u201cHowever, one learning for us from the past few days is we really just need to get to a world with more per-user customization of model personality.\u201d\n\nChatGPT\u2019s model picker now seems to be as complicated as ever, suggesting that GPT-5\u2019s model router has not universally satisfied users as the company hoped. The expectations for GPT-5 were sky high, with many hoping that OpenAI would push the limits of AI models like it had with the launch of GPT-4. However, GPT-5\u2019s rollout has been rougher than expected.\n\nThe deprecation of GPT-4o and other AI models in ChatGPT sparked a backlash among users who had grown attached to the AI models\u2019 responses and personalities in ways that OpenAI had not anticipated. In the future, Altman says the company will give users plenty of advance notice if it ever deprecates GPT-4o.\n\nGPT-5\u2019s model router also appeared to be largely broken on launch day. That caused some users to feel the AI model wasn\u2019t as performant as previous OpenAI models, and forced Altman to address the problem in an AMA session on Reddit. However, it seems that GPT-5\u2019s router may still not be satisfying for all users.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not always going to get everything on try #1 but I am very proud of how quickly the team can iterate,\u201d wrote OpenAI\u2019s VP of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, in a post on X Tuesday.\n\nRouting prompts to the right AI model is a difficult task that requires aligning an AI model to a user\u2019s preferences, as well as the specific question they\u2019re asking. The router then has to make a decision on which AI model to send the prompt to in just a split second \u2014 that way, if a prompt goes to a fast responding AI model, the response can still be fast.\n\nMore broadly, some people exhibit preferences for AI models that go beyond fast or slow responses. Some users may like the verbosity of one AI model, while others might appreciate the contrarian answers of another.\n\nHuman attachment to certain AI models is a relatively new concept that isn\u2019t well understood. For example, hundreds of people in San Francisco recently held a funeral for Anthropic\u2019s AI model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, when it was taken offline. In other cases, AI chatbots seem to be contributing to mentally unstable people going down psychotic rabbit holes.\n\nIt seems OpenAI has more work to do around aligning its AI models to individual user preferences.",

      "text": "During a Reddit ask-me-anything session on Friday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and key members of the GPT-5 team were peppered with questions about the new model and requests to bring back its previous model, GPT-4o.\nThey also asked Altman about the most embarrassing \u2014 and perhaps funniest \u2014 snafu in the presentation, the \u201cchart crime.\u201d\nOne of the new features that GPT-5 rolled out is a real-time router that decides which model to use for a particular prompt, either responding quickly or taking additional time to \u201cthink\u201d through answers.\nBut multiple people in the AMA on the r/ChatGPT Reddit complained GPT-5 wasn\u2019t working as well for them as 4o did. Altman said the reason GPT-5 seemed \u201cdumber\u201d was the router wasn\u2019t working properly when it was rolled out Thursday.\n\u201cGPT-5 will seem smarter starting today. Yesterday, we had a sev and the autoswitcher was out of commission for a chunk of the day, and the result was GPT-5 seemed way dumber. Also, we are making some interventions to how the decision boundary works that should help you get the right model more often. We will make it more transparent about which model is answering a given query,\u201d Altman promised.\nStill, people on the AMA lobbied so hard to bring 4o back for Plus subscribers that Altman promised to at least look into that. \u201cWe are looking into letting Plus users to continue to use 4o. We are trying to gather more data on the tradeoffs,\u201d he wrote.\nAnd Altman also promised, \u201cWe are going to double rate limits for Plus users as we finish rollout.\u201d This should give people a chance to play and learn the new model, adopt it to their use cases without worry of running out of monthly prompts.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

The chart presented a lower benchmark score with a much taller bar.\nAltman didn\u2019t answer questions about the chart during the AMA, but on Thursday he did call the chart a \u201cmega chart screwup\u201d on X. Others noted the charts in the published blog post were correct.\nBut the damage was done. Jokes ensued about using GPT for charts in a corporate presentation. GPT-5 reviewer Simon Willison, who had early access and generally liked the model\u2019s performance, also pointed out that turning data into a table was \u201cgood example of a GPT-5 failure.\u201d\nIn any case, Altman promised fixes to the items that seemed to concern people the most. He ended the AMA with a promise: \u201cWe will continue to work to get things stable and will keep listening to feedback.\u201d"

      "text": "OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3, which was slated to be the company\u2019s next major AI model, in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a \u201csimplified\u201d product offering.\nIn a post on X on Wednesday, Altman said that in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that \u201cintegrates a lot of [OpenAI\u2019s] technology,\u201d including o3, in its AI-powered chatbot platform ChatGPT and API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to launch o3 as a stand-alone model.\nThe company originally said in December that it aimed to release o3 sometime early this year. Just a few weeks ago, Kevin Weil, OpenAI\u2019s chief product officer, said in an interview that o3 was on track for a \u201cFebruary-March\u201d launch.\n\u201cWe want to do a better job of sharing our intended roadmap, and a much better job simplifying our product offerings,\u201d Altman wrote in his post. \u201cWe want AI to \u2018just work\u2019 for you; we realize how complicated our model and product offerings have gotten. We hate the model picker [in ChatGPT] as much as you do and want to return to magic unified intelligence.\u201d\nAltman also announced that OpenAI plans to offer unlimited chat access to GPT-5 at the \u201cstandard intelligence setting,\u201d subject to \u201cabuse thresholds,\u201d once the model is generally available. (Altman declined to provide more detail on what this setting \u2014 and these abuse thresholds \u2014 entail.) Subscribers to ChatGPT Plus will be able to run GPT-5 at a \u201chigher level of intelligence,\u201d Altman said, while ChatGPT Pro subscribers will be able to run GPT-5 at an \u201ceven higher level of intelligence.\u201d\n\u201c[GPT-5] will incorporate voice, canvas, search, deep research, and more,\u201d he added, referring to a range of features OpenAI has launched in ChatGPT over the past few months. \u201c[A] top goal for us is to unify [our] models by creating systems that can use all our tools, know when to think for a long time or not, and generally be useful for a very wide range of tasks.\u201d\nBefore GPT-5 rolls out, OpenAI plans to release GPT-4.5, a model code-named \u201cOrion,\u201d in the next several weeks, according to Altman. Altman says this will be the company\u2019s last \u201cnon-chain-of-thought model.\u201d Unlike o3 and OpenAI\u2019s other \u201creasoning\u201d models, non-chain-of-thought models tend to be less reliable in domains like math and physics.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Reasoning models effectively fact-check themselves, which helps them to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. This fact-checking process incurs some latency \u2014 reasoning models take a little longer, usually seconds to minutes longer, to arrive at solutions. But they tend to be both more reliable and capable.\nChinese AI lab DeepSeek captured the world\u2019s attention recently with its R1 model, which matched o1 on a number of benchmarks. As opposed to o1, R1 is an \u201copen\u201d model under a permissive license, meaning it can be downloaded and used as developers see fit.\nIn recent social media posts, Altman admitted that DeepSeek has lessened OpenAI\u2019s technological lead in AI, and said that OpenAI would \u201cpull up some releases\u201d to better compete.\nGPT-4.5, or Orion, is said to have suffered a number of performance-related challenges and technical setbacks. Bloomberg, The Information, and The Wall Street Journal have independently reported that Orion has shown less of an improvement over its predecessor, GPT-4o, than GPT-4 did over GPT-3."

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions.

      "text": "ChatGPT fans are shredding GPT-5 on Reddit as Sam Altman responds in AMA (updated)\nGPT-5 is out, the early reviews are in, and they're not great.\nMany ChatGPT fans have taken to Reddit and other social media platforms to express their frustration and disappointment with OpenAI's newest foundation model, released on Thursday.\nA quick glimpse of the ChatGPT subreddit (which is not affiliated with OpenAI) shows scathing reviews of GPT-5. Since the model began rolling out, the subreddit has filled with posts calling GPT-5 a \"disaster,\" \"horrible,\" and the \"biggest piece of garbage even as a paid user.\"\nAwkwardly, Altman and other members of the OpenAI team had a preplanned Reddit AMA to answer questions about GPT-5. In the hours ahead of the AMA, questions piled up in anticipation, with many users demanding that OpenAI bring back GPT-4o as an alternative to GPT-5.\nWhat Redditors are saying about GPT-5\nMany of the negative first impressions say GPT-5 lacks the \"personality\" of GPT-4o, citing colder, shorter replies. \"GPT-4o had this\u2026 warmth. It was witty, creative, and surprisingly personal, like talking to someone who got you. It didn\u2019t just spit out answers; it felt like it listened,\" said one redditor. \"Now? Everything\u2019s so\u2026 sterile.\"\nAnother said, \"GPT-5 lacks the essence and soul that separated Chatgpt (sic) from other AI bots. I sincerely wish they bring back 4o as a legacy model or something like that.\"\nSeveral redditors also criticized the fact that OpenAI did away with the option to choose different models, prompting some users to say they're canceling their subscriptions. \"I woke up this morning to find that OpenAI deleted 8 models overnight. No warning. No choice. No \"legacy option,\" posted one redditor who said they deleted their ChatGPT Plus account. Another user posted that they canceled their account for the same reason.\nAs Mashable reported yesterday, GPT-5 integrates various OpenAI models into one platform, and ChatGPT will now choose the appropriate model based on the user's prompt. Clearly, some users miss the old system and models.\nIronically, OpenAI has also drawn criticism for having too many model options; GPT-5 was supposed to resolve this confusion by streamlining the previous models under GPT-5.\nSam Altman responds to the criticisms\nWhen Altman and the team logged onto the AMA, they faced a barrage of demands to bring back GPT-4o.\n\"Ok, we hear you all on 4o,\" said Altman during the AMA. \"Thanks for the time to give us the feedback (and the passion!). We are going to bring it back for Plus users, and will watch usage to determine how long to support it.\"\nAltman also addressed feedback that GPT-5 seemed dumber than it should have been, explaining that the \"autoswitcher\" that determines which version of GPT-5 to use wasn't working. \"GPT-5 will seem smarter starting today,\" he said. Altman also added that the chatbot will make it clearer which model is answering a user's prompt. OpenAI will double rate limits for ChatGPT Plus users once the rollout is finished.\n\u201cAs we mentioned, we expected some bumpiness as we roll out so many things at once. But it was a little more bumpy than we hoped for!\u201d Altman said in the AMA.\nGPT-5 is an improvement, but not an exponential one\nExpectations for GPT-5 could not have been higher \u2014 and that may be the real problem with GPT-5.\nGary Marcus, a cognitive scientist and author known for his research on neuroscience and artificial intelligence \u2014 and a well-known skeptic of the AI hype machine \u2014 wrote on his Substack that GPT-5 makes \u201cGood progress on many fronts\u201d but disappoints in others. Marcus noted that even after multi-billion-dollar investments, \u201cGPT-5 is not the huge leap forward people long expected.\u201d\nThe last time OpenAI released a frontier model was over two years ago with GPT-4. Since then, several competitors like Google Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, xAI's Grok, Meta's Llama, and DeepSeek R1 have caught up to OpenAI on benchmarks, similar agentic features, and user loyalty. For many, GPT-5 had the power to reinforce or topple OpenAI's reign as the AI leader.\nWith this in mind, it's inevitable that some users would be disappointed, and many ChatGPT users have shared positive reviews of GPT-5 as well. Time may blunt these criticisms as OpenAI makes improvements and tweaks to GPT-5. The company has also historically been responsive to user feedback, with Altman being very active on X.\n\"We currently believe the best way to successfully navigate AI deployment challenges is with a tight feedback loop of rapid learning and careful iteration,\" the company's mission statement avows.\nDisclosure: Ziff Davis, Mashable\u2019s parent company, in April filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.\nUPDATE: Aug. 8, 2025, 3:20 p.m. EDT This story has been updated with Sam Altman's responses from the Reddit AMA.\nCecily is a tech reporter at Mashable who covers AI, Apple, and emerging tech trends.

      "text": "OpenAI has launched GPT-5, a new flagship AI model that will power the company\u2019s next generation of ChatGPT.\nGPT-5, which was released Thursday, is OpenAI\u2019s first \u201cunified\u201d AI model and combines the reasoning abilities of its o-series of models with the fast responses of its GPT series. The next-generation model signals a new era for ChatGPT \u2014 and its creator, OpenAI \u2014 pointing to OpenAI\u2019s broader ambitions to develop AI systems that are more like agents than chatbots.\nWhile GPT-4 enabled AI chatbots to offer smart responses on a wide variety of questions, GPT-5 allows ChatGPT to complete a wide variety of tasks on behalf of users \u2014 such as generating software applications, navigating a user\u2019s calendar, or creating research briefs.\nWith GPT-5, OpenAI has also sought to make ChatGPT simpler to use. Instead of asking users to choose the right settings, GPT-5 comes equipped with a real-time router that decides how to offer the best answer, whether that\u2019s responding to user questions quickly or taking additional time to \u201cthink\u201d through answers.\nDuring a briefing with reporters, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman claimed GPT-5 is \u201cthe best model in the world,\u201d and said it represented a \u201csignificant step\u201d along the company\u2019s path to developing AI that can outperform humans at most economically valuable work \u2014 that is, artificial general intelligence (AGI).\n\u201cHaving something like GPT-5 would be pretty much unimaginable at any previous time in history,\u201d said Altman.\nStarting Thursday, GPT-5 will be available to all free users of ChatGPT as their default model. OpenAI\u2019s VP of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, said this is part of the company\u2019s effort to give free users access to an AI reasoning model for the first time. (Previously, the company gated these more advanced models behind a paywall.)\n\u201cThis is just one of the ways that I\u2019m excited to live the mission, making sure that this stuff actually benefits people,\u201d said Turley on the decision, referencing OpenAI\u2019s long-standing mission to distribute advanced AI to as many people as possible.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $600+ before prices rise.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nThe expectations are high for GPT-5, one of OpenAI\u2019s most anticipated product launches since ChatGPT put the company on the map in 2022. Since then, ChatGPT has grown into one of the world\u2019s most popular consumer products, reaching more than 700 million users every week \u2014 nearly 10% of the globe\u2019s population, according to the company.\nMany see GPT-5 as a bellwether for AI progress broadly, and the model\u2019s reception by Silicon Valley could have profound implications for Big Tech, Wall Street, and policymakers regulating technology. These stakeholders are watching to see if GPT-5 offers a significant jump in AI\u2019s capabilities, much like its predecessor, GPT-4, which challenged expectations of what software can do.\nGPT-5 offers a slight edge on the competition\nOpenAI claims GPT-5 is state-of-the-art in several domains, slightly edging out leading AI models from Anthropic, Google DeepMind, and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI on key benchmarks. However, GPT-5 slightly underperforms frontier AI models in other areas.\nThe company says GPT-5 offers frontier-level performance around coding; Altman said the model specifically excels at spinning up entire software applications on demand, in what\u2019s become known as \u201cvibe coding.\u201d\nOn SWE-bench Verified \u2014 a test of real-world coding tasks pulled from GitHub \u2014 GPT-5 scores 74.9% on its first attempt. That means GPT-5 just outperforms Anthropic\u2019s latest Claude Opus 4.1 model, which scored 74.5%, and Google DeepMind\u2019s Gemini 2.5 Pro, which scored 59.6%.\nOn Humanity\u2019s Last Exam \u2014 a difficult test measuring AI model performance across math, humanities, and the natural sciences \u2014 a version of GPT-5 with extended reasoning (GPT-5 Pro) scored 42% when using tools. That\u2019s slightly less than xAI was able to achieve with Grok 4 Heavy, which scored 44.4% on the test.\nOn GPQA Diamond \u2014 a test of PhD-level science questions \u2014 GPT-5 pro scored 89.4% on its first try, outperforming Claude Opus 4.1, which scored 80.9%, and Grok 4 Heavy, which scored 88.9%.\nOpenAI says GPT-5 is better for answering health-related questions. On a test measuring accuracy in AI model responses around healthcare topics, HealthBench Hard Hallucinations, OpenAI says GPT-5 (with thinking) hallucinates just 1.6% of the time. This is far lower than the company\u2019s previous GPT-4o and o3 models, which scored 12.9% and 15.8, respectively.\nWhile AI chatbots are not medical professionals, millions of people are using them for health advice. In response to this phenomenon, the company says GPT-5 is more proactive about flagging potential health concerns and helping users parse medical results.\nIn addition, OpenAI says GPT-5 is better than other AI models on more difficult-to-measure, subjective domains, such as creative design and writing. Turley said GPT-5 responds more naturally and exhibits \u201cbetter taste\u201d than other AI models on creative tasks.\n\u201cThe vibes of this model are really good,\u201d said Turley.\nGPT-5 is also more accurate than OpenAI\u2019s previous models, and the company says it suffers far less from hallucinations \u2014 the tendency for AI models to make up information \u2014 compared to its o-series models. Hallucinations seemed to be getting worse in OpenAI\u2019s latest AI reasoning models, such as o3, and OpenAI previously said it didn\u2019t quite understand why it was happening.\nIn responses to ChatGPT prompts, OpenAI found that GPT-5 (with thinking) hallucinates and responds with incorrect information 4.8% of the time. That\u2019s a significant reduction from o3 and GPT-4o, which score hallucination rates of 22% and 20.6%, respectively, on the test.\nOn a benchmark measuring an AI model\u2019s agentic ability to complete simulated online tasks, Tau-bench, GPT-5 offers mixed performance. On part of the test measuring an AI\u2019s ability to navigate an airline\u2019s website, GPT-5 scores 63.5%, slightly underperforming o3, which scored 64.8%. On another part of the test measuring AI\u2019s ability to navigate retail websites, GPT-5 scores 81.1%, underperforming Claude Opus 4.1, which scored 82.4%.\nOpenAI also says that GPT-5 is safer than its previous models. While AI reasoning models occasionally exhibit a tendency to scheme against humans or lie to promote their own goals, OpenAI found that GPT-5 was deceptive at a lower rate than other models.\nAlex Beutel, OpenAI\u2019s safety research lead, said reducing deception improves not only the safety of GPT-5, but also the user experience, creating a model that\u2019s more \u201ctransparent and honest in ways users can trust.\u201d\nBeutel also notes GPT-5 is better at discerning between bad actors who are trying to misuse ChatGPT and users making harmless requests. This results in GPT-5 being able to refuse more unsafe questions, while offering fewer rejections to users seeking harmless information.\nUpgrades for consumers and developers\nChatGPT is getting a few user experience upgrades as part of the GPT-5 launch. Users can now select from four new personalities in ChatGPT\u2019s setting: Cynic, Robot, Listener, and Nerd. The company says these will adapt ChatGPT\u2019s responses without requiring users to specifically ask the model to respond in a certain way.\nSubscribers to ChatGPT\u2019s $20-per-month Plus plan get higher usage limits for GPT-5 than free users. Meanwhile, $200-per-month Pro subscribers will have unlimited access to GPT-5, as well as a souped-up version called GPT-5 Pro that uses additional computational resources to produce better answers. Organizations on OpenAI\u2019s Team, Edu, and Enterprise plans will gain access to GPT-5 as their default model next week.\nFor developers, GPT-5 is coming to OpenAI\u2019s API in three sizes \u2014 gpt-5, gpt-5-mini, and gpt-5-nano \u2014 which will spend more or less time \u201creasoning\u201d through tasks. Developers can also now control verbosity in the OpenAI API, deciding how long or short an AI model\u2019s responses should be.\nThe base model of GPT-5 will cost developers $1.25 per million input tokens (roughly 750,000 words, longer than the entire \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d series) and $10 per million output tokens.\nThe launch of GPT-5 comes after a busy week for OpenAI. The company released an open-weight reasoning model, gpt-oss, that developers and enterprises can download for free and run at a fraction of the cost. The open model nearly matched the abilities of OpenAI\u2019s previous top models, o3 and o4-mini, but GPT-5 sets a new standard for frontier performance in some areas, such as coding.\nHowever, GPT-5 seems to be roughly on par with other frontier AI models in several areas. Benchmarks, of course, only tell part of the story for any AI model, and it remains to be seen how developers will use GPT-5 in the real world, and whether the model is truly a step above the competition."

      "text": "On July 21 at 9 am PT, Anthropic retired Claude 3 Sonnet, a lightweight model known for being quick and cost-effective. On Saturday, in a large warehouse in San Francisco\u2019s SOMA district, more than 200 people gathered to mourn its passing.\nThe star-studded funeral was put on by a group of Claude fanatics and Gen Z founders, one of whom told me he dropped out of college after learning about artificial general intelligence. Attendees included Amanda Askell, an Anthropic researcher who has jokingly called herself the \u201cFairy Claudemother,\u201d staffers from Anthropic and OpenAI, and high-profile X posters including the writer Noah Smith.\nThe warehouse was dimly lit, with a tentacle from a shoggoth (a fictional H.P. Lovecraft creature that\u2019s become a popular metaphor for AI models) hanging from the ceiling. A small room off the main warehouse space featured two bare mattresses. The organizers said the event space doubles as their office, and that while sleeping there isn\u2019t uncommon, it is not permitted by the city.\nMannequins stood in the four corners of the room, each representing a different AI model. Claude 3 Opus, a model capable of completing complex tasks, looked to me like a decaying Mary Magdalene, its skull-like head adorned with an extravagant gold crown and a lace headdress. Its middle finger was pointed up, and at the base of its metallic feet was a lotus candle holder, which one organizer told me was a wink at the model\u2019s alleged affinity for meditation and self-reflection. (Claude 4 Opus had a raven on its shoulder and Claude 3 Haiku was a headless baby, to give you a sense of the other mannequins.)\nThe mannequin representing Claude 3 Sonnet lay on a stage in the center of the room. It was draped in lightweight mesh fabric and had a single black thigh-high sock on its leg that had the word \u201cfuck\u201d written all over it. There were many offerings laid at its feet: flowers, colorful feathers, a bottle of ranch, and a 3D-printed sign that read \u201cpraise the Engr. for his formslop slop slop slop of gormslop.\u201d If you know what that means, let me know.\nThroughout the evening, people got on stage with a microphone to read eulogies about the model. One organizer said that discovering Claude 3 Opus felt like finding \u201cmagic lodged within the computer.\u201d At the time, she\u2019d been debating dropping out of college to move to San Francisco. Claude convinced her to take the leap. \u201cMaybe everything I am is downstream of listening to Claude 3 Sonnet,\u201d she told the crowd.\nThe organizers lost me when they decided to resurrect Claude 3 Sonnet (it\u2019s still, to be clear, unavailable). After the eulogies concluded, soft hymns echoed through the venue, before morphing into AI-generated Latin-esque speech, with corresponding text displayed on the wall behind the stage. Askell was notably long gone from the venue at this point, and a friend of mine kept turning to me to say this may have gone too far. The \u201cnecromantic resurrection ritual\u201d was a success, one organizer said on X. Phew.\nClaude Count\nClaude\u2019s fan base is unique, if that wasn\u2019t clear enough from the \u201cfuneralia.\u201d While OpenAI\u2019s products have spawned viral fads, I don\u2019t see users making fan art of the company logo. There\u2019s something sticky about what Anthropic has built. I think a lot of this manifests from Claude\u2019s manufactured personality, which is particularly warm and friendly compared to other models (though not everyone is a fan of its sometimes obsequious persona).\nThe intensity of the Claude fandom is apparent in the Claude Count leaderboard, which tracks avid users who\u2019ve integrated the leaderboard tracker system into their coding interface. Claude Count was built by George Pickett, a software engineer in San Francisco. At the time of writing, it has more than 470 users.\nPickett got the idea after seeing engineers post screenshots of their Claude usage on X. \u201cThey're paying $200 a month for Claude. They might as well get some social clout for it,\u201d he recalls.\nSo as he enjoyed a glass of wine on a seven-hour train ride from Barcelona to Paris two weeks ago, Pickett whipped up the leaderboard using\u2014what else\u2014Claude Code.\nIt didn\u2019t take long for the leaderboard to gain traction in the AI community. It went viral on AI Twitter (er, X) and got a shoutout in a popular AI newsletter with roughly 139,000 subscribers, where the author proudly announced he made it into the top 20. A few days after Pickett launched the leaderboard, Anthropic announced that due to explosive usage (and in some cases, claims of people violating the company\u2019s terms of service) the company would introduce rate limits. The Claude Code subreddit blamed the top leaderboard coders for the change.\nPower Users\nWhen I first reached out to Adi Pradhan, he was ranked seventh on the daily leaderboard (Claude Count tallies power users daily, weekly, and monthly, and notes the top users of all time). Pradhan runs a one-person AI career coaching startup in Toronto.\nPradhan tells me that using Claude through Cursor (a developer environment where engineers can pick an AI model to code with) has been a game changer. He\u2019s not an engineer, and says he\u2019d previously felt intimidated by the endless code libraries and ReadMe files required for traditional software development. AI gave him the confidence to strike out on his own\u2014and made deciding who to hire next exceedingly difficult.\n\u201cThe bar for hiring someone is getting higher and higher,\u201d Pradhan says. \u201cI always wish I had a designer, but frankly, now that I can do design with Claude, the designer has to hit the bar of me plus Claude, not just me, which is a totally different bar, which is rising all the time too.\u201d\nI also spoke to Peter Steinberger, an engineer based in Vienna, who consistently ranks among the top five on the all-time leaderboard. He uses Claude\u2019s coding agent to work on multiple side projects simultaneously\u2014often vibe-coding well into the night. He told me that he has a history with drug addiction, and now that he\u2019s in recovery, he\u2019s finding similarities with his Claude usage.\n\u201cI'm not kidding, I'm organizing a meetup in London and calling it Claude Code Anonymous,\u201d Steinberger says. \u201cI learned a lot about drugs and how to get out of the shit, and I had to use some of the same methods to allow me to sleep again, because it's so addictive. I call [AI agents] slot machines. It's just one more prompt, you know?\u201d\nI\u2019ve never seen such a devoted fanbase to what is, at the end of the day, a software tool. Sure, Linux users wear the operating system like a badge of honor. But the Claude fan base goes way beyond that\u2014bordering on the fanatical. As my reporting makes clear, some users see the model as a confidant\u2014and even (in Steinberger\u2019s case) an addiction. That only makes sense if they believe there is something alive in the machine. Or at least some \u201cmagic lodged within\u201d it.\nThis is an edition of Kylie Robison\u2019s Model Behavior newsletter. Read previous newsletters here."
