      "feedback": "The draft captures the cloud/AI backdrop and cash‑flow moat well, but the causal chain from cloud spend to S&P earnings/multiples is underdefined, the piece lacks a formal, first‑principles transmission framework, and it reads as a narrative rather than a testable scenario analysis; it also trails on catalysts without explicit thresholds and provides limited quantified sensitivities, making it hard to gauge risk/price impact. Actionable edits: (1) Rebuild the transmission into three crisp layers and connect them with explicit elasticities or rules‑of‑thumb, e.g., Macro/Policy regime (rates, terms of trade, external balance) → Productivity/Cloud investment (use 21.2% YoY cloud spend growth to $2.4T by 2030; Azure +39%; Shopify +31%) → Cash‑flow/Margins and Valuation (1.8–2.2% yields; 33.6% payout; 12–18% justness premium), with every link anchored to the cited IDs (0G3A)(TN66GHPAT)(4LQD15CFU). (2) Add a formal base/alternative scenario with explicit horizons (base, bull, bear) and quantified bands for key inputs (cloud spend growth, oil impulse, tariff duration) so you can map to outcomes for earnings, FCF, and P/E. (3) Catalog 3–4 catalysts/triggers with clear invalidation points and thresholds (e.g., tariff extension beyond ~120 days; cloud spend growth decelerating below mid‑teens YoY; IEA oil supply surprise ±2–3 mbpd; wage/inflation surprise prompting policy shift) and tie each to the sources (RHXDOHQQX; J99EM2TPZ; 0G3A; TN66GHPAT; 4LQD15CFU). (4) Quantify sensitivities: substitute narrative statements with numbers, e.g., if cloud spend grows +x% vs base, estimate ΔCF and ΔP/E using a simple CF/discount-rate framework; keep this to a few lines and cite sources. (5) Reconcile conflicts explicitly (oversupply in oil is deflationary but policy risk remains; tariff truce reduces near‑term risk premia) and spell out how you would weight each in a downside vs upside scenario. (6) Build a compact watch-list of 6 decisive signals with lead times and data sources, and ensure every claim has a citation; remove repetitions and tighten phrasing to satisfy SECTION FOCUS; (7) verify all citations map to IDs in the SOURCE MATERIAL and avoid introducing non‑listed terms, keeping the final output tightly aligned to the 0G3A, 4LQD15CFU, TN66GHPAT, J99EM2TPZ, and RHXDOHQQX set.",
