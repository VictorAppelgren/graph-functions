  "title": "Top Prospect Jett Williams\u2019 Career Taking Off Towards New York Mets",
  "description": "New York Mets fans, annoyed for decades by jet planes flying over their home ballpark, ironically cannot wait for top prospect Jett Williams to land there.",
  "content": "New York Mets fans, annoyed for decades by jet planes flying over their home ballpark, ironically cannot wait for Jett Williams to land there.\n\nWilliams, 21, can play shortstop, second base and center field and has exciting offensive skills. All that would be much more welcome than the screeching of jets taking off or landing at nearby LaGuardia Airport.\n\nThe tiny Texan is no Jumbo Jet, standing only 5-foot-7 and weighing 175 pounds. But he puts surprising flight into a pitched baseball with a quick, right-handed swing. He\u2019s currently hitting .282 with 10 homers, 67 runs and 29 stolen bases this year for the Binghamton Rumble Ponies of the Class AA Eastern League.\n\nThe Mets organization thought that when they made Williams the 14th overall choice in the 2022 MLB Draft and gave him a $3.9 million signing bonus. Three shortstops chosen ahead of him are regulars in MLB ball. Jackson Holliday, the No. 1 pick, is the Baltimore Orioles\u2019 second baseman, No. 8 Brooks Lee plays short, third and second for the Minnesota Twins and No. 13 Zach Neto has already played 335 MLB games as the Los Angeles Angels\u2019 shortstop.\n\nWilliams is best suited for short, but with all-star Francisco Lindor still having five years left on his 10-year, $341 million contract, this Jett likely will be diverted elsewhere.\n\nIn 15 games this season at second base, Williams has made only one error in 60 chances with a 3.96 range factor. Though only a tiny sample size, that mark compares close to career rates at second for Gleyber Torres (3.92) of the New York Yankees and Brandon Lowe (3.98) of the Tampa Bay Rays. Jose Altuve, the 5-foot-6 star of the Houston Astros, has a career range factor of 4.00.\n\nWilliams\u2019 first full season in the minors was successful as he had 45 stolen bases and drew a whopping 104 walks at age 19 across three lower levels. Overall, he hit .263 with 13 homers, 22 doubles, 81 runs and 55 RBI in 121 games.\n\nThe Jett was grounded much of 2024 with a bad wing \u2013 specifically a right wrist injury that needed surgery and sidelined him a couple months. He hit only .215 with no homers in 33 games. He went to the Arizona Fall League and hit .225 in 22 games, swiping seven bases in eight tries.\n\nHe was hit in the hand by a pitch during spring training this past February but missed little time. In June, he was hit in the helmet by a pitch. He left the game and was back in the lineup two days later \u2013 going 2-for-4 with two RBI and a walk. That started him on an 11-game streak in which he batted .383 (18 for 47).\n\nNot all good ballplayers are as tall as sluggers Aaron Judge, Mark McGwire or Frank Howard. Guys shorter than Williams have done quite well, such as Hall of Famers Willie Keeler, Rabbit Maranville, Billy Hamilton, Hack Wilson, Phil Rizzuto and Joe Morgan.\n\nAll of them except the 5-6 Wilson had similar skills. Wilson was built like a fire hydrant at 190 pounds and produced huge power. He was not fast and a poor fielder.\n\nOver a five-year span, 1926-30, for the Chicago Cubs, he averaged 35 homers, 142 RBI and .331 with a 1.031 OPS. At age 30, he had a season for the ages in 1930, driving in a MLB-record 191 runs with 56 homers with 146 runs and a .356 average.\n\nThe other five all hit and fielded well with speed to burn. Hamilton batted .344 with 914 stolen bases; Keeler hit .341 with 495 steals; Morgan had 689 steals and more homers than Wilson at 268. Rizzuto and Maranville were exceptional fielding shortstops and fine leadoff batters.\n\nAltuve appears headed for enshrinement in Cooperstown at age 35 with 640 steals, 248 homers, three batting titles and a .305 career average.\n\nHe has the skills to succeed. Where those skills best fit into the Mets\u2019 lineup is the big question. For now, he is assuredly blocked at shortstop by Lindor. Former center fielder Brandon Nimmo, moved to left, still has five years left on his eight-year, $162 million contract. He moved over this year with Tyrone Taylor playing center.\n\nTaylor has hit only .200 with 19 RBI in 100 games. He\u2019s a .234 career hitter. The Mets brought in Cedric Mullins from the Baltimore Orioles at the trading deadline. He\u2019s age 30, a free agent at the end of the season, and still a tremendous defensive player.\n\nUnless Mullins regains a semblance of the form he had in 2021 when he hit .291 with 30 homers and 30 steals, the Mets probably won\u2019t make him an offer to return.\n\nThat means there should be an opening in center. Williams could be in a spring-training battle for the role with natural center fielder Carson Benge. He is No.4 on MLB Pipeline\u2019s list of Mets prospects and hitting .336 as Williams\u2019 teammate at Binghamton at age 22. Benge, Williams and pitcher Jonah Tong have helped the Rumble Ponies to a 70-33 record this year.\n\nVeteran Jeff McNeil and young Luisangel Acuna have shared second-base duties in New York. McNeil, 33, has battled injuries. The two-time all-star signed a four-year, $50 million contract before the 2023 season after he won the 2022 NL batting title at .326.\n\nAcuna, younger brother of Atlanta Braves star outfielder Ronald Acuna, has played good defense at second. The 23-year-old is 12-for-13 in steal attempts but has no homers and only 7 RBI in 175 at-bats. In 520 games in the minors, he hit .281 with 41 homers and was forecast to grow into an MLB star. It has yet to happen.\n\nWilliams has similar skills. Scouts believe he could develop some more power; remember, they forecast that for Acuna, too. That\u2019s Luisangel, not slugger Ronald.\n\nThe best way for Williams to find a home with the New York Mets is to build one himself. If he continues to develop, he will force the issue. He will likely get a chance to challenge for a job next spring. It\u2019s up to him to clear the runway.",

      "text": "Jonah Tong looks more like a perfect first-round pick these days instead of a seventh-round choice signed for $226,000 by the New York Mets.\nThat\u2019s what the the Canadian right-hander got to sign after being the 13th choice of the seventh round, No. 209 overall, in the 2022 MLB Draft. That gave him 226,000 reasons to forget his college commitment to North Dakota State and turn pro.\nTong\u2019s motion remarkably resembles that of two-time National League Cy Young Award winner Tim Lincecum. His performance this year for the Binghamton Rumble Ponies of the Double-A Eastern League mimics Lincecum\u2019s results early in his 10-year career after being the 10th overall choice in the 2006 Draft by the San Francisco Giants.\nTong\u2019s 72 strikeouts lead the EL. They have come in only 44 innings. And 13 were in a perfect 6 2/3 innings on May 10. He threw 99 pitches in setting down all 20 Reading batters he faced in a seven-inning game 2 of a doubleheader. Roommate T.J. Shook fanned the final batter for the first perfect game in franchise history and first in full-season affiliate baseball since Sept. 1, 2017.\nTong threw 61 pitches for strikes with 18 swing-and-miss efforts.\n\u201cMan, it was very difficult (to pull him),\u201d manager Reid Brignac told The Athletic. \u201cIt was very, very difficult. We had a plan set for him for the day based off his last outing and his pitch counts. This is the minor leagues, it\u2019s about development and giving him the opportunity to pitch in the big leagues.\u201d\nTong extended his scoreless streak seven days later by blanking the Hartford Yard Goats on two hits and two walks over six innings, fanning eight.\nIn nine starts overall, he has a 3-3 record, 2.25 ERA and allowed 23 hits and 24 walks.\nThat follows a fine 2024 season across three levels from Low-A St. Lucie to Binghamton when he went 6-4 with a 3.03 ERA in 25 outings. His 160 strikeouts were the most by a Mets farmhand and his 34.2% whiff rate ranked fifth among all Minor League qualifiers.\nScouting Jonah Tong\nAt 6-foot-1, 180 pounds, the 21-year-old is built similarly to the 5-11, 170-pound Lincecum. His over-the-top motion is smoother than Lincecum\u2019s violent delivery but sets up a fastball-curve mix the same way.\nTong\u2019s fastball has improved since signing but is nowhere near Linceum\u2019s upper-90s heater. Tong\u2019s average fastball velocity is in the 91-94 mph range yet the pitch shows remarkable life up in the zone.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really understand how it does its thing, but I just know it\u2019s always been my go-to and I just have a lot of conviction trust behind it,\u201d Tong told Brendan Samson of MLB.com following his perfect outing.\nThat sets up his second-best pitch, a 74-76 mph curveball that he can drop from eye level to the ankles in a flash.\nTong also throws an 82-84 mph slider that needs work and a changeup which gets some strikeouts with movement. He does not command either that well, contributing to a rather high 4.7 walks per nine innings as a pro, including 4.9 this season.\nSome scouts believe that more experienced hitters will lay off the fastball, ignore any curve dipping out of the zone, and eventually hammer one of the lesser offerings.\nKeeping Up With The Tongs\nJonah comes from an athletic family. His mother Karen and father Alex played multiple sports in high school She played softball, field hockey, and volleyball; he played hockey and volleyball. They met while playing adult league slow pitch and volleyball.\nTong\u2019s sister Morgan was a gymnast at Central Michigan, voted Mid-American Conference freshman of the year, First Team all MAC beam team (second year), MAC beam champion 2021, qualified to NCAA Nationals to beam as an individual (2021), CMU won the regular season and conference tournament\nHis other sister Montana played softball growing up and for her varsity baseball team in high school.\nVideo Helped The Young Pitching Star\nThe very first music video shown on MTV on Aug. 1, 1981 was \u201cVideo Killed The Radio Star\u201d by the Buggles. Born 22 years later, Tong says video helped this young pitching star.\n\u201cI watched a lot of guys growing up,\u201d he said. \u201cMy dad did, too, and would say, hey watch Greg Maddux. He\u2019s the ultimate pitcher who combines athletic talent with brains.\u201d\nTong lists Lincecum among players that have had a video influence on his career along with Los Angeles Dodgers great Clayton Kershaw, former Met and current Texas Rangers ace Jacob DeGrom, current Dodger Tyler Glasnow and the Hall of Famer Maddux. There\u2019s a hint of Hall of Famer Roy Halladay in Tong\u2019s mechanics, too. As a young boy, he watched the late right-hander excel with the Toronto Blue Jays and Philadelphia Phillies.\nHis favorite pitcher was the first he ever actually saw. That was former Toronto right-hander Brett Cecil at a meet-and-greet session the Blue Jays had for young players in the area. Tong grew up about 20 miles northeast of the Rogers Centre in Markham, Ontario.\nJonah Tong\u2019s Future\nMLB Pipeline ranks Tong as the Mets\u2019 fourth overall prospect behind speedy shortstop-outfielder Jett Williams, right-hander Brandon Sproat and outfielder Carson Benge. ESPN ranks him ahead of Sproat and Baseball America ranks his fastball as best in the Mets\u2019 farm system.\nObviously, the future is bright. The only clouds on the horizon come from Tong\u2019s lack of consistent command and the need to develop a reliable third and possibly fourth pitch.\nAn expanded arsenal and the ability to throw strikes with all pitches makes him a viable rotation candidate. If not, the elite fastball-curve mix could play well out of the bullpen.\nThe Mets, as shown in pulling him with a perfect game in the balance, will proceed carefully with Jonah Tong. He\u2019s not exactly built to be an innings-eating ace. Then again, neither was 5-11, 170-pound Pedro Martinez who made two all-star teams for the Mets in an 18-year Hall of Fame career with five teams.\nYou never can tell. Look what happened with Martinez, signed for only $6,500 by the Los Angeles Dodgers as an amateur in 1988. The New York Mets and Jonah Tong will gladly take such a career."

      "text": "Ronald Acuna Jr. not only is the likely leader to be 2023 National League MVP, he spearheads the cheers for younger brother Luisangel.\nThe younger Acuna was acquired in a ballyhooed trade by the New York Mets from the Texas Rangers for star pitcher Max Scherzer. Reports on the precocious prospect are glowing, particularly those by the Atlanta Braves\u2019 outfielder.\n\u201cMy brother is more advanced and better than I was at his age. Maybe I was as talented, but not as advanced,\u201d Ronald told the Dallas Morning News through an interpreter.\nNice thoughts, though understandably a bit hyperbolized.\nLuisangel is just 21 years old. The shortstop went 0-for-4 in his debut for the Mets\u2019 Class AA farm team at Binghamton (N.Y.) after the deal. Before that, he hit .315 with 7 home runs, 51 RBI, 68 runs and 42 stolen bases in 47 attempts at the same level in 84 games for Frisco (Tx.) in the Rangers system this year.\nAt the same age, Ronald was already an established star in Atlanta. At age 20 in 2018, he hit .293 with 26 homers, 78 runs, 64 RBI and 16 steals in 111 games to win the NL Rookie of the Year Award. At age 21, he finished fifth in MVP voting after leading the NL in runs (127) and steals (37) while batting .280 with 41 homers and 101 RBI. He\u2019s on pace to obliterate those numbers at age 25, already amassing 51 steals, 24 homers, 93 runs, 61 RBI and a .331 average with 57 games to play in 2023.\nLittle brother does claim one family record. He received a signing bonus of $425,000 from the Rangers in 2018, four years after Ronald signed for $100,000.\nWhether Luisangel, at 5-foot-8, 181 pounds, develops power similar to his 6-foot, 205-pound big brother will be seen. Ronald hit 30 minor-league homers. Luisangel currently has 32 in 83 more games. With 142 steals in 174 attempts (.822), he does appear faster. Ronald pilfered 82 bags in 114 minor-league tries (.719).\nWith Francisco Lindor signed to a 10-year, $341 million contract through 2031, the Mets may move Luisangel from shortstop. He has played 82 games in the minors at second base. His speed could excel in center field.\nFamily Matters\nThe Acunas are quite an All In The Family story. Long-time shortstop Alcides Escobar and pitcher Kelvim Escobar along with lesser-known Vicente Campos and Edwin Escobar are all cousins who played in the majors.\nWhen Luisangel gets called up, as expected by Mets executives and fans, he will add to the 439 sets of brothers to make The Show. Usually, the eldest is most successful. Tommie Aaron, Rich Murray and Billy Ripken never approached the careers of older brothers and Baseball Hall of Famers Hank, Eddie and Cal, respectively.\nOnly one brace of brothers are in the Hall as players. Outfielders Paul (Big Poison) and Lloyd (Little Poison) Waner were Pittsburgh Pirates teammates from 1927 through 1940. Paul, older by three years, was significantly better with 113 homers, 1,627 runs, 1,308 RBI and a .333 career average for four teams over 20 seasons. Lloyd wasn\u2019t too shabby for 18 years and five ballclubs. He batted .316 with 1,201 runs but only 27 homers and 598 RBI.\nSometimes, baby brother becomes better. Hall of Famers Roberto Alomar, Vladimir Guerrero, Heinie Manush, Honus Wagner and Robin Yount not only followed in the footsteps of older brothers Sandy, Wilton, Frank, Albert and Larry, respectively, but made bigger footprints upon the game.\nThere have been 13 sets of three big-league brothers. Most recently, we saw Yadier, Bengie and Jose Molina, all catchers. In the 1960s, Felipe, Matty and Jesus Alou all played in the same outfield for the San Francisco Giants, while the famous family of the 40s was the DiMaggios: Vince, Dominic and legendary Hall of Famer Joe.\nSteve, Mike, Jim and Jack O\u2019Neill were a family four-bagger in the early 1900s. Steve played 17 years and managed for 14 more, guiding the 1945 Detroit Tigers to a World Series win over the Chicago Cubs.\n1, 2, 3, 4 ... 5?\nThe Delahantys were five big-league baseball brothers, all born in Cleveland. Hall of Famer Ed was the oldest, a hard-playing, harder-drinking outfielder who compiled a .346 average with a whopping (for the era) 101 homers over 16 seasons, mostly in Philadelphia, the \u201cCity of Brotherly Love\u201d between 1888 and 1903. Jim, Frank, Joe and Tom had varying degrees of success in that descending order.\nEd died at age 35 after being put off a train due to misconduct. Here\u2019s John Saccoman\u2019s fine account of Ed Delahanty\u2019s career and demise:\nAll of these men gained fame as hitters. Hall of Fame pitchers who are one half of MLB sibling duos are: Stan Coveleski, Dizzy Dean, Tom Glavine, Greg Maddux, Gaylord Perry, Trevor Hoffman, Phil Niekro and Christy Mathewson.\nThe Mathewsons had the biggest career disparity. Christy had 373 wins and incredible 2.13 ERA in 636 games, all but one for the New York Giants between 1900 and 1916. Henry went 0-1 with a 4.91 ERA in three games for the Giants in 1906-07.\nThe Acunas, even with Ronald\u2019s current stratospheric pace and Luisangel\u2019s hype, likely will land somewhere in between."
