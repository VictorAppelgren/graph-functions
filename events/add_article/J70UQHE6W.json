      "summary": "The Tianjin Show marked a significant convergence of the SCO and BRICS, with Xi Jinping outlining a new global governance framework that emphasizes sovereign equality, multilateralism, and a people‑centered approach. The summit highlighted the launch of a SCO Development Bank to mirror the BRICS New Development Bank and the AIIB, aiming to reduce dependence on Western financial structures and counter sanctions. Leaders such as Putin and Modi underscored the role of the SCO as a vehicle for genuine multilateralism and a pan‑Eurasian security model, while China’s initiatives seek to integrate infrastructure, AI, and trade across the Eurasian region. The event signals a shift toward a multipolar world order, challenging the existing Western‑led institutions and promoting deeper economic cooperation among the Global Majority.",
