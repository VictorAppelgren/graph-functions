  "title": "Dua Lipa\u2019s Latest Frilly Bikini Made A Strong Case For Boho Chic At The Beach",
  "description": "While on vacation, Dua Lipa wore a frilly bikini from Chlo\u00e9, the It girl fave boho-chic label.",
  "content": "Back in the early 2000s, Chlo\u00e9 was the ultimate It girl brand, constantly repped by boho\u2019s biggest advocates. Think: Kate Moss, Sienna Miller, and the Olsen Twins. Even Beyonc\u00e9, Lindsay Lohan, and Kim Kardashian weren\u2019t immune to the French label\u2019s appeal and were often spotted carrying its handbags, including the Paddington and the Bracelet.\n\nThough the fervor for the boho chic aesthetic as a whole waned in the decade that followed, the brand\u2019s recent appointment of Chemena Kamali as its new creative director in October 2023 revived the style. These days, seemingly every current It girl has been flocking to Chlo\u00e9\u2019s ruffly, free-spirited aesthetic. One such style star is Dua Lipa.\n\nBetween carrying the brand\u2019s most popular bags and its frilly clothes, the \u201cHoudini\u201d songstress has been rocking the brand and its trademark vibe. She did the exact same thing over the weekend, bringing the boho chic look to one of her beachy travels.\n\nOn main, Lipa shared photos from an undisclosed getaway, wearing ultra-frilly resortwear. On top, she wore a crop top held together by a meager string. The sleeved item featured an empire cut with a ruffled hem and neckline, all with saccharine eyelet embroidery throughout. The sheer fabrication also gave a peek into her dotted triangle bikini top underneath.\n\nShe paired the look with a second frilly item. Instead of her usual go-to thong, she went the coquette route and donned white textured bikini bottoms with more coverage. It featured a tiny flounced trim and the Chlo\u00e9 logo in a gold font.\n\nHer accessories were supporting actors in the same boho narrative. She wore several layers of long pendant necklaces \u2014 a 2010s favorite making a comeback \u2014 including one with a precious stone and another with mermaidcore-esque shells.\n\nFor extra oomph, she stacked even more bling including a black bangle, chunky gilded rings, and hoop earrings with an aquamarine stone.\n\nElsewhere in the photo dump, the \u201cNew Rules\u201d singer wore a coverup also squarely in the boho realm. Her choice was a teeny miniskirt with delicate floral embroidery, similar to sheer table napkins grandmas would have in their homes. She pulled them so low on her hips to expose her bikini\u2019s logo.",

      "text": "Celebrity Style\nDaisy Edgar-Jones Proved She\u2019s A Style Star In 2 Must-See Dresses\nBack-to-back slays.\nDaisy Edgar-Jones is easily a rising Hollywood star \u2014 just take a peek at her IMDb reel. But entertainment isn\u2019t the only realm she\u2019s conquering. She\u2019s also a fashion icon in the making.\nWhile on her Twisters press tour, the actor has been consistently proving her high-fashion caliber, showing out in Gucci, Givenchy, and Elie Saab, among others. She\u2019s also begun to carve her style DNA: elegant meets daring. She can wear the boldest of dresses with utter sophistication.\nOn Thursday, July 18, the Normal People alum stepped out in not one but four different outfits. While all of them were undeniably stylish, two, in particular, flaunted her sartorial range.\nDaisy\u2019s Heart-Shaped Dress\nDaisy\u2019s first dress \u2014 an ecru mini with an asymmetrical hemline \u2014 was a structured dream. While the neutral hue was low-key, her bodice was practically a work of art. Designed by Victoria Beckham, the strapless neckline was an exaggerated heart shape bordered with a chunky, puffy trim.\nLeaning into a monochromatic vibe, she paired the look with lace-up sandals in the same neutral tone and accessorized with black sunglasses and hoop earrings.\nThe Internet Had ~Thoughts~\nIt\u2019s only been 24 hours since Edgar-Jones debuted the look and, already, the internet can\u2019t stop talking about it.\nWhile some have utterly embraced the number, some Instagram users and Redditors have playfully dubbed it the \u201cmouse ears\u201d dress, comparing the neckline to the rodent\u2019s teeny body parts. One Redditor even pointed out how it looked like the mouse ears Karen Smith (played by Amanda Seyfried) wore in Mean Girls.\nShe Wore A Sheer Whimsical Dream\nAfter her sculptural wardrobe choice, Edgar-Jones made a sartorial U-turn in a frilly, ethereal dress. Ruffles, tiers, billowing sleeves \u2014 the Chlo\u00e9 ensemble had it all.\nThanks to its sheer fabric, the dress showed off her bra, a style M.O. the actor is fond of. If that weren\u2019t risqu\u00e9 enough, it also featured a massive tummy cut-out.\nShe accessorized the look with knee-high mustard boots and a statement pendant necklace.\nThe Ensemble Could\u2019ve Been An Homage To Taylor Swift\nIf her gray number was mouse-coded, this blue confection was reminiscent of Taylor Swift. In the Eras Tour\u2019s Folklore era, the \u201cSo Long, London\u201d singer wears a similar frilly dress.\nLike the actor\u2019s attire, Swift\u2019s drapery is a frilly, semi-sheer masterpiece with a midriff cut-out. The Grammy winner\u2019s, however, differs in sleeves and her leafy embroidery. Also, Swift\u2019s Folklore costume is typically maroon or swampy green.\nSo while Edgar-Jones\u2019 number is similar in style to the singer\u2019s eighth studio album, the pale blue color of her dress was 1989-coded (i.e. Swift\u2019s fifth album is often associated with the hue). Whether the look was a planned homage is unclear, but it\u2019s possible. After all, Edgar-Jones is a known Swiftie.\nAfter Swift wrote the original song \u201cCarolina\u201d for Edgar-Jones\u2019 2022 film Where the Crawdads Sing, the actor told Elle UK, \u201cIf I\u2019d told my younger self that Taylor Swift would do a song for something I\u2019m in... bonkers.\u201d"

Dispute Resolution: Binding Arbitration Clause and Class Waiver.\nPLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS\u2014INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT (BY REQUIRING YOUR DISPUTE TO BE SUBMITTED TO ARBITRATION) AND LIMITING YOUR RIGHTS TO RESOLVE YOUR DISPUTE AS PART OF A CLASS.\nAs detailed herein, the Terms of Service mandate that all disputes between you and BDG be resolved first through an informal dispute resolution process. In the event informal resolution fails, the Terms of Service further mandate that all disputes (except those identified in Section 11.3) be formally resolved through binding arbitration. Binding arbitration means that an arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve such disputes. Consequently, you should read the entirety of this Section 11 carefully as it may significantly affect your legal rights.\n11.1 Informal Dispute Resolution.\nFor any and all disputes between you and BDG, the parties shall use their best efforts to settle informally the dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and to engage in good faith negotiations. Failure to engage in this process could result in the award of fees against you in arbitration.\nTo initiate informal dispute resolution, the initiating party must first send a written description of the dispute to the other party. For any dispute against BDG that you initiate, you agree to send to BDG (a) a written description of the dispute and (b) the email address(es) associated with your account through the following email address: legal@bustle.com. The written description must be on an individual basis and provide, at minimum, the following information: your name; a description of the nature or basis of the claim or dispute; and the specific relief sought. For any dispute that BDG initiates, we will send our written description of the dispute to the email address associated with your use of the Services.\nIf the parties\u2019 dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the written description of the dispute by a party, you and BDG agree to resolve any remaining dispute through the additional dispute resolution provisions set forth below.\nA good faith engagement in informal dispute resolution shall be and is a prerequisite and condition precedent to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. The parties agree that any applicable statute of limitations period and filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process.\n11.2 Binding Arbitration\nAfter the parties have engaged in a good-faith effort to resolve their dispute(s) in accordance with the Informal Dispute Resolution process (Section 11.1), and only if those efforts fail, then either party may initiate arbitration as set forth in this Section.\nIf you determine to initiate arbitration, a copy of the arbitration demand must be emailed to legal@bustle.com. If BDG is initiating arbitration, it will serve a copy of the demand to the email address associated with your use of the BDG Services.\n(a) Mutual Arbitration Agreement\nExcept as set forth in Section 11.3 below, you and BDG agree that all claims, disputes, or disagreements that may arise out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, formation, or performance of these Terms of Service\u2014 including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these terms are void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment, non-payment, or timing of any administrative or arbitrator fees\u2014shall be resolved exclusively through binding arbitration in accordance with this Section 11.2 (collectively, the \u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d). The arbitrator shall be empowered under this Arbitration Agreement to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with the arbitration provider\u2019s rules and procedures for any frivolous claims or submissions the arbitrator determines have not been filed in good faith, as well as for a party\u2019s failure to comply with this Section 11.2.\nThis Arbitration Agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly, and it applies to claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this Arbitration Agreement or any prior agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Arbitration Agreement, in accordance with the notice opt-out provisions set forth in Sections 11.4 and 11.5.\nThis Arbitration Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (\u201cFAA\u201d) in all respects and evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. You and BDG expressly agree that the FAA shall exclusively govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. If for whatever reason the rules and procedures of the FAA cannot apply, the state law governing arbitration agreements in the state in which you reside shall apply.\nExcept as set forth in Section 11.2(c) below, if any provision of this Arbitration Agreement is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to the parties\u2019 intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions thereof remain in full force and effect.\n(b) WAIVER OF RIGHTS INCLUDING JURY TRIAL\nTHE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT ARBITRATION MEANS THAT AN ARBITRATOR AND NOT A JUDGE OR JURY WILL DECIDE THE CLAIM, AND THAT RIGHTS TO DISCOVERY AND APPEALS MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. THE PARTIES FURTHER UNDERSTAND THAT THE COSTS OF ARBITRATION COULD EXCEED THE COST OF LITIGATION IN SOME INSTANCES.\nYOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS AND ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU AND BDG ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.\n(c) CLASS ARBITRATION AND COLLECTIVE RELIEF WAIVER.\nYOU AND BDG ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, AND EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET OUT IN THIS SECTION 11.2(c) AND SECTION 11.2(e)(vi) BELOW, ANY ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY ONLY AND NOT AS A CLASS OR OTHER CONSOLIDATED ACTION, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO RESOLVE AN INDIVIDUAL PARTY\u2019S CLAIM; NOTWITHSTANDING THIS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND AGREEMENT, ANY ARBITRATION INVOLVING YOU MAY PROCEED ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS IF AND ONLY IF BDG PROVIDES ITS CONSENT TO CONSOLIDATE IN WRITING.\nIf there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this Paragraph\u2019s limitations as to a particular remedy, then that remedy (and only that remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be sought in court. The parties agree, however, that any adjudication of remedies not subject to arbitration shall be stayed pending the outcome of any arbitrable claims and remedies.\nIf there is a final judicial determination that either the Class Arbitration and Collective Relief Waiver in this Section, or that the provisions in this Section 11.2 are not enforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief, then the parties agree that that particular claim or request for relief may proceed in court as provided herein, but shall be severed and stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims. This provision does not prevent you or BDG from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.\n(d) Arbitration Location.\nIf you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place in the county where you reside. For residents in Canada (and anywhere else outside the United States), arbitration shall be initiated in the County of New York, State of New York, United States of America, unless you and BDG otherwise agree or unless the designated arbitrator determines that such venue would be unreasonably burdensome to any party, in which case the arbitrator shall have the discretion to select another venue.\nFor any arbitration conducted in the County of New York, State of New York, United States of America, You and BDG agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in New York County, New York, in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and in connection with any such proceeding, further agree to accept service of process by U.S. or certified mail and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available\n(e) The Arbitration Rules.\n(i) The Provider.\nThe arbitration will be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (\u201cNAM\u201d) and resolved before a single arbitrator. If NAM is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitration provider.\nExcept as modified by this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d provision, NAM will administer the arbitration in accordance with the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, Fees For Disputes When One of the Parties is a Consumer and the Mass Filing Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions. The applicable NAM rules and procedures are available at http://www.namadr.com or by emailing National Arbitration and Mediation\u2019s Commercial Dept at commercial@namadr.com.\nYou are responsible for your own attorneys\u2019 fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.\nThe parties agree that NAM has discretion to reduce the amount or modify the timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under NAM\u2019s Rules where it deems appropriate, provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you further agree that you waive any objection to such fee modification. The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by NAM does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Section 11 while such challenge remains pending before NAM the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction, and that any and all due dates for those fees shall be tolled during the pendency of such challenge.\n(ii) Arbitration Demand Must Contain Sufficient Information.\nAny arbitration demand or counterclaim asserted by either party must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting party\u2019s identity, the claims being asserted, and the factual allegations on which they are based, and must include proof that the claimant is party to this Arbitration Agreement and to these Terms of Service. The arbitrator and/or NAM may require amendment of any demand or counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions for any claims the arbitrator determines to be frivolous or improper (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11), including for any claim filed on behalf of a claimant who is not a party to this Arbitration Agreement or to these Terms of Service.\n(iii) Arbitration Conducted on Papers in Some Circumstances.\nIf the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000 and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents that you and BDG submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, either party may request (or the arbitrator may determine) to hold a hearing. Any hearing shall presumptively be held via videoconference or telephone conference unless the arbitrator determines there is good cause to hold the hearing in-person or the parties agree otherwise, in which case the hearing will be held at the location identified in Section 11(d).\n(iv) Dispositive Motions.\nSubject to the applicable NAM rules and procedures, the parties agree that the arbitrator will have the discretion to allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute.\n(v) Batching.\nTo increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event 100 or more similar arbitration demands (those asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted to NAM (or another arbitration provider selected in accordance with Section 11.2(e)(i) if NAM is unavailable) against BDG within reasonably close temporal proximity (\u201cMass Filing\u201d), the parties agree (A) to administer the Mass Filing in batches of 100 demands per batch (to the extent there are fewer than 100 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch will consist of the remaining demands) with only one batch filed, processed, and adjudicated at a time; (B) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; (C) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined by NAM (or another arbitration provider selected in accordance with 11.2(e)(i) if NAM is unavailable) in its discretion; (D) that no other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the prior batch of 100 is filed, processed, and adjudicated; (e) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by BDG and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a set of batch proceedings and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; and (F) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each set including 100 demands, shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved. If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, any statute of limitation applicable to your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or settled.\nArbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted to the greatest extent possible in accordance with the applicable NAM rules and procedures for such selection, and shall be subject to any rights to strike an arbitrator provided under applicable state law if the rights granted by law exceed those provided for in the NAM rules, and the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings will be conducted.\nYou agree to cooperate in good faith with BDG and the arbitration provider to implement such a \u201cbatch approach\u201d or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims. The parties further agree to cooperate with each other and the arbitration provider or arbitrator to establish any other processes or procedures that the arbitration provider or arbitrator believe will provide for an efficient resolution of claims. For example, if the number of cases filed makes batches of 100 cases too small for the prompt resolution of all filed claims, you and we agree that NAM may increase or decrease the batch size, or transfer a case between batches in the reasoned discretion of the NAM procedural arbitrator. Any and all disagreements between the parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a NAM procedural arbitrator.\nThis \u201cBatch Arbitration\u201d provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM\u2019s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind.\n(vi) No Class or Consolidated Arbitration Absent Written Consent.\nUnless BDG otherwise consents in writing, which it may do on a case-by-case basis, BDG does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in Section 11.2(c) and this Section 11.2(e)(vi).\n(vii) Arbitration Award.\nThe arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the applicable NAM rules and procedures. The arbitrator\u2019s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant, on an individual basis, any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual to the extent available under applicable law, the arbitral forum\u2019s rules, and this Arbitration Agreement. The parties agree that the damages and/or other relief must be consistent with Section 11.2(c) above, and also must be consistent with the terms of the \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d section of these Terms of Service as to the types and the amounts of damages or other relief for which a party may be held liable. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. Attorneys\u2019 fees will be available to the prevailing party in the arbitration only if authorized under applicable substantive law governing the claims in the arbitration.\n11.3 Exceptions to Arbitration.\nNotwithstanding the parties\u2019 agreement to resolve all disputes through binding arbitration as set forth in Section 11.2:\n(a) IP Disputes.\nEither party\u2019s claims of infringement or misappropriation of the other party\u2019s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret, shall be exclusively brought in the state and federal courts located in the City and County of New York, New York.\n(b) Small Claims Court and Statutes of Limitation.\nEither party may elect to have disputes or claims resolved in a small claims court regardless of what forum the filing party initially chose, provided the disputes or claims are within the scope of that court\u2019s jurisdiction.\nEither party may also seek a declaratory judgment or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party\u2019s claims are time-barred or may be in fact be brought in small claims court. Seeking such relief shall not waive a party\u2019s right to arbitration under this agreement, and any filed arbitrations related to any action filed pursuant to this paragraph shall automatically be stayed (and any applicable statute of limitations tolled) pending the outcome of such action.\n(c) Jurisdiction/Service of Process.\nFor any dispute not subject to arbitration under this Section 11, you and BDG agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of and venue in the federal and state courts located in New York, New York. You further agree to accept service of process by U.S. or certified mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.\n11.4 30-Day Right to Opt Out.\nYou have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice, signed by you, of your decision to opt-out to the following address: privacy@BDG.com. The notice must be sent within 30 days of the date the revision is posted or your first use of the Services, whichever is later; otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of Section 11.2. If you opt-out of the arbitration provisions, BDG also will not be bound by them.\nIf you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, you may exercise your right to a trial by jury or judge, as permitted by applicable law, but any prior existing agreement to arbitrate disputes under a prior version of the Arbitration Agreement will not apply to claims not yet filed. If BDG changes this \u201cDispute Resolution\u201d section after the date you first accepted this Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement), you agree that your continued use of the Services 30 days after such change will be deemed acceptance of those changes.

      "text": "Secure The Bag\nThe Sydney Sweeney-Approved Chlo\u00e9 Bracelet Bag Is Practically Jewelry\nIt\u2019s a 2000s revival.\nBack in the noughties, the style consensus was this: being a Chlo\u00e9 girl was peak fashion. After all, the biggest It girls were. If the likes of the Olsen twins, Sienna Miller, and Kate Moss weren\u2019t carrying their favorite carryalls from the brand, they were consistently rocking boho-chic. As with most aesthetics, the fashion cycle kicked in and the look faded down for a hot minute, until the label appointed Chemena Kamali to take over as creative director in October 2023.\nWithin months, the brand was restored to its former It girl-favorite glory, with a new harem of industry icons embracing the label: Sydney Sweeney, Daisy Edgar-Jones, and Jennifer Lopez, among others. From her debut collection, which she unveiled during Paris Fashion Week\u2019s Fall/Winter 2024 season, Kamali practically kickstarted the boho revival, and led fashion girlies to dust off their clogs and wedges and add their Paddington bags back to the roster. No one piece, however, has been as buzzy as the reimagined Chlo\u00e9 Bracelet.\nThe Chlo\u00e9 Bracelet\u2019s Long History\nA supple, slouchy crescent-shaped bag, the Bracelet is accented with coiled hardware on each end and connected by a massive metal ring, like its namesake accessory. It practically doubles as jewelry, for those particularly interested in a multi-purpose purchase.\nKamali\u2019s chic iteration has only been in the market for about a year, but its roots go as far back as Phoebe Philo\u2019s era at the French label, which lasted from 2001 to 2006. The OG Bracelet, which debuted as part the then-creative director\u2019s Spring/Summer 2002 collection, garnered an A-list fan base, including Beyonc\u00e9 and Kim Kardashian. Kamali\u2019s archival nod wasn\u2019t a mere historical homage; it was also a touching tribute and homecoming, especially since she got her design headstart at the French label under Philo, no less.\nThe key differences between the new version of the Bracelet and its older sister are the larger metal ring, the more polished finish, and, most notably, the fact that the ring is now detachable.\nCelebs Love The Bag\nThough the bag has only been in the market for less than a year, A-listers have flocked to the nostalgic arm candy. For example, Sweeney, who already boasts an impressive collection of designer handbags, stepped out carrying a caramel brown Bracelet in January.\nMonths later, while attending the Taormina Film Festival, Olivia Wilde accented her lace slip with the gilded bag on a red carpet, in a rich maroon suede.\nOther celebrities have also been spotted toting the style, including Kiernan Shipka, Cristin Milioti, and Sienna Miller, who loved the first, Philo-era edition of the Bracelet.\nWait, The Bracelet Costs How Much?!\nAnyone eyeing the Bracelet has options. Though it only comes in two sizes (a small and a large), it\u2019s offered in several materials including leather and suede, as well as more limited styles featuring crochet, snakeskin, studs, or fringe. If you\u2019re not a fan of the circular handgrip, some are available in a golden \u201cbanana handle.\u201d\nThe leather mini retails for $2,690 and the prices go up to $5,790 for the fringed leather bag. Some limited edition styles, like a crescent crochet tote, sells for $1,750 and would be perfect for summer. Don\u2019t be deterred by the price \u2014 the bag is especially versatile and can be worn several ways. With the bracelet, one can carry it as a clutch or as a top-handle bag. Meanwhile, for those who prefer a more hands-free approach, detach the handle and wear it with the accompanying strap as a shoulder or crossbody bag."
