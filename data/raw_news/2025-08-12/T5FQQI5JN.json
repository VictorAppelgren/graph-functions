  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None USA Rare Earth stock has underperformed since going public through a SPAC merger in March.\n\u2022 None While the stock is down since its IPO, it's seen a huge rally over the last few months.\n\u2022 None Political dynamics could continue to increase U.S. support for domestic rare earth mineral sourcing.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than USA Rare Earth \u203a\n\nUSA Rare Earth (NASDAQ: USAR) went public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in March, and the stock has seen volatile trading since. As of close of trading Aug. 11, the company's share price is down roughly 16% since it had its initial public offering (IPO). That means that a $1,000 investment in the stock would now be worth roughly $832.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nUSA Rare Earth's business is still in a pre-revenue state, and there's still significant uncertainty when it comes to the outlook for launching and scaling its commercial operations. The company says its mission is to \"establish a U.S. rare earth magnet supply chain supporting the future state of energy, mobility, and national security.\"\n\nThe stock has been subject to high levels of valuation volatility across its relatively short history as a publicly traded company. On the other hand, the stock has also seen a strong rally recently -- and its share price is up 60% over the last three months.\n\nCharting USA Rare Earth's outlook involves a high degree of speculation and guesswork, but some significant political dynamics seem to be coalescing in the mining specialist's favor. In particular, the stock got a huge boost in April after President Donald Trump signed an executive order to bolster the United States' rare earth mineral sourcing capabilities through expedited permitting.\n\nThere's a good chance that the administration will continue to make moves to strengthen the country's mineral mining industry. Along those lines, a recent report from Reuters said that the Trump administration is looking into supporting domestic mineral providers by guaranteeing a base level of pricing for their products.\n\nThe U.S. still relies on China for a very large portion of its rare earth mineral sourcing. With tensions running high between the two countries and a high likelihood that both countries will continue making efforts to reduce their reliance on the other, it's probable that the U.S. will continue making some big moves to strengthen its domestic mineral sourcing capabilities. That doesn't guarantee that USA Rare Earth stock will go on to be a massive market beater, but the current political backdrop gives the company a chance to be a big winner.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in USA Rare Earth right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in USA Rare Earth, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and USA Rare Earth wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $653,427!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,119,863!*\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,060% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 182% for the S&P 500.

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

      "text": "A SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, is another name for a \"blank check company,\" meaning an entity with no commercial operations that completes an initial public offering (IPO).\nAfter becoming a public company, the SPAC then acquires, or usually merges with, an existing private company, taking it public. Before completing a merger or acquisition, many SPACs provide no indication to investors about the type of company they plan to merge with or buy.\nIn effect, the \"special purpose\" of a SPAC is to bring a promising private company to the public investment market. Although SPAC strategies can be complicated, they tend to take less time to complete than traditional IPO listings and can be cheaper. The advisory fees associated with going public via a SPAC tend to be much less than the fees charged for a traditional IPO.\nEarly-stage companies can more easily comply with the requirements to merge with a SPAC than to complete an IPO.\nWhat happens in a SPAC merger?\nWhat happens in a SPAC merger?\nSPACs start by raising capital on a stock exchange, typically pricing their common stock at $10 and offering warrants to buy additional shares as a sweetener to entice investors to buy into the unknown. The initial sale of stock is the SPAC raise, or SPAC IPO, and the money is held in a trust account until a merger partner is found.\nThe SPAC then identifies and negotiates a business combination with a private company, swapping the cash it raised via its initial public offering (IPO) and its status as a publicly traded entity for a percentage of the post-merger business. Institutional investors are often brought in to provide more cash to the combination, receiving shares of the target company in return.\nThe starting $10 share price tends to change once investors know the target company and the terms of the deal. Investors gain a better idea of share value, and the share price adjusts accordingly. SPAC share prices tend to soar when the acquisition target is announced, but if sentiment changes or the deal overly dilutes the value of the original shares by including too much money from new investors, a SPAC's share price may decline after the deal is announced.\nOnce a deal is announced, the de-SPAC transition begins. There is usually time between a formal merger announcement and the close of a deal when investors vote on the deal and other legal matters are resolved.\nOne of the first high-profile SPAC deals featured Richard Branson's space tourism start-up Virgin Galactic (SPCE -4.19%). In late 2019, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya formed a SPAC called Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings. The SPAC merged with Virgin Galactic, taking it public.\nShareholders of Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings received a 49% stake in the combined company, while Virgin Galactic received about $800 million in cash and a public ticker allowing it to trade on a stock exchange.\nSPACs generally have between 18 and 24 months to find a merger partner after raising money. If they do not, the funds held in the trust account are returned to investors.\nWhy would someone invest in a SPAC?\nWhy would someone invest in a SPAC?\nInvestors who buy into a SPAC prior to the announcement of a merger or acquisition are relying on the SPAC's sponsors -- its management team -- to choose an attractive target. For that reason, it matters who is sponsoring a SPAC.\nMany SPACs are backed by high-profile investors like Palihapitiya, while others affiliate with celebrities or famous athletes to attract attention.\nSPAC share prices tend to be relatively stable before the merger. A SPAC typically invests the money it raised when it was formed in government bonds or other safe investments to earn a modest return while limiting potential downside while it searches for a merger partner.\nBuying shares in a new SPAC amounts to a leap of faith, but the payoff can be substantial. The change in share price can occur immediately once a deal is announced, but the only way for an individual investor to fully benefit from that rapid price increase is to invest when the SPAC is still searching for a deal.\nDraftKings (DKNG -0.35%), the nearly decade-old company focused on fantasy sports, became a public company by merging with a SPAC early in 2020. The company's valuation quickly ballooned from about $3 billion to $13 billion in a matter of months. That's the sort of growth SPAC investors are trying to capture by committing money early.\nOne major benefit of not buying shares of a SPAC until after a merger is announced is that you know exactly what you're buying. But the rest of the market does, too, and the SPAC's share price likely already reflects that knowledge.\nExpert views\nExpert views on SPACs\nJay Ritter, PhD\nWhat do you think makes tech, energy, and healthcare especially appealing for SPAC sponsors and targets?\nJay R. Ritter, PhD: \u201cIf individual investors are excited about a sector, it is easier to find operating companies willing to tap into the investor enthusiasm by going public. One of the patterns that behavioral finance researchers have documented is that people tend to chase past returns. During the SPAC boom of 2020-2021, there was a lot of enthusiasm for electric cars and autonomous vehicles, partly fueled by Tesla\u2019s soaring share price. A lot of the startup companies in this sector wanted to grow quickly, and that required cash. Many healthcare companies, especially life science startups, need cash to finance their R&D activities. In all financial markets, a combination of the supply of shares by companies and demand from investors for these shares generates the transactions.\u201d\nWhat should retail investors look for when evaluating a SPAC opportunity today\u2014especially given the steep average de-SPAC losses across most sectors?\nJay R. Ritter, PhD: \u201cBuying a SPAC IPO, which typically is a unit sold for $10.00 that is composed of a share + a fraction of a warrant, is a safe investment that generally returns $10 + interest and gives some additional upside potential. The SPAC IPOs typically are bought by hedge funds, but individuals can usually buy them in the market at a little over $10, such as $10.05. The unit almost always splits into its two parts\u2014the share and the fraction of a warrant. If a SPAC announces that it will merge with a private operating company, the shareholders have the right to ask for their money back with interest, a process known as redeeming. The investor can keep the warrant, which gives some upside. In almost all proposed mergers, 98-99% of the shareholders ask for their money back. At the time of the merger, an investor should look at the price of the stock. If it is selling for just $10 + interest, asking for your money back is the best strategy, and 99% of investors do this. For these deals, after the merger, the stock almost always plummets in price. For a small percentage of deals, however, such as Digital World Acquisition Company\u2019s merger with Trump Media in March 2024, the stock price was well above $10 + interest, so keeping the shares or selling them in the market was a better strategy than redeeming.\"\nBenjamin Kwasnick\nAre there any signs that the SPAC model is evolving\u2014perhaps in structure, sponsor incentives, or target selection \u2013 to address its reputation for overall poor returns?\nBenjamin Kwasnick: \u201cThe model is certainly evolving, but most of the changes have been incremental in nature so far. An important thing to remember is that a SPAC is often the quickest way for a company to become a publicly traded stock. This means that early stage companies without fully proven business models are always going to consider a SPAC listing. In 2021, SPACs listed numerous electric vehicle companies (many of which ultimately traded poorly), but many others experienced similar performance through the traditional IPO route...\nWhen the market is enthusiastic about a broad class of early-stage companies, investors should be prepared that there may ultimately be only a few winners from an entire category. SPACs will likely continue to participate in situations like this.\u201d\nWhat should retail investors look for when evaluating a SPAC opportunity today \u2013 especially given the steep average de-SPAC losses across most sectors?\nBenjamin Kwasnick: \u201cRetail investors are often aware that investing in memes and themes can be a game of hot potato. Investors should be conscious of whether they're buying a trend or investing on fundamentals. When trend investing, investors should know that individual names can have rapid wide swings in price. When investing in fundamentals, investors may want to put more detailed work in on a company's earnings, revenue, and growth trajectory, particularly in comparison with other already existing publicly traded comparables.\u201d\nDouglas S. Ellenoff\nWhat do you think makes tech, energy, and healthcare especially appealing for SPAC sponsors and targets?\nDouglas S. Ellenoff: \u201cInvestors interested in deSPAC transactions generally prefer high return opportunities that are consistent with the profiles of those industries.\u201d\nWhat should retail investors look for when evaluating a SPAC opportunity today\u2014especially given the steep average de-SPAC losses across most sectors?\nDouglas S. Ellenoff: \u201cPublic investors understand the risks associated with most means of going public, whether it\u2019s a traditional IPO (which performed equally poorly when the bubble deflated) or through a SPAC. Both institutional investors and retail investors want access to high return investments and so long as the associated risks are fully disclosed (as they have been), they are prepared to invest in new public companies, including direct listings, which may performed even worse. When it comes to crypto, any investor must accept that these are relatively new instruments and not withstanding the scarcity value of the number of tokens, all instruments bare the same risk of being able to go down as they have in the past.\u201d\nRelated investing topics\nA word of caution on investing in SPACs\nA word of caution on investing in SPACs\nAlthough investing in SPACs theoretically enables individual investors to gain portfolio exposure to young companies in red-hot sectors, it's important to remember that disclosure rules for SPAC deals differ from the disclosure rules governing IPOs.\nFor IPOs, companies are permitted to share past financial results and talk broadly about the markets in which they operate, but they are prohibited from projecting future financial performance. In contrast, a company going public via a SPAC deal is allowed to present detailed revenue and profit projections that are forward-looking by five years or more.\nFor young, pre-revenue companies that might prefer for investors to focus on their potential instead of their unimpressive results so far, that regulatory distinction confers a significant benefit.\nExactly how far SPACs are allowed to project is still a matter of debate. We've seen the Securities and Exchange Commission launch a number of investigations into SPAC deals focused on what was disclosed and how realistic it was. Future deals are likely to be adjusted based on how the Securities and Exchange Commission views these things.\nSEC (Securities and Exchange Commission)\nIf nothing else, investors should be aware that the rules are different than with an IPO.\nThe traditional IPO process is cumbersome and restrictive, partly to ensure individual investors are protected. Investors invariably lose some protections when they invest in SPACs. Investing in younger, less-established companies carries greater upside potential but also greater risk.\nA cautionary tale is the SPAC merger deal between VectoIQ (NASDAQ:VTIQ) and electric truck start-up Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA). VectoIQ shares rapidly increased in value in March 2020 when the merger deal was announced, and they were up by more than 600% by midsummer of 2020. Later in the summer, after the merger closed, questions surfaced about the viability of Nikola's products.\nBy June 2023, shares of Nikola were trading for less than $1, and the company's market capitalization was less than $400 million -- 99% less than the stock's all-time high.\nIt's impossible to know whether an IPO would have raised enough red flags about Nikola for investors, but in hindsight, clearly insufficient due diligence was conducted before the SPAC merger was completed."

  "argos_summary": "USA Rare Earth, which went public via a SPAC merger in March, has seen its stock decline approximately 16% since its IPO, despite a recent rally of 60% over the last three months. The company is still in a pre-revenue phase, and its future depends on political support for domestic rare earth mineral sourcing, especially amid U.S.-China tensions. Analysts suggest that while the stock's outlook is speculative, the current political climate may provide opportunities for growth.",
