  "title": "Lost Android phones will soon greet finders with a new warning screen (APK teardown)",
  "description": "Google is testing a refreshed warning screen with Material 3 Expressive design for Android phones that are marked as lost using Find Hub.",
  "content": "Back in May this year, Google renamed Find My Device, the app that lets you track and locate your phone, smart tags, or audio accessories if you can\u2019t find them, to Find Hub. Over the following months, Google has been rolling out promised features, including satellite-based tracking, to Find Hub with the new Pixel 10 series phones. Additionally, it has also been testing a redesign alongside a splash of new visuals with the new Material 3 Expressive design philosophy in Find Hub, and we are now seeing more evidence of that across multiple screens.\n\nFollowing our recent discovery of Expressive redesign in Find Hub, we have identified a new trial interface that appears when a device is marked as lost. These changes don\u2019t appear to be tied to the Find Hub app itself, but instead appear following the Google Play Services\u2019 update to version 25.34.32, which makes sense since Find Hub is part of Google Play Services. Do note, these changes aren\u2019t rolling out widely, and we spotted them as part of a teardown.\n\nWith this new interface, we see a completely overhauled screen that appears when a phone is marked as lost. This screen locks down the interface and displays the owner\u2019s contact details instead of the standard lock screen. The new screen visibly aligns with the other Material 3 Expressive remods we have seen so far, with a colorful background and new buttons.\n\nThe new page emphasizes that this phone is lost or stolen, with a new, centrally placed text. As opposed to saying \u201cLocked by Find Hub\u201d earlier, the new screen uses a bigger and bolder font with a new text that says \u201cThis phone has been lost\u201d right above the owner\u2019s name.\n\nBelow the owner\u2019s name, there are buttons that let you call the owner, contact emergency services, or unlock the phone if you are the actual owner, i.e., you know the PIN. If the phone owner does not enter a contact number while locking the phone, only two buttons are displayed, which are for unlocking the phone and calling emergency services.\n\nSince Google is already rolling out Material 3 Expressive to a host of other apps, we expect it to be rolled out on Find Hub soon. However, it is difficult for us to answer how soon that happens, especially since some of Google\u2019s own apps have been misbehaving following the redesign.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f An APK teardown helps predict features that may arrive on a service in the future based on work-in-progress code. However, it is possible that such predicted features may not make it to a public release.",

Learn more.\nGoogle Maps, Find Hub on the Pixel 10 just gained satellite-based live location sharing powers\nAugust 21, 2025\n- With the launch of the Pixel 10 series, both Find Hub and Google Maps now support satellite-based live location sharing.\n- Pixel 10 users can send their live location even without cellular coverage, using Skylo\u2019s satellite network.\n- Google Maps, Find Hub, and Messages will also support live location sharing on the Pixel 10 with T-Mobile\u2019s T-Satellite. Soon, other devices on T-Satellite will also get this feature on the above apps.\nAs part of the Find Hub rebrand announced at Google I/O, Google also announced its plans to expand Find Hub to support satellite connectivity. Google didn\u2019t share more details then, but we recently spotted more details about how Find Hub\u2019s satellite location sharing would work. With the launch of the Pixel 10 series, Find Hub now officially supports satellite-based location sharing, and so does Google Maps.\nDon\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority?\n- Set us as a preferred source in Google Search to support us and make sure you never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more.\nSkylo has announced an extension of its partnership with Google, bringing several satellite connectivity features to its new hardware lineup. Amongst these, we get standalone satellite connectivity on the Pixel Watch 4 LTE. The Pixel 10 also has the usual satellite connectivity features, but it has also become the first phone to get satellite-based location sharing in Android 16.\nPixel 10 users can send their live location even without cellular coverage, using Skylo\u2019s satellite network. Recipients will see a satellite icon on the shared location pin, indicating their off-grid status. Satellite-based location sharing can be done through Google Maps or Find Hub.\nSkylo mentions that satellite-based location sharing will be available on the Pixel 9 series as well, which is good news. We\u2019ll keep you updated when we learn more.\nIf you aren\u2019t keen on getting a Pixel 9 or 10 for satellite connectivity, note that T-Mobile\u2019s T-Satellite also supports location sharing and other features like text messaging. T-Mobile also notes that Google Maps, Find Hub, and Messages are now available for use with T-Satellite \u2014 on the Pixel 10 series, but expanding to more devices once T-Satellite becomes data-ready on October 1.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nFind Hub is the next Google app to get an Expressive coat of paint (APK teardown)\nAugust 15, 2025\n- We\u2019ve conducted a teardown of Google\u2019s Find Hub app and discovered a variety of visual changes.\n- These tweaks are broadly in line with Google\u2019s push to adopt the Material 3 Expressive style.\nGoogle\u2019s Find Hub is your one-stop shop for tracking your devices, accessories, and even loved ones. Now, it looks like Google is bringing some Material 3 Expressive changes to this app as well.\nWe conducted a teardown of the latest version of the Find Hub app (version 3.1.399-3) and managed to enable a variety of visual changes. These tweaks are all in line with Google\u2019s Material 3 Expressive style. You can view the screens below.\nFor starters, the Device details page (screens one and two) now shows a centered image of your device. We also have larger, bolder headers, while the factory reset button is now encased in that distinctive pill-shaped box.\nDon\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority?\n- Set us as a preferred source in Google Search to support us and make sure you never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more.\nThe contact info page (screens three and four) has seen the biggest changes. Google has ditched the \u201cContact info\u201d header in favor of \u201cEnter phone number and a message.\u201d Furthermore, the device image and displayed email address have been removed, while the message box is much larger.\nFind Hub\u2019s map view has also undergone some changes, as we can see in the second row of images. The bottom sheet no longer shows pictures of your devices. However, the map view now shows your device images on the map itself instead of a generic device image. The settings and refresh buttons in the bottom sheet have also been tweaked and are now circular buttons.\nIn any event, this isn\u2019t a groundbreaking design overhaul by any means. But it does suggest that Google is putting plenty of effort into ensuring that its Material 3 Expressive design covers as many of its apps as possible. That\u2019s welcome news for those of us who remember Google\u2019s relatively slow progress when it came to dark mode.\nThis tweaked design isn\u2019t the only thing we found in Find Hub this week. It looks like you can soon add a home screen shortcut for specific people who are sharing their location with you. That\u2019s handy if you want a quick way to track a child or another loved one without wading through the app. We also recently got a better idea of how satellite-based location sharing will work.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nGoogle\u2019s Expressive Clock redesign is already ticking people off\n11 hours ago\n- The new Google Clock Material 3 Expressive redesign glitches, with jittering digits as the time moves.\n- Some layouts are messy under specific settings, forcing scrolling or text wrapping.\n- Complaints are piling up on Reddit and Google\u2019s support forum.\nGoogle\u2019s flashy Expressive makeover for the Clock app was supposed to be a simple style update, but plenty of people are unimpressed, to say the least. Across Reddit and Google support forums, people are finding the redesigned app jittery, awkward, and generally a bit of a mess.\nDon\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority?\n- Set us as a preferred source in Google Search to support us and make sure you never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more.\nOn the r/GooglePixel subreddit, one complaint shows the time jittering every second in the World Clock view, with the font resizing and the lower UI shifting around each time the digits change. \u201cIt\u2019s so bad it\u2019s funny,\u201d reads the most upvoted response.\nIt\u2019s a similar story over on r/NothingTech, with another video highlighting the jittery issue on the stopwatch. The variable-width font makes the numbers shift horizontally as they tick up, giving the impression that the whole display is unstable. It\u2019s not exactly ideal when trying to focus on precise timing. Some users said enabling bold text makes it even worse. The video below comes from AleksLevet\u2019s Reddit post.\nThis horizontal movement of the numbers isn\u2019t the only design gripe. A separate post from a Nothing user shows that the oversized new layout can no longer fit all controls on one page, forcing them to scroll slightly to see everything.\nMeanwhile, on Google\u2019s support forum, users reported the word \u201cStopwatch\u201d being split in half because of the larger font sizing, with the \u201ch\u201d sitting on a second line. The only obvious fix appears to be shrinking the text system-wide.\nDo you like the new Google Clock snooze button?\nNot everyone sees all of these issues, as they seem to depend on display size, font choice, and other settings. But that\u2019s arguably part of the frustration \u2014 Google\u2019s default apps should be robust enough to handle those scenarios smoothly. Instead, the Google Clock redesign feels half-baked, with complaints piling up just days after the rollout began.\nFor now, the only advice from Google\u2019s support forum is to submit feedback and wait for a patch. Let us know in the comments if you\u2019ve experienced similar issues.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

Learn more.\nAndroid Find My Device is now Find Hub, and it\u2019s about more than just phones\nMay 13, 2025\n- Find My Device is now the Find Hub.\n- Google\u2019s rebranding represents the tool\u2019s expansion earlier this year to also help locate people.\n- Before the end of 2025, the Find Hub will get support for satellite connectivity.\nSo many of us are far more reliant on our devices than we might like to admit, leaning on them to help find our way around town, to find a new restaurant to check out for dinner, or to find tomorrow\u2019s forecast. But what do we do when we can\u2019t find our phones themselves? Android\u2019s Find My Device tool has offered a handy way to let us track down missing hardware, and we just saw Google give it a major feature upgrade with the ability to also find people. As its scope grows beyond devices, Google\u2019s doing the only sensible thing and rebranding Find My Device with a new identity.\nAs Find My Device is now more and more a hub for finding all manner of important things and people in our lives, Google shares that it will now be known as the Find Hub \u2014 how appropriate!\nFunctionally, that\u2019s not going to mean any changes straight away. The Android Find Hub will be your place for locating Android devices, connected accessories, Bluetooth trackers, and now people, too. Google does share a little bit of news to look forward to in terms of new tracker launches and support going live over the coming months, like Peak Skis brining Bluetooth tracking to its lineup, so you\u2019re not digging through random mountains of powder looking for your lost gear, or Pixbee working on some new Disney-themed tags.\nGoing forward, though, we can look forward to some tracking updates, and later this year Google plans to expand the Find Hub to support satellite connectivity. We\u2019ve yet to hear all the details about how that\u2019s going to work, so you may want to temper your enthusiasm a smidge, but the idea sounds just chock full of potential, and represents what feels like a truly useful, obvious way to tap into Android\u2019s growing ability to access satellite communication.\nThe new Find Hub rebranding should start rolling out today, May 13. Google\u2019s got even more Find Hub news for Android users today, sharing word of partnerships with airlines to help find your lost luggage, and UWB support finally arriving.\nThank you for being part of our community.

  "argos_summary": "Google has renamed Find My Device to Find Hub, expanding its scope to include locating people and accessories and adding satellite-based live location sharing on Pixel 10 and upcoming devices. The app is receiving a Material\u00a03 Expressive visual overhaul, with new color schemes, larger headers, and redesigned buttons across its screens. A new warning screen appears when a phone is marked lost, showing the owner\u2019s contact info and options to call, unlock, or contact emergency services. Satellite connectivity is enabled via Skylo and T\u2011Satellite, allowing location sharing even without cellular coverage, and the feature is slated to roll out to more devices later in the year. The redesign and satellite features are still rolling out and may be refined after user feedback.",
