The growth was primarily attributable to the addition of My Home Group in November 2024.\n\nSegment revenue for the 2025 second quarter, compared with the 2024 second quarter was as follows:\n\nGAAP net loss for the second quarter of 2025 was $3.6 million, or $0.13 per share, compared to a net loss of $1.3 million, or $0.07 per share, in the second quarter of 2024. The year-over-year increase in net loss was primarily attributable to the gain recognized from the sale of the Company's insurance business in May 2024, which favorably impacted the prior year's results.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA*, a non-GAAP measure, for the second quarter of 2025 totaled $0.03 million, compared to $0.2 million in the second quarter of 2024. The second quarter of 2025 marked the Company's first positive Adjusted EBITDA* quarter since the second quarter of 2024. Fathom is committed to remaining Adjusted EBITDA* positive moving forward.\n\nFirst Six Months of 2025 Financial Results\n\nReal estate transactions increased approximately 28.5% year-over-year to 22,425 transactions in the first half of 2025. The increase in real estate transactions was primarily due to the addition of My Home Group in November 2024.\n\nTotal revenue for the first six months of 2025 increased 34.4% to $214.6 million, compared to $159.7 million in the same period of 2024. The increase was primarily driven by a 38.0% rise in brokerage revenue, largely attributable to the addition of My Home Group in November 2024. This growth was partially offset by a 13% decline in Fathom's other service revenue, primarily due to the absence of insurance revenue following the sale of the Company's insurance business in May 2024.\n\nSegment revenue for the 2025 first six months, compared with the 2024 first six months, was as follows:\n\nGAAP net loss for the first six months of 2025 was $9.2 million, or $0.36 per share, compared to a net loss of $7.2 million, or $0.37 per share, for the same period in 2024. The increase in net loss was primarily due to the gain recognized from the sale of the Company's insurance business in May 2024, which benefited the prior year's results.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA* loss, a non-GAAP measure, was $1.4 million in the first six months of 2025, compared with an Adjusted EBITDA* loss of approximately $1.3 million for the first six months of 2024. The Adjusted EBITDA* loss for the first six months of 2025 was primarily attributable to the lower total contribution of our ancillary businesses.\n\n*Fathom provides Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, because it offers additional information for monitoring the Company's cash flow performance. A table providing a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most comparable GAAP measure, as well as an explanation of, and important disclosures about, this non-GAAP measure, is included in the tables at the end of this press release.\n\nThe Company has elected to withhold guidance for the third quarter ending September 30, 2025. Management plans to reassess and potentially reinstate guidance expectations in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nFathom management will hold a conference call today (August 12, 2025) at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time (2:00 p.m. Pacific time) to discuss these financial results.\n\nPlease call the conference telephone number five minutes prior to the start time. An operator will register your name and organization.\n\nA live audio webcast of the conference call will be available in listen-only mode simultaneously and available via the investor relations section of the Company's website at FathomInc.com.\n\nA telephone replay of the call will be available through August 26, 2025.\n\nFathom Holdings Inc. is a national, technology-driven, real estate services platform integrating residential brokerage, mortgage, title, and SaaS offerings to brokerages and agents by leveraging its proprietary cloud-based software, intelliAgent. The Company's brands include Fathom Realty, Encompass Lending, intelliAgent, LiveBy, Real Results, Verus Title, and Cornerstone. For more information, visit .\n\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" that involve risks and uncertainties which we expect will or may occur in the future and may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous conditions, many of which are beyond the control of the Company, including: risks associated with general economic conditions, including rising interest rates; its ability to generate positive operational cash flow; risks associated with the Company's ability to continue achieving significant growth; its ability to continue its growth trajectory while achieving profitability over time; risks related to ongoing and future litigation; and other risks as set forth in the Risk Factors section of the Company's most recent Form 10-K as filed with the SEC and supplemented from time to time in other Company filings made with the SEC. Copies of Fathom's Form 10-K and other SEC filings are available on the SEC's website, www.sec.gov. The Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements for revisions or changes after the date of this release, except as required by law.\n\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. This non-GAAP financial measure, which may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies, is presented to enhance investors' overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\n\nWe define the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding other expense, income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, gain on sale of business benefit, NAR related litigation contingency expenses and transaction-related cost.\n\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information about our financial performance, enhances the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allows for greater transparency with respect to a key metric used by our management for financial and operational decision-making. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA helps identify underlying trends in our business that otherwise could be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in Adjusted EBITDA. In particular, we believe the exclusion of share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards and stock options and transaction-related costs associated with our acquisition activity provides a useful supplemental measure in evaluating the performance of our operations and provides better transparency into our results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes other income and expense, net which primarily includes nonrecurring items, such as, gain on debt extinguishment, gain on sale of business, severance costs, and non-cash items representing reserves on certain agent fee collection, if applicable.\n\nWe are presenting the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA to assist investors in seeing our financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe this measure provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA compared to net income (loss), the closest comparable GAAP measure. Some of these limitations are that:\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA excludes share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, and stock options, which have been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, significant recurring expenses in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA excludes transaction-related costs primarily consisting of professional fees and any other costs incurred directly related to acquisition activity, which is an ongoing part of our growth strategy and therefore likely to occur;\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and capitalized software costs, however, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future;\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA excludes the gain on the sale of the business, as this item is non-recurring and not indicative of the Company's core operating performance; and\n\u2022 Adjusted EBITDA excludes NAR related litigation expenses, which could continue to be significant recurring expenses in our business until a final settlement has been approved by the court.",

financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, to understand and evaluate our core operating performance. This non-GAAP financial measure, which may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies, is presented to enhance investors' overall understanding of our financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe define the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding other expense, income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, gain on sale of business benefit, NAR related litigation contingency expenses and transaction-related cost.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information about our financial performance, enhances the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allows for greater transparency with respect to a key metric used by our management for financial and operational decision-making. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA helps identify underlying trends in our business that otherwise could be masked by the effect of the expenses that we exclude in Adjusted EBITDA. In particular, we believe the exclusion of share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards and stock options and transaction-related costs associated with our acquisition activity provides a useful supplemental measure in evaluating the performance of our operations and provides better transparency into our results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes other income and expense, net which primarily includes nonrecurring items, such as, gain on debt extinguishment, gain on sale of business, severance costs, and non-cash items representing reserves on certain agent fee collection, if applicable.\nWe are presenting the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA to assist investors in seeing our financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe this measure provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing our core financial performance over multiple periods with other companies in our industry.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA compared to net income (loss), the closest comparable GAAP measure. Some of these limitations are that:\n- Adjusted EBITDA excludes share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, and stock options, which have been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, significant recurring expenses in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;\n- Adjusted EBITDA excludes transaction-related costs primarily consisting of professional fees and any other costs incurred directly related to acquisition activity, which is an ongoing part of our growth strategy and therefore likely to occur;\n- Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and capitalized software costs, however, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future;\n- Adjusted EBITDA excludes the gain on the sale of the business, as this item is non-recurring and not indicative of the Company's core operating performance; and\n- Adjusted EBITDA excludes NAR related litigation expenses, which could continue to be significant recurring expenses in our business until a final settlement has been approved by the court.\nSOURCE Fathom Holdings Inc.\nWANT YOUR COMPANY'S NEWS FEATURED ON PRNEWSWIRE.COM?\nNewsrooms &\nInfluencers\nDigital Media\nOutlets\nJournalists\nOpted In\nShare this article"
