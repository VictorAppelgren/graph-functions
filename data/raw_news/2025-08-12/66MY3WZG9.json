  "description": "Reggaeton singer-songwriter Jhayco, best known for his A-list collaborations with Bad Bunny and J Balvin, was reportedly arrested in Miami.",
  "content": "Reggaeton singer-songwriter Jhayco has been arrested in Florida after allegedly being found in possession of drugs, according to reports.\n\nThe Latin urban star, born Jesu\u0301s Manuel Nieves Corte\u0301s, was arrested in Miami early Tuesday morning, Aug. 12, and charged with cocaine possession and cannabis possession of 20 grams or less after being pulled over by police during a traffic stop, according to Rolling Stone, Variety and NBC 6 South Florida.\n\nBefore his arrest, Jhayco, 32, was reportedly driving at 5 mph and took over a minute to resume driving after coming to a complete stop, per Rolling Stone and NBC 6.\n\nWhen police approached the singer's car, a deputy reportedly observed a \"strong odor of cannabis\" coming from the vehicle, and that Jhayco had \"white powder\" on his pants and nose, Rolling Stone and NBC 6 report. He was allegedly unable to provide the police with a driver's license during the stop.\n\nAuthorities subsequently found two pouches of suspected cannabis with approximately seven grams each in Jhayco's car, per NBC 6. Additionally, police discovered that the Grammy-nominated singer had \"clear baggies with suspect powder cocaine,\" totaling about two grams, in his pockets, according to Rolling Stone and NBC 6.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the Miami-Dade County Sheriff's Office and representatives for Jhayco for comment.\n\nFollowing the incident, Jhayco was booked at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center, according to Variety. His bond was set at $3,000, the outlet reported alongside Rolling Stone and NBC 6.\n\nJhayco, formerly known as Jhay Cortez, started pursuing music in his teens after taking inspiration from the Puerto Rican-bred genre reggaeton and one of its leading artists, Don Omar, according to the singer's biography on the official Universal Music Latino website.\n\nAfter writing songs for the likes of Tito El Bambino, Zion & Lennox, Ozuna and Nicky Jam, Jhayco launched his solo career with the release of his 2019 debut album \"Famouz.\" The album featured the J Balvin and Bad Bunny collaboration, \"No Me Conoce,\" which peaked at No. 2 on Billboard's Latin Airplay chart and was later certified diamond for sales of over 5 million.\n\nJhayco and Bad Bunny have teamed up over the years for additional hits, including 2022's \"Tarot.\" The EDM-inflected reggaeton banger, featured on Bad Bunny's record-selling \"Un Verano Sin Ti\" album, helped earn Jhayco a Grammy nomination for album of the year in 2023.\n\nJhayco's latest album, \"Le Clique: Vida Rockstar (X),\" was released in September 2024. The hit record has since been certified double platinum.",

He was then pulled over.\nAccording to the deputy\u2019s report, the officials saw that Cortes had \u201cwhite powder on his pants and white powder on his nose,\u201d and that they noticed a \u201cstrong odor\u201d of cannabis coming from his vehicle.

      "text": "Diddy doubles down on defamation lawsuit over alleged sex assault videos, seeks $100M\nSean \"Diddy\" Combs is escalating his legal battle against one of his accusers and the news outlet that helped publicize his claims.\nCombs, who sued Courtney Burgess in January for $50 million on allegations of defamation, amended his complaint against the man in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on Aug. 11, according to court documents obtained by USA TODAY. Burgess' attorney, Ariel Mitchell, and news broadcaster NewsNation are also named as defendants in the lawsuit.\nThe Grammy-winning rapper is now seeking additional compensation, no less than $100 million in damages, for the \"severe reputational harm\" caused by Burgess' \"outlandish claims,\" which Combs' attorneys allege culminated in a \"media frenzy\" against the embattled hip-hop mogul.\n\"In this pitiful spectacle, all pretense of objectivity has been abandoned, as a global audience feasts at the all-you-can-eat buffet of wild lies and conspiracy theories,\" the lawsuit states. \"Mitchell and Burgess are among the worst perpetrators in this offensive scenario.\n\"They eagerly court every opportunity to broadcast blatant falsehoods, pretending they have proof that Mr. Combs engaged in heinous acts, knowing that no such proof exists,\" Combs' team alleges.\nCombs and his attorneys also accuse NewsNation, in its coverage of Burgess' claims, of \"lend(ing) its credibility to and amplify(ing) defendant Burgess and Mitchell's lies, giving them a mainstream media platform to malign (Combs) for defendants' collective profit.\"\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Mitchell and NewsNation for comment.\nIn an October 2024 interview aired by NewsNation, Burgess and Mitchell alleged that the man, who reportedly at one point testified in front of a grand jury for Combs' federal criminal case, possessed several videos purportedly showing Combs sexually assaulting minors, including celebrities, at his \"freak off\" sex parties.\nAt the time of his original lawsuit in January, Combs, who was awaiting trial in his landmark sex crimes case, sought $50 million in damages for Burgess and Mitchell's claims. The disgraced music mogul said the pair's remarks about \"freak off\" footage had the potential to \"poison the minds\" of people who might serve on Combs' jury.\nCombs was arrested in September 2024 on charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. In July, the rapper was found guilty on two charges of transportation to engage in prostitution and acquitted of the remaining offenses.\nThe rapper, who remains in custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, was denied bail on Aug. 4 after his legal team requested he be released on a $50 million bond.\nDiddy's team claims attorney Ariel Mitchell, NewsNation spread 'lies' about a Diddy accuser\nIn addition to their allegations about Burgess and Mitchell's claims, Combs and his legal team also accused Mitchell of spreading \"false statements\" about the rapper in another case involving a woman who alleged Combs sexually assaulted her in Northern California in March 2018.\nMitchell reportedly discussed the case in a NewsNation interview that aired in September 2024, claiming there was a police report that confirmed the woman's assault allegations.\nHowever, Combs' lawyers claimed in the lawsuit that the actual police report of the alleged incident did not identify Combs and \"thoroughly discredited\" the woman's claims against Combs. In a March 10 statement to USA TODAY, the Contra Costa Sheriff's Department said: \"A report was taken on March 23, 2018. We take these cases seriously, and detectives thoroughly investigated the accusations. It was later determined the claims were unfounded.\"\nThe attorneys added that NewsNation \"knew or recklessly disregarded\" the purported lack of credibility of Mitchell's account.\nFurther questioning NewsNation's relationship with Mitchell, Combs' attorneys cited several alleged ethics violations Mitchell has faced as a Florida-based attorney, including allegations of bribery and false statements to the media.\n\"Defendants made these false and defamatory statements in bad faith, as part of a deliberate effort to damage Mr. Combs' reputation, undermine his businesses and, by painting him as debauched and a pedophile, to poison the public's perception of him and deprive him of a fair trial.\"\n(This story was updated to add new information.)\nContributing: KiMi Robinson, USA TODAY"

      "text": "J Balvin talks 'Mixteip' album, fatherhood and taking it easy: 'Let life surprise me'\nJ Balvin has earned his superstar stripes, and now it's time to vacilar (have fun).\nThe multiplatinum Grammy-nominated Colombian singer is remapping his musical boundaries on his latest release, \"Mixteip\" (out now). The experimental 10-track mixtape sees Balvin playfully expand his signature reggaeton sound with fusions of hip-hop, merengue, salsa and drill rap.\n\"I feel confident that I gave my 1,000% on this project. The rest is out of my hands,\" Balvin tells USA TODAY. \"We're taking it more easy now. Of course, you want the mixtape to be successful and the songs to become a smash, but \u2026 I'd rather let life surprise me with it.\"\nComing off the release of 2024's \"Rayo,\" an eclectic album that broke new sonic ground for Balvin, the singer continues to be fueled by a sense of creative freedom. \"You suffer less,\" he explains, because you're not battling \"high expectations.\"\n\"Maybe because I'm more mature now \u2212 that helps too,\" says Balvin, who turned 40 in May. \"It makes me feel way more stable, not caring about things that I used to that hurt me a lot.\"\nWhy J Balvin channeled reggaeton nostalgia on 'Zun Zun'\nBalvin may be reggaeton royalty now, but he knows he's part of a larger dynasty.\nThe singer, who made his debut with 2013's \"La Familia,\" has scored 38 No. 1 hits on Billboard's Latin Rhythm Airplay chart, won three Latin Grammys for best urban album and was dubbed \"the undeniable leader of a second-generation reggaeton revolution\" by Guinness World Records.\nOn \"Mixteip,\" Balvin pays homage to the genre's roots with sensual banger \"Zun Zun.\" The track, a collaboration with Justin Quiles and Lenny Tav\u00e1rez, includes a shout-out to iconic production duo Luny Tunes, while its music video features a racy dance party that evokes the feel-good hedonism of classic reggaeton.\n\"If it wasn't for the 2000s or the late '90s, we wouldn't be (where we are),\" Balvin says. \"It just takes me to the old times when I dreamed to be an artist, so we wanted to take that sound back.\"\nJ Balvin gushes about fatherhood, 'amazing' girlfriend Valentina Ferrer\nWhen Balvin isn't cranking out the hits, he's a doting papi.\nThe \"Mi Gente\" singer became a father in 2021 when he and longtime girlfriend Valentina Ferrer welcomed son Rio. \"No matter what, my son has a beautiful and amazing mother who is raising him (in) the best way possible,\" Balvin says.\nWhile fatherhood hasn't softened Balvin's artistic edge, the singer reflects that family life has reshaped his experience of making music. \"My son makes my life better, happier. And when you feel that you're stable with your emotions, you have that health to go into the studio.\"\nAnd while Rio shares his father's love of singing, Balvin says, his parental focus is providing the 4-year-old with a grounded upbringing.\n\"I would never pressure my son to be a part of this industry. I think there's better ways to be happier,\" Balvin says. But \"whatever he wants to do, we're going to support him 1,000%\"\nJ Balvin collaborates with childhood idol Gilberto Santa Rosa on 'Mixteip'\nBalvin can cross off one more item on his musical bucket list.\nThe reggaetonero nabbed a collaboration with Puerto Rican singer and salsa icon Gilberto Santa Rosa for the \"Mixteip\" track \"Misterio,\" a bold mash-up that seamlessly weaves the singers' tropical and Latin urban styles.\nBalvin said Santa Rosa, who made history as the first tropical salsa singer to perform at New York City's Carnegie Hall, was a childhood influence, adding that Santa Rosa's live album \"blew my mind.\"\nTheir collaboration \"is one of my happiest moments in the last few years,\" Balvin says. \"We were just doing music, and we were like, 'This song would be perfect for Gilberto.'\"\nThe two are set to take the stage together July 24 for a performance on \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\"\nHow J Balvin is using 'the power of music' to lift the Latino community\nBalvin will always rep his Latino Gang, an affectionate shout-out to the Hispanic community that has become a lyrical call to arms.\nThe singer, who hails from Medell\u00edn, Colombia, had his Latin heritage on full display for his July 13 performance at the FIFA Club World Cup when his ensemble of backup dancers sported brightly colored tops that mirrored the design of the Colombian flag.\n\"It was beautiful that he we had the opportunity and (were able) to embrace and show the Latino culture and Colombia to the whole world,\" Balvin says.\nAlthough Balvin isn't an activist, the singer recognizes the power of his unapologetic cultural pride, especially amid a contentious political climate for the U.S. Latino community amid the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\"I don't like politics. I never talk about it; it's just not my thing,\" Balvin says. \"My passion is about human rights and using my platform \u2013 the power of music \u2013 to speak out about it. \u2026 Supporting our brothers and just creating the awareness that they're not alone.\""

      "text": "Bad Bunny is making history with his residency. It's not the first time he set records.\nBad Bunny, Benito, El Conejo Malo \u2013 no matter what you call him, the Puerto Rican musician is an undeniable force.\nSince his 2018 debut album, he\u2019s used his singular songs, bold fashion and social activism to amass a worldwide fandom and set industry records.\nSo it\u2019s not surprising that when the 31-year-old star announced his first concert residency earlier this year, he triggered a frenzy. The 30-date residency at Puerto Rico's largest arena, Coliseo de Puerto Rico, sold out in four hours and caused long lines of locals who waited to buy the tickets for the first nine shows, which are intended for the island\u2019s residents.\nBad Bunny\u2019s residency, aptly named No Me Quiero Ir de Aqu\u00ed (I Don\u2019t Want to Leave Here), is poised to be the largest in Puerto Rico\u2019s history and is expected to deliver a boon to its economy and visibility.\nLater this year, Bad Bunny will embark on the Deb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos world tour, which features more than 50 shows across four continents. It starts Nov. 21 in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and ends in Brussels, Belgium, on July 22, 2026. There have been no U.S. dates announced for the tour.\nAs Bad Bunny\u2019s Puerto Rico residency kicks off July 11, we look back at some of his record-setting accomplishments.\nFirst all-Spanish album to hit No. 1 on Billboard\nBad Bunny is familiar with chart success, boasting several No. 1 albums and 15 No. 1 hits on Billboard's Hot 100. But it was his third album, \"El \u00daltimo Tour del Mundo,\" that guaranteed him a spot in the history books. The 2020 reggaeton release was the first all-Spanish language album to reach No. 1 on Billboard's albums chart. Benito replicated that feat with his next three albums \u2013 \"Un Verano Sin Ti\" (2022), \"Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Ma\u00f1ana\" (2023) and \"Deb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\" (2025) \u2013 which all snagged No. 1 spots on Billboard.\nFirst all-Spanish album to get a Grammy album of the year nomination\nBad Bunny\u2019s \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti\u201d is a 23-song trove that spent a whopping 13 weeks in the top chart position. The commercial triumph was mirrored by critical acclaim and led the industry insiders of the Recording Academy to nominate it for album of the year at the 65th Grammy Awards. While the win went to Harry Styles' \"Harry's House,\" Bad Bunny\u2019s inclusion in the highly competitive all-genre category marked a new height in Latin music history.\nBad Bunny was also the first artist to win a best m\u00fasica urbana album Grammy after the category was introduced at the 64th awards for his \"El \u00daltimo Tour del Mundo\" album.\nMost streamed album on Spotify ever\nStreaming has been good to Bad Bunny. He\u2019s consistently among the most streamed global artists, finding himself among acts like Taylor Swift, Beyonc\u00e9, Post Malone, Ed Sheeran and The Weeknd on lists of popular listens. In fact, his \"Un Verano Sin Ti\" is the most streamed album on Spotify. Ever."

      "text": "Donald Trump misgenders reggaeton star Nicky Jam at rally: 'She's hot'\nNicky Jam has pledged allegiance to Donald Trump, but the former president seemingly had no idea who the reggaeton star was when introducing him at a Las Vegas rally over the weekend.\n\"Latin music superstar Nicky Jam. Do you know Nicky? She\u2019s hot,\" Trump said during the Friday event at The Expo at World Market Center.\nJam, born Nick Rivera Caminero, is male, which Trump acknowledged when the singer known in the Latin community for hits \"Travesuras\" and \"X\" (with J Balvin) came to the stage.\n\"Oh, look, I\u2019m glad he came up,\" Trump said.\nTaylor Swift backs Kamala Harris: Popstar's endorsement sends more than 400,000 visitors to Vote.gov\nDonning a red \"Make America Great Again\" baseball cap, Jam told Trump it was an honor to meet him.\n\"People that come from where I come from, they don\u2019t meet the president. So, I\u2019m lucky,\" Jam said. \"We need you. We need you back, right? We need you to be the president.\"\nBorn in Massachusetts, Jam grew up in Puerto Rico and is among several reggaeton stars who have endorsed Trump\u2019s candidacy for president, including Anuel AA and Justin Quiles, who joined Trump at his rally in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, in August.\nJam on Saturday seemingly dismissed Trump\u2019s misgendering, posting a photo of the two on Instagram with the caption \"Nicky jam la potra la bichota\" and a string of laughing emojis. The comment translates, loosely, to \"the filly, the big shot,\" the latter a Latin slang term popularized by Colombian singer Karol G in her 2020 song, \"Bichota.\"\nThe campaign of Kamala Harris used the clip of Trump referring to Jam as \"she\u2019s hot\" in a post on X.\nUSA TODAY has reached out to representatives for Jam for comment.\nMan\u00e1 denounces Nicky Jam's Donald Trump endorsement\nJam's endorsement of Trump prompted the Grammy-winning Mexican rock band Man\u00e1 to pull their 2016 collaboration with Jam, \"De Pies a Cabeza\u201d (\"From Head to Toe\"), off the internet.\nThe band explained its decision in an Instagram post Sunday along with the heading, in Spanish, \"we don't work with racists.\"\nThe statement reads: \"For the past 30 years, Man\u00e1 has supported and defended the rights of Latinos around the world. There is no business or promotion that is worth more than the dignity of our people. That is why today Man\u00e1 decided to remove its collaboration with Nicky Jam 'De Pies a Cabeza' from all digital platforms.\"\nJam's support of Trump also received mixed reactions from fans in comments on his Facebook page, with some saying he is \"on the right side of history\" and voting for Trump was \"common sense,\" and others disagreeing with his stance.\n\"What an insult you are to the Latino population,\" reads one comment, while another takes issue with Trump\u2019s ignorance of Jam's background: \"Trump is a user. He just wants the Hispanic people votes. He did not even take a minute to Google who you were because in fact he really doesn't care.\"\nTrump was equally unacquainted with Anuel AA and Quiles during their appearance with him in Pennsylvania.\nAccording to Rolling Stone, Trump introduced the pair by saying, \"Do you know who the hell they are? Come up here fast, fellas, come on, because I don\u2019t think these people know who the hell you are.\" He added: \"But it\u2019s good for the Puerto Rican vote. Every Puerto Rican is going to vote for Trump right now. We\u2019ll take it.\""

      "text": "- Biography\nA true innovator and creative, the composer and singer from the island of Puerto Rico, Jesus Manuel Nieves Cortes, better known as Jhay Cortez, began reaping success at the young age of 16, and yet, this is just the beginning of his promising career.\nBorn in Rio Piedra, Puerto Rico, Jhay lived in New Jersey for most of his childhood. When he was 12 years old, he moved back to Puerto Rico, where he found a new style of music growing in popularity, the new wave of urban music, such as reggaeton, was on the rise. It is at that moment, listening to the songs of Don Omar back in his hometown that Jhay fell in love with this genre, forever changing his future as a singer and song writer.\nSince he was 14 years old he began producing and composing songs, and two years later, his work as composer and producer in the album \u201cInvencible\u201d for Tito el Bambino paid off, winning Jhay his first GRAMMY.\nAchieving such a prestigious award at such a young age was the trampoline that launched his career as a composer, working alongside great artists like Zion y Lennox, Natti Natasha, and Nicky Jam, among others. However, this didn\u2019t stop him from developing his own style and discovering his sound.\nIt is this unique style that is portrayed when he launched his first single, \u201cDonde No Se Vea\u201d (Where You Can\u2019t See It), followed by \u201cSe Supone\u201d (I Suppose) and \u201cEstan Pa\u2019 Mi\u201d (They Are There for Me), allowing him to establish himself as a singer and capturing the attention from the audience.\nEven then, Jhay continued working as a composer and producer, taking home his second GRAMMY in 2018 for \u201cBest Urban Album\u201d for the work he did on J Balvin\u2019s album \u201cVibras\u201d, for which he composed four songs.\nJhay won the Song of the Year award granted by the Composer\u2019s Association (ASCAP), for the single \u201cI Like It\u201d featuring Cardi B and J Balvin. Two more of his songs, \u201cCriminal\u201d and \u201cNo Es Justo\u201d (It\u2019s Not Fair), were also awarded.\nUnder the Universal Latin Music Entertainment label in 2019, Jhay launched his first single \u201cCostear\u201d along with four remixes of the same song. He also released \u201cNo me Conoce\u201d (Doesn\u2019t Know Me) and its remix featuring J Balvin and Bad Bunny, which is the second most watched video globally, and is also on the Top 100 of Billboard\u2019s Hot 100, and one the 25 most listened to songs globally on Spotify.\nHis album, \u201cFamouz\u201d, written entirely by him, and in which he also took part as an executive producer, has made it to the list of Top 10 Latin Albums in the United States."

I just change thoughts and like an hour later, I'm a whole other person,\" Paloma says. \"I was very heavy on the thought of not overthinking the lyrics and not putting so much 'Oh, I have to represent for this type of people.' I was more just on what I feel and how I would want to hear something.\"\nHere are five things to know about Paloma and her latest musical chapter.\nRap superstar Drake influenced Paloma Mami's stage name\nPaloma Mami owes a piece of her artistic origin story to the Champagne Papi himself.\nThe singer\u2019s stage name was inspired, in part, by rap icon Drake and his Instagram username, @champagnepapi.\n\"I always loved the way he writes and his musical production in all his albums,\" Paloma says. \"My favorite album of his is 'Views,' and I feel like when I was younger, that album definitely inspired me a lot to want to make music.\"\nThe Canadian emcee's Grammy-nominated fourth album features the now-iconic R&B jam \"Hotline Bling,\" as well as the dancehall-inflected \"One Dance.\" While Drizzy has sonically evolved with his latest releases, the dance-influenced \"Honestly, Nevermind\" and the hip-hop heavy \"For All the Dogs\" Paloma doesn't rule out a musical link-up someday.\n\"Listen, if he brough back (the) 'Views' era, it would be a dream collaboration,\" Paloma says. \"Now, he's older, he talks about different things. He sounds different, obviously, because you can't always sound the same.\"\nWhy Paloma Mami's Rauw Alejandro collaboration 'La Freak' was written in the stars\nOf all the collaborations on Paloma Mami's new album, one was truly the work of el universo.\nThe singer teamed up with fellow reggaeton star Rauw Alejandro on \"La Freak,\" a steamy hook-up anthem that sees the pair trade raunchy flirtations with blush-worthy rizz. Paloma says she had the \"intuition\" that Alejandro, known for his Casanova persona and NSFW lyrics, would be the perfect collaborator, and a chance conversation proved her right.\n\"He had literally reached out to me and was just asking me about where I was and everything,\" Paloma reflects. \"I was going to where he was, like, a week later. So, I was like, 'Oh my God, I was just thinking about you, and I have this song. I would love for you to be on it.'\"\nPaloma's creative manifestation fully came to life when she and Alejandro met up in New York to work together in the studio.\n\"He was super quick,\" Paloma says. \"He was really cool to watch create. I loved the process. I always love to see how artists make their music, and it was really dope.\"\nPaloma Mami shares the inspiration behind emotional 'Astros' video\nPaloma Mami's newest music video is a coming-of-age of sorts.\nThe visuals for \"Astros,\" a bruising breakup track about an ill-fated love, see Paloma navigate an arctic environment \u2014 including getting trapped inside a block of ice \u2014 as she grieves the loneliness of her heartbreak.\nThe video is also peppered with references to her 2019 hit \"Fing\u00edas,\" an Easter egg that Paloma says was meant to \"pay homage to my younger self and close a cycle.\"\n\"In this environment that I'm in, I kind of froze myself because I was trying to get to somebody else,\" Paloma explains. \"I basically was where I was because I was trying to reach somebody that wasn't reachable, things that happen when you put others before yourself.\"\nWill Paloma Mami go on tour for 'C\u00f3digos de Mu\u00f1eka'?\nPaloma Mami may be coming to a city near you.\nThe singer, who treated fans to a headliner set at Coke Studio at L.A. LIVE on July 25, teases that a concert tour is likely to get on the books for 2026.\n\"I definitely want to be able to plan everything super well for this tour just because I have so much care for the aesthetic of the album,\" says Paloma, whose album campaign is coated in the classic doll color, pink, and the hyper-femininity of magical girl anime.\n\"It's just so detailed, I feel like we have to come up with a really great visual aesthetic to it, so that everybody can kind of feel like they're immersed in the world,\" Paloma adds. \"So, we're just going to work on how to do that for now.\"\nPaloma Mami looks back on Major Lazer hit 'QueLoQue'\nPaloma Mami was courted by music royalty early on in her career, and the experience was \"fire,\" she says.\n2025 marks the five-year anniversary of Paloma's song \"QueLoQue,\" a collaboration with EDM heavyweight Major Lazer that the singer landed before her debut album even dropped.\nThe mambo-infused, hip-hop banger earned the rising star a Top 20 hit on Billboard's Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart and helped her meet Major Lazer frontman and Grammy-winning producer Diplo.\n\"Major Lazer and Diplo had been reaching out to me when I first started everything, too, which was really cool that they were able to recognize sounds just for sounding good,\" Paloma says. \"They're really dope in that area of finding artists who are underground \u2026 I really loved collaborating with them.\""
