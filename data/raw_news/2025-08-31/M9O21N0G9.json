  "title": "8 Propeller Planes Powered By Diesel Engines",
  "description": "Diesel engine planes are not a common sight nowadays, but not too long ago, they were at the cutting edge of long-distance, slow-moving aviation.",
  "content": "Diesel engines are a rarity in aviation history, but they've carved out an interesting niche. While most aircraft rely on gasoline-powered piston engines or jet turbines, diesel has offered some distinct advantages. Better fuel efficiency, the ability to burn widely available jet fuel, and longer endurance made diesel-powered planes attractive to designers searching for range and economy. At the same time, diesel engines tend to be heavier and produce less power for their size, which kept them from becoming mainstream. That said, we can't discount the influence that the myths about diesel engines had on the popularity of those machines. Through the years, several manufacturers experimented with the concept. Some aircraft were built to break records, staying in the air for days at a time without refueling. Others were commercial or military designs adapted to diesel for efficiency on long routes. In recent decades, the rising cost and scarcity of gas has given diesel another chance, this time in general aviation, with companies like Tecnam and Diamond building production models using modern turbo-diesel engines. The result is a mix of machines that tell a story about aviation's search for endurance and economy. From pre-war prototypes to modern four-seaters, diesel aircraft represent both ambition and practicality. Here are some of our favorite diesel-powered propeller planes, why they succeeded, and why others never caught on.\n\nThe Diamond DA42 Twin Star is a four-seat, twin-engine aircraft built by Diamond Aircraft Industries. The aircraft achieved its first flight in 2002 before receiving certification in 2004, after which it became the world's first diesel-powered fixed-wing aircraft to perform a nonstop North Atlantic crossing. Its carbon composite construction gives it strength and durability while offering superior aerodynamics. The DA42 combines low fuel burn with the added safety of two engines, making it one of the most popular modern light twins in the world. The Austro AE300 2.0-liter turbocharged diesel engines power the DA42 with a combined output of 168 horsepower each. The engines operate on Jet-A fuel, which provides better accessibility and lower costs than Avgas throughout numerous regions worldwide. The DA42 achieves smooth flight operations through its combination of MT three-blade constant-speed propellers. The aircraft burns 10.4 gallons per hour at 60% power consumption while maintaining a 175 knots true airspeed, and can travel approximately 1,225 nautical miles before needing refueling. It climbs at more than 1,100 feet per minute under sea level conditions, maintaining a service ceiling of 18,000 feet, while its single-engine ceiling reaches 17,500 feet. Inside, the DA42 features a modern Garmin G1000 NXi glass cockpit with integrated flight control systems, Synthetic Vision, and options like weather radar. The cabin is equipped with ergonomic, climate-controlled seating and multiple interior finish options. Combined with advanced safety systems, TKS de-icing capability, and exceptional visibility through its panoramic canopy, the DA42 stands out as a safe and versatile twin-engine aircraft.\n\nIntroduced in 2015 with Avgas engines, this model gained a significant upgrade when Tecnam added the Continental CD-170, a 170-hp engine running on Jet A or diesel fuel. This move not only cut operating costs but also expanded the aircraft's global appeal. This plane consumes 5.2 gallons per hour during long-range cruise operations while providing flight times exceeding 14 hours and distances beyond 1,000 nautical miles, which surpasses many traditional high-wing aircraft. Cruising speeds typically fall around 132 knots, with a service ceiling of 18,000 feet. Takeoff roll is about 1,250 feet, and it climbs at an average rate of 740 feet per minute. The aircraft's structure blends a carbon-fiber fuselage with metal wings and stabilator, providing strength and safety. Inside, the cabin is spacious, with three passenger doors, ergonomic seating, and electrically height-adjustable 26G crashworthy seats. Avionics come standard with the Garmin G1000 NXi suite and GFC700 autopilot. Priced between $412,000 and $550,000 depending on configuration, the P2010 TDI delivers global fuel compatibility and long-legged performance in a stylish package, proving that yes, airplanes can run on diesel fuel.\n\nThe Mooney M10 series marked a major shift for the company when it was unveiled in 2014, introducing two new diesel-powered aircraft: the M10T and M10J. Both were built with all-composite airframes and retained Mooney's distinctive forward-swept tail, but they were designed for different roles. The M10T is aimed squarely at the flight training market. It comes with a fixed gear, a Continental CD-135 diesel engine producing 135 horsepower, and Garmin's G1000 glass cockpit. With seating for two and an optional third seat, it's a modern and technically advanced trainer that consumes as little as 4 to 5.3 gallons of fuel per hour. Cruise speeds are expected to be around 140 knots, with a maximum of 160 knots, and roughly 500 nautical miles of range. The M10J, on the other hand, is designed for performance-oriented pilots. Using a 155-horsepower CD-155 engine and retractable landing gear, it offers speeds up to 180 knots and a maximum range of about 900 nautical miles. Like the M10T, it features sidestick controls, a single-lever FADEC power system, and Garmin's G1000 avionics, while adding the GFC 700 autopilot. While still a two-seater at its core, buyers can opt for a third seat or use the extra cabin space for cargo. Both models highlight Mooney's return to innovation after restructuring, with an emphasis on global markets such as China. The M10 series represented a middle ground between efficient training aircraft and Mooney's high-performance M20 lineup, which are some of the cheapest planes you can buy today.\n\nThe Junkers Ju-86 started as a twin-engine medium bomber in the mid-1930s, but its most notable role came later as a high-altitude reconnaissance and bomber platform powered by diesel engines. Early versions used the 600-horsepower Jumo 205 diesel, which promised efficiency but struggled with reliability and power-to-weight ratios. In Spain, the Ju-86 underperformed, and by the start of World War II, most had been reassigned to training. Junkers, however, saw potential in pairing the airframe with a pressurized cockpit and more advanced diesels, leading to the Ju-86P and later the Ju-86R. These versions carried supercharged Jumo 207 engines, eventually fitted with nitrous oxide injection and four-blade propellers to hold performance at extreme altitudes. The Ju-86P introduced the first operational pressurized cockpit, seating two crew and maintaining cabin conditions equivalent to 10,000 feet. With extended wings, the aircraft could climb above 40,000 feet, well beyond the reach of standard RAF Spitfires. The reconnaissance P-2 model operated unarmed, while the P-1 carried a modest bomb load. Both flew slowly (about 186 mph at altitude) but relied on height as their defense. The improved Ju-86R stretched wings to 105 feet and could operate at 47,000 feet, making it one of the highest-flying aircraft of the war. Operationally, Ju-86s flew nuisance raids over Britain between 1940 and 1942, and gathered intelligence over North Africa during the battles around El Alamein. RAF efforts to counter them led to modified Spitfires stripped for ceiling performance. In September 1942, one such Spitfire, flown by Pilot Officer Emanuel Galitzine, engaged a Ju-86R in what became the highest recorded dogfight of WWII.\n\nThe Blohm and Voss BV 138 \"Seedrache\" was the Luftwaffe's main long-range maritime patrol flying boat during World War II. Entering service in 1940, it was produced in 297 units through 1943 and quickly earned the nickname \"Flying Clog\" due to its short, chunky hull. Designed by Richard Vogt, the aircraft had an unconventional layout with a trimotor setup, a twin-boom tail, and a compact hull-fuselage that doubled as its float structure. While plagued by delays and redesigns early on, the BV 138 became a versatile workhorse for reconnaissance and mine-clearing roles across Europe's coastal battlefields. Early versions used Junkers Jumo 205 diesel engines, a rare choice in aviation but practical for naval use, since they allowed refueling at sea from U-boats. The definitive BV 138C-1 adopted the improved Jumo 205D and a four-blade propeller for the center engine, addressing vibration and overheating problems. Its range reached over 4,000 km on ferry flights, though normal missions averaged around five hours. Performance was modest, with a top speed of 177 mph and a ceiling of just 16,000 feet, but endurance and ruggedness mattered more for patrol duties. Armament included 20mm cannons in nose and tail turrets and machine guns mounted in the central nacelle. Six hardpoints carried bombs or depth charges, making it capable of anti-submarine patrols. A special BV 138MS variant carried a large electromagnetic ring to detonate naval mines. The aircraft saw service in Norway, the Atlantic, and the Mediterranean, often operating in coordination with U-boats. Despite its slow speed, the Seedrache became Blohm and Voss's most-produced wartime design.\n\nThe Stinson SM-1DX Detroiter stands as the first heavier-than-air aircraft to achieve flight using a diesel engine in aviation history. NX7654 took flight from the Packard proving grounds in Utica, Michigan, on September 18, 1928. An experimental Packard DR-980 nine-cylinder air-cooled radial diesel engine powered the aircraft during its flight, with test pilots Walter E. Lees and L.M. Woolson at the controls. The engine reached 225 horsepower at 1,950 rpm, demonstrating that compression-ignition powerplants could work in aviation applications. The SM-1DX itself was based on the successful Stinson Detroiter monoplane design introduced in 1927. With a wingspan of just under 46 feet, a gross weight of about 3,485 pounds, and a top speed of 122 mph, the aircraft was already favored by airlines such as Northwest and Braniff for its enclosed cabin and comfortable seating. What made the SM-1DX stand out was its role as a testbed for Packard's diesel engine program. Although the diesel-powered Detroiter demonstrated greater fuel efficiency compared to gasoline engines of the day, problems soon became apparent. Exhaust fumes and excessive vibration limited its potential. Despite these drawbacks, the experiment proved that diesel engines could extend range and endurance. A later version of the same Packard diesel engine set a world endurance record in 1931 by flying 84 hours and 33 minutes nonstop in a Bellanca aircraft. While diesel never became mainstream, the Stinson SM-1DX's 1928 flight was a groundbreaking moment that showcased innovation during the Golden Age of Aviation.\n\nThe Blohm and Voss Ha 139 served as a German floatplane with four engines, which Lufthansa developed for its transatlantic mail operations during the mid-1930s. The aircraft needed to transport more than 1,100 pounds of cargo while flying 3,100 miles at 155 mph and perform both ship catapult launches and rough water landings. The shipbuilding company Blohm and Voss created an innovative floatplane with inverted gull wings and steel wing spar fuel storage. Unlike a flying boat, it relied on large floats for buoyancy rather than its fuselage. The first prototype, the Ha 139 V1 \"Nordwind,\" flew in late 1936, followed by the V2 \"Nordmeer\" in 1937. These aircraft operated on trial routes between New York and the Azores, demonstrating long-distance capability but also revealing stability and engine cooling issues. A third prototype, the V3 \"Nordstern,\" introduced in 1938, was larger and heavier with updated Junckers Jumo 205C six-cylinder diesel engines. All three aircraft eventually entered Lufthansa service on routes linking Germany with Brazil and Africa, making the Ha 139 one of the largest floatplanes of its time. The outbreak of World War II ended the plane's civilian career. The Luftwaffe pressed the Ha 139 into service as a troop transporter, a reconnaissance aircraft, and even a minesweeper, with one version fitted with a magnetic ring to detonate naval mines. However, since it was not designed for military operations, the Ha 139 suffered from a lack of spare parts. Plans for a bomber version went nowhere, though its airframe inspired the related Ha 142 landplane. Ultimately, only three Ha 139 were built, leaving it as an experimental but short-lived link between commercial innovation and wartime necessity.",

      "text": "Can Airplane Engines Run On Diesel Fuel?\nJust as with the automotive industry, there are a variety of aircraft engines designed to run on various types of fuels. Even electric planes are something we're likely to see more of in the future. But what about diesel? It's common in trucks and other powerful, often cargo-hauling vehicles, so it would make sense for airplanes too, right?\nThe answer is a touch complicated. Factors like burn rates, operating temperatures, and other fuel performance details are important when it comes to all engines and it's no exception for aircraft. In fact, due to the nature of air travel and distribution, these considerations can be considerably more important.\nUltimately, yes, airplane engines can run on diesel fuel. With a very large metaphorical asterisk next to that statement. Much like it's not a great idea to put diesel into a regular gas-powered car, aircraft engines are built with particular kinds of fuel in mind, and that includes diesel \u2014 or something other than diesel.\nDiesel in airplanes\nThe thing is, diesel aircraft engines can run on diesel fuel, because that's what they were designed to do. One of the most popular single-engine planes, the Piper PA-28, offers a diesel-powered model. And as Flying Magazine points out, diesel airplane engines also tend to be more economical and fuel efficient than their Jet-A (basically consumer-grade jet fuel) counterparts.\nIt's just that the general aviation (GA) market in the U.S. has been sticking primarily with low-lead avgas (aviation fuel for smaller airplanes) or Jet-A engines instead. There are some GA aircraft that can accept diesel and are also certified by the FAA \u2014 like the Tecnam P2010 TDI \u2014 but they're currently not the majority.\nSo while there are diesel airplanes out there, they're still not as prevalent in the U.S. as non-diesel options yet. Also, while there might arguably be some wiggle room for diesel in GA aircraft, BP strongly recommends not using it as a substitute for jet fuel unless the aircraft is specifically built to allow for it, like that Tecnam P2010 TDI.\nWhat happens if you use diesel, regardless?\nBefore we continue, a reminder: Whether you're driving a car or piloting an airplane it is never a good idea to use any kind of fuel other than what is recommended (or required) by the manufacturer. Using incompatible fuel can often, at best, result in reduced engine performance. At worst, it may damage the engine outright \u2014 and you do not want that happening when you're on the road or in the air.\nIf, hypothetically, diesel was used in an aircraft engine that wasn't built for it, weight would be one of the first issues. Despite being more efficient, diesel is heavier, and, depending on the amount used, could reduce the overall payload capacity by over 100 pounds.\nDiesel is also more susceptible to colder temperatures, which is usually mitigated with a mixture of additives but said additives aren't always going to be mixed in based on the time of year, local markets, what refinery produced it, etc. And without those added elements any diesel in the engine could start to freeze at higher altitudes (where temperatures drop dramatically) and create blockages."

      "text": "5 Of The Cheapest Planes You Can Buy Today\nGenerally speaking, people like to get a good deal. They want the price of their purchase to reflect the goods' value, and who can blame them? Although what constitutes \"good value\" remains subjective, price is certainly part of the equation. And while most of us will engage in the purchase of an automobile or a house at some point in our lives, a select few will find themselves shopping for an airplane. Because of that, they might not know which plane models can be a good investment, and how much they should be willing to pay for them.\nYou won't be surprised to hear that airplanes are extraordinarily expensive, with price increasing exponentially with size, power, and payload capacity. For example, the retail price of a Gulfstream 19-passenger private jet hovers around $70 million, which is far outside the reach of all but the uber wealthy. Conversely, the retail price of a 4-passenger Cessna 172 Skyhawk can go up to half a million dollars, depending on the specific model. This option, too, is sadly out of reach for most entry-level pilots.\nFortunately for them, used airplanes can be much cheaper than a new model. And don't worry: Planes are designed, built, and maintained in such a way that lets them fly for decades and remain airworthy. They undergo rigorous tests that make sure they can survive in conditions far more intense than anything that our cars could go through. In most circumstances, you can confidently pilot an aircraft upwards of 75 years old.\nCessna 172\nWith 44,000 units and counting, the Cessna 172 holds the title as the most produced aircraft in the world. Though it has seen many variants and regular upgrades, the basic 1956 design is still in production today, having stopped only for a 10-year hiatus that ended in 1996. Known for being easy to handle and highly durable, the 172 also benefits from an excellent safety record and uncomplicated maintenance with plentiful spare parts availability. Pilots also appreciate the roomy cabin and good visibility from the high mounted wings. In 2015, Bill Cox of Cessna Owner Magazine proclaimed the 172 to be so durable and reliable that you could consider it the aviation equivalent of a Toyota Camry.\nMany pilots learn to fly in a 172, as it is used by flight schools everywhere, so seasoned aviators looking to buy their first aircraft will probably be familiar with this model. This makes it a great entry-level plane for a first-time buyer. Although maintenance costs will always be a factor to consider, a 172 can be picked up for a reasonable sum. At the time of writing, Trade-A-Plane lists a 1960 172A with a recent annual maintenance and complete logs for $49,900 in New Jersey, while Controller has a 1967 model based in Ontario, Canada in similar conditions listed at $55,000. Prices rise sharply for newer models equipped with modern avionics.\nPiper Cherokee\nFollowing WWII, Piper Aircraft continued its wartime growth by offering low-cost fabric-body aircraft like the Cub, a model that was popular with the military during the war, and its successor, the Tri-Pacer. But as the 1950s progressed, Piper needed a more modern aircraft. With preliminary designs being hashed out as early as 1952, Piper's new all-metal plane was finally introduced in late 1960.\nThe Piper Cherokee proved to be an excellent aircraft and enjoyed brisk sales from the start. The company offered different versions of the Lycoming engine, which produced between 140 and 235 horsepower. After a few years, Piper altered the airframe to make space for more powerful engines and increase its payload capacity, first with the Cherokee Six and eventually expanding the design to other aircraft. Although Piper no longer sells the Cherokee, some of its current models, such as the Warrior, the Archer, and the Arrow, are firmly rooted in the original design and can be considered direct descendants of the original.\nPopular with pilots and used widely by flight schools, Cherokees are relatively abundant on the used market and can be obtained for a reasonable price. Although they are known to be reliable, veteran pilot Bill Cox says that the price is the plane's strongest advantage and a good reason to buy one. You can find one for under $50,000, though at this price point, it will likely be showing its age. Meanwhile, a Cherokee that is well-maintained and looks as good as new will push the price up to the $70,000 range.\nAeronca 7AC Champion\nThe Aeronautical Corporation of America, which sold aircraft under the Aeronca name, began manufacturing in the late 1920s, and much like other companies of the era, was called upon to increase production during WWII. Later, in 1945, the company's Model 7AC Champion received certification and became its best-selling model.\nThis tandem two-seat trainer featured a 65-horsepower Continental engine and a low price of $2,095. Although a simple model, it proved to be a capable light airplane that seemed to have no trouble attracting buyers. Nonetheless, production ended in 1951, and the Champion Aircraft company acquired the rights to the Aeronca design. Only when Champion Aircraft merged with Bellanca did the company began producing an improved version of the original, which came out of the factory floor in 1971. It now carries the name of Champion Citabria.\nToday, the Aeronca offers great value at an affordable cost, with prices occasionally dipping below $40,000. Aviation Consumer notes that, while age can make sourcing parts a bit tricky, you won't need to replace them often, and that the overall cost of ownership is as cheap as it gets for any aircraft, even an ultralight. With some extensive research, you should even be able to uncover a flight-worthy model for under $30,000. This is a tempting offer, prompting a dilemma of whether one should buy a swift and fun-driving 200-horsepower 2025 Honda Civic Si or get the Aeronca and fly over traffic instead.\nMooney M20\nLike many small aircraft companies, Mooney was founded in the 1920s. Through some ups and downs, the company persevered until it had its first success with the Mooney M-18 Mite, often called the Texas Messerschmidt for its resemblance to the German BF-109 of WWII. This success gave founder Al Mooney the opportunity to develop the kind of plane he had wanted to make for years.\nIn 1953, the Mooney M20 officially took flight, leading the company to eventually become the fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, right behind Cessna, Beechcraft, and Piper. The success of the M20 ultimately came from its speed and efficiency, with later variants providing continuous upgrades and innovations. This is likely why a Mooney M20K was chosen to carry the aircraft engine based on Porsche's legendary 911 flat-six, the PFM 3200.\nToday, Mooney owners are known to love their planes much in the way VW owners are loyal or how some gearheads can tell you every detail about the AMC Gremlin. Furthermore, seasoned pilots note that a Mooney can feel tricky to fly at first, but once you have a feel for it, the handling characteristics are superb. Fortunately for those fans, Mooney airplanes are not overpriced. A few of them are listed for around $30,000, but if we bring our budget to the $60,000 range we find a much wider array of options. At this price range, we can find plenty of airworthy Mooney M20s from just about anywhere in the U.S. Additionally, while Mooney rarely builds new models, the company remains dedicated to supporting its existing aircraft even today.\nUltralight\nAlthough it's a class of aircraft and not a specific model, we have to mention ultralights. Those planes can be an incredibly cheap and easy entry into aviation, giving you the opportunity to wet your feet before jumping into proper aircraft ownership. Being a small and lightweight aircraft, ultralights come with several restrictions, some of which apply to the pilot and some to the vehicle.\nAccording to FAA regulations, an ultralight must carry a single occupant and be dedicated entirely to recreational use. It must weigh less than 254 pounds, carrying less than five gallons of fuel, and have a max speed of less than 55 knots. There are a few other rules concerning this type of aircraft, but more important is the lack of a specific rule: no license is required to fly one. This is a category of aircraft dedicated purely to amateurs and hobbyists, and it can be quite fun.\nUltralights come in a few forms, including small, fixed wing aircraft, powered parachutes, gliders, and rotorcraft. While you may encounter a light sport aircraft that looks similar to an ultralight, those generally weigh more than 254 pounds and can often carry a passenger, and so require FAA licensing. For those wanting to jump head first into simple aviation, you can find ultralights pretty much everywhere for less than $5,000. You might even find a good model on sale for less than $1,000, if you are willing to put in some work. There isn't much room for debate: If you are dying to take to the skies and don't have that much time or money, the solution is an ultralight."

With its four engines it was at the time one of the largest float-equipped seaplanes that had been built. The inboard engines were mounted at the joint between the inboard anhedral and outboard dihedral wing sections, above the pylon-mounted floats.\nThe aircraft were flown by Deutsche Luft Hansa (DHL) on transatlantic routes between 1937 and 1939. Catapult-launched from an aircraft tender they were able to transport 500 kg of mail over a distance of up to 5,000 km.\nOn the outbreak of WW II, the planes were transferred to the Luftwaffe and used for transport, reconnaissance and minesweeping work over the Baltic Sea. They were not particularly suited for military use. After service with DLH, the Ha 139B was modified as the Ha 139B/Umbau (Reconstruction) with an extended glazed nose accommodating a navigator and a spherical Ikaria mount for a machine-gun. Further machine guns were mounted in the cockpit roof hatch and in lateral mountings on either side of the rear fuselage. The Ha 139B/Umbau was later modified into a mine sweeping (Minensuch) aircraft Ha 139B/MS fitted with a large magnetic sensing loop strung between the nose, floats, wing-tips, and tail unit.\nFurther development of the Ha 139 led to the land based version Blohm & Voss Bv 142 which had its first flight in October 1938 (Ref.: 24)."

      "text": "10 Diesel Engine Myths You Need To Stop Believing\nWhen it's time to buy a new vehicle, you may find yourself at a crossroads wondering whether to go with a standard gasoline engine or a spiffy diesel variant. Diesel engines are known far and wide for providing superb acceleration and towing potential. But that only scratches the surface, and there are many other things you might not know about diesel engines worth learning about. Of course, for every true fact out there, there's a ton of misinformation and straight-up diesel myths that have persisted about this technology.\nIt's easy enough for a myth to spread. Sometimes, someone will get faulty information from a source and then tell it to everyone they know. Certain details about diesel engines were true years ago, but the technology has since come a long way to where it's no longer really a problem.\nEither way, it's good to cut through the treacle so you can make an informed decision. There are definitely pros and cons to diesel engines, similar to gasoline ones, so it's paramount to do as much research as possible to wind up with the perfect vehicle for your needs. Let's look at some of the stuff that's straight-up untrue.\nMore expensive to maintain\nMoney will always be a major factor when considering what type of vehicle to get. Diesel automatically loses some points in this department, as they tend to carry a higher upfront cost compared to gas. In general, a person can expect to spend anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000 more on a diesel truck than a gas one. There will naturally be other costs to consider in the long run, with many people online talking about how diesel engines ultimately cost more to maintain. However, there's a larger picture worth looking at.\nWhile individual replacements and repairs tend to cost more with diesel engines, you generally don't need to take it to a mechanic as often as a gas engine. This is thanks largely due to diesel engines having fewer components compared to gas. For example, diesel engines don't rely on spark plugs to ignite fuel. Instead, they ignite diesel by compressing a combination of air and fuel.\nPlus, there's also the matter of longevity. While other factors play a part, many gas engines typically tap out around 200,000 miles. Diesel engines can often go anywhere between 300,000 miles and 1,000,000 miles. As long as you follow some essential diesel engine maintenance tips, it might be a while until you spend a ton of money upfront again on a brand new vehicle.\nDiesel engines are loud and dirty\nThis diesel myth actually used to be true. Years ago, diesel engines would emit more soot and harmful pollutants like nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. When people have images in their heads of massive trucks billowing black clouds behind them, they're probably thinking of diesel engines from the past. Fortunately, great strides have been made to vastly reduce the output from these engines to pretty much put them on par with gasoline engines.\nThe Energy Policy Act of 2005 led to the development of the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act Program. This opened the door for greater funding in producing cleaner diesel technology, such as the addition of a diesel particulate filter, which captures particulate matter before entering the local environment. Nick Molden, chief executive of Emissions Analytics, told BBC, \"The filters clean up 99% of the particles. So long as they are not tampered with, they are very effective.\"\nThe general rule of thumb is that if a diesel engine was made after 2007, it likely has these newer standards. And with continued research and development, diesel engines are likely only going to get better as the years go on.\nDiesel is hard to find\nGas stations are everywhere, but not all of them carry diesel. This is a specialized fuel you must use to fill up your vehicle if it has a diesel engine. If regular gas gets into your diesel engine, you need to follow some strict steps to circumvent catastrophic damage. Even outside of that, some people may worry about finding diesel when they're running low on fuel. For the most part, this fear is unfounded.\nYou may not find diesel everywhere, but it's certainly plentiful. For instance, the number of retail fuel stations in California that offer diesel has steadily increased over the last decade (not accounting for a slight dip from 2020 to 2021). As of 2023, there were 5,511 diesel locations across the state. And if you live in a major metropolitan area, you probably won't have any issues finding at least one station near you that provides diesel. Considering that most big rigs use diesel engines, stations should also have it along interstates.\nDiesel technology isn't going away, and many locations have realized the importance of offering different fuels for drivers. Additionally, since diesel engines offer greater fuel economy, you're able to go longer between fill-ups, so you have a bit more of a cushion to finding something suitable.\nDiesel engines are less powerful\nGiven how vehicles with diesel engines generally cost more than gas, it's no wonder that a few perks should come your way. Some of those benefits include greater power, torque, and fuel economy.\nThe reason why diesel engines have more torque than gas cars comes down to the higher compression ratio. Diesel fuel comes with about 11% more energy than gasoline. The combustion chamber is capable of getting a higher level of heat, which ignites the fuel, allowing drivers to haul heavier loads without needing to worry as much about slowing down. As mentioned earlier, big rigs usually have diesel engines for precisely this reason.\nThe turbocharger is also essential for getting the most out of a diesel engine. This is what compresses the air before it gets into the chamber, and while they don't come with every engine, many modern cars and trucks feature them now. In addition to boosting the overall power, turbochargers also help with fuel economy, another major perk when it comes to carrying heavy items across long distances.\nFord owns Cummins engines\nIt's a little odd to see how pervasive the myth that Ford owns Cummins engines continues to be. There wasn't even a point in time where Ford owned the company. The closest it came was in 1990 when Ford acquired 10.8% of the capital shares in Cummins, which wouldn't have been enough to make Ford a majority shareholder. All it did was give Ford a spot on the board of directors.\nThroughout the '90s, Ford's F650 and F750 lines of trucks came with Cummins engines, which likely got even more people thinking that Ford owned the company outright. However, in 1997, Cummins purchased back all of Ford's stock in the company, resulting in a total divestment. This was advantageous for Ford, too, as it helped bring its total costs down, and prompted the company to start making its trucks' engines in-house.\nFord may have had a partnership with Cummins in the past, but it never owned it. Cummins still produces plenty of powerful diesel engines, and if one wants to get a Cummins product in their Ford truck, there are ways to retrofit it.\nDiesel engines struggle to start in the winter\nA modern myth that just won't go away is that you need to warm up any car before driving off in the winter. In fact, you may even do more harm than good by allowing your vehicle to idle for several minutes, as it could actually increase the amount of friction within the engine's components. This myth exists for diesel cars, too. They may experience a little more pushback in colder months compared to their gas counterparts due to the need to create high temperatures through compression. Getting to those higher temperatures is inherently tougher when it's colder out, but it shouldn't really necessitate idling a car for an extended period of time since diesel vehicles generally come with block heaters.\nA block heater is a component that keeps specific engine parts slightly warm even when it's not moving. This means the engine won't inherently be as cold as the outside temperature, allowing you to start your vehicle and getting it to those higher compressions faster. It's particularly useful if you plan on hauling heavy items in frigid weather. Such loads put even more strain on the engine, necessitating those higher temperatures to get it running optimally.\nIn the event you don't have a block heater already, it's simple enough to purchase a kit. You'll need to plug it in and keep it that way for a few hours before you plan on driving. It requires some foresight, but if you live in an area that gets extremely cold in the winter, it's a must-have.\nIsuzu makes the Duramax diesel engine\nDebunking the myth that Ford owns Cummins engines is pretty easy, but we have to go a bit more into the weeds to analyze Isuzu's partnership with the Duramax diesel engine. We need to go back to Duramax's roots in 1998. Beginning as a joint venture to develop a more powerful diesel engine, DMAX Ltd. was initially co-owned by Isuzu (with a 60% share) and General Motors (with the remaining 40%).\nThis is likely where the myth comes from, and while it was true decades ago, the dynamic of ownership has altered. Eventually, the numbers reversed to where General Motors owned 60% and Isuzu had 40%. In 2022, Isuzu sold off its remaining shares, meaning General Motors currently owns the entirety of DMAX Ltd.\nIsuzu still partners in making diesel engines elsewhere. It actually worked with Cummins going back to 2019, and in May 2024, it was announced the two organizations would produce a new 6.7-liter engine to go in Isuzu trucks. Isuzu chairman and representative director Masanori Katayama said this of the venture in a press release: \"Isuzu and Cummins leadership has established strong mutual trust and respect of each other since the first day of our partnership. I am confident that our strategic partnership will continue and expand over future generations of respective leadership.\"\nVegetable oil works as diesel fuel\nYou should know never to put regular gasoline into a diesel engine, but there's a myth about how vegetable oil could function as a suitable substitute. While it is true that certain biodiesels, in an effort to reduce emissions, contain vegetable oils, you shouldn't just pour a bottle of Crisco directly into your car.\nThere are numerous other components to genuine biodiesel that make it suitable for a vehicle's operation. Studies have been done to determine the impact of using vegetable oil for diesel engines only to find that it can drastically reduce the lifespan of said engine. The United States Department of Energy even put out a report to debunk this diesel myth, asserting, \"Compared to No. 2 diesel fuel, all of the vegetable oils are much more viscous, are much more reactive to oxygen, and have higher cloud point and pour point temperatures.\"\nThe report continues to say that vegetable oil may be fine for short-term use, but there's also the matter that improperly using vegetable oil as fuel is illegal. The Environment Protection Agency has stated how drivers shouldn't use anything to fill up their vehicles that doesn't contain EPA certification. There may be hope in the future to start using unique substances to power vehicles to lessen the population's dependence on traditional fuel, but more work is needed.\nDiesel engines work worse at higher altitudes\nGasoline-powered vehicles can have a harder time working at maximum efficiency at higher altitudes. This is due to the fact gas cars require a specific ratio of air to fuel. Since the air becomes less dense the higher up you go, certain vehicles may struggle. This may naturally lead some to believe that diesel engines have the same problem. In actuality, diesel-powered trucks tend to work just fine as you venture into the mountains.\nOf course, there are numerous factors that can impact performance at higher altitudes, so nothing is an absolute given, but diesel trucks are better equipped for such areas. Turbochargers help immensely in the mountains, as they more easily pull the thinner air into the combustion chamber. It can increase the mass of this lowered quantity of air to increase the odds of the engine running at peak performance.\nWith the proper combination of factors, a diesel vehicle can easily speed up a mountain while most of the other cars struggle. There could still be a slight decrease in performance compared to what the driver is used to, but diesel trucks are far better equipped for this task than gas.\nIt's fine to idle a diesel engine\nRegardless if you have a diesel or gas engine, there's generally no need to idle for extended periods of time. Sometimes, you can't help it, like if you're stuck at a red light. But outside of those types of situations, it's almost always better to turn the engine off and then turn it back on if you plan on keeping your vehicle in the same spot for a while.\nAs stated previously, there's no need to keep a diesel truck idling during the winter to warm it up. It'll be okay to drive almost immediately. Additionally, a driver doesn't save any money in terms of fuel costs to idle in lieu of stopping and restarting. Idling a heavy-duty truck for one hour burns approximately 0.8 gallons of fuel. That's not even getting into how idling is terrible for the environment, and there could even be local or state laws that prohibit idling in certain circumstances.\nWhether you plan on buying a vehicle with a diesel engine or already have one, it never hurts to learn more about how to get the best possible performance out of your ride. Many of these diesel myths may have started with good intentions, but it's good to separate fact from fiction so that you don't accidentally do something you regret later."
