  "description": "The Connected Economy 100 index had a tough week, losing 4.2% percent across all pillars except \u201ceat.\u201d While the index was down overall due to big drops",
  "content": "The Connected Economy 100 index had a tough week, losing 4.2% percent across all pillars except \u201ceat.\u201d While the index was down overall due to big drops at several companies, including double digits at Xero, iRobot, and United Healthcare, there were some notable highlights. Among them:\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nLendingClub was up 21% for the week on strong earnings. The company\u2019s second-quarter call painted a picture of borrowers who are borrowing more, paying better and sticking around. Personal-loan originations climbed 32% from a year earlier to $2.4 billion, helped by repeat customers who still account for roughly half of the volume. In comparison, the net charge-off ratio for loans held on the bank\u2019s books fell to 3%, about half last year\u2019s level. Strong credit trends let the company boost loan sales and net interest income, driving total revenue up 33% to $248 million and GAAP profit to $38 million. Deposit-gathering also accelerated: LevelUp Savings balances reached $2.7 billion, and the recently launched LevelUp Checking has spurred a six-fold jump in daily account openings, with close to 60% coming from existing borrowers \u2014 evidence that customers are deepening relationships rather than shopping elsewhere.\n\nManagement cited \u201cvery high\u201d marketplace demand for its paper, extending a Blue Owl funding pact and inking a first BlackRock transaction. As Chief Executive Scott Sanborn put it, \u201cWe\u2019re not only consistently beating our competition, but we\u2019re also beating our own expectations\u2026 our data is demonstrating the effectiveness of our underwriting and the resilience of our borrower base.\u201d\n\nCognex also posted strong earnings, leading to a 19% bounce. The maker of machine-vision cameras and AI software that helps factories and warehouses inspect products, track packages and guide robots said second-quarter revenue rose 4% to $249 million \u2014 its fourth straight quarter of organic growth \u2014 while disciplined spending lifted adjusted EBITDA margin to 20.7 %, the best showing in two years. Demand was broad-based: logistics booked a sixth consecutive period of double-digit gains, packaging sales grew mid-single digits on strength in healthcare and fast-moving consumer goods, and consumer-electronics orders stayed robust as device makers retooled overseas supply chains. Free cash flow reached $40 million, pushing 12-month conversion to 130 % of earnings, and management projected up to 9 % sales growth in the current quarter.\n\n\u201cThe momentum we saw in Q1 continued in Q2 with revenue of $249 million increasing 4 % year-on-year\u2026 our sales-force transformation is already generating good results and is an important component of this strategy,\u201d Chief Executive Matthew Moschner told analysts.\n\nCyberArk rounded out the winners for the week. Its strong performance comes from the announcement that Palo Alto Networks, a heavyweight in AI-driven network, cloud and security-operations software, agreed to buy the company, which pioneered privileged-access and identity-security tools, in a cash-and-stock deal worth roughly $25 billion. CyberArk holders will receive $45 in cash and 2.2005 Palo Alto shares for each share they own \u2014 about a 26% premium to the stock\u2019s 10-day average \u2014 and the news sent CyberArk shares sharply higher while positioning Palo Alto to add identity protection as a fourth pillar of its platform strategy. Management pitched the move as the right bet for an AI era that is spawning a boom in machine and agent identities:\n\n\u201cOur market entry strategy has always been to enter categories at their inflection point, and we believe that moment for Identity Security is now,\u201d Palo Alto Chief Executive Nikesh Arora said, calling CyberArk \u201cthe definitive leader\u201d in the niche. CyberArk founder Udi Mokady framed the tie-up as an acceleration of his company\u2019s two-decade mission, saying the combination \u201cwill bring unmatched expertise across human and machine identities, privileged access, and AI-driven innovation to secure what\u2019s next.\u201d",

  "summary": "The Connected Economy 100 index experienced a 4.2% decline in all major sectors, including LendingClub, Xero, iRobot, and United Healthcare. Despite these losses, LendingClot rose 21% due to strong Q2 earnings. The company's personal-loan originations increased 32% from a year earlier to $2.4 billion, and the net charge-off ratio for loans held on its books fell to 3%, about half the previous year's level. Cognex also saw a 19% bounce after reporting strong earnings and strong customer demand. CyberArk was also a standout performer due to the announcement of Palo Alto Networks' acquisition of the company, which pioneered privileged-access and identity-security tools, in a cash-and-stock deal worth roughly $25 billion.

LendingClub has used, and intends to use, its investor relations website, X (formerly Twitter) handles (@LendingClub and @LendingClubIR) and Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/LendingClubTeam) as a means of disclosing material non-public information and to comply with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.\nContacts\nFor Investors:\n[email protected]\nMedia Contact:\n[email protected]\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: Pre-Provision Net Revenue (PPNR), Tangible Book Value (TBV) Per Common Share, and Return on Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE). Our non-GAAP financial measures do have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results under GAAP.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide management and investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and enable comparison of our financial results with other public companies.\nWe believe PPNR is an important measure because it reflects the financial performance of our business operations. PPNR is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by subtracting the provision for credit losses and income tax benefit/expense from net income.\nWe believe TBV Per Common Share is an important measure used to evaluate the company's use of equity. TBV Per Common Share is a non-GAAP financial measure representing tangible common equity (common equity reduced by goodwill and customer relationship intangible assets), divided by the ending number of common shares issued and outstanding.\nWe believe ROTCE is an important measure because it reflects the company's ability to generate income from its core assets. ROTCE is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by dividing annualized net income by the average tangible common equity for the applicable period.\nFor a reconciliation of such measures to the nearest GAAP measures, please refer to the tables on pages 13 and 14 of this release.\nWe do not provide a reconciliation of forward-looking Pre-Provision Net Revenue and Return on Tangible Common Equity to the most directly comparable GAAP reported financial measures on a forward-looking basis because we are unable to predict future provision expense and goodwill, respectively, with reasonable certainty without unreasonable effort.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nSome of the statements above, including statements regarding long-term loan funding and anticipated future performance and financial results, are \"forward-looking statements.\" The words \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"outlook,\" \"plan,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"will,\" \"would\" and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements include: our loan performance, our ability to continue to attract and retain new and existing borrowers and marketplace investors (including retaining long-term investors through the duration of their expected partnership and achieving the anticipated level of loan or Structured Certificates program purchases); competition; overall economic conditions; the interest rate environment; the regulatory environment; default rates and those factors set forth in the section titled \"Risk Factors\" in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in forward-looking statements. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nLENDINGCLUB CORPORATION |\n||||||||||||||\nOPERATING HIGHLIGHTS |\n||||||||||||||\n(In thousands, except percentages or as noted) |\n||||||||||||||\n(Unaudited) |\n||||||||||||||\nAs of and for the three months ended |\n% Change |\n|||||||||||||\nJune 30, |\nMarch 31, |\nDecember 31, 2024 |\nSeptember 30, 2024 |\nJune 30, |\nQ/Q |\nY/Y |\n||||||||\nOperating Highlights: |\n||||||||||||||\nNon-interest income |\n$ 94,186 |\n$ 67,754 |\n$ 74,817 |\n$ 61,640 |\n$ 58,713 |\n39 % |\n60 % |\n|||||||\nNet interest income |\n154,249 |\n149,957 |\n142,384 |\n140,241 |\n128,528 |\n3 % |\n20 % |\n|||||||\nTotal net revenue |\n248,435 |\n217,711 |\n217,201 |\n201,881 |\n187,241 |\n14 % |\n33 % |\n|||||||\nNon-interest expense |\n154,718 |\n143,867 |\n142,855 |\n136,332 |\n132,258 |\n8 % |\n17 % |\n|||||||\nPre-provision net revenue(1) |\n93,717 |\n73,844 |\n74,346 |\n65,549 |\n54,983 |\n27 % |\n70 % |\n|||||||\nProvision for credit losses |\n39,733 |\n58,149 |\n63,238 |\n47,541 |\n35,561 |\n(32) % |\n12 % |\n|||||||\nIncome before income tax expense |\n53,984 |\n15,695 |\n11,108 |\n18,008 |\n19,422 |\n244 % |\n178 % |\n|||||||\nIncome tax expense |\n(15,806) |\n(4,024) |\n(1,388) |\n(3,551) |\n(4,519) |\n293 % |\n250 % |\n|||||||\nNet income |\n$ 38,178 |\n$ 11,671 |\n$ 9,720 |\n$ 14,457 |\n$ 14,903 |\n227 % |\n156 % |\n|||||||\nBasic EPS |\n$ 0.33 |\n$ 0.10 |\n$ 0.09 |\n$ 0.13 |\n$ 0.13 |\n230 % |\n154 % |\n|||||||\nDiluted EPS |\n$ 0.33 |\n$ 0.10 |\n$ 0.08 |\n$ 0.13 |\n$ 0.13 |\n230 % |\n154 % |\n|||||||\nLendingClub Corporation Performance Metrics: |\n||||||||||||||\nNet interest margin |\n6.14 % |\n5.97 % |\n5.42 % |\n5.63 % |\n5.75 % |\n|||||||||\nEfficiency ratio(2) |\n62.3 % |\n66.1 % |\n65.8 % |\n67.5 % |\n70.6 % |\n|||||||||\nReturn on average equity (ROE)(3) |\n11.1 % |\n3.5 % |\n2.9 % |\n4.4 % |\n4.7 % |\n|||||||||\nReturn on tangible common equity (ROTCE)(1)(4) |\n11.8 % |\n3.7 % |\n3.1 % |\n4.7 % |\n5.1 % |\n|||||||||\nReturn on average total assets (ROA)(5) |\n1.5 % |\n0.4 % |\n0.4 % |\n0.6 % |\n0.6 % |\n|||||||||\nMarketing expense as a % of loan originations |\n1.40 % |\n1.47 % |\n1.27 % |\n1.37 % |\n1.47 % |\n|||||||||\nLendingClub Corporation Capital Metrics: |\n||||||||||||||\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital ratio |\n17.5 % |\n17.8 % |\n17.3 % |\n15.9 % |\n17.9 % |\n|||||||||\nTier 1 leverage ratio |\n12.2 % |\n11.7 % |\n11.0 % |\n11.3 % |\n12.1 % |\n|||||||||\nBook value per common share |\n$ 12.25 |\n$ 11.95 |\n$ 11.83 |\n$ 11.95 |\n$ 11.52 |\n3 % |\n6 % |\n|||||||\nTangible book value per common share(1) |\n$ 11.53 |\n$ 11.22 |\n$ 11.09 |\n$ 11.19 |\n$ 10.75 |\n3 % |\n7 % |\n|||||||\nLoan Originations (in millions)(6): |\n||||||||||||||\nTotal loan originations |\n$ 2,391 |\n$ 1,989 |\n$ 1,846 |\n$ 1,913 |\n$ 1,813 |\n20 % |\n32 % |\n|||||||\nMarketplace loans |\n$ 1,702 |\n$ 1,314 |\n$ 1,241 |\n$ 1,403 |\n$ 1,477 |\n30 % |\n15 % |\n|||||||\nLoan originations held for investment |\n$ 689 |\n$ 675 |\n$ 605 |\n$ 510 |\n$ 336 |\n2 % |\n105 % |\n|||||||\nLoan originations held for investment as a % of total loan originations |\n29 % |\n34 % |\n33 % |\n27 % |\n19 % |\n|||||||||\nServicing Portfolio AUM (in millions)(7): |\n||||||||||||||\nTotal servicing portfolio |\n$ 12,524 |\n$ 12,241 |\n$ 12,371 |\n$ 12,674 |\n$ 12,999 |\n2 % |\n(4) % |\n|||||||\nLoans serviced for others |\n$ 7,185 |\n$ 7,130 |\n$ 7,207 |\n$ 7,028 |\n$ 8,337 |\n1 % |\n(14) % |\n(1) |\nRepresents a non-GAAP financial measure.

      "text": "Will Create the End-to-End Security Platform for the AI Era\nNEWS SUMMARY:\n- Will accelerate Palo Alto Networks' platform strategy by establishing Identity Security as a new core platform.\n- CyberArk extends Identity Security to all users by advancing the vision that every identity, human, machine and AI requires deep security for access across the modern enterprise.\n- Will deliver Identity Security for agentic AI to secure the new wave of autonomous AI agents by providing foundational controls for this emerging class of privileged identities.\n- Will provide customers with the optimal combination of best of breed technology and integrated platforms to deliver near real-time security outcomes.\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. and NEWTON, Mass., July 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Palo Alto Networks\u00ae (NASDAQ: PANW), the global cybersecurity leader, and CyberArk (NASDAQ: CYBR), the global leader in Identity Security, today announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Palo Alto Networks will acquire CyberArk. Under the terms of the agreement, CyberArk shareholders will receive $45.00 in cash and 2.2005 shares of Palo Alto Networks common stock for each CyberArk share. This represents an equity value of approximately $25 billion for CyberArk and a 26% premium to the unaffected 10-day average of the daily VWAPs of CyberArk as of Friday, July 25, 20251.\nThis strategic combination will mark Palo Alto Networks' formal entry into Identity Security, establishing it as a core pillar of the company's multi-platform strategy. Combining CyberArk's long-standing leadership in Identity Security and Privileged Access Management (PAM) with Palo Alto Networks' comprehensive AI-powered security platforms will extend privileged identity protection to all identity types including human, machine, and the new wave of autonomous AI agents. CyberArk is already establishing itself as an Identity Security platform, and Palo Alto Networks will help accelerate this journey towards platformization to drive better combined security outcomes for customers.\nNikesh Arora, Chairman and CEO of Palo Alto Networks, said:\n\"Our market entry strategy has always been to enter categories at their inflection point, and we believe that moment for Identity Security is now. This strategy has guided our evolution from a next-gen firewall company into a multi-platform cybersecurity leader. Today, the rise of AI and the explosion of machine identities have made it clear that the future of security must be built on the vision that every identity requires the right level of privilege controls, not the 'IAM fallacy'. CyberArk is the definitive leader in Identity Security with durable, foundational technology that is essential for securing the AI era. Together, we will define the next chapter of cybersecurity.\"\nUdi Mokady, Founder and Executive Chairman of CyberArk, said:\n\"This is a profound moment in CyberArk's journey. From the beginning, we set out to protect the world's most critical assets, with a relentless focus on innovation, trust, and security. Joining forces with Palo Alto Networks is a powerful next chapter, built on shared values and a deep commitment to solving the toughest identity challenges. Together, we'll bring unmatched expertise across human and machine identities, privileged access, and AI-driven innovation to secure what's next. This is more than a combination of technologies\u2014it's an acceleration of the mission we began over two decades ago. I'm incredibly proud of what our team has built and deeply grateful to everyone who made this milestone possible.\"\nIdentity and security are converging, highlighting the need for a true Identity Security platform. Securing privileged credentials for both human and machine identities\u2014including AI agents and workloads\u2014is the most critical challenge for the modern enterprise. The integration of CyberArk's Identity Security Platform with Palo Alto Networks will provide many critical benefits:\n- Accelerates the Platform Strategy: The combined platform will provide a single, unified solution designed to help eliminate dangerous security gaps and simplify operations. CyberArk's capabilities will be deeply integrated into Palo Alto Networks' Strata\u2122 and Cortex\u00ae platforms, leveraging AI to deliver identity-aware security and real-time response across the entire enterprise.\n- Disrupts the Legacy IAM Market: This will evolve the legacy IAM market by moving beyond basic hygiene and extending robust, security-first PAM principles to ensure the right level of privilege controls are applied to every identity across the enterprise, whether humans, machines, or agents.\n- Secures Agentic AI: As organizations adopt autonomous Agentic AI, they are deploying the ultimate privileged users. Identity Security is positioned to become the essential framework for securing this new paradigm of the enterprise workforce. Enforcing just-in-time access and least privilege principles ensures that AI agents are granted only the permissions they need, for the exact moment they need them, providing the critical oversight necessary to secure AI-driven automation at scale.\nOnce closed, this acquisition will unite two security leaders with similar values, strong cultures, and talented teams. The combination of the two organizations will offer the industry's most comprehensive and integrated security portfolio, providing customers with a single, trusted vendor for their most critical security needs. The combined companies will become the cyber guardian of our customers, allowing customers to focus on their core business objectives and adopting AI, while we secure their digital future.\nTransaction Details\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Palo Alto Networks intends to acquire CyberArk for $45.00 in cash and 2.2005 shares of Palo Alto Networks common stock for each CyberArk share, which represents a 26% premium to the unaffected 10-day average of the daily VWAPs of CyberArk as of Friday, July 25, 20251. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Palo Alto Networks revenue growth and gross margin. Palo Alto Networks also expects the transaction to be accretive to free cash flow per share in fiscal year 2028 following the first full year of realization of synergies.\nThe transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both Palo Alto Networks and CyberArk, and is expected to close during the second half of Palo Alto Networks' fiscal 2026, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory clearances and approval by CyberArk shareholders.\nFor further information regarding the terms and conditions contained in the definitive agreement, please see Palo Alto Networks' Current Report on Form 8-K and CyberArk's Report on Form 6-K, which will be filed in connection with the transaction.\nAdvisors\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC is acting as financial advisor to Palo Alto Networks, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is acting as legal counsel and Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP is acting as regulatory counsel. Qatalyst Partners is acting as financial advisor to CyberArk and Latham & Watkins LLP and Meitar Law Offices are acting as legal counsel.\nShareholder letter and Investor Call Details\nRead the Palo Alto Networks Shareholder Letter from Chairman and CEO Nikesh Arora.\nBoth organizations look forward to providing additional information on the transaction during an investor presentation at 6:30 am (PT) on July 30, 2025.

Collateral usually is not required.\nYou can use a personal loan for almost any purpose, with a few exceptions. LendingClub Bank members often use personal loans to pay off credit cards at a lower rate, consolidate debt, or take care of unexpected costs.\nA few ways a personal loan from LendingClub Bank cannot be used include anything related to education after high school, making investments (such as securities or cryptocurrency), or funding any illegal activity.\nTo qualify for a personal loan from LendingClub Bank you must be a U.S. citizen or resident and at least 18 years of age with a verifiable bank account. (We accept applications from all U.S. states and Washington, D.C. We do not accept applications from the U.S. territories)\nYour loan application will be evaluated based on several factors, including the information provided by you and the credit bureaus, your credit score, and your ability to repay. For the lowest rates, it helps if you have a higher than average credit score, a low debt-to-income ratio, and a good credit history. Often, applying with another person can help you qualify for a better rate and/or larger loan amount.\nLearn how adding a coborrower can help you get approved for a personal loan.\nYou can apply and complete the entire process online in minutes from the comfort of your home using your phone, laptop, or tablet. Loan approval, and the time it takes to issue a credit decision, are not guaranteed and individual results vary based on creditworthiness and other factors.\nIf your loan is funded, your money will be sent directly to your creditors and/or deposited into your bank account.\nYou can help keep things moving along by checking your to-do list and making sure you have submitted all the documents and information requested.\nChecking your rate from LendingClub Bank has no impact to your credit score because a soft credit pull is used. A hard credit inquiry, which is visible to you and to others, and which may affect a person\u2019s credit score, only appears on the person\u2019s credit report if and when a loan is issued.\nThe good news is that a personal loan could positively impact your credit down the road if you\u2019re able to show a history of on-time payments and a reduction in overall debt (that means no new debt, such as higher credit card balances).\nLearn more about your credit score and how to protect your credit health.\nChoose your offer\nYou\u2019ll be able to select the loan amount, interest rate, APR, monthly payment, and loan term.\nConfirm your information\nWe ask for your Social Security number and details on your income and employment. If we need any other documents or information, we'll let you know in your to-do list. Then, hold tight while we look for your investors on our marketplace and wrap up your loan.\nGet funded\nOnce your loan is approved, we\u2019ll send the money straight to your bank account, and/or pay your creditors directly if you choose this option."
