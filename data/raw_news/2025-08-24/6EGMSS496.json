  "description": "Chinese Taipei's Lin Chin-Tse has legs built to power fastball. They're also a boxer's legs. His father explains.",
  "content": "SOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, PA \u2014 If you wonder why Lin Chin-Tse throws so hard, look at his legs. They\u2019re a pitcher\u2019s legs, built to drive his motion toward the plate and the ball past opponents.\n\n\u201cHe used the physical training part for boxing to train him on the baseball part,\u201d says Kenny Yen, an interpreter who helped assist families of Chinese Taipei\u2019s team at the Little League World Series.\n\nWhat does that entail?\n\n\u201cA lot of running,\u201d he tells Yen to relay to a reporter while flashing a smile. \u201cA lot of cardio.\u201d\n\nLin Shih-Hua, 56, coaches the national boxing team for Tawain, also known as Chinese Taipei. He tried to get his son to follow his footsteps into the ring.\n\n\u201cHe doesn't like boxing,\u201d Lin Shih-Hua says through Yen. \u201cHe likes team sports, so baseball has a lot of teammates. And when it's boxing, he feels by himself. He wants to be a part of a team.\u201d\n\nAfter his son, 12, powered Chinese Taipei past (Las Vegas) Nevada 7-0 on Aug. 24 to win the Little League world title, they all took a long victory lap around Lamade Stadium with their championship banner. They slid into third base. They picked dirt off the mound. They stood in a line and bowed to their fans.\n\nFrom the stands, the pitcher\u2019s father watched with his mother, Huang Yung-Ling, his sister, Lin Yen-Hsi and his grandmother, Yu Pei-Ying. They all spoke to me via Yen.\n\n\u201cHe works really, really hard and he's been thinking about coming to the U.S to play ball,\u201d Yu Pei-Ying said. \u201cAnd he finally achieved that. That was his goal.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a story behind every Little Leaguer: the early life dreams, the escapades with teammates, the coach who leads them, the family that sacrifices, the little sister who tags along.\n\nWhat was she most proud about?\n\n\u201cThe first home run that he hit,\u201d the 10-year-old said brightly.\n\nThat moment came earlier in the tournament. During the championship game, her brother one-hit Vegas in five nearly flawless innings. His fastball, which notched above 80 mph at least a couple of times, according to ESPN, cut through the zone. His slower curve served to be as much as a force against hitters expecting the heater.\n\nIt was his bat, though, that put the game away. Hitting from the right side, he drove a hard grounder down the third base line in the top of the fifth inning that cleared the bases. The triple put his team ahead 5-0 and well on the way to victory.\n\nHis manager, Lai Min-Nan, had told him to not try and hit a home run all the time. Just hit the ball solidly, like the player he admires over all others.\n\n\u201cAcun\u0303a Jr.!\u201d his mother says with a laugh.\n\n\u201cNo pitchers, only Ronald Acun\u0303a,\u201d Yen says, speaking for the whole family.\n\nWhen her son was young, his mother says, he liked to watch a lot of videos about baseball, which made him realize how much he liked it. His father got into boxing in middle school but had played Taiwan\u2019s national sport as a boy. His son started in third grade.\n\nHis manager, Lai Min-Nan, played the game until around college age but but got injured and decided to become a physical education teacher. But he realized he could contribute to the baseball community by coaching Little League.\n\nOver two decades, he led the team to Chinese Taipei championships in 2003, 2008, 2015, 2017 and 2025. The only time he made it to Williamsport was in 2015, when his team was eliminated by Mexico.\n\nWhen the group was in fourth grade, Lin Chin-Tse recalled they probably won one tournament out of 20 or 30. But their coach thought they might be something in 2 or 3 years.\n\nLai Min-Nan developed an array of arms that pushed him over the top. Lin, his ace, topped 82 mph when he arrived here, striking out 20 in 11 innings overall during the team's 5-0 run that included four shutouts.\n\n\u201cTry to catch (that) in that short distance,\u201d team interpreter Phillip Chang said after the LLWS championship game. \u201cNobody wants to. Even the coach will say, \u2018I\u2019m not gonna do it.\u2019\"\n\nHe pointed to catcher Tsai Yu-Ge: \u201cHe\u2019s the guy who will say, \u2018I\u2019ll do it.\u2019 He\u2019s the unsung hero.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m the one who votes the MVP because I\u2019ve been living with this group for over two weeks, that guy is the MVP, in my heart,\u201d Chang said. \u201c(Manager Lai Min-Nan) would say he\u2019s the MVP, too.\u201d\n\nThey believe in the team concept, that the opponent can\u2019t beat you if they can\u2019t score against your pitchers or defense. After Lin Chin-Tse had sailed through five innings, the sole blemish standing between him and a perfect game, his manager opted to go to Chen Qi-Sheng.\n\nLai Min-Nan wanted the closer to enjoy the moment, too. He had confidence in everyone on the team, which brought home a Little League title for the first time in 29 years.\n\nIt has been quite a run for Lin Chin-Tse and his father, a 30-year boxing coach. Lin Yu-Ting represented Taiwan, over which China claims sovereignty, when she won an Olympic boxing gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Lin Shih-Hua\u2019s pupil trained her.\n\n\u201cHe didn't get involved,\u201d says Yen, our interpreter. \u201cHe let his student teach her.\u201d\n\nLin Shih-Hua has been to the United States before to coach boxing, but the rest of the family were making their first trip.\n\nI asked him what he liked better these days, boxing or baseball?\n\nThen his daughter chimed in: \u201cShe says he\u2019s betraying boxing!\u201d\n\nHer brother wants to learn English when he returns home, a souvenir from the new friends he met here and an emblem of the dream he carries to reach the major leagues.\n\nMaybe if he gets there, Acun\u0303a will still be there waiting for him.\n\nSteve Borelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999. He spent 10 years coaching his two sons\u2019 baseball and basketball teams. He and his wife, Colleen, are now sports parents for two high schoolers. His column is posted weekly.

      "text": "Little League World Series highlights: Chinese Taipei beats Nevada for 2025 title\nAn international team is once again on top of the Little League baseball world.\nChinese Taipei, the Asia-Pacific region champion, coasted to the 2025 Little League World Series title behind its ace pitcher, Lin Chin-Tse.\nChin-Tse\u2019s pitching line was simply dominant \u2013 5 innings, 1 hit, 0 errors, 0 walks, 4 strikeouts \u2013 and he also had the most important hit (a bases clearing triple) in the game during his team\u2019s five-run bottom of the fifth inning.\nOn the strength of Chin-Tse\u2019s arm and the stellar defense behind him, Chinese Taipei defeated Nevada, 7-0, to win its first Little League World Series title since 1996, snapping a 29-year drought for the country.\nTo help its championship effort, Chinese Taipei turned three double plays on Sunday and recorded the team\u2019s fourth shoutout during the 12-day LLWS in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. It was the 18th LLWS title for Chinese Taipei overall, the second most behind the 40 combined titles won from United States teams.\nNevada was aiming to win the state\u2019s first LLWS title and continue the United States\u2019 streak of six LLWS championships in a row dating back to 2018.\nJayden Lee is the new pitcher for Nevada, Chinese Taipei has big inning\nAccording to ESPN, he hasn't pitched in two weeks. He struck out the first batter he faced on five pitches. He then walked three consecutive batters to load the bases. Chinese Taipei's Lin Chin-Tse hit a scorching liner down the line in left field that cleared the bases and the lead grew to 5-0 Chinese Taipei after that play. Chinese Taipei's Tsai Yu-Ge hits a ground ball and the play went to home to prevent a run from scoring. However, the errant throw from the catcher past third base and into left field allowed the baserunner and the batter to score. After five innings, Chinese Taipei led 7-0.\nWhat was the attendance at the LLBWS championship game?\nAccording to Little League, the attendance number for the 2025 LLBWS championship game was 25,812.\nChinese Taipei no-hitter no more\nChinese Taipei had its no-hitter by Lin Chin-Tse broken up by Nevada's Garrett Gallegos, who had a single go through the hole between the shortstop and third baseman. However, Nevada can't add on to that hit as a double play ended the inning. Chinese Taipei still leads 2-0 after the top of the fifth inning.\nLast no-hitter in the Little League World Series championship game?\nAccording to ESPN, that was in 1979.\nNevada's Luke D'Ambrosio day on the mound is over\nD'Ambrosio threw his 85th pitch to get the final out of the bottom of the fourth inning. We'll see a new pitcher next inning but for now, Chinese Taipei has a 2-0 lead.\nChinese Taipei's Lin Chin-Tse making it look easy\nChin-Tse picked up his second strikeout of the top of the fourth innning and his fourth of the game. Through four innings, he hasn't allowed a hit while throwing 49 pitches (36 for strikes).\nNevada's Luke D'Ambrosio struggles with control\nD'Ambrosio gave up an infield single to Chen Shi-Rong, who later took second on a wild pitch and eventually scored when D'Ambrosio made a throwing error on a throw to first base from a bunt attempt. D'Ambrosio, who's up to 69 pitches now, limited any more damage with a strikeout to end the bottom of the third inning. We have completed three innings, Chinese Taipei leads 2-0.\nChinese Taipei's Lin Chin-Tse hasn't faced a lot of resistance yet in LLWS championship game\nChin-Tse has faced the minimum number of batters (9) through three innings and has only throw 37 pitches (28 for strikes) and the perfect game is still alive.\nIs the United States streak going to end in the LLWS championship game?\nTeams from the United States have won every Little League World Series championship game since 2018. The international teams to win the LLWS was a team from Tokyo, Japan in 2017.\nChinese Taipei aggresive on the bases in the second inning\nJian Zih-De walked to start the bottom of the second inning. Zih-De took second on a wild pitch and advanced to third on a groundout. With Ho Fu-Yi at the plate and facing a 3-1 count, Luke D'Ambrosio threw ball four. The ball trickled away from catcher and Zih-De scampered home and beats the tag. Chinese Taipei leads 1-0 over Nevada after two innings.\nNevada's still seeking its first hit in the game\nChinese Taipei's Lin Chin-Tse has a perfect game with one strikeout through two innings against Nevada. We are still scoreless.\nNevada seeking the state's first LLWS title\nAccording to the Reno Gazette-Journal, Saturday's U.S. championship by Nevada's Summerlin South Little League was only the second U.S. Little League title for the state of Nevada. But now, Nevada aims for an even larger goal: the state's first LLWS title.\nNevada's Luke D'Ambrosio has trouble with top of Chinese Taipei lineup\nD'Ambrosio gave up a single with one out, hit a batter with two outs and allowed a single to load the bases with two outs before Chinese Taipei's Lai Yu-Han came to the plate. However, D'Ambrosio got a fly out to escape this jam. After one inning, we are scoreless.\nChinese Taipei dominant showing at the LLWS\nChinese Taipei has outscored opponents, 15-3, in four games so far and that includes three shutouts.\nChinese Taipei's Lin Chin-Tse breezes through first inning\nChin-Tse got a groundout, a fly out and a strikeout to compete the top of the first inning.\nNevada's offense in five games at LLWS, leads all teams coming into title game\nNevada has produced 52 hits, 15 extra-base hits, four home runs and 38 runs overall. All categories lead the LLWS entering Sunday's LLWS championship game.\nLittle League World Series championship game pitchers\nChinese Taipei's Lin Chin-Tse takes the mound for the Asia-Pacific region champion while Nevada's Luke D'Ambrosio will be the starter for the Mountain Region champion.\nCan a Little League World Series game go into extra innings?\nYes. If the score is still tied after six complete innings, then the two teams will go into extra innings starting with the seventh inning. The difference with the seventh inning and every inning needed after that, is that a runner starts the seventh inning (and beyond) on second base. That runner, according to Little League, \u201cis scheduled to bat last in that respective half inning.\u201d\u2014 Sherlon Christie\nHow many innings can a Little League Baseball player throw in a game?\nLittle League Baseball doesn\u2019t have a strict per-game pitching innings limit. However, Little League does monitor how many pitches a player can throw in a game and there are corresponding days of rest tied to how many pitches a player throws in each game. The maximum number of pitches a player can throw in a Little League World Series game is 85 pitches. However, a pitcher can go over the 85-pitch threshold to finish an at-bat that started under 85 pitches, but that batter would be the last one before the pitcher must be removed from the mound.\u2014 Sherlon Christie\nHow many innings are in a Little League World Series game?\nUnder normal circumstances, a complete Little League World Series game is played over six innings. If the home team is winning the game entering the top of the sixth inning and gets three outs against the visiting team, then the game will end with five and a half innings played as the home team will not bat in the bottom of the sixth inning. \u2014 Sherlon Christie\nHow to watch 2025 Little League World Series\nThe 2025 Little League World Series will be broadcast on ESPN platforms, with the championship game airing on ABC.

Summerlin South LL defeated Lone Peak Little League (Alpine, Utah), 6-3, in the Mountain championship game to earn a spot this year in the Little League World Series. According to Fox 5 Las Vegas, Summerlin South was the third straight team from Southern Nevada to represent the region at the LLWS. If Summerlin South can win the 2025 Little League World Series title, it will be the first team from Nevada to do it. \u2014 Sherlon Christie\nMeet the Chinese Taipei team at the 2025 Little League World Series\nTung-Yuan LL (Taipei, Chinese Taipei) cruised to a 6-1 record in the Asia-Pacific tournament to get to Williamsport this year. According to Little League, \"this will be the fourth-straight trip for Chinese Taipei as the representative for the Asia-Pacific region, starting with Fu-Lin Little League (Taipei, Chinese Taipei) earning the bid in 2022.\u201d Chinese Taipei has a rich history in the LLWS with 33 appearances, including this year. Tung-Yuan Little League made its last, and only other, trip to Williamsport back in 2015, finishing the tournament with a 2-2 record, Little League said. If it seems like Chinese Taipei is one of the international teams to watch every year, that\u2019s because Chinese Taipei is the country with the most Little League World Series titles (17), outside of the United States, with the country's last championship coming in 1996 from Kaohsiung Little League. \u2014 Sherlon Christie\nLittle League World Series: Who won 2024 tournament?\nThe 2024 LLWS finished with a thriller, as Florida claimed a 2-1 extra-innings victory over Taiwan.\nThe Lake Mary Little League team made history beyond lifting the Little League World Series trophy.

      "text": "Boxer Lin Yu-Ting wins gold medal after Olympic controversy\nPARIS \u2013Taiwan\u2019s Lin Yu-Ting, one of two female boxers targeted in a \u201cgender eligibility\u2019\u2019 controversy at the Paris Olympics, capped the turbulent experience in similar fashion.\nTriumphantly.\nLin won a gold medal Saturday night by beating Poland\u2019s Julia Szeremeta on points by unanimous decision in the finals of the women\u2019s featherweight division (126 pounds) at Roland-Garros Stadium. Leading with a crisp jab, Lin won the first two rounds convincingly and danced free from trouble in the third round.\nShe wept during the medal ceremony. Later, she indicated the emotion stemmed from something other than the controversy.\n\"During the fight, I saw images flashing and I thought about the beginning of my career, when I started boxing,'' Lin told reporters. \"All the difficult practices, the times I got injured, the competitors I fought against.\n\"There were times of great pain, times of great joy. I cried because I was so touched. I represent my country, I got the gold medal. I want to thank all the people in Taiwan who supported me, from the beginning to the end.''\nHer the victory came one night after Algeria\u2019s Imane Khelif won a gold medal by beating China\u2019s Yang Liu in the finals of the women\u2019s welterweight (146 pounds) division.\nBoth Lin and Khelif have been subjected to abuse on social media and inaccurate online speculation about their sexes even though the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said they both have met all criteria and that there\u2019s no question they are women.\nAs an elite athlete, Lin said, it was important to shut herself off from social media.\n\"Of course I heard some of the information through my coach, but I didn't pay too much mind to it,'' she said. \"I was invited by the IOC to compete at the Games, this is what I focused on.\n\"For me, focusing on the competition, that's what an elite athlete should do. As for all the noise, during the competition, I shut off all social media. I wasn't able to receive information from outside. I only focused on my competitor.''\nWhile Khelif called for an end to the bullying and spoke out against \u201cthe enemies of success,\u2019\u2019 Lin limited her public comments during the ordeal. But like Khelif, she thrived inside the boxing ring.\nLin, 28, won each of her first three bouts on points by unanimous decision before advancing to the final."

The incident took place as Taiwanese boxer Lin Yu-Ting was getting ready to receive a gold medal for winning the women\u2019s featherweight division.\nThe spectator, a woman, refused to give up the flag as she was pulled out of view by what appeared to be stadium security. Earlier the woman appeared to strike an employee in the head with a small flag stick before security arrived.\nIt was unclear if Lin was aware of the incident.\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) recognizes Taiwan as Chinese Taipei.\nAs the medal ceremony began, a spectator unfurled the Chinese Taipei flag when two other spectators rushed over and unfurled a Chinese flag.\nChina's government has claimed sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan since a civil war in China in the 1940s, when Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s Nationalists lost to Mao Zedong\u2019s Communists and rebased their government in Taiwan. Beijing uses its global clout today to require that the International Olympic Committee let Taiwan, known internationally as an island-territory, join Olympic events only as \"Chinese Taipei\" because the label implies a link to China.\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard"

      "text": "In Little League, like in kids sports, you live for the moment\nSOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, PA \u2014 Nevada manager TJ Fechser says every game has an inflection point, that moment on which everything turns.\nPitcher Garrett Gallegos had just tagged out a hitter on a diving play as part of a wild fifth-inning sequence. That was it, Fechser says.\nBut in kids' sports, if coaches handle them right, we always get our chance to grab for more big moments.\nThere were now two outs and Gallegos had one more batter. His team was ahead by two runs. He said something to himself and got a swinging strikeout to end the Fairfield (Connecticut) threat.\n\u201cThe whole sequence was really emotional,\u201d the young right-handed pitcher said after the game, \u201cthinking that was just the last out of me pitching ever pitching in Little League. It was very sentimental and like very sad, almost. But it was exciting at the same time, all the emotions together.\u201d\nNevada wound up winning 8-2, setting up the Aug. 24 Little League World Series championship against Chinese Taipei.\nOn the other side, Connecticut manager Brian Palazzolo looked around and saw two full sections of his team\u2019s fans from Fairfield. He saw the hill behind the outfield packed. He heard cheers for \u201cMetro\u201d (his team\u2019s region) all over Lamade Stadium.\nHe soaked in the scene.\n\u201cThey know what we did this summer,\u201d he said of his team\u2019s following. \u201cWe brought smiles to a lot of people. It would have been really nice to be playing in the championship, but we put on a great show for everybody.\u201d\nHe believed his team could rally.\n\u201cThey\u2019re kids, they\u2019re resilient, even after win, they put it right back. When we were in the regional, we lost and (they) said, 'Coach, we\u2019re ready to go.'\" Palazzolo said. \u201cHopefully through time and through all of our pictures we took, we could see what a great run it was.\u201d\nEven if most Little Leaguers aren\u2019t fortunate enough to play here, the event \u2014 and the games kids push themselves to try and win leading up to it all summer \u2014 provides a lens into the youth athletics experience.\nYou might have that one play from your childhood, maybe more than one, that stands out in your memory. For Connecticut\u2019s Dante Madera, you would think it was one in an earlier Little League World Series game in which his team beat Vegas. He was playing shallow and raced to snag a ball on the run that appeared far over his shoulder.\n\u201cI just sprinted back, stuck my glove out and it like hit me on the pinkie,\u201d he recounted earlier this week, bending the finger to demonstrate, \u201cand I just squeezed it and somehow caught it. I don\u2019t know how.\u201d\nWas that the best catch he had ever made, a reporter asked him?\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, smiling and shaking his head.\nWhen we\u2019re kids, and we\u2019re 12, each game, each opportunity provides another chance.\nIn the U.S. championship, after losing to Connecticut on Aug. 20, Vegas barreled to a 3-0 lead on the strength of three hits. But Connecticut responded with a run before Gallegos shut them down with two strikeouts.\n\u201cAfter the first inning, I just got the hang of it because sometimes first innings are a little bit rough to kind of get used to the game,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the big crowd. So today I just kind of had to get used to the setting and I got the hang of it during the middle of the game.\u201d\nThere were more than 29,000 at Lamade, and afterward Las Vegas\u2019 team stood on the stage below a large collection of their family members. The group began shouting \u201cUSA!\u201d and \u201cLet\u2019s go South!\u201d for their Summerlin South Little League.\nThen, after the boys met the media, they headed up the hill and changed. Kids came out to the grassy area outside their dorms and horsed around, a couple of them having sword fights with what looked like plastic bats.\nLittle League CEO Patrick Wilson says he invited Vanderbilt baseball coach Tim Corbin, a two-time national champion, here at the start of the Little League World Series. Corbin told a story of how he asked three players on his team that had played in the Little League World Series what they remember most about it.\nThey talked about their friends, swimming, playing ping pong and how incredible the food is here. It might resemble the memories your kid has at your local Little League.\nEarlier this week, Las Vegas\u2019 team met with their opponents from Chinese Taipei at a barbecue. It was a friendly interaction that involved starting to learn one anothers' languages.\nAs Wilson notes, Little League is 2 million kids, a million volunteers and 5,800 communities around the world.\nIt\u2019s a journey we undertake with our kids, just like with other sports. They pull us to fields early on Saturday mornings and into the early darkness of weeknights. When they get a little older, we travel with them and make it part of our vacation.\nSteve Greusel, 78, came to Williamsport from Las Vegas to watch his grandson, Dustin, play catcher. He said he had been to every game of all-star season, which begins the road to the Little League World Series and runs through districts, states and regionals.\nHe\u2019s originally from Pennsylvania, and he is connected with relatives and friends here. He\u2019s also learning names of his new community in Nevada. He has spotted something you might find unique to a kid baseball game.\n\u201cThe parents having confidence in their sons to play this game and let them play their way, and not really trying to interact to tell them what they need to do,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s these types of interactions \u2014 commenting, correcting or even making a spectacle of yourself \u2014 that can push kids out of sports.\n\u201cI think a lot of parents, deep down, they have what they think about as the best interests of their child and they become so passionate about that and they want to do anything possible to make sure that their kids are set up for success and they have the best experience,\u201d says Jason Sacks, CEO of the Positive Coaching Alliance, which partners with Little League for coach training.\nThe next time you see a parent explode on the sideline, he says, watch what their kid is doing. \u201cThe child is often putting their head down, looking at them, raising their hand like, 'why are you doing this?'\u201d\nThe Vegas players showed in that crucial fifth inning what they can do when we let our kids learn and execute on their own.\nA laser throw from right fielder Cutter Ricafort pinned a Connecticut runner in the basepaths between third and home. A rundown ensued and, after a number of throws, Gallegos, the pitcher, made a diving play to tag out the baserunner.\n\u201cI was thinking just to one-hop the ball so our catcher can read the ball,\u201d Dustin Greusel said. \u201cAnd I one-hopped it and we got the out.\u201d\nGreusel, whom one questioner in the media room estimated had caught nearly every inning of the postseason from the state tournament on, had created another moment.\nSo had his team, which became the first from Nevada to reach the Little League World Series final. Chinese Taipei has won 17 LLWS titles. They will be pitching Lin Chin-Tse, who has registered an 82 mph fastball here.\nTo Fechser, Las Vegas\u2019 manager, it\u2019s just another opening for the kids.\n\u201cI think everybody in this room knows that he\u2019s a tremendously hard thrower,\u201d Fechser said. \u201cWe know they\u2019re gonna compete but you gotta throw strikes. And you get the barrels through the zone, sometimes a hard pitcher helps you out a lot. That force goes the other way so we\u2019ll be prepared and we\u2019ll talk about it.\u201d\nSteve Borelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999.

      "text": "Is it safe for a 12-year-old pitcher to throw 82 mph? LLWS is a test case\nSOUTH WILLIAMSPORT, PA \u2014 Chinese Taipei manager Lai Min-Nan has been planning for this moment.\nYes, he\u2019s playing for a Little League World Series championship, but he has also managed to save his ace in the hole to throw it.\nLin Chin-Tse has overpowered opposing hitters all tournament, striking out 16 in six innings and dotting the strike zone with a fastball that has reached 82 mph.\nThanks to the efficient work of Liu Wei-Heng, a lefty who pitched a near-complete game to set down Aruba 1-0 in the international title game, Lin will start against (Las Vegas) Nevada in the Aug. 24 LLWS championship game.\nIt\u2019s a strategy, and a sigh of relief, for which youth baseball coaches across the globe can relate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessary to have him pitch but it\u2019s nice to have a strong pitcher to stand by,\u201d the manager said of Lin this week through a translator.\nAccording to ESPN, Lin\u2019s fastball seen from 46 feet away is the equivalent of a Little Leaguer facing 107 mph.\nBut how safe is it for a 12-year-old to throw that hard?\n\u201cJust throwing a baseball in general, when you really look at the velocity of the shoulder joint, it's the most kind of violent action of a joint in any sport,\u201d says John Kunkel, an orthopedic surgeon and the medical director for the Little League World Series. \u201cAnd just inherently throwing a baseball for a shoulder just puts a lot of stress on it.\n\u201cThat's why the period before the season, getting your body ready to throw is really important. And then building up, warming, all that kind of stuff. Your body really does adapt.\u201d\nAs velocities are rising from youth sports to the majors, let\u2019s consider how young pitchers can protect themselves.\nCoach Steve: Why do kids play Little League? They live for the moment\nCan throwing 82 mph hurt a kid? Monitor your max pitch count\nKunkel trained to be a sports medicine specialist with college and professional teams, including the Houston Astros and Texans.\nToday, he sees athletes of all ages, including 45-50 year old men and women who are playing pickleball or pickup basketball. He has worked three Little League World Series.\n\u201cWith different athletes, max effort is gonna produce different velocities,\u201d he tells USA TODAY Sports. \u201cAnd so that's where you get some limitations of just your own biology, your own structure. Some people are born with the ability to be able to throw that hard, especially at a young age.\n\u201cThere's not necessarily inherently more risk for somebody like (Lin) who's throwing 82. It's more on what his max effort throws are over the course of a game, season, career.\u201d\nA trend across baseball is to throw as hard as you can in a game for as long as you can. The end result, says Nick Kenney, director of medical administration for the Kansas City Royals, is seen when those pitchers reach the major leagues.\nMany of them, he says, are chasing velocity instead of trying to capture it.\nKenney points to a line from Vincent Key, the Royals\u2019 team physician: You only have so much tread on your tires: if you're gonna burn it off every time you come to a stop sign, and if you pop it, will you surprised?\nOf the trend, Kenney says: \u201cwhere the game is taking us, especially with the emphasis on extreme velo and extreme spin \u2026 it's mind-boggling. It's extremely frustrating, but we are trying to increase our ability to find risk factors.\u201d\nWhat's an effective way for a 12-year-old to pitch?\nChinese Taipei has won 17 Little League World Series titles. Lai Min-Nan, its current manager, builds his winning strategy around his pitchers controlling their fastball. Only when they demonstrate that ability will he add a slider or curve to their repertoire.\nLiu Wei-Heng, his starter in the international championship, drew confidence and energy from throwing 70% strikes (50 out of 71 pitches) against Aruba.\nDuring the 1-0 win, he and closer Chen Qi-Sheng combined for one walk over six innings. Liu pitched with runners on base in four, but calmly kept pounding strikes and trusting his fielders to make plays.\nThe two pitchers touched the low 70s with fastballs a few times when ESPN flashed their velocity but only dialed it up when they needed it for a punchout.\nBy limiting his max effort pitch count this way, Kunkel says, a pitcher is protecting himself.\n\u201cEspecially as you get into the older levels with bullpen specialization and guys are coming in saying, \u2018Hey, if I can just throw max effort for five innings, somebody else is going to come in and throw max effort for an inning,\u201d Kunkel says. \u201c'Somebody else is going to do the same thing after that.'\n\u201cWhereas 3-4 years ago, he might be thinking, \u2018Hey, I'm going to throw 85% effort to see if I can complete the game. And so then your max effort pitches are actually less than maybe they are today.\u201d\nThere are precautions young players can take before it gets to that point.\nWhen should we start throwing a curveball?\nTalk to your orthopedist about when might be the right time for a curve or slider. Kunkel says there\u2019s mixed data on when is the right time, as the technique for those pitches can differ from pitcher to pitcher.\nBiology also comes into play.\n\u201cEspecially at this age group, the difference in growth between a 10 and a 12 year old and then different 10 and 12 year olds is vastly different,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it's tough to standardize those things for a league. The data really shows us it's just those pitch counts, kind of max effort pitches, if we can manage those, that's probably our best bet as an organization trying to standardize things to keep pitchers safe.\u201d\nWhy are pitch counts so important?\nLittle League World Series pitchers are limited to 85 pitches per day and require calendar days of rest after numbers of pitches thrown: Four days for 66 or more pitches, three for 51-65, two for 36-50 and one for 21-35.\nThe LLWS went to pitch counts over inning restrictions in 2007. Before that, Mike Ludwikowski, the event\u2019s head athletic trainer, said kids were lined up at their office at 8 a.m., getting treated for their shoulders and elbows.\nThe push for pitch counts has come from American Sports Medicine Institute in Birmingham, Alabama, led by orthopedist James Andrews. We can track them across Little League and travel ball, where sometimes there aren\u2019t restrictions despite pitchers throwing a number of high-stress innings.\nOur risk of an arm injury greatly increases with fatigue. For example, Kunkel says the main stabilizer to the elbow when we\u2019re throwing is not the ligament, but the muscles around it call the flexor pronator mass.\nAs it gets tired over the course of a game, you start to rely more and more on your ulnar collateral ligament. We know today that a torn UCL leads to Tommy John surgery.\nKunkel doesn\u2019t think a young pitcher should be throwing all his pitches max effort a game. Rest, both in between games and in the offseason, is crucial.\n\u201cAre we playing baseball all year round? Do we play other sports? Are we picking up a basketball in the winter? Are we playing something else also in the summer?\u201d he says. \u201cIf you're throwing from mound max effort all year round, that's going to set you up for arm issues.\u201d\nWhat can young pitchers do to avoid an injury?\nOver the past two weeks here, we\u2019ve seen kids lay out out all over Lamade Stadium for grounders in the hole and fly balls in the gap. Nevada manager TJ Fechser says he expects it of his players.\nWhen you\u2019re 12, Kunkel says, you quickly bounce back from the nicks and bruises and your body adapts. You can overcome physical things faster than even major leaguers might.\nBut everyone needs to take a step back from competitive play at some point during the year.\n\u201cThat's not inherent just to baseball, but specialization in any sport,\u201d Kunkel says. \u201cWe know that leads to more chronic injuries. You're using one movement pattern, one group of muscles over time, and that's just going to set you up for those chronic overuse injuries, whereas if you vary it and you're playing different sports in different seasons, you're working on different movement patterns, different muscles.\n\u201cNot only does that decrease your risk of chronic overuse injuries, but it makes you a better athlete, because you're learning to use your body in different ways.\u201d\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends kids take at least one day off a week and two months off from a sport per year. The later you can specialize, the better. You can put if off by playing one sport competitively, and others recreationally.\n\u201cHaving some time throughout the year where you're taking a break, playing different sports, those are different ways to kind of lower the volume of those max effort pitches over the course of a year and career,\u201d Kunkel says.\nIf you have any pain while you\u2019re playing, stop throwing and rest. And once you rest the amount of time a sports medicine physician recommends, understand it might take just as long to ramp yourself up to full speed.\nThink about when big leaguers return from an injury, they go on rehabilitation assignments to the minor leagues, where they slowly increase their innings over a number of games.\n\u201cI always say that there's really no way to prevent injury,\u201d Kunkel says. \u201cWhen you're an athlete, you're pushing your body to compete and win. And there's no way to take the risk out of that. Athletes are always going to push their bodies and there's going to be injury. So injury risk reduction is what we're trying to do.\n\u201cAnd the best way to reduce risk is making sure that your body is ready to compete and then managing that overuse portion of it: not specializing, playing a variety of sports and then whether after injury or before the season, start slowly ramping up and making sure you're ready to go.\u201d\nSteve Borelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999.
