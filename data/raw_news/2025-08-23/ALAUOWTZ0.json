  "title": "Why South Korea\u2019s Pledge to Buy More US Oil May Be Mission Impossible",
  "description": "Long-term contracts and ownership ties with Middle Eastern NOCs limit Korea\u2019s flexibility to buy more US oil, despite diplomatic pressure from Trump.",
  "content": "South Korea, one of America\u2019s top-10 trading partners, has become one of the most high-profile targets of Washington\u2019s shifting tariff regime. After months of tug-of-war diplomacy, the United States imposed a 15% duty on Korean imports effective August 7 \u2013 less severe than the 25% levy initially floated but still painful for Asia\u2019s fourth-largest economy. In exchange, Seoul agreed to ramp up investment in US projects and pledged to purchase $100 billion worth of American energy products, a deal that was meant to soften the blow. Seoul has already quantified the potential tariff impact, forecasting just 0.9% growth for 2025 (compared to 1.8% at the beginning of this year). This would mark the weakest pace of growth since the pandemic in 2020, underscoring how vulnerable the country\u2019s export-led model is to tariff shocks. The energy pledge, however, looks harder to fulfil in practice than it is on paper. Washington expects South Korea to substantially increase imports of US crude, but refiners across the country have already been gradually shifting in that direction for years. According to Kpler data, imports of WTI Midland rose from 283,000 b/d in 2020 to 465,000 b/d in 2025, supported by favourable conditions under the bilateral free trade agreement and Korea\u2019s freight rebate system that often makes WTI cheaper than Middle Eastern grades. Yet any incremental moves from here would be constrained. Total Korean crude imports have held steady in the 2.8 to 3 million b/d range for the past five years, and while American volumes have risen, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and the UAE remain deeply entrenched in the supply mix. Saudi Arabia alone delivered 956,000 b/d to Korea in 2025 to date, nearly double the volumes from any other supplier, and though Russian flows dropped sharply after the start of Ukraine war, the gap was quickly filled by other Middle Eastern producers. What keeps these flows in place is not just habit or geopolitics, but the underlying design of Korea\u2019s refining system. WTI is a light crude, while South Korea\u2019s highly complex refineries are configured to process heavier grades, predominantly Middle Eastern ones. Shifting too heavily toward US barrels (and subsequently, toward a lighter product yield) would leave parts of these facilities idle, eroding efficiency and profitability. Korea operates five refineries, and each illustrates why diversification is easier said than done. The largest, Ulsan, fully owned by SK Energy, already blends WTI with heavier grades from Iraq, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia to run at capacity. Yeosu, half-owned by Chevron, follows a similar pattern, comingling rising volumes of WTI with heavier Iraqi barrels. Onsan and Daesan refineries, partially owned by Saudi Aramco with stakes of 63% and 17% respectively, lean overwhelmingly on Arab Light and Arab Medium, together making up about 80% of their crude slate. With Saudi interests directly embedded in their ownership structure, any push to substitute American crude faces resistance. Meanwhile, Incheon, the smallest refinery, struggles to operate even at 50% capacity and faces operational constraints that leave it in no position to absorb excess light oil.\n\nEven in refineries that could handle more WTI, the economic rationale has weakened. Light crudes like WTI yield larger amounts of naphtha, a feedstock for the petrochemical industry. But global oversupply, fuelled by relentless Chinese capacity expansion, has created a petrochemical glut. Margins have collapsed, and on August 20 South Korean petrochemical companies announced a collective 25% cut to the country\u2019s naphtha-cracking capacity. For refiners, naphtha cracks have been consistently negative, meaning that buying more light crude would not only strain refinery configurations but also risk churning out products that have no profitable market. Layered on top of these operational limits are the contractual obligations that tie Korea to Middle Eastern suppliers. Unlike American producers, who sell mainly on spot terms, Saudi or Iraqi exporters prefer long-term contracts with little flexibility. Failure to lift agreed volumes risks penalty or even termination, a strict policy that reflects the abundance of global demand for their barrels. In practice, this means Korean refiners cannot simply displace Middle Eastern grades without risks to their supply security in order to accommodate Washington\u2019s demands, however strong the diplomatic pressure may be. Related: US Oil Drillers Continue to Play It Safe The tension between politics and market realities became clear in June, when South Korea\u2019s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy convened an emergency meeting with crude and LNG importers after the Israel\u2013Iran crisis escalated. The government used the moment to urge refiners to diversify away from their deep reliance on Middle Eastern crude, arguing that regional instability underscored the risks of overdependence. Yet even this direct warning failed to alter behaviour: imports continued to flow overwhelmingly from the Middle East, with only incremental increases in US volumes. For now, Seoul is edging toward a middle course, raising US crude imports at the margins while relying on its entrenched heavy grades from the Gulf. But the deal struck under tariff pressure exposes an uncomfortable truth: South Korea cannot satisfy Washington\u2019s demands without undermining the very foundations of its refining system and petrochemical industry. Heavy reliance on Middle Eastern supply is locked in by refinery design, contractual obligations, and ownership stakes. \n\nThat leaves Seoul caught between a rock and a hard place, vowing to please its most important ally by buying barrels it cannot fully use, or preserve the operational logic of its energy system and risk further trade retaliation. In practice, the likeliest outcome is that Korean refiners will marginally increase US purchases, blending those extra WTI barrels with heavier Middle Eastern grades, a compromise that secures refinery balance but falls short of Washington\u2019s ambitions. Either way, the price of accommodation is high. South Korea\u2019s case is a poignant reminder that, as much as politicians seek to force deals, they cannot rewrite the laws and economics of refining.\n\u2022 Despite Delays Suriname\u2019s Oil Boom is Fast Becoming a Reality",

      "text": "It is a long time coming, but the impoverished South American country of Suriname is poised to enjoy the fruits of a major oil boom. For nearly a decade, the government, in the capital Paramaribo, hungrily eyed neighboring Guyana\u2019s drilling success, which transformed that country into the world\u2019s newest petrostate. Yet Suriname\u2019s offshore drilling, despite yielding positive results, repeatedly experienced uncertainty and delays. This took place as the economic situation in the former Dutch colony deteriorated, causing to President Chandrikapersad Santokhi, a former police commissioner, to lose office. Newly appointed president opposition leader Jennifer Geerlings-Simons faces uncertainty over the economy and the anticipated oil boom.\nParamaribo, since the 2020 pandemic, has been battling yet another deep financial crisis, which spilled over into violence at the start of 2023 as the cost of living spiraled out of control. Protestors stormed Suriname\u2019s National Assembly in February 2023 as then-President Chan Snatokhi\u2019s International Monetary Fund (IMF) mandated economic austerity hit hard in a country where nearly a fifth of the population lives below the poverty line. Despite the hardships triggered by the austerity program, which included slashing government spending, removing energy subsidies, and sharply devaluing the Suriname dollar, there are signs of success. The IMF Executive Board, after reviewing the arrangement in March 2025 stated:\n\u201cThe objectives of the program have been broadly achieved. The economy is growing, inflation is receding, public debt is declining, the autonomy and governance of the central bank have been strengthened, and investor confidence is returning.\u201d\nRelated: Energy Transition Stalls as Oil Super-Cycle Risks Return\nThere is, however, still a long way to go. The IMF outlined the need for Paramaribo to enforce fiscal discipline, strengthen tax administration, improve regulatory transparency, and bolster governance mechanisms.\nDespite notable progress, these enhancements were insufficient for President Santokhi. During July 2025, he lost office due to the fallout from those stringent economic austerity measures and ongoing corruption allegations. It was President Santokhi who saw Suriname\u2019s burgeoning offshore oil boom as a silver bullet for a crisis-prone economy, which over the last decade contracted sharply. For 2015, Suriname reported gross domestic product (GDP) of $5.13 billion, yet by 2024 it had plunged 13% to $4.46 billion. This marked decline is hurting the population of one of South America\u2019s poorest countries, where one in six people live in poverty\nDuring January 2020, APA, the then operator of Block 58, announced the first discovery in Block 58 at the Maka Central-1 well. This was followed by four more discoveries, with the most recent being the Krabdagu discovery made during 2022.\nSource: APA Corporation EnerCom Oil & Gas Conference.\nSince the last discovery, a series of appraisal wells were drilled at the Sapakara and Krabdagu discoveries, which confirmed the presence of a reservoir containing an estimated 750 million barrels of crude oil. The oil discovered in Suriname was determined to be light and sweet with API gravities of between 35 degrees and 60 degrees with a low sulfur content. Those are important attributes in a world with a focus on producing high-quality low low-emission fuels, which are cheaper and easier to manufacture from lighter sweet crude oil.\nFirst oil from one of the five significant oil discoveries made in offshore Block 58 was initially expected in 2026, although this did not occur, with TotalEnergies postponing development of the oil acreage. Poor exploration results, including several dry wells, inconsistent seismic data, and concerns about the reservoir related to a high gas-to-oil ratio, impacted the multi-billion-dollar final investment decision (FID). For those reasons, TotalEnergies at the end of 2022 postponed the FID to further appraise and better define the oilfield's attributes.\nFinally, in October 2024, TotalEnergies and APA announced the $10.5 billion FID for developing the Sapakara and Krabdagu discoveries, targeting first oil in 2028. The latest news from TotalEnergies shows development of Block 58 is well underway. The project, dubbed GranMorgu, is located 93 miles offshore east of Paramaribo, targeting a reservoir containing recoverable oil resources of over 750 million barrels.\nSource: APA Corporation Third Quarter 2024 Financial and Operational Supplement.\nGranMorgu will be comprised of one drillship and a semi-submersible rig with 16 production wells and 16 injector wells. The facility is designed with nameplate capacity of 220,000 barrels per day and storage for up to 2.1 million barrels. GranMorgu will yield 220,000 barrels of crude oil and 450 million cubic feet of natural gas each day. Commissioning and first oil are projected for 2028, which represents a two-year delay from Paramaribo\u2019s original timeline.\nThe carbon intensity of oil extraction from GranMorgu is forecast to be low. This is an important attribute in a low carbon world where governments are substantially reducing greenhouse emissions and energy companies pledge to be net carbon neutral. This includes TotalEnergies, which plans to be net carbon zero across its worldwide operations by 2050. The supermajor recently confirmed the GranMorgu project fits that goal with an all-electric Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel being installed at GranMorgu. TotalEnergies is committed to no routine flaring and for all gas produced to be injected into the FPSO\u2019s tanks.\nFor these reasons, GranMorgu is forecast to emit less than 16 kilograms of carbon per barrel of oil equivalent extracted. This is lower than the global average of 18 kilograms of carbon produced per barrel of oil equivalent lifted, but higher than neighboring Guyana, where an average of only nine kilograms of carbon is discharged per barrel. This will ensure Suriname retains its status as a global carbon sink. The 38 million acres of forest covering the former Dutch colony absorbs 8.8 million tons of carbon annually, while the country only produces seven million tons. TotalEnergies pledged to assist Paramaribo with maintaining Suriname\u2019s status as a carbon-negative country.\nOnce GranMorgu is operational, it will generate considerable income for a fiscally challenged Paramaribo, which is struggling to find sufficient income to balance the budget while meeting sovereign debt repayments. The potential government revenue is boosted by the national oil company and industry regulator Staatsolie securing a 20% interest in GranMorgu. This stake, which is worth $2.4 billion, forms an important plank in Staatsolie\u2019s goal of tripling revenue to almost $1.8 billion before the end of this decade. While estimates vary, GranMorgu is expected to earn $16 billion to $26 billion of revenue for Paramaribo over the life of the oilfield, dwarfing Suriname\u2019s 2024 GDP of $4.46 billion.\nBy Matthew Smith for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\n- Uranium Stocks Remain Red Hot After Fundamentals Kick In\n- Brazil Extends Aram Block Deadline as Petrobras Confirms New Oil Finds\n- East Coast Dodges Direct Hit as Erin Tracks Into Atlantic"

      "text": "What are WTI Midland Futures?\nWTI Midland futures are financial contracts that allow participants to buy or sell a specified quantity of WTI Midland crude oil at a predetermined price on a future date. These contracts serve as essential tools for managing risk and capitalizing on market opportunities, providing exposure to the unique characteristics of WTI Midland crude.\nPrices of WTI Midland futures are intimately connected to the dynamics of the WTI crude oil market, with distinct regional considerations. Economic indicators, geopolitical events, and supply-demand fundamentals all contribute to the price movements of WTI Midland futures, and traders utilize these contracts to navigate and respond to market forces.\nWhat is WTI Midland?\nWTI Midland represents unblended WTI crude directly from the Permian Basin to Cushing, Oklahoma. It is considered a purer form of WTI, distinct from blended crudes that may result from the mixing of different oil streams at Cushing. Recent market trends show a premium for WTI Midland over NYMEX Crude, reflecting concerns about blending at Cushing and the desire for a more assured quality of crude.\nWhat is the Difference Between WTI and WTI Midland?\nThe key distinction lies in the purity of the crude. WTI Midland is unblended, offering a more direct and reliable supply from the Permian Basin. In contrast, WTI may include blended crudes meeting NYMEX specifications, introducing an element of uncertainty about the specific grade."

      "text": "Cenovus to Buy MEG as Canada\u2019s Oil Sands Consolidate Further\nAsia is turning to ammonia\u2026\nEarlier this month, Mexico and\u2026\nPresident Trump announced a deal that imposes a 15% tariff on imports from South Korea, a move that averts a steeper 25% levy originally threatened by Washington. The agreement, unveiled two days before the August 1 deadline for countries to strike bilateral deals, is similar to those accepted by the EU and Japan.\nMost significantly for energy markets, South Korea committed to purchasing $100 billion worth of U.S. liquefied natural gas and other energy exports, a move hailed by Trump as a win for American workers and energy producers.\nSpeaking on Truth Social, Trump described the pact as a \u201cFull and Complete Trade Deal\u201d and claimed it would inject $350 billion into the U.S. economy through Korean investments, which he said would be \u201cowned and controlled by the United States, and selected by myself.\u201d\nThe South Korean government, led by President Lee Jae Myung, welcomed the deal, emphasizing that it restores a level playing field for Korean exporters now facing similar tariff terms as those of Japan and the European Union, both of whom secured recent deals with Washington. \u201cWe have set the conditions to compete with major countries on an equal footing or on better terms,\u201d Lee said, highlighting that the agreement would remove uncertainty from the country\u2019s critical export sector.\nTrump also claimed that under the deal, South Korea would eliminate import duties on a range of American goods, including cars, trucks, and agricultural products. However, South Korea later clarified that while U.S. products would see improved market access, highly sensitive domestic sectors like rice and beef remained protected from liberalization due to national food security concerns.\nThe deal follows a high-profile Korean lobbying campaign, which saw corporate leaders from Hyundai, Samsung, and Hanwha travel to Washington to pledge new U.S. investments in advanced manufacturing. South Korea\u2019s Lee is expected to visit the White House within two weeks to finalize investment details and discuss unresolved issues, including defense and steel tariffs.\nWhile the agreement shores up South Korea\u2019s export competitiveness in the face of Trump\u2019s aggressive tariff policy, critics note the irony that Seoul\u2019s long-standing free trade agreement with the U.S. \u2014 under which tariffs were meant to be effectively zero \u2014 has now been overshadowed by Trump\u2019s \u201cdeal-by-deal\u201d approach. According to Chul Chung, president of the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, South Korea has preserved parity with its global peers but \u201clost the competitive advantage they once had.\u201d\nWith just one day left before the August 1 deadline, markets will be watching closely for any last-minute agreement or extensions. The fate of the U.S.-China trade deal remains unclear, with the trade truce between the two set to expire on August 12 and both countries working to extend that truce for another 90 days.\nBy Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com"

      "text": "Cenovus to Buy MEG as Canada\u2019s Oil Sands Consolidate Further\nAs countries move from fossil\u2026\nWashington and its allies are\u2026\nThe Commerce Department just opened a Section 232 \u201cnational security\u201d probe into imported wind turbines and parts\u2014quietly on Aug. 13, publicly today. That matters because 232 isn\u2019t a press release; it\u2019s a legal on-ramp to more tariffs on top of the new 50% duty already applied to the steel and aluminum content in turbines and components.\nTranslation: wind hardware just got pricier, and it could get pricier still.\nHere\u2019s the operational read: the U.S. wind build is heavily import-dependent for blades, drivetrains, and electrical systems. In 2023, the U.S. brought in about $1.7B of wind equipment, with roughly 41% from Mexico, Canada, and China. If you tax the metal inside the machine\u2014and potentially layer more 232 duties later\u2014you squeeze project profit margins, renegotiate Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs\u2014long-term contracts to sell the power), or delay FIDs. None of those outcomes lowers your Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE\u2014think of it as the average lifetime price per unit of electricity once you add up all the costs).\nWood Mackenzie pegs the tariff bite at +7% for turbine costs (+5% total project costs) under the earlier tariff proposals; in a universal 25% tariff scenario, turbine costs could rise ~10% and LCOE up ~7%. And that was before Commerce slapped a 50% surcharge on the steel/aluminum content\u2014so the floor just moved higher. Expect original equipment manufacturers to reroute supply chains, localize sub-assemblies, and raise prices anyway. Vestas has already said the quiet part out loud: these costs flow straight through to electricity prices.\nDon\u2019t confuse this with an offshore-only story. Onshore wind is where the bulk of U.S. volume lives, and it\u2019s far more sensitive to every $/kW swing, gearbox delivery delay, and tower steel price jump. Section 232 is also being deployed against other \u201ccritical\u201d imports (planes, chips, pharma), so wind isn\u2019t a one-off carve-out\u2014it\u2019s part of a broader, durable trade posture that project finance now has to underwrite.\nWinners and losers? Near-term winners include U.S. tower fabricators and any blade/drivetrain maker who can credibly and quickly localize. Losers are developers stuck with fixed-price PPAs and engineering firms with thin contingencies. Grid bottlenecks and permitting are still the bigger choke points, but tariffs aren\u2019t a rounding error anymore\u2014they\u2019re line-item pain.\nThe probe suggests that \u201cbuy more domestic, pay more near-term\u201d is policy, not rhetoric. Expect delayed Commercial Operation Dates (CODs\u2014the day projects actually flip the switch and start earning revenue), tougher PPA negotiations, and a faster push to U.S. content. Wind still looks okay economically on paper, just with a higher metal cost and a thinner margin for error.\nBy Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com\nJulianne Geiger is a veteran editor, writer and researcher for Oilprice.com, and a member of the Creative Professionals Networking Group."

That\u2019s likely a hint that it would boost the supply of domestic and cheap foreign crude to process at refineries amid weak margins and weak domestic demand for transportation fuels.\nOver the past year, consumption of the road transportation fuels \u2013 gasoline and diesel \u2013 has been trailing the levels from just two years ago, when China was emerging from nearly three years of Covid-related lockdowns. That\u2019s not only because of the pent-up demand back in 2023. A large part of the lower gasoline and diesel demand is due to the soaring sales of electric passenger cars and trucks and LNG-fueled heavy-duty vehicles.\nBy Charles Kennedy for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com"

  "argos_summary": "The United States imposed a 15% tariff on South Korean imports, prompting Seoul to pledge $100\u202fbillion of U.S. energy purchases and increased investment in U.S. projects, but the country\u2019s 2025 growth is now projected at only 0.9%. Korea\u2019s ability to meet the crude\u2011purchase target is constrained by refinery designs that favor heavy Middle Eastern grades, ownership ties to Saudi Aramco, and long\u2011term contracts that make shifting to lighter WTI risky. Even modest increases in U.S. crude would strain refinery operations and naphtha margins, creating economic and operational challenges. At the same time, Suriname\u2019s GranMorgu oil project is poised to generate substantial revenue amid delays, while U.S. rig activity remains near four\u2011year lows and WTI Midland futures offer a purer benchmark for market participants.",
