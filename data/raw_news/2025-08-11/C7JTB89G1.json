  "content": "TOKYO (Reuters) -The U.S. dollar held steady on Tuesday, with markets braced for a key consumer inflation report later in the day that could shape expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.\n\nThe U.S. dollar index - which measures the currency against six counterparts, including the euro and yen - was steady at 98.497 as of 0046 GMT, after advancing 0.5% over the past two sessions.\n\nPrior to that, the dollar had retreated as U.S. President Donald Trump's dovish-leaning pick to replace a Fed governor, and similarly inclined potential candidates for chairman, led traders to increase easing bets.\n\nCooling inflation could cement bets for a reduction next month, but if signs emerge that Trump's tariffs are fuelling price pressures, that might keep the central bank on hold for now.\n\n\"Risk-reward heading into U.S. CPI this week is for a modest USD bounce as any upside surprise will challenge market pricing of almost a full cut by September,\" TD Securities strategists wrote in a research note.\n\n\"A downside surprise, on the other hand, is unlikely to move Fed pricing and the USD as much,\" they said.\n\n\"The reasoning is that for the Fed to consider an outsized cut of 50 basis points, the catalyst will be further deterioration in the labour market and not a downside CPI miss.\"\n\nThe dollar on Monday largely ignored Trump's signing an executive order extending a pause in sharply higher tariffs on Chinese imports for another 90 days, a move that some market participants said was expected.\n\nWith the United States and China seeking to close a deal averting triple-digit import tariffs, a U.S. official told Reuters that chip makers Nvidia and AMD had agreed to allocate 15% of China sales revenues to the U.S. government, aiming to secure export licences for semiconductors.\n\nThe Aussie fetched $0.6518 , little changed from Monday with economists and investors widely expecting a quarter-point rate reduction from the RBA, after second-quarter inflation came in weaker than expected and the jobless rate hit a 3-1/2-year high.\n\nHowever, the risk of a surprise has been amplified by a change in decision-making at the central bank, and many traders were caught out when the policy board refrained from lowering rates last month.\n\nCryptocurrency bitcoin was unchanged at around $118,845, after it climbed as high as $122,308.25 on Monday that took it close to the all-time peak of $123,153.22 from mid-July.",

  "summary": "The U.S. dollar index was steady at 98.497 as of 0046 GMT, after advancing 0.5% over the past two days. This follows a key consumer inflation report that could influence expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. However, if signs emerge that Trump's tariffs are fuelling price pressures, the central bank may keep its current stance. The Australian central bank is expected to reduce its current rate to $0.6518, with economists expecting a quarter-point reduction after weaker than expected Q2 inflation and a high unemployment rate.",
