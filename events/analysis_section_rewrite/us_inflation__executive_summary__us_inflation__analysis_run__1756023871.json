      "feedback": "The analysis would be world-class if you sharpen the causal chain: clearly separate the macro regime drivers (cloud/AI productivity, labor/automation dynamics, EV/tariff policy) from company- and asset-specific examples, and deliver a single, crisp base-case thesis with a transparent 3-horizon framing and explicit probabilities (base/alt/invalidation). The piece currently runs long and mixes macro, sector, and private-market anecdotes; compress to 4–6 executive sentences or bullets, with the 0–3 week section reframed as watch-items and kept tightly linked to the 3–6 month horizon. Ground the structure in first-principles: anchor the base-case on documented productivity uplift and capex momentum (provide explicit ranges from sources for cloud/AI growth and discount-rate impact) and pair with clearly defined catalysts and invalidation points (e.g., Rivian EBITDA breakeven by 2027 and R2 at a $45k starting price; DOE loan framework; EV/tariff shifts) so risks are measurable. Quantify and reconcile numbers: extract and present numeric anchors (growth rates, multiples, dividend/yield context, justness premium) rather than generic statements, and explicitly resolve apparent conflicts (e.g., IBM hiring pause vs. labor-well-being signals) with a short, source-grounded rationale. Citation discipline should be tightened: confirm that every factual claim cites only IDs from the SOURCE MATERIAL, favor the most material sources for each assertion (0G3A676BP, 4LQD15CFU, P0K0UEOHU, JVKCZAPVG, TN66GHPAT, ILYC1M41F, FOM34PUWA, A7VLN74BK, J99EM2TPZ, RHXDOHQQX, 9W8ZUIBDY, UPV3X2MQ6, GX057ADL7, V7GV8YBQU, 8VMO3PFEO), and flag any conflicts or gaps needed to reconcile across sources.",
