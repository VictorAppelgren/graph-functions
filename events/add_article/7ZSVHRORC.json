      "summary": "US equity futures bounce after a two‑day slide, driven by a favorable court ruling that lifted Google and the Mag‑7, pushing S&P futures 0.5% and Nasdaq 0.7% higher. Global bond sell‑off eases, with US 30‑year yields up 2bp while European and Japanese long‑dated bonds fall; gold gains its seventh straight session and WTI falls 1.7% amid OPEC+ supply‑boost speculation. Cyclicals are positioned to outperform as the yield curve steepens, and the Fed is expected to cut rates later this month, with JOLTS and the Beige Book as key catalysts.",
