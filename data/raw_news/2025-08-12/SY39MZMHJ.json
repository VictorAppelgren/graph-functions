  "description": "Ignore the critics and check out this great horror movie",
  "content": "Prime Video has added 56 new movies and 13 new TV shows in August, and one title in particular really stood out to me. Even so, its poor Rotten Tomatoes score might put you off.\n\nWolf Man is the latest Leigh Whannell movie, and after his great track record with films like The Invisible Man and Upgrade, it was disappointing to see this one getting panned critically. Currently, it has a 48% score on the site, indicating it's \"rotten\".\n\nBut I'm a huge fan of Wolf Man, having given it a 4-star review when I watched the movie a few months ago. I also got the chance to interview the lead actor, Christopher Abbott, who spoke to me about the movie's tragic elements.\n\nWhile Wolf Man may not be considered worthy of a spot on our best Prime Video movies list, here's why you should check it out.\n\nWhy you should watch Wolf Man\n\nWolf Man is an emotional, scary take on the classic Universal Monster movie creature, as we follow a family man named Blake who attempts to protect his family from a werewolf.\n\nIn terrifying scenes, though, Blake becomes infected and slowly transforms into one himself. I was really impressed by how this was done, and as Blake becomes more monstrous, he's unable to understand or communicate with his family.\n\nOf course, it is scary in places with some effective jumpy moments, but it was the emotionally driven nature of it that really got me. It's a deeply sad movie about loss, grief, and change, and uses horror tropes well to communicate this.\n\nYou may have already seen Weapons, which I gave a 5-star review to, and Wolf Man features another excellent performance from Julia Garner opposite Christopher Abbott. It's a star-studded cast with an equally great performance from a young Matilda Firth, who plays the couple's daughter.\n\nDespite the fact that it hasn't been well received by the majority of critics, I do think there's an audience here, especially if you love character-driven horrors and one-location chills.\n\nNow that it's streaming on Prime Video, why not try it out and see what you think?\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 Weapons director assures fans it's just as good as his first horror movie hit: 'If you liked Barbarian, this is more \u2013 and in a good way'\n\u2022 Weapons has some of the best viral marketing I\u2019ve ever seen, but the new horror movie\u2019s director admits he \u2018was not a believer at the beginning\u2019\n\u2022 This critically panned horror movie with a divisive 49% on Rotten Tomatoes was added to Prime Video in August \u2013 here\u2019s why I think you should watch it",

AMC+ is less than $1 through Prime Video \u2013 here are 5 movies with over 90% on Rotten Tomatoes to watch first\nEnjoy titles from AMC, Shudder, IFC Films, and more\nWith 29 Prime Video subscription add-on prices being slashed, now is the perfect time to check out some of the lesser-known services available in the sale. Among these is AMC+, which currently has a deal that's way too good to miss.\nFor just $0.99 per month for the first two months, you can enjoy everything AMC+ has to offer from critically acclaimed movies and shows to hidden gems you may not have heard of.\nAMC+'s library is so impressive that I believe it rivals some of the best streaming services. As a horror fan, I was also delighted to see that Shudder and IFC Films have a lot of titles in its catalog, so it's a great place if you want some scares. Here are five titles I highly recommend checking out.\nAMC+ two-month subscription: was $9.99 per month now $0.99 at Prime Video\nStream great movies like The Babadook, Tigers are Not Afraid and Frances Ha for just $0.99 a month for two months. This deal brings down the regular price of $6.99 (ads) or $9.99 (ad-free) to just $0.99, but expires on July 11.\n1. The Babadook\nAge rating: R\nDirector: Jennifer Kent\nMain cast: Essie Davis, Noah Wiseman, Hayley McElhinney, Daniel Henshall\nRT critical score: 98%\nJennifer Kent made quite the first impression in her directorial debut, which is all about the titular Babadook, a character in a pop-up children's book that has no business being quite that scary.\nIn this excellent movie, Kent delivers pure terror which is only elevated by the brilliant lead performances by Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman, a troubled widow and her son, who begins to develop signs of erratic behavior.\nBeyond being absolutely terrifying, it's full of heart and explores themes of parenting, among others. It's 100% worth your time.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\n2. Late Night With the Devil\nAge rating: R\nDirectors: Colin Cairnes and Cameron Cairnes\nMain cast: David Dastmalchian, Laura Gordon, Ian Bliss, Fayssal Bazzi\nRT critical score: 97%\nSomething about a live TV show gone terribly wrong is very intriguing isn't it? If you agree, then you're going to love Late Night with the Devil because it parodies talk shows and takes us on a terrifying ride.\nDavid Dastmalchian is brilliant at playing a host who is competing with a rival called The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (which actually did exist, if you didn't know). I like the fact that Dastmalchian's fictional Night Owls show is going up against an actual 70s program, as it makes the whole thing feel more real.\nSoon, his petty Tonight Show rivalry is the least of his worries when a variety of scary supernatural incidents take place live in front of a studio audience. This one might put you off talk shows for life, quite honestly.\n3. Frances Ha\nAge rating: R\nDirector: Noah Baumbach\nMain cast: Greta Gerwig, Mickey Sumner, Adam Driver, Michael Zegen\nRT critical score: 92%\nMoving away from horror for a moment (I do watch other things!), I really want to recommend the brilliant Frances Ha, which is one of Greta Gerwig's earlier acting credits before she went on to direct Lady Bird, Little Women and Barbie.\nHere, Greta plays a struggling 27-year-old dancer living in Brooklyn. This is a great coming of edge movie that's full of heart, laughs and romance, following Frances as she goes from apartment to apartment, trying to find a job and a stable partner.\nIt's intensely relatable, and a complicated love letter to all the people we meet in life.\n4. The Novice\nAge rating: R\nDirector: Lauren Hadaway\nMain cast: Isabelle Fuhrman, Amy Forsyth, Dilone, Charlotte Ubben\nRT critical score: 93%\nIsabelle Fuhrman, known for her brilliant work on the horror movie Orphan, delivers another great performance in The Novice as a freshman who joins her university's rowing team.\nThings soon get intense as she takes on an obsessive physical and psychological journey to make it to the top, no matter the cost. It's a tightly wound thriller and sports movie mash up and a very intense watch.\nThis is another directorial debut on this list, and honestly, it's a very impressive one. Even if you have no interest in rowing, it's easy to get sucked in.\n5. Tigers Are Not Afraid\nAge rating: R\nDirector: Issa L\u00f3pez\nMain cast: Paola Lara, Juan Ram\u00f3n L\u00f3pez, Ianis Guerrero, Rodrigo Cortes\nRT critical score: 97%\nFinally, Tigers are not Afraid is a wonderful blend of fantasy, crime and horror, and fans of magical realism will seriously want to check this out.\nThe movie follows a young girl who joins a gang of street children after her mother disappears. It uses horror themes to explore children who are left behind by the Mexican drug war.\nThe movie is frightening in many ways, and has a unique style that will no doubt stay with you for many months to come. It's not the kind of movie that will leave you easily, and that's a good thing.\nYou might also like\nLucy is a long-time movie and television lover who is an approved critic on Rotten Tomatoes.

      "text": "Weapons has some of the best viral marketing I\u2019ve ever seen, but the new horror movie\u2019s director admits he \u2018was not a believer at the beginning\u2019\nHave you visited maybrookmissing.net?\n- Weapons director Zach Cregger has admitted he \"was not a believer\" when it came to the movie's viral marketing\n- However, the realistic marketing campaign has gone down well with fans\n- The new movie is in theaters from August 8\nWeapons is the hugely anticipated new movie from Zach Cregger, and while fans may be thoroughly spooked by the marketing they've seen so far, the director has revealed he was nervous at first.\nThe new horror movie, which arrives in cinemas on August 8, centers around a group of children who simultaneously disappear at 2:17am.\nSpeaking to TechRadar, Cregger said: \"They came to me and they were like, 'we're thinking of doing this'. They had a term for it that I wasn't even aware of, but they're like, 'we're gonna make this website, we're gonna make it seem like it really happened.'\n\"And I'll be honest, I was like, 'I don't think I like this idea because we're trying to trick people', and then are people gonna get annoyed and they realize it's just a movie and they're gonna be like f*** this movie.\"\nHe added: \"That was my fear, but they were like just trust us. So I was like, 'OK!', and then sure enough, everybody really responded to it, so they get all the credit, you know, and I, and I love what they did. I love it, but I was not a believer at the beginning, I'll tell you.\"\nThe website Cregger is referring to is MaybrookMissing.net, which is set up to look like a real missing person's case. There's teasers for the movie, fake CCTV footage and even a reference to his previous movie Barbarian for eagle-eyed fans.\nWeapons has really gone hard on this marketing technique, which is known as an Alternate Reality Game. Movies such as Cloverfield and District 9 have adopted this approach in the past, setting up websites and hotlines to entice audiences into a story.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIn my opinion, they work incredibly well with horrors or mysteries and it really got me hyped to see the movie, so it's a job well done.\nThis led me to ask about fan theories based on the marketing campaign, as I was sure people have drawn their own conclusions about what to expect from it. Cregger told me: \"Oh yeah, I've seen a lot of theories and I don't even really want to comment on them because if I discredit some of them, then it's, I'm giving people ammo for for for spoiling it.\n\"But the one that I will say that I've seen a lot that I'm always just kind of like, 'wow', is that people say like an alien is involved in this, and I think that's probably my favorite fan theory.\"\nWith plenty of intrigue here, you'll have to go and see the movie if you want to unravel the mystery.\nYou might also like\n- 7 new horror movies on Prime Video, Shudder, HBO Max and more in July 2025\n- Alien: Earth's official trailer is here \u2013 and the sci-fi horror series' xenomorph isn't the only frightening creature that'll need to be avoided\n- Five Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2 has a trailer that\u2019s even more discouraging than the first movie, but die-hard fans will be pleased with one detail\nLucy is a long-time movie and television lover who is an approved critic on Rotten Tomatoes.

      "text": "5 new Prime Video movies with over 90% on Rotten Tomatoes I recommend streaming in August 2025\nThere's some absolute classics available to stream this month\nA new month brings a whole lot of new movies and shows for Prime Video viewers to enjoy, but with such a huge library of content, it\u2019s easy to miss the best Prime Video movies being added each time the calendar page turns, but that\u2019s why we\u2019re here to help.\nAmong the new titles this month are some absolute classics spanning nearly fifty years of cinema, with everything from hideous horrors to boxing biopics, cool crime to war-time westerns landing on one of the best streaming services.\nAnd, you won\u2019t need to scroll for hours to find them, as I've picked out the five best movies added to Prime Video in August 2025, each with over 90% on Rotten Tomatoes from the critics.\nCreed (2015)\nRuntime: 133 minutes\nMain cast: Michael B. Jordan, Sylvester Stallone, Tessa Thompson, Phylicia Rashad, Anthony Bellew\nDirector: Ryan Coogler\nRT Score: 95%\nBoth the seventh installment in the Rocky franchise and a trilogy starter in its own right, Creed is a must watch for sports drama fans.\nFollowing his final bout in Rocky Balboa, Sylvester Stallone\u2019s eponymous boxing legend returns, this time as a mentor for Adonis Creed (Michael B. Jordan), the son of his late rival turned friend Apollo Creed. Adonis never knew his father, but being the son of one of the GOATs means boxing is in his blood, and it's not long before Balboa is watching history repeat itself as underdog Creed prepares to enter the big time.\nWhile following similar beats to the iconic original film, director Ryan Coogler (of Black Panther fame) manages to bring a fresh take to a well worn franchise and the film deftly manages to be both a story about Jordan\u2019s young up and comer while satisfyingly taking Stallone\u2019s veteran in to his later years. Taking the franchise back to basics, Creed is considered by many to be the best Rocky film since the original.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nPulp Fiction (1994)\nRuntime: 154 minutes\nMain cast: John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Ving Rhames, Rosanna Arquette, Christopher Walken, Bruce Willis\nDirector: Quentin Tarantino\nRT Score: 92%\nThe film that informed a whole sub-genre of cool crime flicks in the 90s, Pulp Fiction is Quentin Tarantino at his absolute best.\nVia a number of interweaving and non-linear plots, the film tells the story of a number of small-time LA crooks crossing paths over the course of a few chaotic days. John Travolta\u2019s Vincent Vega and Samuel L. Jackson\u2019s Jules Winnfield serve as the linchpin of the film, as their mis-adventures find them intertwined with their gangster boss Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames), his wife Mia (Uma Thurman), down-on-his-luck boxer Butch (Bruce Willis) and more.\nTarantino\u2019s follow-up to Reservoir Dogs, the film expands on everything that made his debut so successful. The story is more complex, the pop-culture infused dialogue even more whip smart and the directorial flair even more stylish, with a sound track that\u2019s pitch perfect. It wouldn\u2019t be an understatement to call Pulp Fiction one of the most influential films of all time \u2013 pick almost any crime drama from the decade that followed and you\u2019ll find Tarantino\u2019s fingerprints all over it \u2013 and while the director\u2019s filmography may have got much more ambitious since, it\u2019s hard to argue against Pulp Fiction being QT\u2019s magnum opus.\nReturn of the Living Dead (1985)\nRuntime: 91 minutes\nMain cast: Clu Gulager, James Karen, Don Calfa\nDirector: Dan O'Bannon\nRT Score: 91%\nGooey, gory and downright hilarious, Return of the Living Dead is a punk rock horror comedy from one of the minds behind the Alien franchise.\nWhen a warehouse foreman decides to show off a secret military experiment being stored in one of his lots, he accidentally releases a gas that reanimates the dead into flesh-eating zombies. As the epidemic spreads through town, the two workers responsible \u2013 Frank (James Karen) and Freddy (Thom Matthews) \u2013 must battle the undead hordes with a taste for brains.\nOriginally conceived as a sequel to Night of the Living Dead, the film morphed into very much its own beast, drawing huge influence from the grimy punk culture of the era and ditching the original notions of straight up horror as Alien co-writer Dan O\u2019Bannon jumped into the director\u2019s chair. For fans of 80s horror, the film has everything you could want, from cheesy performances, to plenty of practical gore and a classic punk soundtrack, while horror fans in general should find plenty to enjoy in this curio of the genre.\nA Fistful of Dynamite aka Duck, You Sucker! (1971)\nRuntime: 154 minutes\nMain cast: Rod Steiger, James Coburn, Romolo Valli, Maria Monti, Rik Battaglia, Franco Graziosi\nDirector: Sergio Leone\nRT Score: 92%\nThis epic western is a somewhat forgotten gem from one of the absolute masters of the genre.\nSet in the early days of the Mexican Revolution in 1913, the film follows John Mallory (James Coburn), a former IRA member, and Juan Miranda (Rod Steiger), a Mexican Outlaw, as the two cross paths and concoct a plan to rob a bank using Mallory\u2019s explosives knowledge. However, when the explosion ends up freeing a group of political prisoners unknowingly detained in the bank, the pair end up becoming unwitting heroes of the revolution.\nDirected by the legendary Sergio Leone, the film is somewhat overshadowed by his earlier Man with No Name trilogy and Once Upon a Time in the West. However, A Fistful of Dynamite is every bit the spaghetti western classic, and in many ways, a more interesting film than the director's previous efforts as he experiments with tense action and outright comedy. A film that deserves to be talked about as much as its stable mates, A Fistful of Dynamite is the perfect epic western for a lazy afternoon.\nRaging Bull (1980)\nRuntime: 129 minutes\nMain cast: Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Cathy Moriarty, Nicholas Colasanto, Theresa Saldana, Frank Vincent\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\nRT Score: 92%\nAn altogether different beast of a boxing movie than the aforementioned Creed, Raging Bull sees Robert DeNiro deliver a career best performance.\nRaging Bull is the true story of the rise and fall of champion middleweight boxer Jake LaMotta (DeNiro) as he rises through the ranks on his way to glory. However, as Jake\u2019s success continues, he becomes embroiled with the Mafia and increasingly paranoid and jealous of his wife Vickie (Cathy Moriarty), finding both his career and personal life spiraling out of control.\nFrom director Martin Scorsese, the film feels of a piece with the likes of Taxi Driver and Mean Streets, exposing the scuzzy underbelly of historic New York.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nLeigh Whannell stunned us with The Invisible Man and his reimagining of the classic Wolf Man as a terrifying tale of grief has proven he's a horror director at the top of his game.\nPros\n- +\nDeeply upsetting and haunting, it's so much more than another werewolf movie\n- +\nChristopher Abbott and Julia Garner both deliver great performances\n- +\nThe scares are effective, you'll be on edge the whole time\n- +\nReally gross, visceral transformation scenes\n- +\nFantastic use of sound and visual design throughout\nCons\n- -\nSeems to over-rely on jumpscares at certain points\n- -\nThe Wolf Man's design might divide people\n- -\nCould be considered a little predictable in places\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nWolf Man is the latest horror movie from Leigh Whannell, who\u2019s known for horror hits including Insidious, Saw, and most recently, his adaptation of the Universal Monster movie The Invisible Man. Wolf Man was one of my most anticipated horror movies of 2025, and I'm pleased to say that Whannell has delivered once again, with a surprisingly heartfelt tale that takes us on a horrifying journey of grief and loss.\nThese themes are present throughout the whole movie, and it wastes no time in throwing us straight into the action after a family \u2013 parents Blake (Christopher Abbott) and Charlotte (Julia Garner), and their daughter Ginger (Matilda Firth) \u2013 are attacked by a creature during a full moon. The family end up barricading themselves into their isolated farmhouse hoping to protect themselves from the danger that lurks outside \u2013 but unknowingly, they\u2019ve inadvertently locked danger inside with them.\nBlake\u2019s body begins to deteriorate and transform into something monstrous, confronting the viewer with horror that is both physical and psychological. Much like The Substance, our favorite body horror of 2024, it doesn't shy away from the gory detail and physiological trauma of a human being metamorphosing into something utterly inhuman . Expect nails ripping off, a jaw being broken, and bones moving \u2013 and it sounds as dreadful as it looks, thanks to a sound design that leaves nothing to the imagination, and which really elevates the whole movie. And yet, as horrific as it is to witness, it's the psychological aspects of Blake's transformation that scared me the most. The loss of a person\u2019s identity is a recurring theme across many body horrors; it\u2019s perhaps captured best in the way that Jeff Goldblum\u2019s scientist slowly loses his mind as he loses his humanity in The Fly, and in Wolf Man Whannell approaches a similarly traumatic metamorphosis through a very sympathetic lens.\nWithout giving too much away, Wolf Man uses some clever POV shifting so we get to experience Blake\u2019s transformation through both human and wolf's eyes, with the latter making for some particularly distressing scenes. As he changes into a ferocious wild animal, Blake can no longer understand his terrified wife and daughter., everything is more heightened. Their inability to communicate cleverly mirrors Blake and Charlotte's already strained relationship.\nThe goal of a the original Universal Monster movies was to be scary, and the creature in the latest Wolf Man adaptation certainly is. There are some effective jump scares here, again thanks in part to the sound design, which are best experienced on a big screen, though some might argue that the movie is too reliant on the jump. I'm inclined to agree \u2013 and for me the psychological aspects of the story are just as frightening if not more so.\nThe creature design did seem to divide audiences when teasers for Wolf Man were first released, and while I do think it could have been a bit more, well, wolf-like in places, no horror movie has so far really managed to nail the werewolf, and any shortcomings in this department are easily made up for by Abbott\u2019s performance as a man losing both his own humanity and the people he loves. I can easily forgive some slightly-off special effects when a story is as rich and thought-provoking as this, proving that sometimes raw, human emotion is the scariest thing of all. All three of the lead actors are fantastic, but 10-year-old Matilda Firth deserves a special shoutout for the way in which she skilfully navigates the terrifying, dark, jump-filled landscape of Wolf Man, displaying a confidence and maturity way beyond her years. Considering I'm approaching 30 and I watched a lot of this through my fingers, she's officially braver than me.\nWolf Man is quite a way to start 2025, and while January is not typically the season for horror, it's already set the bar high for scarier entries among the new movies we\u2019re looking forward to this year. You\u2019ll want to catch it in the theater for the best experience \u2013 but you might want to make sure there's not a full moon that night, as it could make for a nerve-jangling walk home.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nYou might also like\n- Warner Bros drops trailer for sci-fi horror Companion, but it spoils too much of the plot\n- Mouthwashing review: this low-poly horror masterpiece will haunt me for a long time\n- My favorite supernatural horror series got kicked off Paramount Plus, but you can now stream it for free\nLucy is a long-time movie and television lover who is an approved critic on Rotten Tomatoes.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nZach Cregger has proven he's a master of the horror genre with the new movie Weapons, which tells a terrifying tale that is arguably even better than the director's previous film Barbarian.\nPros\n- +\nNon-stop dread, the horror doesn't stop just because it's daytime\n- +\nGreat performances from an all-star cast\n- +\nConstantly engaging, you won't want to look away\n- +\nManages to go even harder than Barbarian\n- +\nGreat score\nCons\n- -\nNon-linear pacing might frustrate some viewers\n- -\nThe 'big reveal' might not satisfy everyone\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nZach Cregger burst onto the horror scene in 2022 with what looked to be a simple tale about a double booked Airbnb in the movie Barbarian. With the film praised so highly by horror fans, how could he possibly outdo himself?\nEnter Weapons, a new movie that I genuinely believe is even better than Barbarian due to its wonderful cocktail of horror, dark comedy and mystery that keeps you guessing throughout.\nWeapons has had some of the best viral marketing I\u2019ve ever seen for a horror movie. Indeed, it's not all hype and no substance, as after watching the movie I can report that it lives up to all the scary videos and the real looking website you've seen online.\nWeapons follows a shocking mystery that shocks a small town. At 2:17am, all but one child mysteriously vanishes from the same class, leaving a sea of worried parents and baffled police officials behind to pick up the pieces.\nFingers are soon pointed towards Justine Gandy (Julia Garner) after the town realizes that it was only the teacher's class impacted by this terrifying phenomenon. CCTV footage shows the children all running, arms outstretched, their destination unknown, and Gandy becomes ostracized as a result.\nShe's just one of the main characters we follow in the movie, though. The others are Archer Graff (Josh Brolin), a worried father, Paul Morgan (Alden Ehrenreich), a police officer, and Andrew Marcus (Benedict Wong), the school principal.\nThe less I say about this movie, the better because it's good to know as little as possible before watching Weapons. But just know that this mystery leaves the entire community stumped and soon puts them in danger too.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThis is a movie that doesn't let up. Often with horror movies we feel safer when there's scenes set in the daytime, but Weapons has you constantly on edge from the ominous intro all the way to the final credits. It's terrifying and anxiety inducing \u2013 everything you could want from a Barbarian follow-up.\nCregger told me during an interview that \"if you liked Barbarian, this is more \u2013 and in a good way\" \u2013 and he's absolutely right. It does dial the horror up to 100, and left my jaw on the floor for a lot of it. Some of Weapons scariest moments happen when you least expect it as you find yourself absorbed in the investigation.\nThis is a very character driven movie. As a result, we do spend a lot of time getting to know the members of the town, often when they're alone. There's some excellent scenes that give us insight into how they're feeling while at their homes, or during nightmare sequences.\nIt's easy to feel sympathy for the characters but also frustration as well. Each character feels very well-rounded. This troubled town is full of very different personalities and they all shine through here.\nThe town of Maybrook becomes scarier thanks to the eerie score, composed by Cregger alongside his two friends, brothers Ryan and Hays Holladay. This was Cregger's first time composing for one of his own movie's and he's done a brilliant job.\nFor me, Weapons is a masterpiece but I know some fans might not like the non-linear pacing, as it can feel slow at times when the tension is building. But if you like character-driven horrors that build to a shocking reveal, you're going to love this.\nIn the trailer, the child narrator teases that \u201ca lot of people die in a lot of weird ways in this story\" and that's very true. To find out how, exactly, you'll have to be brave and go and watch it when it arrives in theaters on August 8 in the US and UK, and August 7 in Australia.\nYou might also like\n- 7 new horror movies on Prime Video, Shudder, HBO Max, and more in August 2025\n- I watched the first six episodes of Alien: Earth, and it's the Peter Pan-inspired sci-fi horror show I didn't know I needed on Disney+\n- I hit pause on my Prime Video subscription the moment I saw Hulu\u2019s new TV show lineup for August 2025\nLucy is a long-time movie and television lover who is an approved critic on Rotten Tomatoes.

      "text": "Wolf Man lead Christopher Abbott explains why the horror movie has a 'tragic element' to it\nIt's not just scary, it's deeply sad too\nWolf Man is the latest Blumhouse horror movie to grace our screens, with horror director Leigh Whannell returning to showcase his take on the classic Universal monster movie. He's done it before with The Invisible Man, spinning it as a tale of gaslighting and domestic abuse, and his vision for Wolf Man tells a similar, emotionally devastating tale, making it a great entry into this year's new movies.\nSpeaking to TechRadar, lead actor Christopher Abbott spoke about why Blake's transformation into the horrifying titular character means the horror is as much a tragedy as anything else, as the theme of loss runs throughout the narrative.\nWhen asked if any other performances influenced his, he told us: \"Yeah, I would say The Fly, Elephant Man, there's a little David Lynch in there. I guess there's sort of like a tragic element with both of those monster creatures, you know, and I think this has that.\"\nThis was one of my most anticipated horror movies of 2025, and it really did deliver. While, yes, it was scary and the jumpy moments were effective I did find myself more disturbed by the psychological torment and the emotional moments, especially when it came to the breakdown and total loss of communication between Blake and his wife and daughter (played by Julia Garner and Matilda Firth, respectively).\nWolf Man features some brilliant scenes where the POV shifts from the wolves to the humans, so we get to see both sides of the situation. Their inability to communicate and understand each other makes Blake's transformation deeply sad, as he's morphed into something completely unrecognizable, mirroring the ways we can't communicate with any species except our own. That sense of isolation and the primal animal instinct taking over is the real horror at the heart of Wolf Man. The audience already knows Blake and his wife Charlotte's marriage is strained, and now they've had the ability to talk it out ripped away.\nAbbott added: \" They're miscommunicating. They're talking around each other, they're not communicating well. You just need that idea to then help set up the more fantastical thing where, where the communication then gets taken from you. And then how do you, how do you then communicate when you're not even, uh, physically able to?\"\nNot only was there the breakdown of a bond between husband and wife, but also a father and daughter. Abbott praised his young co-star Matilda Firth, who played his on-screen daughter Ginger, revealing: \"She was oddly seasoned. It felt like she was oddly seasoned. I loved her, but it was almost off-putting. She felt too much like a pro. I felt like I was working with like an 80 year old theater vet. But she just takes things in stride. She's there to play.

      "text": "This critically panned horror movie with a divisive 49% on Rotten Tomatoes was added to Prime Video in August \u2013 here\u2019s why I think you should watch it\nDon't listen to the critics\nPrime Video has some great new additions in August, including 56 new movies and 13 new TV shows, but the one I'm recommending today has a divisive 49% Rotten Tomatoes rating.\nAn aggregator site is usually a decent indicator of quality. For example, my 5-star review of Weapons matches the critics' consensus of 96%, but sometimes we find ourselves disagreeing with the overall opinion.\nPersonally, I was very excited to see the 2008 home invasion movie The Strangers on there this month. But a quick glance at Rotten Tomatoes would tell you it was \"rotten\", as it's got 49%, meaning it's not good enough for our best Prime Video movies round-up.\nBut it's one of my personal favorites, and I'm here to tell you why you should give it a go, alongside the 7 new horror movies on Prime Video, Shudder, HBO Max, and more that were added this month.\nWhy you should give The Strangers a chance\nUnlike the characters in the movie, who should've run a mile, I'm inviting you to invite the titular strangers into your homes. This is a great movie to watch on the best streaming services, because being on the couch watching a home invasion horror always hits different.\nThe premise is simple and follows a young couple who are terrorized by three masked assailants over the course of a single evening at a remote summer home, featuring everything you could want from a movie like this.\nThe Strangers joins plenty of other movies in the home invasion sub-genre, but I don't really understand why it's been received so poorly. It follows the formula perfectly and still manages to shock you.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThere are some really effective scares in The Strangers and some great tension building throughout, and the complicated relationship between the two leads only strengthens the isolation.\nJames (Scott Speedman) and Kristen (Liv Tyler) aren't much comfort for each other, as they're dealing with the uncomfortable aftermath of a rejected marriage proposal. This awkwardness and sense of melancholy seem to drive them both apart, so even though there are attempts at reassurance, when the attackers strike, the whole atmosphere just feels awful.\nThe movie does a lot with a relatively small cast made up of Speedman, Tyler, the three masked intruders, and Glenn Howerton as Mike, James' friend who had been contacted to come and pick him up following the romantic rejection.\nOne of the reasons this movie was judged so harshly is that we don't really find out why the attackers have chosen to target this home. Perhaps a lack of motive is frustrating to some, but I found the random act of violence quite compelling.\nThis is also Bryan Bertino's directorial debut, and to me, it was a solid effort indeed, and like it or loathe it, the movie has become well-known in horror circles, so it, thankfully, hasn't faded into obscurity.\nYou might also like\n- I found 5 inspiring documentaries on Netflix and Prime Video that prove watching TV can actually be good for you\n- 5 new Prime Video movies with over 90% on Rotten Tomatoes I recommend streaming in August 2025\n- Does Prime Video have a free trial?\nLucy is a long-time movie and television lover who is an approved critic on Rotten Tomatoes.

      "text": "3 new horror movies are coming to Prime Video in June but there\u2019s only one I recommend watching\nThere's a clear winner here\nPrime Video recently updated its horror library, but out of everything new in June, there's only one horror title that really stands out to me.\nI've already recommended eight new horror movies on Netflix, Shudder, HBO Max, and more in June 2025, but if you're sticking with Prime Video this month you won't want to miss one all important title.\nHere are the three horror movies coming to the streamer in June, including the one you absolutely must not miss, as it's among one of our best Prime Video movies.\nNosferatu\nWhen: June 27\nRT score: 84%\nRuntime: 132 minutes\nDirector: Robert Eggers\nMain cast: Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, Nicholas Hoult, Lily-Rose Depp, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Emma Corrin, Willem Dafoe\nI've spoken about my love of Nosferatu a lot, but honestly, I need to talk about it again just to stress how much you need to see this movie.\nRobert Eggers' latest horror movie is streaming from June 27 on Prime Video and it's undoubtedly the best pick this month. It's miles ahead of the two other horror titles that have been added recently.\nLily-Rose Depp gives the performance of her career as Ellen, a woman who is the obsession of Nosferatu after the two become psychically linked. The movie follows Ellen's torment and the extent of the obsession, resulting in an adaptation that is wonderfully gothic, macabre and bleak.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThere's a brilliant ensemble cast attached, which is a contributing factor to why Nosferatu was nominated for four Academy Awards (although, it sadly didn't win any).\nRings\nWhen: Streaming now\nRT score: 8%\nRuntime: 102 minutes\nDirector: F. Javier Guti\u00e9rrez\nMain cast: Matilda Lutz, Alex Roe, Johnny Galecki, Aimee Teegarden\nWith a very low Rotten Tomatoes score of just 8%, it's safe to say Rings was a critical flop. But if you are interested in the follow-up to the much superior The Ring, it's been added to Prime Video.\nThe plot serves as a sequel to The Ring and features the same cursed tape from the original movie (both the original and the remake). It follows a young woman who finds herself on the receiving end of a terrifying curse that threatens to take her life in seven days.\nThe critics consensus for this one wasn't very good, with many criticizing it for an over reliance on jump scares and it's similarity to the original movie. The Malta Times described the movie as \"an endless loop of muddled mythology and rehashed plot points\", which is a very scathing criticism indeed.\nThe Town That Dreaded Sundown (2014)\nWhen: Streaming now\nRT score: 66%\nRuntime: 86 minutes\nDirector: Alfonso Gomez-Rejon\nMain cast: Addison Timlin, Travis Tope, Spencer Treat Clark, Ed Lauter, Veronica Cartwright\nAdmittedly, this one does fare a lot better than Rings, but its 66% Rotten Tomatoes score means that it narrowly misses out on a spot on our best Prime Video movies round-up.\nStill, this one is a decent watch for any horror fan and is actually an improvement on the original 1976 version, which only scored 46% on the Tomatometer, so that's something.\nThe slasher movie follows a masked serial killer who wreaks havoc in a city that witnessed similar murders 65 years ago. Meanwhile, an ordinary high school student in the area could be the key to exposing the eery new threat.\nYou might also like\n- Scream 7 is one of my most-anticipated new horror movies \u2013 here are 5 things I want to see\n- Prime Video added 50 new movies in June including three of my all-time favorites\n- 5 new Prime Video movies with over 91% on Rotten Tomatoes to stream in June\nLucy is a long-time movie and television lover who is an approved critic on Rotten Tomatoes.
