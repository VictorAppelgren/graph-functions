  "title": "Review: Indigo Girls and Melissa Etheridge make a natural pairing at sold-out State Fair concert",
  "description": "Their personalities, philosophies and \u203290s music meshed with a sing-along crowd.",
  "content": "Doctors want women to know the nuanced reality of hormone therapy for menopause\n\nUS seeks to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he refused plea offer in his smuggling case\n\nYuen: Meet the women who will clean up your hot messes for free\n\nReusse: Middle weekend of state amateur baseball tourney brings out the fans \u2014 and coolers of beer\n\nMelissa Etheridge, Jon Cleary and mushroom foraging: What to do on Day 4 of the Minnesota State Fair\n\nWhat to know: Four ways ICE is training new agents and scaling up\n\nSome things go together naturally at the Great Minnesota Get-Together. Like chicken in a waffle cone, Sweet Martha\u2019s cookies with all the milk you can drink and, somehow, Soft Serve Royal Raspberry Beer. Who knew? It\u2019s no surprise that Melissa Etheridge and the Indigo Girls teamed up at the grandstand. That\u2019s a natural pairing of artists who made their debuts in the late \u203280s, blossomed in the \u203290s and have maintained followings ever since. And it\u2019s no surprise that their Yes We Are Tour, a co-headlining trek, drew a sellout grandstand crowd of 13,929 Sunday for sounds that are divergent but compatible. The scene: Maybe the stage backdrop for the Indigo Girls, who opened, set the scene from the get-go. It depicted the wall in an elementary school classroom under Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Not only was there a map prominently showing the Gulf of America and a photo of Education Secretary Linda McMahon, but a blackboard had the phrase \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d written over and over in chalk as if by a punished student. The messages were pointed and not surprising, considering that both Etheridge and the Indigos are LGBTQ icons. And the backdrop fit the vibe at the grandstand, where the crowd seemed to be there for community as much as for the music. The music: It was 90 minutes of heartland rock vs. 90 minutes of folk-rock, though Amy Ray brought rock \u2018n\u2019 roll fire to a few Indigo Girls songs, namely the searing \u201cGo\u201d and seething \u201cLaramie.\u201d Etheridge\u2019s heartland flavor has a heavy blues accent, as she journeyed from her home state of Kansas to California in 1982. Her voice sounds as raspy as ever (she seemed hoarse at times, but maybe that\u2019s redundant). And she played more guitar than I remember in her four-person band.\n\nIn the Indigos\u2019 set, Emily Saliers took a few guitar solos on electric and acoustic, but the standout soloist was guitarist/dobroist Jeff Fielder, one of six musicians who accompanied the Georgia folk-rock duo. They had a special guest on background vocals, New York singer/songwriter Lucy Wainwright Roche, who also sang her own \u201cOpen Season,\u201d during which she forgot the lyrics midsong. The Indigo Girls, Amy Ray, left, and Emily Saliers, open the night at the grandstand. (Richard Tsong-Taatarii/The Minnesota Star Tribune) Biggest takeaway: This is an obvious and smart pairing of co-headliners, whose philosophies and personalities not only mesh but whose music complements each other. It\u2019s prudent for compatible artists who are no longer arena headliners to pair for a double-bill that\u2019s perfect for the amphitheater and state fair circuits. Coolest moment: When Etheridge, in her studded cowgirl hat, waltzed onstage in dark shadows in the middle of the Indigos\u2019 \u201cKid Fears,\u201d the crowd went crazy. She not only sang a verse but stayed for the next number, the inevitable finale \u201cCloser to Fine,\u201d a sing-along from 1989 that has become more epic thanks to its prominence in the 2023 \u201cBarbie\u201d movie. Review: Minnesota hip-hop vets Atmosphere finally get their best day at the fair Another memorable moment was Etheridge\u2019s late-in-the-show one-two punch of the belt-along \u201cCome to My Window\u201d and the revved up \u201cI\u2019m the Only One.\u201d Low point: Saliers\u2019 voice was noticeably diminished, with both her range and potency limited. As for Etheridge, she has a propensity to extend her songs with long rhythmic jams, featuring her strummed guitar or bluesy harmonica. Typical was how she elongated her finale \u201cLike the Way I Do\u201d into a meandering 14-minute jam. Best banter: Etheridge said her kids were asking her what the \u203290s were like. She told them, \u201cThere were more choices, more hope, more understanding, more diversity.\u201d And the crowd roared.\n\nEven though she performed only one song, Wainwright Roche took the opportunity to share her experience about the fairgrounds: \u201cI just took my 2-year-old on the kiddie rides. The elephants go up and down. She loved it.\u201d But Wainwright Roche said it scared the you-know-what out of her. Want to stay in the loop on all things fair-related?

      "text": "Drawing the biggest crowd ever for a homegrown hip-hop act at the Minnesota State Fair grandstand was just one of many reasons Saturday\u2019s concert by Atmosphere felt like a truly big deal.\nAfter packing the fairgrounds with their Soundset festivals every Memorial Day weekend in the late-2010s \u2014 and playing to plenty of other big hometown crowds over their 30 years together \u2014 Atmosphere rapper Slug and his DJ cohort Ant could have been blas\u00e9 about their belated debut at the fair\u2019s big stage. (The main reason they never played there was because the fair too closely followed Soundset for so many summers.)\nOn the contrary, the indie-rap pioneers went all out to make it a memorable, and maybe even historic, night. They brought along three other seasoned, esteemed rap acts from other cities: Los Angeles vets Cypress Hill and the Pharcyde, plus Chicago hitmaker Lupe Fiasco. They also recruited longtime homie Brother Ali to make a rousing surprise appearance at show\u2019s end.\nAnd they just brought it in general. After modern Minnesota pop-rap star Yung Gravy\u2019s hair-brained 2023 appearance and some other questionably light and fluffy hip-hop performances on the grandstand over the years, this was one rap concert that hit hard and was full of heart and personality.\nThe scene: A resoundingly millennial- and middle-aged crowd \u2014 lots of Twin Cities babysitters will have extra spending cash for the fair\u2019s nine remaining days \u2014 most of the 12,306 attendees were old enough to have caught Atmosphere\u2019s original Soundset parties at First Avenue in the late-1990s. Throw in the cool summer\u2019s-edge weather and a blazing sunset, Saturday\u2019s show was a reminder of what made those full-scale Soundset fests of the 2010s so enjoyable beyond the great music.\nThe music: It was a good night in the music department, too. Despite the old-school crowd, Atmosphere dropped in a heavy smattering of recent tunes early in its set as if to reiterate that it\u2019s still cranking out new records and putting some fresh spins on its sound every couple of years.\nThe night\u2019s newest tune, \u201cReally\u201d \u2014 from next month\u2019s upcoming record \u201cJestures\u201d \u2014 showed a reggae dancehall influence that paired nicely with Cypress Hill\u2019s overtly weedy performance. Other modern songs like \u201cOkay\u201d and \u201cThe Loser Wins\u201d followed a similar feel-good, problems-shrugging vibe. Later in its 75-minute set, though, Atmosphere went way, way back to mark its 30th anniversary with \u201cGod\u2019s Bathroom Floor\u201d and \u201cScapegoat.\u201d\nConversely, Cypress Hill stuck largely to its best-known tunes from more than a quarter century ago. Those included \u201cInsane in the Brain\u201d and \u201cHand on the Pump\u201d near the start of its hourlong set, and \u201cI Ain\u2019t Goin\u2019 Out Like That\u201d and \u201c(Rock) Superstar\u201d near the end \u2014 each heavily pumped up after all this time by the band\u2019s stellar drummer, Eric \u201cBobo\u201d Correa."
