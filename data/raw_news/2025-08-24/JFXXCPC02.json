  "title": "Who Makes Interco Tires And Where Are They Made?",
  "description": "Interco Tires is a family-owned business that manufactures its own tires out of Louisiana, although a small portion of its products are made overseas.",
  "content": "The largest tire companies tend to have a global presence, with manufacturing plants scattered around the world. For instance, Michelin tires are made in the U.S., as well as in Brazil, France, and Japan. In this market, there is no shortage of major tire brands fighting to offer the most competitively priced options for commuters out there. That's why Interco Tires smartly decided to target a specific audience. Primarily, Interco produces a wide range of performance and off-roading tires and even lays claim to producing the first-ever truck tire way back in 1968. This was the L78-15 Swamper, and it's still available today by special order.\n\nInterco continued to build upon these humble beginnings. Today, it boasts more than 500 unique tire models and over 20 unique tread patterns. Interco Tires actually produces the largest selection of specialty light truck tires in the world, which is no small feat for a company of this size. In addition to truck tires, the brand also produces almost 175 distinct models of ATV/UTV tires, with 17 different tread patterns available. Nearly all of these offerings are made in the company's home offices in Louisiana.",

      "text": "Where Are Michelin Tires Made?\nGourmets are most familiar with Michelin as distributors of those coveted restaurant stars, but keen drivers will know Michelin as one of the biggest names in the tire business. Ghostbusters fans will know the brand as the one that has a mascot similar to the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man, but regardless of the context, people tend to know the brand.\nMichelin topped SlashGear's ranking of the best tire manufacturers of 2024. It also appears prominently on sales charts, with the Financial Times reporting that the brand achieved an extraordinary \u20ac3.6 billion (around $3.9 billion) in segment operating income in 2023. Many drivers, though, will be happily traveling on Michelin tires on simple brand recognition, never seeing the need to dig deeper to learn more about how those tires came to be on their vehicles.\nTo learn more about what's beneath the surface of the brand's incredible success in the market, we're going to learn who owns the brand and where those famous tires that outfit a huge range of vehicles from planes to construction heavyweights, as well as cars and trucks, are made. It's a huge global operation with bases all over the planet. More than 70 of them, in fact, including offices for research and development as well as manufacturing facilities. Let's see exactly where these tires are made, who owns Michelin tires, and what some of the company's core locations around the world are responsible for.\nWho owns Michelin tires?\nThe Michelin company is a core pillar of the Michelin Group, or Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des \u00c9tablissements Michelin to its friends. The Michelin Group also has a range of other properties beneath its wide umbrella. These include several companies that are established names in the tire trade, such as Kl\u00e9ber, the first brand the company purchased in 1981. Almost a decade later, in 1990, Uniroyal-Goodrich joined the family too. This incredibly significant deal, The New York Times reported in September 1989, was one worth approximately $1.5 billion. It was a joining of forces that represented, as the newspaper put it, \"a deal that will create the world's largest tire company.\"\nThis was followed by the addition of more subsidiaries, and the company now owns a sizable portfolio of big names in the auto industry. Another subsidiary is Fenner Precision Polymers. First and foremost, though, the Michelin group is known for its own branded tires, meaning that Michelin itself owns the brand.\nThe formidable French brand continues to occupy the upper heights of the pecking order, challenged by the likes of the U.S. brand Goodyear and the Japanese giant that is Bridgestone, makers of those special Blizzak tires. In February 2024, CNN reported that Michelin's output totals almost 200 million tires of various types annually. This feat requires a sophisticated logistics chain and a web of worldwide factories, as well as developing much more than just passenger car tires.\nMichelin tires in the United States and the Americas\nIn the United States, Michelin North America, Inc. has its biggest presence in South Carolina. The Palmetto State houses seven different Michelin facilities, including a Spartanburg plant dedicated to creating tires for heavier vehicles like buses and trucks and two more in Lexington and Greenville that manufacture those for smaller vehicles. Six other states have Michelin facilities.\nIn North Carolina, Asheboro and Norwood plants produce rubber and the necessary materials for retreading tires and airplane tires, respectively. Passenger tires are also produced at plants in Oklahoma and Alabama.\nIn November 2023, the Oklahoma Business Voice announced that the state's Ardmore facility was set to be closed. The outlet quoted Michelin's Editorial Content Director Eric Bruner as stating, \"Unfortunately, this site is not equipped to make the tires that we need at competitive cost to meet the future market demands.\" Previously that year, Michelin North America had 40 U.S. facilities and a further 10 in Canada, primarily including a prominent Nova Scotia plant developing earthmover and heavy truck tires. Its Canadian HQ is in Quebec's Laval.\nIn South America, Michelin has had plants in Brazil for almost a century. Though its S\u00e3o Paulo office opened back in 1927, it wasn't until 1981 that a production plant opened there. This was the Rio De Janeiro facility, and it too produces heavy-duty tires for heftier vehicles on the world's roads.\nWhere are Michelin tires made domestically?\nBrothers Andr\u00e9 and \u00c9douard Michelin founded the company in 1889, in the French town of Clermont-Ferrand. Almost a century and a half has passed since the enterprising brothers began their vehicular odyssey, but the company's global headquarters remains in the town.\nIn total, there are 19 different Michelin factories and offices across France, from research bases to manufacturing facilities and those exclusively focused on tire retreading. The charming town of Clermont-Ferrand alone boasts the Michelin Group's European Research Center, plus a manufacturing plant where a staff of 700 develop the textile reinforcements and molds needed for Michelin's products. The Cataroux site is the home of a Michelin museum and the production of \"metallic reinforcements and semi-finished products,\" per Michelin. This is one of the oldest of the brand's French locations, having been built in 1921. Clermont-Ferrand also hosts Chantemerle's vast Michelin distribution center, as well as storage of stock and other products (including high-performance tires).\nThen, of course, there's the brand's nerve center itself, that famous headquarters. All in all, Clermont-Ferrand continues to be a town vital to Michelin's operations. France, more broadly, is pivotal too. The Bourges factory nestled in the middle of the European nation contains the brand's European Center for Aircraft Tire Retreading, as well as being pivotal to Michelin's aircraft tire production (because tires are about so much more than just cars and trucks). Meanwhile, Roanne boasts a factory that manufactures Ultra High Performance motor vehicle ties.\nMichelin's European presence\nWhen Michelin initially branched out from its native France, the company didn't stray too far. Its first non-domestic plant was created for its European neighbor, Italy, in Turin. Completed in 1906, this milestone marked the company as an international enterprise for the first time.\nOver a century later, there's something very important to bear in mind about Michelin's various facilities: Their output can be very different. Some big vehicle manufacturers might have very different models in production at the same time at the same factory, but in Michelin's own words, \"each Michelin factory is a specialist.\" As such, the company has a heavy presence in Europe in particular, but each might develop very different tires from the next.\nMichelin's plant in Valladolid, Spain, opened in 1973. It was created primarily to manufacture tires for hefty agricultural vehicles such as combine harvesters. It's a role the plant continues to fulfill over 50 years later. The brand already had three other facilities in the country, the first of which opened in Lasarte, in the very north of Spain. This venerable facility, which marked 90 years of production in 2024, served as a multi-purpose producer of various types of tires for several decades of its life, before emerging as a heavyweight of one particular variety: premium motorcycle tires. So critical is the plant to Michelin's global output of such, in fact, that most of its considerable output is exported to other countries.\nMichelin's factories in Asia and beyond\nMeanwhile, in the East, Michelin has a considerable presence in Asia. In Japan, Ota City in the wider Tokyo Metropolis, has been the setting for a Michelin factory since 1991. One particular plant was closed in 2010, with just-auto.com (via Autoevolution) quoting Michelin at the time that it was committed to \"continue to develop its operations and expand its presence in Japan and the Asia Pacific region, notably through its research and development programs in Ota, its sales operations throughout the country and its activities at Nihon Michelin Tire Co Ltd. headquarters in Tokyo.\"\nIn the United Kingdom, Michelin's enterprise revolves around the West Midlands city of Stoke-on-Trent. Known for its industrial history, it's perfect for a regional HQ and another facility for retreading tires, this time for trucks. The city even hosts the Michelin Training and Information Center, which provides courses for staff on a range of auto topics, from balancing tires to negotiation techniques for management staff.\nIn India, the Michelin Technology Center is another important outlet for the company. Its focus is on developing the materials used in the making of tires for larger road vehicles.\nExpanding into Africa\nAround the middle of the 20th century, Michelin expanded into Africa. Johannesburg's South Africa facility has existed since 1943, and it was in the late 1950s and early 1960s that Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Moderne du Pneumatique Camerounais (in Cameroon's city of Douala) and Michelin Tyre Services (in Nigeria's city of Lagos) were founded.\nAs in any region, though, Michelin faced its share of challenges on the continent. Historically, Nigeria has hosted its share of tire manufacture, but the company was forced to change tack there in response to what Chioma Alonge, first female Managing Director of Michelin Nigeria, described as \"an unfavorable operating environment, power issues and insecurity.\" Speaking to This Day in 2023, Alonge remembered, \"we had our manufacturing plant in Port Harcourt with Lagos as the commercial headquarters.\" The latter had to close in 2007, she explained, as a result of the country's difficulty maintaining the consistent power that the process of manufacturing tires demanded. The country now maintains an import presence of its tires, as well as a network across the country of facilities focused on distributing and maintaining those tires.\nAs with any of the world's biggest brands, Michelin's operations have changed shape over time, with some of these facilities closing or changing hands. There's no denying, though, that the Michelin brothers' work all those years ago has led to one of the biggest, more influential and versatile business empires in the world. Its airless tires are the sort of automotive technology that could change the future of driving."

      "text": "21 Major Tire Brands Of 2025 Ranked\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nTires are one of the most important and yet most underappreciated parts of your car. Not only is it part of the suspension system and therefore helps dictate the softness or firmness of your car's ride but the tread pattern, materials, and design are also huge factors. For example, summer tires are made for warm weather, and the tread pattern is meant for dry concrete. Meanwhile, winter tires are made from softer rubber with tread patterns that are better in the snow. All season tires are made with rubber that does reasonably okay in both cold and warm climates with tread that works on dry, wet, and snowy roads.\nPicking a right tire requires a lot of effort, especially because there are so many tires out there. In addition to all season, summer, and winter tires, you have specialty tires like eco tires that reduce rolling resistance, and, of course, performance tires like they use in NASCAR. There are also run flats \u2014 also known as self-supporting tires \u2014 that can keep you driving for a limited duration after a puncture so you can make it to safety.\nWith all of these options, picking the correct tire can be difficult, so here are the major brands ranked worst to best so you know at least where to start.\n21. GT Radial\nGT Radials come in on the bottom half of our list. Their big claim to fame is that they are affordable, so if you need a tire and you don't have a ton of money, GT Radials is a decent choice. GT Radial doesn't have as many tires available as some others. Most of the brand's available lineup are winter tires with a small mixture of all-seasons and touring tires thrown into the mix. The Champiro and Icepro lineups are for winter tires while the Touring VP Plus, Maxtour All Season, and Savero models are the brand's big all-season touring tires.\nIn general, GT Radial hasn't gotten the attention from big tire reviewers as other brands, so their overall competency is difficult to gauge. Like all brands, GT Radial has its fans and its detractors. However, the general consensus is that they're better than most low-end budget tires and are better in terms of value than they are in terms of performance. Most customers we could find that have purchased the tire are happy that the tire feels well enough for what they paid for it. Considering you can get these for around $65 to $70 per tire in some cases, they are certainly friendly on the pocketbook if nothing else.\n20. Nexen\nNexen has been around the block a time or two. It was established in 1942 under the name Heung-A Tire Company and it was one of the first Korean tire companies. It has branches all over the world, including in the U.S. It operates in the same general vicinity as GT Radial by selling inexpensive tires that you can pick up in an emergency if you're on a strict budget. The brand sells tires under a couple different model names, including the Classe Premiere, N Priz RH, N FERA, and Roadian products.\nThe company does about as well as you would expect for its price point. Most tires are serviceable in terms of traction in both wet and dry conditions with average comfort levels. In nearly all cases we found, winter conditions and treadwear were concerning so if you do buy these, make sure you're extra careful in the snow and that you get your tires rotated on time.\nSome models, like the Classe Premiere CP671 H, perform better than most of their stablemates while others, like the N Priz AH8, perform worse. In all, the brand is much like GT Radial \u2014 serviceable for its price point, but you can do better if you spend extra.\n19. Arroyo\nArroyo is another budget brand of tires that can give you decent value for your money. They are based out of California and make tires for everything from sedans to buses. In general, there are three main tire lineups for Arroyo. The Eco lineup is mostly for passenger vehicles like trucks, cars, and SUVs. Then there is the Grand Sport, which is Arroyo's performance tire lineup, and the Tamarock, which is the brand's off-roader. There is also the AR series for buses, but you probably don't need those.\nMuch like Uniroyal and some other brands, there is a lack of professional reviews to see how these really stack up against the competition. Anecdotally, people tend to like them for being inexpensive without being terrible, which is a good sign. They are largely considered less premium than the larger budget tire brands like Falkan or Cooper but also cost less than those brands. Like all tire brands, Arroyo has its fans and detractors, but typically, the vibe is that you can do better if you spend a little more money.\nStill, we did find some surprisingly positive reviews for the brand's off-road Tamarock tires, so they might be worth looking into as a budget all-terrain tire. After all, just because they aren't the best doesn't mean that they are the worst, and Arroyo is certainly not the worst tire we've ever seen either. They're decent for tight budgets, but if you can swing it, you'll get a better experience with a more expensive tire.\n18. Uniroyal\nUniroyal has been making tires for quite a long time. The brand began in 1892 as the United States Rubber Company before eventually being purchased by Michelin. Thus, the brand acts as a sort of budget range for Michelin while still making tires under the original Uniroyal name. Currently, the tire maker has four sets of tires. The two that are for cars, crossovers, and minivans include the Tiger Paw Touring A/S and the Power Paw A/S. For trucks and SUVs, there are the Laredo HT and Laredo AT.\nFor the most part, Uniroyal tires are pretty decent for their price range. You can get these tires for under $100 depending on the tire size you need. There aren't many professional reviews so we're not quite certain how they handle road conditions in comparison to other tires. However, user reviews suggest that they're competent overall tires in all seasons in terms of grip but can be a tad noisy compared to more expensive tires. In general, the Laredo branded tires seem to do better among buyers. In short, they appear to be exactly as they are, which is decent budget-oriented tires.\nFor the most part, they'll get the job done. They may not be as quiet or as smooth as their corporate counterparts in BFGoodrich or Michelin, but they also cost less per tire, so that's the trade-off. We'd happily take a set of these over a worn out set of tires from a more expensive brand.\n17. Dunlop\nDunlop has been around for a very long time, opening its first factory in Ireland in 1890. It also has a corporate relationship as of 1999. Today, Dunlop has a smaller selection than most competitors but still enough to cover most types of vehicles. Some of its products include the Grandtrek Touring A/S for SUVs and crossovers, the Grandtrek SJ6 for trucks, and Dunlop's Enasave 01 A/S and Signature II touring all-season tires. In addition, the brand sells a variety of summer tires, which Dunlop calls ultra-high performance all-season tires, that are intended for cars like Lexus and BMW.\nIn general, Dunlop doesn't make a bad tire. There are only two small issues with it. The first is the lack of sizes. For example, neither of the standard all-season tires come in 225/50R17, which is the size my 10th-generation Honda Accord uses. On top of its limited sizes, Dunlop tires tend to test mediocre. Other than the Signature II tires \u2014 which actually test well \u2014 the rest are all middle of the proverbial road per tests from Tire Rack and other authorities.\n16. Firestone\nFirestone has also been around for a long time. The brand started in 1900 in Akron, Ohio, as a tire and rubber company. They've been going strong ever since. Much like Dunlop, Firestone doesn't have the largest selection of tires, but they hit all of the main categories. Firestone's tires include the WeatherGrip all-season tires, Winterforce CV for trucks, and the Transforce CV all-seasons. Firestone also has a decent selection of all-terrain tires for both on-road and off-road use.\nFor the most part, Firestone tires are a mixed bag. Some models, like the Affinity Touring and the standard Firestone All Season, scored mediocre on tests. Others, like the Transforce CV, Winterforce CV, and WeatherGrip all scored on the higher end of average or the low end of good. That means Firestone makes competent tires that tend to do well in terms of comfort, traction, and treadwear, but you have to shop for the top end models to do it.\n15. Hankook\nHankook is a South Korean tire brand first established in 1941. The brand is best known for its Kinergy and Ventus lineup of tires. Each one has multiple sub-variants, including summer tires, all-seasons, grand touring, crossover-oriented, and high-performance tires. Hankook also makes Dynapro and Optimo tires to round out its lineup. Overall, Hankook has a larger selection than Firestone or Dunlop, although many of them are just subtle variations of the same tire, so overall, Hankook's selection is about as large.\nIn terms of performance, Hankook is similar prior two brands in that they're all over the place. The Kinergy GT doesn't do the best in the wet or snow while the Kinergy ST performs above average. Most of Hankook's lineup occupies the middle ground where it performs fine in the wet and a little less good in the snow. That's not unusual for tires in general, especially when they're not winter tires. In all, Hankook is a good brand with some weaknesses, but those weaknesses are fairly common among tires in general. If you need something for snow, you can always get a winter tire.\n14. General\nGeneral has been around for over 100 years, and it has an interesting as history as the one of the biggest tire manufacturers over that time. Like Firestone, it also began life in Akron, Ohio. General has a medium-sized selection of tires and they cover all of the typical bases. Their biggest product is the AltiMAX, which it sells in two variants, the 365 AW and the RT45. It also has a host of all-season, all-terrain, and light truck tires known as the Grabber series, with the Grabber Arctic and the Grabber A/TX being notable highlights.\nThe good news is most of General's tires test very well. The aforementioned four brands all score excellently on multiple tests, including those from Tire Rack. There are a few tires that don't review as well, like the Grabber HD tires. However, by and large, General makes some solid tires and they even come in sizes that fit my 10th generation Accord. General's off-terrain tires are a highlight and their all-seasons are competitive. Even their Altimax Arctic 12 is among the better snow tires out there.\n13. Kumho\nKumho is quite a big younger than some of the bigger companies having only been founded in 1960 in South Korea. Most tire companies have a variety of products in a bunch of categories, but Kumho knows where it wants to be and that's the grand touring tire segment. The company makes over a dozen grand touring tires along with some options in summer, ultra-high performance, and others. Notably, Kumho also makes tires especially for competitive purposes, including track-only tires.\nLike most tire brands, Kumho is a bit hit or miss. Some tires, like the Crugen HP71, Solus TA11, the Crugen Premium, score decent marks and are quite competitive in their respective segments. Others in Kumho's lineup aren't necessarily bad but do score low in some areas. For example, Tire Rack's testing shows that the Solus KL21 has poor winter performance and lower than expected treadwear, meaning they don't do good in the snow, and they'll wear down quickly. It is possible to get a good Kumho tire, you just have to be careful about which ones you pick.\n12. Yokohama\nYokohama is also one of the newer brands, comparatively speaking, with a founding date of 1969 in Tokyo, Japan. Unlike the South Korean tire makers, Yokohama has a finger in virtually every pie you can think of from all terrain tires to all-seasons along with summer and winter tires. There are also plenty of options for the crossover and light truck segment. Yokohama's big model is the Geolandar and Yokohama makes over a dozen variants of that one tire for crossover and car use. The Avid and Advan models are also plentiful and cover summer tires and standard all-season touring tires.\nFortunately, the massive selection doesn't seem to have affected Yokohama's ability to produce a quality tire. Most tires, such as the Avid Ascend LX and Geolandar X-CV are excellent tires and score well against any competitor. However, not all of Yokohama's tires are made of gold, so to speak. The Avid Touring-S and Geolandar G91AV are a little closer to average while the Geolandar G91A isn't great. So, much like Kumho, Yokohama makes good tires but not all their tires are good.\n11. Toyo\nToyo has been around for quite a long time. The brand started as a rubber company in 1945 in Japan and started making tires for automobiles in the 1950s. Like most tire brands, Toyo has quite a few tires to choose from in a variety of segments, including standard touring all-season tires, high performance, off-road all-terrain, and all-season tires specifically for crossovers and SUVs. Of those segments, Toyo clearly has a favorite and it's the crossover segment with about a dozen models to choose from. The main models from Toyo include the Celsius, Extensa, Proxes, and Open Country product lineups.\nToyo is in the same part of the market as Cooper and Falken, so you can kind of guess how this is going to turn out. Reviews for the tires show that they are decent but not amazing at most things. The reviews tend to vary based on the category but for the most part, Toyo sits toward the middle but in the top half of average. Their best products tend to be in the all-season lineups, although their high-performance tires aren't half bad for budget-minded shoppers. You can likely go with Falken, Cooper, or Toyo and you'll mostly be fine. It's just a matter of preference as all three brands tend to be about as good as one another.\n10. Continental\nContinental is one of the top five biggest tire makers in the world. It was established in 1871 in Hanover, Germany and is the first European brand on the list. They have a massive overall selection of tires, including many automaker OEM tires that helps fuel their popularity. Most of their tires are under a few product lineups and they include the ContiSportContact, ExtremeContact, and ProContact. There doesn't seem to be a rhyme or reason to Continental's product lineup. All three major product lineups are present in their summer, all-season touring, and SUV lineups pretty liberally, which makes it hard to keep all of their brands straight. Plus, they're always coming out with interesting tire ideas as well.\nWith such a huge range of tires, it's no surprise that some are hit and miss. Most of Continental's tires put up average test scores with low snow ratings and otherwise average ratings elsewhere. There are some good tires in the lineup, like the Continental CrossContact LX, which scores decent, but not amazing marks. Despite its otherwise average rankings, the Continental ProContact RX SSR is one of the best run-flat tires available for sale, so Continental has that.\n9. BFGoodrich\nBFGoodrich is yet another alumnus of Akron, Ohio, when Dr. Benjamin Franklin Goodrich founded the first tire factory in North America in 1870. The company has a rich history, including being the first tire to win back-to-back Indianapolis 500 races and the brand supplied tires for Charles Lindbergh's first non-stop transatlantic flight. On the ground, BFGoodrich has a decent, if somewhat smaller, collection of tires to choose from. Highlights from BFGoodrich include the Advantage Control grand touring tires, Advantage T/A Sport LT for crossovers, and the Radial T/A high-performance tire.\nIn general, BFGoodrich doesn't have a lot of weaknesses. Their summer tires and high-performance tires don't do so well in the wet but that's pretty typical for the segment. Their touring tires perform much better all-around, with reasonably high marks across wet, snow, and comfort. The treadwear is also better than most, so these tires can last you a while if you maintain them properly. BFGoodrich makes good tires. They just don't make a ton of them, so they may be difficult to find for some types of vehicles.\n8. Falkan\nFalken Tires is best known for its selection of budget-oriented tires, but the brand has done a lot of cool stuff in its time. It started making tires in 1983 and has made all sorts over the years, including racing tires for professional uses.\nIn the consumer market, Falken is one of the biggest players in the midrange tire segment. Their largest competitor in this space is Cooper Tires, and the two trade blows. In terms of selection, Falken makes a ton of tires including the Sincera grand touring models, the Winterpeak snow tires, and the WildPeak lineup for SUVs, off-road, and all-terrain.\nIn general, Falken makes decent tires. Per reviews on sites like Tire Rack, the company does good, but not great in most categories, including traction in various elements and comfort. Every now and then, Falken will make something truly special like the Sincera SN250 A/S, which has excellent review scores across the board. Falken also supplies tires to some automakers, including Jeep, so many folks have already driven on Falkens even if they haven't realized it.\nIn all, Falken is a good brand to go for if you don't want to spend a ton of money but those who want the best will need to go further down the list.\n7. Cooper\nWe'll give you one guess where Cooper Tires hails from. We'll give you a hint: it starts with \"A\" and ends with \"kron\" back in 1914. Cooper's tire selection is mid-sized, but they cover all of the usual variants categories, including all-terrain, grand touring, truck, crossover, and off-roading tires. Some of Cooper's popular tires include its Discoverer lineup, which are mostly for larger vehicles. Its Endeavor and ProControl tires are for smaller vehicles and they're also quite good.\nThe good news for Cooper is that they don't make a bad tire. Each one that we checked scored high marks all around. Most of Cooper's tires are a tad weak in the snow, but they still score higher-than-average marks for it. In short, Cooper is a brand that doesn't seem to have a weak tire in its lineup and its test scores reflect that. Despite the brand's smaller selection, Cooper tires are consistently rated among the best in their class and would be higher on the list if they were present in more categories.\n6. Bridgestone\nBridgestone has taken its turn time and again as the largest tire maker in the world. It was founded in 1930 originally as the Nihon Tabi Company in Japan before being rebranded to Bridgestone in 1931 in the city of Kurume, Fukuoka Prefecture. The brand has a massive collection of tires to choose from, including summer, winter, performance, and touring tires with enough sizes to fit virtually any consumer vehicle on the market. That makes Bridgestone relatively easy to shop for, especially since most tires fall under their Ecopia, Turanza, Potenza, Dueler, Alenza, and Blizzak product lineups.\nBridgestone is a solid brand for tires. Most of their tires score quite well in tests and reviews, with their Blizzak series being some of the highest-rated winter tires that we saw during our research. The brand is far from perfect, with some of their less expensive Ecopia lineup putting up fairly average results, likely to keep costs down. Bridgestone's biggest weakness is its treadwear. It doesn't score poorly by any stretch, but even its best tires seem to have lower treadwear scores than those of similarly rated competitors.\n5. Sumitomo\nSumitomo is one of the oldest Japanese tire makers on the list. The brand started life in 1909 and initially made bicycle tires and tubes before moving on to automobile tiles in the 1910s. The brand has since reduced the number of automobile tires it makes and has one of the smallest selections of any brand on the list. The one you're most likely to run into is the Sumitomo HTR Enhance LX2, which it sells to both sedans and SUVs. It also sells ultra-high-performance summer and all-season tires under the HTR branding along with the Encounter AT, the brand's all-terrain tire\nSumitomo benefits from only selling a handful of tire models. All three of its tires perform well in reviews, with scores ranging from good to excellent, depending on the category. In general, the brand seems to do best with treadwear and ride comfort while its all-season touring tires also happen to do well in wet conditions. Winter conditions seem to be the one weakness and even then, the brand does better than most. So. while you won't see a ton of models to choose from, Sumitomo does better than most brands in terms of making a good tire. They are a tad expensive, though.\n4. Vredestein\nVredestein may not be the biggest brand on the list, but they know how to make a good tire. The brand got its start in 1908 in the Netherlands and is the second European tire company on the list. Of all the brands on the list, Vredestein has one of the smallest selections of tires, but it does have touring all-seasons, summer tires, and winter tires. Most of its tires fall under one of four product lineups. They include the Quatrac and HiTrac for its all-season touring tires along with the Wintrac for its winter tires and Ultrac for its summer tires.\nVredestein scores high marks across the board for nearly all of its tires. The Quatrac Pro+ and the HiTrac All Season tires are considered the best and seventh-best individual tires sold on Tire Rack, which gives you an idea of how good these tires are. It's actually rather impressive since they do well on dry, wet, and snowy conditions while maintaining good overall comfort. The only reason Vredestein isn't higher is because their selection is so small that many vehicles may not be represented. They are also quite expensive.\n3. Pirelli\nPirelli is one of the biggest and most popular tire makers in the world for enthusiasts, but it also makes good everyday tires as well. The brand was founded in Italy in 1872 and have been making tires ever since. It's also known for being the only tire used by Formula 1 drivers. For us normal drivers, Pirelli has a decent selection of tires to choose from. Like most tire makers, Pirelli sells most of its tires under a small assortment of product lineups, including the P7, P Zero, Cinturato, and Scorpion. For consumer vehicles, you'll most likely run into the P7 and Scorpion products.\nPirelli makes a great tire. Every tire we checked scored excellently in all categories. It's not the best tire in the world for snow but even the Scorpion AS Plus 3 tires have a better-than-average snow score. Pirelli also has the distinction of having an excellent touring tire and an excellent run-flat tire in the Pirelli Cinturato P7 All Season Run Flat. In short, there are no bad decisions for Pirelli tires but they do tend to run more expensive than most.\n2. Goodyear\nGoodyear is one of the most popular tire brands in the world, and easily one of the top four tire makers. It came out in 1898 and is among the many tire makers from Akron, Ohio. As one of the biggest tire makers on the market, there are a ton of Goodyear tires to choose from. Most of them fall under a few product lineups. Goodyear is arguably best known for its Assurance, Eagle F1, and Wrangler tires, which cover most consumer vehicles.\nFortunately, most of Goodyear's tires are quite good. The Assurance WeatherReady tires are excellent with good test results and ratings. The ComfortDrive tire is also quite good with excellent comfort and treadwear, and it is only above average in the snow. Goodyear has some average tires here and there. However, we were unable to find any tires that were considered to be bad. That's quite a feat when you consider how many tires Goodyear makes. Their run-flats are their weak point in their product lineup and that kept them from taking the top spot.\n1. Michelin\nMichelin is one of the largest and most recognized tire brands in the world, largely due to its tire quality and its involvement in non-tire endeavors like the Michelin Guide. It's a French tire brand founded in 1889, and itscollection of tires is quite large, with offerings that include the Defender, CrossClimate, Latitude, Pilot, Premiere, and Primacy.\nMost shoppers are likely looking for the CrossClimate2, CrossClimate2 SUV, and Primacy tires. The reason is because they're some of the best tires for sale today. The uniquely shaped treads on the CrossClimate2 and the SUV edition result in some of the best traction ratings of any tire from any brand on the list. The Primacy MXM4 ZP is Tire Rack's highest-rated run flat tire and the rest of the lineup ranges from excellent to above average at least. In short, it's quite difficult to buy a bad tire from Michelin, and most of their tires last a while too. However, you'll likely want to check out the CrossClimate2 first since it's the tire to get from Michelin right now.\nMethodology\nThere are hundreds of tire models out there from dozens of brands, so we had our work cut out for us. Fortunately, Tire Rack has a consistent rating system that covers most of the biggest and most popular tires. From there, we looked up user and product reviews where we could, which mostly includes tire retailers like Tire Rack, YouTube, and others to ensure that the ratings and reviews lined up with each other.\nOnce we had the data, we organized the tire brands above based on a mixture of test results, ratings, reviews, selection, treadwear, and availability. That's how an incredibly high brand like Vredestein fell a couple of spaces because its availability is quite a bit lower than industry giants. There is some wiggle room here as this isn't an exact science, but the above list should be fairly in tune with what consumers and testers think."
