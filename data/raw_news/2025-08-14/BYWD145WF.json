  "description": "\"Balance of Power: Late Edition\" focuses on the intersection of politics and global business. On today's show, Retired US Army General Wesley Clark, Former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe, discusses the potential risks that can result from President Trump's and President Putin's meeting. Kitty Richards, Senior Fellow at the Groundwork Collaborative, discusses the US producer price index showing prices climbing the most in three years as President Trump claims inflation is down to a perfect number.

  "content": "> > THIS IS \"BALANCE OF POWER,\" LIVE FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. JOE: FROM BLOOMBERG'S WASHINGTON, D.C. STUDIOS, WELCOME TO \"BALANCE OF POWER.\" TONIGHT, 24 HOURS BEFORE MEETING WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN, THE PRESIDENT LAYS THE STAKES OF THE SUMMIT. > > WE HAVE A MEETING WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN TOMORROW, I THINK IT WILL BE A GOOD MEETING BUT THE MORE IMPORTANT MEETING WILL BE THE SECOND MEETING. WE WILL HAVE A MEETING WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN, PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY, MYSELF AND MAYBE SOME OF THE EUROPEAN LEADERS, MAYBE NOT. JOE: PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNALING A TOUGH STANCE WITH PUTIN, WHILE INDICATING AN IMMEDIATE CEASE-FIRE IN THE WAR IN UKRAINE IS NOT A GIVEN. WE WILL HAVE MORE AS WE LOOK AHEAD. PLUS, OUR EXCLUSIVE, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IN TALKS WITH INTEL TO HAVE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT POSSIBLY TAKE A STAKE IN THE CHIPMAKER. MORE ON THAT STORY THAT HELPED THE COMPANY'S MARKET CAP DUMP BEFORE THE CLOSE. HAS INFLATION FINALLY HIT? PRICES RISING UNEXPECTEDLY THE MOST IN THREE YEARS. WHAT THE LATEST REPORT SAYS ABOUT THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY AS THE PRESIDENT SPEAKS BEFORE THE NATION TO TOUT HIS TAX BILL'S IMPACT ON SOCIAL SECURITY MORE THAN A MONTH SINCE ITS PASSAGE. AN ILLINOIS COURT REJECTING A BID TO ARREST FLEEING DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS AS THE FIGHT OVER REDISTRICTING CONTINUES. WHAT COMES NEXT. THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR PUTS THE ISSUE FRONT AND CENTER, CALLING FOR A SPECIAL ELECTION IN NOVEMBER. > > WE ARE GIVING THE PEOPLE OF THIS STATE THE POWER TO SAVE DEMOCRACY. NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT ACROSS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. I HOPE WE ARE WAKING UP TO THIS REALITY. JOE: WE WILL HAVE OUR REPORTERS COVERING IT ALL FROM WASHINGTON TO SAN FRANCISCO. WE BEGIN ON THE EVE OF A POTENTIALLY HISTORIC SUMMIT BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID WHAT WE COULD SEE THIS TIME TOMORROW NIGHT. > > WE HAVE A MEETING WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN TOMORROW AND I THINK IT WILL BE A GOOD MEETING BUT THE MORE IMPORTANT MEETING WILL BE THE SECOND MEETING, A MEETING WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN, PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY, MYSELF AND MAYBE WE WILL BRING SOME OF THE EUROPEAN LEADERS ON, MAYBE NOT. WE WILL SEE WHAT HAPPENS. I THINK PRESIDENT PUTIN WILL MAKE PEACE. I THINK PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY WILL MAKE PEACE. WE WILL SEE IF THEY CAN GET ALONG AND IF THEY CAN IT WILL BE GREAT. JOE: FOR MORE, WE TURN TO KATE SULLIVAN, WHO JOINS US LIVE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. THE PRESIDENT WILL BE WHEELS UP TOMORROW MORNING ON HIS WAY TO ALASKA. TELL US WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE WAY THIS WILL UNFOLD OPTICALLY, THESE MEN IN A ROOM TOGETHER, PRESUMABLY ON THE BASE IN ALASKA. WE UNDERSTAND A BILATERAL NEWS CONFERENCE AFTERWARD. THE PRESIDENT PROJECTING OPTIMISM BY SCHEDULING THAT? KATE: ABSOLUTELY. WE HAVE MORE DETAILS ABOUT WHAT TOMORROW WILL LOOK LIKE. AS YOU MENTIONED, A DAYTRIP FOR THE PRESIDENT, HE WILL LEAVE TOMORROW MORNING AND RETURN AFTER THE TALKS. IT WILL START WITH A ONE-ON-ONE MEETING BETWEEN TRUMP AND PUTIN. AFTER THAT WE WILL SEE A BILATERAL LUNCH WITH ARCHER DELEGATIONS. MANY MORE PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THOSE TALKS. AS YOU MENTIONED, IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT AT THE END OF THESE DISCUSSIONS, WE ARE EXPECTED TO SEE TRUMP AND PUTIN APPEAR TOGETHER AT A JOINT NEWS CONFERENCE. THIS IS ACCORDING TO THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY. IT DEPENDS ON HOW THE TALKS GO. WE'VE HEARD A LOT FROM TRUMP DOWNPLAYING EXPECTATIONS, SAYING HE COULD WALK AWAY ANY MOMENT. HE SAID ON FOX RADIO HE THOUGHT THERE WAS A TOY FOR PERCENT CHANCE THE TALKS WERE UNSUCCESSFUL TOMORROW. WE WILL BE WATCHING THE NEWS CONFERENCE VERY CLOSELY TO SEE WHAT GAINS IF ANY ARE MADE OVER THE WHARTON UKRAINE. JOE: PRETTY REMARKABLE TO PREPARE FOR WHAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE. DO WE HAVE A SENSE ON TIMING? IT SHOULD BE AROUND THIS TIME THEY ARE MEETING TOMORROW. KATE: THAT'S RIGHT. WE ARE EXPECTING THE NEWS CONFERENCE TO TAKE PLACE IN THE EVENING. THE TIMING IS STILL A LITTLE FLUID I THINK AS THEY FIGURE THINGS OUT. THE FACT THIS SUMMIT IS TAKING PLACE IS HISTORIC. IT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT IS STEPPING FOOT ON U.S. SOIL IN 10 YEARS. IT'S THE FIRST TIME TRUMP AND PUT IN OUR MEETING IN PERSON SINCE TRUMP TOOK OFFICE FOR A SECOND TERM. THE FIRST TIME THEY ARE MEETING SINCE RUSSIA INVADED UKRAINE IN 2022. VERY IMPORTANT, THE LAST TIME THESE LEADERS HAD A JOINT CONFERENCE TOGETHER WAS IN 2018 IN HELSINKI AND TRUMP CITED -- SIDED WITH THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT OVER INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016 ELECTION. EUROPEAN ALLIES, UKRAINIANS, EVERYONE WILL BE WATCHING CLOSELY TO SEE WHAT COMES OUT OF THIS MEETING BECAUSE OF COURSE THEY ARE NOT AT THE TABLE YET. TRUMP IS TALKING ABOUT A POTENTIAL SECOND SUMMIT. RIGHT NOW IT'S REALLY JUST TRUMP AND PUTIN. JOE: WE WILL HAVE IT LIVE FOR YOU TOMORROW AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU. THE SECRET SERVICE IS BUSY PREPARING FOR THE ARRIVAL OF BOTH WORLD LEADERS. ON THE EARLY EDITION OF BALANCE OF POWER I SPOKE WITH THE GOVERNOR OF ALASKA ABOUT THE PREP GOING ON IN HIS STATE. > > MOST OF THIS IS HANDLED BY THE WHITE HOUSE AND THEY ARE DOING A GREAT JOB. THEY'VE INTERFACED WITH US AND OUR TROOPERS HERE IN ANCHORAGE. THE VAST MAJORITY IS BEING HANDLED BY THE WHITE HOUSE. WE ARE IN THE HEIGHT OF TOURIST SEASON SO HOTELS AND CARS ARE TIGHT, BUT HAVING THIS ON THE BASE ALLEVIATES A LOT OF ISSUES. JOE: JOINING US LIVE FROM BLOOMBERG HEADQUARTERS IN NEW YORK WITH MORE, MYLES MILLER. GREAT STUFF ON THE TERMINAL, RECIPROCITY IS THE WORD THAT STICKS IN MY HEAD AS THE SECRET SERVICE NEEDS TO PROTECT BOTH OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. MYLES: THAT'S RIGHT, SECRET SERVICE RUNNING ONE OF THE LARGEST SECURITY OPERATIONS ANCHORAGE HAS SEEN AHEAD OF THE SUMMIT COULD WITH JUST A WEEK'S NOTICE, HUNDREDS OF AGENTS, WEAPONS AND COMMUNICATIONS GEAR AS WELL AS MEDICAL EQUIPMENT FLOWN IN. WE HAVE MOTORCADE SUVS ARRIVING ON CARGO PLANES, RENTAL LOTS HAVE BEEN CLEARED OF CARS AND HOTEL ROOMS AT CAPACITY. THE MEETING TAKING PLACE AT A COLD WAR ERA INSTALLATION LESS THAN 1000 MILES FROM RUSSIA, IT IT HAS FORTIFIED GATES. IT'S CONTROLLED AIRSPACE, AND INSTANT ACCESS TO MILITARY USE IT -- UNITS. IT'S THE MOST SECURE PLACE IN ALASKA. MOTORCADES AND TRANSLATORS ARE ON HOLD. ALL OF IT IS BEING NEGOTIATED TO MAKE SURE THE TALKS GO OFF WITHOUT A HITCH. JOE: THANK YOU SO MUCH. MYLES MILLER IN NEW YORK. FOR MORE INSIGHTS INTO HOW EUROPE IS WATCHING TOMORROW'S MEETING, ERIC MARTIN JOINS US IN OUR WASHINGTON BUREAU. THERE WILL NOT BE EUROPEAN METERS AT THIS MEETING OR TABLE AND MANY ARE CONCERNED THE PRESIDENT COULD MAKE AN AGREEMENT THEY ARE NOT OPERABLE WITH, PARTICULARLY THE IDEA OF A TRUTH THAT FREEZES LINES IN PLACE. THEY WANT TO SEE SECURITY GUARANTEES. TO WHAT EXTENT ARE THOSE LEADERS GIVING THE PRESIDENT ADVICE AHEAD OF THIS MEETING? ERIC: THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. WE SAW YESTERDAY THE CALL BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP, VICE PRESIDENT VANCE, AND THE LEADERS OF A NUMBER OF EUROPEAN NATIONS. ITALY, U.K., FRANCE, GERMANY AND NATO. A LOT OF CONCERN, WANTING TO MAKE SURE WHATEVER AGREEMENT PRESIDENT TRUMP SHOULD REACH IN WHATEVER UNDERSTANDING HE SHOULD REACH WITH PRESIDENT PUTIN TOMORROW INCLUDES THE ABILITY OF UKRAINE TO DEFEND ITSELF IN THE FUTURE. SOME COUNTRIES IN EUROPE HAVE SUPPORTED UKRAINE JOINING NATO. THIS IS A POSITION THAT COME OUT WITH IN THE PAST YEAR. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR COUNTRIES IN WESTERN EUROPE THAT UKRAINE BE ABLE TO DEFEND ITSELF , THE SOVEREIGN AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF UKRAINE VERY HIGH IN THE MINDS OF EUROPEAN LEADERS. JOE: PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS INDICATED HE WILL BRIEF EUROPEAN LEADERS AFTER THE SUMMIT. ERIC: THAT'S RIGHT, HE MENTIONED IF THE MEETING GOES WELL, HE THINKS HE WOULD BE ON THE PHONE POTENTIALLY AND COMMUNICATING WITH EUROPEAN LEADERS AND PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE MEETING. IT'S FASCINATING WHAT KATE JUST MENTIONED IN TERMS OF A BILATERAL PRESS CONFERENCE PLANNED. WHILE PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SAID THERE'S A 25% CHANCE THIS WON'T GO WELL, THAT MEANS THERE'S A 75% CHANCE IT WILL GO WELL. I ASKED THE SECRETARY OF STATE EARLIER ABOUT THIS AND HE SAID THEY ARE HOPEFUL THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP TO LOOK PRESIDENT PUTIN IN THE EYE AND SEE WHAT HIS INTENTIONS ARE AND HIS COMMITMENT TO REACHING A PEACE AGREEMENT. EVEN AS THEY REMAIN CAUTIOUS ON THE OUTCOME, SEEING THESE KINDS OF STEPS BEING TAKEN EVEN IN TERMS OF LOGISTICS FOR A JOINT MESSAGE, IT RAISES EXPECTATIONS THAT THERE WILL BE SOMETHING POSITIVE TO SAY. JOE: IS NOT JUST THE 25% ODDS HE SAID ON THE INTERVIEW TODAY, HE ALSO TALKED ABOUT SOME THINGS ON FOX NEWS, INCLUDING THE IDEA OF MAYBE PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY SHOWS UP AFTER ALL. THERE'S NOT A CHANCE HE WILL BE AT THE TABLE TOMORROW, IS THERE? ERIC: WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT IT BUT BUILDING UP THE EXPECTATION THERE WILL BE OF SECOND MEETING IN SHORT ORDER, IN PRESIDENT TRUMP'S HOPES AND ASPIRATION FOR THE OUTCOME OF THIS, IS A REALLY FASCINATING POTENTIAL OBJECTIVE AND GOAL GOING INTO THIS TOMORROW. TOMORROW MIGHT NOT BE A FINAL AGREEMENT BUT THE START OF A PROCESS THAT WILL INVOLVE PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY AND HAVE UKRAINIAN REPRESENTATION TO DECIDE THE COUNTRY'S FUTURE. JOE: WE WILL FIND OUT TOMORROW. THANK YOU. RETURN TO A BLOOMBERG EXCLUSIVE AND STOCK MOVER, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION SAID TO BE IN TALKS WITH INTEL, THE CHIPMAKER, TO HAVE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT POTENTIALLY TAKE A STAKE IN THE COMPANY. IT WOULD SUPPORT THE EFFORT TO EXPAND THE MYSTIC MANUFACTURING. JOINING US WITH MORE IS TOM GILES. DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF THE SIZE OF THE STAKE? I'M GUESSING THE MEETING WITH THE CEO WENT WELL. TOM: A FEW DAYS AGO, PRESIDENT TRUMP WAS CALLING FOR THE RESIGNATION OF THE CEO OF INTEL. WHAT A DIFFERENCE A MEETING WITH TRUMP CAN MAKE. A COUPLE DAYS LATER HE MEETS WITH TRUMP, GOES TO KISS THE RING THE. TRUMP COMES AWAY FEELING IMPRESSED BY HIS INTERACTION, TALKING ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND. THE CEO SAYING THERE WAS SOME MISINFORMATION. THE BACKGROUND BEING IN THE PAST HE'S BEEN INVOLVED IN VENTURE CAPITAL FIRM THAT HAD STEAKS AND A LOT OF CHINESE COMPANIES. HE SAT ON THE BOARD OF CHINESE CHIPMAKERS. FAST FORWARD A FEW DAYS LATER, THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT A MUCH DEEPER, MORE MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND INTEL. IT'S VERY EARLY DAYS AND A LOT OF DETAILS WE DON'T KNOW. THINGS COULD FALL COMPLETELY APART AND GO TOTALLY SIDEWAYS. BUT IF IT COMES TOGETHER LIKE WE ARE HEARING, THE IDEA WOULD BE THE GOVERNMENT WOULD TAKE SOME SORT OF A STAKE IN INTEL. INTEL WOULD USE THE FUNDING TO ACCELERATE, TO SOMEHOW BOLSTER ITS PLANS TO BUILD A BIG MANUFACTURING HUB IN THE STATE OF OHIO, WHICH DON'T FORGET, HAS SWUNG IN FAVOR OF TRUMP RECENTLY. THE IDEA -- UNTIL COULD REALLY USE AN INFUSION RIGHT NOW. THEY'VE HAD A LOT OF STRUGGLES, THEY FALLEN BEHIND TECHNOLOGICALLY, THEY HAVE DELAYED THE ROLLOUT OF THE CREATION -- THEY'VE DELAYED THIS MANUFACTURING PLANT IN OHIO SEVERAL TIMES, PUSHING IT BACK SEVERAL YEARS. THE GOVERNMENT WANTS TO JUMPSTART THAT SO THIS INFUSION COULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE NEAR TERM TO THEIR ABILITY TO GET IT OFF THE GROUND. JOE: THIS IS ONE HECK OF AN EVOLUTION. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE POST ON TRUTH SOCIAL AFTER THE PRESIDENT CALLED FOR THE RESIGNATION OF THE CEO. FOLLOWING THE MEETING, HE TALKED ABOUT HIS AMAZING STORY BUT WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE WILL BRING SUGGESTIONS TO ME IN THE NEXT WEEK. ALMOST AS IF HE WERE FORECASTING THE STORY. TOM: YOU HAVE TO THINK, THERE IS SOME PRECEDENT FOR THIS UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION. HE IS NOT AVERSE TO UNCONVENTIONAL AND SOME WOULD ARGUE LEGALLY QUESTIONABLE RELATIONSHIPS WITH SOME OF THESE COMPANIES, TALKING ABOUT GETTING 15% OF SALES OF THOSE CHIPS BY AMD AND NVIDIA TO CHINA. NOT A LOT OF PRECEDENT FOR THAT. AS OUR COLLEAGUES HAVE WRITTEN, QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER IT'S CONSTITUTIONAL. THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER STORY. THIS IS THE IDEA OF THE GOVERNMENT TAKING A STAKE IN A PRIVATE COMPANY. IS THAT THE RIGHT THING FOR THEM IN THE LONG TERM? SHORT, INVESTORS LIKE THE IDEA. YOU SO WHAT THE SHARES DID AFTER WE BROKE OUT NEWS. JOE: REMARKABLE. QUITE AN INFUSION. INTEL IS DECLINING TO COMMENT ON THE SPECIFICS OF THE BLOOMBERG REPORT BUT HAS ISSUED THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT -- \"INTEL IS DEEPLY COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN U.S. TECHNOLOGY AND MANUFACTURING LEADERSHIP. LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR WITH THE TRUMP AND MINISTRATION TO ADVANCE THE SHARE PRIORITIES BUT WE WILL NOT COMMENT ON RUMORS OR SPECULATION.\" TOM, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND REPORTING. COMING UP, PRESIDENT TRUMP TOUTING THE SUCCESS OF HIS TAX LEGISLATION BUT HOW ARE VOTERS REACTING ON THE GROUND? A LIVE REPORT FROM IOWA. AND WE WILL CONTINUE OUR PREVIEW OF THE SUMMIT TOMORROW BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND PRESIDENT PUTIN WITH THE FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER. NEXT ON \"BALANCE OF POWER.\" \u266a > > IF I WERE PRESIDENT I WOULD BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE AN END TO THIS HORRIBLE AND RAPIDLY ESCALATING WAR IN 24 HOURS. BEFORE I EVEN ARRIVED AT THE OVAL OFFICE, SHORTLY AFTER, IF I WIN THE PRESIDENCY, I WILL HAVE THE HORRIBLE WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE SETTLED. IT WILL BE DONE WITHIN 24 HOURS. BEFORE I EVEN ARRIVE AND TAKE THE OVAL OFFICE, SHORTLY AFTER I WIN THE PRESIDENCY, I WILL HAVE THE HORRIBLE WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE TOTALLY SETTLED. JOE: THIS IS \"BALANCE OF POWER.\" I AM JOE MATHIEU IN WASHINGTON, THAT WAS PRESIDENT TRUMP ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL LEADING UP TO HIS REELECTION LAST NOVEMBER. 206 DAYS SINCE HE WAS SWORN INTO OFFICE, HE SPOKE WITH FOX NEWS RADIO ABOUT ENDING THE WAR, SAYING \"I HAVE STOPPED SIX WARS THIS YEAR. THIS WAS GOING TO BE ONE OF THE EASY ONES BUT IT NEVER WORKS OUT THAT WAY. THIS TURNS OUT TO BE PROBABLY THE MOST DIFFICULT.\" JOINING US FOR MORE ANALYSIS IS WESLEY CLARK, FORMER NATIVE SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER OF EUROPE. I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS LEADING UP TO THE MEETING, BUT WHEN YOU HEAR THOSE REMARKS FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL, 24 HOURS, BEFORE I AM IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WHAT IS THE LESSON DONALD TRUMP HAS LEARNED IN HIS SECOND TERM ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN? GEN. CLARK: I THINK IT'S NOT EASY TO END THIS WAR BUT I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ALSO KNOW WHEN PEOPLE SPEAK ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL SOMETIMES THEY MEAN IT MUST SOMETIMES THEY DON'T. JOE: FAIR ENOUGH. WE ARE ON THE PEOPLE OF WHAT COULD BE A HISTORIC SUMMIT. I DON'T KNOW HOW HIGH YOUR EXPECTATIONS ARE, THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN TRYING TO TAMP THEM DOWN. LET'S START WITH THE CONCEPT IN ITS ESSENCE, THE IDEA OF VLADIMIR PUTIN STEPPING FOOT ON AN AMERICAN MILITARY BASE. IS THAT APPROPRIATE? GEN. CLARK: IT ISN'T APPROPRIATE IN TERMS OF CONVENTIONAL DIPLOMACY BUT NOTHING THE PRESIDENT DOES IN THESE DEBTORS IS CONVENTIONAL. HE MAY THINK THERE IS AN ADVANTAGE GAINED BY BRINGING PUTIN ONTO HIS HOME TURF. A LOT OF PEOPLE SEE IT THE OTHER WAY. THE QUESTION IS WHAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE? WHAT WILL COME OUT OF THIS? JOE: IS THIS SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENT IN THE WAR SINCE RUSSIA INVADED UKRAINE? GEN. CLARK: I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT EVENT, I WOULD SAY THERE ARE HIGH RISKS. NOT RISKS FOR THE PRESIDENT -- THAT IS THERE, BUT HE TAKES THOSE RISKS ALL THE TIME HE RISKS PREVIOUS PRESIDENTS WOULDN'T TAKE. HE DOESN'T WORRY ABOUT THAT. THE RISK IS THE RISK THAT THIS COULD JUST COME LATE THE FRAGILE SUPPORT FOR UKRAINE. YOU'VE GOT EUROPEANS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO PUT RESOURCES INTO UKRAINE, UKRAINE IS STRUGGLING AFTER 3.5 YEARS, IT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS NOT REALLY PROVIDING MILITARY ASSISTANCE OTHER THAN WHAT WAS PROVIDED BY BIDEN. THEY'VE SAID THE EUROPEANS COULD PUT MONEY INTO IT. PUTIN HAS BEEN ON THE CAMPAIGN TO TAKE BACK THE SOVIET SPACE SINCE HE WAS PUT IN AS THE PRESIDENT IN 2000. HE IS THE SENIOR STATESMEN IN THE WORLD TODAY. HE HAS MET DOZENS AND DOZENS OF LEADERS. I DON'T THINK WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BUY HIM OFF IN THIS MEETING AND SAY HAVE UP ON YOUR 25 YEAR QUEST TO RESTORE THE SOVIET UNION. HAVE GOOD RELATIONS WITH ME, PRESIDENT TRUMP. I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO TURN THE TIDE. IT SEEMS UNLIKELY. JOE: WHEN WE CONSIDER POTENTIAL OUTCOMES TOMORROW, I SPOKE YESTERDAY WITH THE FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO POLAND, HERE'S WHAT HE SUGGESTED ABOUT PRESIDENT TRUMP PROPOSING IN TERMS OF A TRUCE DURING THIS SUMMIT. > > THE TRICK IS TO AGREE ON A CEASE FIRE LINE THAT'S NOT A PERMANENT INTERNATIONAL BORDER. YOU DO SOMETHING THAT'S A CEASE FIRE LINE, IT GIVES RUSSIA SOMETHING, THEY KEEP THE TERRITORIES THEY ARE OCCUPYING BUT YOU DON'T ASK ZELENSKYY OR THE UKRAINIANS TO AGREE TO IT PERMANENTLY. HE GETS THIS, A CEASE FIRE IN PLACE, HE DESERVES IT. THE OTHER HALF IS SECURITY FOR UKRAINE. JOE: IS THE AMBASSADOR ONTO SOMETHING? AN ARMISTICE, IS THAT A TEMPORARY SOLUTION? GEN. CLARK: IT'S DIPLOMATIC SPEAK. THE TRUTH IS MR. PUTIN IS GOING TO DO WHATEVER IS IN HIS INTEREST. IF HE BELIEVES HE NEEDS A PAUSE IN THE FIGHTING, IF HE COULD DO SOMETHING THAT WOULD KEEP THE UKRAINIAN DRONES AWAY FROM HIS PETROCHEMICAL COMPLEXES AND MUNITIONS PLANTS WHILE HE TEMPORARILY CATCHES HIS BREATH, MOVES HIS STOCKPILES FORWARD, RECRUITS ANOTHER 10,000 OR 100,000 SOLDIERS, STRENGTHENS HIS LOGISTICS BASE IN BELARUS, HE MIGHT AGREE TO THAT AND IT MIGHT BE AS HE SAID IT IS. BUT HE WILL DO WHAT'S IN HIS INTEREST. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND GOING INTO THIS. WE HAVE NOT PUT ANY PRESSURE ON HIM THAT WOULD MAKE HIM DO SOMETHING NOT IN HIS INTEREST. WE HAVEN'T SAID WHAT THE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE IF HE DOESN'T AGREE. WE HAVE THREATENED TARIFFS AGAIN AND AGAIN. IT'S NOT JUST THIS ADMINISTRATION. OBAMA THREATENED THEM, THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. IT HASN'T DISSUADED PRESIDENT PUTIN FROM PURSUING HIS AMBITION. THE LATEST NEWS I'M SEEING IS HE'S PREPARED TO GIVE ANOTHER LECTURE TO PRESIDENT TRUMP ABOUT WHY UKRAINE ISN'T A REAL COUNTRY. THAT IS NOT PRODUCTIVE. JOE: THAT'S WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM KYIV. WHAT ARE THE CHANCES WE END UP WITH THE DEMILITARIZED ZONE IN THE DONBASS? GEN. CLARK: I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, UKRAINE CAN'T GIVE UP THE TERRITORY IT'S HOLDING. THESE ARE FORTIFIED POSITIONS AND IF THEY WERE TO MOVE WEST, THERE ARE NO COMPARABLE POSITIONS THAT COULD BE PREPARED SHORT OF THE RIVER THAT IS 150 MILES TO THE WEST. EVERYTHING BETWEEN THERE IS OPEN STEPPE. SCATTERED PATCHES OF FOREST BUT MOSTLY FARMLAND. THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR THIS KIND OF WARFARE. IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE RUSSIANS IF UKRAINE WAS PUSHED BACK TO THAT. I DON'T THINK UKRAINE CAN MAKE ANY AGREEMENT FOR A CEASE FIRE ZONE UNLESS IT'S ALL ON THE RUSSIAN SIDE AND PUTIN WON'T AGREE WITH THAT. JOE: YOU MAKE A LOT OF SENSE. IF I'M HEARING YOU RIGHT, VLADIMIR PUTIN TOMORROW WILL BE REWARDED FOR HIS BAD BEHAVIOR, IS THAT FAIR? GEN. CLARK: THAT IS THE FEAR. IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE HE WILL BE PUNISHED. HE STARTED A MAJOR WAR. HE'S DONE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF DAMAGE. HE HAS KILLED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. HE ATTACKS CIVILIAN PEOPLE AND INSTITUTIONS AND HOSPITALS. NURSERIES AND SCHOOLS WITH IMPUNITY. HE HAS ABDUCTED CHILDREN. I KNOW THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO END IT AND I'M IN FAVOR OF IT, I THINK EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE. THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN BUY THIS OFF AND THINK THE WORLD COMMUNITY IS GOING TO GO ON AS BEFORE, IT WON'T. WE KNEW THE AFGHANISTAN PROPOSAL FOR THE U.S. PULLOUT WAS A DISASTER NEGOTIATED IN THE LAST TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND THAT FELL ON BIDEN TO DO IT. IT'S THE SAME PRINCIPLE. SORT OF LIKE PEACE AT ANY PRICE AND IT WON'T WORK. WE LEARNED IT, IT'S CALLED APPEASEMENT AND IT WON'T WORK. JOE: WORDS OF RETIRED GENERAL WESLEY CLARK, FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER. COMING UP, WHOLESALE INFLATION ACCELERATING IN JULY BY THE MOST IN THREE YEARS. WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE ECONOMY AND PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ECONOMIC AGENDA. THAT'S NEXT ON BLOOMBERG. > > LAST MONTH I SAID ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL AND NO TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY FOR A GREAT SENIORS, HOW IS THAT? NO TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY FOR SENIORS AND TO PROTECT OUR BENEFITS WE'VE ALREADY KICKED NEARLY 275,000 ILLEGAL ALIENS OFF OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM. JOE: IT IS \"BALANCE OF POWER\" ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. PRESIDENT TRUMP EARLIER TODAY TOUTING THE SUCCESS OF HIS NEW TAX LEGISLATION INTO THE POSITIVE IMPACT HE BELIEVES IT IS HAVING ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AS MANY REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS PLAYED DEFENSE DURING TOWN HALL SEASON. JOINING US FROM THE IOWA STATE FAIR TO SHARE HOW VOTERS ARE RESPONDING IS ERIK WASSON. IS NOT JUST THERE TO EAT THE FRIED STICK OF BUTTER OR LOBSTER CORNDOG. IN THE FIELD FOR US. I WONDER WHAT YOU'RE HEARING ABOUT THE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL, TARIFFS AND INFLATION. ERIC: IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BOTH PARTIES TO DEFINE THE BILL, MANY VOTERS AREN'T SURE WHAT'S IN IT, DEMOCRATS ARE BANKING ON THE MEDICAID CUTS, POSSIBLE CUTS TO RURAL HOSPITALS CHANGING THEIR FORTUNES. IOWA USED TO BE PURPLE AND IS INCREASINGLY A RED STATE. THEY FEEL LIKE THE ECONOMIC EFFECTS WILL BE BAD AND THE TARIFFS ARE STARTING TO BITE, ESPECIALLY FARMERS. A LOT OF FARMERS HERE ARE NERVOUS ABOUT THE CHINA MARKET GOING AWAY FOR CORN AND SOYBEANS. EVEN TRUMP SUPPORTERS SAY THEY ARE STICKING WITH THE PRESIDENT FOR NOW BUT THEY NEED TO SEE A DEAL. THEY WANT TO SEE SOMETHING BEFORE THE NEXT 90 DAY PAUSE EXPIRES. THEY ARE NERVOUS ABOUT HOW IT WILL PLAY. I FOLLOWED AROUND TWO OF THE MOST VULNERABLE HOUSE REPUBLICANS, THEY WERE AT THE FAIR TALKING ABOUT ASPECTS OF THE BILL THAT ARE POPULAR LIKE NO TAX ON TIPS, NO TAX ON OVERTIME, BUT THEY FACED QUESTIONS ABOUT WIND POWER, FOR EXAMPLE, SUBSIDIES WERE ENDED FOR WIND POWER, IOWA IS A BIG WIND STATE. THEY HAVE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT RURAL HOSPITALS. STEVE SCALISE WAS OUT HERE. HE SAID THESE AREAS ARE CRITICAL TO MAINTAIN THE MAJORITY. JOE: THAT'S FASCINATING. THIS IS A MAJOR STAGING GROUND FOR CAMPAIGNS DURING CAMPAIGN SEASON BUT IT SOUND LIKE CAMPAIGN SEASON HAS ALREADY BEGUN. ERIK: YEAH, THE STAKES ARE HIGHER, DEMOCRATS ARE IN THE POLITICAL WILDERNESS, THEY HAVE TO WIN THESE SEATS, THEY WERE PROBABLY WIN A SEAT IN NEBRASKA, BUT WITH REDISTRICTING GOING ON IN OTHER STATES THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE THESE SEATS. THEY HAVE STRONG CANDIDATES AND ALL OF THE RACES OUT HERE, THEY HAVE A POPULAR STATE AUDITOR RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE INTO THEY HOPE THERE WILL BE MORE ENTHUSIASM. BUT THEY HOPED THERE WOULD BE ENTHUSIASM IN 2024 AND THEY GOT BADLY BEATEN. FOR FARMERS, THE TARIFF POLICY IS REALLY CRUCIAL. I THINK THE PRESIDENT WOULD BE WISE TO LISTEN TO THEIR CONCERNS BECAUSE IT WILL BE A REAL VULNERABILITY EVEN AMONG HIS DIEHARD SUPPORTERS. MY SENSE IS THE PRESIDENT IS GETTING THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT . I WENT TO THE DEMOCRAT AND REPUBLICAN BOOTH, THE REPUBLICAN IS MOORPARK -- POPULAR BUT WE WILL SEE IF THAT LASTS. JOE: ERIC, IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU AT THE FAIR. LIVE FROM IOWA AS LAWMAKERS TOUT THE TAX BILL AND ITS IMPACT, FRESH DATA SHOW CONSUMER PRICES CLIMB THE MOST IN THREE YEARS EVEN AS THE PRESIDENT SAID TODAY INFLATION IS DOWN TO A PERFECT NUMBER, HIS WORDS. JOINING US TO BREAK IT DOWN IS KATIE RICHARDS, A FORMER TREASURY DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL IN THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. ALWAYS GREAT TO HAVE YOU. IS PRESIDENT TRUMP RIGHT, INFLATION IS AT THE PERFECT NUMBER? KATIE: IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE. IT'S INTERESTING TO HEAR HIM SAYING THAT GIVEN THAT INFLATION IS WELL ABOVE THE FED 2% TARGET JUST AS IT HAS FOR SOME TIME. WE STARTED TO SEE THIS TUESDAY, THE BEGINNING OF THE IMPACTS OF TARIFFS AND THE GENERAL UNCERTAINTY THAT COMES CHAOTIC TARIFF POLICY HAS CAUSED ON THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. TODAY WHAT WE SAW WAS A MUCH HOTTER THAN EXPECTED PRODUCER PRICE READING. THAT'S THE COST OF FOUR PRODUCERS OF THE GOODS THAT FEED INTO THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. THE FACT IS THOSE INCREASES TEND TO DRIVE OF CONSUMER PRICES AS CORPORATIONS PROTECT THEIR PROFIT MARGINS. WE SAW THIS DURING THE PANDEMIC WHEN SUPPLY SHORTAGES GAVE CORPORATIONS THE ABILITY TO HIKE PRICES BECAUSE THEY WERE LACKING COMPETITION. THEY DID SO. WE HAVE SEEN QUARTER AFTER QUARTER OF RECORD PROFITS. WE ARE ALREADY SEEING CONSUMER PRICES GOING UP AND NOW WE ARE SEEING PRODUCER PRICES GOING UP INTO THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THEY WON'T PASS THE PRICES ALONG TO CONSUMERS. THAT SAID, SOME PRODUCERS LIKE THE FARMERS IN IOWA, ARE HAVING A REAL HARD TIME GETTING GOODS TO MARKET, GETTING THE PRICE THEY NEED TO OFFSET RISING TARIFF COSTS. I THINK WE ARE STARTING TO SEE TARIFFS FILTER THROUGH INTO PRICES FOR PRODUCERS AND CONSUMERS IN A WAY THAT'S ALSO DAMPENING THE ECONOMY. WE SAW REALLY BAD JOBS NUMBERS LAST WEEK, INCLUDING REVISIONS TO THE PRIOR FEW MONTHS. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE THERE COULD BE A BIG LAG TARIFF EFFECTS AND THEY ARE FINALLY STARTING TO BITE. JOE: THE PRESIDENT SAYS THOSE JOBS NUMBERS WERE RIGGED. IF YOU TAKE THE ARGUMENT OVER PRODUCER PRICES TO THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY, THE PRESIDENT OR HIS LIEUTENANTS WOULD TELL HIM IT IS SERVICES THAT DROVE THE INCREASE IN PRICES, NOT GOODS THAT WOULD TYPICALLY BE ASSOCIATED WITH TARIFFS. ARE THEY WRONG? KATIE: IF I WERE TO LOOK UNDER THE HOOD OF THE PRODUCER PRICE INDEX, I WOULD FOCUS ON CORE CPI, WHICH IS WHAT THE FED WILL FOCUS ON, WHAT DRIVES INTO THE FED PREFERRED MEASURES OF INFLATION. CORE PPI WAS HOTTER THAN GENERAL PPI BECAUSE ENERGY SERVICES HAVE DROPPED IN PRICE AND THAT'S FOLDING DOWN THE OVERALL HEADLINE NUMBER. ANY WAY YOU SLICE IT, IT'S NOT GOOD NEWS FOR INVESTORS HOPING FOR A FED RATE CUT IN SEPTEMBER. JOE: AS EVERYONE WAITS TO SEE IF OR WHEN PRODUCERS START PASSING ALONG PRICES TO CONSUMERS, I SPOKE ABOUT IT ON THE EARLY EDITION WITH BETSY STEPHENSON FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. HERE'S WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT WHAT COMPANIES ARE CONSIDERING. BETSY: COMPANIES DON'T LIKE IT, LIKE PROCTER & GAMBLE, TO ANNOUNCE AN INCREASE IN PRICES IN SAY SIX MONTHS LATER, WE WERE JUST KIDDING, TARIFFS ARE GONE, WE DIDN'T NEED THE INCREASE, SORRY WE DID THAT. IT COST THEM TOO MUCH IN TERMS OF LOYALTY. COMPANIES ARE SLOW TO PASS ALONG PRICE INCREASES. I THINK WE ALL NEED TO KEEP THAT IN MIND. JOE: IS THAT WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN? WE DID HEAR FROM PROCTOR AND GAMBLE AND OTHER COMPANIES WARNING ABOUT THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN PASSED ALONG YET. WHEN THEY REACH THE CONSUMER LEVEL, WILL THEY STICK? KATIE: IT'S INTERESTING, I HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TAKE. IT'S TRUE THAT SOME COMPANIES ARE TRYING TO HOLD ONTO BRAND LOYALTY, AVOIDING PASSING ON PRICES. OTHER COMPANIES THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE PASSED ALONG COSTS TO CONSUMERS BEFORE THEY HAVE SEEN THE COSTS IN THEIR OWN BOTTOM LINE. THE PLACE WHERE I REALLY AGREE WITH WHAT SHE IS SAYING IS COMPANIES ARE VERY RELUCTANT TO BRING PRICES BACK DOWN AND FRANKLY, UNLESS THEY HAVE STRONG COMPETITION OR SOME THING ELSE PUTTING PRESSURE ON PRICING ABILITY, THERE'S NO REASON FOR THEM TO. THEY CAN CONTINUE HIGH PRICES EVEN IF TARIFFS GO AWAY. THAT'S WHAT WE SAW DURING THE PANDEMIC AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN DURING MOST PERIODS OF INFLATION. JOE: I'M GUESSING YOU ARE NOT MAKING THE ARGUMENT FOR INTEREST RATE CUTS AS THE WHITE HOUSE IS. THE TREASURY SECRETARY TALKED TO US ON BLOOMBERG YESTERDAY, ON BLOOMBERG SURVEILLANCE AND TALKED IN DETAIL ABOUT HOW HE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE FED CUT RATES, 150 TO 175 POINTS. TODAY HE WENT ON FOXBUSINESS TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON HIS FEELINGS. > > I DIDN'T TELL THE FED WHAT TO DO. WHAT I SAID WAS TO GET TO A NEUTRAL RATE ON INTEREST, THAT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY 150 BASIS POINT CUT. I DID NOT CALL FOR THEM TO GET THERE. THE OTHER THING I SAID WAS PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY HAD BAD BLS DATA IN JUNE AND JULY, PERHAPS A 50 BASIS POINT CUT IN SEPTEMBER WAS WARRANTED. JOE: THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THE MARKET WAS BETTING UNTIL YESTERDAY ON A MOVE SIMILAR TO WHAT THE TREASURY SECRETARY RECOMMENDED, REALIZING HE DIDN'T TELL THE FED WHAT TO DO. HOW DID THIS MORNING'S DATA CHANGE YOUR VIEW ON INTEREST RATES? KATIE: IT'S DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT THE FED SHOULD DO. I'VE BEEN ARGUING FOR QUITE SOME TIME THAT THE FED SHOULD HAVE NORMALIZED INTEREST RATES LAST YEAR. THOSE HIGH INTEREST RATES ARE PUTTING THE SQUEEZE ON AMERICANS, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE TRYING TO BUY A HOUSE OR RENT AN APARTMENT. IT DECREASES HOUSING SUPPLY, DRIVES UP COSTS DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY AND FOLKS WHO ARE HAVING TO PUT HIGHER PRICES ON A CREDIT CARD ARE PAYING HIGH INTEREST EVERY MONTH AND IT'S DIFFICULT FOR FAMILY SECURITY. HOWEVER, THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS NOT ADDRESSING ANY OF THE COST DRIVERS AND INSTEAD IS ENGAGING IN THIS CHAOTIC TARIFF POLICY DRIVING PRICES UP. I THINK THAT'S A REALLY DIFFICULT POSITION FOR THE FED TO BE AN, ESPECIALLY AS THEY SEE POTENTIAL BEGINNING IN THE LABOR MARKET BUT REMAIN CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT TRUMP'S POLICIES ARE GOING TO DO TO INFLATION OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS. JOE: WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THEY CUT BY 150 DIPS RIGHT NOW? KATIE: IT WOULD BE PRETTY UNEXPECTED. JOE: IT WOULD. KATIE: I DON'T THINK ANYONE EXPECTS THE FED TO MAKE THOSE MOVES. SO FAR THEY HAVE BEEN IN A WAIT AND SEE MODE AND I THINK THE REST OF US ARE GOING TO WAIT AND SEE WHAT THEY WAIT AND SEE. JOE: KATIE, ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU. COMING UP, WE WILL TURN BACK TO OUR CONVERSATION ON TOMORROW'S SUMMIT BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND VLADIMIR PUTIN WHEN WE ASSEMBLE OUR POLITICAL PANEL NEXT ON \"BALANCE OF POWER.\" JOE: THIS IS \"BALANCE OF POWER.\" MUCH MORE ON TOMORROW SIT BETWEEN VLADIMIR PUTIN AND PRESIDENT TRUMP, COMING UP WITH OUR POLITICAL PANEL. THE STORIES WE ARE WATCHING IN TODAY'S POWER BRIEF. DOCTORS WITHOUT BORDERS REPORTING A GROWING CHOLERA OUTBREAK IN SUDAN, IT COULD TAKE A PROLONGED PERIOD TO ERADICATE. THE MEDICAL CHARITY SAID THE APPLICANT THE REGION, WHICH HAS BEEN HIT BY A TWO YEAR WAR, HAS BEEN FILLED BY WATER SHORTAGES AND DISPLACEMENT. A NEW GALLUP POLL FINDING THAT ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AMONG U.S. ADULTS HAS HIT THE LOWEST LEVEL ON RECORD, ONLY 54% OF AMERICANS CLAIMING TO CONSUME ALCOHOL. THIS COINCIDES WITH THE GROWING BELIEF THAT EVEN ONE DRINK PER DAY IS BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH. THE TREND OF YOUNG ADULTS ABSTAINING FROM ALCOHOL HAS ACCELERATED IN RECENT YEARS. EVEN THOSE THAT PARTAKE REPORT THEY ARE BRINGING LESS THAN THEY USED TO. THE TEXAS GOP LOST ITS BID TO HAVE AN ILLINOIS COURT INTERVENE IN HIS QUEST TO GET DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS WHO FLED THE STATE BACK TO OFTEN. THE COUNTY JUDGE SAYS ILLINOIS COINS -- COURTS HAVE NO JURISDICTION TO INTERVENE. THIS IS PART OF A FIGHT OVER REDISTRICTING THAT WE TALKED ABOUT, HANDFUL OF STATES ARE ALL CONTEMPLATING REDRAWING THEIR OWN CONGRESSIONAL MAPS AHEAD OF THE 2026 MIDTERMS. CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNOR IS SAYING THIS TO SUPPORTERS WHEN ANNOUNCING A SPECIAL ELECTION ON THE ISSUE FOR NOVEMBER. > > THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE, THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT'S HAPPENING IN TEXAS AND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA. I DIDN'T RECEIVE A PHONE CALL FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO THEN GO QUIETLY GOING THE BACK ROOM AND START DRAWING MAPS AND TRY TO JAM THEM THROUGH. WE ARE PUTTING THE MAPS ON THE BALLOT AND GIVING THE POWER TO THE PEOPLE. THIS WOULD BE THE FIRST REDISTRICTING DONE THAT WAY, THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE. JOE: SUDDENLY A STORY THAT IS JUST BEGINNING. AS WE AWAIT TOMORROW'S ANTICIPATED MEETING BETWEEN PRESIDENT TRUMP AND VLADIMIR PUTIN, THE WORLD TURNS ITS ATTENTION TO ALASKA WHERE OFFICIALS ONLY HAD A WEEK TO PREPARE. ON THE EARLY ADDITION I SPOKE WITH THE ALASKAN GOVERNOR. > > A HUGE DEAL FOR ALASKA. IT MAKES SENSE. WE ARE ONLY 2.5 MILES FROM RUSSIA. THE PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA HAS TO FLY A FEW MILES TO GET HERE. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS TO GO THROUGH CANADA. WE ARE CLOSER TO MOSCOW BY ABOUT 2.5 HOURS VAN WASHINGTON, D.C. THE OTHER WAY. IT MAKES SENSE TO BE HERE. JOE: AS PREPARATIONS GET UNDERWAY IN ANCHORAGE, WE TURN TO OUR POLITICAL PANEL. MATT GORMAN, OUR REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST ALONGSIDE STEPHANIE MURPHY, FORMER DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN FROM FLORIDA. GREAT TO HAVE YOU BOTH ON WHAT WILL BE A GREAT PANEL. THE EVE OF THE SUMMIT, THE PRESIDENT TRAINED TO TAMP DOWN EXPECTATIONS. THAT'S WHAT YOU WOULD BE DOING AS WELL? MATT: EXACTLY, WE WILL SEE IF SOMETHING CAN COME THROUGH THIS THAT'S TANGIBLE. THE RUSSIANS HAVE HAD A GOOD SPRING -- HAVE NOT HAD A GOOD SPRING OR SUMMER, THEY'VE LOST MORE LIVES AND GOTTEN LESS FOR WHAT THEY HAVE. WE WILL SEE IF PUTIN IS SERIOUS TOMORROW. I DON'T EXPECT A CEASE-FIRE, THAT'S THE BEST THAT COULD COME OUT OF THAT BUT I DON'T THINK IT WILL BE ANYTHING TANGIBLE. SEE IF PUTIN MEANS BUSINESS. JOE: LOOKING AT A LIVE VIEW OF THE JOINT BASE AND ANCHORAGE WHERE THE TWO WILL BE MEETING AND THE OPTICS WILL BE SOMETHING TOMORROW, CONGRESSWOMAN. WE HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO TALK UNTIL NOW. THE NARRATIVE IN WASHINGTON HAS BEEN THAT THIS IS A WIN FOR PUTIN TO GET THE MEETING. HOW DOES PRESIDENT TRUMP TURN THIS INTO A WIN WITH ANYTHING SHORT OF A CEASE-FIRE? STEPHANIE: I THINK THE SUMMIT COMES ON THE HEELS OF A FOREIGN POLICY WIN FOR TRUMP WHEN HE NEGOTIATED THE PEACE DEAL RECENTLY BETWEEN AZERBAIJAN AND ARMENIA. IT'S AN IMPORTANT SUMMIT BUT I THINK IT'S SIGNIFICANT TO BOTH SIDES ARE SETTING EXPECTATIONS LOWER. YOU HEAR PUTIN SAYING THERE IS NOTHING BINDING THAT WILL COME OUT OF THE SUMMIT. YOU ALSO HEAR TRUMP AND THE WHITE HOUSE SAYING, EVEN TRUMP SAID THERE'S ONLY A 25% CHANCE -- THAT THERE IS A 25% CHANCE THE MEETING COULD FAIL. GIVEN THE HISTORY BETWEEN THESE LEADERS, YOU CAN SEE WHY THEY ARE BOTH TRYING TO LOWER EXPECTATIONS. TRUMP CAME INTO OFFICE SAYING HE WOULD END THE WAR ON DAY ONE. HE HAS EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION ABOUT HIS DEALINGS WITH PUTIN, SAYING MAYBE HE'S JUST TAGGING HIM ALONG. PUTIN FOR HIS PART HAS ENGAGED AND DELAYED, ENGAGED AND DELAYED. CONTINUING MILITARY ACTION WHILE GIVING THE IMPRESSION HE WANTS TO ENGAGE IN PEACE TALKS. YOU CAN SEE WHY EVERYBODY IS TRYING TO SET LOWER EXPECTATIONS. JOE: IMPORTANT NEWS TODAY THAT WE WILL ANTICIPATE, BILATERAL NEWS CONFERENCE AFTER THIS EVENT. THIS TIME TOMORROW WE WILL COUNT DOWN TO THESE WOMEN WALKING OUT -- THESE TWO MEN WALKING OUT. IS IT A SMART MOVE TO HAVE VLADIMIR PUTIN STANDING AS AN EQUAL? MATT: DUE RESPECT, HE'S EQUAL, HE'S ALSO A WORLD LEADER. I NEVER UNDERSTOOD THE LINE OF ARGUMENT FROM SOME OF THE LEFT, I CAN'T BELIEVE HE IS HERE -- HE'S A WORLD LEADER. HE STARTED A WAR WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. YOU CAN STAND ON PRINCIPLE AND NEVER TALK TO HIM BUT YOU CAN'T. JOE: DOES THE NEWS CONFERENCE LEGITIMIZE THE MEETING? IS THE IDEA THAT AMERICA NEEDS TO SEE THESE TWO EMERGE? MATT: PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SITTING DOWN WITH HIM BECAUSE WE HAVE TO, WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO END THIS WAR. I WILL SAY THIS. I THINK IT'S SMART BECAUSE YOU WANT TO SET THE MEETING AFTERWARDS ON YOUR OWN TERMS. WHAT DID YOU DISCUSS OR NOT DISCUSS? JOE: IS THE STORY TOMORROW THAT WE GET TOGETHER WITH ALL OF THE FANFARE TO SIMPLIFY AND AN AGREEMENT TO MEET AGAIN? STEPHANIE: I THINK THAT MIGHT BE A WIN BECAUSE THE EUROPEAN LEADERS AS WELL AS UKRAINE ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT A MEETING THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE UKRAINE AND TRUMP HIMSELF HAS FLOATED THE IDEA THAT A SUBSEQUENT THREE-WAY MEETING WITH THE UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT AND PUTIN COULD BE THE OUTCOME OF THIS INITIAL MEETING. THAT MIGHT BE THE WIN THAT COMES OUT OF THE SUMMIT, IF THEY CAN SAY WE ARE MOVING TOWARD THIS TRILATERAL MEETING AND THAT'S THE PLACE WHERE A PEACE AGREEMENT CAN BE NEGOTIATED, WITH ALL OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED SITTING AT THE TABLE. JOE: A LOT OF TALK ABOUT I CONTACT TOMORROW, WHAT IF LIKE TO BE FACE-TO-FACE, LOOKING INTO THE EYES OF VLADIMIR PUTIN. THE PRESIDENT SAID HE WILL KNOW IN ABOUT TWO MINUTES IF HE'S SERIOUS. WE SPOKE YESTERDAY ABOUT THIS WITH A FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO POLAND. HOW HE EXPECTS VLADIMIR PUTIN TO BEHAVE AND WHAT DONALD TRUMP WILL BE LOOKING AT TOMORROW. > > PUTIN CAN BE CHARMING WHEN HE WANTS TO BE. HE CAN BRISTLE HOSTILITY WHEN HE WANTS TO BE, AND MY GUESS IS HE WILL START OUT BEING CHARMING AND TRYING TO THROW SOMETHING ON THE TABLE THAT LOOKS SHINY AND APPEALING BUT IS USELESS. JOE: PREPARE FOR THE TERM OFFENSIVE IS THE IDEA, HE HAS BEEN IN THE ROOM WITH PUTIN SEVERAL TIMES AND PUTIN UNDERSTANDS TRUMP'S PERSONALITY. THERE WITH TALK ABOUT A NUCLEAR DEAL THAT COULD COME OUT OF THIS, AND ARMS DEAL. WILL DONALD TRUMP COME INTO -- PLAY INTO THAT? MATT: I THINK FREED IS A SMART GUY AND HAS A POINT. THE CONTOURS OF A PEACE DEAL HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS FOR SOME TIME. PEOPLE TEND TO KNOW WHAT THIS WILL LIKELY LOOK LIKE IN THE END. JOE: UKRAINE LOSING THE DONBASS? MATT: WE WILL SEE. LIKELY NATO PEACE KEEPING TROOPS. BUT YOU ARE RIGHT, THE QUESTION IS HOW YOU GET THERE AND IT'S A FAIR POINT. I WILL ALSO SAY IT'S INTERESTING TO SEE THE EVOLUTION OF TRUMP'S RELATIONSHIP WITH WORLD LEADERS. HAD TO STEP BACK FROM NETANYAHU, GOT CLOSER TO ZELENSKYY. JOE: MATT SAYS PEACEKEEPING TROOPS POTENTIALLY IN THE DONBAS S. ISN'T THAT A DEALBREAKER FOR VLADIMIR PUTIN? STEPHANIE: I THINK SECRETARY RUBIO HAS SAID THEY PLAN ON INSISTING ON HAVING TANGIBLE SECURITY GUARANTEES FOR UKRAINE AND THAT MAY BE IN THE FORM OF EU PEACEKEEPING SUPPORT. I THINK AN IMPORTANT PIECE IS THE UKRAINIANS ARE AT THE TABLE WHEN THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT TRADING AWAY PARTS OF THEIR OWN TERRITORY. RUSSIA INVADED A SOVEREIGN NATION AND THEY SHOULD HAVE A VOICE IN WHAT IS EXCHANGED IN THE PEACE NEGOTIATIONS. JOE: YOU ICY ANGRY TRUMP TOMORROW? WHAT'S HIS DEMEANOR? MATT: TRUMP WANTS A DEAL BADLY. AS STEPHANIE MENTIONED HIM A AZERBAIJAN AND ARMENIA, HE WANTS TO CUT DEALS. IS TOMORROW POSITIVE FIRST UP? JOE: HE DOESN'T WANT 2018 ALL OVER, HEARING HE HAS A BROMANCE WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. MATT: HE REALLY THINKS HIS FIRST TERM WAS MARRED BY A DEMOCRATIC OF SESSION WITH RUSSIA GATE AND I THINK YOU ARE RIGHT, HE DOESN'T WANT ANOTHER HELSINKI. JOE: HE'S ALSO BEEN LAYING THE GROUNDWORK RECENTLY TO UP INTO THE NARRATIVE AROUND THE RUSSIA INTERFERENCE IN THE 2016 ELECTION. HE'S GOT HIS DNI TALKING ABOUT BARACK OBAMA AS OPPOSED TO DONALD TRUMP BEING THE ONE WHO GOT THIS GOING. DOES THAT PLAY INTO THE CONVERSATION TOMORROW? STEPHANIE: I THINK IT PLAYS INTO THE CONVERSATION FOR THE FAR-RIGHT MEDIA ECOSYSTEM. BARACK OBAMA HADN'T BEEN PRESIDENT FOR SEVERAL TERMS NOW. IT'S INTERESTING WE ARE REACHING SO FAR BACK INTO HISTORY FOR A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION WHEN WHAT IS ON THE TABLE TOMORROW IS THE RESOLUTION OF THE CONFLICT IN UKRAINE. WHETHER OR NOT DONALD TRUMP HAS THE RESPECT OF PUTIN, OR WILL YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT UNDERSCORES WHAT PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT PERHAPS PUTIN HAS SOME THING ON DONALD TRUMP. I THINK PEOPLE WILL WATCH THAT DYNAMIC CLOSELY TO SEE WHICH ONE OF THESE NARRATIVES THEY FIND EVIDENCE FOR. JOE: GOT IT. MATT AND STEPHANIE, APPRECIATE A GREAT CONVERSATION TODAY. TOMORROW WE WILL BRING YOU LIVE, EXTENDED COVERAGE OF WHAT COULD BE A HISTORIC SUMMIT IN ALASKA. HISTORIC IN ITS OWN RIGHT. ON THE GROUND IN ANCHORAGE WITH A FULL ANALYSIS STARTING AT 5:00 P.M. EASTERN TIME. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON \"BALANCE OF POWER.\" SEE YOU BACK HERE TOMORROW ONLY ON BLOOMBERG. \u266a",
