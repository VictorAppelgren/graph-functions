      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**\n\n1. **Canonical Handle & Sign**  \n   - The draft already states a “modest 1–2 % decline in spx.”  Keep this but add a clear sign: *“negative 1–2 %”* and cite the source: `(FAN5RYW6T)`.  \n   - Add a second handle for the Fed’s policy stance: *“ust10y”* with a sign (+ or –) and magnitude (e.g., “+0.5 % if a rate cut is announced, –0.5 % if a hike is signaled”), citing the Fed minutes or policy article.\n\n2. **Evidence & Citations**  \n   - **Labor market softness**: Cite the article’s mention of “historically weak employment growth in May, June, and July” with `(FAN5RYW6T)`.  \n   - **Sticky inflation**: Provide a source for CPI 2.7 % and core PCE 2.9 % (e.g., a recent BLS release or Fed data).  \n   - **Tariff‑driven price pressures**: Cite the article’s reference to tariffs affecting inflation `(FAN5RYW6T)`.  \n   - **Defense‑sector upside**: Cite the defense article `(O6LHRBLFM)` and link it to a *us_steel* or *us_defense* sector handle with a small positive bias (+0.5 % to spx if defense earnings strengthen).  \n   - **Copper tariff case**: If you keep the reference to the Texas factory, link it to *copper* and *ust10y* (higher copper prices can lift industrials, but the article’s focus is on a Chinese firm benefiting from tariffs; this is a side note and can be trimmed or moved to a “watch‑list” section).\n\n3. **Catalyst Windows**  \n   - **September payrolls**: Define the window (Sep 5 2025) and expected impact (+/– on spx).  \n   - **Fed policy meeting**: Define the window (e.g., Oct 12 2025) and tie to *ust10y* and *spx*.  \n   - **CPI/PCE releases**: Define the window (e.g., Oct 15 2025) and link to *ust10y* and *spx*.  \n   - **Tech earnings season**: Define the window (Oct – Nov 2025) and tie to *spx* concentration risk.\n\n4. **Invalidation Triggers**  \n   - **Strong tech earnings**: If the eight tech names beat expectations, the concentration risk is mitigated; spx could rebound (+1–2 %).  \n   - **Unexpected Fed hike**: A surprise rate hike would push *ust10y* up and spx down (–1–2 %).  \n   - **Inflation easing**: A CPI/PCE drop >0.5 % would reduce Fed tightening pressure, lifting *ust10y* and spx (+0.5–1 %).\n\n5. **Remove Drift**  \n   - Delete or re‑frame any sentences that mention “tariff‑driven price pressures” without a source.  \n   - Remove the paragraph on the copper factory unless you can link it to a canonical handle and a catalyst (e.g., a tariff announcement in July 2025).  \n   - Avoid mentioning “tariff‑driven price pressures” twice; consolidate into one evidence‑backed sentence.\n\n6. **Structure & Length**  \n   - Keep the analysis to 3–4 concise paragraphs.  \n   - End with a clear base case, 1–2 alternatives, and a watch‑list of signals.  \n   - Use bullet points for catalysts and invalidations if space allows, but keep prose tight.\n\n**Revised Skeleton (for reference)**  \n\n```\nBase case: spx will decline 1–2 % over 3–6 months (negative sign, magnitude 1–2 %) (FAN5RYW6T).  \nCatalysts (window, impact, handle):  \n• Sep 5 2025 payrolls – if jobs growth weakens, Fed cuts → +0.5 % to ust10y, +0.5 % to spx.  \n• Oct 12 2025 Fed meeting – dovish tone → +0.5 % to ust10y, +0.5 % to spx; hawkish → –0.5 % to ust10y, –0.5 % to spx.  \n• Oct 15 2025 CPI/PCE – decline >0.5 % → +0.5 % to ust10y, +0.5 % to spx; persistence → –0.5 % to ust10y, –0.5 % to spx.  \n• Oct–Nov 2025 tech earnings – beats expectations → +1–2 % to spx; misses → +1–2 % to spx (invalidates base case).  \n\nInvalidations:  \n• Strong tech earnings (8 names) → spx up 1–2 %.  \n• Fed surprise hike → spx down 1–2 %.  \n• Inflation easing >0.5 % → spx up 0.5–1 %.  \n\nWatch list: Sep 5 payrolls, Oct 12 Fed minutes, Oct 15 CPI/PCE, Oct–Nov tech earnings.  \nConfidence: moderate‑high (based on concentration risk and labor‑inflation‑Fed link).  \n```\n\nApply these edits to ensure every claim is tied to a canonical handle, sign/magnitude, and a dated catalyst. Remove any unsupported or drifted content.",
