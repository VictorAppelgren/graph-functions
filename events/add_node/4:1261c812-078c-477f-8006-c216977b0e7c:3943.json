    "importance_classification": {
      "importance": 4,
      "rationale": "The US Visa Integrity Fee is a policy measure that is expected to influence tourism flows and related economic activity over a medium‑to‑long horizon. While it may affect the performance of travel‑related stocks and broader consumer‑spending indicators, it is not a core, high‑frequency driver for intraday market moves. According to the type guidance, policies are typically assigned level 4, reflecting slower‑moving, supporting topics that are monitored for regime shifts rather than immediate trading signals."
