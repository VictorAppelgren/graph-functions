  "description": "Zohran Mamdani\u2019s \u201cFive Boroughs Against Trump\u201d tour is a cheap campaign stunt setting the stage for disaster for New York City.",
  "content": "Zohran Mamdani\u2019s \u201cFive Boroughs Against Trump\u201d tour makes oodles of sense for him \u2014 but only at the expense of the rest of the city.\n\nNot just because the last thing New Yorkers need is a mayor seeking a war with the White House, since they\u2019d inevitably be the cannon fodder.\n\nMore: Centering the mayoral debate on countering President Donald Trump encourages everyone to ignore all the issues Mamdani doesn\u2019t want voters thinking about, like how to make the streets and subways safe, the public schools functional and the local economy growing.\n\nIt also prevents any focus on his privilege and inexperience, his cop-hatred, his obsessive loathing of Israel and the unworkability of pretty much his entire \u201cpositive\u201d agenda.\n\nTruth is, it mainly appeals to the vanity of his Democratic Socialists and their cheerleaders: Already imagining that their guy\u2019s surprise victory (in a Democratic primary) puts America on the brink of a new socialist era, they now get to also dream of Mamdani somehow turning the tide against Bad Orange Man.\n\nExcept that he can\u2019t \u201cstand up\u201d to Trump (beyond boring bits like the legal efforts to claw back improperly canceled grants that Mayor Eric Adams already has under way).\n\nIndeed, no mere mayor of any city can.\n\nCheck the US Constitution: You\u2019ll find no mention of a mayoral power to check the president, Congress or for that matter the Supreme Court.\n\nAnd in the real world, a Mayor Mamdani declaring war on Trump would entail setting City Hall on fire and expecting the White House to burn down.\n\nNew York City has zero leverage over the federal government, except perhaps 1) Wall Street\u2019s money \u2014 which socialists can\u2019t direct except via their trust funds \u2014 and 2) whatever power the national media has left \u2014 when the media\u2019s already done its damnedest to stop Trump.\n\nThe feds, meanwhile, can screw New York eight ways to Sunday, starting with cutting back on the hundreds of billions it sends our way.\n\nNor can local government \u201cwithhold\u201d New Yorkers\u2019 taxes, as some whiz kids in the Legislature suggest.\n\nState Attorney General Tish James, Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg and a few complacent judges have already waged their worst lawfare against Trump, while then-Mayor Bill de Blasio did what he could against the Trump businesses that remain here.\n\n\u201cTrump-proofing\u201d the city \u2014 the new tough talk from progressives around the country \u2014 is an empty threat, too: Federal law almost always trumps state and local ordinances.\n\nPlaying tough guy and talking big is sure to give Mamdani lots of outraged outtakes for his social media. But he is writing checks that the people of NYC will have to pay.",

  "summary": "Zohran Mamdani's \"Five Boroughs Against Trump\" campaign has been hailed as a good idea for New York City, but it could be detrimental for the rest of the city due to its focus on other issues such as public safety, schools, and economy growth. The author argues that Mammani cannot stand up to President Donald Trump, citing the US Constitution and Wall Street's money as the primary source of influence. He also notes that New Yorkers have no power over the federal government, which can easily control New York taxes, and the media's power. Mamdagnani's tough talk about Trump is an empty threat, as federal law often overrides state and local ordinances.",
  "shortSummary": "Zohran Mamdani's \"Five Boroughs Against Trump\" tour makes sense for New York, but risks inadvertently diminishing the city's economic stability and legitimacy.",

      "text": "Washington, DC\u2019s political class may scream in fury at Team Trump\u2019s takeover of policing, but we suspect most district residents will be relieved: Regular people put public safety first.\nThe city\u2019s politicians have failed to do that, and the feds have a duty to act when the nation\u2019s capital is unsafe.\nEven Democrats have been willing to stomp on DC\u2019s demands for \u201chome rule\u201d when it comes to fighting crime: By a vote of 81-14 in 2023, for example, the Dem-run Senate joined with the GOP-run House to override the City Council\u2019s bid to reduce maximum penalties for violent crime, including carjackings \u2014 and President Joe Biden signed the measure into law.\nCarjackings, for the record, are still triple the 2018 level, part of a grim wave of youth crime \u2014 yet city leaders have refused to get serious about stopping the violence.\nNor did President Trump rush to do this: He warned Mayor Muriel Bowser last year that action was on the table; she\u2019s had six months to turn things around \u2014 but several high-profile recent crimes, including last month\u2019s shooting death of 3-year-old Honesty Cheadle, showed she needs help.\nIndeed, as Trump noted, the US capital has more murders per capita than notorious Mexico City and Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. The homicide rate is six times New York City\u2019s.\nTo drive crime down, this intervention will bring in new resources, including hundreds of National Guard and broader deployment of the federal Park Police.\nNote too: The feds share blame for DC\u2019s high crime. The US attorney for the District of Columbia is responsible for all felony prosecutions in the city \u2014 but Biden appointees to the job refused to prosecute over half of local crimes.\nWe hope neither the City Council nor Democrats (in Congress or neighboring Maryland and Virginia) try to sabotage this intervention. Everyone but the bad guys, and DC\u2019s citizens most of all, is a winner if it succeeds."

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21. Terms Pertaining to Certain Third Party Content, Data and Information Providers and Mobile Application Platforms.\n21.1 AP Material. By accessing the Services, you specifically acknowledge and agree that (i) Associated Press text, photo, graphic, video and/or audio material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium; (ii) No Associated Press materials nor any portion thereof may be stored in a computer except for personal and non-commercial use; (iii) The Associated Press will not be held liable for any delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions therefrom or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part thereof or for any damages arising from any of the foregoing; (iv) The Associated Press is an intended third party beneficiary of these terms and conditions and it may exercise all rights and remedies available to it; and (v) The Associated Press reserves the right to audit possible unauthorized commercial use of AP materials or any portion thereof at any time.\n21.2 Mobile Applications.

      "text": "Zohran Mamdani promises to be President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cworst nightmare\u201d if he becomes mayor, but the actual victims of any such faceoff will be the people of New York City.\nFor starters, no mere mayor, even of America\u2019s greatest city, has the juice to pick a fight with the federal government and hope to come out on top.\nIn fact, it\u2019s a joke to think a Mayor Mamdani could even step in the ring.\nLook: The city depends heavily on federal cash to help the people Mamdani claims to care the most about, namely the poor.\nThree out of five New York City residents are on Medicaid or related health plans, and the feds pay for most of that coverage, tens of billions of dollars a year.\nThe city Housing Authority and the MTA \u2014 both constantly on the brink of physically falling apart \u2014 depend on billions more, both for operating costs and capital spending.\nBillions flow to the city for education, foster care, aid for needy families, school lunch, \u201ccommunity development,\u201d fire and rescue services and other programs that make the city \u201caffordable\u201d for its less-fortunate residents.\nThe Gateway Tunnel Project to build new cross-Hudson train tunnels is underway, with the feds kicking in half the funding.\nTrump quashed this project in his first term, calling it a \u201clocal\u201d matter, and could easily mess with it again \u2014 especially since New York and New Jersey\u2019s \u201cplans\u201d to cover their parts of the bill could collapse under the most elementary examination.\nFederal regulators and administrators can gum up local developments for decades.\nSlow-walked approvals or investigations into environmental impacts, civil rights disparities or labor relations can sideline entire mayoral agendas for years.\nEven money already allocated by law to New York has strings attached.\nTrump\u2019s agencies can perform audits, demand extra accountability, subpoena officials and make things generally miserable for a locality on the receiving end.\nWhat could a Mayor Mamdani do to make Donald Trump\u2019s life a living nightmare?\nBlue cities (including NYC under Mayor Eric Adams) and states are already filing suit against everything the White House is doing, with limited success\nSending building inspectors to find code violations at Trump Tower might be a minor annoyance, but local Democrats have already been gunning for the Trump Organization\u2019s remaining NYC assets since 2016.\nFact is, Mamdani taking City Hall would be a boon to Republicans in the rest of the state and even nationally: an albatross to hang on any and all Democratic candidates.\nThe city will become an abject lesson to normal Americans on the derangement of Democrats\u2019 priorities \u2014 \u201cfree sex-changes for all who can make their way here\u201d is already on the Mamdani agenda.\nThe biggest Dumpster fire of his hapless efforts to turn Gotham into a socialist utopia will captivate the nation.\nA Mamdani mayoralty certainly means nightmares \u2014 but not for Donald Trump."

      "text": "Mayor Eric Adams deserves a cheer for \u201cSubway Safety Plan\u201d wins, but making the transit system truly safe will mean getting a lot more help to Gotham\u2019s seriously mentally ill.\nOn Monday, Adams announced that the city has placed 3,500 onetime \u201cstreet\u201d homeless, including 1,000 pulled from the subways, into permanent housing since 2022.\nIt looks like Adams\u2019 efforts, combined with Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch\u2019s emphasis on quality-of-life policing, are paying off: MTA officials just announced drops in transit system crime, including a 16.7% dip in robberies and a 9.3% fall in felony assaults, comparing July 2025 to July 2024.\nThen again, the subways saw a 19% spike in felony assaults in 2025\u2019s first quarter.\nAnd straphangers still have good reason to be skittish: On Saturday, a screaming maniac shoved a man onto the tracks at the No. 1 50th Street station for no apparent reason; an hour later, another unhinged man stabbed a man in the neck at an East Village station after the two got into a fight.\nThe city has a lot more dangerously unwell vagrants to get out from underground and into treatment, in other words \u2014 and could use continued state reforms to make that easier.\nAdams and Gov. Kathy Hochul won some expanded standards for involuntary commitment this year, but the leading mayoral candidates have other priorities.\nZohran Mamdani even wants to convert subway retail spaces into homeless outreach centers, which would mean more emotionally disturbed people wandering the system.\nForcing unwilling people into treatment sends progressives into conniptions, but true compassion means not letting the seriously mentally ill resist the help they desperately need.\nAdams and Tisch have made some hard-earned strides, but the gains are fragile and unlikely to survive a progressive victory in November.\nIf Adams gets voted out of office, watch for transit crime to balloon again."

      "text": "Mamdani launches Trump-hating tour across 5 boroughs \u2014 and again attempts to tie prez to Cuomo\nIt\u2019s a Big Apple bashing.\nMayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani kicked off a weeklong, citywide rage tour in Manhattan Monday slamming President Trump for enacting policies that he claims are \u201cdire threats\u201d to New Yorkers \u2013 and used the platform to again try to link the Republican to his rival Andrew Cuomo.\nThe champagne socialist was surrounded by former and current pols, including Rep. Jerry Nadler, who piled on Trump, arguing that through his signature \u201cBig, Beautiful\u201d bill that Medicaid, food assistance and other programs vital to city dwellers are being slashed.\nMamdani, 33, also claimed the legislation \u201ccontains such dire threats to the lives of so many that we love and care about\u201d before pivoting to Cuomo, who allegedly had a recent phone call with the president, according to a New York Times report.\n\u201cThese leaders, alongside me, whether in current office or continuing to lead our city beyond those offices, have been on the phone with constituents across this borough, speaking to them,\u201d the Queens assemblyman said at 1199 SEIU headquarters near Times Square. \u201cTrying to speak to their anxieties, their fears, their concerns, about whether they can afford this city, whether they will be safe in this city, whether there is room in this city for them as well.\n\u201cAnd amidst all of those phone calls, former Governor Andrew Cuomo has been having a very different conversation on the phone.\u201d\nCuomo, who is running as an independent after getting trounced by Mamdani in a Democratic primary in June, has disputed that he has spoken to Trump about the mayoral race.\nThe 47th president, who grew up in Queens and long called New York City home, is considering injecting himself into the contest to target Mamdani.\nThe president has consistently slammed Mamdani following his shocking primary upset, labeling him a \u201c100% communist lunatic.\u201d\nCuomo\u2019s campaign insisted the ex-gov would not kowtow to Trump.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the case in Mayor Adams, for sure, but no one has a stronger or longer record of standing up to Trump than Andrew Cuomo,\u201d Cuomo spokesperson Rich Azzopardi said in a statement.\n\u201cTrust me, Trump and the republicans are salivating at the notion of a Mayor Mamdani and will make him the de facto head of the Democratic Party and will run against him in every race across the nation.\u201d\nAdams blasted Cuomo for \u201cturning serious issues into a childish game of \u2018he said, she said.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cNew Yorkers don\u2019t need political gossip \u2014 they need leadership. We have a city to run, not a political scorecard to keep,\u201d the mayor added.\nAdams told The Post he\u2019s willing to work with any president, \u201cRepublican or Democrat\u201d to deliver results for the city.\nMamdani, in his press conference, called the alleged Trump-Cuomo phone call a \u201cbetrayal of the fabric of this city\u201d and argued his other opponents \u2014 Mayor Eric Adams, who is also running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa \u2014 are also aligned with Trump.\n\u201cAnd what New Yorkers want is a mayor who is accountable to them, not to the president, not to the same billionaires that put that president back in the White House, but to the people of this city,\u201d he said.\nHizzoner has faced allegations of a quid pro quo with the Trump administration that led to Adams\u2019 federal corruption charges disappearing, though both the mayor and the White House have denied there was a deal.\nAnd while Sliwa and Trump are both Republicans, the Guardians Angels founder also said recently that the president should stay out of the race.\nMamdani\u2019s Trump-hating tour is supposed to include all five boroughs by Friday as the lefty insisted, \u201cWe know that there is no borough that will be free from Trump\u2019s cruelty.\u201d"

      "text": "Zohran Mamdani\u2019s dreamy, big-spending plans for New York City \u2014 free buses, free babysitting and $100 billion for free apartments \u2014 are about to smash into the hard reality of the state\u2019s massive $36 billion budget gap.\nWhoever is mayor come Jan. 1 will have a hard enough time meeting payroll, much less expanding the scope of government spending.\nNew York has been on a spree lately, much of it funded by once-in-a-lifetime federal bonanza grants tied to the pandemic. But those giveaway days are gone, and Washington\u2019s far more likely to reduce what it sends this way, so both city and state must now face some serious belt-tightening.\nBlaming President Donald Trump \u2014 as Mamdani is already doing with his \u201cFive Boroughs Against Trump\u201d tour \u2014 can\u2019t change the stony truth that New York spends money like it\u2019ll never run out.\nHeck, in the face of federal tightening of eligibility for Medicaid and food stamps, Gov. Kathy Hochul is scrambling to ensure no illegal immigrant gets cut off, even if New York taxpayers must cover the whole bill.\nIt all means less state and federal flowing to Gotham.\nWhich would leave a Mayor Mamdani looking for soak-the-rich tax hikes even larger than what he now suggests to fund his big dreams.\nThe great Maggie Thatcher famously noted: \u201cThe problem with socialism is eventually you run out of other people\u2019s money,\u201d but New York City is on track to run out even before the socialist takes over."

  "argos_summary": "Zohran Mamdani's 'Five Boroughs Against Trump' tour is criticized for distracting from pressing local issues in New York City, such as public safety and education, while appealing to his Democratic Socialist base. The article argues that a mayor lacks the power to effectively confront the federal government, especially given the city's reliance on federal funding for essential services. It warns that Mamdani's ambitious spending plans may clash with the reality of a significant budget deficit, potentially leading to increased taxes and further financial strain on the city.",
