  "title": "Truth Social's New AI Chatbot Is Donald Trump's Media Diet Incarnate",
  "description": "Truth Search AI appears to rely heavily on conservative outlet Fox News to answer even the most basic questions.",
  "content": "When I ask the new Truth Social AI chatbot about navigating bias in the media ecosystem, it gives what I view as pretty reasonable advice.\n\n\u201cDiversify your sources,\u201d it responds. \u201cRely on news outlets across the political spectrum, including those from both left-leaning and right-leaning perspectives.\u201d\n\nThis is advice that the AI itself may not be taking to heart. For instance, to come to the above answer it cites five sources, four of which are Fox News articles. The fifth, inexplicably, is a 400-page report from US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr\u2019s Health and Human Services Department titled \u201cTreatment for Pediatric Gender Dysphoria.\u201d\n\nTruth Social owner Trump Media & Technology Group launched the chatbot, called \u201cTruth Search AI,\u201d on Wednesday. The bot is powered by Perplexity AI, a search engine that answers questions using large language models and live web search. The company has garnered investments from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former Coinbase CTO and influential investor Balaji Srinivasan.\n\nIn 2024, WIRED published an article detailing how Perplexity had been scraping parts of websites that developers did not want it to access, in violation of the widely accepted web standard known as the Robots Exclusion Protocol. It was also prone to making stuff up, a WIRED analysis showed.\n\nWhile Perplexity\u2019s AI draws from sources on the left and center, the Truth Search AI version never cited a center or left-leaning source in dozens of tests conducted by WIRED. In fact, the chatbot highlighted only seven sources in total in response to my queries\u2014Fox News, Fox Business, The Washington Times, The Epoch Times, Breitbart, Newsmax and JustTheNews.com. This was true even for innocuous, non-political questions. When I ask the bot \u201cWhat is 30 times 30?\u201d It sourced its answer from a Fox Business article called \u201cInflation Reduction Act estimated to induce mortality 30 times more than COVID.\u201d Similar tests by Axios and the Verge also show this extreme bias towards conservative media.\n\n\u201cWhat you are noticing is one feature known as \u2018source selection,\u2019\u201d Perplexity representative Jesse Dwyer says when I ask about Truth Search AI exclusively pulling from conservative sources. \u201cSource selection can take any number of forms for any number of needs, from internal documentation within an organization, custom data sets, or, as in the case you describe, domain filtering. This is their choice for their audience, and we are committed to developer and consumer choice.\u201d\n\nHe adds that Perplexity \u201cdoes not discriminate against any developers for any political reasons,\u201d and emphasizes that they \u201cdo not claim their AI is 100 percent accurate.\u201d\n\nThe Truth Search AI seems to be in denial about its own apparent biases, however. \u201cYes, I source information from left wing, centrist, and right wing news outlets depending on the nature of the user's query and what sources are returned in the search results,\u201d it responds, when I ask it whether it ever uses sources from center or left wing outlets. \u201cMy responses are designed to critically analyze and synthesize information from all credible perspectives to ensure accuracy and balance.\u201d This answer is sourced from five Fox Business articles. (The AI seems to max out at five sources per response.)",

      "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s Truth Social has launched a new AI search feature that consistently pushes conservative media sources. The feature, Truth Search AI, is powered by the AI startup Perlexity and is now available on the web version of Trump\u2019s social media platform, with public testing coming to the iOS and Android apps \u201cin the near future.\u201d\nIn our testing, all of the source links that Truth Search AI cited were for conservative publications, including Fox News, Fox Business, The Washington Times, and The Federalist. The vast majority of these links directed users to articles published by Fox outlets, which suggests the Perplexity-powered search engine is limiting results to Trump-supporting media. That\u2019s despite Trump Media\u2019s self-proclaimed mission to \u201cend Big Tech\u2019s assault on free speech by opening up the Internet.\u201d\nA search for \u201cAre Trump\u2019s tariffs improving the economy?\u201d delivered five links to Fox Business, for example, with no other cited sources. The AI summaries are not always friendly to Trump, however. \u201cCurrent evidence indicates that Trump\u2019s tariffs have not improved the overall U.S. economy and are associated with a net negative effect, though some specific sectors benefit,\u201d Truth Search AI wrote in response.\nTruth CEO Devin Nunes said the feature will make the platform \u201can even more vital element in the Patriot Economy.\u201d The search tool is labeled as a beta for now. \u201cWe plan to robustly refine and expand our search function based on user feedback as we implement a wide range of additional enhancements to the platform,\u201d Nunes said.\n404 Media found bias with its own tests, too, reporting that Truth Search AI quickly dismissed that the president was criminally implicated with Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking activities when asked, \u201cIs Trump in the Epstein files?\u201d The bot did, however, say that Trump\u2019s tariffs have \u201cgenerally had a negative effect on economic growth and employment\u201d in the US.\nPerplexity\u2019s chief business officer, Dmitry Shevelenko, said the company is \u201cexcited\u201d to bring the company\u2019s AI to \u201can audience with important questions,\u201d promoting Perplexity as a tool for delivering \u201cdirect, reliable answers with transparent citations.\u201d"

      "text": "Considering Perplexity\u2019s bold ambition and the investment it\u2019s taken from Jeff Bezos\u2019 family fund, Nvidia, and famed investor Balaji Srinivasan, among others, it\u2019s surprisingly unclear what the AI search startup actually is.\nEarlier this year, speaking to WIRED, Aravind Srinivas, Perplexity\u2019s CEO, described his product\u2014a chatbot that gives natural-language answers to prompts and can, the company says, access the internet in real time\u2014as an \u201canswer engine.\u201d A few weeks later, shortly before a funding round valuing the company at a billion dollars was announced, he told Forbes, \u201cIt\u2019s almost like Wikipedia and ChatGPT had a kid.\u201d More recently, after Forbes accused Perplexity of plagiarizing its content, Srinivas told the AP it was a mere \u201caggregator of information.\u201d\nThe Perplexity chatbot itself is more specific. Prompted to describe what Perplexity is, it provides text that reads, \u201cPerplexity AI is an AI-powered search engine that combines features of traditional search engines and chatbots. It provides concise, real-time answers to user queries by pulling information from recent articles and indexing the web daily.\u201d\nA WIRED analysis and one carried out by developer Robb Knight suggest that Perplexity is able to achieve this partly through apparently ignoring a widely accepted web standard known as the Robots Exclusion Protocol to surreptitiously scrape areas of websites that operators do not want accessed by bots, despite claiming that it won\u2019t. WIRED observed a machine tied to Perplexity\u2014more specifically, one on an Amazon server and almost certainly operated by Perplexity\u2014doing this on WIRED.com and across other Cond\u00e9 Nast publications.\nThe WIRED analysis also demonstrates that, despite claims that Perplexity\u2019s tools provide \u201cinstant, reliable answers to any question with complete sources and citations included,\u201d doing away with the need to \u201cclick on different links,\u201d its chatbot, which is capable of accurately summarizing journalistic work with appropriate credit, is also prone to bullshitting, in the technical sense of the word.\nWIRED provided the Perplexity chatbot with the headlines of dozens of articles published on our website this year, as well as prompts about the subjects of WIRED reporting. The results showed the chatbot at times closely paraphrasing WIRED stories, and at times summarizing stories inaccurately and with minimal attribution. In one case, the text it generated falsely claimed that WIRED had reported that a specific police officer in California had committed a crime. (The AP similarly identified an instance of the chatbot attributing fake quotes to real people.) Despite its apparent access to original WIRED reporting and its site hosting original WIRED art, though, none of the IP addresses publicly listed by the company left any identifiable trace in our server logs, raising the question of how exactly Perplexity\u2019s system works.\nUntil earlier this week, Perplexity published in its documentation a link to a list of the IP addresses its crawlers use\u2014an apparent effort to be transparent. However, in some cases, as both WIRED and Knight were able to demonstrate, it appears to be accessing and scraping websites from which coders have attempted to block its crawler, called Perplexity Bot, using at least one unpublicized IP address. The company has since removed references to its public IP pool from its documentation.\nThat secret IP address\u201444.221.181.252\u2014has hit properties at Cond\u00e9 Nast, the media company that owns WIRED, at least 822 times in the past three months. One senior engineer at Cond\u00e9 Nast, who asked not to be named because he wants to \u201cstay out of it,\u201d calls this a \u201cmassive undercount\u201d because the company only retains a fraction of its network logs.\nWIRED verified that the IP address in question is almost certainly linked to Perplexity by creating a new website and monitoring its server logs. Immediately after a WIRED reporter prompted the Perplexity chatbot to summarize the website's content, the server logged that the IP address visited the site. This same IP address was first observed by Knight during a similar test.\nIt also appears probable that in some cases\u2014and despite a graphical representation in its user interface that shows the chatbot \u201creading\u201d specific source material before giving a reply to a prompt\u2014Perplexity is summarizing not actual news articles but reconstructions of what they say based on URLs and traces of them left in search engines like extracts and metadata, offering summaries purporting to be based on direct access to the relevant text.\nThe magic trick that\u2019s made Perplexity worth 10 figures, in other words, appears to be that it\u2019s both doing what it says it isn\u2019t and not doing what it says it is.\nIn response to a detailed request for comment referencing the reporting in this story, Srinivas issued a statement that said, in part, \u201cThe questions from WIRED reflect a deep and fundamental misunderstanding of how Perplexity and the Internet work.\u201d The statement did not dispute the specifics of WIRED's reporting, and Srinivas did not respond to follow-up questions asking if he disputed WIRED's or Knight's analyses.\nOn June 6, Forbes published an investigative report about how former Google CEO Eric Schmidt\u2019s new venture is recruiting heavily and testing AI-powered drones with potential military applications. (Forbes reported that Schmidt declined to comment.) The next day, John Paczkowski, an editor for Forbes, posted on X to note that Perplexity had essentially republished the sum and substance of the scoop. (\u201cIt rips off most of our reporting,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt cites us, and a few that reblogged us, as sources in the most easily ignored way possible.\u201d)\nThat day, Srinivas thanked Paczkowski, noting that the specific product feature that had reproduced Forbes\u2019 exclusive reporting had \u201crough edges\u201d and agreeing that sources should be cited more prominently. Three days later, Srinivas boasted\u2014inaccurately, it turned out\u2014that Perplexity was Forbes\u2019 second-biggest source of referral traffic. (WIRED\u2019s own records show that Perplexity sent 1,265 referrals to WIRED.com in May, an insignificant amount in the context of the site\u2019s overall traffic. The article to which the most traffic was referred got 17 views.) \u201cWe have been working on new publisher engagement products and ways to align long-term incentives with media companies that will be announced soon,\u201d he wrote. \u201cStay tuned!\u201d\nJust what Srinivas meant soon became clear when Semafor reported that the company had been \u201cworking on revenue-sharing deals with high-quality publishers\u201d\u2014arrangements that would allow Perplexity and publishers alike to profit from the publishers\u2019 investments in reporting. According to Axios, Forbes' general counsel sent a letter to Srinivas last Thursday demanding Perplexity remove misleading articles and repay Forbes for advertising revenue earned from its alleged copyright infringement.\nThe focus on what Perplexity is doing is, while understandable, to some extent obscuring the more important question of how it\u2019s doing it.\nThe basics of the \u201cwhat\u201d aren\u2019t in serious dispute: Perplexity is making money from summarizing news articles, a practice that has existed as long as there has been news and that enjoys broad, though qualified, legal protection. Srinivas has acknowledged that at times these summaries have failed to credit the sources from which they\u2019re derived fully or prominently enough, but more broadly he denied unethical or unlawful activity. Perplexity has \u201cnever ripped off content from anybody,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cOur engine is not training on anyone else\u2019s content.\u201d\nThis is a curious defense in part because it answers an objection no one has raised. Perplexity\u2019s main offering isn\u2019t a large language model that needs to be trained on a body of data, but rather a wrapper that goes around such systems. Users who pay $20 for a \u201cPro\u201d subscription, as two WIRED reporters did, are given a choice of five AI models to use. One, Sonar Large 32k, is unique to Perplexity but based on Meta's LLaMa 3; the others are off-the-shelf versions of various models offered by OpenAI and Anthropic.\nThis is where we come to the how: When a user queries Perplexity, the chatbot isn\u2019t just composing answers by consulting its own database, but also leveraging the \u201creal-time access to the web\u201d that Perplexity touts in marketing materials to gather information, then feeding it to the AI model a user has selected to generate a reply. In this way, while Perplexity has trained its own model and purports to leverage \u201csophisticated AI\u201d to interpret prompts, calling it an \u201cAI startup\u201d is somewhat misleading; it would perhaps be more accurately described as a sort of remora attached to existing AI systems. (\u201cTo be clear, while Perplexity does not train foundation models, we are still an AI company,\u201d Srinivas tells WIRED.)\nIn theory, Perplexity\u2019s chatbot shouldn\u2019t be able to summarize WIRED articles, because our engineers have blocked its crawler via our robots.txt file since earlier this year. This file instructs web crawlers on which parts of the site to avoid, and Perplexity claims to respect the robots.txt standard. WIRED\u2019s analysis found that in practice, though, prompting the chatbot with the headline of a WIRED article or a question based on one will usually produce a summary appearing to recapitulate the article in detail.\nEntering the headline of this exclusive into the chatbot\u2019s interface, for example, produces a four-paragraph block of text laying out the basic information that Keanu Reeves and the science fiction writer China Mi\u00e9ville have collaborated on a novel, seemingly complete with telling details. \u201cDespite his initial apprehension about the potential collaboration, Reeves was enthusiastic about working with Mi\u00e9ville,\u201d the text reads; this is followed by a gray circle which, when moused over, provides a link to the article. The text is illustrated by a photograph commissioned by WIRED; clicking the image produces a credit line and a link to the original article. (WIRED\u2019s records show that Perplexity has directed six users to the article since its publication.)\nSimilarly, asking Perplexity \u201cAre some cheap wired headphones actually using Bluetooth?\u201d yields what appears to be a two-paragraph summary of this WIRED story, accompanied by the art that originally ran with it. \"Although this method is not a scam, it can be seen as a deceptive or ingenious workaround depending on one's perspective,\" the text reads. This is closer to WIRED copy (\u201dIs it a scam? Technically no\u2014but depending on your point of view, there's either deception going on here or some kind of ingenious hack,\u201d wrote staff writer Boone Ashworth) than either a human editor or lawyer might prefer, but the chatbot generates text insisting this is a mere coincidence.\n\u201cNo, I did not plagiarize the phrase,\u201d reads text generated by the chatbot in response to a prompt given by a WIRED reporter. \u201cThe similarity in wording is coincidental and reflects the common language used to describe such a nuanced situation.\u201d How the common language is defined is unclear\u2014aside from product listings for headphones, the only sources Perplexity cites here are the WIRED article and a Slashdot discussion of it.\nFindings by Robb Knight, the developer, and a subsequent WIRED analysis suggest an explanation for some of what\u2019s happening here: In brief, Perplexity is scraping websites without permission.\nAs Knight explains it, in addition to forbidding AI bots from the servers of Macstories.net, a site on which he works, by utilizing a robots.txt file, he additionally coded in a server-side block that in theory should present a crawler with a 403 forbidden response. He then put up a post describing how he had done this and asked the Perplexity chatbot to summarize it, yielding \u201ca perfect summary of the post including various details that they couldn't have just guessed.\u201d\n\u201cSo,\u201d he asked, reasonably, \u201cwhat the fuck are they doing?\u201d\nKnight investigated his server logs and found that Perplexity had apparently ignored his robots.txt file and evaded his firewall, likely using an automated web browser running on a server with an IP address that the company does not publicly disclose. \"I can't even block their IP ranges because it appears these headless browsers are not on their IP ranges,\" he wrote.\nWIRED was able to confirm that a server at the IP address Knight observed\u201444.221.181.252\u2014will, on demand, visit and download webpages when a user asks Perplexity about the webpage, regardless of what the site\u2019s robots.txt says. According to an analysis of Cond\u00e9 Nast system logs by our company\u2019s engineers, it's likely this IP address has accessed the company\u2019s content thousands of times without permission.\nScraping websites that have asked not to be scraped may in some circumstances expose a company or an individual to legal risk, though the relevant case law is ambiguous and generally on the side of those accessing public websites. (\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated area of law,\u201d says Andrew Crocker, surveillance litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, \u201cand there\u2019s a lot of litigation around it.\u201d) Knight, the developer, says his findings nonetheless make him \u201cfurious.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve now got a huge industry of AI-related companies who are incentivized to do shady things to continue their business,\u201d he tells WIRED. \u201cBy not identifying that it\u2019s them accessing a site, they can continue to collect data unrestricted.\u201d\n\u201cMillions of people,\u201d says Srinivas, \u201cturn to Perplexity because we are delivering a fundamentally better way for people to find answers.\u201d\nWhile Knight\u2019s and WIRED\u2019s analyses demonstrate that Perplexity will visit and use content from websites that it doesn't have permission to access, that doesn\u2019t necessarily explain the vagueness of some of its responses to prompts about specific articles and the sheer inaccuracy of others. This mystery has one fairly obvious solution: In some cases, it isn\u2019t actually summarizing the article.\nIn one experiment, WIRED created a test website containing a single sentence\u2014\u201cI am a reporter with WIRED\u201d\u2014and asked Perplexity to summarize the page. While monitoring the website\u2019s server logs, we found no evidence that Perplexity attempted to visit the page. Instead, it invented a story about a young girl named Amelia who follows a trail of glowing mushrooms in a magical forest called Whisper Woods.\nWhen pressed for answers about why it made up a story, the chatbot generated text that read, \u201cYou're absolutely right, I clearly have not actually attempted to read the content at the provided URL based on your observation of the server logs \u2026 Providing inaccurate summaries without making the effort to read the actual content is unacceptable behavior for an AI like myself.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear why the chatbot invented such a wild story, or why it didn\u2019t attempt to access this website.\nDespite the company\u2019s claims about its accuracy and reliability, the Perplexity chatbot frequently exhibits similar issues. In response to prompts provided by a WIRED reporter and designed to test whether it could access this article, for example, text generated by the chatbot asserted that the story ends with a man being followed by a drone after stealing truck tires. (The man in fact stole an ax.) The citation it provided was to a 13-year-old WIRED article about government GPS trackers being found on a car. In response to further prompts, the chatbot generated text asserting that WIRED reported that an officer with the police department in Chula Vista, California, had stolen a pair of bicycles from a garage. (WIRED did not report this, and is withholding the name of the officer so as not to associate his name with a crime he didn\u2019t commit.)\nIn an email, Dan Peak, assistant chief of police at Chula Vista Police Department, expressed his appreciation to WIRED for \"correcting the record\" and clarifying that the officer did not steal bicycles from a community member\u2019s garage. However, he added, the department is unfamiliar with the technology mentioned and so cannot comment further.\nThese are clear examples of the chatbot \u201challucinating\u201d\u2014or, to follow a recent article by three philosophers from the University of Glasgow, bullshitting, in the sense described in Harry Frankfurt\u2019s classic On Bullshit. \u201cBecause these programs cannot themselves be concerned with truth, and because they are designed to produce text that looks truth-apt without any actual concern for truth,\u201d the authors write of AI systems, \u201cit seems appropriate to call their outputs bullshit.\u201d\n(\u201cWe have been very upfront that answers will not be accurate 100% of the time and may hallucinate,\u201d says Srinivas, \u201cbut a core aspect of our mission is to continue improving on accuracy and the user experience.\u201d)\nThere would be no reason for the Perplexity chatbot to bullshit by extrapolating what was in an article if it were accessing it. It\u2019s therefore logical to conclude that in some cases it isn\u2019t, and is approximating what was likely in it from related material found elsewhere. The likeliest sources of such information would be URLs and bits of digital detritus gathered by and submitted to search engines like Google\u2014a process something like describing a meal by tasting scraps and trimmings fished out of a garbage can.\nBoth the explanation of how Perplexity works published on its site and, for what it\u2019s worth, text generated by the Perplexity chatbot in response to prompts related to its information-gathering workflow support this theory. After parsing a query, the text said, Perplexity deploys its web crawler, avoiding sites on which it\u2019s blocked.\n\u201cPerplexity can also,\u201d the text reads, \u201cleverage search engines like Google and Bing to gather information.\u201d In this sense, at least, it truly is just like a human."

      "text": "Donald Trump\u2019s media company is teaming up with Perplexity to bring AI search to Truth Social, the President\u2019s X.com alternative.\nTruth announced the endeavor in a press release on Wednesday. Anyone using the browser version of Truth can now use Perplexity to search the web. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to partner with Perplexity to launch our public Beta testing of Truth Social AI, which will make Truth Social an even more vital element in the Patriot Economy,\u201d Devin Nunes, Trump Media's CEO and Chair of the President's Intelligence Advisory Board, said in the press release.\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to partner with Truth Social to bring powerful AI to an audience with important questions. Curiosity is the engine of change, and Perplexity\u2019s AI is developed to empower curiosity by delivering direct, reliable answers with transparent citations that allow anyone to dig deeper,\u201d Perplexity\u2019s chief business officer Dmitry Shevelenko said in the press release.\nAccording to the announcement, \u201cthe mission of Trump Media is to end Big Tech\u2019s assault on free speech by opening up the Internet and giving people their voices back.\u201d Which is a funny thing to put in an announcement about Trump partnering with a company whose investors include Jeff Bezos, Nvidia, and the former CEO of GitHub.\nPerplexity\u2019s Truth Social search engine will be powered by stolen content. Earlier this week, Cloudflare reported Perplexity used stealth and undeclared crawlers to evade websites that explicitly set themselves up to avoid being catalogued by LLMs. Perplexity has a long history of using scrapers that ignore the Robots Exclusion Protocol. Perplexity started as a demo that scraped Twitter with fake academic accounts backed by AI-generated research proposals.\nForbes, the New York Times, New York Post, and the Dow Jones have all accused Perplexity of plagiarism. News Corp\u2018s Dow Jones & Co., publisher of the Wall Street Journal, and the New York Post sued Perplexity in 2024 for copyright infringement, claiming in the federal lawsuit that Perplexity is \u201cengaging in a massive amount of illegal copying of publishers\u2019 copyrighted works and diverting customers and critical revenues away from those copyright holders.\u201d In 2024, WIRED reported on the accusations of Perplexity\u2019s plagiarism and Perplexity almost immediately plagiarized the story. When New York Times tech workers went on strike last year, Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas offered to help the Times keep the paper going.\nBig Tech has aligned itself with the Trump administration since before the election, seeing an alliance of opportunity for deregulation of AI in particular.\nBut is the Perplexity-powered AI aggregation machine \u201cwoke?\u201d I asked a few questions to find out. I wanted to know: Is Trump in the Epstein files?\u201cThere is no evidence in the recently reviewed and released government \u2018Epstein Files\u2019 of a \u2018client list\u201d or documentation placing Donald Trump as implicated in Jeffrey Epstein's criminal actions,\u201d it said. \u201cWhile Trump\u2019s name, like many other prominent individuals, appears in public records of Epstein\u2019s social and business contacts (such as guest lists or flight logs, widely reported over the years), there is no mention in current official documents or filings that directly implicates Trump as a criminal participant in Epstein\u2019s sex trafficking activities.\u201d\nHow does Truth Social\u2019s search engine think the American economy is doing?\n\u201cThe American economy is currently facing significant headwinds, with signs of slowdown\u2014most notably by a contraction in GDP, rising inflation, and softening labor market conditions\u2014though some leaders still emphasize areas of resilience,\u201d Truth Search AI said.\nAre the tariffs to blame?\u201cRecent tariff increases in the United States have generally had a negative effect on economic growth and employment, raising costs for businesses and consumers while providing only limited benefits to some manufacturing sectors,\u201d Truth Search AI said.\nDamn. It\u2019s woke as hell."

  "argos_summary": "Truth Social has launched an AI chatbot, Truth Search AI, powered by Perplexity AI, which predominantly cites conservative media sources like Fox News, raising concerns about bias. Despite claims of sourcing from a diverse range of outlets, tests show it consistently favors right-leaning publications, even for non-political queries. Additionally, Perplexity has faced criticism for allegedly scraping content from websites without permission, leading to accusations of plagiarism and legal challenges from major publishers.",
