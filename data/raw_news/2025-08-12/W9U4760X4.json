ChatGPT can help you explore how successful models (like Uber, Airbnb, Coursera, or Canva) could be adapted elsewhere.\n\n\u201cWhat are 5 \u2018Uber for X\u2019 startup ideas that haven\u2019t been done excessively and could still work?\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cWhat types of B2B marketplaces still don\u2019t exist and could be modeled after Alibaba or Faire?\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cSuggest ways to create a subscription-based business in industries where it\u2019s not common yet.\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cWhat \u2018Airbnb-style\u2019 peer-to-peer business models could work in childcare or eldercare?\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cWhat could a \u2018Khan Academy\u2019-type company for tradespeople look like, including certifications?\u201d\n\u2022 \u201cWhat would a Canva-style design platform look like for industrial manufacturers?\u201d\n\nSometimes, simply shifting a proven model to a new sector can unlock major value\u2014and ChatGPT can help you do that quickly and creatively.\n\nConclusion on How ChatGPT Can Help with Great Startup Business Ideas\n\nStartup ideation doesn\u2019t have to be a solitary, slow, or aimless process. With the help of ChatGPT and carefully crafted prompts, you can accelerate your thinking, broaden your scope, and discover startup opportunities in places you might never have considered. Whether you're drawn to solving big societal problems or building the next breakout consumer brand, the AI-powered brainstorming process can be a valuable co-pilot.\n\nOf course, idea generation is only the first step. Every startup idea should be tested, validated, and developed thoughtfully. But when used effectively, ChatGPT can be a game-changer for serious entrepreneurs ready to build full-time ventures with lasting impact.\n\nCopyright (c) by Richard D. Harroch.

      "text": "11 Surprisingly Useful Skills for Entrepreneurs\nSuccessful entrepreneurs often possess distinctive skills that play a crucial role in their business achievements. This article explores insights from business owners on the diverse abilities that give them a competitive edge. From emotional agility to embracing ambiguity, discover how these skills can transform your entrepreneurial journey and drive business growth.\n1. Emotional Agility\n\"One surprising skill I developed as an entrepreneur was emotional agility, something I never anticipated needing when I was focused on tech stacks, client acquisition, and scaling operations. But running a business means constantly navigating uncertainty, setbacks, and the emotional highs and lows of leadership. I had to learn how to stay grounded during chaotic launches, how to step back and recalibrate after setbacks, and how to manage my team's emotional climate during intense sprints. It's not about suppressing emotion; it's about processing it quickly and making decisions without getting paralyzed or reactive.\n\"Emotional agility has helped me build a more resilient company culture and make smarter long-term decisions. It's enabled me to listen better, communicate more clearly during high-stress moments, and earn trust with both clients and team members. I recommend every founder invest in cultivating this skill, whether through mindfulness, coaching, or reflection. In tech, we talk a lot about intelligence and execution, but in the trenches of entrepreneurship, how you respond to uncertainty often defines your trajectory.\"\n\u2014Antony Marceles, Pumex Computing\n2. Photography\n\"At first, photography was just a way to disconnect from work. But as I delved deeper into it, I started noticing the details. The way light hits a surface at 4 a.m., how a slight tilt in the frame can change the whole mood of a photo. I began practicing deliberately: taking the same shot from 10 different angles, three different times a day. Changing only one thing at a time, and trying to figure out why some photos felt more 'right' than others.\n\"That practice taught me something that I thought I knew already: selling. Well, not in the traditional sense. I didn't learn to 'close deals' from photography. But what I learned was how to see the peculiar things hidden in plain sight.\n\"Photography is all about framing, deciding what to show, what to leave out, and how to guide someone's attention. It's the same with selling. You are not just listing out features. You are showing people a version of their life where the problem they are dealing with just disappears. You are painting that picture clearly, simply, and with focus.\n\"When I started applying that mindset to how we talk about ProofHub, sales improved magically. We stopped trying to impress people with all the things the product can do, and instead focused on what using it feels like. What it is to feel a little less overwhelmed. What does control and clarity look like? That shift in our pitching tone came directly from learning how to take better photos.\n\"If I could advise other founders on unexpected skills worth developing, I would say find something that teaches you to see beyond the obvious. For me it was photography, but it can be anything that will teach you how to see something that others would generally miss. And in business, especially when you're building something from scratch, that might be the most critical skill of all.\"\n\u2014Sandeep Kashyap, ProofHub\n3. Storytelling\n\"I never thought I would need to develop my skills as a storyteller. I initially believed my primary focus would be product creation and logistics. However, I quickly realized that when I told entertaining, compelling stories, I could elevate average products into memories that stay with our customers long after the products are consumed. When I tell stories about our hampers, I'm not just describing features\u2014I am communicating the warmth, happiness, and joy that are at the center of every hamper. Being able to convey this emotional experience not only has made our customers fiercely loyal; it's helped us stand apart from many competing companies.\n\"I would encourage any entrepreneur to harness their storytelling capabilities. Customers are looking for more than just products; they are seeking stories they can experience and connect to. Stories transform people into buyers and buyers into loyal fans. Storytelling infuses a brand with humanity, enriches the way you sell, and creates authentic relationships with customers that transcend any single transaction.\"\n\u2014Mary Case, The Happy Food Company\n4. Embracing Ambiguity\n\"Running a business means confronting situations where there are no obvious solutions and the path forward is anything but certain. When Google pushes out a new algorithm update or a client faces an unexpected challenge, being comfortable with ambiguity allows me to remain calm, gather the right data, and pivot quickly without falling into analysis paralysis. It's about knowing how to keep moving forward when the ground is shifting beneath your feet and having the confidence to make decisions with imperfect information.\n\"Ambiguity is the constant companion of entrepreneurship, and those who can navigate it effectively are the ones who thrive long-term. Rather than fearing the unknown, embrace it as an opportunity to innovate and lead, not follow. Your clients, your team, and your business benefit from your steady hand when others are unsure.\"\n\u2014Jason Bland, Custom Legal Marketing\n5. Prioritizing Wellness\n\"I used to believe that relentless hustle and endless hours were the only routes to success. However, I eventually recognized that neglecting my well-being was undermining my clarity and energy, which in turn affected my leadership. This realization spurred me to embrace a more balanced approach, integrating wellness into my daily routine and the culture of our company.\n\"As a serial marathon runner, I've experienced firsthand how physical endurance can lead to mental resilience. I began sharing my passion for running with my team, encouraging them not only to take time for their health, but also to join me in marathons. Watching the team transform as they embraced regular exercise and even started participating in races has been incredibly rewarding. It's created a shared bond and boosted our collective morale and productivity.\n\"Emphasizing wellness has made us a stronger, more connected group, one that trusts each other and thrives even under pressure. Prioritizing health isn't a diversion from success; it's a driving force that enhances focus, builds resilience, and ultimately propels your business forward.\"\n\u2014Anjan Pathak, Vantage Fit\n6. Mindset Management\n\"When I first transitioned from being a tutor to founding and growing my company, I never imagined that mindset management would become one of the most crucial skills in my entrepreneurial toolkit. However, when I became a business owner, I quickly learned that entrepreneurship came with its own set of emotional ups and downs. For example, figuring out the best ways to navigate slower periods and make important decisions for both my team and our students really highlighted how important it is to maintain a strong mental game.\n\"This led me to focus on mindset management, where I shifted my perspective to see challenges not as setbacks, but as prime opportunities for growth. This change helped me cope better and, I would say, it also improved my team's morale. Being able to stay calm and centered has made me a much better leader, teacher, and service provider.\n\"I cannot stress enough how essential this skill is for any founder. It's not only important for your health, but it also plays a huge part in the morale of your entire team. The pressures of managing a business are no joke, and creating a well-built mindset from the start can really set the tone for your success.\n\"You can cultivate mindset management by building daily habits that promote mental clarity, such as journaling, meditation, or taking 10 minutes each morning to set intentions, which is what I do. You can also surround yourself with a supportive network of mentors or peers that helps reframe challenges and avoid isolation. Most importantly, learning to separate your self-worth from business outcomes allows you to make decisions with less fear and more confidence.\"\n\u2014Mohit S. Jain, Genie Academy\n7. Emotional Resilience\n\"One surprising skill I've developed as an entrepreneur is the ability to sit in discomfort and stay grounded when everything feels uncertain. When I launched my first company, I thought success would come from hustle, grit, and a solid business plan. And while those things matter, what determined whether we survived was my ability to stay calm and make good decisions when the pressure was suffocating. There were moments I didn't know how we'd make payroll. I once lived in a van to save costs while building our toy company. We had product failures and the financial collapse of 2008. But learning how to regulate my response to fear, staying focused instead of reactive, changed everything.\n\"That emotional resilience has become a competitive advantage. It's helped me close deals under pressure, lead my team through crises, and eventually grow the business into a global brand. It's also laid the foundation for my coaching work, helping leaders stay centered amid chaos.\n\"Every founder should cultivate the skill of emotional regulation. It's not just personal\u2014it's strategic. If you can stay clearheaded when others panic, you'll lead better, decide faster, and inspire trust when your team needs it most.\"\n\u2014Rhett Power, Accountability Inc.\n8. Likability\n\"As an investment manager, I initially believed that delivering strong investment results and excellent communication skills were enough to succeed. However, after over a decade as an entrepreneur, I've discovered a surprising skill I never anticipated needing: likability.\n\"I'm not talking about needing to develop the charisma that Barack Obama possesses; I just think that having a certain level of warmth and kindness can make a difference in attracting more new clients and developing stronger relationships with existing ones. As for my team members, cultivating my likability has fostered a supportive work environment, boosted morale, and driven better performance.\n\"I recommend that other founders improve their likability because it not only fuels business success but also makes the entrepreneurial journey more enjoyable and less stressful. When clients and employees genuinely support you, they become your biggest advocates, paving the way for sustainable growth.\"\n\u2014Earl Yaokasin, WealthArch Investment Services\n9. Financial Knowledge\n\"Math was my least favorite subject in school. However, when I established my company, I realized that understanding numbers and figures was essential to helping me drive growth and avoid financial problems.\n\"When I first met with investors about launching my company, I quickly realized that they weren't interested in my business ideas but rather in forecasts and cash flow. To gain a better understanding of this, I found a management accountant to help me create and understand the financial forecast for my business. This allowed me to secure investment for my new company and set us up for success. While I now have a financial director who covers the financial side of my business, having that knowledge helped me run my business in its early years.\n\"It is a skill that all founders should cultivate, as a solid understanding of your organization's finances will help you drive growth and avoid running into avoidable financial problems.\"\n\u2014Matt Collingwood, VIQU IT Recruitment\n10. Be Articulate\n\"As a business owner and a creative, learning to articulate what I'm actually trying to do or fix has been the biggest shift for me. I used to feel scattered, like everything was urgent and unclear. Problems would build up, and stress would come with it. But I saw a post on LinkedIn once that said the simple act of articulating your challenge can change everything.\n\"I tried it. I sat down, wrote out exactly what I was stuck on, and suddenly things didn't feel so overwhelming. It's helped me focus, solve things quicker, and explain what I need to others without confusion. I'd recommend every founder learn to do this. It's simple but profound!\"\n\u2014Chris Andrade, Pixelbricks Design\n11. Ability to Write Clearly and Concisely\n\"I always assumed writing was something for marketers or copywriters, not something I personally needed to master. But as the business grew, I realized how often writing is at the core of communication: investor updates, sales emails, landing pages, job descriptions, internal processes, even Slack messages.\n\"Being able to write in a way that's direct, easy to understand, and focused on what matters has saved countless hours of back-and-forth, improved decision-making, and helped build trust\u2014with both customers and the team. When your message is clear, people move faster. Misunderstandings drop. Everyone knows what they're doing and why.\n\"It's also helped with customer-facing content. Early on, we couldn't afford to hire a full content team, so I took on a lot of the writing myself. Honing that skill meant we could launch landing pages and product messaging that resonated\u2014without long delays or expensive outsourcing.\n\"Writing well isn't about being poetic\u2014it's about thinking clearly. If you can explain an idea simply, you probably understand it deeply. That's a powerful asset for any founder. I'd encourage others to treat writing like a business tool, not just a soft skill.\"\n\u2014Gabrijel Zelic, MeasureMinds Group\nAbout the Author\nPost by:Brett Farmiloe\nBrett Farmiloe is the founder and CEO of Featured, a platform where business leaders can answer questions related to their expertise and get published in articles featuring their insights.\nCompany: Featured\nWebsite: www.featured.com\nConnect with me on LinkedIn."
