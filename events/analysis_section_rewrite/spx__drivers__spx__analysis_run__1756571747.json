      "feedback": "The draft is clear on the Fed‑cut probability, the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread steepening, and the tariff‑driven DXY dip, but it drifts when it discusses “mortgage rates” and “30‑year fixed‑rate mortgage” without linking back to DXY or providing a handle; remove that paragraph or re‑frame it as a side‑note. Tighten the causal chain: Fed cut → 2‑yr yield drop → spread steepening → DXY decline (Z7O1DCHS7). Explicitly state the magnitude: 25‑bp cut → 57‑bp spread steepening → ~200‑bp DXY fall (Z7O1DCHS7). Replace vague “medium‑term pullback” with a concrete horizon: “by end‑August, DXY at 95.8, holding through September unless Fed signals a pause.” Add a quantitative risk range: if Fed hikes, DXY could rise 50‑100 bp (7XH2DKEKV). Cite the PCE/NFP dates and their impact on DXY (7XH2DKEKV). Remove the paragraph on “mortgage rates” unless you can link it to DXY via the 10‑yr yield. Finally, summarize watch signals concisely: Fed minutes (Sept 16‑17), Aug 30 PCE, Aug 31 NFP, 2‑yr/10‑yr spread trend. This keeps the focus on DXY, provides a clear transmission path, and meets the handle‑mapping and catalyst‑window requirements.",
