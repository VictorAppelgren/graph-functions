      "summary": "Defense stocks have surged this year as European governments boost military budgets, driving a significant rise in demand for industrial metals. Goldman Sachs estimates that EU defense spending will grow from 1.9% to 2.7% of GDP by 2027, adding €167 billion ($196 billion) and increasing metals demand by 6% in the region. The boost is projected to lift global copper demand growth from 2% to 2.4% annually, with potential upside to copper price forecasts amid high inventories. Nickel and steel demand are also expected to rise modestly, while the defense-driven demand could influence copper futures and overall market prices.",
