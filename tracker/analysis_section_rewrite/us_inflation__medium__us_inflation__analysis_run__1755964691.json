      "feedback": "**Actionable Edit Checklist (for the draft analysis you’re refining):**  \n1. **Depth & Causal Chain** – Expand the macro‑to‑micro link: start with the 2025 UAS job‑growth data from FOM34PUWA (97 % rise, $105,912 avg salary) and trace how proprietary contracts (e.g., General Atomics, Northrop Grumman) distort local counts, then show how this feeds into regional GDP multipliers and talent pipelines that could lift the broader tech cluster. For the automotive section, weave the RAV4’s 2025 sales (239 k units, 3.6 % decline) and hybrid‑only shift into a narrative about electrification momentum, tariff risk, and supply‑chain bottlenecks (cite H8880U45S).  \n2. **Alignment with Horizon 3–6 Months** – Anchor every catalyst in a 3–6 month window: e.g., Q3 2025 UAS contract awards, Q4 2025 RAV4 hybrid launch, Q2 2025 dividend hikes for ABT/ABBV/PFE (cite WISLWAJ15). Map path‑dependency (e.g., if tariffs lift, UAS job growth stalls; if Toyota’s hybrid‑only strategy gains traction, RAV4 sales rebound).  \n3. **First‑Principles & Scenario Structure** – For fundamentals, use the dividend‑yield logic from WISLWAJ15 (1.8 % ABT, 3.2 % ABBV, 6.7 % PFE) and compare to sector averages; for medium/current, build two scenarios: (a) “UAS boom” with 10 % YoY job growth, (b) “Tariff shock” with 5 % contraction. Include explicit triggers (e.g., new FAA regulations, tariff announcements) and invalidations (e.g., supply‑chain disruptions, consumer shift to drones).  \n4. **Quantification & Numbers** – Replace vague “significant growth” with concrete figures: e.g., “UAS jobs projected to hit 1,600 by Q4 2025” (from FOM34PUWA), “RAV4 hybrid sales to account for 55 % of total units” (H8880U45S). Use ranges for valuations: e.g., “PFE’s forward P/E of 8.3 (source GUJQZY4UO) vs. industry median 12.5.”  \n5. **Citation Density & Accuracy** – Every key claim must reference an ID: e.g., UAS job growth (FOM34PUWA), RAV4 sales (H8880U45S), dividend yields (WISLWAJ15), tariff risk (GUJQZY4UO). Ensure no source is omitted that supports a critical point.  \n6. **Conflict Reconciliation** – If sources disagree (e.g., UAS job numbers vs. local data gaps), explicitly note the discrepancy, explain the likely bias (proprietary data vs. voluntary surveys), and present a weighted estimate.  \n7. **Watch‑List Signals & Confidence** – End with a concise watch‑list: (i) FAA drone‑regulation updates, (ii) U.S.–China tariff announcements, (iii) Toyota’s hybrid‑only rollout timeline, (iv) dividend payout ratios for ABT/ABBV/PFE. Assign confidence levels (high/medium/low) based on data robustness.  \n\nImplement these edits to elevate the analysis from a surface summary to a rigorous, data‑driven, horizon‑specific forecast that meets the SECTION FOCUS and all evaluation criteria.",
