  "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump on Friday announced the U.S. government has secured a 10% stake in struggling Silicon Valley pioneer Intel in a deal that was completed just a couple weeks after he was depicting the company\u2019s CEO as a conflicted leader unfit for the job.\n\n\u201cThe United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL, a Great American Company that has an even more incredible future,\u201d Trump wrote in a post.\n\nThe U.S. government is getting the stake through the conversion of $11.1 billion in previously issued funds and pledges. All told, the government is getting 433.3 million shares of non-voting stock priced at $20.47 apiece - a discount from Friday\u2019s closing price at $24.80. That spread means the U.S. government already has a gain of $1.9 billion, on paper.\n\nThe remarkable turn of events makes the U.S. government one of Intel\u2019s largest shareholders at a time that the Santa Clara, California, company is in the process of jettisoning more than 20,000 workers as part of its latest attempt to bounce back from years of missteps taken under a variety of CEOs.\n\nIntel\u2019s current CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, has only been on the job for slightly more than five months, and earlier this month, it looked like he might be on shaky ground already after some lawmakers raised national security concerns about his past investments in Chinese companies while he was a venture capitalist. Trump latched on to those concerns in an August 7 post demanding that Tan resign.\n\nBut Trump backed off after the Malaysian-born Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, leading to a deal that now has the U.S. government betting that the company is on the comeback trail after losing more than $22 billion since the end of 2023. Trump hailed Tan as \u201chighly respected\u201d CEO in his Friday post.\n\nIn a statement, Tan applauded Trump for \u201cdriving historic investments in a vital industry\u201d and resolved to reward his faith in Intel. \u201cWe are grateful for the confidence the President and the Administration have placed in Intel, and we look forward to working to advance U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership,\u201d Tan said.\n\nIntel\u2019s current stock price is just slightly above where it was when Tan was hired in March and more than 60% below its peak reached 25 years ago when its chips were still dominating the personal computer boom before being undercut by a shift to smartphones a few years later. The company\u2019s market value currently stands at about $108 billion - a fraction of the current chip kingpin, Nvidia, which is valued at $4.3 trillion.\n\nThe stake is coming primarily through U.S. government grants to Intel through the CHIPS and Science Act that was started under President Joe Biden\u2019s administration as a way to foster more domestic manufacturing of computer chips to lessen the dependence on overseas factories.\n\nBut the Trump administration, which has regularly pilloried the policies of the Biden administration, saw the CHIPs act as a needless giveaway and is now hoping to make a profit off the funding that had been pledged to Intel.\n\n\u201cWe think America should get the benefit of the bargain,\u201d U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said earlier this week. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that it\u2019s the right move to make.\u201d\n\nAbout $7.8 billion had been pledged to Intel under the incentives program, but only $2.2 billion had been funded so far. Another $3.2 billion of the government investment is coming through the funds from another program called \u201cSecure Enclave.\u201d\n\nAlthough the U.S. government can\u2019t vote with its shares and won\u2019t have a seat on Intel\u2019s board of directors, critics of the deal view it as a troubling cross-pollination between the public and private sectors that could hurt the tech industry in a variety of ways.\n\nFor instance, more tech companies may feel pressured to buy potentially inferior chips from Intel to curry favor with Trump at a time that he is already waging a trade war that threatens to affect their products in a potential scenario cited by Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics for the Cato Institute.\n\n\u201cOverall, it\u2019s a horrendous move that will have real harms for U.S. companies, U.S. tech leadership, and the U.S. economy overall,\u201d Lincicome posted Friday.\n\nThe 10% stake could also intensify the pressure already facing Tan, especially if Trump starts fixating on Intel\u2019s stock price while resorting to his penchant for celebrating his past successes in business.\n\nNancy Tengler, CEO of money manager Laffer Tengler Investments, is among the investors who abandoned Intel years ago because of all the challenges facing Intel.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see the benefit to the American taxpayer, nor do I see the benefit, necessarily to the chip industry,\u201d Tengler said while also raising worries about Trump meddling in Intel\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care how good of businessman you are, give it to the private sector and let people like me be the critic and let the government get to the business of government,\u201d Tengler said.\n\nAlthough rare, it\u2019s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.\n\nThe U.S. government\u2019s stake in Intel coincides with Trump\u2019s push to bring production to the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country\u2019s dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.\n\nEven before gaining the 10% stake in Intel, Trump had been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are powering the AI craze, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",

The move follows Trump\u2019s earlier criticism of Intel\u2019s new CEO Lip\u2011Bu Tan over national\u2011security concerns, but Tan has since pledged allegiance to the U.S. and met with the president. Critics warn that the stake could blur public\u2011private lines, pressure other tech firms to buy Intel chips, and harm U.S. tech leadership, while supporters argue it protects domestic chip manufacturing and reduces reliance on overseas production. The deal mirrors past government interventions, such as the 2008 GM bailout, and aligns with Trump\u2019s broader push to bring chip production home amid trade tensions with China.",
