  "content": "Indexes in Europe were mostly higher Thursday, except for France's CAC 40 which fell ahead of a crucial confidence vote on Monday.\n\nThere was a sense of calm in European and U.S. bond markets after turbulence earlier this week when long-dated bond yields rose to multi-year highs.\n\n\"There are signs that the bond market rout could be over,\" XTB said.\n\nGlobal government bond sales have been strong this week and, although risks remained due to fiscal and economic concerns.\n\nThrusday brings the U.S. ADP private payrolls report at 1215 GMT and weekly jobless claims at 1230 GMT and a test for Trump's campaign to bring the Federal Reserve under tighter White House control.\n\nThe Senate will weigh confirming economic adviser Stephen Miran to the central bank's board of governors.\n\nThe key data of the week continues to be Friday's nonfarm payrolls report.\n\nFutures were mixed and moves were muted early, after markets rose yesterday after data showed the number of job openings fell in July to the lowest level in ten months.\n\n\"Not good news in itself for the economy, but since it currently increases the likelihood that the Fed will cut interest rates at its meeting on September 17, it is still interpreted as stock market positive,\" SEB said.\n\nThe dollar edged higher as investors turned their focus to labor market data for clues on the pace of expected Fed rate cuts.\n\nING said, while the prospect of weak employment data and the Fed resuming rate cuts at the September 17 meeting would usually be negative for the dollar, the currency could find some support from seasonal factors.\n\n\"Yesterday's soft U.S. labour market data drove bond yields lower as the market looks for the Federal Reserve to cut rates in September,\" Danske Bank said.\n\nThe 30-year yield was again relatively comfortably below 5%.\n\nEurozone government bond yields edged lower, even as significant issuance volumes from Spain and France loomed.\n\n\"On the supply side, eurozone government bond markets will have to absorb a decent chunk of duration today, led by long-end [French] OAT auctions,\" Commerzbank said, adding that Bunds might recover further once this week's duration supply has been cleared, and with potential support from U.S. data.\n\nDanske Bank said France's auction of long-dated government bonds was the last ahead of the government's upcoming confidence vote.\n\nThe Japanese finance ministry's auction of 30-year JGBs drew lackluster demand, which was widely expected amid fiscal concerns.\n\nOil prices fell, extending the previous session's losses on concerns that OPEC+ members might consider releasing more barrels in October.\n\nBenchmarks dropped Wednesday following a Reuters report that the alliance would consider boosting output further at a policy meeting this week, contrary to widespread market expectations.\n\n\"While insiders emphasized no final decision yet to be made, the signal was enough to deflate prices in a market prone to overreaction,\" Pepperstone said.\n\nMeanwhile, investors await the latest U.S. stockpile report by the EIA due Thursday for insights into demand trends in the world's largest crude consumer.\n\nGold futures fell, pulling back from record highs on profit taking but the precious metal remained up nearly 4% on week on expectations of a September U.S. interest-rate cut, tariffs raising costs and rising pessimism around market growth, Pepperstone said.\n\nGold has become a barometer of decreasing confidence in the economic and financial outlook, it added, saying inflows into gold assets have broadened beyond just exchange traded funds, and into major hedge funds and central banks.\n\nRecent cuts to China's crude steel output appear weighted toward scrap-based electric arc furnaces, lessening the impact on iron-ore demand, Morgan Stanley said, expecting iron ore around $100/metric ton in 4Q 2025 and 1Q 2026.\n\nCiti was bearish on lithium prices for the next six months and said recent supply cuts were likely temporary, and a sustained market surplus should pull prices lower once more.\n\nIt had a 6-12 month target on spodumene SC6 of $800/ton, and over the same period expected lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide around $9,000/ton and $8,750/ton, respectively.\n\nSwiss Inflation Holds Steady as SNB Mulls Rate Cut Below Zero\n\nSwiss annual inflation held at a low level in August, keeping the country's central bank on guard as it considers cutting its key interest rate to below zero later this month.\n\nConsumer prices were 0.2% higher than the same month of last year, matching July's rate, Switzerland's statistics office said Thursday. That remains within the Swiss National Bank's target of positive inflation lower than 2%.\n\nShares in Currys jumped after the company reported what it called a strong start to its fiscal year with revenue growth and launched a share buyback.\n\nThe stock was up 19% at 129.90 pence in European morning trading. Over the year to date, shares have climbed more than 36%.\n\nSanofi said its amlitelimab experimental drug met all main goals in a late-stage clinical trial with eczema patients.\n\nThe French pharmaceutical company said Thursday that amlitelimab showed efficacy in skin clearance and disease severity compared to placebo in a phase 3 study with adolescent and adults with eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis. The drug's efficacy increased progressively throughout the treatment period, the company added.\n\nA weak August jobs report will tee up the Fed to reduce interest rates. A worse one may spur even more cuts.\n\nIs the August jobs report the biggest in years? Probably not, but another tepid increase in hiring is sure to cement a reduction in U.S. interest rates this month - and possibly more cuts after that.\n\nWall Street is certainly expecting a dull jobs report. Forecasters predict a small 75,000 increase in new jobs, with the unemployment rate rising a notch to a nearly four-year high of 4.3%.\n\nHiring and layoffs were broadly steady in July, according to data published Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a mostly reassuring sign about the labor market amid fears that the outlook for people with jobs could deteriorate.\n\nThe start of the summer saw no big uptick of firings, the data suggest, with the rate of layoffs in the economy holding steady at 1.1% from June-also the same level as 12 months ago. About 1.8 million people were laid off in July, showing just a slight uptick from the June level.\n\nFed Gov. Waller Eyes Multiple Rate Cuts. Other Officials Are Less Certain.\n\nFederal Reserve governor Christopher Waller is pushing for lower interest rates at the central bank's policy meeting this month, but other officials are still taking a more cautious approach.\n\nWaller not only wants to see the Fed cut rates at the coming Sept. 16-17 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, but said Wednesday that multiple rate cuts should be on the table over the next three to six months.\n\nShrouded in Mystery, Kim's Young Daughter Softens His Image in China\n\nSEOUL-When Kim Jong Un stepped off his bulletproof train in Beijing for this week's extravagant commemoration of China's victory in World War II, a smiling young woman dressed in a demure navy pantsuit stood close behind the North Korean leader as he greeted China's foreign minister.\n\nThe woman wasn't North Korea's first lady-it was Kim's young daughter.\n\nThe federal government improperly cut off $2.2 billion in research funding from Harvard University and must restore the funds, a federal judge ruled Wednesday, concluding the Trump administration's actions violated Harvard's constitutional rights.\n\nThe ruling by U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs of Massachusetts comes as Harvard and the Trump administration have been in talks to resolve months of the government's pressure tactics over what it calls antisemitism and diversity-related concerns. President Trump said last month that he wants no less than $500 million from Harvard, telling Education Secretary Linda McMahon during a cabinet meeting: \"They've been very bad. Don't negotiate.\"\n\nMEXICO CITY-Secretary of State Marco Rubio pledged to foster security cooperation and respect Mexico's sovereignty and territory a day after the U.S. military sank an alleged drug-carrying boat in the Caribbean, a major escalation that rattled regional partners and adversaries alike.\n\nRubio kicked off his visit to Mexico and Ecuador, two allies in the Trump administration's war on drugs, meeting with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum at the ornate National Palace in Mexico City on Wednesday morning. Bilateral security issues and the war against powerful drug cartels headed the agenda.\n\nWrite to us at newsletters@dowjones.com\n\nWe offer an enhanced version of this briefing that is optimized for viewing on mobile devices and sent directly to your email inbox.

  "summary": "European and U.S. bond markets were mostly higher on Thursday, except for France's CAC 40 which fell ahead of a crucial confidence vote on Monday. Despite ongoing concerns over global bond sales, there is a sense of calm in the bond market after a period of turbulence when long-dated bond yields rose to multi-year highs. The key data of the week is the nonfarm payrolls report, which will be released on Friday. The dollar edged higher as investors focused on labor market data for clues on the pace of expected Fed rate cuts. Meanwhile, the Senate is considering confirming economic adviser Stephen Miran to the Federal Reserve's board of governors. The Swiss National Bank of Switzerland remains within its key interest rate, maintaining its current level of 0.2% and maintaining a steady inflation rate of below zero. Goldman Sachs reported that the country's National Interest Rate was held at a low level in August and that the Swiss National Bureau of Statistics remained within its guard as it considers cutting its inflation rate below zero later this year. The latest US stockpile report by the EIA is expected to reveal demand trends.",

The market is closely watching Thursday\u2019s ADP private payrolls and weekly jobless claims, which could reinforce expectations of September rate cuts and support the dollar\u2019s seasonal strength.  Commodity prices fell on OPEC+ output concerns, but gold remained near\u2011record highs on expectations of a September U.S. rate cut and rising tariff\u2011related costs.",
