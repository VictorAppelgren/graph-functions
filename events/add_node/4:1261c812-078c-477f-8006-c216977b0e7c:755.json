      "rationale": "The rise in German retail investors represents a medium‑horizon, sector‑specific driver of equity demand. It signals a structural shift in market participation that can influence the DAX and broader equity markets over days to months, but it does not have the immediate, high‑centrality impact of core macro variables or intraday traded assets. Hence it is best classified as a level‑3 medium‑importance macro indicator."
