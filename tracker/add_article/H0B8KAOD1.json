      "summary": "A 7‑4 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit declared most of President Trump’s ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs unconstitutional, affirming a lower court’s decision that the president lacked authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The judgment does not take effect until October 14, so tariffs remain in place for the interim and the administration is expected to appeal to the Supreme Court. The ruling is expected to ease pressure on small U.S. importers—such as the toy‑kit maker MicroKits—by potentially halting the high duties that have raised costs and constrained production. Market reaction remains uncertain, but the decision could dampen the broader trade‑policy uncertainty that has weighed on equities, credit spreads, and commodity prices.",
