  "title": "Americans More Worried About Rising Prices In New Survey",
  "description": "More Americans expressed concerns that tariffs would impact prices.",
  "content": "Consumer sentiment\u2014a measurement of Americans\u2019 views on the economic outlook\u2014dropped to 58.2 in August from 61.7 in July, well below the historical benchmark of 100, a reading of the University of Michigan\u2019s survey found, after economists expected the reading to hold at a preliminary reading of 58.6. Americans expect inflation to rise to 4.8% over the next year, above July\u2019s projections of 4.5%, and for prices to increase 3.5% over the next five to 10 years, an uptick from 3.9% in the survey\u2019s preliminary reading, but still above last month\u2019s 3.4%. The survey also found roughly 63% of consumers believe unemployment will worsen over the next year. Joanne Hsu, the survey\u2019s director, said in a statement that buying conditions for durable goods\u2014long-lasting products like appliances\u2014dropped to their lowest in a year as personal finances declined 7%, as Hsu cited \u201cheightened concerns about high prices.\u201d\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics will release unemployment data next week\u2014the first since President Donald Trump fired its director\u2014as Wall Street expects a slight uptick from 4.2% in July to 4.3% in August, according to FactSet. About 92,500 nonfarm jobs are projected to have been added last month, above the 73,000 recorded last month. The BLS will likely face scrutiny after Trump fired commissioner Erika McEntarfer, whom he accused of manipulating jobs data during the 2024 election to benefit Kamala Harris. Trump nominated Heritage Foundation economist E.J. Antoni as the next commissioner. Antoni, a public critic of McEntarfer, has been criticized by former Democrat officials as being \u201ccompletely unqualified\u201d for the role and alleged Antoni may abuse his role as an \u201cextreme partisan.\u201d\n\nDeclining optimism among American consumers comes as inflation remained above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% goal in July. Core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index data released earlier Friday found annual inflation hit 2.9% in July, matching economist\u2019s projections and a 0.1% increase from June. Consumer spending increased 0.3% over the month to a four-month high, however, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics rose 0.4%. The PCE data\u2014the central bank\u2019s preferred reading for inflation\u2014and upcoming jobs report will be the last before the Fed considers a possible interest rate cut in September. Fed Governor Christopher Waller, who voted in favor of a quarter-point reduction in July, said Thursday he would again support rates falling from a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where they have sat since December. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has faced pressure from President Donald Trump to lower rates, has argued in favor of a cautious monetary policy, citing potential impacts of Trump\u2019s tariffs on the economy in the near future.",

Sentiment now stands about 11% above readings from April and May but remains at least 10% below 6 and 12 months ago. This month\u2019s decrease was visible across groups by age, income, and stock wealth. Moreover, perceptions of many aspects of the economy slipped. Buying conditions for durable goods subsided to their lowest reading in a year, and current personal finances declined 7%, both due to heightened concerns about high prices. Expectations for business conditions and labor markets contracted in August as well. That said, expectations for personal finances held steady this month, albeit at relatively subdued levels relative to a year ago. This month, few consumers spontaneously mentioned the recent events at the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Federal Reserve (interviews closed on Monday, August 25, the day Trump announced he was firing Governor Cook).\nYear-ahead inflation expectations moved up from 4.5% last month to 4.8% this month. This rise was seen across multiple demographic groups. Independents and Republicans both exhibited month-over-month increases; expectations for Democrats were unchanged from July. Long-run inflation expectations edged up from 3.4% in July to 3.5% in August. This month ended two consecutive months of receding inflation for short-run expectations and three straight months for long-run expectations. Still, both readings remain well below the highs seen briefly in April and May 2025.\nYear-ahead inflation expectations moved up from 4.5% last month to 4.8% this month.

      "text": "Topline\nAn inflation measurement favored by the Federal Reserve matched Wall Street\u2019s expectations as consumer spending hit a four-month high, according to federal data released Friday.\nKey Facts\nAnnual inflation was 2.9% in July and a 0.1% uptick from June, according to core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index data released Friday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, matching consensus analyst forecasts, according to FactSet.\nThe reading remained above the Fed\u2019s 2% target for core PCE inflation, the central bank\u2019s preferred gauge of price changes that excludes food and energy markets, for the 53rd consecutive month.\nConsumer spending, adjusting for inflation, increased 0.3% month-over-month to a four-month high as personal income jumped 0.4%.\nHeadline PCE inflation was 2.6%, matching June\u2019s price increases and matching projections.\nWhat To Watch For\nFriday\u2019s PCE report is the last before the Fed\u2019s policy committee meeting in September. Investors are anticipating interest rates, which have been held between 4.25% and 4.5% since December, to be lowered during the September session after Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled the agency would likely ease its monetary policy earlier this month. The Fed operates on a policy of setting rates to keep inflation and unemployment low, yet Powell warned earlier this year the impact of tariffs on the economy has yet to be seen and could raise prices. Powell noted the \u201cbalance of risks [appears] to be shifting\u201d between unemployment and inflation, citing \u201csweeping changes\u201d in trade, immigration and tax policy under the Trump administration.\nBig Number\n85.3%. Those are the odds the Fed eases interest rates by at least a quarter-point in September, according to CME\u2019s FedWatch. Investors traded at odds as high as 99.9% earlier this month after earlier inflation data indicated prices increased more slowly than expected.\nKey Background\nThe central bank favors core PCE data more than inflation readings released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics because it allows the Fed to better understand how Americans spend their money and how their spending habits change. President Donald Trump has pressured the Fed to cut interest rates and called on Powell to resign, claiming Powell has been \u201ctoo late\u201d to opt for a looser monetary policy. Fed governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller have argued for a quarter-point reduction and dissented with a decision to hold rates at the Fed\u2019s last meeting in June. Some economists have warned Trump\u2019s tariffs on U.S. trade partners will raise prices for Americans this year: UBS analysts forecast CPI inflation hitting 3.9% by December, while Bank of America projected core PCE inflation rising to 3.1%. Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets, wrote in a note earlier this week that \u201cif it weren\u2019t for all the politics,\u201d inflation remaining above the Fed\u2019s 2% goal is \u201cnot exactly crying out for a rate cut in September.\u201d"

The BLS will release August jobs data next week, with markets anticipating a modest rise in unemployment and 92,500 new non\u2011farm jobs.
