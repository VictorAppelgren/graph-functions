  "title": "Hong Kong stocks gain the most in 2 weeks after Fed\u2019s Powell hints at rate cut",
  "description": "China Evergrande, once the mainland\u2019s top developer by sales, delisted after 16 years.",
  "content": "The Hang Seng Index added 1.2 per cent to 25,642.70 at 9.50am local time, the biggest gain in two weeks. The Hang Seng Tech Index rose 1.8 per cent. On the mainland, the CSI 300 Index gained 0.8 per cent and the Shanghai Composite Index strengthened 0.6 per cent.\n\nMining firm Zijin Mining surged 5.1 per cent to HK$24.04 and chipmaker SMIC jumped 3 per cent to HK$58.55. Search-engine leader Baidu added 3.7 per cent to HK$88.85, online games provider NetEase climbed 3.3 per cent to HK$212 and e-commerce giant JD.com advanced 2.8 per cent to HK$124.80.\n\nSinopharm Group fell 1.3 per cent to HK$19.27, while Wuxi Biologics dropped 1 per cent to HK$32.60.\n\nAfter Powell hinted at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday that interest rates could head lower amid a softening jobs market, the S&P 500 rose 1.5 per cent higher, its best gain since May 27, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite added 1.9 per cent.\n\nChina Group was delisted from the Hong Kong stock exchange on Monday, marking the end of a 16-year run for what was once the country\u2019s largest developer by sales. The move underscores the deep crisis engulfing China\u2019s property sector after the company defaulted on its debt in 2021. The company\u2019s liabilities had snowballed to more than US$300 billion at its peak.",
