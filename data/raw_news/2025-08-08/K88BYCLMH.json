  "title": "Review: Gone too soon, an unsettled life finds focus in 'It\u2019s Never Over, Jeff Buckley'",
  "description": "The singer-songwriter had enormous promise and plenty of complexity, as explored by friends and family in director Amy Berg's profile, refreshingly raw and honest.",
  "content": "Short, pained lives marked by achievement and promise and then abruptly gone leave a restless afterglow. Youth is supposed to fade away, not become one\u2019s permanent state. And regarding the late musician Jeff Buckley \u2014 a roiling romantic with piercing good looks whose singing could rattle bones and raise hairs \u2014 that loss in 1997, at the age of 30 from drowning, burns anew with every revisiting of his sparse legacy of recorded material.\n\nLives are more complicated than what your busted heart may want to read from a voice that conjured heaven and the abyss. So one of the appealing takeaways from the biodoc \u201cIt\u2019s Never Over, Jeff Buckley\u201d is a repudiating of the typical narrative of inescapable fate, instead pursuing the richness of a gifted artist\u2019s ups and downs. Director Amy Berg would rather us see Buckley as he was in the world instead of some conveniently doom-laden figure.\n\nThe result is loving, spirited and honest: an opportunity for us to get to know the talented, turbulent Buckley through the people who genuinely knew him and cared about him. But also, in clips, copious writings and snatches of voice recordings, we meet someone empathetic yet evasive, ambitious yet self-critical, a son and his own man, especially when sudden stardom proved to be the wrong prism through which to find answers.\n\nWith archival material often superimposed over a faint, scratchy-film background, we feel the sensitivity and chaos of Buckley\u2019s single-mom upbringing in Anaheim, the devastating distance of his absentee dad, folk-poet icon Tim Buckley (you\u2019ll never forget the matchbook Jeff saved), and the creative blossoming that happened in New York\u2019s East Village. There, his long-standing influences, from Nina Simone and Edith Piaf to Led Zeppelin and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, coalesced into a post-grunge emotionalism anchored by those unbelievable pipes.\n\nEven after Buckley\u2019s record-label discovery leads to the usual music-doc trappings \u2014 tour montages, media coverage, performance morsels \u2014 Berg wisely keeps the contours of his interior life in the foreground, intimately related by key figures, most prominently Buckley\u2019s mother, Mary Guibert, romantic confidantes such as artist Rebecca Moore and musician Joan Wasser, and bandmates like Michael Tighe. Berg keeps these interviewees close to her camera, too, so we can appreciate their memories as personal gifts, still raw after so many years.\n\nFans might yearn for more granular unpacking of the music, but it somehow doesn\u2019t feel like an oversight when so much ink on it already exists and so little else has been colored in. The same goes for the blessed absence of boilerplate A-list praise. The global acclaim for his sole album, 1994\u2019s \u201cGrace,\u201d which includes his all-timer rendition of Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cHallelujah,\u201d certainly put admiring superstars (Dylan, Bowie, McCartney) in Buckley\u2019s path, including one of his idols, Robert Plant. But Berg stays true to a viewpoint rooted in Buckley\u2019s conflicting feelings about the pressures and absurdities of fame, and why it ultimately drove him to Memphis to seek the solace to start a second album that was never completed.\n\nThe last chapter is thoughtfully handled. Berg makes sure that we understand that his loved ones view his death as an accident, not a suicide, and the movie\u2019s details are convincing. That doesn\u2019t make the circumstances any less heartbreaking, of course. As warmer spotlights go, \u201cIt\u2019s Never Over, Jeff Buckley\u201d may never fully expunge what maddens and mystifies about the untimely end of troubled souls. But it candidly dimensionalizes a one-album wonder, virtually ensuring the kind of relistening likely to deepen those echoes.",

      "text": "POP MUSIC : Wading Beyond the Gene Pool : His late father was a famous folkie, but singer-songwriter Jeff Buckley is charting his own course.\n- Share via\nNEW YORK \u2014 You\u2019d never know by talking to Jeff Buckley that he is one of the most acclaimed pop arrivals of the \u201890s, a singer-songwriter whose emotionally charged tales of romantic innocence and obsession remind you of a radical mix of Leonard Cohen and Edith Piaf.\nFrom his tone during an interview near closing time in an Italian restaurant here, you\u2019d think Buckley\u2019s 1994 debut album, \u201cGrace,\u201d had been savaged by critics.\n\u201cCritics . . . ,\u201d he says pointedly. \u201cThey\u2019re like traffic cops. They say what they have to say, then leave, and another guy moves in and he has his say--and it\u2019s often just the opposite. The result is either critical acclaim or critical murder, and neither has any bearing on my music or direction.\u201d\nBlessed with some of the most photogenic cheekbones since Sting, Buckley, 28, leans back and lights a cigarette, pushing strands of his long hair from his face.\nHe\u2019s quiet for a few seconds, as if awaiting the next question. Instead, he\u2019s just warming up for Round 2 on critics.\n\u201cThe thing about a music career is that it ain\u2019t over until the fat lady sings. Look at all the times people threw in the towel on Dylan--or Neil Young. Remember when Young was doing things in the \u201880s like \u2018Trans\u2019 and the rockabilly album and being completely lambasted by critics who now think he is wonderful again? They\u2019re having to eat crow, and the funny thing is they don\u2019t even recognize it.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the kind of philosophical tirade you would expect from a veteran artist, like a Dylan or a Joni Mitchell, who has lived through decades of both critical praise and indifference.\nBut that\u2019s not Buckley\u2019s story. He\u2019s still in the first blush of critical embrace. Even if parts of \u201cGrace\u201d are hazy and histrionic, the album carries the stamp of an artist with a sweeping, slightly mystical personal vision.\nPraise has been especially glowing in England, where the respected pop monthly Mojo named \u201cGrace\u201d the album of the year and Q magazine hailed it as \u201can enthralling, endlessly playable piece of work . . . the missing link between (Van Morrison\u2019s) \u2018Astral Weeks\u2019 and (Nirvana\u2019s) \u2018Nevermind.\u2019 \u201d\nIsn\u2019t Buckley flattered?\n\u201cOf course I am,\u201d he says, shifting in his chair as if annoyed at himself for admitting it. \u201cAt the same time, I\u2019m not \u2018Grace.\u2019 That album is like a brick onto itself. It\u2019s like a coffin that I put certain feelings and observations in so that they can be capsulized forever. I wanted to put them there so I would be free to move on.\n\u201cThere are times when what you do will be mysterious to everyone . . . times when you have to change directions before people are ready. Just because someone does something that critics don\u2019t like or understand doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re failing as a musician. It probably means you\u2019re growing.\u201d\nOne of the truisms of pop music is that if an artist\u2019s music has strong personal characteristics, you will probably find the same traits in the artist. In interviews, Michael Stipe of R.E.M. can be as interesting yet as elusive as Stipe the songwriter. Offstage, Bono of U2 is as passionate and involving as Bono the singer.\nAnd Buckley--the son of \u201860s folk cult hero Tim Buckley--can be as strong-willed and focused as Buckley the performer.\nOnstage, he drifts into his own world, singing with a self-absorption that tells the audience he is a distinct and demanding performer. In the restaurant, Buckley speaks with equal intensity--whether on the folly of critics or the search for his own creative vision.\n\u201cThe first time I saw him onstage, I was amazed at how raw and unconventional he was,\u201d says Dave Lory, who co-manages Buckley with attorney George Stein. \u201cEven in rehearsal, the way he approached a song was totally different from the norm. You could see he wasn\u2019t trying to copy anyone else.\u201d\nAbout his musical journey, Buckley says: \u201cThe whole secret in searching for your own voice is to have faith in your deepest eccentricities, your dumbest banalities, your epic romanticism. . . . Accept what\u2019s inherently inside of you without fear. If you don\u2019t find that voice as an artist, you are leading a life that is a secondhand life, which is basically a mild form of torture and decay.\u201d\nThough it\u2019s the last thing Buckley probably wants to hear, his voice and his intense, eclectic direction are likely to remind some listeners of his father, who was a prized member in the \u201860s of the Elektra Records roster that also included such experimental rock forces as the Doors.\nIn the latest edition of \u201cThe Rolling Stone Record Guide,\u201d the elder Buckley is described in ways that could apply today to young Jeff: \u201cDreamily handsome, possessed of a genuine, if eccentric poetic gift, capable of singing a veritable choir of voices and brandishing an archetypally romantic sensibility.\u201d\nDuring the interview, Buckley tenses at the mention of his father, who died of a drug overdose in 1975 at age 28.\n\u201cEverything I know about him was secondhand, except for maybe a week, and even then I don\u2019t remember much,\u201d Buckley says sharply. \u201cGenetics be damned. . . .I have completely different musical choices.\u201d\nJeff Buckley was born Nov. 17, 1966, in Anaheim and lived most of the time through high school in Orange and Riverside counties. His parents were married only briefly and he was raised by his mother, who supported him and a brother from a short-lived second marriage in the early \u201870s.\nBuckley developed an early interest in music, listening to a wide variety of albums, from the \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d soundtrack to the Beatles and Joni Mitchell. During his teens he was in several bands, playing Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath music, before starting to write his own songs.\nAfter high school he moved to Los Angeles, where he attended a musicians institute and worked at the front desk of the Magic Hotel, which is affiliated with the Magic Castle in Hollywood.\nDespite his love of music, Buckley didn\u2019t spend much time pursuing a record contract at that time, because he was disillusioned by things he saw happening to friends.\n\u201cThey kept getting signed and dropped or signed and left on the shelf,\u201d he says, lighting another cigarette. \u201cThe music business in L.A. was like a crapshoot. It was like going to Vegas and the money always belongs to the house. I just didn\u2019t care. I just wanted to learn and compose things.\u201d\nRestless, he moved to New York around 1990 and fell in love with the city. Buckley remained largely under wraps until a 1991 tribute to his father at St. Ann\u2019s, a Brooklyn church with a history of contemporary music events.\n\u201cI declined (to participate) at first because his life had nothing to do with mine,\u201d he says. \u201cIf he wasn\u2019t involved then, I didn\u2019t know why I should be involved now. . . . To me, Ron Moorhead was my father.\u201d\nMoorhead was Buckley\u2019s stepfather, and as a child Buckley was known as Scott Moorhead. (His family still calls him Scottie.) He reverted to his original name when his mother and stepfather broke up.\n\u201cI had no idea at the time that any of this would happen,\u201d Buckley says of his music career. \u201cI just wanted my own identity, so I asked my mother what was the name on my birth certificate.\u201d\nDespite his initial reservations, Buckley eventually agreed to perform at the tribute, which was organized by record producer Hal Willner. Buckley hadn\u2019t attended his father\u2019s funeral, and he saw this concert as a way to say goodby.\nAfter teaming briefly in a band composed of some musicians from the progressive scene surrounding St. Ann\u2019s and New York\u2019s celebrated Knitting Factory, Buckley decided in early 1992 to focus on a solo career. Intent on developing his own style in Greenwich Village clubs, he experimented with musical forms, from folk and jazz to a trace of cabaret. He supplemented his own songs with music identified with such varied artists as Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Nina Simone and Piaf.\nThe last had been a favorite for years.\n\u201cI saw her on a PBS special when I was around 16 and fell in love with her,\u201d Buckley says. \u201cI said, \u2018That\u2019s for me\u2019--the way she seemed to be giving you everything onstage. There was something about her that I resonated with. She put what I was feeling into a certain clarity.\u201d\nWithin months, record company scouts were packing tiny Cafe Sin-e, a Village venue that Buckley adopted as his home base. He signed with Columbia Records and began work early in 1993 on \u201cGrace,\u201d whose sales are now about 125,000 in the United States and 300,000 worldwide. The material ranges from a version of Cohen\u2019s \u201cHallelujah\u201d to seven songs Buckley wrote or co-wrote. The themes are chiefly about romance, often in fragile and sad terms.\nMore than most songwriters, Buckley places special importance on his vocals. Almost as if impatient with mere words, he searches for added vocal color to convey the intensity of the song\u2019s emotions.\n\u201cI don\u2019t separate the song and the voice and the music,\u201d he says. \u201cA good record is a marriage. People always talk about Dylan as a great songwriter, but he\u2019s also an amazing singer. Take something like \u2018Knockin\u2019 on Heaven\u2019s Door.\u2019 It\u2019s only two minutes long, but I can play it all day long because it strikes something inside me. . . . It\u2019s something that feels so true. That\u2019s the goal, for me. You want to create a special place with your music and then transport the listener to that place.\u201d\nAfter a series of European shows, Buckley expects to return in late March to the States, where he is likely to tour through the summer. He will then begin focusing on the second album, which may not be released until more than a year from now.\nWhere many record companies would be pushing an artist to strike back with a second album as fast as possible to take advantage of the mushrooming interest, Columbia supports Buckley\u2019s slower pace.\n\u201cI was floored by what I saw at those early shows,\u201d says Don Ienner, president of Columbia Records, recalling the Cafe Sin-e appearances. \u201cYou could only sit back and imagine where he was headed, and the growth was in leaps and bounds once he got into the studio. Now, you can only imagine where the next album will take him.\u201d\nAbout the nature of that eventual next album and the reaction to it, Buckley says, in the teasingly mysterious aura of his music: \u201cWho knows who is going to want to stay with \u2018Grace\u2019 and who is going to want to stay with me? . . . All I can tell you is that your expectations will totally deceive you.\u201d"

      "text": "POP MUSIC REVIEWS : Jeff Buckley\u2019s Gambles Pay Off\n- Share via\nJeff Buckley sings like a man with more than a few exposed nerves. He sings mostly in an expressive falsetto given to wild shifts in volume and hysteria, delivering messages of isolation, romance and other urban ailments to uncomfortable extremes.\nThat voice, and the jazz-flavored, charged rock he plays behind it, makes Buckley a self-indulgent new pop artist with the best of intentions: a willingness to take unexpected chances with his music and audience.\nFor the record:\n12:00 a.m. Aug. 1, 1994 For the Record\nLos Angeles Times Monday August 1, 1994 Home Edition Calendar Part F Page 10 Column 1 Entertainment Desk 2 inches; 38 words Type of Material: Correction\nWrong songwriter--Due to an editing error, a Saturday Calendar review of singer Jeff Buckley\u2019s concert misidentified a song he performed as having been written by his father. The song, \u201cKangaroo,\u201d was written by Alex Chilton and originally performed by the band Big Star.\nAt the Las Palmas Theatre in Hollywood on Thursday, Buckley and a three-piece band explored subtlety through passages that had the light touch of a cool jazz combo, only to shatter the quiet with sudden bursts from Buckley\u2019s electric guitar. It was difficult pop played well, reflecting deep influences from the likes of Leonard Cohen and other rock sophisticates, including Buckley\u2019s father, the late cult-hero singer-songwriter Tim Buckley, whose \u201cKangaroo\u201d was the encore.\nThe night was also a preview of young Buckley\u2019s debut album, \u201cGrace,\u201d to be released next month on Columbia Records, with many of Buckley\u2019s same fragile arrangements, the moments of feedback from his plugged-in acoustic, the occasional jarring crescendo.\nBuckley wore faded Bohemian threads Thursday that perhaps better reflected his life now on New York\u2019s Lower East Side, rather than his earlier years playing in Hollywood. Between songs, he was achingly soft-spoken on such matters, as if the vocal excesses of his performance left him too taxed for anything else."

      "text": "- Share via\nOver the last decade, the streaming revolution has triggered a documentary gold rush. Whatever your nonfiction area of interest happens to be \u2014 serial killers, cult leaders, athletes, con men or exotic animal enthusiasts \u2014 there\u2019s probably several dozen documentaries available for viewing a few button-clicks away.\nThankfully, this is also true for those of us who enjoy a well-told saga about a more universal human interest: music. There\u2019s been a renaissance recently in pop music documentaries on subjects ranging from Wham! to Jennifer Lopez. In the last few months alone, revealing feature-length films about Celine Dion and Elton John have landed on streaming, casting iconic figures in a vulnerable new light. Apple TV+ also announced plans for a film about Fleetwood Mac. The platforms have also made it easier for viewers to access great documentaries dating back to the early days of pop music.\nFor those who can\u2019t get enough about music and musicians \u2014 whether tragically exploited, woefully misunderstood or just prodigiously talented \u2014 we\u2019ve compiled a list of great documentaries currently available to stream, divided chronologically by subject between TV critic Robert Lloyd and reporter Meredith Blake . It is by no means comprehensive, but if you\u2019re hankering for one great music doc or 10, it\u2019s a place to start. Please note: some great titles, like \u201cTruth or Dare,\u201d \u201cAmy\u201d and \u201cSome Kind of Monster,\u201d were not included because they are currently available only for rental.\n\u2018Jazz on a Summer\u2019s Day\u2019 (1959)\nWould I call this memento of the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival the best of all concert films? I would. Certainly it\u2019s the most visually beautiful, co-directed by the American fashion photographer Bert Stern (best known for Marilyn Monroe\u2019s last photo session) with editor Aram Avakian. Creamy and atmospheric, with a keen sense of color and light, it arranges performances from four days into a single, morning-to-night concert, beginning with Thelonious Monk and ending with Mahalia Jackson. Along the way are the likes of Sonny Stitt, Gerry Mulligan, Anita O\u2019Day in her big feathered hat, Chuck Berry backed by jazz musicians (this must be the only version of \u201cSweet Little Sixteen\u201d to include a clarinet solo), Louis Armstrong and Jack Teagarden doing their \u201cRocking Chair\u201d double act, and much more. (Stream on Plex and Kanopy.) \u2014 Robert Lloyd\n\u2018What Happened, Miss Simone?\u2019 (2015)\nLiz Garbus\u2019 journey through the life and career of singer-pianist Nina Simone has an edge-of-your-seat, can\u2019t-look-away power. Simone set out to be a classical pianist, but fate opened a different door, and she applied her training to a powerful blend of jazz, blues, Bach, soul and pop that made her a star from the late 1950s. Though there are many themes here \u2014 race, self-determination, mental illness, the domestic strife that enters into many such show business stories when a person is also a commodity. But what shines through, from an illustrious beginning to what, after some hard years, feels like a happy end, is her ferocious talent; every performance, and we see many, is spine-tingling good. (Stream on Netflix.) \u2014 R.L.\n\u2018Dont Look Back\u2019 (1967)\nBob Dylan \u2014 or Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet \u2014 is having a media moment with the biopic \u201cA Complete Unknown\u201d about to be unleashed. But for a grainy, black and white glimpse of the real thing in action, go to D.A. Pennebaker\u2019s cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 record of Dylan\u2019s 1965 tour of England, as he transitions from Great Folk Hope to Arty Enfant Terrible. The Dylan seen here can be charming or arrogant \u2014 sometimes both at once \u2014 childish or wise. The solo performances as Pennebaker films them are arresting and gorgeous, but he does as well capturing the public hubbub and private interludes. This is the source, as well, of the \u201cSubterranean Homesick Blues\u201d cue-card proto-video, tacked on as a sort of curtain-raiser, with a deadpan Dylan running through cue cards as friends Bob Neuwirth and Allen Ginsberg lurk in the background. (Stream on Max and Criterion Channel for free through Jan. 1.) \u2014 R.L.\nBob Dylan, ever elusive, has starred in or inspired numerous movies. Here are five to watch before the arrival of \u2018A Complete Unknown\u2019 starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet.\n\u2018Long Strange Trip\u2019 (2017)\nDepending on how you feel about their music, and the culture that surrounds it, a six-part, four-hour docuseries on the Grateful Dead will seem not a minute too short or four hours too long. But for anyone not, um, dead set against them, Amir Bar-Lev\u2018s sweet, bittersweet, funny, tragic and inspiring film, affectionate but not blinkered, earns its length. A band proud to play without a road map (\u201cSure don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going for,\u201d in the words of one Dead song, \u201cbut I\u2019m going to go for it\u201d), they accidentally gave birth to a community of fans that has continued without them. The musicians, especially but not exclusively Jerry Garcia, whose death in 1995 only technically ended the Dead, prove remarkably articulate about the why and wherefore of their music and the group mind that created it. \u201cThe moment is king,\u201d says bass player Phil Lesh, who died earlier this year. \u201cNo one person can think this all up themselves.\u201d (Stream on Prime Video.) \u2014 R.L.\n\u2018The Velvet Underground\u2019 (2021)\nTodd Haynes\u2019 documentary about a band whose influence is still felt half a century after almost nobody bought their records, mostly resolves the problem of how to make a movie about a musical group who in its relatively short career left almost no film record. Haynes relies on photographs, clips from tangentially relevant ephemeral films and soundless remnants shot by mentor/facilitator Andy Warhol, a strategy that can be distracting and rewarding in turns. But all in all \u201cThe Velvet Underground\u201d adroitly tells the story, elegantly evoking the anti-groovy vibe of the most New York of all New York City bands. Like many rock stories it\u2019s a tale of complementary talents finding mutual inspiration before ego and ambition tear them apart, though not every band leaves such a striking legacy. (Stream on Apple TV+.) \u2014 R.L.\n\u2018Zappa\u2019 (2020)\nIf \u201cThe Velvet Underground\u201d had to contend with limited source material, \u201cZappa\u201d director Alex Winter enjoyed an open door to the vault of a man who recorded everything, filmed much and apparently kept it all. This busy romp through the life, art and times of Frank Zappa is illustrated with clips and photos even ardent fans won\u2019t have seen; commentary from friends, family and collaborators fills out the picture of a very public private person. Winter is more concerned with the serious musician than the scatological comedian, concentrating on the early work with the Mothers of Invention and late-period rehearsals and concerts of the orchestral music Zappa wrote his whole life. \u201cMy desires are simple,\u201d says the composer. \u201cAll I want to do is get a good performance and a good recording of everything I ever wrote, so I can hear it.\u201d (Stream on Tubi, Prime Video and Hulu.) \u2014 R.L.\n\u201820 Feet From Stardom\u2019 (2013)\nMorgan Neville\u2019s Oscar-winning film honors the backup singers, mostly women of color, who added soul to recordings and glamour to stage shows, both Black and white, from the 1960s on. Darlene Love, Claudia Lennear, Merry Clayton, T\u00e1ta Vega and others reflect on discrimination, luck and the difficulty of moving from the background to the spotlight, share career highlights and amusing (and not so amusing) anecdotes. There\u2019s a vein of sadness running through it, as talented women never achieve stardom and changes in taste and production have made even session work more scarce. But through it all there\u2019s the singing, and a lot of it. \u201cThere\u2019s something that happens when you lock in to somebody and all the harmonics ping,\u201d says Sting backup singer Jo Lawry. \u201cI mean, if you don\u2019t like that, what do you like?\u201d (Stream on the Roku Channel.) \u2014 R.L.\n\u2018Always for Pleasure\u2019 (1978)\nMany documentaries by the late, great Les Blank, most set at the intersection of music, culture and food, are available on the Criterion Channel, including \u201cChulas Fronteras\u201d (Tex-Mex norte\u00f1o), \u201cThe Blues According to Lightning Hopkins,\u201d \u201cSpend It All\u201d (Cajun life), and \u201cIn Heaven There Is No Beer\u201d (polka culture). All are worth your time, but I return most often to \u201cAlways for Pleasure,\u201d Blank\u2019s swan dive into the gumbo that is New Orleans \u2014 not the tourist\u2019s version but the ordinary extraordinary life of a city that loves a parade. (Even for a funeral.) Musicians heard, or heard from, include Professor Longhair, Allen Toussaint, the Neville Brothers and the Wild Tchoupitoulas in their beaded, feathered finery, along with many anonymous brass and percussion players. Singer Irma Thomas tells you the way to cook beans. \u201cTreme\u201d fans, you need to see this. (Stream on Kanopy and Criterion Channel.) \u2014 R.L.\n\u2018The Decline of Western Civilization\u2019 (1981)\nPenelope Spheeris\u2019 cult favorite, filmed during not quite the first flush of Los Angeles punk \u2014 the scene was already changing, as the pogoers were elbowed out by the moshers. It\u2019s a sort of black musical comedy about loud, fast bohemianism, performative rebellion and lost youth, arranged around performances by X, the Bags, Black Flag, Fear and others, with musicians visited \u201cat home\u201d (the Germs\u2019 Darby Crash cooks bacon and eggs, X\u2019s John Doe gives Top Jimmy a tattoo, Black Flag frontman Ron Reyes shows off the closet he lives in) and interviews with more and less self-aware fans. Says one of the source of his rage: \u201cliving in the city, and just seeing everything, seeing all the ugly old people\u2026 the buses, and just the dirt.\u201d Locals of a certain age and taste may see old friends, or perhaps themselves. (Stream on Prime Video, Pluto, Kanopy and YouTube.) \u2014 R.L.\n\u2018Patti Smith: Dream of Life\u2019 (2008)\n\u201cLife isn\u2019t some vertical or horizontal line,\u201d says Patti Smith in this nonlinear scrapbook documentary. \u201cYou have your own interior world, and it\u2019s not that neat.\u201d From the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s, professional photographer Steven Sebring followed the poet-singer-punk progenitor across time and space, then rearranged the pieces into an impressionistic collage. Set onstage, backstage, at home and abroad, it creates the non-paradoxical double image of Smith as a person dedicated in an almost religious way to art and as an ordinary mother, daughter, friend \u2014 priestly and intense in performance, goofy and sweet in life. All rock docs should include the subject visiting their parents. Smith: \u201cNobody makes coffee like my dad.\u201d Dad: \u201cDon\u2019t build me up too much.\u201d (Stream on Tubi, Pluto and YouTube.) \u2014 R.L.\n\u2018Summer of Soul (or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised)\u2019 (2021)\nGreat documentaries can make you look at something familiar in a new light, but they can also reclaim history that has long been forgotten \u2014 or was intentionally erased. That\u2019s what happened when Ahmir \u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson made this joyous, Oscar-winning film about the Harlem Cultural Festival, a series of concerts held over the turbulent summer of 1969 at Mount Morris Park (now Marcus Garvey Park) in Harlem. Unlike Woodstock, which took place a few hours up the road that same summer and has been endlessly memorialized since, the Harlem Cultural Festival faded into obscurity. Culled from roughly 40 hours of footage that lay untouched in a basement for decades, \u201cSummer of Soul\u201d features mesmerizing performances by the likes of Stevie Wonder, Nina Simone and B.B. King. News clips and contemporary interviews provide just enough exposition to understand the cultural context, but never get in the way of the magic. (Stream on Hulu.) \u2014 Meredith Blake\n\u2018Tina\u2019 (2021)\nBy the time this documentary came out in 2021, Tina Turner\u2019s life story \u2014 or at least her escape from an abusive marriage to Ike Turner and the triumphant solo career that followed \u2014 was already the stuff of rock legend, familiar to many thanks to the bestselling autobiography \u201cI, Tina\u201d and the Oscar-nominated biopic \u201cWhat\u2019s Love Got to Do With It.\u201d But \u201cTina\u201d sheds powerful light on the singer, who was born Annie Mae Bullock before adopting a stage name selected by Ike, with whom she began performing as an insecure teenager. Filmmakers T.J. Martin and Dan Lindsay don\u2019t shy away from the violence Turner experienced during her marriage, but \u201cTina,\u201d rich with archival clips of Turner\u2019s raw, kinetic live performances, is also a celebration of her singular charisma. Most movingly, it features an extensive interview with Turner herself and marked the superstar\u2019s final appearance before her death in 2023. (Stream on Max.) \u2014 M.B.\n\u2018Yacht Rock: A Dockumentary\u2019 (2024)\nThis delightfully nerdy documentary explores what may be the only musical genre defined retroactively by a bunch of guys making videos at home. But that\u2019s exactly what happened, back in the aughts, when a handful of music enthusiasts in Los Angeles made \u201cYacht Rock,\u201d a series of videos spoofing the mellow-rock stars of the \u201870s and early \u201880s. The series took off, spurring renewed appreciation for the slickly produced sounds of artists like Steely Dan, Michael McDonald and Toto, whose paths crossed in the L.A. music scene in the pre-MTV era. Directed by Garret Price, \u201cYacht Rock\u201d is breezy and fun, but also has an almost academic rigor. You will walk away with a clear definition of what \u2014 and isn\u2019t \u2014 yacht rock, and a deep familiarity with the canonical works of the genre. (Prepare to have \u201cWhat a Fool Believes\u201d in your head for days after viewing.) Many of the key players, including McDonald, Kenny Loggins, Christopher Cross, and the members of Toto appear in interviews, and generally seem to have a good sense of humor about the whole \u201cyacht rock\u201d thing. (One notable exception: Steely Dan\u2019s Donald Fagen, who appears in a single, exceedingly cranky phone call.) (Stream on Max.) \u2014 M.B.\n\u2018The Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart\u2019 (2020)\nThe colossal success of the \u201cSaturday Night Fever\u201d soundtrack meant that the Bee Gees became synonymous with disco, but as this documentary makes clear, there was much more to the Brothers Gibb, who were too versatile and talented to be confined to a single genre. (All that anti-disco fervor was pretty misguided, anyway.) Director Frank Marshall tells the story of how Barry, Maurice and Robin Gibb relocated from Australia to England in the 1960s and began churning out hit records. As their popularity rose and fell over the years, the group evolved to stay with the times: Barry improvised a high-pitched falsetto that became the Bee Gees\u2019 signature, and they got on the disco bandwagon. The film includes fascinating stories about the origins of some of their hits, like the sound of a car crossing a bridge that inspired the rhythmic hook of \u201cJive Talkin\u2019.\u201d \u201cHow Can You Mend a Broken Heart\u201d is a celebration of a group that was wrongly maligned, but it\u2019s also a bittersweet tribute to brotherhood. (Stream on Max.) \u2014 M.B.\n\u2018The Greatest Night in Pop\u2019 (2024)\nIf you grew up in the 1980s, you probably heard \u201cWe Are the World\u201d hundreds of times on the radio and knew the charity single, released in 1985, was created to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. But chances are you gave much less thought to the massive logistical effort that went into corralling dozens of music legends, with their colossal egos and equally voluminous hair, into a Los Angeles studio to record the song. Directed by Bao Nguyen, \u201cThe Greatest Night in Pop\u201d tells the supremely entertaining story of how Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson wrote the song and managed to assemble an all-star squad, including Bob Dylan, Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, Diana Ross and Tina Turner, to cut the track on one long, sleepless night after the American Music Awards. The documentary is surprisingly suspenseful \u2014 you\u2019ll find yourself waiting with baited breath to see if Prince shows up or find out which artists will get solo verses, even if you already know the answer \u2014 and smartly attuned to celebrity excesses of the era. A moving and funny slice of \u201880s nostalgia, \u201cThe Greatest Night in Pop\u201d will make you appreciate the genius of producer Quincy Jones, appreciate the stamina of Richie, who also hosted the AMAs that night, and long for the days when pop music felt, somehow, bigger than it does now. (Stream on Netflix.) \u2014 M.B.\n\u2018Milli Vanilli\u2019 (2023)\nBefore they became an international punchline, Milli Vanilli was one of the biggest pop acts of the late 1980s and early 1990s. With their striking looks and distinctive style, the duo of Fabrice Morvan and Rob Pilatus were tailor-made for the MTV era. But as the world eventually learned, they didn\u2019t sing a single note on their multiplatinum debut album, \u201cGirl You Know It\u2019s True.\u201d In a scheme devised by German producer Frank Farian, they lip-synced to music recorded by other, less telegenic artists. For many years, the Milli Vanilli scandal has been viewed as a semi-farcical cautionary tale about seeking fame at any price. But \u201cMilli Vanilli\u201d reframes the ordeal as a tragic story about the exploitation of artists \u2014 particularly Black artists \u2014 in the music industry. (Stream on Paramount+.) \u2014 M.B.\n\u2018Nothing Compares\u2019 (2022)\nOn Oct 3, 1992, Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor tore up a picture of Pope John Paul II on \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d effectively destroying her mainstream pop career with a single act of protest against the Catholic Church. Her death three decades later in 2023 triggered a flurry of posthumous appreciations that argued she was right all along. Directed by Kathryn Ferguson and released the year before her untimely passing, \u201cNothing Compares\u201d offers a sympathetic reappraisal of O\u2019Connor as a celebrity who was brutally canceled for speaking the truth and was one of many high-profile women vilified as \u201ccrazy\u201d in the 1990s and 2000s. The centerpiece of the film is an extensive interview with O\u2019Connor, who reflects on her traumatic childhood, her unlikely ascent to global stardom and the vicious backlash she faced. The film celebrates the raw, emotive power of her music, her willingness to call out injustice wherever she saw it and a one-of-a-kind image that rejected everything expected of a young, female star in an era of slick pop. (Stream on Paramount+.) \u2014 M.B.\n\u2018Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck\u2019 (2015)\nDirector Brett Morgen spent years sifting through Kurt Cobain\u2019s personal archives to make this film, which presents a layered, startlingly intimate portrait of the late Nirvana frontman. Using art work, journal entries, audio recordings and Super 8 footage of a towheaded Cobain playing a toy guitar, \u201cMontage of Heck\u201d shows how the singer channeled childhood anguish \u2014 especially the upheaval caused by his parents\u2019 divorce \u2014 into his music and eventually become an ill-at-ease Gen X icon. It resists many rock doc cliches, opting for interviews with Cobain\u2019s immediate family, bandmate Krist Novoselic and wife Courtney Love, rather than using a parade of talking heads to explain Nirvana\u2019s impact. The result is not hagiography, but a revealing glimpse inside the too-brief life of an artist as tormented as he was talented. (Stream on Max.) \u2014 M.B.\n\u2018Dear Mama: The Saga of Afeni and Tupac Shakur\u2019 (2023)\nThis five-part docuseries stands out in a crowded sea of musical biographies because of the thoughtful way it connects Afeni Shakur\u2019s radical political activism to her son\u2019s musical legacy. Directed by Allen Hughes, who also helmed the Emmy-winning series \u201cThe Defiant Ones,\u201d \u201cDear Mama\u201d unfolds chronologically, presenting richly detailed portraits of mother and son. We learn how Afeni, bright and ambitious, joined the Black Panther Party in New York, successfully defended herself in court with no formal training and later struggled with drug addiction. And we meet Tupac, who was murdered in 1996 at 25, as a bright, sensitive teenager with a gift for words who would go on to become synonymous with West Coast gangsta rap. The series draws fascinating parallels between Tupac and Afeni, whose relationship was sometimes strained despite their similarities. (Stream on Hulu.) \u2014 M.B.\n\u2018Whitney\u2019 (2018)\nDirected by Kevin McDonald, who also made the excellent \u201cMarley,\u201d this heartbreaking documentary sheds light on the personal demons that tormented Whitney Houston for years before her untimely death by accidental drowning at 48. With a transcendent voice and statuesque beauty, Houston may have been destined to become one of the biggest pop stars of the MTV era, but as \u201cWhitney\u201d argues, the sacrifice and denial that enabled her stratospheric success may have also paved the way for her tragic end. Unlike other documentaries about the late pop icon, it was made with the participation of the Houston family, including her mother, singer Cissy Houston, two brothers and ex-husband, Bobby Brown. As a result, McDonald had access to Houston\u2019s music, including her gospel-infused rendition of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner,\u201d which is dissected at length, as well as a trove of revealing home movies and photographs. But the Houstons\u2019 cooperation does not shield them from scrutiny; one observer notes how Houston was treated like an ATM machine by her loved ones. \u201cWhitney\u201d candidly addresses long-standing questions about Houston\u2019s sexuality and her relationship with Robyn Crawford, and deftly explores the minefield she had to navigate as a Black woman trying to please Black and white audiences alike. (Stream on Netflix.) \u2014 M.B."

      "text": "- Share via\nForty-eight hours of torrential downpour betray the natural logic of Los Angeles. Submerged roadways, mudslides and record-setting rainfall have transformed the Southland city into an obstacle course out of the apocalypse, the very scene you\u2019d see in a movie before everything goes full dystopia. Withstanding extreme conditions is nothing new for Michael Arceneaux, who has made a career out of navigating unstable ground. Today is just another Wednesday.\nAs we sit to talk on the balcony of his Koreatown apartment, seven stories up, the rain has finally stopped despite a procession of chubby gray clouds that hang like prop art in the sky, threatening to disrupt what momentary peace we\u2019ve found. For now the storm is over. The context is appropriate given what Arceneaux, 39, has faced in the last year, losing his mother to cancer in October. And a close friend before that. \u201cI am in my sad boy era,\u201d he jokes.\nI want to tell him that storms don\u2019t last forever but people in the midst of intense grief don\u2019t need cheesy Hallmark cliches. Instead, I promise to listen and be there for him. It has been a great fortune of mine to call Michael a friend since 2004. The orbit of our friendship began that summer, before either of us made it as writers, and what I knew of him then is even more vivid and electric now: He is as genuine, witty and insightful as they come.\n\u201cGrief is just a really uncomfortable subject.\u201d\n\u2014 Michael Arceneaux\nMichael grew up the middle child in a subdivision of Houston named Windsor Village. He attended Howard University, where he studied broadcast journalism, and later started the Cynical Ones, a blog that earned him the reputation as an original voice on matters of race, politics and pop culture. He\u2019s written for just about everybody \u2014 the Washington Post, Rolling Stone, the New York Times, Ebony, Essence \u2014 and is currently developing a TV series inspired by his first memoir of essays.\nMichael\u2019s latest book, \u201cI Finally Bought Some Jordans\u201d (out March 12), is a profoundly felt coda to his \u201cI\u201d trilogy, which began in 2018 with \u201cI Can\u2019t Date Jesus,\u201d a New York Times bestseller, and was followed by \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Die Poor\u201d in 2020, an essay collection about debt and shame. \u201cJordans\u201d is a noticeable detour from those previous offerings \u2014 its centerpiece is grief.\nJason Parham on leaving Los Angeles for New York: \u2018What I sought in the story of this new frame was a rejection of stasis. What I went looking for in New York was the person I always dreamed of being in Los Angeles.\u2019\nThrough a series of serpentine encounters, touring from New York City to Houston to L.A., with the COVID-19 pandemic as its backdrop, the book addresses millennial angst and its many challenges. Throughout, Michael prevails as his characteristically funny self, scrutinizing au courant artwork (on \u201cSlave Play\u201d: \u201cIt makes you think. Much of what I thought throughout the play was, What the f\u2014?\u201d) while learning to find joy in middle age and local Tex-Mex delicacies, like the crab nachos from Cyclone Anaya\u2019s, a beloved Houston eatery.\nStill, the reality of what he\u2019s weathered can\u2019t be avoided. \u201cGrief is just a really uncomfortable subject.\u201d He tells me he didn\u2019t want to avoid it. That he couldn\u2019t. That he had to write about it. Write through it. So that\u2019s exactly what he did.\nJason Parham: Prepping for the interview I realized it\u2019s been 20 years, this year, that we\u2019ve known each other.\nMichael Arceneaux: It has.\nJP: I\u2019ve always admired how gracious you are when greeting folks. So I\u2019d like to begin where you always begin with me. How are you?\nMA: I\u2019m actually having a really difficult time. Last year was the worst year of my life. I\u2019m really deep in grief. But I have no choice but to pull it together to an extent because I don\u2019t want this [book] to fail. And I don\u2019t want to fail.\nJP: I wouldn\u2019t call three books a failure.\nMA: No. But I always worried about how Zora Neale Hurston died poor. If not for Alice Walker, literally all of her work would be lost. And that\u2019s the case for a lot of Black writers and creatives. Not to be overly cynical \u2014 and this was something I told my mom because it was how I felt \u2014 I\u2019m like, \u2018I would probably be more valuable dead than alive.\u2019 In my mind I already know how that goes, and it\u2019s very true of a lot of people.\nJP: Too many people.\nMA: The point of the book is, I thought I would be in a certain place. I\u2019ve made some strides that I\u2019m happy with, but it\u2019s not exactly what I thought it would be. And a lot of that stuff is beyond my control. That\u2019s always been the case. It\u2019s about accepting that. I\u2019m very self-critical, and while I don\u2019t want to value my work solely by monetary meaning, it\u2019s hard to ignore that no matter how successful you\u2019ve been or appear to be.\nIt\u2019s a hard time to be a creative. There\u2019s a real devaluing of what I do for a living. It\u2019s unsettling. The [Hollywood writers] strike was really painful. Last year, like a lot of people, I felt it. It didn\u2019t matter what level you were at \u2014 especially if you were Black. The discomfort is a wake-up call.\nJP: It\u2019s so different from when we started. You created a blog in 2005, the Cynical Ones. Are you nostalgic at all for that time in media?\nMA: I wouldn\u2019t say nostalgic. Something I wrestle with is that my writing and my pursuits kept me away from my mom. Ultimately I have to find my way and see things through. I\u2019m not the first person to say this, but I\u2019m learning in grief that I am a different person after losing her. Part of that is rediscovering an actual love of writing. This is a roundabout way of saying maybe I should do a newsletter. Maybe it can be something I play with. Because I started a blog to find my voice and get better as a writer. Samantha Irby has told me to do one forever. She has one where she does Judge Mathis recaps.\nDJ Quik discusses legacy, L.A. music, Death Row records\nJP: Wait, really?\nMA: Yes, it\u2019s hilarious. I highly recommend it. Clearly I have a lot of complaints, but I still want to enjoy this. I didn\u2019t put so much work and effort into this to not enjoy it. So much of what my ambition was rooted in is now a reward that can\u2019t be given. It\u2019s become, \u2018How can I continue to enjoy what I\u2019m writing?\u2019\nJP: That\u2019s important.\nMA: I don\u2019t say this arrogantly, but anybody that\u2019s both Black and queer, being pioneering is exhausting. You\u2019re constantly having to change people\u2019s perceptions. And in this climate it\u2019s harder than ever.\nJP: Rarely is Black art allowed to just exist.\n\u201cI\u2019m not the first person to say this, but I\u2019m learning in grief that I am a different person after losing her.\u201d\n\u2014 Michael Arceneaux\nMA: I get the critique about that. Unfortunately, we live in the world as is and not how we want it to be. But if you very much stick to your voice and commit to it, all of that will shine through. I always remember how hard it was to get \u201cI Can\u2019t Date Jesus\u201d published because everything mirrors that process, in that people have very limited ideas of what they think queer means, what gay means, what Black means, how that presents, what that sounds like. I hear the dumbest things. The same things I heard in publishing I hear even worse in television, even if it\u2019s delivered with a smile. I\u2019m exhausted from dealing with people\u2019s prejudice.\nJP: Was writing always your path?\nMA: I was pushed into freelancing. I\u2019m disappointed more writers are being pushed into it because people who don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing are running companies into the ground, and everybody else is left to deal with it. A lot of the lamenting I\u2019ve seen for media this year, I didn\u2019t see that for all the Black media that was decimated a decade ago. And it doesn\u2019t make what\u2019s going on now any less awful, but it\u2019s been an obvious problem for a while.\nThe filmmaker\u2019s movies were hard and unflinching in their portrayal of Black Los Angeles but really what they are about is our fundamental human enterprise: the grace of feeling.\nJP: You wrestle with that sentiment quite beautifully in the book, the difficulty in shouldering collective grief \u2014 what\u2019s happening in the world \u2014 alongside private grief.\nMA: I was very adamant during the promotion of my first book \u2014 because I felt it already happening \u2014 about not being boxed in. I didn\u2019t want to be that sad gay person. I didn\u2019t want to perpetuate certain tropes. Not that I carry that burden but it was in the back of my mind. That said, initially I had an idea of what I wanted the most recent book to be when I had a different title. Then life happened. It forced me to be more honest about how I felt, even about things I thought were settled. Clearly a block was there.\nWhen I told my mom about the book, she said, \u2018You\u2019re angry.\u2019 I didn\u2019t think so, but I did recognize that there were unresolved feelings from my childhood. Now it\u2019s become about accepting that some things won\u2019t change. You won\u2019t necessarily get that happy ending. I intended for this trio of books to end on a brighter note as I enter middle age, but life doesn\u2019t work that way. Look at what\u2019s happening around us.\nJP: But I think the book is more relatable that way. More human. Life takes a curve; sure, it\u2019s not what you expected, but you do your best to find hope and humor in the darkness. And maybe that hope takes the form of a haircut. You write about how getting a cut was a small way of regaining control. We\u2019re the same in that we believe in the restorative power of a fade. There\u2019s almost nothing that a fresh cut can\u2019t fix, even if only momentarily.\nMA: There are people whose lives were destroyed when the plague happened and I want to acknowledge that. I worked really hard to make the first book happen. Going into the second book, it was about trying to get over life\u2019s humps. Overall I was still fortunate that year. But I was struggling in the apartment I was in, in such a small space. I was alone. I\u2019m not with my family. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. I\u2019d already experienced COVID, so I knew what it felt like.\nThe second book wasn\u2019t the most important thing but I wanted it to reach people. I couldn\u2019t do it at my best so I wanted something that I could have \u2014 and that was getting a cut up the street. It\u2019s very vain and small, but other people were being much more selfish than I was. Catholic guilt is forever. A little bit of me was like, I\u2019m triflin\u2019 but not as triflin\u2019. I wanted to feel like a bad bitch, and that\u2019s the best I could get in such a dire situation.\nJP: In one essay, you dig into the political elite \u2014 Barack Obama, Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden, Eric Adams \u2014 and the limits of symbolism. How representation for the sake of representation doesn\u2019t generate progress in the way some people seem to think, and how minorities bear the disproportionate brunt of their failures. November is around the corner. How f\u2014ed are we?\nMA: I don\u2019t really believe in polling but I did see that even if Trump is convicted he is still within the margin of error. It\u2019s an old man and a criminal. I\u2019m trying to not be disparaging. They\u2019re both old but Trump is crazy, and crazy presents a certain energy. I think we\u2019re f\u2014ed. A few convictions might actually complicate the situation. Still, I don\u2019t know.\nAn exhibition at REDCAT is built on Octavia E. Butler\u2019s \u201cParable of the Sower.\u201d Its creator, American Artist, talks with Tananarive Due.\nThere\u2019s this conversation happening on why Biden is not getting credit for the economy. But then half of Americans say they can\u2019t afford to pay rent. And it\u2019s grossly underreported. A lot of people are very discouraged.\nJP: More than we probably even realize.\nMA: People are not being spoken to. And there is this arrogance to [how Biden operates]. Like, he won\u2019t apologize for his role in the massive death of Palestinians. It\u2019s indecent in and of itself. But it\u2019s not politically expedient. Now he\u2019s prone to losing Michigan and Georgia, and it comes off like he doesn\u2019t even care. They keep telling Black people to be grateful. The whole stimulus check thing, for example. They keep telling us we\u2019re misinformed. It\u2019s condescending to working-class Black people, who are the majority of us.\nBlack people have a right to be disappointed and not happy that this 80-year-old man has not done as much as he claims to do. Some people wanted to shut down the police altogether. He said no, no, no \u2014 rock this police bill. He said, \u2018Democracy is so important.\u2019 But they didn\u2019t pass that voting rights bill. Maybe it would have failed either way, but he didn\u2019t exert that much public pressure. Now we\u2019re supposed to be guilted into it. Barack and Michelle are gonna come wagging their fingers and say, \u2018Hit Pookie, tell him to vote.\u2019 Pookie got every right to be disenchanted. Maybe it\u2019s not articulated the best way, but people have a right to be disappointed. People are suffering and those $1200 checks meant a lot because it was the first time in their life where they felt like the government actually put money in their pocket. And if you can\u2019t understand that on a basic level, you are screwed.\n\u201cI wanted to feel like a bad bitch, and that\u2019s the best I could get in such a dire situation.\u201d\n\u2014 Michael Arceneaux\nJP: Is there just less empathy these days?\nMA: I think so. I mention in the book about a friend, Brian, who passed away from brain cancer. I started waking up in the middle of the night because my sleep pattern was off. I now realize that was my grief. A week ago I woke up and heard that Nicki Minaj diss record, \u201cBig Foot.\u201d There\u2019s a line about Megan [Thee Stallion] lying on her dead momma. Then the memes started. That\u2019s what I mean. There is a level of depravity now that is a lot more casual than it should be.\nJP: There\u2019s been a noticeable shift in the national mood for sure. Almost like one world is ending and another is beginning.\nMA: I\u2019ve joked in TV meetings that it could be illegal to be gay in a year [laughs]. I have that on my mind. Being from Texas, and what\u2019s happening there, Texas is very much a template with what [Republicans] want to do with the rest of the country. So when people say, \u2018How can you live in this multicultural society and still live in repression,\u2019 I\u2019m like, well look at Houston, the most ethnically diverse city in the country.\nJP: Things feel noticeably scarier than 2016.\nMA: It does. Especially because of my skin and I hate slavery [laughs]. My only hope is that Trump is crazy and who knows what he will say. Crazy is not very reliable.\nProducer: Ashley Woeber\nGrooming: Arielle Park\nPhoto Assistant: Alma Lucia\nStyling Assistant: Ryan Phung\nLocation: Hollyhock House\nJason Parham is a senior writer at Wired and a regular contributor to Image."

      "text": "Remembering the Music of Idiosyncratic Tim Buckley\n- Share via\n\u201cThis world was never meant for one as beautiful as you\u201d was the line Don McLean wrote about Vincent van Gogh in \u201cVincent,\u201d but it could apply as fittingly to \u201860s-\u201970s singer-songwriter Tim Buckley, whose ethereally beautiful voice was silenced when Buckley overdosed on heroin in 1975.\nThe Washington D.C-born, Anaheim-reared musician never fit into one mold. He started out as a quintessentially sensitive folk singer with an uncommonly gorgeous and flexible voice, morphed into a folk-rocker then took a series of drastic left turns into jazz-rock, avant garde explorations and sexually charged white funk.\nBuckley also never gave much consideration to the marketplace, typically following his muse despite the conniptions it gave those who were trying to promote him to the masses.\nA new double-CD set assembled by Elektra Records--the label that first signed him--and Rhino Records documents the idiosyncratic path Buckley took during his eight-year recording career--from his 1966 debut, \u201cTim Buckley,\u201d through 1974\u2019s \u201cLook at the Fool.\u201d Another single disc from Manifesto Records features unreleased material from two very different periods during that career.\n*** 1/2 Tim Buckley, \u201cMorning Glory--The Tim Buckley Anthology,\u201d Elektra Traditions/Rhino. What most set Buckley apart from other \u201860s folkies was his voice--high, pure, at times even angelic. It infused his music with an otherworldly plaintiveness.\nThe main essay in the 32-page CD booklet by Barry Alfonso doesn\u2019t get much into his family\u2019s background, but he grew up with a verbally and sometimes physically abusive father who\u2019d suffered a head injury during World War II, while his mother was said to be chronically critical of her son. That laid the foundation for the low self-esteem that came out increasingly as his musical career unfolded.\nHe was a student at Anaheim\u2019s Loara High School when he met two friends who would be his main musical partners for years--bassist Jim Fielder (later with Blood, Sweat & Tears) and aspiring poet Larry Beckett, who supplied most of the lyrics to the songs they wrote together.\nBuckley\u2019s first album showcased his exceptional voice on songs that at times were self-consciously poetic, though very much in keeping with the times.\nHe ventured into psychedelia and political protest with his second album, 1967\u2019s \u201cGoodbye and Hello,\u201d but he was still most at home when singing of romance. It was here he started treating his voice less as a conduit for Beckett\u2019s lyrics than as another musical instrument whose boundaries he yearned to expand. He eventually incorporated growls, yelps, screams, whines, cackles and off-key shouts.\nBy his third album, 1968\u2019s \u201cHappy Sad,\u201d Buckley seemed to hit his stride with a work with few direct comparisons in pop, but hews closest to the free-spirited rock-jazz excursions of Van Morrison\u2019s seminal \u201cAstral Weeks\u201d album from about the same period. Lyrics became less important than mood, as Buckley added jazz vibraphonist David Friedman prominently into the musical mix. It charted higher than any of his other albums, but still peaked only at No. 81.\nRather than continue down that road, he returned to more conventional folk-rock forms with 1969\u2019s \u201cBlue Afternoon.\u201d \u201cChase the Blues Away\u201d from that album might have laid the foundation for Chris Isaak\u2019s moodily romantic career, and Buckley\u2019s hypnotic late-night sound foreshadowed that of Cowboy Junkies.\nHis work took some truly dramatic turns after that, careening from 1970\u2019s \u201cLorca,\u201d inspired by the fatalistic view of romance of Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca, to \u201cStarsailor,\u201d the 1970 album that includes \u201cSong to the Siren,\u201d probably the most revered song in his catalog, on through \u201cGreetings From L.A.,\u201d \u201cSefronia\u201d and \u201cLook at the Fool,\u201d inconsistent albums that often came off as blatant--even desperate--stabs at commercial success.\nThe 2-CD set includes three songs from \u201cGreetings\u201d and just one apiece from its two successors, \u201cSefronia\u201d (1973)--with its powerfully obsessed reinvention of the Jaynetts\u2019 1963 hit \u201cSally Go \u2018 Round the Roses\u201d--and \u201cLook at the Fool.\u201d They serve more to trace the curious end to a once-promising career than to highlight his continued output. By comparison, 14 songs come from those first three albums.\nThe CD booklet makes no reference to his short marriage in the mid-\u201960s to Mary Guibert, nor to their son, Jeff Buckley, whose highly promising career was cut short when he accidentally drowned in 1997 while swimming in the Mississippi River. Perhaps, then, it\u2019s no surprise this set doesn\u2019t include \u201cI Never Asked to Be Your Mountain,\u201d a song from \u201cGoodbye and Hello\u201d that dealt with Buckley\u2019s estrangement from Guibert and from the son who was born after they divorced.\n*** Tim Buckley, \u201cThe Dream Belongs To Me--Rare and Unreleased Recordings 1968/1973,\u201d Manifesto. The five-year gap between the dates of these two batches of outtakes and alternate versions of songs gives a quick look at the different sides of Buckley\u2019s music. They almost paint a portrait of a split personality between the folk and jazz-tinged romanticism of the earlier works and the hard-charging funk and rock of the latter songs. This is by no means an introduction to Buckley\u2019s music, but an often fascinating appendix to one singular musician\u2019s career.\nAlbums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars (good) and four stars (excellent)."

      "text": "Get under the surface fun of \u2018Palm Springs\u2019 with Cristin Milioti and Andy Samberg\n- Share via\n\u201cPalm Springs\u201d came out in what qualifies in quarantine time as 14 millenniums ago (or was it yesterday? It was July 10, for the record), but stars Cristin Milioti and Andy Samberg are still tickled to answer questions about it. Luckily for them, the Easter egg-packed time-loop comedy rewards repeat viewing.\n\u201cTo be still talking about a movie this long after it comes out is what you dream. So I\u2019m happy to talk about it as much as anyone wants to,\u201d Samberg says.\nIn a separate video call, Milioti says, \u201cThe wild ride of it has changed because first it was like, \u2018Oh my God, I can\u2019t believe we broke a record at Sundance [by 69 cents, Samberg has happily pointed out in the past \u2014 the distributor Neon paid $17,500,000.69 to acquire it, topping the $17,500,000 paid by then-Fox Searchlight for Nate Parker\u2019s \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d], then it was like, \u2018Oh my God, I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re releasing this movie. Now it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh my God, I can\u2019t believe that this little movie is still having such a life.\u2019 \u201d\nBy now, they\u2019ve heard all the time-loop jokes stemming from the pandemic, how \u201cPalm Springs\u201d is a fitting movie for this seemingly endless moment. After all, the predicament of two people waking up to the same routine forever is more relatable than usual these days. But they\u2019re also hearing the film has stayed with people more than most comedies might. It\u2019s not just the tricks of finding new meaning in scenes when watching again. There\u2019s something else rewarding in there, beneath the sweet-but-rocky romance and the \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d magic. There\u2019s something to which people are relating.\nAndy Samberg and Cristin Milioti are trapped in the same day, repeating endlessly. There\u2019s existential dread and despair. It\u2019s a comedy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been about the desperation of wanting to escape yourself; the time loop is almost superfluous. And weirdly, I\u2019ve been thinking about it a lot lately,\u201d says Milioti, wistfully musing about how the snow in New York City, where she is, has accentuated the unnatural stillness of this time.\n\u201cOne of the things I loved about this is that she is going to be fine without him,\u201d she says of her character, Sarah, in the romance with Samberg\u2019s character, Nyles. \u201cSome people don\u2019t think that\u2019s romantic. I actually think that\u2019s wildly romantic to say, \u2018I know that I could be OK. I\u2019m choosing this. This is a daily choice.\u2019 They are both really difficult people to be around. I mean, they\u2019re also great,\u201d she says, saucer eyes becoming salad plates for emphasis.\nMilioti embraces the not-so-greatness that made Sarah\u2019s family treat her like \u201ca throbbing radioactive zone: She makes everything about herself. She shows up drunk to everything, she\u2019s a mess. She takes up so much energy and space and she\u2019s exhausting to be around. And she\u2019s a human in pain. I love that, because that is very true too.\n\u201cHurt people hurt people. The explosions can distract from all the stuff you\u2019re trying to run away from. So I always looked at her as this wildly sympathetic character.\u201d\nUnlike most rom-coms, \u201cPalm Springs\u201d addresses the work that must be done \u2014 in a relationship and on oneself \u2014 to come anywhere near something like fulfillment.\n\u201cYou can tell a lot about a person\u2019s personality based on the rom-coms they connect with,\u201d Samberg says. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s the ones that are a little messier. I like \u2018When Harry Met Sally\u2019 and \u2018Always Be My Maybe.\u2019 The ones that feel real, where you can see the time spent together and the shorthand and delighting in one another\u2019s peculiarities.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always described my marriage like it\u2019s a slumber party that\u2019s just never ending; that feeling of \u2018I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re getting away with this.\u2019 The goal with \u2018Palm Springs\u2019 was to try and split the difference between a broad studio rom-com and \u2018Punch Drunk Love.\u2019 You know, an indie mixed with existential dread.\u201d\nThe comparisons to other time-loop films don\u2019t bother Samberg at all.\n\u201cAs someone who is a huge fan, obviously, of \u2018Groundhog Day,\u2019 and honestly, \u2018Edge of Tomorrow\u2019 and now \u2018Russian Doll\u2019 \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of really good time loop content. The thing I really liked about this one was it assumes you\u2019ve seen those and it starts sort of past the end of \u2018Groundhog Day.\u2019 What if Bill Murray didn\u2019t get out and was there for anywhere from 40 to 1,000 years? And there were other people in it too?\n\u201cI always want to make things that reward people for what they\u2019ve already seen and assume that they know what I know, having spent my life watching as much as humanly possible,\u201d he says.\nHe\u2019s quick to point out that \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d while a rom-com, also has its share of existential dread. That sounds about right for \u201cPalm Springs\u2019\u201d protagonists in an endlessly repeating cycle, finding they can neither escape nor build anything lasting.\nMilioti notes that screenwriter Andy Siara has said the film also throws depression into the mix. \u201cThat\u2019s what depression feels like,\u201d the actress says. \u201cYou wake up every day and you replay the worst things that you\u2019ve done or the worst things about yourself and you can\u2019t escape them.\u201d\nYes, this is a comedy. There are many funny moments. But there\u2019s also floating, and not in a good way. For whatever self-destructive qualities Sarah has, she has the capacity to be bravely proactive.\nSamberg\u2019s Nyles, by contrast, thinks, \u201cI just wanna float and not think about anything because that\u2019s all I am now,\u201d says the actor, who also co-produced. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of people that can relate to that feeling in one way, shape or form. The movie asks, \u2018Is there a way back from that?\u2019 And \u2018Can you learn to love yourself enough to let love into your life again?\u2019 You really hope the answer is \u2018Yes.\u2019\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we were kind of chasing: \u2018Is there meaning to any of it?\u2019 And even if everything is meaningless, you can still find meaning in sharing love and feeling some version of happiness and positivity while we\u2019re going through it. Somebody to pet your head while you\u2019re breaking down and crying about the meaninglessness of it all.\u201d"

      "text": "Amy Berg\u2019s newest dark movie isn\u2019t a documentary -- finally\n- Share via\nAfter directing \u201cDeliver Us From Evil,\u201d her Oscar-nominated 2006 documentary chronicling sex-abuse cases in the Roman Catholic Church, Amy Berg set her sights on directing a narrative feature.\n\u201cSince \u2018Deliver Us From Evil,\u2019 I have been getting a lot of scripts and a lot of meetings with people,\u201d the 44-year-old Berg said at the quaint Venice home she shares with her dogs.\n\u201cI am totally creatively satisfied making documentaries, but I do enjoy the idea \u2014 this is going to sound really strange \u2014 of taking on something that is not so real and the stakes aren\u2019t so high.\u201d\n------------\nFOR THE RECORD:\nAmy Berg: A May 10 Calendar article on filmmaker Amy Berg misstated the title of her forthcoming documentary on child sexual abuse in Hollywood. It is \u201cAn Open Secret,\u201d not \u201cOpen Secret.\u201d \u2014\n------------\nBut the stakes are high for the characters in her dark first narrative feature, \u201cEvery Secret Thing,\u201d which opens May 15 in theaters, On Demand and on iTunes.\nBased on the novel by Laura Lippman, the psychological thriller stars Elizabeth Banks as Nancy, a police detective racked with guilt for not saving the life of a baby who had been kidnapped by two young girls. Now eight years later, Ronnie (Dakota Fanning) and Alice (Danielle Macdonald) are back home from juvenile detention and are the prime suspects when another young child goes missing.\nDiane Lane also stars as Helen, Alice\u2019s mother, who seems to care more for Ronnie then her overweight, unmotivated daughter.\nBerg was at the Sundance Film Festival premiering \u201cWest of Memphis,\u201d her critically acclaimed 2012 documentary about the failure of the justice system in the prosecution of three teenagers for the death of three young boys, when she received a text from actress Frances McDormand requesting that the two should meet.\nMcDormand, executive producer of \u201cEvery Secret Thing,\u201d had optioned Lippman\u2019s book several years earlier. Berg flew to New York to meet with her and producer Anthony Bregman about the project. She got a quick education in the art of putting together a feature film.\n\u201cIt kind of lined up right away,\u201d Berg recalled. \u201cThere was some interest in Diane Lane, so I met her pretty quickly. I think that\u2019s how it works with a feature. You get a couple of things attached and suddenly the trains are on the track.\u201d\nBerg wasn\u2019t the first director attached to the project. The film\u2019s screenwriter, Nicole Holofcener, who has written and directed such perceptively funny female-centric indie comedies as 2006\u2019s \u201cFriends With Money\u201d and 2013\u2019s \u201cEnough Said,\u201d was originally slated to direct the film.\n\u201cI read [the book] and thought it was a fun challenge to do this,\u201d said Holofcener by phone. \u201cIt\u2019s so different than anything I had ever done. I had never adapted a book. I did many rewrites based on notes from Anthony and Fran and my writer friends. I met with Diane. I was ready to get involved and I guess you could say, I chickened out. I really couldn\u2019t deal with the baby stuff.\u201d\nHolofcener, who is the mother of two children, hadn\u2019t any problems adapting the book. \u201cI was drawn to the material because I really liked dark stories and dark movies,\u201d she said. Directing was another story. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t have to cast the baby. Once I thought about having to live with the screaming baby voice in the editing room for days and days, I couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\nThe original focus of the story, Berg said, was more on Banks\u2019 character\u2019s home life and her desire to have a child.\n\u201cIt just seemed more interesting to keep her personal life out of the movie,\u201d Berg said. \u201cI think it needed to stay focused on the girls. That is the most interesting thing \u2014 the relationship between the two girls and Diane Lane\u2019s character and her daughter.\u201d\nBerg had seen that kind of relationship when she was an ice skater as a youngster. \u201cI remember the ice skating parents \u2014 my parents weren\u2019t like this \u2014 who were so intensely all over the kids to make it to the Olympics or whatever. I thought that was such an unbelievable amount of pressure to grow up with \u2014 a parent who wants you to be what you couldn\u2019t be. That\u2019s really what Diane\u2019s character is.\u201d\nBerg discovered doing a narrative feature was a \u201cbackward way of working compared to a documentary, where you kind of find a story in the edit bay. Obviously with a feature, it is 100% on the page.\u201d\nTime also wasn\u2019t on Berg\u2019s side. She worked 3\u00bd years on \u201cWest of Memphis\u201d; her shooting schedule on \u201cEvery Secret Thing\u201d was 21 days.\n\u201cWe shot around Queens,\u201d she said. \u201cI had six weeks of prep, and when I got to New York that went down to four weeks. It was super challenging. We were shooting seven scenes a day, and the editing schedule was really tight \u2014 12 weeks. We ended up getting another four weeks. I\u2019m used to doing six months in the edit bay with hundreds of hours of footage. I learned a lot.\u201d\n\u201cEvery Secret Thing,\u201d which she made in 2013, premiered last year at the Tribeca Film Festival (early reviews were mixed). And since then she\u2019s been juggling several projects.\n\u201cOpen Secret,\u201d her documentary on child sexual abuse in Hollywood, is screening at Cannes and will open theatrically in June. \u201cProphet\u2019s Prey,\u201d her documentary on Warren Jeffs, the former leader of the polygamist sect Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints and convicted felon, premiered at Sundance in January and will open theatrically this fall before it airs on Showtime.\nMeanwhile, Berg is editing her documentary on singer Janis Joplin. \u201cIt\u2019s about her complicated life that was created by her fame and how she struggled as an artist,\u201d said Berg, who has worked on the film for more than seven years. \u201cI find her so powerful. She broke ground for women today. She was a really ahead of her time.\u201d\nBerg hopes to shoot her second narrative feature next year. This time, she\u2019s writing her own screenplay based on the book \u201cSeductive Poison: A Jonestown Survivor\u2019s Story of Life and Death in the Peoples Temple,\u201d written by Deborah Layton, who at one point had been a trusted aide of cult leader Jim jones.\nAs her film choices indicate, Berg has never shied from difficult subject matter.\n\u201cI think I have always been concerned about the underdog,\u201d she said. \u201cThe voices that we don\u2019t hear about. I think this is my way of doing something about it. I feel that this is the kind of perfect job for me. I am able to use a poetic device to tell these things. I don\u2019t think I could do anything else.\u201d"

      "text": "\u2018Sketches\u2019 for Her Son\n- Share via\nEvery time the late Jeff Buckley read a profile or review about him or his music during the boldly original singer-songwriter\u2019s tragically brief career, he found himself linked with one of his parents. Somewhere in the article would always be a mention of his father, Tim Buckley, a richly talented songwriter who died of a heroin overdose in 1975 at age 28.\nThe difficult thing for Buckley in seeing his name constantly tied to his father is that the two had almost no personal connection in life. Tim Buckley\u2019s year-plus marriage to Mary Guibert ended before she gave birth to their son in 1966 in Anaheim.\n\u201cEverything I know about him was secondhand except for about a week, and even then I don\u2019t remember much,\u201d Jeff Buckley said in a 1995 interview with The Times. \u201cGenetics be dammed. . . . I have completely different musical choices.\u201d\nIronically, Jeff\u2019s mother is the parent who will now be most often mentioned in articles involving the posthumous release of \u201cSketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk,\u201d a two-disc collection of her son\u2019s music. It\u2019s a captivating work that extends the enormous promise of Buckley\u2019s 1994 debut, \u201cGrace.\u201d (See accompanying review.)\nHaving his mother\u2019s name in stories would have made sense to Buckley. Guibert, her maiden name, put her acting dreams on hold to raise Jeff and his younger brother, and the two remained close throughout his life.\nIn the months after her son died in an accidental drowning in a Memphis marina last May, Guibert, 50, listened for hours to his unreleased tapes to select the tracks that would be included in the new set.\nOn the eve of the album\u2019s release Tuesday by Columbia Records, Guibert, who lives in Santa Ana, spoke about her son, his music and how she hopes he\u2019s remembered as a positive force.\n*\nQuestion: How did you feel when Jeff told you he was going into the music business? Given the way Tim\u2019s life ended, did you worry about what might happen to him?\nAnswer: From the time Jeff was an infant, I knew he was musically inclined. Even when he was in those little infant seats, he would vocalize with the music on the radio in a way that you could tell he was trying to follow the melody line. It was amazing.\n*\nQ: But did you feel any fear that he, too, might end up tragically?\nA: No, not that. The fear I had was the same fear Jeff had . . . that people wouldn\u2019t give him an opportunity to express his own music . . . that they would never be able to shake the comparisons with Tim Buckley.\n*\nQ: When did you start thinking he might actually be able to have a career . . . that he was truly talented?\nA: It sounds like a mother talking, but I really knew early on that his love of music was so profound that it was going to put him somewhere in that world. I hoped that he would become a good songwriter, someone whose work was often performed by other artists, which might be an easier life . . . rather than being a star.\nAnd, I think that\u2019s what he originally had in mind. I once said to him, \u201cWatch out, \u2018Grace\u2019 might get a Grammy nomination.\u201d And he said, \u201cNo, mom, that\u2019s not the kind of artist I am.\u201d He didn\u2019t see himself as a pop star. I think he even went out of his way to avoid that mold. Look how long it took him to make the second album. He didn\u2019t rush back into the studio after \u201cGrace\u201d--to cash in on its success.\nHe was thinking of a long career. He didn\u2019t want to be the flavor of the month. He wanted a stable life.\n*\nQ: That\u2019s interesting . . . the \u201cstable life\u201d part because it\u2019s easy to think of him, especially after his death, as a tortured artist. There was such a restless, soul-searching quality to his music. But that wasn\u2019t him?\nA: No, Jeff hated that [stereotype] of songwriters. He hated how this society seems to glorify negative issues. If artists are drugging themselves to death at an early age, then something is wrong with the psyche of those young artists. But that wasn\u2019t Jeff.\nJeff was a very positive person . . . very much a seeker of truth. He was into a Sufi way of thinking, that we do not need a [go-between] between us and God, and that love is the highest power.\n*\nQ: What about Tim? Was he more troubled?\nA: It may sound strange, but I only knew Tim so briefly. It would be unfair to make any comparison. I was only married to Tim about a year and two months. Jeff was born after the marriage broke up. I was 5 1/2 months pregnant when I filed for divorce. . . . My biggest regret in life was that Tim couldn\u2019t have lived and they could have had a relationship. I\u2019m sure Tim would have been so proud of him.\n*\nQ: Why did you agree to put the album together? It must have been hard to listen to his voice for all those hours.\nA: I knew I wanted to be the one to sort of monitor what was going to happen to his music, though I had no way of envisioning how difficult it would be. There were tapes from the different sessions . . . the early ones in Chicago with Tom Verlaine producing, which Jeff was not happy with, and the four-track demos. . . .\nAt the moment that Jeff walked into the water [before he drowned], he was ready to finally go in and make the second album. He knew exactly what he wanted. He and I had a long conversation just previous to that. We talked about everything about his life. We even covered some stuff that we needed to clean house on as a mother and a son.\n*\nQ: What has it been like now that you\u2019ve \u201csurfaced\u201d in Jeff\u2019s life. Do you hear from his fans? What do they say?\nA: His fans are some of the neatest people. They came from all over the world on their own money to the memorial in New York. Some slept on borrowed floors and bus benches. They wrote some of the most beautiful poetry. I\u2019ve received CDs and cassettes from musicians all over the world who were inspired by Jeff.\nThey always want to say how Jeff touched their lives. A lot of them mention that they had lost loved ones and \u201cGrace\u201d helped them heal. That\u2019s the most beautiful thought to me because it\u2019s exactly what Jeff wanted with his music. He wanted to touch and inspire people. That was his dream."
