  "title": "Here's Why Your iPhone Battery Drains Overnight (and How to Stop It)",
  "description": "Stop the drain and wake up to a phone that\u2019s ready for the day.",
  "content": "If you\u2019ve ever woken up to find your iPhone battery mysteriously down to 20% or less, you\u2019re not alone. After some trial and error, I discovered the most common culprits\u2014and how to fix them.\n\nWhile software bugs or outdated iOS versions are more likely to cause battery drain during the day when you\u2019re actively using your phone, they can occasionally impact your battery overnight too. Some background processes may malfunction or fail to enter sleep mode correctly, keeping system services or apps running even when the phone should be idle.\n\nThis kind of drain often happens when a buggy app is stuck syncing data, or if specific iOS processes aren\u2019t behaving as expected. If your iPhone battery was holding up nicely overnight and the issue began suddenly after a recent iOS update, a software bug could be the culprit. Alternatively, tasks like reindexing files or refreshing app data can temporarily increase power usage and even make your phone sluggish after an update.\n\nHowever, this post-update battery drain usually resolves on its own within a day or two. If it persists, it may point to a deeper software glitch. In that case, you can restart your iPhone. If that doesn't help, updating your iPhone may help fix the issue, because Apple might have squashed the bug in the latest iOS version. Software updates are essential, so always keep your iPhone up to date.\n\nOn iOS, certain apps continue running in the background even after you stop using them, and quietly eat away at your iPhone\u2019s battery even if you're not using the device. Examples include social media, messaging, and location-based apps, as they often refresh content or sync data while your phone is idle. Such activity may not seem like much on its own, but across multiple apps, the effect can be significant enough to drain your battery overnight.\n\nTo find out your iPhone's battery usage, go to Settings > Battery, then on the next page, scroll to see the list of apps and the amount of battery each one has used. If there's an app with unusually high background usage, turn off its background activity.\n\nYou can do this by heading to Settings > General > Background App Refresh, then toggling off the apps that don\u2019t need to stay updated constantly.\n\nThis will ensure that these apps only run when you're using them, not in the background at random times. Alternatively, if you're willing to take the extreme approach, you can disable Background App Refresh completely.\n\nEvery time your iPhone lights up for a notification\u2014whether it\u2019s a text, email, app alert, or even a calendar reminder\u2014it briefly wakes the device. It might not seem significant, but dozens of overnight notifications can quietly drain your battery.\n\nEach wake-up moment uses battery power, especially if your screen stays on for several seconds or if the notification triggers haptic feedback.\n\nTo minimize the drain, enable Focus Mode or Do Not Disturb during your sleep hours. Go to Settings > Focus > Sleep, and customize which apps or people are allowed to notify you.\n\nRemember, you can edit your iPhone's Focus settings at any time. You can also turn off alerts from non-essential apps by heading to Settings > Notifications.\n\nYour iPhone regularly syncs photos, videos, and app data with iCloud when connected to Wi-Fi and has sufficient battery. However, if your iPhone's battery health has significantly degraded, you may notice significant drops overnight, even if the phone has enough charge for syncing.\n\nThese processes can be particularly demanding if you\u2019ve taken lots of photos or videos during the day. And while they typically occur quietly in the background, they still use processing power and energy\u2014especially on aging devices.\n\nTo minimize this, enabling Low Power Mode before bed can help significantly. You can enable it by navigating to Settings > Battery and toggling on Low Power Mode.\n\nAlternatively, you can open the Control Center on your iPhone and do it from there. Low Power Mode temporarily disables or limits background activities like iCloud syncing and mail fetching, helping preserve the battery.\n\nLocation Services can also be a source of overnight battery drain. Many apps request location access not just while you're using them, but also in the background\u2014sometimes even when you're asleep.\n\nIf an app has permission to access your location, it can periodically wake your iPhone to check for location updates or run geofencing tasks. Over time, this background activity can add up and drain your battery, especially if several apps are doing it.\n\nTo check which apps are using your location, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services. Review each app\u2019s permissions and switch them to While Using the App or Never unless background access is essential.\n\nAlso, scroll down to System Services and disable any features you don\u2019t need. If you want to take it a step further, completely disable Location Services to give your battery a break during the night. Navigate to Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services, then toggle off Location Services.\n\nOvernight battery drain can be frustrating, but it\u2019s often fixable. By updating your iPhone, managing background activity, and tweaking key settings, you can stop the drain and wake up to a phone that\u2019s ready for the day.",

      "text": "Quick Links\nSummary\n- The Control Center on your iPhone lets you quickly access features like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, the flashlight, Do Not Disturb, and more.\n- You can customize the Control Center by adding, rearranging, or removing controls to suit your preferences.\n- It's a good idea to disable Control Center access on the Lock Screen to prevent others from making changes to your iPhone's settings.\nThe iOS Control Center offers a convenient way to quickly access various settings and features without needing to navigate through the Settings app or third-party apps. Here's everything you need to know about using and customizing your iPhone's Control Center.\nHow to Access Your iPhone's Control Center\nLet's start with the basics, i.e., opening the Control Center. The method varies slightly depending on your iPhone model:\n- On an iPhone with a Home button (like the iPhone SE, 8, and earlier), you need to swipe up from the bottom of the screen.\n- On an iPhone with Face ID (like the iPhone X and later), swipe down from the top-right corner of the screen.\nTo close the Control Center, long-press on an empty area. Depending on your iPhone model, you may also swipe up (models with Face ID) or down (models with a Home button) to exit.\nOpening the Control Center also displays handy icons at the top, such as the carrier name, rotation lock status, and battery percentage. With iOS 18, you also get an option to turn off your iPhone directly from the Control Center.\nWhat to Do if You Can't Access the Control Center\nIf, for some reason, you can't access the Control Center, try restarting your iPhone first. If that doesn't help, ensure that Control Center is enabled within apps and on the Lock Screen.\nFinally, if nothing else works, updating to the latest iOS version and resetting all settings by going to Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings should help.\nHow to Use the Control Center on Your iPhone\nFrom adjusting brightness and volume to controlling media playback and activating Do Not Disturb mode, the Control Center puts essential tools at your fingertips. Plus, using the Control Center is straightforward.\nIf your iPhone is running iOS 18, you can swipe between different Control Center pages by swiping up and down or tapping the icons on the right. You can tap, slide, or long-press the toggles to interact with them.\nFor example, you can swipe up or down on the brightness slider to adjust the brightness. Pressing and holding the brightness slider reveals icons for Dark Mode, Night Shift, and True Tone. Similarly, long-pressing the flashlight icon allows you to adjust its intensity.\nIf you tap and hold on the Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or AirDrop icons, you can select a different Wi-Fi network, choose another Bluetooth device, or change AirDrop visibility settings, respectively.\nHow to Edit the Control Center on an iPhone\nThe Control Center offers several handy options on your iPhone. You can add, rearrange, or remove controls to customize it according to your preferences.\nTo edit the Control Center on your iPhone, follow these steps:\n- Open the Control Center and tap the plus button (+) in the top-left corner. Alternatively, you can long-press anywhere on an empty spot to edit the Control Center.\n- Tap Add a Control and then scroll through the list to select the control you want to add.\n- Once added, you can drag the control anywhere to place it or move it to a different page. You can also resize the control to your liking.\n- To remove a control, tap the minus icon in its top-left corner.\n- Tap anywhere on an empty spot to save the changes.\nBy default, the Control Center shows only three pages, but you can add or remove pages as needed. To add a new page to the Control Center, tap and hold an empty spot to enter edit mode, then tap the circle icon on the right to access a blank page. Next, tap Add a Control and select a control to create a new page. To remove a Control Center page, simply remove all the controls from that page.\nHow to Disable Control Center Access on the Lock Screen\nBy default, anyone with access to your iPhone can access the Control Center from the Lock Screen. From there, they can put your device in Airplane Mode, turn off Wi-Fi, play music, use Home controls, and more.\nHowever, you can prevent this by disabling Control Center access on the Lock Screen. To do this:\n- Open Settings, then scroll down and tap Face ID & Passcode or Touch ID & Passcode.\n- Enter your iPhone passcode to continue.\n- Under Allow Access When Locked, turn off the toggle next to Control Center.\nHow to Turn Off Control Center Access Within Apps\nIf you play iPhone games that involve vigorous swiping, or if your kids use the device to learn and play, you may want to disable Control Center access within apps to prevent accidentally opening it. Here's how to do that:\n- Open the Settings app on your iPhone.\n- Scroll down and tap Control Center.\n- Turn off Access Within Apps.\nAfter this, you'll need to head to your iPhone's Home Screen or Lock Screen to access the Control Center.\nUseful Control Center Tips to Maximize Your Experience\nNow that you are familiar with how to access, edit, and disable the Control Center on your iPhone, here are some useful tips to help you make the most of it:\n- With iOS 18, the Control Center now supports toggles for various third-party apps, so you'll see options from apps like ChatGPT, Instagram, Snapchat, and more.\n- You can add a Notes icon to the Control Center, allowing you to quickly jot down text from your iPhone's Lock Screen.\n- If you wish to record your gameplay, create tutorials, or similar activities, you can add the Screen Recording shortcut to the Control Center.\n- Adding the Shazam icon to the Control Center lets you recognize songs on your iPhone without having to summon Siri.\n- If you have an Apple TV, adding the Apple TV Remote to the Control Center provides you with a virtual remote to control your Apple TV.\n- You can also add a shortcut for any app to launch it quickly from the Control Center.\nThe Control Center on your iPhone is extremely useful for accessing essential features and settings. By taking advantage of the iOS Control Center, you can avoid heading to the Settings app or opening third-party apps to access the features you use frequently."

      "text": "Do Not Disturb is now categorized under Focus, and it's a valuable tool you can use to stop distractions as you go about your business. It stops calls, notifications, and other prompts that typically pop up on your Apple devices.\nHowever, there are various Focus presets, and Do Not Disturb is just one of them. You can learn to edit your Focus presets so that they are more optimized for what you need them for. We've detailed the steps for how to do it on your iPhone.\nHow to Edit Focus Settings on Your iPhone\nApple's Focus feature has preset modes you can set up, but you can also create custom modes if needed. However, if you're ever dissatisfied with how Do Not Disturb or other Focus modes work, you should head to Settings > Focus and tap the preset you want to change.\nTo make things simpler, we've divided the settings menu into different sections so you can better understand what each of them does.\nAllow Notifications\nAs pointed out in the description, Allow Notifications will let certain contacts and apps ignore Focus and notify you. And there are three options here: People, Apps, and Options.\nPeople has two modes: Silence Notifications From and Allow Notifications From. The first silences notifications from the people you add to the list below (it's inefficient unless you're being very specific on the people you don't want to reach you). The second one is the default, and it lets you choose who can reach you instead.\nThe next section in People, called Phone Calls, is designed so you can also choose to allow calls from some people.\n- Allowed People Only lets you receive calls from people you've allowed notifications from.\n- Favorites lets people on your iPhone's favorite list call you while in Focus.\n- Contacts Only stops all calls from unsaved numbers.\n- Everybody lets everyone reach you.\nYou can also create custom contact lists which will appear in the Allow Call From dropdown menu.\nThe last setting here is Allow Repeated Calls, which, if toggled on, would let calls from people who call you twice within three minutes.\nApps mirrors People in that it lets you choose to either Silence Notifications From or Allow Notifications From the apps you add to the list below. However, instead of \"Allow Repeated Calls,\" it has a Time-Sensitive Notification toggle, which, if toggled, would allow apps with notifications marked Time Sensitive to notify you even while in Focus.\nThe last part of Allow Notifications is Options (or Notification Options). It has three toggles:\n- Show On Lock Screen will display all the silenced notifications on the Lock Screen instead of sending them to the Notification Center to peruse later.\n- Dim Lock Screen simply darkens the Lock Screen while this Focus is on. It's a good way to remind yourself your phone is in Focus.\n- Hide Notification Badges hide those little red circles appearing on your apps. They tell you how many unread notifications you have on that app.\nYou can learn more about badges, banners, and alerts to make the most of your iPhone notifications.\nCustomize Screens\nIf you'd like something cosmetic to help you avoid distractions, Focus allows you to have a different Home Screen and Lock Screen for the duration of Focus.\nThere are two images in this section; the one on the left (with the time) is the Lock Screen, and the other is the Home Screen.\nHere's how to change your Lock Screen and Home Screen background image:\n- Tap Choose below the Lock Screen page and create a new Lock Screen by tapping Pick a Lock Screen from the Gallery.\n- Choose something from all the different categories.\n- Select Add on the top right of the sample view.\n- Tap Set as Wallpaper Pair if you want your Lock Screen as your Home Screen as well.\n- You can also select Customize Home Screen to choose more specific details on what you want your Home Screen to look like.\n- Tap Done on the top right when you're finished.\nSurprisingly, selecting Choose under the Home Screen doesn't let you change your Home Screen wallpaper. Instead, it makes you select what page(s) you would like on your Home Screen as a way to limit distractions. So, you can pile up all the apps you need to work on one page and turn off all the rest.\nSet a Schedule\nYou can automatically trigger Focus by using a schedule. You can set it up based on time, location, or an app.\nHere's how to create a schedule:\n- Tap Add Schedule.\n- You have four options: Time, Location, App, and Smart Activation.\n- Smart Activation will learn from your app usage, locations, and other factors to automatically turn your Focus on. Tap the plus (+) sign on Smart Activation to create a Smart Activation schedule.\n- If you want to use another schedule, tap Time, Location, or App instead. But remember, you can have multiple schedules for one Focus; you don't need to worry that choosing one will exclude the other.\n- Tap Time to set up the hours and days of the week you want your Focus on. Tap Done when you're finished.\n- Tap Location, search for a place, and use the slider at the bottom to reduce or increase the area of effect. Tap Done when you're finished.\n- Tap App to choose from a list of apps.\nCombine schedules as you please to create a more wholesome automated Focus experience.\nFocus Filters\nFocus filters add another layer of distraction avoidance to your Focus mode by removing elements of certain apps while in Focus.\nScroll down to the last segment of your Focus settings and tap Add Filter. A list of the available filters will appear. This list falls into App Filters and System Filters.\nApp Filters vary depending on what apps you have installed. For example, if you Messages, you'll have the option to filter conversations in Messages so you only see conversations from contacts you have added to your Focus.\nSystem Filters, on the other hand, are system settings you can automatically enable by turning on the Focus. For instance, you can enable Low Power Mode if you would like it to turn on once you enter a particular Focus mode.\nSelect the filters you want to use and tap Add at the top-right corner.\nApple's Focus Feature Has Come a Long Way\nComing from the lowly days when Focus was just Do Not Disturb, it has grown a lot to become a powerful tool for productivity. It's also a great way to combat phone addiction or avoid constant notifications from social media.\nMix and match these Focus settings till you find one that isn't too excessive or too light, and you will enjoy peace of mind while working or spending time with your loved ones."

      "text": "Quick Links\nSummary\n- Back up your iPhone before updating to avoid data loss if something goes wrong. You can back up via iCloud or your computer.\n- Ensure you have enough free space on your iPhone for the update to work properly.\n- Most people update their iPhone through Settings, but you can also update via iTunes/Finder on your computer if you prefer.\nLike most tasks on an iPhone, keeping your device up to date is pretty simple. We'll explain how to update your iPhone, plus what to know when it's time to install the latest iOS version.\nWhile we focus on iPhone here, most of this advice works the same for iPad and iPadOS.\nBefore You Update: Back Up Your iPhone and Check Free Space\nPrior to installing any iPhone system update, you should have a current backup. This ensures that if the process goes wrong, you don't have to set up your device from scratch.\nSee our full guide to backing up your iPhone for everything you need to know. There are two methods: via iCloud or your computer. Neither is perfect, but they are both easy to perform and allow you to protect your data before updating.\nIt's also important to make sure your iPhone storage has some breathing room before you run the update. iOS updates won't work if you're critically low on space.\nHead to Settings > General > iPhone Storage to make sure you have at least a few gigabytes free. See our guide to freeing up space on your iPhone if you need to clear a large amount of storage.\nHow to Update iOS on Your iPhone\nThe easiest and most common way to update your iPhone is on the device itself. Before you start, your iPhone needs to be connected to Wi-Fi. Also, your device's battery level must be over 50%, since your phone running out of power during an update can cause serious problems. It's always a good idea to plug your iPhone in before you start an update to avoid this.\nTo update, open the Settings app and select General > Software Update. You'll see the details of the update, if one is available, on the next screen.\nIf you're not running the latest major version of iOS yet, you may see the option to apply any available updates for your current iOS version, in addition to installing the latest major version. While we recommend updating when a new iOS version is available, this option gives you more control if you need to stay on your current version a bit longer.\nIf your phone has not automatically downloaded the update already, tap Download and Install. This shows Install Now instead if it's already downloaded. Once it's ready, a dialog will appear asking you to confirm by tapping Install once more\u2014you can also choose to run the update later (usually overnight) if you prefer. You'll need to enter your passcode to confirm the update.\nShould you keep getting errors about verifying the update, you may need to re-download it. You can remove iOS update data by going back to General in the Settings app. Tap iPhone Storage, then find the iOS update in the list. Select it and choose Delete Update, then try to re-download it.\nWhile you're here, it's also worth tapping Automatic Updates and making sure your phone is set to automatically download and install updates in the future\u2014including critical Rapid Response updates.\nHow to Update Your iPhone Using Your Computer\nWhile it's not a common method these days, you can still install an iPhone update via iTunes or Finder on your computer. Updating this way can also be handy if you don't have a reliable Wi-Fi signal but do have a computer with an Ethernet connection.\nYou might also prefer to do this if your phone is low on storage; since the update files are downloaded to your computer, your iPhone doesn't need as much free space for the process.\nTo begin, connect your phone to your computer using the appropriate cable. Once you do:\n- On Windows, open iTunes and click the Device icon that appears at the top-left. Make sure you're on the Summary tab.\n- On a Mac, open Finder and click your iPhone's name on the left sidebar. Make sure you're on the General tab.\nIn the top box, click Check for Update (or Update if one is already prepared). A popup will notify you of the new version; click Download and Install. You'll need to enter your passcode before applying the update. Keep your iPhone connected to your computer until the process completes.\nRestarting and Fixing iPhone Update Issues\nRegardless of the method you use, your iPhone has to restart (it may be multiple times) to apply the update. This screen shows an Apple logo with a progress bar. After it finishes, your phone should reboot to your Lock Screen as normal. Once you unlock it, you might need to tap through some menus to agree to any licensing changes and re-enter iCloud info.\nIf your phone hangs at the Apple logo, you may need to restore it. Try pressing a button on your phone; you should see a message if the update is still working. If it's unresponsive for some time (more than an hour or so), try force-restarting your iPhone. Only do this if you're sure that the update is frozen, as forcing your iPhone to shut down while it's installing an update can cause major issues.\nAfter that, reboot your phone. If you get a screen with a computer icon and a USB cable, you'll need to restore your device. Connect it to iTunes/Finder again and click Restore iPhone on the same screen where you updated your phone. Sometimes the update will continue from where you left off and complete as normal after a forced restart.\nSee our guide to troubleshooting iPhone update problems if you have further issues.\nNow you know how to keep your iPhone current with the latest system software. After updating iOS on your iPhone, why not take a moment to update all your iPhone apps too?"

      "text": "Quick Links\nSluggish phone performance can be frustrating, but this could be your reality after a software update. Let's explain why this happens and how to make your phone feel snappier again.\nWhy Your Phone Slows Down After an Update\nIf it's been a while since you bought your phone, it might feel sluggish after installing a software update. Switching between apps suddenly takes a little longer, and your device doesn't feel as snappy performing basic everyday tasks as it used to while still brand new, like taking pictures of your pet.\nIf you're experiencing this, it could be due to various factors. One of the most common culprits is the act of planned obsolescence, where companies slow the device's performance to nudge users to upgrade. For example, according to the BBC, Apple was fined $500 million in the US after being found guilty of deliberately slowing down select models of old iPhones.\nOther factors that can cause sluggish performance after a software update include increased resource usage, app compatibility issues, and battery and performance management changes.\nIncreased Resource Usage\nWe always recommend updating your device by installing software updates once available. Updates patch existing bugs and vulnerabilities, which is why software updates keep you safe. They also enhance the experience by adding new features.\nHowever, these additional improvements and features with new software can sometimes be detrimental to devices, especially older ones, because of increased resource usage. Because of increased resource demands, your device feels slower after updating.\nApp Compatibility Issues\nSoftware updates ship with changes to the operating system. So, when a major software update is released, app developers must optimize their apps to be fully compatible with the new version. However, app developers may take time to optimize their apps for the latest OS version.\nIn most cases, many apps may run without issues on newer OS versions. Yet, they won't be as efficient, increasing resource usage and slowing down your device.\nBattery and Performance Management Changes\nSoftware updates can include changes in how your phone manages its battery and performance for better efficiency. But, these changes can negatively affect your phone's performance. For instance, an update can throttle the CPU and GPU performance on older devices to improve battery life since batteries weaken over time.\nFor example, an Apple support article says that its performance management algorithms can sometimes take extreme measures to prevent unexpected shutdowns by limiting peak performance. This could cause longer app launch times, fewer frame rates while scrolling the device and in some apps, and limited background refresh in apps that require it.\nHow to Fix Your Phone's Performance After a Software Update\nSluggish performance is just one of the warning signs that you need to upgrade your phone. But don't be too quick to do that yet. Before splurging on a shiny new powerful phone, go through these five fixes to help address the issue:\nUpdate Your Apps\nRunning outdated apps after installing new software can slow down your device. The first step after updating your phone to a new software version is to update your apps. If there's an update for any app you have installed, install it because it could include optimizations to improve app performance.\nYou can check for updates in Apple's App Store by tapping your profile icon at the top right and scrolling down to Upcoming Automatic Updates. Tap Update All to update all the apps.\nFor Android, tap your profile icon in the top right corner, select Manage apps & device, and tap Update all next to Updates available.\nDisable or Uninstall Unused Apps\nThe second measure, especially if you hoard apps, is to uninstall or disable any that you don't need. Unused apps can consume system resources, including storage and CPU resources, leading to sluggish performance. This is especially true for old apps that aren't optimized for the new OS version.\nThere are different ways to remove unwanted apps on Android. If you encounter any that can't be uninstalled, disable them. You can also uninstall unwanted apps on your iPhone from various places.\nFree Up Storage Space\nWith limited free storage space on your device, your phone is bound to be sluggish even without updating software. However, since software updates can increase the resources the OS requires, the device can feel sluggish immediately after an update. With insufficient free storage on your phone, system processes will slow, leading to sluggish performance.\nThe easy fix is to free up storage on your phone by deleting unnecessary files, such as old downloads, duplicate media files, and offline content you downloaded from your favorite apps like Netflix, YouTube, or Spotify. Uninstalling apps you don't need can also help free up storage.\nClear Cache\nAs you continue to use your phone, it adds frequently used resources to its cache storage for fast access, thus resulting in better performance. However, cached data can be outdated or corrupted after a system update, resulting in lags, crashes, and unexpected behavior. Clearing the cache will help remove corrupt or obsolete files, free up space, improve performance, and even fix any glitches and bugs you may experience.\nSince Apple doesn't provide a way to clear cache on iOS, you can uninstall and reinstall an app to remove its cached data. For Android, you can clear cache per app by navigating to Settings > Apps > See all apps, selecting any app, tapping Storage & cache, and choosing Clear cache.\nPerform a Factory Reset\nIf everything else doesn't improve performance, you should perform a factory reset as a last resort. This will clear all the data and apps from your device, allowing you to start fresh, just like when you bought it.\nFactory resetting your phone will delete all data. Before doing so, ensure that you back up important data.\nYou can factory reset your Android phone or iPhone in different ways. Once you do so, your device should perform better.\nA software update can be detrimental to your phone's performance. But by leveraging the fixes provided, you can get your phone running snappier again."

      "text": "When you get a software update notification, putting it off is natural. After all, updates can be time-consuming and often leave you without access to your device during the process. But if you value your safety, you should consider updating your device software. So what do software updates actually do? Why are they important for your security?\nWhat Do Software Updates Do?\nNew apps, protocols, and features are being developed every day, so your software can't stay the same forever. If you never update your device software, it's likely that you'll run into problems down the line.\nA software update can be highly transformative or minor, depending on what developers have released. An update may contain a simple patch or two, but can also change your device's interface and capabilities noticeably.\nNot all software updates are the same, but they often bring one or more of the following:\n- Bug and vulnerability patches.\n- New features.\n- Speed and efficiency improvements.\n- App compatibility.\nThe first of this list is what we'll be focusing on here, as it's bug and vulnerability patches that can improve your device's security overall.\nHow Software Updates Protect You\nA lot of software programs are long and complex, including gaming, social media, and entertainment apps.\nAccording to Softonic, the number of code lines in popular programs is as follows:\n- iOS: 12 million lines.\n- Android: 12 million lines.\n- Windows 10: 80 million lines.\n- Facebook: 62 million lines.\n- Instagram: one million lines.\n- Adobe Photoshop: 10 million lines.\n- Minecraft: 500,000 lines.\nEvidently, there's a lot of work that goes into developing a software program. And, within these thousands or millions of lines of code, it's normal for there to be a few mistakes.\nIf these mistakes cause huge issues, like immediate crashes, interface issues, or another noticeable flaw, they're often ironed out before the program is released. But some code flaws are more discrete and minor, which makes them harder for developers to notice.\nThis is what results in released programs having bugs and vulnerabilities. A bug can be completely harmless in nature, whereas a vulnerability is something that can be exploited.\nFor instance, a bug in the Instagram app may prevent you from liking posts, which is frustrating, but not dangerous. On the other hand, a vulnerability in the Instagram app may stop you from being able to block a user, make your profile private, or use two-factor authentication. It's here that things get risky.\nCybercriminals often scan for software vulnerabilities when trying to attack a program. Some vulnerabilities aren't very useful, while others can give an attacker access to swathes of private information.\nSome software vulnerabilities have caused huge problems in the past, such as the Log4Shell flaw. Log4Shell is a Java-based code vulnerability that allows remote code execution in Apache Log4j 2, a logging utility. Remote code execution allows an attacker to deploy malware on a device remotely, making hacks that much easier.\nSome big programs, including Minecraft, use this utility, with servers and clients becoming vulnerable to attacks. Minecraft users were urged to update their software to patch this vulnerability, a fix that we'll discuss soon.\nVulnerabilities will either be noticed by a program's creators, maintenance team, or by average users. Open-sourced software programs can be vetted by anyone, making it easier to pick up on issues. Closed source programs, on the other hand, may rely on visible flaws that cause noticeable issues for users to spot a problem, as their code cannot be publicly vetted.\nOnce the software team is notified of a vulnerability, they'll usually work to patch it quickly. When a vulnerability is patched, the coding flaw is fixed, and so can no longer be exploited.\nWhy Updates Matter\nPatches come hand-in-hand with software updates and can mean the difference between avoiding and falling victim to an exploit. If you've been notified that an app of yours has a vulnerability, and there's a patch available in an update, it's best to initiate this update as soon as possible.\nEven if there isn't a known vulnerability in your current software version, software updates can get rid of bugs, boost your device's compatibility with other programs, and even give you access to new features.\nThe Downsides of Software Updates\nSoftware updates can offer a lot of benefits, but it's important to discuss the possible downsides you may run into when giving your apps and OS a refresh.\nFirstly, software updates can bring further bugs or vulnerabilities. It's a bit of a catch-22, right? Updates can patch pre-existing flaws, but run the risk of bringing new issues within the updated code.\nTake iOS updates, for example. Many iPhone users steered clear of the iOS 15 update in 2021, as there were a slew of reported problems. Battery drainage, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth issues, and TouchID problems were all reported by users who installed the iOS 15 update.\niOS 16 also came with some disappointments, including UI lag, spontaneous rebooting, and problems with Safari.\nThe case is often similar with Android OS updates. Android 13 brought some great features, but users also reported worse performance, system crashes, and limited customization features upon installing the update. The previous Android 12 update came with its own set of issues, including idle battery drainage, difficulty answering calls, and media freezes.\nThese issues don't make new OS versions inherently bad, but it's worth noting that updates are rarely perfect. There are pros and cons that come with almost every update, but it's always best to keep your software up-to-date to avoid falling victim to unexpected exploits.\nShould You Update Your Device?\nIn short, yes. You shouldn't put off software updates to avoid the chance of further flaws.\nHowever, if a new update does come out and your device is requesting to download it, run a quick browser search to see how other users are finding it after installation. If you see that there are a lot more cons than pros, you may want to wait until the developers release an amended version.\nSoftware Updates Are There For a Reason\nWhile you may be tempted to ignore software updates to save time, this can leave your OS and apps open to security exploits. To avoid being targeted by cyberattacks via vulnerabilities, it's worth updating your software on a fairly regular basis."
