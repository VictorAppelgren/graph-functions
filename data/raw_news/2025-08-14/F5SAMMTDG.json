  "content": "Cadbury has sparked fury among shoppers after cutting the number of Brunch bars in a pack just less than a year after a previous bout of shrinkflation by the brand.\n\nMultipacks of five oat, raisin and chocolate treats now only have four in the boxes - but are still being flogged for the same average price of \u00a31.50.\n\nIt means the breakfast bars are essentially 20 per cent worse value.\n\nThe controversial move comes 11 months after the weight of a bar was reduced from 32g to 28g.\n\nConsumers took to social media to rage about the new adjustment.\n\nOne said: 'Cadbury chocolates are shrinking in size & quality is dropping \u2014 paying more for less is not sweet at all.'\n\nA second said: 'So you redesign the box of your Cadbury Brunch Bournville Dark Chocolate Cereal Bars and make it all bright and snazzy, but you then shrink the number of bars per box from 5 to 4 and think it's ok to charge the same price for it? Highway robbery!!!'\n\nAnother said: 'Almost like companies intentionally do that so people have to buy two boxes at a time for their child to get one every day in their lunchbox.'\n\nA fourth fumed: 'These companies like to be sneaky and reduce package sizes and change ingredients behind our backs.'\n\nCadbury owner Mondelez has been contacted for comment.\n\nIt previously said it was 'continuing to experience significantly higher input costs' across its supply chain, according to The Sun.\n\nCury Wurly bars have become one of the latest victims of shrinkflation as multipacks have shrunk from five to four - but the price has remained the same.\n\nThe shrunk packs of the Cadbury's bar are being sold for \u00a31.40, even though the bigger size cost the same only a few months ago.\n\nThe change has been blasted by sweet-toothed shoppers online, causing some to vow to never buy the chocolate again due to the sneaky corporate tactic.\n\nPacks of Fudge and Freddo have previously gone down from five to four bars, and Dairy Milk Little Bars are reduced from six to four.\n\nMeanwhile, bags of Crunchie Rocks, Bitsa Wispa and Oreo Bites have all shrunk from 110g to 100g. However, they are still being sold at major retailers for the same price - \u00a31.75.\n\nAs well as Cadbury, other notable confectionary brands such as Nestle's KitKat and Terry's Chocolate Orange have suffered from shrinkflation.",

  "summary": "Cadbury has caused controversy by reducing the number of its Brunch bars in a pack, just over a year after a previous bout of shrinkflation. Multipacks of five oat, raisin and chocolate treats now only have four in the boxes, while they are being sold for the same price of \u00a31.50. This makes the breakfast bars 20 per cent worse value. The move has been met with criticism on social media, with some believing it's 'highway robbery' for the company. Other notable brands such as Nestle's KitKat and Terry's Chocolate Orange have also experienced shrinkflation, with other notable brands including Fudge and Freddo previously reducing their sizes.",
