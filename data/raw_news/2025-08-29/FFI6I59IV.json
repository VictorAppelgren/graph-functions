  "content": "A box truck driver who had no license plate was arrested in the hit-and-run death of an off-duty NYPD cop riding his motorcycle home from work, cops said.\n\nCarlos Almanzar Toribio, 30, was arrested hours after the fiery crash that threw the cop from his bike on the westbound Brooklyn-Queens Expressway near Atlantic around 8:30 a.m., authorities said.\n\nDetectives reviewed video from the scene that helped them identify the box truck, and Toribio was cuffed around 7:30 p.m., police said.\n\nThe Washington Heights resident, who has no prior arrests, was charged with leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death, operating an unregistered vehicle and driving without a license plate, police said.\n\nThe 30-year-old officer \u2013 assigned to the midnight tour at the 84th Precinct in downtown Brooklyn \u2013 was riding a Yamaha R1 motorcycle on the westbound expressway when he was struck around 8:30 a.m. near Exit 27, authorities and sources said.\n\nFootage obtained by the Post shows the cyclist in the moments before the crash, whizzing along the expressway in the outermost lanes in the direction of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge.\n\nThe box truck driver fled the scene, and it\u2019s possible he may not have even known he\u2019d hit someone, the sources said at the time.\n\nFootage posted on X by Williamsburg News shows the cop lying lifeless on the road as his motorcycle went up in flames feet away.\n\nThe officer \u2013 who had not officially been identified by the department by Thursday \u2013 was taken to NYU Langone Brooklyn Hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries.\n\nHis name was not officially released pending family notification.

      "text": "Former Yankees World Series winner Mark Teixeira announces run for Congress in Texas\nFormer New York Yankees first baseman Mark Teixeira, who played a pivotal role in the franchise\u2019s most recent World Series win, announced Thursday he will run for Congress from his home state of Texas.\n\u201cAs a lifelong conservative who loves this country, I\u2019m running for Congress to fight for the principles that make Texas and America great,\u201d Teixeira, who also played for the Atlanta Braves, Texas Rangers and Los Angeles Angels in a 14-year big league career, said on X while announcing his run.\n\u201cIt takes teamwork to win \u2013 I\u2019m ready to help defend President Trump\u2019s America First agenda, Texas families, and individual liberty.\u201d\nTeixeira, 45, will run to represent the Lone Star State\u2019s 21st District, located in the Texas Hill Country north of San Antonio and west of Austin.\nThe seat is currently held by GOP Rep. Chip Roy, who announced last week he would run for Texas attorney general in 2026 to replace current office-holder Ken Paxton rather than seek a fifth term in Washington.\nIn his campaign announcement, Teixeira vowed to \u201cwork with President Trump to secure the border, grow the economy, end radical woke indoctrination, promote American energy independence, defend life and the Second Amendment, end forever wars, and strengthen the military.\u201d\n\u201cPlaying for the Texas Rangers and raising my family in the Lone Star State has been one of the greatest blessings of my life,\u201d he added. \u201cNow, I\u2019m ready to answer the call to serve my country, my state, and the conservative principles that have made Texas the envy of the nation.\u201d\nA Maryland native, Teixeira spurned his local Baltimore Orioles and Washington Nationals, as well as the rival Boston Red Sox, to sign an eight-year, $180 million free agent contract with the Bombers in December 2008.\nThe following year, Teixeira hit 39 home runs and racked up 122 RBIs, finishing second in the voting for American League MVP as the Yankees won their 27th crown, defeating the Philadelphia Phillies four games to two in that year\u2019s World Series.\nDuring his time in the Bronx, Teixeira won three Gold Gloves for his work at first base and made the American League All-Star team twice. He also won the Silver Slugger Award in 2009 for his prowess with the bat that season.\nThe 5th overall pick in the 2001 MLB draft by the Rangers out of Georgia Tech, Teixeira retired following the 2016 season, his last with the Yanks. He and his family moved back to Texas in 2021.\nTeixeira was not known to be openly political during his playing career.\nHowever, in November 2015, Politico reported that he was part of the hosting committee for a fundraising event to benefit then-GOP presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), now secretary of state.\nTeixeira is the first candidate to declare for the 21st District seat, with Bexar County Republican Party vice chair Kyle Sinclair and San Antonio City Councilor Marc Whyte also expressing interest in running.\nLast week, Texas Republican legislators approved a revised map of the state\u2019s congressional districts, with analysts projecting it could net the GOP up to five additional House seats following next year\u2019s midterms."

      "text": "Minneapolis school shooter ID\u2019d as trans woman Robin Westman \u2014 as apparent manifesto included \u2018kill Trump\u2019\nThe deranged gunman who slaughtered two children and injured at least 17 others at a Catholic school in Minneapolis has been identified as a transgender woman \u2014 as disturbing videos posted by the shooter show a handwritten manifesto and \u201ckill Donald Trump\u201d and \u201cfor the children\u201d scrawled on gun magazines.\nRobin Westman, formerly Robert Westman, opened fire through the stained glass windows of a church at the Annunciation Catholic School \u2014 where he attended \u2014 during a celebratory back-to-school Mass filled with children around 8:30 a.m. Wednesday.\nJust hours before the cowardly massacre, Westman, 23, posted a series of twisted videos on YouTube, which included a manifesto, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara confirmed at a press conference.\nIn one 20-minute video, Westman flips through the disturbing handwritten manifesto. Much of it is written in a homespun code that uses Cyrillic characters and English phonetic words.\nIn the deranged writings, he gleefully fantasizes about \u201cbeing that scary horrible monster standing over those powerless kids\u201d and reverently confesses admiration for the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre.\nWestman applied to change his birth name from Robert to Robin in Dakota County, Minn., when he was 17 years old, according to court documents. That name change was granted in January 2020.\nThe petition added that Westman \u201cidentifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification.\u201d\nBut, five years later, he seemed to have backed away from that identity.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to dress girly all the time but I guess sometimes I really like it. I know I am not a woman but I definitely don\u2019t feel like a man,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cI really like my outfit. I look pretty, smart, and modest. I think I want to wear something like this for my shooting.\u201d\nHe also goes into great detail about his decision to target Annunciation, where he graduated from grade school in 2017, according to a yearbook obtained by CNN.\nHis mother, Mary Grace Westman, also worked as a secretary at the school until retiring in 2021, according to a Facebook post by the church.\n\u201cI am feeling good about Annunciation. It seems like a good combo of easy attack form and devastating tragedy and I want to do more research. I have concerns about finding a large enough group. I want to avoid any parents, but pre and post school drop off,\u201d another page reads.\n\u201cMaybe I could attack an event at the on-site church,\u201d he ominously scribbled. \u201cI think attacking a large group of kids coming in from recess is my best plan \u2026 Then from there I can go inside and kill, going for as long as I can.\u201d\nNear the end of the video, Westman flicks through a number of blank pages before reaching what appears to be a drawing showing the inside of a church, saying \u201cHaha, nice\u201d as he stops turning pages.\nHe then takes out a knife and stabs into the center of the sketch, his hand momentarily quivering before he withdraws the blade, and quietly mumbles, \u201ckill myself.\u201d\nIn a video titled \u201cSo long and thanks for all the fish,\u201d Westman slowly turns the pages of the red notebook, which is laid out on top of what appears to be schematic gun diagrams, one of them reading Ruger Mark IV \u2014 a type of small-caliber pistol.\nAs he flips the pages, an occasional plume of smoke is seen from the bottom of the screen, punctuated by coughs, disjointed cursing, and maniacal giggles.\nEach page is filled with inscrutable handwritten doggerel, which includes violent ramblings such as \u201cI have had thoughts about mass murder for a long time. I am very conflicted with writing this journal,\u201d the text, translated by The Post, reads in part.\n\u201cI need to get my thoughts out without getting on a watchlist haha!\u201d\nThe journal contains a number of other subtle clues about Weston\u2019s identity \u2014 hinting at an angry melange of far-left politics and antisemitism.\nHere is the latest on the mass shooting at a Minneapolis Catholic school:\n- Follow live updates on the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting\n- Minneapolis school shooter Robin Westman confessed he was \u2018tired of being trans\u2019: \u2018I wish I never brain-washed myself\u2019\n- First surviving victim in Minneapolis school shooting ID\u2019d\n- Melania Trump \u2018shattered\u2019 to \u2018senseless and depraved\u2019 Minnesota school shooting, calls for \u2018pre-emptive intervention\u2019\nOne page includes a trans pride flag sticker with \u201cDefend equality\u201d printed across the bottom, with a black AK-47 sticker laid on top.\nIn another entry, he writes, \u201cIf I carry out a racially motivated attack, it would be most likely against filthy Zionist jews,\u201d before calling Jewish people \u201centitled\u201d and \u201cpenny-sniffing\u201d before adding \u201cFREE PALESTINE!\u201d\n\u201cI hate fascism,\u201d read yet another page, following it up shortly after with \u201cI also love when kids get shot, I love to see kids get torn apart.\u201d\nHe later bemoaned the media, saying he is \u201ctired of the news headlines.\u201d\n\u201cThey only talk about brown people dying, and I don\u2019t care about them. I like to hear when Israelis get killed, but they don\u2019t like to report on that stuff,\u201d he wrote.\nThe demented manifesto sheds light on what appears to be a truly disturbed mind, with Weston musing about a grand \u201cfinal act\u201d \u2014 stating a desire to take out \u201ca target of political or societal significance\u201d before he died.\n\u201cTargets like [Elon] Musk, Trump or some significant exec.\u201d\nBut, he also claimed he had no political motive.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to [do] it to spread a message. I do it to please myself. I do it because I am sick,\u201d he wrote.\nHe also indicated that he knew the Annunciation shooting would culminate in his death and complained about apparent health issues.\n\u201cI think I might have some prostate problems. I have to piss so frequently and I\u2019m sick of it. Even if I can heal, I still just want to die and kill many people,\u201d the journal read.\nThe unhinged shooter went on to express sincere admiration for mass shooters \u2014 including Sandy Hook killer Adam Lanza.\n\u201cI have a deep fascination with one man in particular: Adam Lanza,\u201d he wrote in the journal on May 23 in reference to the 20-year-old perpetrator of the worst elementary school shooting in US history, which left 20 first-grade students and six adults dead.\n\u201cSandy Hook was my favorite, I think, exposure of school shootings.\u201d\nAnother video posted to YouTube in the hours before the sickening slaughter showed off a cache of weapons \u2014 including a semi-automatic rifle and a shotgun.\nGun magazines were scrawled with \u201cfor the children\u201d and \u201ckill Donald Trump.\u201d\nWestman, who died at the scene of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, was armed with a rifle, a shotgun and a handgun \u2014 all of which he bought legally, cops said.\nThe shooter was not previously known to law enforcement, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara told reporters at a press conference."

I am tired of being trans, I wish I never brain-washed myself,\u201d he wrote, according to a translation by The Post.\n\u201cI can\u2019t cut my hair now as it would be an embarrassing defeat, and it might be a concerning change of character that could get me reported. It just always gets in my way. I will probably chop it on the day of the attack.\u201d\nWestman, 23, later wrote that he regretted being trans and just wished he were a girl.\n\u201cI regret being trans.. I wish I was a girl I just know I cannot achieve that body with the technology we have today. I also can\u2019t afford that,\u201d he said.\nThe unhinged shooter also expressed feelings of self-loathing.\n\u201cI like feeling sexy and cute but my face never matches how I feel. I hate my face\u2026 maybe that\u2019s why I like furries so much. You can give yourself a new body and face. I want to be that black face mask on Beyonce\u2019s body lmao!\u201d\nWestman opened fire on the Annunciation Catholic Church and School Wednesday morning while students were praying at Mass, killing two kids and wounding 18 others before taking his own life.\nWestman applied to change his birth name from Robert to Robin in Dakota County, Minn., when he was 17 years old, according to court documents. That name change was granted in January 2020.\nThe petition noted that Westman \u201cidentifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification.\u201d\nHere is the latest on the mass shooting at a Minneapolis Catholic school:\n- Follow live updates on the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting\n- Minneapolis school shooter Robin Westman confessed he was \u2018tired of being trans\u2019: \u2018I wish I never brain-washed myself\u2019\n- First surviving victim in Minneapolis school shooting ID\u2019d\n- Melania Trump \u2018shattered\u2019 to \u2018senseless and depraved\u2019 Minnesota school shooting, calls for \u2018pre-emptive intervention\u2019\nBut, five years later, he seemed to have shrunk away from his new identity, scribbling on another page of the notebook \u201cI don\u2019t want to dress girly all the time but I guess sometimes I really like it. I know I am not a woman but I definitely don\u2019t feel like a man.\u201d\nThe cowardly killings, coupled with the revelation that Westman identified as transgender, reignited a hot-button debate as Minneapolis\u2019 lefty mayor Jacob Frey wagged his finger at news outlets for even reporting it.\n\u201cI have heard about a whole lot of hate that\u2019s being directed at our trans community,\u201d Frey told reporters Wednesday.\n\u201cAnybody who is using this \u2026 as an opportunity to villainize our trans community, or any other community out there, has lost their sense of common humanity. We should not be operating out of a place of hate for anyone,\u201d the mayor said.\nThe Annunciation attack was the second elementary school shooting perpetrated by a trans person in the last two years.\nAudrey Hale, a trans woman, murdered three children and three staffers in a shooting at Covenant School in Nashville, Tenn. in March 2023. Similar to Westman, Hale left behind a rambling manifesto hinting at severe depression and a desire to take her own life in an act of violence targeting innocent victims.\nIn the wake of Wednesday\u2019s school shooting, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. announced a probe by the National Institutes of Health to determine whether drugs Westman was taking during his transition could have played a \u201crole\u201d in his depraved violence.\n\u201cWe are launching studies into their potential contribution,\u201d he said in a response to a question on Fox News\u2019 \u201cFox and Friends\u201d about Hale.\nMinnesota Congressman Tom Emmer on Thursday revealed exclusively to The Post that he was calling for the state to repeal its \u201ctrans refuge law,\u201d a 2023 piece of legislation signed by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz which blocks out-of-state subpoenas, arrest warrants and extradition requests for those who travel to the state for sex-change surgeries or hormone treatments.\n\u201cWe got to respect everyone. We got to have compassion for everyone. But we got to understand that we\u2019ve got some serious mental health issues that are being exacerbated by these types of messages by people like Tim Walz and everybody who supported that law,\u201d said the House Majority Whip, whose district covers many of the Twin Cities\u2019 outer northern and western suburbs.\nNumerous studies point to a link between transgenderism and mental illness. The Trevor Project\u2019s 2024 US National Survey on the Mental Health of LGBTQ+ Young People reported that 39% of LGBTQ+ young people \u201cseriously considered\u201d suicide in the last year \u2014 including a whopping 46% of \u201ctransgender and nonbinary\u201d youths.\nDespite these links and incidents, however, a critical, nationwide debate about the highly controversial topic has never occurred.\nWestman\u2019s chilling writings revealed his violent fantasies about killing children, including wanting to be the \u201cscary horrible monster standing over those powerless kids.\u201d He also glorifies the Sandy Hook massacre, in which 20 schoolchildren were killed.\nWestman\u2019s videos, posted hours before the shootings, also show the phrases \u201ckill Donald Trump\u201d and \u201cfor the children\u201d scrawled on gun magazines.\nHis notebook also showed how he had specifically targeted Annunciation Catholic Church and School, where he graduated from grade school in 2017.\nHis mother, Mary Grace Westman, spent five years working as a secretary at the school until she retired in 2021.\nWestman started shooting through the church\u2019s stained glass windows with a rifle, shotgun and pistol around 8:30 a.m. while schoolchildren and parents were praying. He bought the weapons legally, authorities confirmed. Two students were killed \u201cwhere they sat\u201d in their pews, while 18 others were injured, some critically, police said."
