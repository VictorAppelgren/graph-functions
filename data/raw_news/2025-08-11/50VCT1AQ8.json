The group announced the first part of the This Is For world tour, which will bring the girl group to major cities across Asia and Australia. Fans in other parts of the globe don\u2019t need to worry, however, as more dates and locations will be added to the tour for 2026 when they announce part two. I\u2019ve gathered everything we know about how to get Twice tickets below, and be sure to keep tabs on this story for updated details as they go live.The This Is For world tour is in support of their newest album of the same name. This Is For album is Twice\u2019s fourth studio album and was released on May 19, 2025. The album contains 14 songs, five of which are sub-unit tracks, songs performed by only a few of the girls as opposed to the entire group.Twice is a South Korean girl group formed by JYP Entertainment. It debuted in October 2015 after the group was formed on the reality survival show Sixteen. The girl group has nine members: Jihyo, Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu.If you\u2019re looking for how to get tickets to Twice\u2019s 2025 tour, then we\u2019ve got you covered.

The last known concert date for the tour is December 14 in Bangkok; however, part two of the tour has not been announced yet, so we don\u2019t currently know when or where the tour will come to a close.You can buy standard original tickets for Twice\u2019s This IS For world tour on Live Nation. For each concert date, ticket presale goes live the day before that can be registered for a day in advance.Original tickets have sold out for each concert date so far, which is a trend we expect to continue, so it is recommended to sign up for presale if you\u2019re looking to nab original tickets.Tickets to Twice\u2019s 2025 concert tour can also be purchased through verified resale ticket vendors like StubHub and Vivid Seats. Given how quickly original tickets have been selling, you may find better luck with seating variety and availability on these sites after the seats go live.Original ticket sales have not gone live for all ticket dates, so not all dates are available on StubHub yet. It\u2019s also important to note that resale tickets for Twice's 2025 shows in Asia and Australia aren\u2019t available to purchase on Vivid Seats.Ticket prices for the original This Is For world tour aren\u2019t available to check before ticket sales start at each location; however, on average, tickets to see Twice perform live have historically ranged anywhere between $200 and $300 or $500 to $600, depending on date and location.Of the tickets available on StubHub as of writing, the lowest-cost tickets to Twice\u2019s Japan shows range from $294 for the August 23 show in Aichi to $459 for the Fukuoka show on August 30.Twice does not have any opening acts for its This Is For world tour, which is standard for K-pop concerts.
