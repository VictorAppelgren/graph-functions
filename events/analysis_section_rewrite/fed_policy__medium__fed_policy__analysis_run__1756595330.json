      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**\n\n1. **Canonical Handle Mapping**  \n   - Add explicit references to the S&P 500 (spx) in every substantive claim about index moves.  \n   - Link Fed‑rate‑cut expectations to the UST 10Y (ust10y) and Fed funds futures (fedfunds) where you mention “-25 bp cuts.”  \n   - Tie inflation data to the CPI (cpi) handle and tariff‑driven price pressures to the DXY (dxy) or USD‑JPY (usdJPY) if you discuss currency impacts.  \n   - Include gold (gold) or WTI (wti) if you discuss commodity hedges.\n\n2. **Evidence & Source Alignment**  \n   - Replace the incorrect citation of XTQIQRP5K (blockchain) with a valid source that documents Fed policy or inflation (e.g., a recent Fed statement or CPI release).  \n   - Cite the July CPI release (source ID not provided; add a placeholder or find a real ID).  \n   - For tariff‑driven price pressures, reference the article’s mention of “tariffs” (FAN5RYW6T) and, if possible, a source that quantifies tariff impact on CPI or corporate earnings.  \n   - Provide a source for the “historically weak employment growth” claim (e.g., the BLS jobs report cited in FAN5RYW6T).\n\n3. **Quantification & Magnitude Ranges**  \n   - State the base‑case pullback as “5–10 % decline in spx” with a sign (+ for upside, – for downside).  \n   - Quantify Fed cuts: “–25 bp at the September 16–17 FOMC” (cite fedfunds futures).  \n   - Provide inflation range: “CPI at 2.7 % y/y (July)” and Fed’s preferred CPI at 2.9 % (SOFR‑linked).  \n   - For alternative scenario, give a range: “+2–5 % upside in spx” if tech earnings rebound.\n\n4. **Catalyst Windows & Timing**  \n   - Specify the September 5 payrolls release as the key labor‑market catalyst.  \n   - Mark the July CPI release (July 30) as the inflation catalyst.  \n   - Identify the quarterly earnings window for the top 10 tech names (e.g., Q3 2025 earnings, 1–2 weeks after July 30).  \n   - Note the Fed policy statement date (e.g., September 16–17 FOMC).\n\n5. **Causal Chain & Path‑Dependency**  \n   - Explicitly map: weak labor market → Fed cuts → higher inflation risk → Fed holds rates → spx pullback.  \n   - Show alternative path: labor market stabilizes → Fed holds → tech earnings rebound → spx gains.  \n   - Include a brief note on how tariff‑driven price pressures could feed back into CPI and Fed stance.\n\n6. **Watch‑List Signals**  \n   - List: September 5 payrolls, Fed policy statement (Sept 16–17), July CPI (July 30), Q3 earnings of top 10 tech names (early Aug).  \n   - Add a signal for any surprise in the Fed’s “rate‑cut” decision or a CPI surprise > 0.5 pp.\n\n7. **Confidence Rating**  \n   - Keep “moderate” but justify with the structural concentration risk and policy uncertainty.  \n   - Add a brief note that the confidence is contingent on the Fed’s willingness to cut rates versus maintaining them.\n\n**Bottom‑Line Edit Instructions**  \n- Insert canonical handle tags (spx, ust10y, dxy, cpi, fedfunds) with sign/magnitude.  \n- Replace or add correct source IDs for Fed policy, CPI, and tariff data.  \n- Quantify all ranges and dates.  \n- Ensure every claim has an inline citation.  \n- Remove any sentence that cannot be tied back to a handle or source.",
