  "description": "Tesla Vice President of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy shared estimates of how many customers pay for Full Self-Driving.",
  "content": "Thanks in part to Jay Leno, we now have a better idea about how many Tesla drivers are using Full-Self Driving.Tesla Chief Designer Franz von Holzhausen and Vice President of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy appeared on an episode of \"Jay Leno's Garage\" released Monday. In it, Leno asked how often people use the driver-assistance software.\"You know, it's increasing a lot, like the take rate has gone up from single-digit percentages on all our cars to we're in the teens now,\" Moravy answered. \"On S and X, it's over 50, 60%. And we have a lot of people that use it in these cars like on every drive, you know, you can get addicted to it really quick.\"Tesla released FSD in beta in the US in 2020 and to paying customers across North America two years later.FSD can follow your navigation route, change lanes, and make turns, although it has drawn scrutiny and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigations over some accidents, some of which were fatal. FSD still requires active supervision by a human driver at the wheel.New and existing Model S, Model 3, Model X, Model Y, and Cybertruck owners get a 30-day trial of FSD.Tesla has changed the price of FSD significantly over the years. In 2022, it rose in cost from $10,000 to $12,000 and then to $15,000. Most recently, the price was reduced from $12,000 to $8,000 in 2024. It costs $99 a month on a subscription basis.",
