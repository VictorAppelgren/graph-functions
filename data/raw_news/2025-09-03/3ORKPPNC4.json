  "content": "Former White House aide Alyssa Farah Griffin on Tuesday said President Trump\u2019s decision to target Chicago with federal intervention amidst his crack down on crime is a \u201csmart\u201d move.\n\n\u201cChicago has a crime problem, there\u2018s no doubt. And Donald Trump knows that this is a smart fight for him to pick, not just with his base, but with the country,\u201d Farah Griffin said during a Tuesday appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cAC360.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, 27 people were shot in the Windy City and sever people will killed. Farah Griffin said this warrants a response from leaders including both Trump and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker (D).\n\n\u201cWhat Pritzker seems to be getting right that I don\u2018t think in some of the other instances we\u2018ve seen early on is acknowledge that there is a problem. It\u2018s not right or left to say we need less crime, we need fewer people to be shot in American cities,\u201d she told host Anderson Cooper.\n\n\u201cBut then have the debate over how to do it. National Guard has never been the first step that we should go to. You could coordinate with federal law enforcement, work with the ATF, with the FBI,\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cBut again, this should be happening with the White House and with the governor of the state.\u201d\n\nFarah Griffin added that for now there seems to be \u201cvery little communication\u201d between state officials and the White House as the Trump administration plans to intercede in Chicago.\n\nDespite the president\u2019s repeated statements alleging Chicago would be the next city to experience a federal takeover following Washington and Los Angeles, Pritzker has issued a strong rebuke to the idea of allowing soldiers on the ground in the Prairie State.\n\n\u201cMr. President, do not come to Chicago. You are neither wanted here nor needed here,\u201d Pritzker said during a late August press conference.",
