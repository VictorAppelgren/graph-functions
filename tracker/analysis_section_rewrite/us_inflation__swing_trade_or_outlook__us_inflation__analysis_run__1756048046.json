      "feedback": "The draft shows strong ambition and a plausible macro-to-stock narrative, but it fails to meet the exact Swing Trade/Outlook format and needs tighter first-principles grounding, clearer catalysts, and precise, source-backed quantification. Actionable edits: rebuild the four Swing Trade lines to exact format (Up|Time window|Driver/Mechanism|What to watch|Probability%) with two Up and two Down, ensuring each line is self-contained and anchored to explicit numbers from the material (e.g., Ford’s EV losses ~$1.3B, ROIC ~10%, forward earnings ~10x, dividend yield ~5%, EV capex deferral up to ~$12B) and citing the supporting IDs after the respective facts (22PL3Q360; W2622L6WW; 22PL3Q360; W2622L6WW); prune or consolidate each line so the watch items are one clear trigger and one secondary watchpoint. Strengthen the causal chain with a single, coherent first-principles path: macro regime dynamics drive Ford’s fixed-cost/capex intensity, which shapes EV-margin trajectory, cash flow, and dividend/yield valuation, then feed into multiples and risk premia; avoid mixing unrelated assets in the four lines (keep the main swing anchored to a tradable, or clearly label as a broad Outlook). For the Outlook, replace the misformatted header with a proper Direction|Horizon|Expected path/levels|Decision signals|Invalidation|Trigger|Probability%|Confidence line (one line if non-tradable, or up to 2 if you must show alternate paths), and ground every element in IDs (GX057ADL7; EPJYXB7DX; UPV3X2MQ6; RHXDOHQQX; S15934PBQ; V8TEZOR8R; ILYC1M41F; FOM34PUWA); ensure the Outlook reflects a single, defensible scenario and uses a numeric probability and a credible confidence band. Reconcile conflicts across sources by mapping A/B/C regime logic (Base A: 10x forward earnings, ~5% yield; Transition B: EV profitability progress and capex re-phasing; Tariff/Rate Stress C: higher rates and margin compression) with explicit triggers (EV-margin progression toward breakeven; tariff announcements; debt-path staying near ~2.4T) and cite sources after each assertion. Finally, excise or relegatescape nonessential micro-narratives (Las Vegas price signals, Beasley/polity notes, Synology storage ad) unless you can tie them directly to market-moving catalysts to preserve focus and readability, and ensure every factual claim has a supported ID; that will yield a world-class, parsimonious Swing Trade/Outlook that is format-faithful, evidence-grounded, and decision-ready.",
