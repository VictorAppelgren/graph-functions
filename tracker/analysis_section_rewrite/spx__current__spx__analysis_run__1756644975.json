      "feedback": "**Actionable feedback for the draft**\n\n1. **Keep the focus tight on the S&P 500 (spx) and its immediate 0‑3‑week drivers.** Remove any sentences that drift into broader equity or macro commentary (e.g., “high concentration risk” without tying back to spx).  \n2. **Explicitly map every claim to a canonical handle and provide a quantitative range.**  \n   * Fed dovish stance → spx +0.5 % to +1.0 % if a 25‑bp cut is announced on 16‑17 Sept (B1KYJ1GPU).  \n   * Tesla lawsuit outcome → spx −1 % to −3 % if a liability ruling is adverse; spx +0.5 % to +1.5 % if favorable (LJZYDXVL3).  \n   * Marvell earnings miss → spx −2 % to −4 % if further AI‑sector weakness persists (5GZPY1XUE).  \n   * Tariff escalation → spx −1 % to −2 % if new semiconductor duties are announced (B1KYJ1GPU).  \n3. **Add a clear catalyst window for each driver.**  \n   * Fed meeting: 16‑17 Sept 2025.  \n   * Tesla court filing: 29 Aug 2025 (current filing) with potential new trial date in early Sept.  \n   * Marvell earnings release: 29 Aug 2025.  \n   * Tariff announcement: 13 Aug 2025 (steel/aluminum) and pending semiconductor tariff date.  \n4. **State the expected reaction function and invalidation points.**  \n   * If the Fed cuts earlier than 16‑Sept or if core‑PCE falls below 2 %, the upside bias for spx increases (invalidates downside bias).  \n   * If AI‑sector earnings beat expectations (e.g., Nvidia, AMD), the concentration risk is mitigated, lifting spx beyond current highs.  \n5. **Add cross‑asset transmission paths.**  \n   * Fed cut → lower 10‑yr UST (ust10y) yields → higher spx.  \n   * Tesla ruling → change in tech‑sector weighting → impact on spx and tech‑heavy ETFs (e.g., ndx).  \n   * Tariff escalation → higher manufacturing costs → pressure on spx and industrials.  \n6. **Cite each claim inline with the source ID.** For example: “Fed Governor Christopher Waller’s dovish remarks (B1KYJ1GPU) suggest a 25‑bp cut…”  \n7. **Eliminate any generic platitudes.** Replace “high concentration risk” with the specific 33 % weighting of the Magnificent Seven (56DSYR7J6).  \n8. **Ensure the paragraph ends with a concise, actionable stance**: e.g., “Short‑term, spx is likely to trade 0.5‑1 % higher if the Fed cuts, but remains vulnerable to a 1‑3 % pullback if Tesla’s liability ruling turns negative or if AI‑sector earnings falter.”",
