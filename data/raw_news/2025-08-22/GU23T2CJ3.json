  "description": "From security risks to inefficiency, legacy IT systems are falling short, Aberdeen Research shows. Here's how cloud-based help desk and IT support systems can help.",
  "content": "Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\n\u2022 Aging help desk systems hinder remote support and IT fixes.\n\u2022 28% of businesses are automating IT and help desk services.\n\nAlong with aging help desk systems, businesses face a number of challenges when it comes to building more responsive support capabilities.\n\nAccording to Aberdeen research, 55% of organizations in our survey selected the risk of data breaches as a top hurdle. As cyber threats grow in sophistication and frequency, IT support plays a critical role in incident response, preventative measures, and maintaining data integrity, and poor help desk systems can slow IT's ability to make security fixes.\n\nAlso: How passkeys work: The complete guide to your inevitable passwordless future\n\nAlongside security concerns, the increased use of cloud services, reported by 45% of businesses, is a top pressure in our research for businesses to modernize support and help desks. And there's a growing desire to automate IT and help desk services, with 28% of businesses actively pursuing this.\n\nThe goal is to offload repetitive tasks, free up IT personnel for more complex issues, and provide faster, more consistent support. These pressures highlight a clear need for IT support that is not only reactive but also proactive, secure, and scalable.\n\nAberdeen's research shows that, to meet these evolving demands, businesses are following several key strategies and working to meet specific goals. A top priority for 38% of organizations is to unify IT management and monitoring. This involves consolidating disparate tools and systems into a single platform that provides an end-to-end view of the IT ecosystem, a capability that is core to most cloud-based help desk systems. Such unification streamlines operations, improves visibility into potential issues, and enables faster problem identification and resolution.\n\nAlso: Gartner to CIOs: Prepare to spend more money on generative AI\n\nEqually crucial is the focus on improving remote support and help desk capabilities, a strategic action for 33% of businesses. The rise of remote and hybrid work models has made seamless, accessible support for employees working from diverse locations a core help desk capability. Traditional help desk models, often reliant on in-person interactions or limited remote tools, fall behind in these situations. Organizations need solutions that can effectively reach and assist employees regardless of their physical location, ensuring productivity and minimizing downtime.\n\nWhile working toward modernization and greater efficiency, IT help desks face a set of significant challenges. Many experience pain points when working with a large amount of older software and systems, which affects 46% of help desks. Legacy systems often lack modern integration capabilities, can be difficult to maintain, and may pose security vulnerabilities. Supporting these outdated technologies alongside newer solutions creates a complex and time-consuming task for help desk staff.\n\nAlso: Where the cloud goes from here: 8 trends to follow and what it could all cost\n\nAnother persistent challenge is controlling the cost of IT service and support, reported by 36% of businesses. Finding ways to optimize these costs while simultaneously improving service quality can be a difficult task for many organizations.\n\nA potential solution for these support issues is the use of cloud-based help desk and IT support systems, which Aberdeen's research shows 49% of businesses use in some form. Among the advantages of cloud-based help desks is scalability, allowing organizations to easily adjust capacity to meet fluctuating demand without significant upfront hardware investments. They also offer enhanced accessibility, enabling support teams and end-users to connect from anywhere, directly addressing the need for improved remote support.\n\nAlso: The best remote access software of 2025: Expert tested\n\nAlso, since they are essentially constantly updated and hardened, cloud platforms typically provide strong security features and compliance certifications, helping to mitigate the risk of data breaches and meet regulatory requirements. And the burden of maintenance and updates shifts from the in-house IT team to the help desk provider, freeing up valuable internal resources to focus on more strategic initiatives.\n\nAberdeen's research shows that organizations using these cloud-based systems are seeing some critical benefits and competitive advantages. We've found that businesses are reporting more efficient IT processes (42%) and improved IT productivity (35%), achieved by streamlining workflows, automating ticketing, and leveraging easier access to information.\n\nBeyond operational gains, 29% of businesses have seen improved cybersecurity by leveraging the advanced security protocols and expertise of cloud providers. Crucially, 27% have reported improved support for remote workers, underscoring the cloud's ability to overcome geographical limitations and deliver consistent service to a distributed workforce.\n\nAlso: How ChatGPT saved me time troubleshooting 3 annoying tech support issues\n\nPlanning to modernize and build efficiencies in IT support is one thing, but actually being able to do it in a timely and cost-effective manner is another. That is why nearly half of businesses are leveraging cloud-based solutions to improve help desk and support capabilities.\n\nBy taking advantage of cloud-based help desks, organizations can overcome cost and complexity hurdles while speeding adoption and moving their IT on the path to increased modernization. With these solutions in place, businesses can improve the quality of support, increase their security, and reduce costs.",

Instead of trudging through the house, I can use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to gain access to one of those remote desktops.\nHowever, setting up something like Xrdp (one of the Linux implementations of RDP) can be challenging, especially when communicating between different X servers (such as X.org to Wayland). Because of this, I turn to an application that vastly simplifies the setup and connection of remote machines.\nAlso: 5 best Linux distros for staying anonymous - when a VPN isn't enough\nThat application is called NoMachine. With this wonderfully designed GUI app, you can make those connections so easily that you'll wonder why you hesitated.\nI'll walk you through the installation and usage of NoMachine so you can enjoy remote desktop usage on your LAN.\nAre you ready for this?\nHow to set up remote desktop access to your Linux computers\nInstalling NoMachine\nWhat you'll need: I will demonstrate this process connecting two Ubuntu-based distributions (Pop!_OS and Ubuntu). NoMachine is available for RPM and DEB-based distributions. To use NoMachine, you'll need two different Linux machines and a user with sudo privileges.\n1. Download the installer file\nPoint your browser to the NoMachine download page and download either the RPM or DEB file for your architecture. In my case, I need the DEB for amd64.\n2. Install NoMachine\nOnce the file has downloaded, open your terminal window and install NoMachine with the command:\nsudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/nomachin*.deb\nYou'll need to install NoMachine on both systems. With NoMachine, you can connect an Ubuntu-based machine to a Fedora-based machine, so it doesn't matter which you're using.\nUsing NoMachine\n1. Start the service on the remote machine\nTo use NoMachine, it must be running on both the local and remote machines. On the remote machine, you'll start the app labeled NoMachine Service. Do that and the NoMachine window will open, indicating the service is running. From that same window, you can also configure the service as needed, but it should work fine out of the box.\n2. Start the client app\nOn the local machine (the one you'll use to connect to the remote desktop), open the NoMachine app from the desktop menu. When you do this, your remote machine will automatically be detected, so all you need to do is double-click on the icon for the remote machine.\n3. Connect to the remote machine\nAfter you've double-clicked on the remote machine, you'll have to verify the host identification. To do that, click OK when prompted. You'll then need to type the username and password for a remote user on the other machine and click OK.\nAfter the connection is made, you'll have to walk through a welcome wizard by clicking OK until you find yourself in control of the remote desktop.\nAlso: How to install Ubuntu Server in under 30 minutes\nCongratulations, you've just set up remote desktop access on your Linux machines.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

But I recently learned, thanks to ZDNET's sister site PCMag, that your device itself also supports many secret phone codes that unlock hidden menus. Admittedly, these are mostly something only techies or developers would need to access or tinker with, but if you're anything like me, learning the hacky ins and outs of your device is incredibly fun.\nAlso: Before you quit Netflix, use these secret codes to unlock its full library of shows\nSo I did a little research, found a long list of phone codes or short codes, and tried them all to see what they do. They're not all for pros -- some are surprisingly useful for everyday people who just want to, for instance, see if they have call waiting enabled.\nThese codes work on both Android and iPhone unless otherwise noted as device-specific. A few are carrier-specific, however, meaning they'll only work if you're on a particular mobile network (like AT&T, Verizon, or T-Mobile). And fair warning: A handful of the codes can make big changes or even wipe your phone, so read carefully before typing them into your keypad.\n*#06#\nShow your IMEI (iPhone and Android)\nEntering *#06# into your iPhone's dialer and pressing the green call button will display your device's unique identification number, known as the IMEI, along with your EID -- a unique 32-digit serial number found on devices that support eSIM technology. If you have a dual SIM or eSIM phone, you'll see more than one IMEI listed. This number is often needed when reporting a stolen phone, checking warranty status, or unlocking your device for use on another carrier.\nAlso: Your Roku has secret settings and menu screens - here's how to unlock them\nTip: On an iPhone, you can also find the IMEI under Settings > General > About, but using the code is faster.\n*3001#12345#*\nBring up the FTM Dashboard (iPhone only)\nType *3001#12345#* to open the \"FTM Dashboard\" (Field Test Mode Dashboard) -- a hidden engineering menu that displays your carrier, capabilities, phone number, cell tower IDs, network bands, and your signal strength measured in dBm instead of bars. You'll also see other information listed in this menu, although much of it is jargon only technicians would understand.\n*#*#4636#*#*\nBring up a testing panel (Android only)\nOK, while the code above is for iPhone users, this one is for Android users. It opens a technical menu with phone status, LTE/5G info, Wi-Fi details, app usage stats, and battery history. It's mainly intended for technicians diagnosing connectivity issues or checking detailed system health. Most people probably won't understand it.\nAlso: How to clear your Android phone cache (and give it a serious speed boost)\n*#67# and *#21#\nCheck call forwarding (iPhone and Android, on some carriers)\nSome carriers let you dial these codes to see if call forwarding is enabled and which number your phone is currently forwarding calls to -- either when you're busy (*#67#) or for all calls (*#21#). You can change it to forward calls to another number, such as your home, office, or a third-party answering service, in settings.\nOn iPhone, to change the forwarding number, go to Settings > Phone > Call Forwarding. On Android, the steps vary, but generally you'll open the Phone app, tap the three-dot menu, go to Settings > Calling accounts, select your active SIM, and then look for the call forwarding option.\nIf you see \"Failed/Error\" instead of \"Enabled/Disabled\" displayed after entering these codes -- and you don't see call forwarding in your settings -- it likely means your carrier doesn't support the feature on your plan.\n*#43#\nCheck call waiting (iPhone and Android, on some carriers)\nSimilar to the call forwarding menu above, dialing *#43# lets you check whether call waiting is enabled -- the feature that alerts you to another incoming call while you're already on one.\nTo enable call waiting on an iPhone, go to Settings > Phone > Call Waiting and toggle the switch on. On an Android phone, you typically open the Phone app, then go to Settings > Calls > Supplementary Services > Call Waiting and toggle it on, though the steps may vary by device.\nAlso: How to clear your iPhone cache (and why it makes such a big difference)\nIf you enter the code and see \"Failed/Error\" instead of \"Enabled/Disabled\" -- and you can't find a call waiting option in your phone's settings -- your carrier likely doesn't support this feature on your plan.\n*21[number]#\nForward all calls (iPhone and Android, on some carriers)\nCall forwarding is useful if you're traveling, using a different phone temporarily, or want all calls sent to a work or home line instead of your mobile. With this code, it's easy to forward all incoming calls to another number -- just enter *21[number]# into your dialer. (The number that's in brackets will be the destination for your calls.) As mentioned earlier, you can also enable or disable call forwarding in settings if your carrier and plan support it.\n#225, *225#, and #225#\nCheck bill balance (iPhone and Android, on some carriers)\nChecking your bill balance is quick and easy with these codes. They work right from your dialer, so you don't have to log in to an app or website to see what you owe. On Verizon, dial #225 to get a text message with your current balance. AT&T customers can dial *225# for the same information, while T-Mobile users can dial #225#.\nAlso: Changing these iOS 18 settings significantly improved my iPhone's battery life\n#3282, *3282#, and #932#\nCheck data usage (iPhone and Android, on some carriers)\nIf you want to keep tabs on your data usage, each major carrier has its own code. Verizon customers can dial #3282, AT&T users can dial *3282#, and T-Mobile customers can dial #932#. You'll get a text showing how much data you've used and, in most cases, when the cycle resets -- great for avoiding overage charges or throttling.\n#768 and *729\nPay your bill (iPhone and Android, on some carriers)\nNeed to pay your phone bill? Verizon makes it easy with the code #768. To make a payment over the phone with T-Mobile, you can use the code *729.\nAlso: Installed iOS 18.6 on your iPhone? Change these 11 settings for the best experience\n*5005*25371#\nTest Emergency Alert Status (iPhone only)\nYour iPhone can receive emergency, government, and public safety alerts, including AMBER alerts, extreme weather warnings, and imminent threat notifications. By default, these are turned on, and you'll hear a loud, alarm-like sound when one arrives. You can enable or disable them anytime by going to Settings > Notifications and toggling the alert types under Government Alerts.\nYou can also dial *5005*25371# to check if your phone is set to receive test alerts from government and emergency services. This code doesn't trigger a real alert -- it simply returns a yes or no to confirm whether the feature is enabled. If it's on and you'd rather disable it without going into settings, dial *5005*25370# and press the call button to turn it off.\n*#07#\nSee legal and regulatory info (iPhone and Android)\nWant to see your phone's compliance and safety information? Dial *#07# to quickly access warranty info, FCC details, and RF exposure guidelines. It's essentially a scrolling page of legal text.\nAlso: Your iPhone has a secret in-car feature that's seriously underutilized - here's how to access it\n*67\nHide Caller ID for one call (iPhone and Android)\nIn the US, dialing *67 before a phone number hides your caller ID for that one call, making \"Private Number\" appear on the recipient's screen, which is useful when calling businesses or people you don't know well. Outside the US, the equivalent code is *31#, so it works the same way in regions where *67 isn't supported.\nTip: If your caller ID is normally hidden but you want it to appear just once, dial *82 before the number to temporarily unblock it.\n511\nGet traffic information (iPhone and Android, on some carriers)\nThis isn't technically a code, but it's a handy number you can dial in the US. Calling 511 connects you to your state's traffic info line, giving you real-time road updates and travel information without using data. It's useful if you don't have enough service to load GPS, or if you're close to hitting your data cap but can still make a call.\nAlso: Android phone feeling slow? I changed these 4 settings to revitalize the whole system\n*2767*3855#\nFactory reset (Android only -- danger!)\nI didn't test this code because reports say it will instantly wipe an Android phone and reinstall its original firmware -- with no warning screen. Yikes. I suggest using it only if you're selling, recycling, or fully restoring your device, as it will completely erase everything and start fresh.\nFAQs\nWhat's the difference between phone codes and short codes?\nI call the codes in this guide \"phone codes\" throughout, but you may notice some carriers refer to their specific codes as \"short codes.\" They're the same thing.\nAre phone codes dangerous to use?\nMost are safe, like the bill pay and data balance codes. But the factory reset code I mentioned last can reportedly erase all your data instantly, so it definitely comes with a big warning.\nAre some codes carrier-specific?\nYes. Many of the codes I mentioned only work on certain mobile networks because they're provided by those carriers.\nWill all codes work on my phone?\nNo. Some are platform-specific (Android or iPhone), and some are tied to carriers.\nWhat if I mess something up?\nIf you enabled or disabled something by accident, you can undo it through your phone's settings or by re-entering the code. If that fails, back up your data and perform a reset."

In the old days, I would have searched page after page on the web looking for clues. But now I can turn to AI to help me work out the problem. A good AI can serve up the right troubleshooting steps for me to follow until I find a solution, or at least a workaround.\nAlso: How ChatGPT actually works (and why it's been so game-changing)\nThough any AI should be able to act as a support assistant, I've relied on ChatGPT the past few times I needed to tackle a technical glitch. I subscribe to ChatGPT Plus, but the free version of ChatGPT is equally capable of helping you resolve issues with troublesome hardware, software, and anything in between. Here's how it worked for me and how it might work for you as well.\n1. Passkey syncing problem\nI recently wrote an article for ZDNET on \"How to sync passkeys in Chrome across your Android, iPhone, Mac, or PC\" in which I explained how to use Google's Password Manager to set up and sync passkeys across a range of devices.\nThe process went relatively smoothly with most of the devices, except for my Google Pixel Android phone. Any passkey I created on this phone synced with the other devices. Passkeys that I created on my iPhone 16 Pro, Windows PC, and Mac synced among themselves, but they failed to sync with my Android phone. After trying to troubleshoot this on my own, I called on ChatGPT.\nAlso: How passkeys work: The complete guide to your inevitable passwordless future\nThe AI first covered the basics, asking me to review all the settings across all devices to confirm that they were correct. It listed each specific setting in bullet point format and told me how to check them. I asked it to clarify one particular instruction, which it cited as a good question, and it cleared up the confusion.\nAfter reviewing all the settings and still having trouble, I provided more feedback to ChatGPT. The AI then summarized the entire scenario and told me that this sounded less like a device or settings issue and more like a Google-side limitation or bug, possibly tied to how and where passkeys are created and stored when generated outside of Android.\nI then explained that creating a passkey on my Android device and syncing it with the other devices also synced any passkeys on those other devices with my Android phone. That was the only way I found to get around the issue. With that tidbit in mind, the AI cited the problem as a partial sync bug or design flaw, one that would require sending a bug report to Google, which ChatGPT offered to help me file.\nAlso: 10 passkey survival tips: Prepare for your passwordless future now\nBut to deal with the issue now, the AI suggested creating or regenerating a passkey on Android (even just a test one) every time I create one on another device. Doing so will then \"nudge\" Android into refreshing the full passkey list from my Google Account. Though the solution may not be ideal, at least ChatGPT offered a viable workaround until the process is fixed.\n2. iPhone connection trouble\nHere's another issue I bumped into recently. My Windows desktop computer suddenly stopped seeing my iPhone. I'd plug in the iPhone via USB, but neither File Explorer nor iTunes recognized the phone. Even Device Manager wouldn't see it. Other devices, including my iPad and a test iPhone, were recognized. And connecting my iPhone to my Windows laptop worked fine. I even tried different USB cables, all to no avail. So there was some disconnect between my desktop and my iPhone.\nAlso: I dialed these 14 secret codes to unlock hidden features on my Android and iPhone\nAfter some troubleshooting on my own, I hollered for ChatGPT and described the problem in detail.\nThe AI first suggested resetting the Location and Privacy settings, which I had already done and which had not fixed the problem. It then suggested disconnecting the phone, stopping a couple of Apple processes on my computer via Task Manager, and then reconnecting the phone. None of those did the trick either.\nNext, it told me to manually reinstall the Apple Mobile Device USB Driver, suggesting that this step should fix the glitch. Following the specific steps that ChatGPT provided, I reinstalled the driver. I then checked Device Manager. And hooray, my iPhone appeared once again. Firing up File Explorer and iTunes, my iPhone popped up as usual.\nAlso: Installed iOS 18.6 on your iPhone? Change these 11 settings for the best experience\nHere, I was impressed that ChatGPT not only provided the correct solution but said that it suspected an Apple Mobile Device USB driver mismatch as the likely culprit. At the end, the AI even offered to create a batch file I could run if this problem ever occurs again. I downloaded and inspected the batch file through a link in the conversation and saw that it covered all the steps ChatGPT had provided.\n3. Mouse and mouse pad conflict\nFor the third glitch, I presented ChatGPT with a conflict between my mouse and my mouse pad. I have an old Microsoft Classic IntelliMouse, an optical wired mouse. In the past, I was able to use it on top of a mouse pad. Recently, though, the mouse pointer no longer moves smoothly as I drag the mouse across the pad. Sometimes, it slows down. Other times, it stutters and pauses as I move the mouse.\nAlso: Your Windows PC has a secretly useful backup tool - here's how to access it\nI tried three different mouse pads, and the issue is the same with each one. If I position and drag the mouse across my desk, the pointer moves smoothly.\nIn response, ChatGPT advised me to clean the mouse pad with a damp cloth and let it dry. It also recommended that I clean around the lens of the mouse with a soft microfiber cloth, a cotton swab, or compressed air. I had already tried those steps but ran through them again.\nNext, it suggested trying a different USB port for the mouse but acknowledged that this was an unlikely source of the problem since the mouse works fine directly on my desk. The AI also said that a driver conflict can sometimes cause cursor stuttering and directed me to uninstall the mouse driver through Device Manager and reboot. I had already tried both steps but went through them one more time. Still no dice.\nAlso: Here are all the GPT-5 updates OpenAI has rolled out since launch\nAfter reporting all the results to the AI, the consensus was that the mouse's optical sensor may be aging or partially failing, either because the LED isn't illuminating the surface evenly anymore or the CMOS sensor inside is no longer capturing a clear surface image. Those explanations made sense since the mouse worked fine across all mouse pads in the past. For now, I'll have to use the mouse directly on my desk, which is a bit clumsy. But ChatGPT did recommend replacement mice similar to the Classic IntelliMouse, which I accepted as a long-term solution."

      "text": "5 reasons to switch to an immutable Linux distro today - and which to try first\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- Immutable Linux distributions are the future.\n- There are several reasons why immutable is the way to go.\n- From security to predictability, you can't go wrong with immutable.\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\nImmutable Linux distributions sound complicated, right?\nYou'd be surprised to know that it's actually quite simple. Essentially, an immutable distribution is one that has certain crucial directories set in read-only mode so they can't be changed. If you want a more in-depth look at what an immutable Linux distribution is, make sure to read all about them in this piece by my esteemed colleague, Steven Vaughan-Nichols.\nAlso: 6 most Windows-like Linux distros because old habits die hard\nThe most important thing you need to know about them is the read-only component. Now that you have a very basic idea of what an immutable distribution is, what are the reasons why you should use one?\n1. Improved security\nThis is the single most important aspect of immutable distributions. Because the core of the system is mounted in read-only mode, it cannot be changed. With the core system locked down as read-only, it's not possible to change settings in directories like /etc, /boot, /dev, /proc, or other critical locations. That means if you wound up with malware on your system, it wouldn't be able to alter the contents of those directories.\nAlso: 5 Linux distros I recommend to help businesses cut costs and boost security\nThat also means those who are new to Linux won't be able to make the same kind of mistakes they might make on a non-immutable distribution (as in editing the /etc/fstab file in such a way that renders the system unbootable).\nImmutable distributions lock down an already secure operating system.\n2. Better reliability\nIn a similar vein to security, immutability makes Linux even more reliable. That's saying something, given how reliable Linux already is. With the core system locked down, changes cannot be made that would cause the system to become unreliable. On top of that, you're limited to the methods of installing applications. Immutable systems rely heavily on Flatpak because the universal installer sandboxes an installed application, such that it cannot easily modify anything within the core system.\nAlso: My 10 favorite Linux distributions of all time, ranked\nBecause of this, immutable distributions are more reliable than non-immutable. Even better, if you accidentally break something, it will most likely be fixed during the next reboot. On top of that, third-party applications can't change anything that would result in an unstable OS.\n3. Atomic updates\nAtomic updates are quite different from standard updates. Instead of the OS treating an update on a package-by-package basis, it's an all-or-none situation. In other words, if an update to a single package would break something, the update will not happen and the system rolls back to the previous working state.\nAlso: You can try Linux without ditching Windows first - here's how\nEven during the update, the system creates a new image on a separate partition and the updates happen there (instead of on your main partition), while you're using the machine. When you next reboot your system, the updates are applied. Again, if anything within that update would break something, it all rolls back to your previous state.\n4. Simplified maintenance\nBecause of the simplified (and more reliable) upgrade process, fewer dependency issues, and the ability to maintain a working system state, immutable distribution maintenance is far easier than with standard distributions.\nAlso: The best Linux distros for beginners in 2025 make switching from MacOS or Windows so easy\nAnother benefit to immutable maintenance is that, thanks to the focus on containerized applications, you don't have to worry about apps interfering with one another, so it's less likely to have issues where one application overwrites another, locks a library, or interferes with the startup of another app or, gasp, the OS itself.\n5. Reproducibility\nWith an immutable system, you are always guaranteed to have a bootable system. The updates for an immutable system have been well-tested by the developers, which means the updates are easily reproducible. There's a certain level of comfort, knowing that updates are reproducible and reliable. On a non-immutable system, reproducibility is not always guaranteed. If something breaks, you can't count on the system to produce a running image that can be applied when things go wrong.\nAlso: The 6 best Linux distros for students - from elementary to college\nIf you're curious about immutable distributions, consider one of the following:"

But they're typically large and bulky, designed for mechanics and HVAC engineers, which limits their usability when it comes to inspecting device ports or probing around cracks and crevices looking for a lost fastener.\nAlso: I replaced my MacBook charger with this compact wall unit - and wish I'd done it sooner\nIn my quest to find a small, portable, low-cost camera for confined spaces, I found this one from Amazon, designed specifically to inspect ear canals.\nAlthough that is its advertised purpose, this tiny 1080p HD camera can be used for a variety of tech needs. I'm not a doctor so I'm not going to be recommending that you insert this camera into any orifice. If you're going down that route, you're on your own! I'm also not reviewing any of the ear cleaning tools. I'll leave that to someone else.\nInstead, what we have here is a compact 360-degree wide-angle 1080p camera that's perfect for use as an inspection device. The camera is kitted out with six tiny LED lights at the tip, lighting the way to whatever tiny port, socket, or internal mechanism you get into.\nThe business end of the unit is IP67 rated for water- and schmoo-resistance, and you can use a cloth or alcohol wipe to clean it. Even despite the camera and LEDs, the end of the camera is just 0.17 inches/4.3 mm in diameter.\nAlso: I finally found a lightweight multitool that doesn't sacrifice function for form - and it's only $30\nThe camera connects to both iOS and Android, where you can see what the camera sees, take photos and video, and also control the light on the front. It connects using Wi-Fi, and that process is smooth and straightforward.\nInside the camera is a 350mAh battery that's rechargeable using USB-C. It's good for 90 minutes on a full charge, and can hold its charge for at least a month.\nThere is a little metal prong on the end of the unit that takes little silicone sleeves for digging about in your ear canal, and you can choose to keep this or snip it off.\nWhy I recommend this product\nLet's get the price out of the way. This camera, including a charge cable and all the bits you're supposed to put in your ear (but that I will bin) is only $10. For that price, it makes this an excellent camera that I'm not scared about damaging.\nTalking about damage, my last one cost about $25, used microUSB for charging, and lasted a few years until I \"damaged\" it by dropping a portable power station on it. I had no hesitation in getting a new one, and this one has been in use for a few weeks now. It's a perfect addition to my toolkit."

      "text": "Gartner to CIOs: Prepare to spend more money on generative AI\nYou know all that money your company may already be spending on generative AI products and projects? Well, be prepared to spend a lot more in the coming year.\nAlso: How to use ChatGPT: A beginner's guide to the most popular AI chatbot\nAs generative AI, or gen AI, becomes more integral to business operations and consumer products, spending is expected to rise dramatically. In its latest forecast, Gartner predicts that the amount of money spent around the world on this hot flavor of AI will total $644 billion this year, an increase of 76.4% from last year.\nThe promise of gen AI\nOne problem with gen AI, as it currently stands, is that the technology is still in its nascent stages and often flawed and fallible. This is typified by the tendency for AI to hallucinate or deliver inaccurate, incorrect, or misleading results. As a result, many CIOs and other tech executives have been disappointed with the high failure rates of AI.\nAlso: 10 key reasons AI went mainstream overnight - and what happens next\nHowever, the promise of gen AI has led AI providers and other companies to continue investing billions of dollars in the technology. The goal is to enhance and improve the size, performance, and reliability of AI models to address current weaknesses.\nDue to the existing limitations of gen AI, internal projects will face greater scrutiny this year, according to John-David Lovelock, Distinguished VP Analyst at Gartner. And where will companies then focus their time, energy, and money?\n\"Ambitious internal projects from 2024 will face scrutiny in 2025, as CIOs opt for commercial off-the-shelf solutions for more predictable implementation and business value,\" Lovelock said. \"Despite model improvements, CIOs will reduce POC [proof of concept] and self-development efforts, focusing instead on gen AI features from existing software providers.\"\nBreaking down the forecast\nSome 80% of the increased spending on gen AI will focus on integrating AI into existing hardware, such as servers, PCs, and smartphones. But company spending on AI software and services will also surge. Breaking down its forecast for 2025, Gartner anticipates that businesses will spend $27.7 billion on services, $37.1 billion on software, $180.6 billion on servers, and $398.3 billion on devices, all dramatic increases from last year.\nLooking ahead even further, Gartner expects that manufacturers will increasingly add AI skills to their devices, whether or not consumers necessarily want them.\nAlso: Generative AI is finally finding its sweet spot, says Databricks chief AI scientist\n\"The market's growth trajectory is heavily influenced by the increasing prevalence of AI-enabled devices, which are expected to comprise almost the entire consumer device market by 2028,\" Lovelock added. \"However, consumers are not chasing these features. As manufacturers embed AI as a standard feature in consumer devices, consumers will be forced to purchase them.\"\nNo signs of stopping\nThe still untapped promises of gen AI and its often seen pitfalls are typified by a feature like Apple Intelligence. Apple touted its iPhone 16 lineup based largely on the benefits of generative AI to transform the way you work, play, and communicate. In reality, the feature has failed to deliver on those promises, with some of its promoted skills either not working as expected or being delayed further and further.\nAlso: Worried about DeepSeek? Turns out, Gemini collects more user data\nBut if Gartner is correct in its forecast, we're on an AI ride that shows no signs of stopping. For now, vendors will continue to push gen AI into their products while customers wait for it to realize its potential. To further those goals, all sides will have to open their wallets in hopes that generative AI will become the game changer that it aspires to be.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

I did the math for Windows and Mac users\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- RAM is an important hardware resource that allows a computer to perform optimally and at fast speeds.\n- Escalating computing demands have made 16GB of RAM the new standard for PCs and laptops if they are to continue performing at their best.\n- Even then, 16GB of memory may not be enough for certain users, so it's important know when to upgrade.\nGet more in-depth ZDNET tech coverage: Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\nI used to struggle when shopping for a new computer. Over time, I learned to narrow things down to what I call the \"performance trifecta\" -- three main components you should be mindful of when buying a laptop or desktop: processor, storage drive, and RAM. The first two are pretty easy to figure out. A good processor ensures that a computer performs well, and a lot of local storage means you'll have plenty of room for all your files.\nAlso: One of the best work laptops I've tested has MacBook written all over it (but it's even better)\nMemory is a component I don't think many people fully understand or pay attention to (I was certainly a part of this group). RAM, or random access memory, is essentially a computer's short-term memory. Instead of saving data directly onto an SSD, the computer stores files temporarily in the RAM for quick access. That way, the device won't need to use its storage to open a document or software resources, ensuring fast performance.\nThere's a lot of information and differing opinions regarding RAM and how much you need on your computer. Should you opt for the laptop with the 32GB LPDDR5X RAM, or will 16GB be enough? I'm here to cut through all the fog and provide easy-to-understand advice on the amount of memory you should get.\nHow much RAM do you need in 2025?\nThe short answer: it depends on the operating system. For Windows machines, 16GB of RAM has become the operational minimum on new consumer laptops. Modern workloads have ramped up to such a degree that less RAM on a Windows device is fine, but it will limit you to everyday tasks like writing emails, internet browsing or watching YouTube videos.\nBut let's be real here: the average worker is probably running dozens of tabs in their browser, a handful of apps in the background, and (possibly) generative AI, all of which demand memory power. In that sense, most people using their Windows laptops for work will want at least 16GB (for a value-driven, future-proof option) for a smooth user experience.\nAlso: Why I highly recommend the M4 MacBook Air to most people (and now it's on sale)\nWhen it comes to MacBooks, things are a little bit different. Because Apple's machines are so optimized to handle daily workflows, 8GB of RAM goes a bit further than a stock laptop running Windows. In fact, it wasn't until only recently that Apple made 16GB the starting point with the new MacBook Air M4.\nMacBooks with 8GB are still solid machines for daily use, while more powerful models like the MacBook Pro and MacBook Pro Max offer substantial power with 24GB, 36GB, or more, making them some of the most powerful laptops on the market (and some of the priciest).\nBesides just Windows and Macs, Chromebooks are a third category of consumer laptops that have seen a spike in popularity over the last few years due to their average lower price and lightweight operating system: ChromeOS.\nBecause ChromeOS is so streamlined, Chomebooks can get along just fine with 8GB or even less, making them great machines for handling the basics like working out of the browser and having your Google Suite at your fingertips with snappy performance and a low price. The trade-off, however, is that you'll have less access to apps you'd otherwise find on Windows.\nAlso: Is a refurbished MacBook viable in 2025? I did the math, and here's my expert advice\nAll in all, it's true to say that the more memory you have, the better your computer should perform. But having too much RAM can also be a poor return on investment because you end up spending money on a resource that you hardly ever use to its fullest extent. It's like owning a big house but only using a few of the rooms.\nWhen buying a new laptop, I just recommend having a clear understanding of what you want to use it for -- that way you can make a realistic expectation about how much RAM you need.\nWhat does DDR5 mean?\nSometimes, when shopping for a computer, you'll see the letters \"DDR\" followed by a number. This is an acronym that stands for \"double data rate.\" Without getting too deep into the weeds, DDR is a type of technology that improves the data transfer speed from RAM to other components, such as the processor. There have been five main DDR generations so far, with the latest and fastest standard being DDR5.\nAlso: I found the 5 best laptop sales - just in time for back to school\nSimilar to 16GB of memory, DDR technology has effectively become the new standard for RAM as users demand faster speeds. There are also variations of the technology. A notable version is LPDDR5X, which stands for low-power double data rate 5X, a more energy-efficient version of DDR5 designed specifically for mobile devices.\nDon't expect DDR6 RAM to be released for a computer near you anytime soon. We saw the JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council) announce the release of LPDDR6 back in early July. The JEDEC is the organization that established DDR as a standard for computers. The technology is available for manufacturers to implement in their devices, but whether or not it'll happen -- or how soon -- is yet to be seen.\nWant more laptop advice? Add ZDNET as a preferred Google source on Chrome and Chromium browsers.\nWhen should you upgrade?\n16GB is fine for most cases, although if you're a gamer or creative professional, you should consider opting for 32GB of RAM. More RAM will ensure that the games you play and the video-editing apps you use for work operate more smoothly. I have that amount for my personal computer, and I'm very happy with that setup because I don't just write.\nI also play games on my desktop, edit photographs and videos, and run virtual machines, among other things. It's a heavy workload that requires the correct amount of resources to operate; even then, I am considering upgrading my PC to have more. It's not uncommon for me to see my workload take up over 70% of my computer's total RAM.\nAlso: The best mini PCs you can buy\nI consider anything above 32GB of memory excessive unless you're a specific type of user. If you're editing 8K videos or running heavy apps simultaneously, then you'll probably need 48GB or 64GB of RAM. A good laptop that can deliver would be something like the M4 MacBook Pro or the Dell Premium 16. These are solid, top-of-the-line machines capable of tackling tough workloads.\nWhy should you trust me?\nI've been writing about both software and consumer electronics for almost 10 years now, and in that time, I've worked in many different settings, from the traditional office to the home office, and even someone's backyard. The remote experience has made me extremely selective about what I choose to make my main computer, as I want to ensure the devices I use can handle my day-to-day tasks. I'm on my computer all day, practically every day of the week.\nAlso: I tested several AIO computers in 2025, and these are the best for your office setup\nI'm also at a point where I've tried just about every type of laptop on the market. I know which features and specs you should look out for when purchasing a new computer -- and which ones are not worth your time.\nThe advice I have given is not a set of hard and fast rules. I just aim to provide a foundation of what you should look for in a laptop. What is best for you depends on your unique needs."

      "text": "How passkeys work: The complete guide to your inevitable passwordless future\nI've been writing a lot about passkeys recently -- and with good reason. This year, some of the world's largest technology companies are doubling down on efforts to convince their billions of global users to start using passkeys instead of passwords when signing into websites, apps, and other services.\nPasswords versus passkeys\nHow passkeys work\nPasskeys are often described as a passwordless technology. In order for passwords to work as a part of the authentication process, the website, app, or other service -- collectively referred to as the \"relying party\" -- must keep a record of that password in its end-user identity management system. This way, when you submit your password at login time, the relying party can check to see if the password you provided matches the one it has on record for you.\nThe process is the same, whether or not the password on record is encrypted. In other words, with passwords, before you can establish a login, you must first share your secret with the relying party. From that point forward, every time you go to login, you must send your secret to the relying party again. In the world of cybersecurity, passwords are considered shared secrets, and no matter who you share your secret with, shared secrets are considered risky.\nAlso: Biometrics vs. passcodes: What lawyers say if you're worried about warrantless phone searches\nMany of the largest and most damaging data breaches in history might not have happened had a malicious actor not discovered a shared password.\nIn contrast, passkeys also involve a secret, but that secret is never shared with a relying party. Passkeys are a form of Zero Knowledge Authentication (ZKA). The relying party has zero knowledge of your secret, and in order to sign in to a relying party, all you have to do is prove to the relying party that you have the secret in your possession.\nHere's the big idea behind passkeys: If you never have to share your secret with a legitimate relying party, then you'll never accidentally share your secret with a malicious actor like a phisher or smisher, either. But humans are so programmed to think that we need to share secret passwords that it's difficult for us to fathom how it could work any other way.\nSo, how exactly is this possible? After all, it seems counterintuitive. And why is it so much safer than passwords?\nPublic key cryptography is the foundation of passkeys\nTo understand how passkeys work, it's important to cover some basics of public key cryptography. In the same way that a physical key is matched to a specific lock, public key cryptography involves two digital keys -- a public key and a private key -- that are matched and unique to one another. A set of these uniquely matched keys is called a public/private key pair; behind every unique passkey exists one of these unique pairs.\nWhat's so special about a public/private key pair? Let's say I give you the public key that matches a private (and secret) key in my possession. You can use that public key to scramble (encrypt) a message. When you send that message to me, as long as I'm the only one who has the matching private key, I'm the only one who can unscramble (decrypt) that message.\nAlso: If we want a passwordless future, let's get our passkey story straight\nThe public key cannot be used to decrypt that message or derive the private key. The existence of public key cryptography technology means that I can give away my public key to as many people as I want, and they can all use that same key to send me encrypted messages. Meanwhile, I am the only one who can decrypt those messages because I am the only one in possession of the secret private key.\nAlso, I can use my private key to digitally sign any messages that I might send to the holders of the matching public key. This way, the public key-holding recipients of any such messages can use their public key to validate that the message came from someone in possession of the matching secret private key. This capability plays a special role when it comes to the ZKA aspect of passkeys: convincing a relying party that I have the secret part of the passkey -- the private key -- without having to divulge the secret to them.\nUnlike with passkeys, you must risk sharing your secret password with a relying party (as described above) before that password will work as a login credential with that relying party; with passkeys, you never take that risk.\nFour passkey workflows everyone should know\nFor most users, there are four passkey-related processes (workflows) to be aware of.\nDiscovery and engagement with the relying party's passkey functionality -- Among those relying parties that support passkeys, there's no standard for how their passkey functionality is advertised or accessed by the user. From one relying party to the next, not only might the user experience be different, but they may also use a different vernacular to refer to the same thing.\nThe passkey registration ceremony -- For any given relying party, you establish one or more passkeys that you're going to use in order to sign in to a website or app.\nThe passkey-based authentication ceremony -- Once a passkey has been enrolled with a relying party, this is how you use it to authenticate with that relying party.\nThe passkey deletion process -- Cleaning up unused or unwanted passkeys.\nAlso: Your password manager is under attack: How to defend yourself against a new threat\nPasskeys depend on standards and hidden complexity\nThe complexity of these workflows matters. Where the public and private keys come into play, they are significantly embellished by two industry standards that, taken together, form the foundation on which passkeys work. One of these standards -- known as WebAuthn -- comes from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is an industry standard for web-based passwordless authentication, passkey or not. In other words, passkeys are WebAuthn-compliant credentials. Much of a passkey's unique value proposition as a more secure credential than a username-password combo is rooted in its compliance with the passwordless WebAuthn standard.\nHowever, as complete as the WebAuthn specification is, the innovation of the passkey required the support of an additional foundational standard from another consortium known as the FIDO Alliance. FIDO stands for Fast ID Online, and the need for that additional standard is largely rooted in the need for passkeys to be a friction-free form of authentication involving little more user interaction than the provision of a PIN or biometric (something that most users are already familiar with).\nAlso: How passkeys work: What really happens during a passwordless login?\nAfter all, we already authenticate to a lot of applications and devices with nothing more than our fingerprint. It stands to reason that we should be able to do the same with any website or app. Moreover, both the process and user experience -- from one relying party to the next -- should be as standard and recognizable as the legacy standard of using usernames and passwords.\nTo meet that need, the FIDO Alliance published an additional specification called the client-to-authenticator protocol (CTAP). Just the phrase \"client to authenticator\" is loaded with some of the complexity that most passkey implementations attempt to hide from users (sometimes not so successfully). As you'll learn in this series, a typical passkey-based authentication -- officially referred to as an \"authentication ceremony\" -- involves a sequence of hand-offs from one entity to another, each one often under the control of a different vendor and each one an opportunity for user confusion or worse, a workflow's failure.\nUnderstanding passkey terminology\nAs CTAP's meaning suggests, in addition to the aforementioned relying party, two other entities are involved in all passkey workflows: the client and the authenticator. The client, in most circumstances, is the piece of technology (i.e., a web browser) in the end-user's device (i.e., computer or smartphone) that handles incoming and outgoing web traffic. As a handler of your system's web traffic, the client is essentially an intermediary between the relying party and the authenticator. It receives inbound WebAuthn-compliant web-based authentication requests from the relying party, passes them on to an authenticator, and then relays the authenticator's response back to the relying party.\nAlso: The best password managers: Expert tested\nIn a WebAuthn and passkey context, an authenticator is a separate piece of technology (also in the user's possession) that's not necessarily the type of authenticator you're likely familiar with -- ones like Google Authenticator or Symantec VIP that are devoted to the generation of one-time passcodes. Authenticators in a WebAuthn and passkey context can handle public key cryptography tasks such as creating public/private key pairs and using a private key to digitally sign or encrypt messages before they are sent to a relying party.\nAuthenticators come in different forms, and, as discussed in my 10 passkey survival tips, deciding which one to use requires a bit of forward thinking and planning. In addition to their role as credential managers that store and synchronize credentials of all types (user ID/passwords, passkeys, etc.) across all of your devices, password managers such as 1Password, Bitwarden, Dashlane, and LastPass can serve in a secondary role as authenticators (the W3C refers to these third-party authenticators as \"virtual authenticators\"). Similarly, the platforms and browsers we use -- such as Windows, MacOS, Chrome, and Firefox -- have their own password management and authenticator capabilities (known as \"platform authenticators\"). And for those who prefer an authenticator in the form of dedicated hardware, you have the option of a roaming authenticator such as one of Yubico's Yubikeys or Google's Titan.\nHow passkeys work\nGiven the variety of choices for both clients and authenticators, a standard like CTAP was required to normalize the integration between them as best as possible.\nPasskeys are, therefore, both a WebAuthn and CTAP-compliant passwordless credential, or what the FIDO Alliance refers to as a FIDO2-compliant credential. As you can see, the lingo alone can be confusing. A passkey is sometimes called a FIDO2 credential and vice versa. You have password managers that are actually credential managers because not every supported credential type (e.g., a passkey) involves a password. But at the same time, they're also referred to as authenticators, and these authenticators are not necessarily the authenticators you're used to working with. But for these authenticators, there are different types -- platform, virtual, and roaming -- but not all of them are credential managers. Meanwhile, most credential managers are authenticators too.\nIs your head spinning yet? Mastering the vocabulary, never mind how to work the technology, is intimidating to say the least.\nOne of the goals of this six-part ZDNET series on how passkeys work is to make passkeys less intimidating. I'm going to cover the four major workflows in detail, demonstrating what users will typically see as they go through each workflow while also revealing the complexity of what's taking place behind the scenes each time the user clicks or taps on a link or button.\nAlso: The best security keys: Expert tested\nSussing out the most important passkey concepts\nWhile it's impossible to achieve this goal without going into some of the gory technical details, this series attempts to strike a balance between a high-level primer and a low-level discussion of every configuration, outcome, and parameter that's available to each of the workflows. As such, I focus on the most important of the passkey concepts and implementations, the ones that make a convincing story about the superiority of passkeys over traditional credentials. In doing so, I will gloss over -- or altogether ignore -- some of the finer points (even though they're important too) while taking certain liberties with the vocabulary.\nFor example, when I say credential manager, I usually mean the password manager performing in its credential manager role. But when I say authenticator, I also mean the password manager, but in its authenticator role. You heard about the client in this introduction to the series, but you won't see that term again. Going forward, I'll go with \"browser\" to make certain points. Even though the phrase \"relying party\" technically refers to the party that's the operator of the sites, apps, and other services that support passkeys, it is frequently used interchangeably with words like \"site\" and \"app\" to keep the reader focused on the four major entities involved in most passkey workflows.\nSpeaking of apps, this series would have been twice as long if I had given specific lip service to the mobile passkey user experiences on iOS and Android. I skipped them because the basic workflows and concepts are the same. However, I plan to revisit the mobile use case in future articles because some mobile app adaptations to passkeys are better than others.\nWith apologies to the people who developed the WebAuthn and CTAP standards, key terminology -- exact field names and conceptually important words like \"nonce\" and \"attestation\" -- are abstracted or bypassed altogether so as not to distract readers from the higher-level concepts being explained.\nFinally, for demonstration purposes, I use the same four technologies across this entire series:\n- Shopify.com for the relying party\n- Google Chrome for the browser\n- Bitwarden's password management extension (for Chrome) for the authenticator/credential manager\n- MacOS for the operating system\nI could have just as easily picked Paypal.com, Firefox, NordPass, and Windows 11. There would have been subtle differences in the user experience, but they would have been mostly immaterial -- one of the reasons why passkeys are a better credential than anything to come before them.\nStay ahead of security news with Tech Today, delivered to your inbox every morning.\nIn the next installment -- Do your favorite sites even support passkeys? -- I use Shopify's website as an example of how to discover if a relying party even supports passkeys -- many do not.\nHow passkeys work: Overview | Discovery | Selection | Registration | Authentication | Deletion"

      "text": "Where the cloud goes from here: 8 trends to follow and what it could all cost\nWhere does the cloud go from here? For many companies, that's a multi-billion-dollar question. One set of answers comes from tech analyst Gartner's latest papers, The Future of Cloud in 2029: The Journey From Technology to Business Necessity and Predicts 2025: Challenges Shaping the Future of Cloud Adoption.\nAt its IT Infrastructure, Operations & Cloud Strategies conference in Sydney, Australia, Gartner also suggested eight key trends for the cloud through 2029: cloud dissatisfaction, AI/machine learning (ML), multicloud, sustainability, digital sovereignty, supercloud, edge computing, and industry-specific solutions.\nAlso: How AI can help you finally demolish your business's mounting technical debt\nIn his keynote speech at the conference, Joe Rogus, Gartner advisory director, said: \"These trends are accelerating the shift in how cloud is transforming from a technology enabler to a business disruptor and necessity for most organizations. Over the next few years, cloud will continue to unlock new business models, competitive advantages, and ways of achieving business missions.\"\nThat's a pretty generic comment. It also strikes me as being behind the times. I've been following the cloud since day one, and I'd say the cloud has been a business disruptor for over a decade.\nJust look, for example, at the 800-pound giant of the cloud: Amazon Web Services (AWS). Only two years after its 2006 founding, ZDNET's Larry Dignan, predicted that Amazon's cloud business would prove far more profitable than its retail offerings. Today, AWS, while providing only about 17% of Amazon's total revenue, is the company's most profitable segment.\nAccording to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) company Spacelift, 96% of all companies are now using the public cloud to carry at least some of their workload. At the same time, the 2024 CDW Cloud Computing Research Report stated that 45% of organizations have already shifted at least half of their applications onto public clouds. Looking ahead, 35% of those remaining said they'll move at least half of those applications to the cloud within three years.\nAlso: Meet the most important AI tool that no one is talking about - but everyone needs\nThe disruption is here, and it's been here for a while now. Just look at Microsoft. Many people think the company makes most of its money from Windows and Office. However, in 2024, 62% of its revenue came from cloud services. Windows accounted for just 10%. That split explains why Microsoft is investing so much money in Linux.\nLet's dig into Gartner's trends and see where that takes us.\n1. Cloud dissatisfaction: A growing challenge\nDespite widespread adoption, many people are unhappy with their clouds, especially their cost. Gartner predicts that by 2028, a quarter of organizations will experience significant dissatisfaction with their cloud investments, often due to unrealistic expectations, suboptimal implementation, or spiraling costs.\nBased on my many conversations with experts at cloud trade shows, I think many, perhaps most, businesses are already unhappy with cloud bills. It's a common complaint.\nAlso: Have a genius business idea? These 2 AI tools can help you turn it into a reality\nAccording to CloudZero's 2024 State of Cloud Cost Intelligence Report, only four in 10 organizations have their cloud costs where they expect them to be. That result means about 60% of organizations find their cloud costs higher than anticipated, with 49% saying costs were \"a little higher than they should be\" and 11% reporting that costs were \"way too high.\"\nIt's telling that Harness, an AI software delivery company, found in its annual survey report, FinOps in Focus 2025, that it expects businesses to waste $44.5 billion on the cloud in 2025. Gartner, by the way, estimates the industry will spend $723.4 billion on the cloud this year. That's a lot of money and a lot of waste.\n2. AI and ML: The new cloud workload\nGuess what? Businesses will spend a lot more on the cloud soon. Gartner and pretty much everyone else predict we'll be building out AI, and that doesn't come cheap. Indeed, Gartner predicts that by 2029, half of all cloud compute resources will be devoted to AI workloads, up from less than 10% today.\nOn the other hand, IDC estimates that by 2025, 75% of businesses will leverage AI-driven cloud services, so Gartner may be underestimating how quickly organizations will swing to cloud-driven AI services. However, another question is whether the money spent on AI cloud will be worth it. I have my doubts.\n3. Multicloud and hybrid strategies: Flexibility over lock-in\nThe days of relying on a single cloud provider are fading. Gartner noted a surge in multicloud adoption, with organizations blending private and public cloud resources to avoid vendor lock-in and optimize for cost, performance, and resilience. By the end of 2025, Gartner expects over 85% of organizations to use hybrid or multicloud strategies.\nAlso: How to use ChatGPT freely without giving up your privacy - with one simple trick\nIndeed, we're already almost there. Most businesses -- even my mini business, Vaughan-Nichols & Associates -- use more than one cloud. A hybrid cloud, by the way, is one where you run workloads across both private (on-premises) and public cloud environments, usually using orchestration tools such as Kubernetes to manage and deploy applications across different infrastructures. A multicloud is just one where you use two or more clouds for services. For example, Microsoft 365 is used for your office software, and Google Drive is used for your personal file storage.\nAccording to Fortinet's 2025 State of Cloud Security Report, more than 78% of organizations already use two or more cloud providers. Statista, the business data company, agrees. In 2024, Statista declared that more than 70% of firms use two or more cloud providers.\n4. Sustainable solutions: The green cloud\nGartner believes the green cloud is no longer a peripheral concern. The analyst highlighted the rise of green cloud initiatives as providers and users face mounting pressure to reduce their environmental impact. Cloud giants like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud are investing in renewable energy and carbon-neutral data centers.\nAlso: 5 ways to turn AI's time-saving magic into your productivity superpower\nHowever, I strongly suspect that what drives this trend is not concern for the environment, but cutting costs. Remember, many cloud customers are not happy with their bills. Green cloud computing can also be cheap cloud computing. As CloudZero, a cloud cost optimizer, observed: \"By optimizing cloud spend, companies can significantly reduce waste, lower energy consumption, and, thus, minimize their carbon emissions.\"\n5. Edge computing and the quantum leap\nIn 2019, Arpit Joshipura, then The Linux Foundation's general manager of networking, told me that \"edge computing will overtake cloud computing\" by 2025. He wasn't right, but he wasn't far wrong either. Edge and cloud computing, as Gartner observed, are merging. They're creating a seamless computational fabric, enabling real-time analytics and IoT applications that demand ultra-low latency.\nOthers have pointed to this blurring, too. Bernard Marr, a well-regarded futurist, recently observed: \"The artificial boundary between edge and cloud computing is disappearing, giving birth to a seamless computational fabric that's reshaping what's possible. Self-driving cars will make split-second decisions locally while leveraging cloud-based intelligence.\"\nAlso: 100 leading AI scientists map route to more 'trustworthy, reliable, secure' AI\nPublic cloud computing continues to be crucial, with spending estimated at $723bn this year. Again, though, as the two blend together, it will be harder to tell the line between edge and cloud.\nMeanwhile, quantum computing is emerging from the lab and entering the cloud, with providers like IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon making quantum capabilities accessible as a service, unlocking new possibilities in fields from drug discovery to cybersecurity. But let's get real. Quantum computing is still a long, long way from being something anyone uses in production. Of course, you could have said that in 2020, too, about AI, and look at us now?\n6. Industry-specific clouds\nGartner also predicts that more and more organizations will turn to industry-specific cloud platforms. The analyst firm projects that by 2029, more than half of all organizations will leverage these specialized cloud solutions to accelerate their business initiatives.\nIndustry cloud platforms offer tailored capabilities designed to address the unique needs of vertical sectors such as healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and retail. Vendors are increasingly rolling out solutions beyond generic cloud services, enabling companies to scale digital initiatives and respond more effectively to industry-specific challenges.\nThis is a case where Gartner, it seems to me, is behind the curve. Many industries are already locked into vertical clouds built solely for their use. For example, if your phone uses 5G from AT&T, Deutsche Telekom, Orange, SK Telecom, Comcast, or Verizon, your data and voice depend on OpenStack clouds behind the scenes.\n7. Digital sovereignty\nIf you're living in the US, chances are you don't even know what digital sovereignty is all about. Outside the US, it's a different story. Many countries, especially in the UK and the EU, don't trust US-based cloud services. They fear, with reason, that their data might not be adequately protected.\nAlso: Why OpenStack and Kata Containers are both seeing a resurgence of adoption\nOur current government hasn't been making friends overseas lately. As Gartner put it, \"Organizations will be increasingly required to protect data, infrastructure, and critical workloads from control by external jurisdictions and foreign government access. Gartner predicts over 50% of multinational organizations will have digital sovereign strategies by 2029, up from less than 10% today.\"\nI think it will happen even faster than that. I spent a month in the UK earlier this year, and everyone in the cloud business talked about this. It's not just across the Atlantic. Late last year, Younghold Han, Hyundai's VP of car cloud, told me that Hyundai chose OpenStack because it gave them the control and security they needed to feel their data was adequately protected.\n8. The rise of supercloud and user-centric design\nWarning: More technical jargon is coming. However, supercloud does at least describe something useful. A supercloud provides a single interface or control plane for managing resources, workloads, and data across all participating clouds. That way, you don't need to learn each cloud's unique front ends and application programming interfaces (API).\nAs you might imagine, this integration isn't easy. Gartner believes it will happen, though. So far, supercloud programs, such as Snowflake Data Cloud, Databricks Lakehouse Platform, and Dell Project Alpine, can deal with parts of the problem for multiclouds, but no one's licked the problem yet.\nLooking ahead\nGartner's outlook, reinforced by industry analysts and market data, paints a picture of a cloud ecosystem that is smarter, greener, and more integral to business success than ever before. As Rogus said, the \"cloud will continue to unlock new business models, competitive advantages, and ways of achieving business missions.\"\nAlso: Why smart businesses use AI to offload tasks and supercharge their teams\nThe organizations that adapt to these trends will be best positioned to thrive in the cloud-driven future. Those that lag will fall behind in an increasingly cloud-tech-centric world.\nGet the biggest stories in tech every Friday with ZDNET's Week in Review newsletter."

      "text": "Why some companies are backing away from the public cloud\nThe cloud has dominated enterprise technology provision for a decade or more. Public cloud services, with huge capacity, commitments to security, and assurances that the latest and greatest technologies are running underneath, offer a compelling value proposition. In the age of artificial intelligence (AI), capacity is critical. However, a new survey suggests evidence of a movement away from public provision.\nClose to seven in 10 companies (69%) have moved at least some apps off the cloud and back to on-premise systems or private clouds, the survey of 1,420 IT executives from Rackspace finds. Reasons given for this retrenchment back to on-premise environments include data security and compliance concerns, cited by 50%, better integration with existing on-premise systems, mentioned by 48%, and cost savings and budget constraints, cited by 44%.\nAlso: The best email hosting services: Expert tested\nIndustry experts and business leaders also recognized a reconsideration of the value of public clouds. For one, the rising costs of cloud subscriptions -- with accompanying sticker shock -- means many finance chiefs have paused for thought. \"Enterprises are just spending too much on public cloud services, given applications they may have migrated to the cloud years ago,\" said David Linthicum, a leading consultant, author, and former CTO with Deloitte.\nTechnical debt may be the root of many moves back to on-premise environments. \"Normally this is a self-inflicted thing,\" Linthicum said. \"They didn't refactor the applications to make them more efficient in running on the public cloud providers. So the public cloud providers, much like if we're pulling too much electricity off the grid, just hit them with huge bills to support the computational and storage needs of those under-optimized applications.\"\nRather than spending more money to optimize or refactor applications, these same enterprises put them back on-premise, said Linthicum. Security and compliance are also an issue. Enterprises \"realize that it's too expensive to remain compliant in the cloud, with data and sovereignty rules. So, they just make a decision to push it back on-premise.\"\nAlso: 5 reasons why Google's Trillium could transform AI and cloud computing - and 2 obstacles\nThe perceived high costs of cloud operations \"often stem from lift-and-shift migrations that in some cases didn't optimize applications for cloud environments,\" said Miha Kralj, global senior partner for hybrid cloud service at IBM Consulting. \"These direct transfers typically maintain existing architectures that don't leverage cloud-native capabilities, resulting in inefficient resource utilization and unexpectedly high expenses.\"\nHowever, the solution to this problem \"isn't necessarily repatriation to on-premises infrastructure,\" said Kralj. \"Most performance, security, and cost challenges we encounter can be addressed through cloud-native refactoring -- redesigning applications to fully utilize cloud capabilities like auto-scaling, containerization, and serverless architectures. Organizations that invest in refactoring consistently report improved operational efficiency and better cost control.\"\nWhen it comes to costs, \"many organizations are finding that cloud solutions can be costly, with unexpected expenses from data egress fees and premium features, among others,\" said Timothy E. Bates, professor at the University of Michigan and former CTO for Lenovo and General Motors. \"On the other hand, on-prem solutions have upfront costs, but they are more cost-effective in the long run for stable workloads.\"\nAlso: The best open-source AI models: All your free-to-use options explained\nBates witnessed the trend toward achieving a better balance between cloud and on-prem while architecting and building hybrid solutions for GM: \"Large enterprises are increasingly reevaluating the risks and limitations of relying solely on the cloud for critical workloads and intellectual property.\"\nEnterprises don't like being dependent upon someone else's cloud infrastructure, said Richard Robbins, founder and owner of TheTechnologyVault.com. \"Many of the enterprises that are regulated, especially banks and other financial institutions, are moving some or all of their web apps from the cloud back to on-prem or to hybrid setups,\" he observed. \"It is clear that there has been enough vulnerability and downsides to cloud hosting to make executives feel nervous about not having more control over the security and other aspects of cloud hosting.\"\nBates also said security, control, and cost efficiency are at the roots of such cloud hesitation: \"A cloud, while offering scalability, is a shared resource -- organizations have to trust third-party providers like Azure, Amazon, or Google with their most sensitive data. For businesses with highly proprietary information or strict compliance needs, the potential risks of not having end-to-end control over the storage of that information far exceed the benefits.\"\nAlso: How to easily use Cloudflare's secure DNS on your Mac and why it even matters\nTo a large degree, the hype around the cloud has dissipated, with many people focusing on AI instead. As a result, many decision-makers are taking a clear-eyed view of the cloud's benefits and drawbacks. \"I remember talking to CIOs and DevOps personnel in 2017 -- several of them had been assigned, to their dismay, to do whatever was needed to move their technology into the cloud,\" said Robbins. \"Most felt overwhelmed with the assignment and pushed back. That was during the cloud rush, when having apps hosted in the cloud was a status symbol and a marketing flex.\"\nNow, \"with the movement to the cloud being hasty and not very well coordinated, enterprises are re-thinking their initial decision to move to the cloud,\" Robbins continued. \"Companies like Dropbox, one of the first major enterprises to use the cloud, began moving back to their own hosting infrastructure as early as 2015. The benefits of their reversal -- including saving nearly $75 million in operational costs over a two-year period -- have influenced other enterprises to follow suit.\"\nBates said reliability and performance are also considerations that favor on-premise systems. He said applications that require low latency, and mission-critical tools or apps that deal with proprietary processes, are sometimes better run from dedicated, in-house infrastructure. \"When we built the hybrid model for GM, we got the benefits of the cloud without compromising on the security and reliability of on-prem systems,\" he said. \"This hybrid model is something that is now being adopted by more companies.\"\nHowever, some experts believe evidence of a movement away from the cloud is unclear, especially when vendor perspectives are involved. \"When we talk about the potential security benefits of local architecture, this is a drop in the bucket compared to larger conversations in cybersecurity at this moment,\" said Seth Geftic, vice president of product marketing at Huntress. \"Although I don't believe that people are moving away from the cloud in such high waves, there are a number of potential reasons that a company could look toward local infrastructure.\"\nA balancing act between on-prem and cloud will likely continue, with the need to weigh the advantages for both sides. \"Cloud providers have a huge deal of control over their resources, meaning that there is little companies can do when they decide to put up prices,\" said Geftic.\n\"Cloud is an expensive solution, but one that offsets that with a number of advantages -- speed, scalability, ease of use. What the industry could experience is a slight deviation from full-cloud architecture and a restructuring toward hybrid environments. A direct leap from fully cloud-based to fully local seems like a slight stretch, if I'm being honest.\""

      "text": "Data-stealing cyberattacks are surging - 7 ways to protect yourself and your business\n2024 delivered some good news and bad news in the area of cybercrime. Malware-based ransomware attacks dropped for the third year in a row. But instances of infostealer malware grew dramatically. Those findings come from IBM X-Force's \"2025 Threat Intelligence Index\" released Thursday.\nFirst, let's look at the good news. For the year, ransomware accounted for just 28% of malware incidents, the third annual decline in a row. This means a decrease in malware distributed in advance of ransomware attacks. At the same time, there was a drop in attacks from many high-volume malware distributors, including Emotet, TrickBot, IcedID, Qakbot, Gozi and Pikabot.\nAlso: Why multi-factor authentication is absolutely essential in 2025\nOf course, ransomware continues to pose a significant threat. Based on an analysis of dark web activity and other factors, IBM X-Force observed a 25% rise in actual attacks last year. Among the most active ransomware families in 2024 were Akira, LockBit, Black Basta, RansomHub, and Hunters International.\nHowever, the ongoing decline in ransomware-associated malware is still a positive trend, one that X-Force attributed to several different factors.\nFirst, several of the high-volume malware distributors have less of a presence or have ceased operations entirely. Second, the combined efforts of many law enforcement agencies worldwide have led to the takedown of botnets that play a role in ransomware attacks. Third, more businesses have refused to pay the ransom, prompting more attackers to find other ways to make a living.\nNow, onto the bad news. Cybercriminals are more apt to steal your sensitive data than hold it for ransom. That led to an 84% weekly rise in infostealers last year over 2023 and an even larger increase of 180% so far in early 2025. By tricking the recipient into clicking a link or opening a file attachment, phishing emails launch infostealer malware that captures sensitive information -- most notably, account credentials.\nAlso: Will using a VPN help protect you from malware or ransomware?\nAlmost one in three infostealer attacks analyzed by X-Force in 2024 resulted in the theft of credentials. Stolen credentials are lucrative to cybercriminals as they can easily buy and sell them on dark web marketplaces. That type of exposure leaves individuals vulnerable to identity theft and puts employers at risk for more devastating types of attacks and compromises.\nIn 2024, the top five infostealers alone appeared in more than 8 million ads on the dark web. Each of those ads contained hundreds of stolen credentials, totaling around 1.6 billion.\nInfostealers can also act as spyware, hiding on an infected PC or device to snoop on your activity and information. Once installed, they can run in the background to snap screenshots, capture your keystrokes, and retrieve your passwords. With infostealers a popular method of attack, many criminal groups use a malware-as-a-service (MaaS) model.\nAlso: That weird CAPTCHA could be a malware trap - here's how to protect yourself\nAs attackers have grown in sophistication, the malware payloads are more cleverly disguised, making it difficult for security tools to detect them. By using advanced infostealers, a cybercriminal can quickly make off with account credentials and other sensitive data without having to maintain a backdoor or an ongoing presence.\n\"Cybercriminals are most often breaking in without breaking anything -- capitalizing on identity gaps overflowing from complex hybrid cloud environments that offer attackers multiple access points,\" said Mark Hughes, global managing partner of Cybersecurity Services at IBM.\n\"Businesses need to shift away from an ad-hoc prevention mindset and focus on proactive measures such as modernizing authentication management, plugging multi-factor authentication holes, and conducting real-time threat hunting to uncover hidden threats before they expose sensitive data.\"\nAlso: How a researcher with no malware-coding skills tricked AI into creating Chrome infostealers\nTo protect your business from infostealers and other types of malware, IBM X-Force offers the following recommendations:\n1. Monitor the dark web. Look for information about your own company, employees, networks, and data to see what attackers know about you.\n2. Train your employees. Educate your employees about phishing attacks, poor password habits, and other risks. Ensure that they know how to protect themselves and your business.\n3. Set up an incident response plan. Make sure all the necessary people in your company know how to respond in the event of a cyberattack or compromise. Keep your incident response plan updated to address the latest threats targeting your industry or business.\n4. Protect your sensitive data. Protect important data, whether on-premises, in the cloud, or in hybrid environments. To do this, use encryption and access controls, and make sure you monitor all data transfers.\n5. Streamline your identity management tools. Identity management tools can control access to critical data but try to reduce the number of disparate and even redundant products. Ideally, you want to streamline them into an \"identity fabric\" approach.\nAlso: Why AI-powered security tools are your secret weapon against tomorrow's attacks\n6. Turn to AI. Cybercriminals use AI to craft successful attacks, so use the same technology to protect your business. With the right AI, you can often detect and respond to threats more quickly.\n7. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA). Set up MFA for all employees and partners who need to access your systems and data.

      "text": "Best remote access software 2025: The top services for remote work and file access\nWhy you can trust ZDNET\n'ZDNET Recommends': What exactly does it mean?\nZDNET's recommendations are based on many hours of testing, research, and comparison shopping. We gather data from the best available sources, including vendor and retailer listings as well as other relevant and independent reviews sites. And we pore over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the products and services we\u2019re assessing.\nWhen you click through from our site to a retailer and buy a product or service, we may earn affiliate commissions. This helps support our work, but does not affect what we cover or how, and it does not affect the price you pay. Neither ZDNET nor the author are compensated for these independent reviews. Indeed, we follow strict guidelines that ensure our editorial content is never influenced by advertisers.\nZDNET's editorial team writes on behalf of you, our reader. Our goal is to deliver the most accurate information and the most knowledgeable advice possible in order to help you make smarter buying decisions on tech gear and a wide array of products and services. Our editors thoroughly review and fact-check every article to ensure that our content meets the highest standards. If we have made an error or published misleading information, we will correct or clarify the article. If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nIf you're working from home, you need the right remote access software to support you. For example, you might need to access company resources and content while working remotely, or remote desktop software could be your best bet to provide customer tech support.\nRemote access software is perfect for quick, remote connections between devices. It forges a remote link between machines, allowing users to control other devices, provide administrative support, and access data and files remotely. The best options will create reliable, secure connections, and preferably for a reasonable price.\nWhat is the best remote access software right now?\nThe best remote access software solution on the market today is Splashtop. This multi-platform option is suitable for individuals and businesses alike and comes with a huge selection of functions and security controls. A trial is available, and plans begin at $5 per month. I would recommend the Pro package for most users at $8.25 per month.\nAlternatively, another fantastic option is Zoho Assist, a consistently affordable solution for remote support and unattended access tasks, with subscriptions beginning for $10 per month on a tech support plan.\nAlso: How to remotely access and control someone else's iPhone (with their permission)\nI have compiled a list of my top recommendations for remote access software based on ZDNET authors' extensive testing, research into customer experiences, and personal use. Read on to explore the rest of my top picks.\nThe best remote access software in 2025\nSplashtop is my top recommendation for remote access software.\nWhy we like it: Splashtop has a vast array of useful features for remote system management. Packaged in a user-friendly interface, you can manage remote teams, file transfers, remote printing, choose remote wake and reboot options, share desktops, set up session security, and more.\nYou will need to jump through a few security hoops, however, when you set up, which is entirely understandable when you consider the type of software this is. For example, you will need to set a strong password, and new devices will receive an authentication link via email.\nAlso: Best password managers for business\nTo set up a basic remote link, you only need to download the Splashtop Manager and click \"Add Computer.\" You will then be provided with a link to the target system that needs to be accessed.\nWho it's for: Considering its user-friendly interface and vast array of features, I consider it suitable for small and large businesses alike, making it one of my top choices for remote access software overall.\nSplashtop provides a trial and a range of subscriptions. When deciding on your plan, you will need to pick between a package for remote desktop and access or remote IT and support. This all depends on the features most important to you. The cheapest option is remote work and access Solo, billed annually at $60, or $5 per month. A remote IT support package, SOS, is available for $22 per month.\nAlso: You need a router-based VPN in 2025. Here's why and how to set one up\nAdd-ons are also available, including endpoint management and screen mirroring software.\nWho should look elsewhere: While some customers note that pricing and subscriptions could be streamlined and made easier to understand, many applaud Splashtop's reliable and solid service. It's one of the best remote access services out there, but if you need a free plan beyond a limited trial, you will need to look elsewhere.\nSplashtop features: User-friendly | Remote recording | Unattended setups | Drag-and drop file transfers | Printing | 2FA | Multi-platform | Click-and-drag file management | Free trial available\nZoho Assist is a great remote access software solution if you want an affordable option with cheap plans.\nWhy we like it: It's very easy to initially set up, requiring little more than your credentials and a verification email.\nZoho's dashboard contains a wealth of helpful information and graphics, allowing users to track their monitoring sessions and manage data privacy. Different tabs organize options for user groups, customers, and contacts, unattended access, security, and compliance.\nFurthermore, the platform can be integrated with many third-party apps including Slack, Zendesk, Jira, and Freshdesk, which will be helpful for technical support professionals.\nAlso: Best free software uninstallers & best antivirus\nHowever, in my opinion, the user interface is cluttered and could use streamlining, so it might take a while to become familiar with the layout.\nWho it's for: Customers looking for affordable remote access software suitable for use with third-party apps.\nYou can take advantage of Zoho Assist's free trial before committing to a plan, and you don't need to provide payment card details. Pricing is easy to understand and begins at $10 per month for technical support uses or the same price for unattended access purposes. Professional and enterprise plans are available.\nWho should look elsewhere: Customer feedback indicates that many are happy with the price point, but there are reports that indicate support needs improvement. If you think you might need rapid, ongoing support, this may not be the right solution.\nZoho Assist features: Useful session metrics | Unattended access | File transfers | Voice chat | Mobile device support | Slack, Jira, Zendesk integration | Advanced security settings | MFA | 15-day free trial\nRemotePC HelpDesk is one of RemotePC's offerings best suited to helpdesk operations.\nWhy we like it: The software's user interface is clean and uncluttered, and the HelpDesk bolt-on to the standard RemotePC service can be accessed via a browser or a desktop application. You can navigate between technician and group lists, contacts, session histories, remote access tools, and invite or schedule customers for assistance.\nRemotePC is an affordable option with especially cheap plans for new customers. In total, five plans are available, ranging from an individual consumer license to enterprise subscriptions, with the cheapest being $22.12 for the first year for one licensed device.\nAlso: Best VPN free trial 2025\nIf you want HelpDesk, you will pay $9.95 for the first year, although this will jump after the promotional period ends. A free seven-day trial is also available for both setups.\nWho it's for: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux, RemotePC HelpDesk should be on your radar if you're looking for a solution suitable for helpdesk purposes.\nWho should look elsewhere: User reviews are a mixed bag, with some saying that while the software is relatively good, there are issues with connections and customer support, which may not make it the right choice for unattended access or anyone who feels they will need ongoing support.\nRemotePC HelpDesk features: Web access | Remote chat, mic | Screen sharing | File transfers, printing | Always-on remote access | Windows, macOS, Linux compatible | Free trial\nAnyDesk is a well-known brand in the remote desktop software space, although its use might now be limited to specific cases.\nWhy we like it: This is a fair solution for unattended access purposes.\nFeatures of this lightweight client include remote device management, single sign-on (SSO) and two-factor authentication (2FA), identity and access management (IAM), session logging, screen recording, chat, and a collaborative whiteboard feature. You can also customize the remote desktop software client with your own branding.\nAlso: Best antivirus for Android & best antivirus for Windows\nIt is compatible with most popular platforms, including Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and Linux.\nWho it's for: This solution is best suited for small businesses or those looking for a solution focused on unattended access.\nWho should look elsewhere: You should look elsewhere if monthly pricing is of concern.\nThis service is expensive. Plans begin at $22.90 per month on an individual subscription with support for three login devices. However, the basic plan does include mobile support, TCP tunneling, and an upper limit of 100 unattended devices.\nMany customers are happy with the software, but price increases and reports of increasing service restrictions are unpopular.\nWatch out if you receive unexpected security audit requests, as cybercriminals are weaponizing the software in a fresh wave of remote access scams.\nAnyDesk features: Desktop sharing | Client customization | Multi-platform | Unattended access | Mobile device support | Group policies | Free trial\nTeamViewer should be on your radar if you need a free solution for casual, personal use.\nWhy we like it: I use TeamViewer to assist an elderly relative on a fairly frequent basis, and I have no complaints about its free version.\nSure, it's a bit dated, it's not the fastest solution out there, and it doesn't have all of the advanced features of competing companies -- still, it fills a need in the market for individuals who need reliable remote desktop software for occasional use.\nAlso: Fastest VPNs 2025\nAlternatively, business plans are available for multiple concurrent connections, unattended devices, phone support in 33 languages, and integration add-ons including an AI-based session insight generator. It is also possible to integrate TeamViewer with services including ServiceNow, Freshworks, Zendesk, and Jamf.\nWho it's for: Many long-term customers say that the software simply works and comes in handy for casual remote activities, although some note that it can be slow to connect.\nWho should look elsewhere: While TeamViewer has business plans available, if you need advanced features, you may want to check out my other recommendations.\nTeamViewer features: User-friendly UI | Multi-platform | Session sharing codes | Remote scripting | Business plans available | Mobile support | AI insights | Free version\nWhat is the best remote access software?\nRemote access software | Price | Best for individual/business use? | Mobile-friendly? | 2FA/MFA/SSO? | Free trial? |\nSplashtop | $5 per month ($60 annually)+ | Both | Yes | Yes | Yes |\nZoho Assist | $10 per month+ | Business | Yes | Yes | Yes |\nRemotePC, HelpDesk | $9.95 per year+ | Both | x | Yes | Yes |\nAnyDesk | $22.90 per month+ | Business | Yes | Yes | Yes |\nTeamViewer | Free or $24.90 per month+ | Individual | Reasonably | Yes | Free version |\nWhich is the right remote access software for you?\nChoose this remote desktop software\u2026 | If you want\u2026 |\nSplashtop | The best remote desktop software overall. Splashtop is a one-size-fits-most solution with multi-platform support and a range of security and pricing options. Whether you need to provide tech support or to access your work machine remotely, there's a plan here for you. |\nZoho Assist | An affordable solution for remote assistance or unattended access. Zoho Assist is best suited for business use, unless you are a solo technician and two concurrent sessions are enough. This cloud option gives you access to remote devices on demand. |\nRemotePC | A solution with a useful HelpDesk extension. If you need a clean, helpful user interface for remote assistance purposes, RemotePC might be for you. It's fast and offers mobile support. |\nAnyDesk | A service suitable for small businesses. It's expensive, but the features on offer for business users might be appealing, especially regarding unattended access options. Cloud or on-premise setups are available. |\nTeamViewer | The best free remote desktop software for individual use. Sure, it doesn't have all of the advanced features of its competitors, but for casual users, TeamViewer has everything you need. |\nWhat is remote access software and why do I need it?\nRemote access software enables you to remotely control another machine, access files, and perform tasks without requiring physical access to a device such as a PC.\nTypically, most remote access software solutions are enabled through the cloud, although they can also be utilized in local area networks. Businesses will often adopt a remote access solution when not everyone is in office, or they want to allow employees to access corporate networks and resources while they are working in the field. Consumers such as I also use remote access software to help out family members.\nFactors to consider when choosing remote access software\nChoosing the right remote access and desktop software, especially if you plan to use it for work and productivity purposes, can be a tough decision. Consider the factors below to make the best choice for you.\n- Security and safety: Your security and safety must be paramount when you are deciding on remote desktop software. If you choose a solution from an unknown or untrustworthy provider, you could end up accidentally compromising your machine and data or installing malware instead.\n- Purpose: What do you need remote access software for? Occasionally helping out an elderly relative or full-time work and tech support? Consider the reasons and choose the right software to suit you.\n- User interface: Ensure you choose a solution with a user interface that appeals to you. A simple, clean look or a more detailed interface displaying all manner of functions -- it's your choice.\n- Third-party integrations: If you want to integrate your remote access software solution with third-party software such as Slack, take note of whether or not such compatibility is available. This might end up saving you frustration and annoyance further down the line.\n- Free versions: Do you want a free option? Research the limits and strings attached. If you're only looking to use remote access software casually, a free solution might be enough, but if you are looking to launch or run a business with a remote access component, you will need to go beyond free options.\n- Cost: If you're happy to pay for remote desktop software, consider how much and when. Keep in mind that prices may increase after your first year as a new customer, and if you opt for monthly subscriptions, you will pay more than you would otherwise on annual, upfront plans.\nHow did I choose these remote access software solutions?\nIn compiling my recommendations for the best remote access software solutions, I researched and examined third-party reviews and opinions from security experts. I also considered the ZDNET team's hands-on experience and knowledge of the security risks associated with some solutions.\nWhen selecting the best remote access software solutions, these are some of the most critical factors that determine the best options for consumers and businesses:\n- Paid, free options: While paid plans are generally better for businesses, I have investigated free and paid plans to suit as many users as possible.\n- Security: Security is extremely important when you are looking for a new remote access software solution. I only included vendors with a clean track record and a reasonably transparent approach to security and patch updates.\n- Rapid file transfers: File transfers are commonly performed through remote access software, so I ensured our recommendations are known for seamless, quick file exchanges.\n- Multi-platform: I have included a range of options suitable for desktop, mobile, and browser-based use. It's important that remote desktop software is flexible.\n- Third-party integrations: To boost productivity, I like to see a range of third-party integrations offered to subscribers.\n- Advanced features: I like to see features on offer beyond a connection from machine to machine. Voice or text chat options, for example, can be extremely useful if you're using remote access software for tech support.\n- Customer feedback: It's crucial that customers, overall, have a good experience with a remote access solution. While I understand that sometimes errors or security issues occur, I focused on vendors with long-standing reputations and positive customer reviews.\n- Customer support: Where possible, I prefer that remote access software providers operate multiple channels and means for customers to receive support.\nLatest news in remote access software\n- CISA has revealed that cybercriminals have exploited unpatched SimpleHelp Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) software vulnerabilities to steal customer data.\n- Google's threat research team has exposed the activities of a group recorded as UNC6148, which is targeting fully patched end-of-life SonicWall Secure Mobile Access (SMA) 100 series appliances.\nRemote Access Software FAQs\nIs remote access software safe to use?\nGenerally, yes, but only if proper security controls and measures are taken. Remote access software should be disabled when it is not in use, and you should always opt for a provider known for taking the security of its users and customers seriously, with frequent patch updates and audits. You should also consider using a VPN with remote access software for an additional layer of security.\nDo I need technical knowledge to use remote access software?\nNo, it is far easier to use remote access software than you may think. TeamViewer, for example, only requires a download, installation, and then the exchange of keys or permissions to forge a connection between two systems. Legitimate tech support teams will often use remote access software to resolve problems, and it takes no more than a few minutes to launch and enable.\nIs remote access software compatible with VPNs?\nYes. In fact, sometimes you may be required to use a VPN with remote access software, such as when you are trying to access resources or systems belonging to your employer. You may also be required to use a VPN to change your location prior to launching this software. While remote access software builds the bridge between two devices, VPNs utilize encryption to create a more secure tunnel.\nAlso: Best travel VPNs 2025\nWhy should I disable remote access software when not in use?\nYou should not leave remote access software open and running when not in use. While our recommendations are all trustworthy and secure, it is simply a good security practice to keep apps and software that permit remote access closed when you do not need them.\nCan you tell if someone is remotely accessing your computer?\nNot always, but there can be telltale signs. For example, if you suspect someone is tampering with your machine while you're sitting there, you may notice unexpected mouse or pointer movements, files opening and closing, or command prompts. If you suspect your PC is compromised, cut off its internet access immediately.\nDo cybercriminals use remote access software?\nUnfortunately, yes. Remote access software provides quick access to another machine, and cybercriminals are known for abusing these services in their scams.\nFor example, scammers tell their victims their PC is compromised with a virus and then lure their target into downloading a remote desktop solution so they can \"fix\" their machines for them. There are also plenty of Trojans and other forms of malware out there that include remote access modules.\nAlso: The best free VPNs: Expert tested\nYou should never give remote access software details or access to anyone you don't personally know and trust -- and never to a cold caller.\nAlternative remote access software to consider\nLatest updates\n- In ZDNET's July update, we performed various editorial updates and changes.\n- In ZDNET's May update, we made guide layout changes and updated our top picks with the latest news and pricing."
