  "content": "ROAD TOWN, British Virgin Islands, Aug. 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LYNO AI is attracting serious investor attention since its early bird presale progress is gaining momentum. With over 265,000 tokens already sold in the total allocation of 16 million tokens, the sale is already proving to be very strong in demand in the market. Investors are rushing to buy their tokens as the presale price is at the moment only 0.050 dollars per token and this phase is about to end.\n\nToken price will rise on the next presale to 0.055, and this helps build a sense of urgency and encourage buyers to act now. Such price change indicates the development trend of LYNO AI and the rising level of value expectation of the project. The current stage is a strategic purchasing during which the early entrants have the advantage of a low entry price that will subsequently increase at the planned time.\n\nTo make this even more appealing, LYNO AI is organizing a giveaway, which is available only to those who purchase their tokens during the presale, and where they have a chance to win 100K. This initiative is another extra incentive and shows that LYNO AI will not leave the first supporters unrewarded. These promotions increase the value proposition of the whole package in a presale program.\n\nInvestors should take advantage of the early bird presale of LYNO AI before the end of the presale. Already having sold over 250,000 tokens prematurely, this momentum is expected to be a possible explosion as the presale reaches its end. Individuals who would like to use the current price and the giveaway opportunity must hurry in order to take advantage before it is too late.\n\nThe LYNO AI presale is audited by Cyberscope, which guarantees the transparency and trustworthiness of its activities. This enhances the investors in this stage with additional confidence.\n\nIn conclusion, LYNO AI is an appealing presale that is attracting a lot of investor attention, there is an imminent increase in the price of the token, and this presale offers excellent incentives. Now is the moment to act quickly and place your order for tokens before the price increases as anticipated.\n\nFor more information about LYNO visit the links below:\n\nDisclaimer: This content is provided by LYNO AI.
