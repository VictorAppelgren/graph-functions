  "content": "Did you know you can customize Google to filter out garbage? Take these steps for better search results, including adding Lifehacker as a preferred source for tech news.\n\nFor anyone tired of juggling a vacuum, mop, and a schedule, the is worth a look. It\u2019s currently down to $699 on Amazon (regularly $1,049.99), marking its lowest price to date, according to . This is one of those do-it-all robots that doesn\u2019t just vacuum\u2014it also mops, washes its own pads, and empties its own dustbin. That\u2019s the appeal: less daily fuss, more set-it-and-forget-it cleaning. You\u2019ll still need to refill water and empty the dirty tank, but the day-to-day maintenance is cut down dramatically compared to most standalone .\n\nPerformance-wise, the is a step up from other Ecovacs models like the , thanks to its 12,800Pa suction power. In practice, that means it picks up pet hair and heavier debris more reliably. Plus, at less than four inches in height, it is compact enough to slide under couches and beds, something bulkier bots can\u2019t manage. Ecovacs also added TruEdge Adaptive Edge Mopping to , where a hovering mop arm extends out to hug baseboards and corners more tightly. It isn\u2019t flawless (corners remain tricky), but it does better than the typical mop plate stuck to the bottom of a robot.\n\nNavigation is another strong point. The robot builds a detailed map and can avoid most obstacles, though cables and stray paper still trip it up. Ecovacs also gave it a voice assistant called YIKO that responds to more natural commands, so you can tell it to clean a specific room or adjust a run without pulling up the app. The app itself could reportedly use a bit of polish (it sometimes feels buggy), but it\u2019s still serviceable. If you want something more premium, the sits higher in the lineup with more refined features. But for the price, the finds a nice balance between performance and convenience. For a busy household or someone who just doesn\u2019t want to add \u201cvacuuming\u201d to the weekly list, it can feel like .",

      "text": "If you\u2019ve ever felt like you were duped by overpaying for something that was advertised as a \u201cgreat deal,\u201d you\u2019re in the right place. It\u2019s easy to get caught up in frenzied online shopping holidays like the upcoming Prime Day sale, with competition from Best Buy, Target, and Walmart\u2014 especially when these retailers sometimes sneak price hikes before major \u201csales\u201d or deceive shoppers with tricks to spend more than you intended to.\nFiguring out the best time to buy something requires constant watch over ever-fluctuating online prices and some knowledge of how prices have changed in the past. As a shopping and deals writer, that is what I do for a living, and I know how time-consuming it can be. Luckily, you don\u2019t have to figure it all out yourself: Here are the best websites and extensions I've been using for years to check price history and track prices so that you can be sure you\u2019re getting the best deal possible.\nThe best Amazon price tracker: Camelcamelcamel\nCamelCamelCamel is among the best ways to track prices on Amazon products. You can install the browser extension (on Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Opera, and Safari) to get access to the site\u2019s features without leaving Amazon, or you can just copy and paste an Amazon link or product name to the website\u2019s search bar. CamelCamelCamel shows you how the price of the item has gone up or down over time, how prices have changed through Amazon directly, and the fluctuations from third-party Amazon sellers who list new and used items.\nIf you sign up for a free account, you can set up alerts so the site can notify you by email when the price of an item drops below a certain amount, if you can get it used for a given price, or if it\u2019s at an all-time low and now is a good time to buy. You can even see previous historic highs and lows and try to map out the best time to strike.\nThe best price tracker for most online retailers and to compare prices: Honey\nYou've probably already heard of the \"Honey influencer scam\" that blew up in December of 2024. Essentially, Honey hijacked affiliate links from influencers who were sponsoring them. Also, in many instances, it deliberately chose not to give the best coupons to users who used the extension (going completely against its business model). Honey is not alone in this behavior. Many coupon aggregator companies hijack affiliate links; Honey just happens to be in the spotlight because it's the biggest one. Use your own judgment if you choose to use any of its services.\nThe bad news for those looking for a price-tracking tool that can be used for most online retailers is that Honey is the only option. The good news is that Honey's price-tracking tool can't scam you or give you subpar coupons. The Honey browser extension compares prices from a whole bunch of retailers, not just Amazon. You can create a Droplist, which notifies you if the prices drop for an item on your list if you\u2019re willing to wait for a deal. Here is what creating a Droplist can do for you:\nFirst, it\u2019ll keep the items you want to keep tabs on organized and easily accessible. Second, it\u2019ll track the prices of those products and alert you when they go on sale at any major retailer. You can see how much those prices cost leading up to the sale to see if they are, in fact, good deals or a trick from retailers to take advantage of you, and even compare them with other major retailers to see who has the best deal. You can see how to set up your droplist here.\nAs long as you don't buy the products using a Honey link, you won't be giving money to the service. You can still use their tool to your advantage without giving them any of the affiliate revenue. Until there's a better alternative, Honey is the only option that can instantly pull up price histories and track prices for multiple retailers with a browser extension (for now).\nThe best tool to compare prices: Capital One Shopping\nCapital One Shopping, previously known as Wikibuy, compares prices from other sellers when you shop on Amazon. The browser extension will notify you if a product you are looking at is cheaper somewhere else, and offers a summary of pricing history, estimated delivery time, and total price, including tax and shipping. If you can apply a coupon, it\u2019ll add that as well. When the price drops for a product you\u2019ve viewed, Capital One Shopping will notify you. When you shop, you can earn credits for your purchases at some websites, like Walmart and eBay, that Capital One Shopping has partnered with. You can trade that credit for gift cards or put it toward purchases through Capital One Shopping\u2019s site.\nThe extension is available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari, and an iOS app allows you to scan barcodes and search products to do price comparisons from your phone.\nThe best price tracker tool for gamers: CheapShark\nWhile most of the others in the roundup focus on products like electronics, apparel, household goods, and appliances, CheapShark is a great option for those looking to save money on video games. CheapShark combines all of the great places to get discounts on games in one place, one easily searchable directory and database of current prices from sites including Steam, GoG, Green Man Gaming, GameStop, Amazon, and more. Of course, it\u2019s limited to video games, but you can search a game name not just to see how much it\u2019ll cost you to buy, but even if you can buy it at all\u2014and which retailer has it available. If you want, you can even filter by games currently on sale at their selected stores.\nWhen you search for a specific game, CheapShark tells you what the cheapest-ever price was, when it hit that price, and gives you the choice to either go ahead and buy it from your choice of retailer or to sign up for a price notification if it drops again.\nHonorable mentions\nKeepa: Practical price-tracking tool for Amazon and eBay\nKeepa works very similarly to Camelcamelcamel, but instead of clicking on the extension to see the price history, it'll be automatically displayed below the image of the product. This helps if clicking on the extension or installing is one click too much for you. Keepa also lets you track specific products and sends you notifications when they go below a specific price that you set. It also works on eBay. You can download the extension for Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Edge, and Safari.\nSlickDeals: Great for finding deals and checking prices\nSlickDeals is known for bringing you up-to-the-minute discounts, coupons, and other deals from around the web, but its web-based price tracker is also great for watching prices on just about any item on Amazon and on a ton of other popular shopping sites, like Newegg, Gamestop, Chewy, Home Depot, and others.\nThe service doesn\u2019t give you a detailed price history like some of the others in the roundup\u2014it only shows a \u201cdeal history\u201d under the \u201cprice intelligence\u201d section for a few popular products. However, it will track the price of your item from when you create an alert and send you an email if the price drops below a threshold that you set. You can also return to the price tracker at any time, log in to your account, and see all of your tracked items on the same screen."

      "text": "For the last year, I've had three robot vacuums working in various parts of my home. I've put them through the paces in a real-world environment, full of furniture, thresholds, uneven flooring, and one Doberman determined to bring the outdoors in. I've tested robots from every major brand, from Roomba to Roborock, and there are lots of little differences to help you choose if one feature really matters to you. Generally, a few robots stand above the rest, but in some cases, the specific setup of your home may help guide you to one vacuum or another.\nThese days, a robot vacuum that just vacuums is a pretty low bar to meet. The current class of bots all come with self-emptying docks and mopping abilities. In some cases, they can fetch and dispose of their own water.\nEvery robot claims to be quiet (they're not) and anti-tangle (inevitably untrue), so set your expectations appropriately. While a robot zipping around the room isn't likely to bother you, you're not going to Zoom while it's running. While most robots now handle things like long hair with much more dignity, eventually you're going to leave some yarn around, and your robot vacuum will absolutely find that screw you dropped somewhere last year, and all of those issues will require you to flip the bot over and clear it.\nWhen people are trying to decide which vacuum to choose, there are plenty of sources to go to, and I admit, I often feel a sense of satisfaction when all of us agree on the same models. More often, we disagree, which is proof that different test environments influence the outcome. In my case, I've set up each robot following directions and then left them to work in my own home. There aren't fake obstacle courses\u2014just the detritus that falls on the floor of my kitchen while I cook, and the short dog hair that perpetuates the floor, and random puffs of pet-toy floof. Here's what I've thought of the robots I've tested in the last year."

      "url": "https://lifehacker.com/tech/you-can-now-tell-google-which-websites-you-prefer-search-results",
      "text": "Search ain't what it used to be. In the not-so-distant past, your query would return a simple list of links, which you could peruse at your convenience. Now, a search can yield a myriad of result types, from AI summaries to obnoxious or even malicious ads, with the links buried in between. There are ways to make search more useful, but they aren't always obvious.\nThat's why I'm curious about Google's latest search addition. Last week, Google announced that its feature, Preferred Sources, is rolling out to all English users in the U.S. and India. If you frequently test features with Google Labs, you might remember trying this one out: Preferred Sources, as the name implies, lets you tell Google which websites you prefer to read news from. The goal, then, is to see pages from those sites in future Google searches about news stories, assuming those sites publish content related to your search.\nHow to choose your preferred news sources in Google search\nHere's how it works: When you search for something covered in the news, Google will display a \"Top stories\" section at the top of the search results page. While you can simply browse the stories that Google curates for you, you can also now click a new button to the right of the \"Top stories\" title. From here, you can search for any website, and click a checkbox next to its name to save it to your list of preferred sources. Google doesn't put a cap on the number of sources you can add, so you can fill your list with as many sites as you want. You'll also see any sources you previously saved here (including during the Labs experiment period) and you can uncheck them as you wish.\nNow, you can refresh your search results, which, with any luck, will populate with more of the sources you added to this list. Not only will they appear more frequently in the \"Top stories\" section going forward, Google may offer you a new \"From your sources\" section as well, which should only contain the websites you've added to your list. As this feature saves your preferences, you do need to be signed into your Google Account, though it seems to work across a variety of browsers. (Safari and Firefox both worked fine for me.)\nIt's not necessarily groundbreaking, but I do see the utility here. Any chance you get to personalize your search experience is probably worth taking advantage of, and with Preferred Sources, you can (and should) improve the odds the websites you know and trust appear alongside any given news story. It's also an interesting juxtaposition alongside other changes to Google Search, such as Web Guide, an AI-powered Search experience that automatically groups links into different categories.\nIt can be difficult to find high-quality information on the web these days, but I have to say, between these two features, Google is making some decent changes here."

      "text": "Right before the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January, I noticed a trend in robot vacuums. The suction power these robots were reporting were astronomical. Where Pa (suction power is measured in pascals) in 2024 was considered \u201chigh\u201d at 8,000 or 10,000, the Ecovacs x8 is 18,000, the Dreame x50 is 20,000, and the Roborock Saros 10 is 22,000. In calls with the marketing reps and engineers of these machines I would routinely ask, \u201cIs there a limit to how much suction is realistically useful?\u201d And on more than one occasion, engineers revealed that the reason Pa levels had gone sky high was primarily because internal studies had revealed suction power was the primary way consumers chose robot vacuums. While I disagree that suction power translates to a good vacuum, I understand why consumers use this basis to choose: What other criteria would be important?\nSuction is only one factor in getting debris off the floor\nTo understand why suction power isn\u2019t a good determining criteria, you first have to understand how robot vacuums function. Regardless of brand, almost all robots work like a regular vacuum does. On the bottom of the robot are a roller or series of rollers, like a regular vacuum. As the rollers go over debris, the suction from the robot pulls the debris off the rollers and sucks the debris into an internal, bagless chamber. To move debris toward these rollers, most robots have brushes that sweep the debris. In a perfect situation, all debris is picked up by the rollers, suctioned off of them into the chamber, and the floor is left clean.\nThe reality is that certain types of debris, such as hair, tie up the rollers, which wraps around the roller and can slice the silicone on it. Larger debris, like a receipt or even a small piece of mulch can get stuck in the roller, requiring a human to dislodge it. Debris can also be sucked up but clog the pipe because it gets stuck on the way to the internal chamber. In some of these cases, more suction might help, but how straight a suction tube is designed, or even how big the flapper is on the internal chamber make a difference, too. In truth, the entire design of the system, and all the parts working in concert is what makes a robot vacuum successful (or not).\nFor instance, while recently testing the Eureka J15, which has over 16,000Pa, I noticed that even though the sweepers were moving debris directly towards the rollers, the debris wasn\u2019t making it up into the roller, so the robot left the debris behind. The Dyson 360 Vis Nav, which has over 20,000Pa, rides so low to the ground that some debris can\u2019t get to the rollers to be affected by the suction and is instead simply pushed around the floor by the robot. Meanwhile, the original Switchbot K10+ had only 3,000Pa and did a spectacular job grabbing debris off the floor because it rides a little higher, allowing the rollers to access more debris, and the rollers are designed so that debris doesn\u2019t get stuck as often. My favorite robot vacuum and mop of all time, the Roborock MaxV Ultra Vacuum, has only 10,000Pa but is undeterred by any type of debris and gets floors cleaner than any other vacuum I\u2019ve tried. Roborocks have a very effective roller design that doesn\u2019t seem to suffer from getting beat up by debris, and their sweepers are always being redesigned to be more effective at sweeping debris toward the rollers.\nNavigation, AI and the robots size matter, too\nIt\u2019s not only the rollers, sweeper, and suction that determines how well it will suction debris off the floor\u2014the robot also has to be able to access the space where the debris is. Robots are now getting slimmer so they can slide under more furniture, but they\u2019re generally still 12-13 inch objects trying to squeeze themselves into spaces, and if you have a lot of floor furniture, the robot will have trouble getting between those objects to effectively clean. Robots do best in big, open spaces, with walls that have no toekicks. The AI on board most robots can sometimes identify debris as obstacles, and tell the robot to avoid the debris altogether. (This is a repercussion of a few robot vacuums accidentally rolling over pet waste years ago and smearing it all over a room; now, robots are overly cautious about anything that could be remotely interpreted as such by AI).\nDebris also has to move through the dock\nThere\u2019s another point where suction matters, though most product listings don\u2019t discuss it: the robot dock. This is where, in most cases these days, the robot will be auto-emptied into a real vacuum bag that has to be changed every few months. The value of the auto empty is infinite; it\u2019s what makes robot vacuums autonomous. If the dock gets clogged, it\u2019s a lot more work to solve than if the robot does. Recently, I\u2019ve seen mentions of docks like the Narwal Freo Z getting redesigned so there\u2019s less turns in the suction pipe that receives the debris in the dock, since that will translate to less clogs.\nUltimately, there likely isn\u2019t one \u201cbest\u201d robot vacuum, but rather the best robot vacuum for your home, since each house is different. For example, if you have a lot of large debris in your home, you would likely want a Roborock, since they handle that type of debris better than most. If your house has a lot of obstacles, you might consider the Switchbot K10+ Pro, which is much smaller than most robots, and can navigate into smaller spaces. If you have high thresholds in your home, a robot that can navigate those thresholds, like the Dreame x50 or the Roborock Saros line would be important. While suction is a factor of robot success, it shouldn\u2019t be the only or determining factor when making a buying decision."
