Reporting mistakes helps us improve the experience. Generate Key Takeaways\n\nPrison officials at the Idaho Maximum Security Institution have addressed reports about Bryan Kohberger being taunted by inmates.\n\nA spokesperson revealed that officials were \"aware\" but assured the public that the convicted murderer is \"safe\" from harm as he serves his four consecutive life sentences for the murders of four Idaho university students.\n\nBryan Kohberger currently resides in solitary confinement in the restricted unit in the Block J section of the facility.\n\nBarely weeks into his four consecutive life sentences, news emerged that Bryan Kohberger had been subjected to a taunting campaign by inmates.\n\nAccording to earlier reports, these inmates were well aware that the convicted murderer was coming and had made plans to torment him.\n\nUpon his arrival, they took turns making noises into the vents that connect to his cell, and the former PhD student has complained about the harassment, saying it is causing him to lose sleep.\n\nNow, NewsNation, the outlet that previously reported the situation, has confirmed that prison officials are aware of the ongoing incident.\n\n\"We are aware of Kohberger's complaints about what he considers taunting,\" the Idaho Department of Corrections said in a statement.\n\nHowever, they seemingly dismissed the situation as trivial while guaranteeing that the convicted murderer is safe within the facility.\n\n\"Incarcerated individuals commonly communicate with each other in prison,\" the statement continued. \"Bryan Kohberger is housed alone in a cell, and IDOC security staff maintain a safe and orderly environment for all individuals in our custody.\"\n\nPrison Officials Unlikely To Intervene As Bryan Kohberger Faces No Physical Harm\n\nChris McDonough, a former homicide detective who spoke with the outlet about Kohberger's situation, previously suggested that it was unlikely prison officials would intervene in any way.\n\n\"It's really a prison within a prison,\" McDonough said about the IMSI.\n\nHe continued, \"The guards, the most they can do is write it down or tell him, 'Hey, there's nothing we can do. You're not in physical harm.'\n\nThe ex-detective also described Kohberger's prison housing as an \"isolation situation\" that prevents those around him from getting to him physically.\n\nThe Idaho Killer Is Housed In A Restricted Unit At The Institution\n\nAt the moment, the former PHD student is housed in the restricted unit in the Block J section of the facility.\n\nAs such, Kohberger is safe from any inmates who might want to harm him just to make a name for themselves amid the spotlight being on him for the Idaho murders.\n\nHowever, it is believed that with time, Kohberger might be moved to the general section of the facility.\n\nNewsNation offered a glimpse into the facility where Bryan Kohberger is serving out his sentence.\n\nImages obtained by the outlet confirmed that the facility is surrounded by tall barbed-wire iron walls in addition to other extensive security measures.\n\nOn the inside, inmates' cells contain only a bed and a toilet, with each enclosure secured by a thick steel gate and marked with a number.\n\nOutside the cells are tables with chairs spaced several feet apart, where inmates can sit. However, when these facilities are in use, the inmates are chained to the tables.\n\nAlternatively, less violent inmates can spend the one hour they are allowed outside of their cell in a courtyard surrounded by a tall cement wall.\n\nAs for the more violent inmates, they are also allowed outside of their cells but are kept in a cage.\n\nAll feeding is done within the cells, with food passed through the slots in the doors. Meanwhile, showers are allowed every other day.\n\nMore Records From The Murder Case May Emerge In The Coming Days\n\nIn the wake of Kohberger's sentencing, a flurry of information has surfaced about the case.\n\nMany of these details have helped piece together Kohberger's actions before and after the murders, as well as provide deeper insight into his life.\n\nBut beyond these recent revelations, it is possible that more previously sealed records could be unsealed in the coming days, per the New York Post.\n\nOn August 5, Judge Steven Hippler, who presided over the case, revealed he was initiating the lengthy unsealing process.\n\nHe explained that he intended to begin with a batch of 43 items, reviewing them from the newest to the oldest.\n\nAt that time, he also gave prosecutors and the defense two weeks to advocate on whether the reports should be revealed or remain sealed.",
