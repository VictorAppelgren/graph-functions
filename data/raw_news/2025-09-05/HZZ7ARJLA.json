  "title": "Galaxy Watches and Pixel 10 phones are currently incompatible",
  "description": "We can confirm what countless Pixel 10 owners are reporting. The phones are refusing to pair with Samsung's watches.",
  "content": "If you just picked up a shiny new Pixel 10 series phone and tried pairing it with your Galaxy Watch, chances are you\u2019re running into some connectivity trouble. Reports are piling up across Reddit and Google\u2019s support forums that Samsung\u2019s watches, especially the Galaxy Watch 8 series, Galaxy Watch 7 series, and Galaxy Watch Ultra, simply refuse to connect to Google\u2019s flagships over Bluetooth, and we can confirm the issue is very real.\n\nOn our end, a Galaxy Watch 8 Classic wouldn\u2019t pair at all with the Pixel 10 Pro XL. The setup stops dead at the pairing code stage, whether through the Galaxy Wearable app or manual Bluetooth settings. Resetting the watch and reinstalling Samsung Health as well as the Galaxy Wearable app didn\u2019t help either. We also didn\u2019t have any luck pairing the two together after installing the latest September update on the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Meanwhile, the watch pairs perfectly fine with Samsung\u2019s own phones like the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7, so the problem seems limited to Pixel 10 devices.\n\n\u201cI am having serious issues in pairing the phone with the Samsung Watch Ultra. The pairing stops around 85% and then continues to search for a Bluetooth device. The watch has been updated to the August security patch yesterday, and after that had noticed significant battery drain. As a result, reset the watch and has lead to pairing issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cLiterally everyone on the new Pixel 10. Hit the search button. Forums are full of it. No fix yet. Yesterday\u2019s security patch did nothing for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoved my Watch8 classic over to the 10 Pro XL and it worked fine for a couple of hours, and then, the Galaxy Wearable app stopped detecting the watch. Rebooted the watch and phone and after a bit it was only connecting remotely via Wi-Fi. Factory reset the watch, and now it won\u2019t complete the setup process at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot just Ultra 8, I have Ultra 7 watch, have Pixel 10 pro, not connecting via Bluetooth! I had a Pixel 9 and did the latest update to Android 16 to it and no problem connecting! It is only with the 10 pro not connecting\u201d\n\nFor now, if you\u2019re trying to pair your Galaxy Watch 8, Ultra, or even older models with a Pixel 10, you\u2019ll probably need to wait or try multiple workarounds to make it happen. Hopefully, a future software update from Google or Samsung will smooth things out. Since both companies work closely on Wear OS, a fix should be on the way sooner rather than later.",

Learn more.\nPixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL debut as Google's most ambitious lineup yet\nAugust 20, 2025\nYear after year, Google has given us good reason to consider its latest Pixel lineup among the best Android phones you can buy. And while the company pushes both its hardware and software to new limits with each subsequent generation, this year, the Pixel 10 series has got to represent one of the biggest, boldest steps forward for the phones yet.\nOnce again, we\u2019ve got four new additions to the Pixel family to check out, with the launch of the Google Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. We\u2019re giving the new foldable some special attention of its own, but right now, let\u2019s break down exactly what you can expect from the three new traditional models forming this year\u2019s Pixel lineup.\nLong-term updates\nLoaded with Google AI features\nExcellent cameras\nPowerful AI tools\nTop-notch software\nBest specs and AI features\nGoogle Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL: Release date, price, and availability\n- Google Pixel 10 (128GB): $799 / \u00a3799\n- Google Pixel 10 (256GB): $899 / \u00a3899\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro (128GB): $999 / \u00a3999\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro (256GB): $1,099 / \u00a3,1,099\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro (512GB): $1,219 / \u00a31,219\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro (1TB): $1,449 / \u00a31,449\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro XL (256GB): $1,199 / \u00a31,199\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro XL (512GB): $1,319 / \u00a31,319\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro XL (1TB): $1,549 / \u00a31,549\nWe\u2019ve been looking forward to meeting the Pixel 10 series for ages now, and back in July, Google finally set the date for this season\u2019s Made By Google event. Today, with August 20 finally rolling around, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s chance to officially check out the new family, with Google showing them all off at its Brooklyn launch extravaganza.\nWhile this year introduces some important changes for the hardware that make up Google\u2019s Pixel phones, pricing is blessedly remaining consistent with last year\u2019s Pixel 9 devices, starting at just under $800 for the 128GB base model \u2014 and moving up from there.\nPre-orders for the new handsets open up today, so if you like what you see here, you don\u2019t have to waste any time getting the ball rolling on making a Pixel 10 model your next daily driver. For all three of these non-folding Pixels, regular retail availability kicks off next week, on August 28.\nGoogle is once again making its latest Pixel phones available to global audiences, kicking sales of the Pixel 10 series off in all the usual markets, with the addition of Mexico this time around. But this year, there\u2019s an important new distinction to be aware of regarding the hardware coming to the US versus the rest of the world \u2014 more on that in just a moment.\nGoogle Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL: Specs\nGoogle\u2019s definitely not going back to the drawing board with the Pixel 10 phones, and at a glance, it can be quite tricky to tell the new family apart from the last generation. But even with that approach to design remaining consistent, the manufacturer hasn\u2019t been afraid to deliver some impactful changes to the hardware you\u2019ll find within.\nWe\u2019ll be covering some of those more important differences in a little more depth, but here\u2019s your bird\u2019s-eye view at how all this hardware compares across the lineup:\n| Pixel 10 | Pixel 10 Pro | Pixel 10

new phone is imaging performance, raw speed, or excellent power management, you should be able to find something about these Pixel 10 phones to make them worthy of consideration. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the highlights.\nCamera\nSome phones really go all-in on camera hardware, and it\u2019s no surprise to see these models with beefy sensors and crazy periscopic zoom options on our list of best camera phones. But even without really jaw-dropping hardware, we also see Google\u2019s Pixel phones join those right up at the top, year after year, thanks in no small part to Google\u2019s exceptional image-processing prowess.\nMaybe the biggest news this year is the arrival of a telephoto option for the base Pixel 10, getting a 10.8MP camera with a 5x optical zoom. Google tries to sell that for a little more than it is, highlighting \u201cup to 10x optical quality\u201d and capable of even tighter zooms with Super Res processing, but we\u2019d be happy either way.\nDon\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority?\n- Set us as a preferred source in Google Search to support us and make sure you never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more. Find out more here.\nWith the Pro models, Google doubles down on that sentiment. Here it pairs a 48MP sensor with that 5x optical zoom, and the company claims this offers the highest-quality zoom you\u2019ll get of any smartphone being sold to US shoppers. Similarly, it\u2019s pushing processing to new heights, with these two boasting Pro Res Zoom up to 100x. That\u2019s optimized for the new Tensor G5 processor, and operates using an advanced diffusion model.\nIn addition to the fancy new zoom capabilities, you can expect some solid improvements to optical stabilization quality and auto-focus speed.\nPerformance\nOK, now we\u2019re getting into it. When your smartphone-obsessed friend advised you to hold off buying that Pixel 9 and wait for the Pixel 10 series, this is likely what they looking forward to: the Tensor G5 chip.\nGoogle\u2019s been building Pixel phones around its custom-designed Tensor processors for years now, but with this generation the company moves from Samsung to TSMC as its manufacturing partner \u2014 and as a consequence, jumps from the 4nm process it employed across the past two chips down to 3nm for the G5.\nGoogle's got more to prove than ever this year, with all eyes on the Tensor G5 and its performance.\nUnsurprisingly, this chip is heavily focused on AI capabilities. It can run on-device models with the help of an upgraded TPU, which Google says is 60% more powerful than before. That new production node doesn\u2019t just help the Tensor G5 run on average 34% faster but also aids in keeping power consumption down. And in case you haven\u2019t picked up on it from those incredible camera tricks we were just touching on, this chip\u2019s got an upgraded image processor on board.\nUnlike last year, we\u2019re not getting any big shake-ups when it comes to memory configuration. Google is sticking with the same 12GB for the base Pixel 10 and 16GB on the Pro and Pro XL. We\u2019d love seeing 16GB across the board, but the lack of motion here isn\u2019t exactly surprising.\nYour storage choices also remain largely consistent with the new Pixel 10 generation, still starting down at 128GB, but this time Google drops the 128GB option for the Pixel 10 Pro XL, starting at 256GB, instead \u2014 honestly, a trend we wouldn\u2019t hate to see trickle down to the rest of the phones.\nScreen quality and size\nGoogle\u2019s also sticking with what works when it comes to screen size and resolution, returning with the same 6.3-inch sizes on the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro, and a 6.8-inch panel on the Pro XL. On the smallest Pixel 10, that spells a pixel density of around 420ppi, while you\u2019ll enjoy a slightly sharper image closer to 490ppi on the Pro models. All three support Smooth Display output at up to 120Hz, but only the Pro models can also dial that down as low as 1Hz for power saving.\nPeak brightness should be about 10% higher this time around, from what Google calls \u201cbest in class\u201d Actua displays \u2014 and better yet, the company claims we\u2019ll get those brighter screens without feeling the impact on battery life. Just like we had with the Pixel 9 series, Google is tapping Corning for some Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection.\nDesign, colors, and build quality\nWhile last year brought us a major new look, with that new pill-shaped camera island on the back, the Pixel 10 is very much a smartphone cast in the physical mold of its predecessor. And comparing the sizes of these three phones against their Pixel 9 equivalents, the differences are absolutely minuscule: Really, the only distinction you\u2019ll measure is the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro each coming in a tenth of a millimeter thicker than last year.\nThere is, admittedly, a little heft being added this time around, but it\u2019s on a scale that might be too minor to notice outside of holding one phone in each hand \u2014 maxing out at an 11g difference with the Pixel 10 Pro XL.\nJust like on the front, Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protects the hardware around back, with a sturdy aluminum frame making up the middle of our smartphone sandwich. And as we\u2019d only expect, all three carry an IP68 ingress rating, so they\u2019ll have no trouble surviving a brief dunk.\nWhat's your favorite Pixel 10 series color?\nThe question of best Pixel colors is a contentious one, granted, and this year you\u2019ve got your choice of four no matter which Pixel you go with. In addition to the expected assortment of neutral tones, we get a few fun options, like Indigo and Lemongrass on the smallest Pixel 10 and Jade available for the Pro and Pro XL.\nDepending on where you get your Pixel 10, you may notice a low-key omission from the phone\u2019s expected design. For Pixel 10 series phones sold in the US, this year, Google is taking the unprecedented step of going eSIM-only: The phones will lack a traditional tray for a physical SIM card. While some users might not blink twice at that, those who rely upon the flexibility of physical SIMs (especially when traveling) could run into trouble \u2014 so be advised.\nBattery life and charging speed\nHere\u2019s one area in particular where we\u2019re feeling pretty optimistic this year \u2014 even if that\u2019s one word that\u2019s just positively fraught to throw around when we\u2019re talking all things battery. Instead of making one big change, Google has implemented several, and with any luck, they\u2019ll all add up to make the Pixel 10 series some real endurance champions.\nGoogle started by lowering power demands from phone components, with parts like the 3nm Tensor G5 chip and the updated Actua displays promising to merely sip away at battery capacity. On its own, that might not deliver in the way users hope, but Google pairs that with higher-capacity batteries across the board.\nNow, those gains themselves are a little minor: 270mAh higher on the Pixel 10, 170mAh higher with the 10 Pro, and up 140mAh on the Pro XL. But they are absolutely progressing in the right direction, and we will take all the extra juice phone manufacturers are willing to offer. Maybe most interesting, though, is that this year the little Pixel 10 actually manages to push past the Pro in terms of raw capacity \u2014 even though the phones are the same size, we guess not having a few of those Pro upgrades left room within for some extra battery.\nThat\u2019s consumption and capacity for you, but maybe Google\u2019s biggest win with power on the Pixel 10 series will come from how you recharge them.\nWith this generation, Google is finally giving users a full-featured wireless charging experience, and that means Qi2 support, complete with built-in magnets for secure attachment \u2014 no case required. The company is taking full advantage of this by introducing new Pixelsnap branding for accessories designed to tap into it \u2014 including a long-overdue successor to the Pixel Stand. You\u2019ll enjoy 15W wireless speeds on the Pixel 10 and Pro, while the Pro XL supports even speedier Qi2.2 25W charging.\nWired charging also gets a boost across the lineup, going from 27W to 30W for the Pixel 10 and Pro, while climbing from 37W to 45W on the Pixel 10 Pro XL. Google says that users should expect over 30 hours of battery life, and between all these upgrades, that sounds like it just might be within the realm of possibility.\nSoftware and updates\nUnlike last year, when the Pixel 9 phones arrived still running Android 14, Google has sorted out its development cycle, and Android 16 has arrived well in time to show up at home on the Pixel 10 phones. And with seven years of updates in the pipeline, you\u2019ll be running new Android releases well into the next decade.\nJust like everything Google touches these days, the Pixel 10 series is chock full of Gemini AI-powered features \u2014 including a full year of free access to Google AI Pro with the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL. Gemini Live is picking up some cool-sounding new tricks, like highlighting stuff in your camera to show you, and the Phone app is adding an impressive real-time translation tool.\nWe finally get to meet what would have been Pixel Sense with the introduction of Magic Cue, an AI-powered assistant with awareness of what you\u2019re working on with your phone, and the ability to offer suggested actions you may want to take next. In case that sounds like a step too far, Google\u2019s privacy controls will let you decide just how much of your data you want AI having access to.\nYou\u2019d have to be living in a cave not to understand how popular journaling is these days. Rather than forcing you to jot your thoughts down in something like Keep, Google\u2019s now offering a dedicated solution in the form of the new Pixel Journal app \u2014 complete with PIN protection to keep your private thoughts private.\nThere\u2019s tons more, too, from Call Message offering a hand dealing with your missed calls to Pixel Studio upgrades, new NotebookLM integration with Pixel Recorder and Screenshots, and Camera Coach helping you get your best shots yet. It\u2019s the new Pixel, after all! This is Google\u2019s biggest chance to show off all year! If you don\u2019t want to miss out on that experience, make sure to get your pre-order in now.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nI spent two weeks with the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, and I really think it's worth $500\nAugust 15, 2025\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic\nMSRP: $499.99\nWhat we like\nWhat we don't like\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic\nAt first glance, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic looks like a smartwatch so many of us have been waiting for. It\u2019s a Samsung watch with a reasonably-sized design, a bright display, tons of health features, and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 a rotating bezel. Paired with a massive software update and a big battery, it seems to check just about every box.\nBut does it all hold up in the real world? I spent a little over two weeks wearing the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic to find out, and for the most part, I think it does.\nThe Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is Samsung\u2019s smartwatch hardware at its best\nThe rotating bezel is probably one of the main reasons you\u2019re interested in the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, so let\u2019s start there. Simply put, it\u2019s terrific.\nCompared to the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic\u2019s bezel has noticeably thicker indents and a chunkier feel when rotated. In practice, I think these changes work out for the better. You can still freely spin the bezel to quickly scroll, but it\u2019s also easy to be precise and slowly turn it. It\u2019s such a satisfying thing to interact with, both for navigating the interface and also to fiddle with as a fidget toy throughout the day.\nThe rotating bezel is one of the main reasons to buy the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic \u2014 it's terrific.\nThe rotating bezel may not be a new concept for Samsung in 2025, but it remains one of my favorite smartwatch features of all time. It\u2019s so fun, so unique, and such a great feature to have back after its baffling absence on the Galaxy Watch Ultra.\nThe bezel is also more pronounced than it was on the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, thanks to its round shape sitting atop a squircle body. There has already been a lot of debate surrounding the Galaxy Watch 8\u2019s squircle aesthetic, and while I understand it won\u2019t be for everybody, I think it works well here.\nBetween the rotating bezel and the number markers it surrounds, the squircle shape is still there, but it\u2019s not as immediately distracting as it appears on the regular Galaxy Watch 8. It adds some visual flair without looking out of place, and it\u2019s something that has really grown on me. The more I wear the Watch 8 Classic, the more I find myself glancing at it throughout the day just to admire its design.\nBeyond its distinctive looks, there\u2019s another reason for the squircle shape: Samsung\u2019s new Dynamic Lug watch band system. Where the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic used standard 20mm watch bands that attached to the watch\u2019s integrated lugs, the Watch 8 Classic\u2019s new system sees watch bands attaching directly to the case.\nPersonally, I love it. For one thing, the new bands couldn\u2019t be easier to add/remove; all you have to do is press a button to pull the bands off or attach them to the watch (there\u2019s no awkward twisting like with the Pixel Watch bands). Additionally, the removal of the built-in lugs means the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic sits so much more comfortably on my wrist than the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic ever did.\nThe obvious downside is that, since this is a proprietary system, any 20mm watch bands you may have collected from previous Galaxy Watches won\u2019t work with the Watch 8 Classic. That\u2019s a very real issue for some people, but if this Dynamic Lug system is what Samsung plans to use moving forward, I think it\u2019s a change for the better.\nFinally, there\u2019s the display. In almost every regard, it\u2019s fantastic. The Super AMOLED panel is sharp and colorful, while the 3,000 nits of maximum brightness mean I\u2019ve never had an issue seeing the screen outdoors. That said, the 1.34-inch size has felt a little cramped.\nFor context, this is the same screen size as the 40mm Galaxy Watch 8. With the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic having a 46mm case, it\u2019s frustrating that the screen is as small as it is \u2014 especially considering that the 44mm Galaxy Watch 8 has a 1.47-inch display. It\u2019s far from a deal-breaker, but it\u2019s an annoying quirk nonetheless.\nOne UI 8 Watch is my new favorite version of Wear OS\nWhat\u2019s not annoying, however, is One UI 8 Watch \u2014 the latest version of Samsung\u2019s smartwatch software that\u2019s available out-of-the-box on the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. We were impressed with One UI 8 Watch earlier this year when the beta was rolling out, and having now used it myself, I think it may be my new favorite way to use Wear OS.\nA big part of this is how One UI 8 Watch handles tiles. In all other versions of Wear OS, tiles (Wear OS\u2019s version of widgets) take up the entire screen. So, you can have a weather tile on one page, a calendar tile on another, and so on.\nIn One UI 8 Watch, Samsung forgoes the full-screen experience in favor of allowing multiple tiles on a single page. Tiles now come in two sizes (small and large) and you can seemingly add as many as you\u2019d like to any single page.\nFor example, I have a \u201cHealth\u201d page with tiles for my Samsung Health activity, my energy score, sleep tracking, blood oxygen, stress tracking, and an ECG app shortcut. Next to that is another page with a tile for my next calendar event, the current weather conditions, my next alarm, and some calculator shortcuts.\nIn other words, tiles that would have previously taken up 10 separate pages \u2014 and required a lot of scrolling \u2014 are now reduced to just two pages. This has resulted in me using and interacting with tiles on the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic far more than I usually do on other Wear OS watches, and I\u2019d say that\u2019s a big achievement on Samsung\u2019s part.\nAnother nice touch is the Now Bar. Similar to One UI 8 on Samsung phones, the Now Bar appears at the bottom of the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic for different types of live activities (such as a timer, an active workout, media playback, etc.). Being able to glance at my watch to see how much time is remaining on a timer without having to keep the timer app open may sound like a small thing, but it\u2019s such a nice convenience in day-to-day use.\nAlso, while it\u2019s not directly related to One UI 8 Watch, having Gemini built into the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is great. Even this early on, Gemini is a substantial upgrade over Google Assistant, and it\u2019s made me no longer despise using voice commands with a Wear OS smartwatch. Good job, Google.\nOne UI 8 Watch may be my new favorite way to use Wear OS.\nAlthough most of my experience with One UI 8 Watch has been excellent, it hasn\u2019t been without a couple of faults. Numerous times throughout my two weeks with the Watch 8 Classic, it\u2019s lost its connection to my Galaxy Z Flip 7 for a few seconds before automatically reconnecting. More annoying is that almost every morning after I wake up and disable Sleep Mode, the always-on display remains toggled off, forcing me to manually re-enable it.\nLike the display size, these aren\u2019t game-breaking issues, but they\u2019re ones I can\u2019t help but notice. Unlike the display size, though, these are issues that Samsung can (hopefully) fix in a future software update.\nLoads and loads of health features\nBeing a Samsung watch, it shouldn\u2019t be any surprise that the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic relies on Samsung Health for its health/fitness platform. Like other modern Samsung watches, that means the Watch 8 Classic is loaded to the brim with health features and sensors. Basically, everything you could ask for is here, including:\n- All-day activity tracking.\n- Sleep tracking (including a sleep score and sleep coaching).\n- Sleep apnea detection.\n- Daily energy score.\n- Stress monitoring.\n- Blood oxygen (SpO2) tracking.\n- Skin temperature sensor.\n- ECG app.\n- Body composition (to track your fat mass, skeletal muscle, BMI, and more).\nFor the most part, all of this works incredibly well. The activity tracking is motivating, the sleep tracking is accurate, and Samsung\u2019s energy score is usually in line with how I\u2019m feeling each day (if a little generous).\nI have noticed that the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic often provides me with inaccurate blood oxygen readings. Most nights while sleeping, the Watch 8 Classic shows my SpO2 levels dipping to 91% or 90%, with other nights going as low as 88%, 87%, and even 84% \u2014 which would put me in a hospital. This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve experienced issues with wonky SpO2 tracking on a Samsung wearable, so while it\u2019s not surprising that the issue persists on the Watch 8 Classic, it is disappointing.\nThankfully, other components \u2014 like the heart rate sensor and GPS \u2014 have been much more reliable. I\u2019ve had precisely one strength workout where my heart rate was recorded much lower than expected, but otherwise, it has been spot on. The dual-band GPS has also been consistent, quickly grabbing a signal and accurately mapping my outdoor runs and walks without any glaring issues.\nSpeaking of runs, one of the main new health features for the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is Running Coach. You start by doing a 12-minute test run for Running Coach to gauge your performance, after which it assigns you a running level and an accompanying training plan.\nSamsung put me in Level 6, which is the first level for the \u201cBeginners\u2019 half-marathon\u201d section. My first workout was a 50-minute jog, followed by a repetition run, and then a longer 60-minute jog. The runs are pace-based, with Running Coach providing on-screen guidance and audio cues to help you stay on track.\nWhile I can see the limitations of Running Coach for more advanced runners, I\u2019ve been pretty happy with the feature so far. It\u2019s already encouraged and pushed me to run farther than I\u2019ve been doing on my own. It\u2019s also helped me establish a better habit of warming up before and cooling down after my runs. The difficulty spike is a little concerning, as my next run is a daunting 8.07 miles (my previous longest run was 5.8 miles), but I\u2019m looking forward to sticking with Running Coach even after this review is published.\nThere are some other new health features, though I\u2019m not quite as sold on their usefulness. Antioxidant index is one such feature. It claims to rate your body\u2019s antioxidant levels, and while it\u2019s a novel idea, I\u2019m not convinced about its accuracy. My levels are consistently Low or Very low, despite eating a fairly balanced diet. Interestingly, my score actually decreased one afternoon after I\u2019d eaten a cup of blueberries. You also have to remove the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic and place your thumb on the back of it to take a measurement, which is a big enough hurdle that I\u2019ve been inclined to ignore the feature.\nThe other new addition, vascular load, rates your body\u2019s vascular system performance based on your sleep, activity, and stress. My numbers here look good, but outside of yet another reminder to get good sleep and maintain an active lifestyle, I\u2019m not sure how useful it really is.\nAs is often the case with Samsung Health, not everything sticks, but Samsung certainly throws a lot at the wall for people to play with. And honestly, I\u2019m OK with this approach. There\u2019s a lot of health data you can collect with the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, much of which you won\u2019t find on a non-Samsung smartwatch. In a world where the Apple Watch is still struggling to offer blood oxygen tracking, I have to give Samsung credit here.\nGood battery life, fine charging\nBefore we get out of here and start wrapping things up, a few words on the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic\u2019s battery life and charging.\nThroughout my time wearing the Watch 8 Classic, it\u2019s consistently gotten me through about a day and a half per charge \u2014 and that includes at least one workout per day and sleep tracking overnight. If I put on the watch with a fully charged battery at 8AM, I can expect to reach 3PM the following day before needing to find the charger. For context, this is with the always-on display enabled.\nThe fastest I drained the battery was starting with 100% at 7:45AM and dipping to 17% at 10:55PM that night, but that was the day I tracked a six-mile outdoor run with a podcast playing the entire time.\nCharging speeds, on the other hand, aren\u2019t quite as impressive. The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic charges quickly at first, achieving a 50% charge in just 30 minutes, but then takes a full 75 minutes before finally reaching 100%.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic review: The Samsung watch to buy in 2025?\nLooking back on my two weeks with the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a stretch to say that this is the most I\u2019ve enjoyed a Samsung smartwatch in years. I love the classy design and how the watch feels on my wrist. The rotating bezel remains just as fun as it has always been. One UI 8 Watch is an incredible piece of software, and Samsung\u2019s health/fitness toolkit is one of the largest you can find. Combine that with great performance, display quality, and battery life, and you have a truly impressive package.\nBut is that package worth the $500 Samsung wants for the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (or $550 for the LTE model)? Personally, I think it is.\nThe counterargument is the regular Galaxy Watch 8 ($349.99 at Amazon). It has all of the same features as the Watch 8 Classic, just with a smaller battery, a simpler design, and no rotating bezel. It\u2019s objectively a better value at $350, but part of the reason I love the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic so much is its bezel and sophisticated design. If those don\u2019t matter to you, the regular Galaxy Watch 8 is a good idea, but its ultra-simplistic hardware isn\u2019t for me.\nThis is the most I've enjoyed a Samsung smartwatch in years.\nAnother strong alternative is the OnePlus Watch 3 ($329.99 at Amazon). It has a great design, an excellent rotating crown, a huge display, and some of the best battery life and charging speeds available on a Wear OS watch today. OnePlus\u2019s health tracking platform isn\u2019t as robust, and there\u2019s no LTE model available; however, it\u2019s still an incredibly good value for $330. And, of course, it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on the Pixel Watch 4, which is expected to arrive on August 20.\nGiven the mounting competition and the Watch 8 Classic\u2019s relatively steep price, I\u2019ll be the first to admit that it\u2019s not the most sensible or practical smartwatch you can buy. If your primary concern is getting the most bang for your buck, you\u2019re better off with something else.\nBut if you place value in how a watch looks and how it makes you feel, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic can\u2019t be ignored. I adore its design. I can\u2019t get enough of that rotating bezel. It\u2019s how the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic gets the meat and potatoes right while simultaneously being a genuinely fun and attractive timepiece \u2014 something a base Galaxy Watch or Pixel Watch will never achieve in the same way.\nIf that\u2019s the kind of Wear OS watch you\u2019re after, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is the one for you.\n- The rotating bezel is back\n- New watch band system is fantastic\n- One UI 8 Watch is a huge upgrade\n- Gemini built-in\n- Endless Samsung Health features\n- Running Coach is a great addition\n- 1.3-inch display feels cramped\n- Wonky SpO2 tracking\n- Antioxidant and vascular load features are questionable\n- Significantly more expensive than regular Galaxy Watch 8\nThank you for being part of our community.
