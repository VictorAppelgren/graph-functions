  "content": "Dear Eric: Our next-door neighbor is a longtime university professor who is well known in his field. We have been neighbors for many years, and we all get along well. He lives alone.\n\nAn irritating habit of his is to stop by and launch into long-winded stories about some mundane event in his present or past life or to pontificate about a current event. He fancies himself as a raconteur and because he is used to having a lecture hall of students listening to him (supposedly), he thinks we also should be entertained and enthralled by his musings. We aren\u2019t.\n\nIt is particularly annoying because he never asks about anything going on in our lives. Another mutual friend is equally frustrated with him.\n\nDo you have any suggestions to deal with this? It doesn\u2019t happen frequently enough to demand a strong response that might damage our friendship.\n\nDear Wind: It may be effective to catch him in the moment and redirect. \u201cHold that thought; we were in the middle of a different conversation, if you\u2019d like to join us.\u201d Something like that. Or you can ask him a question that moves him off of the pontification. Or you can simply say, \u201cwould you give me the CliffsNotes?\u201d A good raconteur knows a good story is not much without a good audience. And a good audience is different from \u201cliterally anybody who is within earshot.\u201d\n\nBecause you don\u2019t want to make a big deal out of it, you don\u2019t need to address the content of his mini speeches, if you don\u2019t want to. But it\u2019s a good idea to gently but clearly adjust the expectation. If he finds that every time he shows up, he\u2019s being redirected or invited into another kind of conversation, he may start to understand his audience in a different way. He may understand that he doesn\u2019t need to do this performance at all. Indeed, you\u2019re not actually his audience \u2013 you\u2019re his friends.\n\nDear Eric: I have known my friend Steve for more than 10 years. He is a different race than me, but race has never been an issue until recently. I texted him to compliment him on how his looks, personality and family life reminds me of a well-known actor who is a well-respected family man and good-looking. It was a compliment.\n\nHe responded by telling me that he was offended by the racist comment and to retract the comment. I refuse because the actor has done nothing illegal, has a good character, is a positive family man, is a good actor and is nice-looking. All characters Steve has. I\u2019m at a loss. How do I respond?\n\nDear Compliment: It seems easiest to tell Steve, \u201cI meant no harm by what I said and I\u2019m sorry that it offended you.\u201d Not only is this the truth, but it doesn\u2019t needlessly prolong a conflict that doesn\u2019t really impact either of you.\n\nIt\u2019s clear that either Steve doesn\u2019t see the actor in the same way or doesn\u2019t think that he resembles the actor. If that\u2019s the case, then your compliment may come across as an indication that you don\u2019t see him in all his complexity. Maybe this has happened before with others and you\u2019re getting the blowback from it. Who knows. You don\u2019t need to belabor the point, but saying \u201csorry\u201d and moving on will free you both.\n\nAnd, if you can both move on, you can \u2013 if you want \u2013 ask him to tell you more about his reaction to the actor. But it\u2019s not really about the actor, or your feelings about the actor. It\u2019s about your friendship and the opportunity to get to know Steve better. Asking a friend, \u201cwhy do you think that?\u201d \u2013 in a non-charged way \u2013 or \u201ccan you tell me more about your feelings?\u201d can open up the door to great conversation and new understanding all around.\n\nDear Eric: I chuckled out loud when I read the letter from \u201cGiftless\u201d, who was angry that her daughter didn\u2019t get wedding gifts from some friends that weren\u2019t invited to the wedding. A few years ago, the son of one of my best friends got married in a small ceremony at a destination spot. We were not invited, understandably.\n\nAs I\u2019ve known this man since he was a small child, my husband and I sent a card and generous check, just because we were happy for them. His mom called me the week after and said, \u201cwhy in the world did you send them a gift? You weren\u2019t even invited!\u201d Couldn\u2019t be more different than the letter writer. Just goes to show people can have many different takes on a situation/event!\n\nDear Gift-ful: Exactly! Different strokes for different folks. Gifts are expressions of love and affection, not debts owed for invitations.",

  "summary": "The author suggests ways to address an issue of long-winded conversations with their neighbor, a university professor who believes he is a raconteur who thinks he should be entertaining and enthralled by his own thoughts. This is particularly annoying as he never asks about current events. Suggestions for dealing with this issue include redirecting the conversation or asking him to share his thoughts in a non-charged way or suggesting that he may understand his audience differently. A compliment complimented Steve's appearance and family life reminds him of a well-respected family man and good-looking actor. However, he responded to the compliment with a retraction and retracting the comment. The author suggests these suggestions can be used to clarify the expectations of the speaker and clarify the situation.",
