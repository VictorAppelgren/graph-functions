  "content": "The decline in payroll employment in the UK eased in July, with employers cutting headcount by 8,000, compared to a month-on-month drop of 26,000 in June.\n\nJuly\u2019s figure marks the smallest decline in headcount since a modest rise in January, offering a glimmer of hope for the sluggish UK job market.\n\nThe early estimate of payrolled employees for July 2025 decreased by 164,000 on the year, added the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nTuesday\u2019s data \u201ctallies with some of the business surveys which suggest hiring appetite has begun to improve after a torrid spring\u201d, said James Smith, developed market economist at ING.\n\n\u201cThe combination of National Insurance (payroll tax) hikes and a sizeable increase in the National Living Wage in April had become a major headwind, particularly in consumer services.\u201d\n\nThe ONS also announced on Tuesday that the unemployment rate held steady in April to June at 4.7%, a four-year high.\n\nAnnual wage growth excluding bonuses held steady at 5.0% in the three months to June, while this average in the private-sector eased slightly to 4.8% from 4.9%.\n\u2022 Struggling to find work? UK sees more jobseekers and fewer vacancies\n\u2022 BoE chief says collaboration is key to solving economic imbalances\n\n\u201cAlthough pay growth has slowed, it\u2019s now pretty static, and is still outstripping inflation, so there\u2019s a risk that firms will pass on heavier costs as higher prices,\u201d said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.\n\nShe added: \u201cBank of England policymakers struck a more cautious tone than expected at the last meeting when it comes to future policy, and this jobs snapshot doesn\u2019t change the overall picture too much. It\u2019s touch and go as to whether there will be a cut in November but December is looking a bit more likely.\u201d\n\nThe fresh data comes after the Bank of England cut its key interest rate last week to 4%, the lowest level since March 2023.\n\nVacancies are below pre-Covid levels in virtually all sectors now, highlighting the weakness of the labour market, although price pressures remain a risk to the economy.\n\nThe number of job vacancies fell by 44,000 to 718,000 between May and July.\n\n\u201cThe Bank faces a fine balancing act,\u201d said Richard Carter, head of fixed interest research at Quilter Cheviot.\n\n\u201cInflation remains at 3.6%, fuelled by housing and transport costs, but signs of slack in the labour market are becoming harder to ignore. With the MPC split on the pace of easing, these latest numbers could tip the balance towards further cuts to shore up the economy.\"",

      "text": "Speaking in Brussels, Andrew Bailey warned that fragmentation was \"bad for global growth\" during a time of uncertainty.\nGlobal players must work together to solve economic imbalances rather than allowing disparities to drive them apart, said the Governor of the Bank of England on Tuesday.\n\u201cWhere we have pressures caused by imbalances we have to get to the bottom of the economics of what's causing those imbalances,\u201d claimed Andrew Bailey.\nHe was speaking at an event organised by the think tank, Bruegel, in Belgium.\nOrganisations like the International Monetary Fund, Bailey added, have a \u201ccrucial role\u201d to play in this respect.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way we can begin to get these issues on the table\u201d without fragmenting global partnerships, he explained.\nThe governor warned that the world is currently in a period of heightened uncertainty, meaning that collaboration is essential to support global growth.\nTariff risks\nBailey\u2019s comments come as markets are contending with unpredictable trade announcements from US President Donald Trump.\nAfter announcing a 10% levy on all imported Chinese goods, Washington is now developing custom tariffs for specific countries, which could be ready at the start of April.\nTrump is notably intent on rebalancing the US\u2019 trade deficit, which hit a record $1.2 trillion (\u20ac1.1tn) last year.\nIn the President\u2019s eyes, the disparity between exports and imports is a sign of national economic weakness, although experts argue that this imbalance can partially be explained by the strength of the US dollar.\nWhen the dollar is strong, imports are relatively cheap for US buyers and US exports are more expensive for international buyers.\nWhile tariffs are negative for global growth, the inflationary consequences are less predictable - said Bailey.\nThey notably depend on trade redirection and potential retaliatory measures.\nPrice pressures\nHoning in on the inflationary picture in the UK, Bailey noted that price pressures were easing and that the nation was facing a \u201cweak growth environment\u201d.\nThis led the Bank of England to cut rates by a quarter point to 4.5% earlier this month.\nAt the same meeting, the bank also halved its 2025 growth forecasts, although upgraded its predictions for both 2026 and 2027.\nThe economy is now forecast to grow by 1.5% in both of those years, up from 1.25%.\nThe Office for National Statistics also confirmed on Tuesday that UK wages are growing in both the public and private sectors.\nAverage weekly earnings in the three months to December grew 5.9% year-on-year, up from 5.6% in the previous quarter.\n\u201cPay growth went up, but actually not quite as much as we were expecting,\u201d said Bailey, speaking at the Bruegel event.\nThe governor added that UK inflation is expected to pick up in the short term, but this is linked to regulated prices such as energy and water.\nThey therefore don\u2019t point to the underlying health of the economy, he explained."

      "text": "UK vacancies continued to decline in February as businesses paused or slowed their hiring plans due to a subdued economic outlook and rising payroll costs.\nAccording to KPMG and REC\u2019s latest job market survey, the number of vacancies fell for the sixteenth month running in February.\nThe report, compiled by S&P Global after surveying around 400 UK recruitment and employment consultancies, showed that permanent vacancies continued to decline at a slightly sharper pace than temporary roles.\nPermanent staff appointments fell for the twenty-ninth month in a row, yet the latest drop in placements was the softest since last October.\n\u201cWhile it is still a wait and see approach to hiring, with February data showing companies continue to hold back on recruitment, the softer decline could be an indication that expectations of further interest rate cuts and better-than-expected recent economic data are starting to release some of the pressures on business,\u201d Jon Holt, Group Chief Executive and UK Senior Partner KPMG, said.\nAccording to the report, vacancies declined the most in permanent positions in secretarial and clerical jobs, followed by executive/professional and retail sectors.\nTemporary staff openings were also greatly reduced in executive/professional roles, followed by retail and IT & computing. Blue collar positions recorded the softest drop in temporary vacancies.\nRelated\n-\nUK wages receive a year-end boost as private sector remains robust\n-\nUK house prices see gains slow in February as stamp duty deadline looms\nStarting salaries rising slowly\nWhile vacancies dropped, redundancies further increased the number of unemployed individuals.\nFebruary data indicated that the number of candidates searching for both permanent and temporary roles is increasing fast.\nSlowing employer demand coupled with an increased number of job seekers kept a lid on overall pay pressures.\nAs a result, starting salaries rose at the weakest pace in four years and dipped below average. Pay growth in temporary jobs remained marginal.\nUnemployment expected to inch higher\nAccording to the latest data from ONS, the UK unemployment rate was 4.4% between October and December 2024.\nHowever, redundancies are expected to rise further due to a hike in employers' National Insurance contributions and a 6.7% rise in the minimum wage.\n\u201cEnabling companies to grow is at the heart of our prosperity \u2013 the Chancellor must use the Spring Statement to build their confidence in growth,\u201d Neil Carberry, REC Chief Executive, said.\n\u201cAt the moment, though, things are still slow as companies hold their breath in the face of significant costs rises from April with changes to National Insurance and the National Living Wage,\u201d he added."
