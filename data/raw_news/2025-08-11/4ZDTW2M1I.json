  "title": "Seoul-based Datumo raises $15.5M to take on Scale AI, backed by Salesforce",
  "description": "Most organizations say they aren\u2019t fully prepared to use generative AI in a safe and responsible way, according to a recent McKinsey report. One concern",
  "content": "Most organizations say they aren\u2019t fully prepared to use generative AI in a safe and responsible way, according to a recent McKinsey report. One concern is explainability \u2013 understanding how and why AI makes certain decisions. While 40% of respondents view it as a significant risk, only 17% are actively addressing it, per the report.\n\nSeoul-based Datumo began as an AI data labeling company and now wants to help businesses build safer AI with tools and data that enable testing, monitoring, and improving their models\u2014without requiring technical expertise. On Monday the startup raised $15.5 million, which brings its total raised to approximately $28 million, from investors including Salesforce Ventures, KB Investment, and SBI Investment, among others.\n\nDavid Kim, CEO of Datumo and a former AI researcher at Korea\u2019s Agency for Defence Development, was frustrated by the time-consuming nature of data labeling so he came up with a new idea: a reward-based app that lets anyone label data in their spare time and earn money. The startup validated the idea at a startup competition at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology). Kim co-founded Datumo, formerly known as SelectStar, alongside five KAIST alumni in 2018.\n\nEven before the app was fully built, Datumo secured tens of thousands of dollars in pre-contract sales during the customer discovery phase of the competition, mostly from KAIST alumni-led businesses and startups.\n\nIn its first year, the startup surpassed $1 million in revenue and secured several key contracts. Today, the startup counts major Korean companies like Samsung, Samsung SDS, LG Electronics, LG CNS, Hyundai, Naver, and Seoul-based telecom giant SK Telecom among its clients. Several years ago, however, clients began asking the company to go beyond simple data labeling. The seven-year-old startup now has more than 300 clients in South Korea and generated about $6 million in revenue in 2024.\n\n\u201cThey wanted us to score their AI model outputs or compare them to other outputs,\u201d Michael Hwang, co-founder of Datumo, told TechCrunch. \u201cThat\u2019s when we realized: we were already doing AI model evaluation \u2014 without even knowing it.\u201d Datumo doubled down on this area and released Korea\u2019s first benchmark dataset focused on AI trust and safety, Hwang added.\n\n\u201cWe started in data annotation, then expanded into pretraining datasets and evaluation as the LLM ecosystem matured,\u201d Kim told TechCrunch.\n\nMeta\u2019s recent $14.3 billion acquisition-like investment in data-labeling company Scale AI highlights the importance of this market. Shortly after that deal, AI model maker and Meta competitor OpenAI stopped using Scale AI\u2019s services. The Meta deal also signals that competition for AI training data is intensifying.\n\nDatumo shares some similarities with companies like Scale AI in pretraining dataset provisioning, and with Galileo and Arize AI in AI evaluation and monitoring. However, it differentiates itself through its licensed datasets, particularly data crawled from published books, which the company says offers rich structured human reasoning but is notoriously difficult to clean, according to CEO Kim.\n\nUnlike its peers, Datumo also offers a full-stack evaluation platform called Datumo Eval, which automatically generates test data and evaluations to check for unsafe, biased or incorrect responses without the need for manual scripting, Kim added. The signature product is a no-code evaluation tool designed for non-developers like those on policy, trust and safety, and compliance teams.\n\nWhen asked about attracting investors like Salesforce Ventures, Kim explained that the startup had previously hosted a fireside chat with Andrew Ng, founder of DeepLearning.AI, at an event in South Korea. After the event, Kim shared the session on LinkedIn, which caught the attention of Salesforce Ventures. Following several meetings and Zoom calls, the investors extended a soft commitment. The entire funding process took about eight months, Hwang said.\n\nThe new funding will be used to accelerate R&D efforts, particularly in developing automated evaluation tools for enterprise AI, and to scale global go-to-market operations across South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. The startup, which has 150 employees in Seoul, also established a presence in Silicon Valley in March.",

      "text": "There are numerous observability platforms that monitor and evaluate cloud software, like Dynatrace and ServiceNow, which flag potential code errors or failures so engineers can find and fix them. Arize AI says it is bringing that same approach to AI models and applications.\nArize is an AI observability platform that helps companies evaluate their AI products as they are building them and then monitor those products for errors and issues once they are up and running. Arize\u2019s platform works with a variety of AI applications, from machine learning and computer vision to generative AI.\nJason Lopatecki, Arize co-founder and CEO (pictured above, left), told TechCrunch that Arize uses a \u201ccouncil of judges\u201d approach to monitor and evaluate AI. This approach includes evaluating AI with different AI models \u2014 which Lopatecki joked is, yes, very meta \u2014 in addition to having humans in the loop.\nThe idea behind Arize came from Lopatecki\u2019s previous company, TubeMogul, a brand advertising company, which was acquired by Adobe for over $500 million in 2016.\nEverything at TubeMogul ran on AI, Lopatecki said, and when it would break it would be a \u201cbig deal\u201d since the technology was so complicated. Aparna Dhinakaran, a co-founder and CPO at Arize (pictured above, right), who met Lopatecki through TubeMogul, had run into similar issues developing language models without having the proper tools to test and evaluate as she built.\n\u201cWe both saw the problem space and really had that idea that AI is going to be high stakes in more and more organizations everywhere,\u201d Lopatecki said. \u201cIt\u2019s so complicated, it\u2019s really hard to tell what it\u2019s doing, when it\u2019s broken and how to fix it.\u201d\nThe pair launched Arize in 2020 with an initial focus on the AI trend of the day: predictive machine learning. Lopatecki said that when Arize got started, it was really just an idea. Today, five years later, the market gets the problem and Arize\u2019s platform works with everything from AI agents to generative AI.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\n\u201cSo the last two years have been, I would say, explosive, explosive in growth,\u201d Lopatecki said. \u201cSimply because [AI] is more accessible. Everyone\u2019s a prompt engineer. Every engineer is a prompt engineer. Everyone is integrating [AI] products into their product lines.\u201d\nArize now works with enterprises including Uber, Klaviyo, and Tripadvisor, among others. The company also has an open source offering, Arize Phoenix, which has more than two million monthly downloads.\nThe Berkeley, California-based company recently raised a $70 million Series C round led by Adams Street Partners with participation from M12, SineWave Ventures, and OMERS Ventures, among other investors, in addition to strategic backers including Datadog and PagerDuty. This brings the company\u2019s total funding to more than $130 million to date.\nThe company plans to put its latest round of funding toward improving its main product and doubling down on growing AI segments, including voice and AI agents. Dhinakaran joked that while their open source product may be their biggest competitor, the company plans to put more money into developing that product, too.\n\u201cOur open source Phoenix has just been growing, it\u2019s been growing massively, and so I think we love that. We love open source,\u201d Dhinakaran said.\nThe AI observability and evaluation space is becoming increasingly crowded. Dhinakaran said that they think that Arize offers both pre- and post-launch evaluations, and can be used across a variety of different AI applications, which helps the company stand out; although, there are companies with very similar offerings, like Galileo, which has raised $68 million in venture funding, and Patronus AI, which has raised $20 million in funding.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to build the [infrastructure] to do this, right?\u201d Lopatecki said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of why I think the Microsofts and Datadogs are investing in us, or making a bet on us. I think people also now see how big this market can be. You\u2019re going to have a lot of little guys. You\u2019re gonna have big people jumping in it, and I expect it to be a fast, growing, large market.\u201d\nThis piece has been updated to better reflect when Arize was founded."

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions. And I think about companies in the same way\u2014there are these crucible moments that have an enormous bearing on ultimate outcomes.\nRoelof's Sessions\nWhat Sequoia Sees Coming Next\nAs one of the most influential VCs of the modern era, Roelof Botha has seen it all; booms, busts, and billion-dollar breakout bets.

      "text": "Galileo, a startup launching a platform for AI model development, today announced that it raised $18 million in a Series A round led by Battery Ventures with participation from The Factory, Walden Catalyst, FPV Ventures, Kaggle co-founder Anthony Goldbloom and other angel investors. The new cash brings the company\u2019s total raised to $23.1 million and will be put toward growing Galileo\u2019s engineering and go-to-market teams and expanding the core platform to support new data modalities, CEO Vikram Chatterji told TechCrunch via email.\nAs the use of AI becomes more common throughout the enterprise, the demand for products that make it easier to inspect, discover and fix critical AI errors is increasing. According to one recent survey (from MLOps Community), 84.3% of data scientists and machine learning engineers say that the time required to detect and diagnose problems with a model is a problem for their teams, while over one in four (26.2%) admit that it takes them a week or more to detect and fix issues.\nSome of those issues include mislabeled data, where the labels used to train an AI system contain errors, like a picture of a tree mistakenly labeled \u201chouseplant.\u201d Others pertain to data drift or data imbalance, which happens when data evolves to make an AI system less accurate (think a stock market model trained on pre-pandemic data) or the data isn\u2019t sufficiently representative of a domain (e.g., a data set of headshots has more light-skinned people than dark-skinned).\nGalileo\u2019s platform aims to systematize AI development pipelines across teams using \u201cauto-loggers\u201d and algorithms that spotlight system-breaking issues. Built to be deployable in an on-premises environment, Galileo scales across the AI workflow \u2014 from predevelopment to postproduction \u2014 as well as unstructured data modalities like text, speech and vision.\nIn data science, \u201cunstructured\u201d data usually refers to data that\u2019s not arranged according to a preset data model or schema, like invoices or sensor data. Atindriyo Sanyal \u2014 Galileo\u2019s second co-founder \u2014 makes the case that the Excel- and Python script\u2013based processes to ensure quality data is being fed into models are manual, error-prone and costly.\n\u201cWhen inspecting their data with Galileo, users instantly uncover the long tail of data errors such as mislabeled data, underrepresented languages [and] garbage data that they can immediately take action upon within Galileo by removing, re-labeling or by adding additional similar data from production,\u201d Sanyal told TechCrunch in an email interview. \u201cIt has been critical for teams that Galileo supports machine learning data workflows end to end \u2014 even when a model is in production, Galileo automatically lets teams know of data drifts, and surfaces the highest-value data to train with next.\u201d\nThe co-founding team at Galileo spent more than a decade building machine learning products, where they say they faced the challenges of developing AI systems firsthand. Chatterji led product management at Google AI, while Sanyal spearheaded engineering at Uber\u2019s AI division and was an early member of the Siri team at Apple. Third Galileo co-founder Yash Sheth is another Google veteran, having previously led the company\u2019s speech recognition platform team.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nGalileo\u2019s platform falls into the burgeoning category of software known as MLOps, a set of tools to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production. It\u2019s in serious demand. By one estimation, the market for MLOps could reach $4 billion by 2025.\nThere\u2019s no shortage of startups going after the space, like Comet, which raised $50 million last November. Other vendors with VC backing include Arize, Tecton, Diveplane, Iterative and Taiwan-based InfuseAI.\nBut despite having launched just a few months ago, Galileo has paying customers from \u201chigh-growth\u201d startups to Fortune 500 companies, Sanyal claims. \u201cOur customers are using Galileo while building machine learning applications such as hate speech detection, caller intent detection at contact centers and customer experience augmentation with conversational AI,\u201d he added.\nSanyal expects the launch of Galileo\u2019s free offering \u2014 Galileo Community Edition \u2014 will boost sign-ups further. The Community Edition enables data scientists working on natural language processing to build machine learning models using some of the tools included in the paid version, Sanyal said.\n\u201cWith Galileo Community Edition, anyone can sign up for free, add a few lines of code while training their model with labeled data or during an inference run with unlabeled data to instantly inspect, find and fix data errors, or select the right data to label next using the powerful Galileo UI,\u201d he added.\nSanyal declined to share revenue figures when asked. But he noted that San Francisco\u2013based Galileo\u2019s headcount has grown in size from 14 people in May to \u201cmore than\u201d 20 people as of today."

      "text": "OpenAI is phasing out its work with Scale AI and cutting ties with the data provider following Meta\u2019s deal with the startup, an OpenAI spokesperson told Bloomberg on Wednesday.\nSarah Friar, the chief financial officer of OpenAI, previously suggested the company would continue its work with Scale AI. Now, it appears OpenAI has changed its tone.\nOpenAI said it was already winding down its work with Scale AI ahead of Meta\u2019s announcement last week that it was investing billions of dollars in the startup and bringing on CEO Alexandr Wang. An OpenAI spokesperson told Bloomberg that OpenAI had been seeking other providers for more specialized data to develop increasingly advanced AI models.\nOpenAI\u2019s decision to cut ties raises questions about Scale AI\u2019s core data labeling business. Last week, Reuters reported that Google was discussing plans to drop Scale AI as a data provider as well.\nAs rumors swirled about Meta\u2019s deal with Wang, some of Scale AI\u2019s competitors said they received an influx of interest from AI model providers looking for \u201cneutral\u201d partners.\nIn a blog post published Wednesday, Scale AI\u2019s general counsel tried to squash the idea that Meta would receive preferential treatment following this deal. Scale AI\u2019s executives said it would not share confidential information from other customers with Meta, and that Wang would not be involved in day-to-day operations.\nDespite those claims, it seems that Scale AI\u2019s biggest customers are already pivoting away from the data provider \u2014 meaning the startup may have no choice but to change up its business.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

      "text": "Data-labeling company Scale AI confirmed on Friday that it has received a \u201csignificant\u201d investment from Meta that values the startup at $29 billion. The startup also said its co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang is stepping down from his role to join Meta and help the bigger company with its AI work.\nReports indicate that Meta invested about $14.3 billion for a 49% stake in the startup, which produces and labels data that\u2019s used to train the large language models that underpin a significant portion of generative AI development.\nMeta confirmed the investment. \u201cMeta has finalized our strategic partnership and investment in Scale AI. As part of this, we will deepen the work we do together producing data for AI models and Alexandr Wang will join Meta to work on our superintelligence efforts. We will share more about this effort and the great people joining this team in the coming weeks,\u201d a spokesperson for Meta told TechCrunch.\nJason Droege, Scale\u2019s current chief strategy officer, will hop in as interim CEO. Scale AI noted that Meta\u2019s investment will be used to pay investors and shareholders, as well as to fuel growth. The company emphasized that it remains an independent entity. Wang will continue at the data-labeling firm as a director on its board.\nAs my colleague Max Zeff wrote on Wednesday, this investment is a way for Meta to improve its AI efforts as its rivals Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic rush ahead, and the social media company\u2019s own AI model releases trail the competition. Plus, according to data by SingalFire, the company lost 4.3% of its top talent to other AI labs last year.\nFor the last several years, leading AI labs such as OpenAI have relied on Scale AI to produce and label data that\u2019s used to train models. In recent months, Scale AI and its data annotation competitors have started hiring highly skilled people, such as PhD scientists and senior software engineers, to generate high-quality data for frontier AI labs.\nScale AI raised $1 billion last year from investors including Amazon and Meta at a valuation of $13.8 billion."
