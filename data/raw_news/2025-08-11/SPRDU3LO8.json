  "content": "SpaceX is taking the rare step of slashing Starlink's monthly fee in its latest effort to attract new customers in the US.\n\nIn certain locations, new customers can now sign up for the Residential plan for $99 per month, down from $120. New customers can also get a discount on the Residential Lite plan, which drops from $80 per month to $65.\n\n\u201cOffer is valid for new customers only. Discount will apply to one service line,\u201d SpaceX says. \"The service promotional offering varies by location. Other terms and conditions may apply. Terms and duration are subject to change.\"\n\nAnother important condition is that the discount only lasts for the first year of service. After that, the normal monthly fee will kick in, according to a Starlink support page.\n\nSpaceX hasn\u2019t clearly said where the discount is being offered. But it appears to be available in over two dozen US states where Starlink has excess capacity and offers Residential Lite.\n\nThis comes after Starlink.com started offering eligible new sign-ups in the US a free Starlink dish , which usually costs $349. In return, interested customers had to subscribe for 12 months.\n\nAlthough SpaceX wound down the free dish offer, the company has returned with this service discount, an apparent first. The deal means that over 12 months, a Residential plan subscriber will save $252; a Residential Lite user will save $180.\n\nOn the downside, interested new customers will need to pay for the standard Starlink dish rather than receive it for free. However, the company has decided to discount the hardware nationwide from $349 to $175. The offer is available via Starlink.com, Walmart, and Best Buy .\n\nSpaceX recently revealed that Starlink\u2019s customer base in the US has grown to over 2 million, up from 1.4 million a year ago. Outside the US, the company has been spotted offering the same discount on the monthly fee in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.",

He developed good sources and did plenty of in-person \"shoe leather\" reporting to keep ahead of developments with major players such as Alibaba, and Xiaomi when it first started to break out. He travelled to manufacturing centers to do first-hand reporting on labor issues in the electronics supply chain, and proved to have a talent for both photography and video. Michael is also an unfailingly nice guy to work with, responsive to suggestions and feedback, and helpful to his colleagues as a collaborator.
