  "description": "Find out why this expert investor cites inflation and rising inflation as primary investing risks for 2025, and what you can do about it.",
  "content": "The S&P 500 is up more than 9% this year, but there are many reasons to believe that could change. The U.S. President is attempting to influence the Fed, the job market has slowed and business and consumers are adjusting to a new tariff reality with unknown economic consequences.\n\nAmid the uncertainty, Ayako Yoshioka, portfolio consulting director at Wealth Enhancement cited two familiar concerns\u2014higher inflation and accelerating unemployment\u2014as primary risks for investors as 2025 heads to a close. She also shared key investing moves to prepare for what lies ahead.\n\nInflation, in terms of changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), has been above the Fed\u2019s 2% target since March 2021. The inflation rate peaked at 9.1% in June 2022 before slowly pulling back to the current level of 2.7%.\n\nNew U.S. tariffs have not yet been linked to major price increases. However, the highest tariffs were implemented in August, and inflation data is only available through July. As Yoshioka pointed out, there is a risk that inflation numbers will rise as corporations begin to pass along their increased costs. An inflation uptick will tighten household budgets and, worse, could dampen consumer spending.\n\n\u201cConsumers are already fatigued after several years of higher prices and economic activity can soften further as consumers pull back,\u201d Yoshioka explained.\n\nThe unemployment rate as of July was 4.2%. This metric has remained at 4% or higher since May 2024, after staying below 4% for most of 2022 and all of 2023.\n\nWhile the unemployment rate hasn\u2019t changed dramatically, the rate of new jobs has slowed significantly. The economy added 106,000 jobs between May and July after adding 380,000 in February through March.\n\nYoshioka notes, \u201cthe softening labor market can also dampen economic growth, bringing stagflation concerns back to the forefront.\u201d\n\nStagflation is an economic cycle characterized by slow growth, rising unemployment and rising prices. This combination of factors is difficult to address with monetary policy, because higher interest rates can slow inflation but worsen a weak job market. Lower interest rates do the opposite, stimulating jobs while encouraging higher prices.\n\nYoshioka recommended diversifying into international stocks and inflation hedges, such as commodities, precious metals and real assets. She also says, \u201cmaintaining duration flexibility in fixed income can help mitigate issues from rate volatility.\u201d In other words, be open to lower-yielding, short-term bonds.\n\nPrice sensitivity is the primary issue for bonds when interest rates are changing. Bonds can lose value when interest rates rise and gain value when interest rates fall. Duration\u2014or how long it takes for the bond to mature\u2014affects how reactive the bond is to interest rate adjustments. Bonds that mature quickly are less price sensitive, and often yield less as a result.\n\nETFs offer an easy path to diversify into international stocks, commodities and other inflation hedges as well as short-term bonds. Popular funds in these categories, as measured by assets under management, include:\n\u2022 Commodities: Invesco Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy No K-1 ETF (PBDC) invests in commodity-linked futures, providing exposure to a range of heavily traded commodities.\n\u2022 Real estate: Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ) invests in companies that own and operate real estate. These companies earn rents and benefit when their properties appreciate.\n\u2022 Short-term bond maturities: iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) invests in short-term debt issued by the U.S. government.\n\nBe ready for anything\n\nDiversification is the trusted strategy for managing through uncertain economic times. Well-rounded portfolios are less volatile because each asset type responds differently to macroeconomic conditions. Those varying responses often have an offsetting effect that shaves off the most extreme edges of the group\u2019s volatility.\n\nSo, get diversified. The end of 2025 could be tumultuous, and it pays to be ready.",

      "text": "The financial headlines of 2025 have been heavy with three words: tariffs, stagflation and recession. Although the Trump administration has negotiated a tariff deal with China, the levies on imported goods remain higher than a year ago. The U.S. economy will have to adjust\u2014which means stagflation and recession are still on the table.\nLet's break down the differences between stagflation and recession, including how each impacts the workforce, the economy and the middle class.\nWhat Is Stagflation?\nStagflation is an economic cycle marked by high inflation, high unemployment and sluggish economic growth\u2014an uncommon combination of circumstances. Normally, if the economy grows quickly, unemployment declines and prices can rise. Or, if the economy slows, unemployment rises and inflation moderates. It is rare for unemployment to be high while prices are rising.\nThe last period of stagflation in the U.S. was in the 1970s. It arose from a combination of factors, the most significant being an oil crisis that drove fuel prices higher and prompted rationing. Unhealthy levels of inflation, unemployment and economic growth persisted from 1970 to 1985.\nWhat Is a Recession?\nA recession is a prolonged period of negative economic growth, usually at least two quarters or six months. Economic growth is most easily measured by quarterly changes in Gross Domestic Product or GDP. GDP is the value of all produced goods and services.\nRising unemployment, reduced consumer spending, lower business profits and shrinking GDP characterize recessions. Inflation is not a factor in a normal recession because the reduced spending and economic production cannot support rising prices.\nStagflation Vs. Recession\nStagflation features rising prices and slow economic growth, while a recession demonstrates stable prices with negative economic growth.\nStagflation\n- Economic growth: Slow\n- Unemployment: High\n- Inflation: High\nRecession\n- Economic growth: Negative\n- Unemployment: High\n- Inflation: Low\nThe presence of inflation makes stagflation harder to fix than a recession. The Fed can pull levers to stifle inflation, but these same levers slow economic growth. The opposite is also true. The Fed can stimulate the economy, but these actions will encourage inflation. In other words, there is no straightforward solution for controlling inflation while stimulating the economy.\nThe Fed finally corrected the stagflation that began in the 1970s by prioritizing inflation control. In 1980, the central bank raised the fed funds rate to 20% to combat 12.5% inflation. The U.S. fell sharply into a recession, marked by a 1.8% GDP decline in 1982. In the same year, inflation fell to 3.8%\u2014its lowest level in a decade.\nImpact On The Economy\nIn stagflation periods, the economy can keep growing, but at a slower pace. During a recession, the economy shrinks. Both scenarios can lead to:\n- Loss of consumer confidence.\n- Decline in consumer and business spending.\n- Reduction in business profits and volatility in the stock market.\n- Limited financial opportunity due to a weak job market.\nImpact On The Workforce\nThe U.S. unemployment rate has been below 4.5% since October 2021. The metric spiked to 14.8% in April 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdowns. The steep rise in unemployment coincided with a severe, but short, recession.\nA similar pattern occurred in the 2009 recession. U.S. GDP fell 2.58% and unemployment rose to 10%.\nIn the stagflation era, unemployment peaked at 10.8% during the 1982 recession.\nThe outcomes of rising unemployment include:\n- Slower salary growth.\n- Fewer opportunities to earn a promotion or move laterally.\n- Less flexible working conditions.\n- Fewer entry-level jobs for college graduates.\n- Loss of income due to layoffs and furloughs.\n- Reduced job security.\nImpact On The Middle Class\nPew Research Center defines the U.S. middle class as three-person households earning $61,000 to $183,000 annually. For this group, stagflation can lead to:\n- Higher cost of living. Budgets will be strained, and discretionary spending will decline. Families will take fewer or cheaper vacations and delay major purchases.\n- Lower income. Layoffs, furloughs and a declining business outlook may reduce household income.\n- Higher debt balances. It will be harder to pay down debt in the face of rising interest rates and tighter budgets.\n- Lower savings balances. Some households may have to rely on savings to cover lost income. Investment accounts could lose value.\nIf stagflation deepens into recession, the chances of income loss increase and the timeline for economic recovery lengthens. Some middle-class households could fall behind on mortgage and car payments, spend their savings and end up in bankruptcy.\nWhich Is Worse: Stagflation or Recession\nStagflation can be a bigger problem than recession because:\n- High inflation undermines investment returns and budgets, for consumers and businesses. These issues are more difficult to manage when financial opportunity is limited due to a weak economy.\n- Correcting stagflation may require pushing the economy into recession intentionally to control inflation.\nThe last time stagflation descended on the U.S. economy, the solution was 20% interest rates and a steep recession. Repeating that story would be a worst-case scenario for U.S. households.\nFamilies will struggle to hold their income steady as prices and debt costs rise dramatically. Those who work in cyclical industries, lack ample savings and carry high debt balances are most at risk."

The result is the difference between the two CPIs. Divide this number by the CPI for the previous year, then multiply by 100 and add a percentage sign to obtain the inflation rate for the given month.\nFor example, to calculate the inflation rate for January 2017, subtract the January 2016 CPI of 236.916 from the January 2017 CPI of 242.839, which yields 5.923. Divide 5.923 by 236.916, multiply by 100, and add a % sign to obtain an inflation rate of 2.5% for January 2017.\nChart: Monthly Inflation Rates and Annual Inflation Rates in the United States\nThe following chart displays both the monthly inflation rates alongside the 12-month inflation rates since January 2015.

      "text": "An S&P 500 ETF may have been your first investing pick, but it shouldn\u2019t be your last. While the large-cap S&P 500 index has made its share of millionaires, it is increasingly dominated by only a few companies. The top 10 S&P 500 stocks comprise nearly 38% of the index, while the remaining 62% is split among 490 companies.\nDiversifying outside the S&P 500 reduces concentration risk and provides other avenues of growth beyond Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). The funds introduced here can achieve both goals. Read on to meet the largest and most popular funds in market segments that have little to no overlap with the S&P 500.\n6 Top ETFs to Buy to Diversify Beyond the S&P 500\nThe table below identifies the six best ETFs to buy to diversify beyond the S&P 500. A closer review of each fund follows.\nMetrics for current share prices and distribution yields are sourced from stockanalysis.com. Returns, composition metrics, expense ratios and net asset values are from fund websites.\n1. iShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF (IJR)\nIJR by the numbers:\n- Share price: $113.84\n- Expense ratio: 0.06%\n- 1-year return: 4.5%\n- 5-year return: 11.6%\n- Yield: 1.6%\n- Number of holdings: 632\niShares Core S&P Small-Cap ETF Overview\nIJR invests in small-cap stocks, which have market capitalizations ranging from $250 million to $2 billion. The fund's largest industry exposures are financials (19.5%), industrials (19.3%) and consumer discretionary (13.9%). The top three holdings are loan servicer Mr. Cooper, aerospace technology provider Kratos Defense & Security and rare minerals producer MP Materials.\nWhy IJR Can Help Diversify\nIJR has zero overlap with the S&P 500. With 632 holdings, the fund is also well-diversified within the small-cap segment.\nSome analysts are bullish on small caps for 2025, citing appealing valuations, a positive regulatory environment and increasing merger and acquisition activity. Small caps are also likely to have lower tariff risk, since they normally focus on domestic business for growth.\nSmall caps can be volatile, so most investors will not use IJR as a core fund. A reasonable starting allocation would be 5% to 15%.\n2. iShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF (IJH)\nIJH by the numbers:\n- Share price: $63.38\n- Expense ratio: 0.05%\n- 1-year return: 7.5%\n- 5-year return: 13.4%\n- Yield: 2.1%\n- Number of holdings: 404\niShares Core S&P Mid-Cap ETF Overview\nIJH invests in mid-cap companies, which have market values of $2 billion to $10 billion. Similar to IJR, the portfolio favors industrials (23.7%), financials (18%) and consumer discretionary (13.3%) stocks. The top three holdings are digital investment broker Interactive Brokers Group, construction service provider Emcor Group and HVAC contractor Comfort Systems USA.\nWhy IJH Can Help Diversify\nNone of the 404 stocks in the IJH portfolio are in the S&P 500. Information technology, the sector that dominates the S&P 500, comprises just 11.9% of IJH.\nThe 2025 outlook for mid caps is also positive, for the same reasons small caps are poised to shine. However, mid caps are larger and more established than small caps. Their larger size may provide better business visibility, financial resilience and capital access relative to their smaller counterparts.\nA 5% to 15% allocation to mid caps is appropriate for many investors. You might lean to the higher side of the range if you decide to forgo small-cap exposure.\n3. Vanguard Real Estate ETF (VNQ)\nVNQ by the numbers:\n- Share price: $90.49\n- Expense ratio: 0.13%\n- 1-year return: 2.4%\n- 5-year return: 5.8%\n- Yield: 3.8%\n- Number of holdings: 155\nVanguard Real Estate ETF Overview\nVanguard\u2019s real estate ETF invests in real estate investment trusts (REIT). REITs are companies that own and manage real estate. They pay no corporate taxes and distribute 90% of their taxable income to shareholders.\nVNQ's primary exposures are to property owners in health care (13.7%), retail (13.2%) and telecom towers (11.50%). The top three holdings are Vanguard's institutional real estate fund VRTPX, senior housing operator Welltower and industrial property owner Prologis.\nWhy VNQ Can Help Diversify\nThirty-one of VNQ\u2019s 160 holdings are in the S&P 500, including Welltower and Prologis. In terms of weight, the overlap is low. For example, Welltower is 6.1% of VNQ but only 0.2% of the S&P 500.\nREITs make their money on real estate values and rents, two values that generally hold up well in inflationary periods. So it\u2019s not surprising that a 2022 analysis by industry group NAREIT concluded that REITs outperform the S&P 500 in high-inflation periods. This means VNQ exposure could partly offset the next inflation-related downturn in stocks.\nREITs should be a non-core holding with an allocation of 5% to 15%.\n4. Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS)\nVXUS by the numbers:\n- Share price: $71.47\n- Expense ratio: 0.05%\n- 1-year return: 14.2%\n- 5-year return: 9.3%\n- Yield: 2.7%\n- Number of holdings: 8,615\nVanguard Total International Stock ETF Overview\nVXUS invests in small-, mid- and large-cap stocks located outside the U.S., with exposure to Europe (39%), emerging markets (27.2%), the Pacific (25.4%) and North America (7.7%). The top holdings are chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor, online advertising and content company Tencent Holdings and enterprise software provider SAP.\nWhy VXUS Can Help Diversify\nVXUS has no overlap with the S&P 500. Finance is the most heavily weighted sector in VXUS, while the S&P 500 is concentrated in technology.\nVXUS has outperformed S&P 500 ETFs this year, notching a 22.7% gain vs. 10.4% for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. Schwab is upbeat about international stocks for the remainder of 2025, partly due to their attractive valuations and weakness in the U.S. dollar.\nInternational stocks can comprise 20% to 30% of your portfolio.\n5. Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)\nBND by the numbers:\n- Share price: $73.53\n- Expense ratio: 0.03%\n- 1-year return: 3.4%\n- 5-year return: -1.1%\n- Yield: 3.8%\n- Number of holdings: 11,402\nVanguard Total Bond Market ETF Overview\nBND invests in taxable, investment-grade bonds issued in U.S. dollars. About 80% of the portfolio has maturities ranging from one to 10 years, and the portfolio may be moderately price-sensitive to interest rates. Bond types include Treasury securities (48.9%), government mortgage-backed securities (19.6%) and corporate industrial bonds (14.4%).\nWhy BND Can Help Diversify\nBND provides broad exposure to the U.S. bond market, which can add stability and income to a portfolio otherwise focused on the S&P 500. Bonds can fluctuate in value, but they\u2019re generally less reactive than stock prices. They can also move in the opposite direction of stocks, rising when investors sour on equities.\nThe right bond allocation depends on your risk tolerance and investment goals. If your goal is to preserve your wealth\u2014say, because you are retired\u2014you might want 40% to 60% exposure to bonds. If you're young and interested in long-term growth, a 10% to 20% allocation is more appropriate.\n6. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD)\nGLD by the numbers:\n- Investment focus: Gold\n- Share price: $308.09\n- Expense ratio: 0.40%\n- 1-year return: 35.4%\n- 5-year return: 10.5%\n- Yield: NA\n- Number of holdings: 1\nSPDR Gold Shares Fund Overview\nGLD invests in physical gold bullion. Shareholders participate in gold spot price changes, less fund expenses, without having to buy, store and insure their own gold bars.\nWhy GLD Can Help Diversify\nGold is a safe-haven asset that tends to appreciate during periods of high inflation and economic uncertainty\u2014circumstances that often coincide with stock price declines.\nThe precious metal has performed very well recently, increasing more than 35% over the last 12 months. Some analysts believe the run will continue. In June 2025, J.P. Morgan predicted gold\u2019s price could reach $3,675 per ounce in the fourth quarter and nearly $4,000 in mid-2026. Gold futures contracts currently trade just below $3,400.\nAccording to State Street Global Advisors, 83% of advisors recommend a gold allocation of 10% or more. Surveyed high-net-worth investors had an average gold allocation of 21% in 2024.\nBottom Line\nThe S&P 500 has made headlines for its performance in recent years, but it's not the only game in town. Adding small- and mid-caps, international stocks, REITs, bonds or gold to your portfolio provides multiple pathways to growth, plus some cushion if large caps weaken.

      "text": "Inflation is a top concern among individual investors, according to a recent survey by Natixis Investment Managers. Half (50%) of investors cited inflation as their top investment concern and 51% rated it their top financial fear.\nAs the August 1 reinstatement of reciprocal tariffs approaches, it's a good time to refresh what you know about inflation, how it affects your wealth and strategies for protecting yourself.\nInflation Basics\nInflation is a rise in average prices. As prices go up, the purchasing power of the dollar declines. In other words, with higher prices you need more money to buy the same amount of goods. Here are some useful inflation facts to know:\n- Inflation is measured primarily by the Consumer Price Index or CPI.\n- The Bureau of Labor Statistics publishes the CPI data monthly to track how prices for a range of goods and services changes over time.\n- In the U.S., the target inflation rate is 2%. The Federal Reserve manages interest rates and the money supply to manage inflation and promote maximum employment.\n- Since September 2021, inflation in the U.S. has ranged from 9.06% in June, 2022 to 2.31% in April, 2025.\n- The latest inflation reading for June was 2.67%. This means prices in June were 2.67% higher than 12 months earlier.\nInflation's Effect On Investments\nInflation reduces the benefits of investment returns. If you think of wealth as the amount of purchasing power you have, inflation and investing are opposing forces. This is why investors commonly review their inflation-adjusted returns\u2014because that value represents a truer representation of the wealth created through investing.\nThe formula for inflation-adjusted return is: [(1+investment return)/(1+inflation rate)]-1. If your account grew 12% while the inflation rate was 2.5%, your inflation-adjusted return was 9.3%. You can also simply subtract the inflation rate from your investment return for a less accurate, but simpler calculation. In this case, this shorter formula is 12% minus 2.5%, or 9.5%.\nInflation Management Strategies\nNormal inflation is usually manageable when you are working\u2014because you should get an annual pay raise that helps you adjust to higher prices.\nInflation becomes less manageable when it spikes or remains elevated for an extended period. The more extreme inflation cycles are particularly challenging for fixed-income families and retirees, but even working folk will see inflation stretching their budget.\nThree core strategies can help you manage the effects of inflation: increase income or lower expenses, diversify your portfolio and trim excess costs from your investing program.\nIncrease Your Income (Or Lower Expenses)\nAs several sources have reported, new tariffs going into effect next month could result in noticeable price increases on everyday goods. Any increases have a range of potential downstream effects on consumer spending, corporate profits and investment returns. Still, the most immediate problem you may see is a tighter budget. And running short on grocery money can be more concerning than what\u2019s happening in your retirement account.\nTo manage a near-term inflation spike, you can increase your income or lower your spending. The more you widen the gap between when you make and what you spend, the more cushion you have to absorb higher costs on coffee, clothing, appliances and home hardware. Ideas to consider include:\n- Temporarily reducing your discretionary spending: Take cheaper vacations, buy fewer clothes, eat out less.\n- Ask for a raise, promotion or more hours.\n- Pick up some gig work.\nDiversify Into Inflation-Hedging Investments\nStocks hold up well against inflation over the long-term, but they can be volatile during periods of high inflation. You can soften the worst edges of the volatility by adding some investments that perform well under the stress of inflation. Options include:\n- Inflation-protected bond funds. Funds like SPDR Portfolio TIPS ETF (SPIP) and iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP) hold bonds whose principal value goes up and down with changes in the CPI.\n- REITs. Real estate values and rents tend to rise in inflationary times. According to REIT association Nareit, REIT dividends rose faster than inflation in all but two of the last 20 years.\n- Commodity funds. Commodity prices also go up with inflation. You can choose from funds that invest in precious metals, oil or agricultural products. Precious metal funds tend to be the simplest to understand.\n- Dividend Aristocrats. Dividend Aristocrats are stocks that have increased their annual dividends for 25 consecutive years. In inflationary times, they are often less volatile than growth stocks. Even better, the rising income can ease inflation pressures in retirement, when you are no longer receiving an annual pay raise.\nGet Tax Efficient And Trim Fees\nYou can also boost your inflation-adjusted investment returns indirectly\u2014by minimizing other costs that dilute performance. Two to evaluate are your taxes and investment fees.\n- Taxes: Make sure you are maximizing your available retirement account contributions before investing in taxable accounts. If you are investing in tax-advantaged and taxable accounts, look to optimize your holdings for maximum tax efficiency. Keep income-paying securities in the tax-advantaged accounts and hold long-term growth stocks in the taxable account.\n- Investment fees: You may be paying several layers of fees to invest. Funds charge expense ratios and sales fees to shareholders. Investing accounts charge administrative fees. Financial advisors charge management fees. Some of these fees are avoidable and others are not. For example, an avoidable fee is a high expense ratio on a fund when a similar fund charges a much lower expense ratio. Review the fees you\u2019re paying and plan on phasing out the unnecessary ones.\nA Long-Term Inflation Strategy\nInflation is a concern in 2025. However, managing the wealth effects of inflation shouldn\u2019t be a short-term or temporary effort. A better strategy is to incorporate inflation protection into a diversified portfolio you can hold indefinitely. Under this approach, you won't be moving in and out of inflation hedges\u2014which lowers the risk of mistiming trades.\nRemember, too, that inflation can become more challenging as you age. Your future self will appreciate the work you do now to add inflation resistance to your portfolio."

      "text": "When the person in charge of the U.S. money supply predicts rising unemployment and inflation, people listen. Unemployment combined with inflation is an economic phenomenon known as stagflation. It is destructive, challenging to manage and rare.\nFind out who\u2019s concerned about stagflation, what's driving the worry, how you might be affected, and what you can do to prepare.\nWho's Talking About Stagflation And Why?\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell made this prediction at an economic event in Chicago on April 15, according to The Telegraph: \"So unemployment is likely to go up as the economy slows in all likelihood and inflation is likely to go up as tariffs find their way and some part of those tariffs come to be paid by the public.\"\nPowell leads the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the U.S. Known informally as the Fed, the central bank manages the U.S. monetary policy and regulates banks. The monetary policy has two goals: stable prices and maximum employment. The Fed pursues those goals by adjusting interest rates, buying or selling bonds on the open market and fine-tuning how much cash banks must hold as reserves.\nChanging Tariff Policy\nWhen Powell predicted rising unemployment and higher prices\u2014the two components of stagflation\u2014he cited U.S. tariffs as instigating factors. U.S. President Donald Trump has initiated, paused, restarted and raised tariffs since taking office. Tariffs in place when Powell spoke last week included:\n- A 10% universal tariff on all imported goods.\n- Up to 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico.\n- Up to 245% tariffs on China.\nTariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods. Importers pay the taxes when the goods arrive at a U.S. port.\nTariffs can have positive and negative effects on an economy. One positive is a potential reduction in foreign competition, which should create jobs in the U.S. But tariffs also raise costs for businesses, encouraging labor cutbacks and higher prices. Higher prices can stifle consumer spending, which slows economic growth.\nMore concerning is that tariffs can prompt other countries to raise taxes on U.S. exports. These retaliatory actions may offset any benefit from the initial tariff.\nPowell is not the only one predicting Trump\u2019s tariffs will raise unemployment and prices. According to Fox Business, an analysis from Goldman Sachs concludes that Trump\u2019s tariffs will negatively affect the overall U.S. job market. The Yale Budget Lab estimates prices will rise an average of 3% in the short term, with increases up to 87% on shoes and apparel.\nHow Does Stagflation Affect Consumers?\nStagflation is uncommon. It last hit the U.S. in the 1970s after a cutback in oil production outside the U.S. prompted then-President Richard Nixon to ration fuel, Yale\u2019s Energy History Online explains. The economy slowed, the labor market shrank and prices rose.\nIn those days, people quantified the declining state of the economy by summing the inflation rate and the unemployment rate, a value called the Misery Index. In 1969, the Misery Index was 8.95. It eclipsed 17 in 1975 and 20 in 1980. By comparison, the Misery Index today is 6.6, with inflation at 2.4% and unemployment at 4.2%.\nA rising Misery Index could create a range of difficulties, such as:\n- Your budget will no longer cover expenses. You'll have to spend more to get the same quantity of food, clothes and gas.\n- Your chances of getting laid off or working fewer hours will increase.\n- Employers will demand more from you as teams shrink and work gets redistributed among fewer people.\n- Fewer job opportunities will be available. Lateral or promotional moves to improve your career path, work-life balance or income may not be possible.\n- College graduates will be challenged to find opportunities in their field.\n- Loans for cars and homes will get more expensive.\n- Interest charges on credit cards and other variable debts will increase.\nWhat Fixes Stagflation?\nStagflation is scary in part because it\u2019s hard to fix. The remedy for inflation is to slow the economy by raising interest rates. However, a slowing economy usually creates more unemployment. Efforts to stimulate the economy have the opposite trade-off. They may help with jobs but they will encourage higher prices.\nThe Fed tried both strategies in the 1970s, explains its history website, first prioritizing jobs and then working to manage inflation. Attacking inflation with higher interest rates, while accepting the negative impact on employment, proved the better strategy.\nStill, the recovery was slow. The Misery Index remained above 11 from 1973 to 1984.\nHow To Prepare For Stagflation\nSolid finances plus valued job skills help you manage rising prices and a tough labor market. Try these strategies:\n- Evaluate your job role. Some jobs and industries experience more layoffs than others when the economy slows. Manufacturing and construction jobs are examples. Evaluate how sensitive your job might be to an economic downturn. Consider outside training that could help you switch to a more stable role.\n- Make yourself indispensable at work. Volunteer for opportunities to take on more responsibility. Show your willingness to learn and grow. Seek out a mentor at your company or in your industry. Ask your boss how you can improve your skills and follow the advice.\n- Cut back on spending. Try a temporary freeze on discretionary spending. This exercise builds your discipline and helps you understand how much you can cut back if your income changes. You can also set goals to spend less on essential purchases, such as groceries.\n- Pay down debt or hoard your cash. Your spending cuts should free up cash. Use that cash to pay down high-rate debt. Or, stash the money in a high-yield savings account. Lower monthly interest charges benefit your budget, while an emergency cash fund can prevent more debt if lose your job.\n- Stop charging. Say no to any credit card purchases. If you can\u2019t pay for it with cash, don't buy it.\nThe more time you spend on these strategies, the better results you will see. Ideally, you would keep at it until your job is secure, your credit card debt is repaid and you have an ample emergency fund. At that point, you can soften your spending restrictions\u2014just don't abandon them, or you will have to repeat the hard work again in the future.\nIf stagflation doesn\u2019t materialize, even better. You\u2019ll be financially strong and have the skills to reach your biggest financial goals."
