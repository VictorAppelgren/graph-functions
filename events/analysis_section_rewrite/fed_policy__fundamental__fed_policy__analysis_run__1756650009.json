      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid first‑pass but it fails the core acceptance gate because it does **not map to a canonical handle** (e.g., ust10y, dxy, spx, gold, etc.) and it contains **no explicit catalyst window**. To lift it to world‑class quality, do the following: 1) **Anchor the analysis to a canonical handle** – mortgage rates can be expressed as a function of the 10‑year Treasury yield (ust10y) and the Fed policy rate. 2) **Introduce a clear catalyst window** – e.g., “Fed policy meeting on 16‑17 Sept 2025” or “inflation expectations shift in Q3 2025” with a sign (+) and magnitude range (e.g., +25 bp to 30 bp). 3) **Embed first‑principles anchors** – explicitly state the real‑rate differential (US‑Eurozone ≈ 0.5‑1.0 %) and the term‑premium dynamics driven by the Fed’s balance‑sheet contraction. 4) **Quantify the causal chain** – show how a 25 bp Fed cut → 10‑year yield drop of 15‑20 bp → 30‑year mortgage rate decline of 10‑15 bp. 5) **Add multiple citations** – reference the mortgage‑rate data (ID LF0UUL917), Fed policy minutes (e.g., ID 1ZRJSOWD9 for policy context), and Treasury yield data (e.g., ID 1ZRJSOWD9 or a new source). 6) **State transition conditions** – e.g., “if CPI falls below 2 % for two consecutive quarters → Fed cuts → mortgage rates fall to 6.5‑6.7 %.” 7) **Provide a confidence rating** – e.g., “moderate‑high (70 %) given the Fed’s clear stance but sensitive to MBS liquidity shocks.” 8) **Ensure every claim has a source** – avoid generic statements; use the IDs above. Once these edits are made, the piece will satisfy the acceptance gate and align with the multi‑year structural focus.",
