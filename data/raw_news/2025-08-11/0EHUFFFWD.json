  "content": "Once battered AI stock surges 43% after earnings originally appeared on TheStreet.\n\nSoundHound AI, the once hot stock during Nvidia\u2019s backing but later slumping after the chipmaker exited, is regaining momentum.\n\nIn the two trading sessions, SoundHound AI (SOUN) stock gained more than 43% after a record earnings release. The stock surged 17.3% on Aug. 11, following another 26.4% gain on Aug. 8.\n\nStill, the stock remains 34% below its December peak and is down roughly 20% so far this year.\n\nIn early 2024, Nvidia (NVDA) disclosed an investment of $3.7 million in SoundHound. But in February, the AI-chip giant disclosed that it had sold all its shares, causing SoundHound to slump 28% on Feb. 14.\n\nNow, Wall Street is taking another look at the stock\u2019s potential, even without Nvidia\u2019s backing.\n\nSoundHound AI develops voice technology that helps businesses build their own assistants. Its system combines voice recognition with conversational AI to achieve interactions between humans and AI models.\n\nVoice assistants like Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant have been part of daily life for over a decade, answering questions, setting reminders, and controlling smart devices.\n\nBut they\u2019ve always come with a trade-off for companies that wanted to use them, as they had to stay within big tech\u2019s walls, forcing companies to give up control over branding and user data.\n\nFounded in Santa Clara, California, SoundHound now builds white-label voice AI that lets businesses create their own custom assistants. Clients include Mercedes-Benz, IHG Hotels, and Spotify.\n\nThe voice AI market is booming, projected to grow nearly 30% annually from 2024 to 2030, according to Grand View Research. SoundHound\u2019s latest earnings show it\u2019s growing even faster.\n\nThe company's revenue for the second quarter rose 217% year over year to $43 million, reaching an all-time high and above expectations of $33 million. This was driven by new wins and product cross-selling across customers.\n\n\u201cWe are moving with speed to capture the explosion we\u2019re seeing in the voice and conversational AI industry,\u201d CFO Nitesh Sharan said in a statement.\n\nStill, SoundHound is not yet profitable. Its second-quarter adjusted loss per share was 3 cents, better than the expected loss per share of 5 cents.\n\nSoundHound has raised its full-year outlook to $160 million to $178 million, with the midpoint above the $164 million consensus estimate from FactSet.",

Traditionally, GPUs were used to enhance the experience on computing platforms, most notably in gaming applications on PCs. GPU use cases have since emerged as important semiconductors used in artificial intelligence. Nvidia not only offers AI GPUs, but also a software platform, Cuda, used for AI model development and training. Nvidia is also expanding its data center networking solutions, helping to tie GPUs together to handle complex workloads.\nRatingPrice TargetMorningstar | A Weekly Summary of Stock Ideas and Developments in the Companies We Cover\nIn this edition, who does 'anti-involution' benefit in greater China markets?; powering tomorrow's data centers critical; and innovations benefit 'forgotten' tricuspid valve; and BASF, Publicis, and Charles Schwab.\nMorningstar | A Weekly Summary of Stock Ideas and Developments in the Companies We Cover\nIn this edition, who does 'anti-involution' benefit in greater China markets?; powering tomorrow's data centers critical; and innovations benefit 'forgotten' tricuspid valve; and BASF, Publicis, and Charles Schwab.\nUnderstanding AI Growth Opportunities\nWe expect S&P earnings to grow 9% this year and we like companies that increase their dividends at a 10%-plus rate. How does the AI marketplace stack up against those metrics? Pretty well. Argus has derived a model of the size and scope of the global AI industry, based on our coverage of major publicly traded players and most of the mid-tier players, as well as our industry knowledge of private players. We estimate the global AI industry annual revenue amounted to $250 billion in 2024, and expect that to grow at a 40% CAGR through 2030, when total revenue is forecast to reach $1.8 trillion. The emergence of China's DeepSeek caused a broad selloff in AI stocks earlier this year, a reminder that this space is dynamic. DeepSeek reportedly is inexpensive and powerful. While pricing is important, companies in the AI space prioritize relationships, continuity, security, and reliability. The top priority for companies using AI delivered as-a-service across cloud is to ensure that delivery is secure, low latency (fast), and reliable. Adding new vendors always entails risk that these requirements will not be met. U.S. government policy will likely prevent wide dissemination of Chinese Large Language Models (LLMs) in enterprise technology implementations in the U.S., given risks of \"back doors\" to Chinese military and intelligence. Non-U.S. nations are largely following similar policies. Finally, AI hardware leaders offer GPU software libraries, model training, and inference services tailored to specific enterprise AI applications. The AI market is large and growing, and new entrants are expected to disrupt the market.\nTop Analysts: NVDA\nView MoreOverall Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest for NVDA overall weighted by direction, price target, and price movement.\nLearn MoreDirection Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest on predicting the directional movement of NVDA.\nLearn MorePrice Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest on predicting the price target of NVDA.\nLearn More"
