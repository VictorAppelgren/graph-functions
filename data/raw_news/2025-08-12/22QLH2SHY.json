  "title": "Chargers' receiver Ladd McConkey can finally learn from Keenan Allen in person",
  "description": "As a rookie, Ladd McConkey studied film of Keenan Allen. Now that they are both on the Chargers, he can learn directly.",
  "content": "Even before Keenan Allen returned to the Chargers last week, he was already making an impact in the receiver room.\n\nAs a rookie, Ladd McConkey studied Allen\u2019s practice film on his team-issued iPad, trying to absorb lessons from one of the league\u2019s best route runners \u2014 the very player whose rookie records for receptions and receiving yards McConkey would eventually surpass.\n\n\u201cYou sit in team meetings, pull up your iPad and just watch,\u201d McConkey said. \u201cWatching his one-on-one stuff from previous years, when he was here. I\u2019m going to check this out, see what he\u2019s got.\u201d\n\nNow, the 33-year-old Allen and 23-year-old McConkey are inseparable on the field. Throughout practice, McConkey picks the veteran\u2019s brain \u2014 something he says \u201cwould be dumb if I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been doing it at a high level for a long time, so any knowledge I can get, I\u2019m going to take it,\u201d McConkey said. \u201cHe\u2019s very decisive and smart\u2026 He knows how to win using leverage. He doesn\u2019t just run past you \u2014 he can set you up at the top, stick and he has great hands.\u201d\n\nThe prospect of the two playing in the same offense excites McConkey, who says any doubts about their chemistry can be set aside because \u201cin this offense, we can all move around.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can all rotate in different positions and scheme it up the way they want,\u201d McConkey added. \u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s really good about our receivers, and we\u2019re all very versatile.\u201d\n\nIt was the first day the two were able to participate in the same 11-on-11 session, with McConkey returning from an undisclosed injury that sidelined him for several practices and Allen just coming back last week.\n\nOffensive coordinator Greg Roman said Allen\u2019s presence has already made a difference, noting, \u201cWe always knew he was a great player, but now that he\u2019s here, he\u2019s proven it once again\u2026 Keenan creates flexibility for us and also makes us stronger.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur training staff is doing a great job acclimating him, getting him up to speed,\u201d Roman said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking it slow, in a gradual manner\u2026 Getting into football shape.\u201d\n\nAt times last season, when healthy, the Chargers rotated as many as three deep at running back.\n\nWith Najee Harris \u2014 expected back at some point \u2014 and first-round pick Omarion Hampton projected to handle the bulk of the carries, there\u2019s still an opening for a third back in Roman\u2019s system.\n\nWith Hampton sitting out Sunday\u2019s preseason game against the New Orleans Saints, plenty of reps were up for grabs. Roman called it a \u201cwide-open competition.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll definitely be a rotation no matter what happens,\u201d Roman said. \u201cWe\u2019ll try to keep guys fresh throughout the game. I think the days of one running back taking every rep are going the way of prehistoric creatures.\u201d\n\nThat leaves the spot up for grabs between second-year back Kimani Vidal \u2014 who started Sunday and finished with six carries for 16 yards \u2014 and undrafted rookie Raheim Sanders, who had 10 carries for 42 yards and a touchdown.\n\n\u201cHe [Sanders] did a great job, kind of created some things on his own,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cLeaned on the defense in the fourth quarter\u2026 A lot of it [drive] was him pounding the rock. He did a really nice job for his first game.\u201d\n\nSanders faces an uphill climb, though. Vidal is coming off a rookie season in which he worked his way from a fringe roster hopeful to contributor, making the 53-man roster and appearing in six games.\n\nAt practice, the two continue to fight for a good share of reps, with Hassan Haskins mixed in.\n\nQuarterback Trey Lance sat out full-team drills Tuesday, which Roman said was simply a rest day after Lance played most of Sunday\u2019s game \u2014 stressing it was not injury-related\u2026 Guard Mekhi Becton has now missed two full weeks of practice as he continues to \u201cwork through something.\u201d",

      "text": "Jim Harbaugh: Losing Rashawn Slater for the season \u2018like a gut punch\u2019\n- Share via\nA day after losing the cornerstone of their offensive line, the mood around the Chargers\u2019 training facility remained the same \u2014 somber.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a gut punch into the solar plexus \u2014 takes the wind out of you,\u201d coach Jim Harbaugh said. \u201cDon\u2019t really have the words or am able to think about anything else. Man, just feel bad.\u201d\nIt was the first day of moving forward with a new-look offensive line after learning Rashawn Slater ruptured his patellar tendon \u2014 an injury that will require him to undergo season-ending surgery. The Chargers placed Slater on injured reserve Saturday and signed free-agent offensive tackle David Sharpe in a corresponding move.\nEven with the need to move forward, Slater remained on everyone\u2019s mind. Harbaugh said he was confident Slater would overcome the setback.\n\u201cI also know how he\u2019ll attack the rehab and train, and he\u2019ll be back,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cNot this season, but I know he\u2019ll be back.\u201d\nChargers left tackle Rashawn Slater sustained a torn patellar tendon in his left leg and will undergo season-ending surgery, the team announces.\nFor Joe Alt \u2014 the other half of one of the best offensive tackle duos in the NFL \u2014 it was difficult to accept that the man who mentored him during his rookie season last year would not be playing in 2025.\n\u201cI\u2019m praying for him,\u201d Alt said. \u201cI know what he\u2019s going to do. I know he\u2019s going to recover and he\u2019s going to attack it and be back better than ever.\u201d\nThe mindset in the offensive line room has shifted with Slater out. They are determined to stay focused on honoring him through their play.\n\u201cWe\u2019re brothers,\u201d Alt said. \u201cYes, one fell down, and the goal is to play as well as five is one, and the only way we can do that is by moving forward and playing the best we can, to do what he would want us to do.\u201d\nTrey Pipkins III, who has moved into a potential starting role at right tackle because of the injury, said he spoke with Slater, whose \u201cspirits are as good as they can be,\u201d adding Slater was \u201cjoking around a little.\u201d\nOne day after it was reported that the NFL banned ammonia inhalants, the league clarified that while teams can no longer supply them, players can supply their own.\nSlater\u2019s absence presents an opportunity for Pipkins, who is in the final year of his contract and returning to a position he played for his first five seasons before a brief shift to guard last season.\nWhile Harbaugh said nothing is set, Pipkins \u2014 who started at right tackle in both 2022 and 2023 \u2014 will get the first look at the spot. Jamaree Salyer, who Harbaugh praised for a strong showing throughout camp, also could challenge for the starting role.\nFor now, the offensive line consists of Alt moving to left tackle, Zion Johnson at left guard, Bradley Bozeman at center, Mekhi Becton at right guard and Pipkins at right tackle, according to Harbaugh.\nWith the loss of depth on the offensive line, the team plans to explore the free-agent market and expects to bring in players for workouts Saturday before the preseason game against the New Orleans Saints on Sunday.\nKeenan Allen, who was traded away by a Chargers team desperate to get under the salary cap, returns to the team after working out for them last week.\nNajee Harris\u2019 status remains unclear\nA potential return timeline for running back Najee Harris, who has been on the non-football injury/illness list since a July 4 fireworks incident, remains unclear.\nHarris began walking laps at practice on Aug. 2, wearing a helmet with a visor and cleats, but has yet to progress further in his recovery. Harbaugh remained vague about when Harris might practice or play for the Chargers.\nWhen asked if Harris would be ready for the Chargers\u2019 season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs in Brazil \u2014 which Harris\u2019 agent, Doug Hendrickson, said he expects \u2014 Harbaugh replied, \u201cThere is a chance.\u201d\nLike with most player injury updates, Harbaugh deferred to his lack of medical expertise when asked if the injury was still just \u201csuperficial,\u201d as first reported, or something more serious.\nTwo days ago, Harris posted a photo on Snapchat showing his left eye completely shut, captioned: \u201cWE AT IT.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t comment on it because I am not a doctor,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cI\u2019m not Mr. Harris\u2019 agent, either. I\u2019m talking about what I know, and can he open his eye? Yeah. I\u2019ve looked into his eye.\u201d"

      "text": "He\u2019s back: Wide receiver Keenan Allen agrees to deal with Chargers\n- Share via\nThe Chargers are reuniting with a former franchise star to bolster their receivers unit.\nKeenan Allen, who racked up more than 10,000 receiving yards during an 11-season stint with the Chargers before being traded away in a salary-cap move, agreed to a deal with the team Tuesday.\nThe one-year deal is worth $8.52 million, according to NFL Media.\n\u201cObviously, we know how good he\u2019s been throughout his career,\u201d Chargers general manager Joe Hortiz said, \u201cand he\u2019s out there on the market still, and [it was the] chance to bring someone of his caliber back we know can help us win games.\u201d\nAllen spent last season in Chicago after the Chargers traded their then-longest tenured player to the Bears in an attempt to become salary-cap compliant after the start of free agency. He caught 70 passes for 744 yards and seven touchdowns in the Caleb Williams-led offense but was not re-signed by Chicago.\nTrey Lance shines at quarterback for the Chargers in a dominant 34-7 victory over the Detroit Lions in the Hall of Fame Game. Here\u2019s what we learned from the NFL preseason opener.\nAllen worked out with the Chargers on Friday, with coach Jim Harbaugh remarking that Allen did \u201ca lot of Keenan Allen things.\u201d Responding to a viewer on Twitch stream over the weekend, Allen said his meeting with the team \u201cwent good, man. The meeting was straight.\u201d\nAfter the sudden retirement of Mike Williams at the start of training camp, the Chargers were in need of a wide receiver, and Allen was among the top options remaining on the free-agent market. At 33, Allen\u2019s best days are probably behind him, but the six-time Pro Bowl selection proved last season he is capable of staying healthy and being productive.\nStill, the idea of signing Allen didn\u2019t materialize entirely after Williams retired.\n\u201cI think Mike leaving may have opened more opportunity, but ... Keenan was an option throughout,\u201d Hortiz said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had conversations with him and his agent ... and it kind of came to fruition.\u201d\nSecond only to Hall of Famer Antonio Gates atop the Chargers\u2019 all-time receiving yards list, Allen joins a pass-catching corps led by second-year standout Ladd McConkey and former first-round pick Quentin Johnston, who had a promising sophomore season in 2024 after struggling as a rookie.\nChargers rookie wide receiver Tre\u2019 Harris says he has a better understanding of what it takes to be a truly great NFL player after Hall of Fame visit.\nAllen will be the graybeard of a Chargers receivers group that has several promising pass-catchers. Jalen Reagor is the only receiver other than Allen on the roster with more than five years of NFL experience. Highly touted rookies Tre\u2019 Harris and KeAndre Lambert-Smith, in addition to Reagor, Derius Davis and Brenden Rice, will be competing with Allen for targets.\nAs for a potential redundancy with Ladd at slot receiver, Hortiz is confident Allen can adjust to the Chargers\u2019 needs.\n\u201cI think he can help us in multiple roles. I really believe that,\u201d Hortiz said.\u201dI think he\u2019s been that way his whole career, and don\u2019t see that being any different now. ... You guys know how Keenan has been used everywhere he\u2019s been, you\u2019ll see the same thing. A lot of versatility.\u201d\nThe wild card in all of this might rest on how well Allen can reestablish chemistry with quarterback Justin Herbert. In four seasons together, Allen caught 380 passes for 4,125 yards and 25 touchdowns.\nIf Allen can get close to the numbers he posted in 2023 (108 catches, 1,243 yards, seven touchdowns), the rest of the AFC West should be wary.\n\u201cThis is where he grew up. This is where he became Keenan Allen,\u201d Hortiz said.\nWriter Benjamin Royer contributed to this report."
