  "description": "Legendary anime artist Shinya Ohira's new episode, BLACK, is a celebration of the franchise's roots in Japanese culture.",
  "content": "Lucasfilm made its AnimeNYC debut in 2025 with a screening of \u201cBLACK\u201d, an upcoming episode of Star Wars: Visions directed by legendary anime artist Shinya Ohira (known for his work on Akira, Spirited Away, and The Animatrix). James Waugh, Lucasfilm\u2019s senior vice president of franchise content and strategy, announced that season 3 of the animated series will feature nine original anime shorts, some from Japanese studios that contributed to season 1, plus several new contributors.\n\nThis season channels the spirit of the original anthology, bringing together anime studios to explore the Star Wars franchise\u2019s Japanese influences and themes, like bushido, the feudal era, and the universal life force of qi. The first short shown to the public was \"BLACK.\" It was a glimpse of what audiences can expect when season 3 streams on Oct. 29. Polygon was in the room for the exclusive AnimeNYC preview and can confirm that TKTKTKT.\n\n\u201cBLACK\u201d is a highly experimental short from Ohira and David Production (JoJo's Bizarre Adventure), blending psychedelic visuals with minimal dialogue, and set to a jazzy Fujiwara Sakura score that evokes the vibe of Mos Eisley.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to offer a film that was mainly based on Sakura Fujiwara\u2019s singing voice set against these visuals of intense battles,\" Ohira explained in a pre-recorded video. \"That was our vision as we made the film.\"\n\n\"BLACK\" depicts a psychedelic battle taking place in the haunted psyche of an Imperial stormtrooper on the cusp of defeat. The visuals instantly called to mind a blend of A-ha\u2019s \u201cTake on Me\u201d music video and Heavy Metal, depicting a battle to the death between a green-hued stormtrooper and a red-tinged stormtrooper just before the Death Star explodes around them during the events of Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope. Ohira explained that the short was designed less as a traditional narrative and more like a music video, with its meaning intentionally left open to interpretation.\n\nHe added that the short\u2019s central theme is \u201cshowing sacrifice in the name of justice.\u201d Amid the violence and death, the visuals pause for a tender moment: The \"Green\" stormtrooper lies in the grass, in a tattered helm and uniform, gazing at the sky, surrounded by nature. A woman with long hair stands over him. It underscores what these faceless soldiers give up in pursuit of their service to the Empire. The sequence reflects the duality of humanity and its inherent violence, along with the cycle of life and death. As the battle escalates and the Death Star begins to disintegrate, Green and Red appear to set aside their conflict in a desperate attempt to escape, though their effort is ultimately futile.\n\nThough it avoids a lore-heavy narrative, this episode highlights how Visions celebrates Star Wars in ways Lucas\u2019 animated series Star Wars: The Clone Wars never could. The franchise has borrowed heavily from Japanese culture since its inception. (For example, it's well-known that Lucas drew inspiration from Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress.) Visions gives Japanese artists the chance to explore the themes George Lucas only hinted at, with authentic voices and through an animation genre that thrives on experimentation. Visions\u2019 distinctive art styles and fast-paced action, reminiscent of Genndy Tartakovsky\u2019s earlier Clone Wars series, capture an intensity that live-action can barely touch, and one that the CGI style of Lucas\u2019 Clone Wars often struggled to convey.\n\nStar Wars: Visions Volume 3 will feature new shorts from returning studios Kamikaze Douga, Kinema Citrus, Production I.G, and TRIGGER, along with newcomers ANIMA, David Production, Polygon Pictures, Project Studio Q, and WIT Studio. The series returns to Disney Plus on Oct 29.",

      "text": "We live in a world where Jurassic Park, The Goonies, and Back to the Future are the top theatrical releases of the week \u2014 and drive-in theaters are the most frequented venues to see them. It\u2019s a weird moment!\nBut picking up on the nostalgic moment has us catching up with backlogs of recent hits and certifiable classics. Below, we\u2019ve collected our other favorites from the weekend, in hopes of offering a suggestion or two of what you should watch this week. Be sure to let us know in the comments what you enjoyed over the weekend, too.\nAkira\nAkira is the gold standard of anime feature films, having paved the way for mature storytelling both in Japan and around the world. There\u2019s no Matrix, Metal Gear Solid, Shin Godzilla or post-\u201980s post-apocalyptic fiction without Katsuhiro Otomo\u2019s seminal cyberpunk saga. Thanks to a driven director and skyrocketed budget, the film is meticulous and hyper-detailed. Animated films literally can\u2019t afford to be as intricate as Akira.\nBut after being cannibalized by admirers and exalted by critics for 30 years, does it stand as more than a spectacle? Frankly, this might be the most urgent moment to watch Akira since it\u2019s original release. Exploring oppressive governments, violent police, a rebellious-but-lost generation, and a society driven to create a perfect weapon to defend the last failed weapon, Katsuhiro Otomo says the awful part of our current circumstance out loud. Things can get worse, can get more violent, can end it absolute catastrophe. As young motorcycle gangster Kaneda races through the streets of Neo-Tokyo to save his pal Tetsuo, warped by destructive psychic powers, he beholds every kind of human failure, from slobbering misogyny to systematic fascism. Katsuhiro Otomo renders his story in a city\u2019s glow and nightmarish surrealism. I\u2019ve seen the movie four times, and this go-around my jaw was lower on the floor than ever before, somehow. \u2014Matt Patches\nAkira is available to stream with subs or English dub on Hulu.\nAre You Afraid of the Dark? (2019)\nI didn\u2019t watch much Power Rangers growing up (I thought it was for boys!) so I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the 2017 Power Rangers film. Though the tone doesn\u2019t always feel balanced, I liked that it took time to establish the charismatic teen leads\u2019 personalities and relationships before the mighty morphin\u2019 started.\nAre You Afraid of the Dark? is another \u201990s kids show that I missed (I was a scaredy cat!) but sometimes my husband will throw on an episode of the Nickelodeon horror anthology while we\u2019re eating our Saturday morning cereal and watching TV from our childhoods. This weekend we decided to check out the 2019 reboot, shot by Power Rangers director Dean Israelite, and, holy crap, is it a delight.\nRather than an anthology, the three-episode reboot focuses on one girl\u2019s introduction to The Midnight Society storytelling group that served as the framing device in the original series. But the scary story she tells on her initiation night \u2014 a tale about a creepy carnival that abducts children \u2014 starts coming true, and she\u2019s the only one who can stop it.\nI loved it for many of the same reasons I liked Power Rangers: I\u2019m a sucker for charming kids who are put into extraordinary situations and work together to defeat evil. The miniseries format is a little more forgiving to Israelite\u2019s inclination to focus on personalities and relationships before it gets to the action. Nickelodeon greenlit a season 2 of the reboot, which I will happily consume over a bowl of cereal when it airs. \u2014Emily Heller\nAre You Afraid of the Dark? (2019) is available to purchase on Amazon, Vudu, and other digital services.\nDouglas\nHannah Gadsby\u2019s second comedy special for Netflix, which she describes as a \u201cdifficult second album,\u201d follows the smash success of her revealing and introspective Netflix comedy special debut, Nanette. Nanette was a criticism of comedy itself, as well as Gadsby\u2019s own work; she looked back on past jokes she told about coming out and her struggle with queer identity, then interrogated those jokes in tangents that were often uncomfortably joke-free. The special resonated with many queer people (including yours truly) because of its daring to discomfort its audience, its refusal to fall into the easy and safe mode of deploying a joke to diffuse the tension of Gadsby\u2019s raw retelling of, for example, the time she was on the other end of a hate crime.\nDouglas goes ahead and acknowledges the specter of Nanette\u2019s success and the way it changed Gadsby\u2019s life. The result is a very different show and a much more traditional comedy show, which comes as some surprise given that it\u2019s the follow-up to a show in which Gadsby repeatedly said she was going to quit comedy (and yet also, as she acknowledged in Nanette, she\u2019s hardly suited for anything else, with an art history degree and no job experience outside of comedy). One of the running themes in Douglas involves Gadsby claiming to have no idea that her personal traumas (as shared in Nanette) would be so popular. I don\u2019t buy that bit, though. I think she knows that people eat this sort of thing up, which is probably why Douglas is also about her autism diagnosis, positioned here as yet another hurdle between Gadsby and the \u201cnormals\u201d.\nAfter finishing Douglas, I went back and revisited Nanette, which I hadn\u2019t seen since 2018. It made me cry the second time around, just like the first. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a better special. Douglas shows how Gadsby\u2019s life has changed, as it incorporates several jokes about the difficulty of existing in the public eye and withstanding intense scrutiny from critics after Nanette. While Nanette was about Gadsby\u2019s anger at herself (as well as her quest to move past that in her own work), Douglas is about the anger that others feel towards her \u2014 and Gadsby\u2019s embrace of it. She describes eating up haters\u2019 words like a tasty meal, one that nourishes a psyche that \u2014 we\u2019re led to believe, at least \u2014 can withstand it all with ease.\nI\u2019m not sure whether the real-life Gadsby likes the scrutiny so much. I know I wouldn\u2019t. But by making a special about it, it may be easier for her to move past the scrutiny on Nanette and on herself, and for her next comedy special \u2013 because, at this point, she\u2019ll surely get a third \u2013 will be about something else entirely new. I\u2019m looking forward to it. \u2014Maddy Myers\nDouglas and Nanette are available to stream on Netflix.\nFirst Cow\nI\u2019ve never been that much of a fan of Kelly Reichardt\u2019s films. They\u2019re beautifully shot and designed and acted, but I\u2019ve always found them a little remote and opaque, prone to asking questions Reichardt doesn\u2019t intend to answer. I enjoy some films with unresolved endings, but Reichardt seems to have built a career on seducing viewers into a story and a set of worldviews, then leaving that audience adrift with a message about how the world is messy and we don\u2019t always get resolution, catharsis, or answers.\nFirst Cow was the first film of hers that didn\u2019t leave me a bit cold or frustrated. The story of two gentle souls trying to get by in Oregon in the 1820s, among cruder, more violent types, it\u2019s strangely sweet, but also gripping and even nerve-racking in places. This time, Reichardt guarantees we won\u2019t be frustrated with the ending by starting the story with the ending, guaranteeing that the whole film will be both a tense question of \u201cHow do we arrive here?\u201d and \u201cIs this a bad thing?\u201d The film is, per usual for Reichardt, rich in detail, from the ragged hand-me-down clothing to the mud that gets everywhere and on everyone. But it also finds a warm balance between tension and the pleasure of just watching two kindred types find each other and make a life for themselves in a difficult place. \u2014Tasha Robinson\nFirst Cow is available to rent on Amazon, Vudu, and other digital services.\nMiller\u2019s Crossing\nI participate in a movie club with a few friends where we all agree to watch a movie none of us have seen. This week\u2019s pick was 1990\u2019s Miller\u2019s Crossing, the third movie by the Coen brothers. It\u2019s a super-dense, complex film in terms of plotting, but it\u2019s also amazing to see the Coens\u2019 sense of artistry and humor haven\u2019t changed all that much over the last 30 years. The movie is also stacked with acting talent putting in incredible work, including the lesser-known Jon Polito, a \u201cthat guy\u201d actor (I knew him as the detective from The Big Lebowski \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m a brother seamus!\u201d) who delivers an electrifying unhinged-mob-boss performance. If you\u2019re looking for a movie that rewards intense focus, this one fits the bill. Also there\u2019s a great scene with a chair I won\u2019t spoil. \u2014Russ Frushtick\nMiller\u2019s Crossing is available for rent on Amazon and other digital services.\nPonyo\nI didn\u2019t buy an extravagantly large television to watch a Hayao Miyazaki movie on my laptop screen, so for weeks I\u2019ve been patiently waiting for Roku and Warner Bros. to work out whatever it is they need to work out in order to get an HBO Max Roku app. Then I found out there\u2019s an HBO Max app for the Playstation.\nSo anyway, I watched Ponyo for the first time this weekend, and I have one thing to report: Ponyo love Sasuke. Thank you for reading.\n\u2014Susana Polo\nPonyo is available to stream with subs or dubs on HBO Max.\nSunset Boulevard\nOn a wall in the office of my childhood home, there was a poster of 101 Greatest Movie Quotes, which my sister and I would read aloud in different, dramatic voices. At that point in time, we hadn\u2019t seen many of the movies on that list, so we always got a special thrill when one of the lines popped up in a movie (it turns out we were pronouncing the \u201cLouis\u201d in \u201cLouis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship\u201d wrong for years).\nThe most I knew of Sunset Boulevard were the two quotes on this poster (No. 7: \u201cAll right, Mr. DeMille. I\u2019m ready for my closeup\u201d and no. 24: \u201cI am big! It\u2019s the pictures that got small!\u201d) I had no idea how tragic those lines were in the greater scheme of the movie, particularly the close-up one. The story of fallen silent film star Norma Desmond and her desperate clinging to her glory days is still sticking with me days later.\nAlso, at one point my fianc\u00e9 turned to me and said, \u201cI\u2019m fully expecting you to start talking in a Mid-Atlantic accent and pretending the apartment is a decrepit 1920s Hollywood mansion\u201d and, frankly, I felt seen. \u2014 Petrana Radulovic\nSunset Boulevard is available to stream on Amazon Prime.\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre\nOver the past couple of months, it\u2019s felt like the universe was nudging me to revisit this John Huston classic, in which a trio of vagabonds prospect the Sierra Madre mountains for gold. Everywhere I looked, there it was. I watched Spike Lee\u2019\u2019s excellent pseudo-heist film Da 5 Bloods, which gleefully takes inspiration from the classic. Then the YouTube channel Nerdwriter praised Humphrey Bogart\u2019s performance as the villainous vagabond Dobbs. And when the film appeared on HBO Max, my Twitter timeline filled with GIFs of one of the movie\u2019s most iconic lines. I woke up early Saturday morning and figured, hey, why resist kismet?\nTurns out the universe was doing me a solid. What an incredible film. The script is filled with so many great lines, the plotting is lean and tense, and Bogart\u2019s performance is amazing, reminding me of Toshiro Mifune in Rashomon and Daniel Day-Lewis in There Will Be Blood, the latter of whom almost certainly took inspiration from the film. Now I get why the movie kept popping up: tons of modern movies crib from it as if The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is an ur-text from which countless thrillers and heist movies sprout. \u2014Chris Plante\nThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre is available to stream on HBO Max and to rent on Amazon."

      "text": "The Matrix Resurrections, Lana Wachowski\u2019s return to the universe of the Matrix nearly 18 years since the conclusion of the original trilogy, returned to streaming on HBO Max this week following its premiere last December.\nBack in 2003, the Wachowskis created what remains to this day one of the most ambitious multimedia storytelling projects attempted in mainstream cinema: an interconnected universe of comic books, video games, and anime designed to be released and watched within and after the six-month release window between 2003\u2019s The Matrix Reloaded and 2003\u2019s The Matrix Revolutions.\nWhile certain titles, in particular the 2003 video game Enter the Matrix and the 2005 MMO The Matrix Online, have either become harder to find or discontinued outright \u2014 thus rendering it impossible to experience the original story as it was intended \u2014 the 2003 anime anthology The Animatrix remains both widely available (streaming on HBO Max) and highly acclaimed by both fans of the franchise and animation enthusiasts alike. Produced by the Wachowskis and boasting the inimitable talents of directors such as Mahiro Maeda, Shinichir\u014d Watanabe, Yoshiaki Kawajiri, and more, The Animatrix reigns supreme as the platonic ideal of what one would want out of another franchise anthology tie-in of its ilk.\nIn honor of the arrival of the latest Matrix entry on streaming, let\u2019s take a look back on one of the enduring cornerstones of the Matrix multimedia project and break down how each short ties into the larger mythos of the series and what they contribute to the universe as a whole.\nFinal Flight of the Osiris\nWhat it is: Directed by visual effects animator Andy Jones (Avatar) and produced by Square Pictures, Final Flight of the Osiris depicts the discovery of a massive Machine army by a resistance hovercraft crew and their last-ditch effort to warn the human city of Zion of its imminent attack.\nHow it relates to the original Matrix: Final Flight of the Osiris is a direct prequel to 2003\u2019s The Matrix Reloaded and the 2003 video game Enter the Matrix, offering details pertaining to an important event that transpires between the events of the original Matrix film and its cinematic sequels.\nWhat it adds to the Matrix: More cool, sexy dojo fights; more terrifying mechanical squid monsters; and more spectacular acrobatics and parkour, rendered in the same uncanny valley-adjacent animation style of 2001\u2019s Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.\nThe Second Renaissance (Part I and II)\nWhat it is: Directed by Mahiro Maeda (Blue Submarine No. 6, Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo), The Second Renaissance tells the story of the beginnings of the Human-Machine War, from the end of the golden era of artificial intelligence to the creation of the Matrix.\nHow it relates to the original Matrix: Written by the Wachowskis, and partially based on the 1999 web comic Bits and Pieces of Information, The Second Renaissance is the canonical prequel to the original Matrix trilogy.\nWhat it adds to the Matrix: Quite a lot, in fact! Before this film, the closest audiences had to an explanation of the Matrix\u2019s origins was Morpheus\u2019 \u201cDesert of the Real\u201d speech from The Matrix. Unlike Morpheus\u2019 take, though, The Second Renaissance doesn\u2019t paint humanity at all in a flattering light, conjuring parallels to multiple historical atrocities to depict the cruelty humans inflicted on their Machine creations. The second part goes on to explore the Machines\u2019 thwarted attempts to peacefully coexist with their creators, the creation of the nanite shroud that covered the planet in perpetual darkness, and the last-ditch creation of the Matrix by the Machines out of existential necessity.\nThe framing of the short, that of a Zion archive program guiding the viewer through a historical simulation, implies that certain members of Zion \u2014 contrary to what others might believe \u2014 are in fact aware of the true origins of the Human-Machine War, and have chosen to conceal this truth so as not to undermine the morale of the human resistance.\nKid\u2019s Story\nWhat it is: Directed by Shinichir\u014d Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo), Kid\u2019s Story follows a teenager who discovers the Matrix and enters the Real World through surprising, albeit fatally tragic, means.\nHow it relates to the original Matrix: Written by the Wachowskis, Kid\u2019s Story depicts the origin of Kid, a supporting character in The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions who would go on to perform an important role in the humans\u2019 defense of Zion while under attack by the Machine army. It also features a brief vocal cameo by Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss as Neo and Trinity.\nWhat it adds to the Matrix: Aside from arguably being the grisliest short in the entire Animatrix anthology, Kid\u2019s Story introduces the concept of \u201cself-substantiation\u201d: the ability to exit the Matrix without the use of a red pill through willpower alone. Although not explained in detail, a similar phenomenon is mentioned by Morpheus in The Matrix when discussing the legend of the first founder of Zion, who freed himself without outside assistance.\nProgram\nWhat it is: Directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Ninja Scroll, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust), Program tells the story of Cis and Duo, two human resistance members sparring in a training simulation modeled after ancient Japan. When a terrible revelation comes to light, the two are forced to battle one another to the death.\nHow it relates to the original Matrix: No direct connection with the rest of the Matrix franchise.\nWhat it adds to the Matrix: Ninja Scroll was one of the anime films cited by The Wachowskis as a core inspiration behind the original Matrix film, alongside 1988\u2019s Akira and 1995\u2019s Ghost in the Shell. Here, Kawajiri takes the same kinetic swordplay and feudal Japanese aesthetic of that film and transplants it into the world of the Matrix to stellar effect, delivering a heart-racing duel that gradually escalates with wuxia-like grace and ferocity.\nWorld Record\nWhat is it: Directed by Takeshi Koike (Redline), World Record tells the story of Dan Davis, a disgraced American athlete whose attempt to set the world record for the 100-meter sprint brings him to the brink of becoming aware of the Matrix.\nHow it relates to the original Matrix: No direct connection with the rest of the Matrix franchise.\nWhat it adds to the Matrix: World Record touches on the same concept of \u201cself-substantiation\u201d broached in Shinichir\u014d Watanabe\u2019s Kid\u2019s Story. While that is interesting in and of itself, the real draw for this short is in its visuals. Koike is a superb animator with a distinctive style that evokes comparison to the aesthetic flamboyance of Franco-Belgian comics, the exaggerated character designs of his contemporary Peter Chung, and the stark, silhouette-heavy aesthetic of Frank Miller\u2019s Sin City.\nWorld Record\u2019s strength is in transforming the spectacle of physical exhaustion into high drama, with muscles spasming and thin geysers of blood erupting as Dan comes within hair\u2019s breadth of the finish line. In a lot of ways it feels like an indirect tribute to his former mentor Yoshiaki Kawajiri\u2019s previous short for the 1987 anime anthology Neo Tokyo, ironically enough titled \u201cRunning Man.\u201d In the end, World Record itself amounts to another tragic yet moving story of perseverance in the face of impossible odds, the kind of story that speaks to the heart of the core themes and ideas behind the Matrix series.\nBeyond\nWhat it is: Directed by animator K\u014dji Morimoto (Memories, Akira), Beyond follows the story of a teenage girl whose search for her missing cat leads her to an abandoned building \u201chaunted\u201d by strange, inexplicable phenomena.\nHow it relates to the original Matrix: No direct connection with the rest of the Matrix franchise.\nWhat it adds to the Matrix: The in-universe explanation of supernatural phenomena as \u201cglitches\u201d in the Matrix dates as far back as the original film and was later expanded on in 2003\u2019s The Matrix Reloaded. Morimoto\u2019s short explores this concept, as well as an alternative to the phenomenon of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, from the unwitting perspective of a rambunctious group of adolescents. Beyond repurposes the core elements of The Matrix in service of a story that touches on the imaginative possibilities of childhood and the melancholy of witnessing a place that meant so much to you in your youth being demolished and bulldozed to construct yet another identical parking lot.\nA Detective Story\nWhat is it: Shinichir\u014d Watanabe\u2019s second anthology short follows the story of a private detective whose search for a mysterious hacker will lead him to question the very nature of his reality.\nHow it relates to the original Matrix: Set in a version of the Matrix entirely independent from the one glimpsed in the Matrix trilogy, A Detective Story nonetheless features a prominent cameo by Trinity.\nWhat it adds to the Matrix: While the plot of A Detective Story has no direct ties to the rest of the Matrix franchise, the short arguably stands out as one the most visually distinctive of the anthology, with grainy, monochromatic visuals; analog, steampunk-adjacent technology; and an eerie, noir-inflected score by Matrix trilogy composer Don Davis. It\u2019s those visuals, and in particular the appearance of Trinity, that gesture toward a tantalizing possibility that the Matrix as seen in the original trilogy and the one seen in this short \u2014 or for that matter, any of the Animatrix shorts \u2014 are in fact nothing but a handful of an incalculably vast number of Matrices running simultaneously alongside one another.\nMatriculated\nWhat it is: Directed by Peter Chung (\u00c6on Flux), Matriculated follows a group of above-ground human rebels who attempt to use a \u201cMatrix\u201d of their own design to convert an enemy Machine sentinel to their cause.\nHow it relates to the original Matrix: No direct connection with the rest of the Matrix franchise.\nWhat it adds to the Matrix: The concept of a human-created Matrix is a fascinating one. We\u2019ve seen training simulations, such as the jump test and sparring dojo where Neo fought Morpheus in the original Matrix film, but a Matrix created specifically for Machines in mind to navigate and interact with is unique to Matriculated. Far from the sterile hyperreality of the Matrix we know from the films, the Matrix glimpsed here is a labyrinth of earthly delights composed of pulsing fractal-like textures, writhing organic masses, and hallucinatory dimensions."

      "text": "To say that the cyberpunk genre as a whole owes an immeasurable debt to Blade Runner feels like an understatement. Before either William Gibson\u2019s Neuromancer, Bruce Sterling\u2019s Mirrorshades anthology, or even the novel by Bruce Bethke from which the genre would go on to derive its very name, Ridley Scott\u2019s adaptation of Philip K. Dick\u2019s Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? laid the foundation for the visual language that defines so much of cyberpunk to this day.\nThat visual language would go on to inspire not only a generation of filmmakers, but animators as well, as Blade Runner\u2019s indelible cultural footprint was seen and felt through innumerable references throughout some of the most popular works of Japanese animation. From iconic films like 1995\u2019s Ghost in the Shell and 2001\u2019s Metropolis, to lesser known but no less influential works like Mobile Police Patlabor and the 1987 OVA (original video animation) Bubblegum Crisis, the popularity and maturation of anime as a globally recognized artform and the aesthetic precedent of Ridley Scott\u2019s Blade Runner are inextricably bound to one another. The idea of an anime not only inspired, but explicitly set in the universe of the 1982 sci-fi noir then was never truly a question of \u201cif,\u201d but rather only a matter of \u201cwhen.\u201d\nNearly four decades after Scott\u2019s film first premiered in theaters, and only four years following the release of Denis Villeneuve\u2019s 2017 follow-up, the inevitability of a Blade Runner anime has finally been realized. A 13-episode CG animated series directed by Shinji Aramaki (Appleseed) and Kenji Kamiyama (Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex), Blade Runner: Black Lotus may not be the anime that fans of the series had hoped for or imagined when it was announced back in 2018, but it nonetheless proves itself worthy of the distinction.\nSet in the year 2032 \u2014 13 years after the events of Blade Runner and 17 years before the 2017\u2019s Blade Runner 2049 \u2014 Black Lotus centers on the story of Elle, a young woman who awakens in an abandoned building in the desert with a lotus tattoo on her shoulder and no memory of how she got there. Mercilessly hunted for sport by a group of gunmen, Elle finds herself mysteriously unable to do any harm to people chasing her. Though she does not immediately understand herself, Blade Runner fans will recognize why Elle cannot fight back: she is in fact a \u201creplicant,\u201d a synthetic android created to impersonate and serve humans who, after the events of Blade Runner, were prevented from doing harm to humans even in self-defense. And yet, something unexpectedly is triggered deep inside of Elle\u2019s programming, allowing her the ability and strength to overpower and kill her would-be executioner before fleeing aboard an self-driving delivery truck bound for Los Angeles in search of refuge and answers to her own mysterious nature.\nIn the hands of Aramaki and Kamiya, the first and second episode of Blade Runner: Black Lotus already boast a marked improvement over the directors\u2019 previous series Ghost in the Shell:SAC_2045 in terms of its visuals and action. The atmospheric composition of select scenes, like Elle illuminated in the green fluorescent glow of an automated delivery truck\u2019s headlights or the climatic courtyard fight at the end of second episode wherein Elle brandishes a katana while lit in ethereal neon red, are particularly striking, as are the numerous easter eggs and iconic locations seen throughout Elle\u2019s introduction to the city. Of the returning characters featured in Blade Runner: Black Lotus, the most prominent one seen in the series\u2019 initial two episodes is Doc Badger, the pawn shop owner portrayed by Barkhad Abdi in 2017\u2019s Blade Runner 2049, who aids Elle in her attempt to navigate the strange and unfamiliar world she finds herself in in exchange for protection against a local gang of lowlifes. The structure of the first two episodes, which jumps forward and back between Elle\u2019s awakening in the desert and several days after her arrival in Los Angeles, may be a bit confusing for some audiences, but this temporary confusion is ultimately in service of placing the viewer in the perspective of Elle herself as she sifts through the stimuli of the world around her. But Elle\u2019s journey of personal discovery renders her not all that dissimilar from Officer K in Blade Runner 2049 or even Deckard from the original Blade Runner; protagonists searching for charity and purpose in their own existence, all while parsing the question of what constitutes as \u201creal\u201d in their own lives. The plot of the opening episodes of Blade Runner: Black Lotus takes a bit to ramp up as it establishes Elle\u2019s quest for answers as well the state of the world itself, but eventually settles into an engrossing sci-fi neo-noir revenge story as the series progresses. Aramaki and Kamiyama understand what makes Blade Runner such an enduring and resonant universe, both visually and thematically. And Blade Runner: Black Lotus homes in on those attributes through a replicant\u2019s search for meaning \u2014 and revenge \u2014 rendered through an interpretation of an alternate-future Los Angeles in the midst of becoming the dark, post-anthropocene metropolis glimpsed in Blade Runner 2049.\nAs an anime, Blade Runner: Black Lotus will obviously invoke pointed comparisons not only to Blade Runner and Blade Runner 2049, but to Cowboy Bebop director Shinichir\u014d Watanabe\u2019s anime short Blade Runner Black Out 2022. The short set a nigh impossibly high bar for any other Blade Runner-affiliated anime that would succeed it, amassing an impressive roster of collaborators to work on the film that basically boiled down to a who\u2019s who list of anime luminaries including the likes of Sh\u016bk\u014d Murase (Mobile Suit Gundam: Hathaway), Hiroyuki Okiura (Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade), Shinya Ohira (Ping Pong), and even future Black Lotus director Aramaki. Admittedly, it feels mildly unfair to compare the two, as the level of energy and coordination required to reconvene this same group of highly-talented animators years later to produce a 13-episode anime would alone render such a project itself virtually impossible. Truthfully, it feels like a minor miracle that Blade Runner Black Out 2022 even happened at all.\nTo be frank, Blade Runner: Black Lotus doesn\u2019t look nearly as impressive as Black Out 2022. There\u2019s nothing here that compares to Shinya Ohira\u2019s impressionistic interpretation of the battlefields of Calantha, or the climactic shootout between a pair of replicants against Tyrell security forces animated by Okiura and Bahi JD. And while that undoubtedly will come as a disappointment to some viewers, it nonetheless makes an argument for its own existence as the series progresses on the strength of an aesthetic that combines photo realistic environments with bold stylistic lighting choices and composition, its engrossing action and gorgeous establishing shots, and its appropriately subdued and eerie synth score that feels evocative of Vangelis\u2019 iconic work on the 1982 original. The one exception of this last point being the anime\u2019s use of EDM pop tracks like Alessia Cara\u2019s \u201cFeel You Now\u201d or Daya\u2019s \u201cEvil\u201d which play over the series\u2019 opening and closing titles, and while these music choices themselves might prove irksome to die-hard Blade Runner purists, their relegation to the bookends of the episodes themselves renders them more or less inoffensive attempt to broaden the palette of the franchise as a whole. Its ambitions aside, Blade Runner Black Lotus amounts to a worthy addition to the Blade Runner series that\u2019s as much of an entertaining individual story on its own as it is a prequel further embellishing the groundwork for the world glimpsed in Blade Runner 2049.\nWhile it may be easy to discount the series at glance, both Blade Runner fans and even those new to the franchise might be taken aback by what Blade Runner: Black Lotus has to offer. Much like the humanoid replicants, appearances can be deceiving.\nBlade Runner: Black Lotus will premiere at midnight on Nov. 13 and will air on both Adult Swim and Crunchyroll."

      "text": "We take our animated anthology titles very literally here at Polygon. In the grand tradition of our Love, Death, & Robots analysis pieces that break down Netflix\u2019s animated anthology series by the amount of love, death, and robots each one contains, we\u2019re setting out to break down Disney Plus\u2019 Star Wars anime anthology Star Wars: Visions by considering how many stars, wars, and visions they contain.\nWhat does this mean? Stars and wars are pretty self-explanatory, but when it comes to visions, I\u2019ll be looking for what\u2019s innovative about each of the nine shorts in the original Star Wars: Visions lineup, and considering how each one uses animation to explore the vast galaxy of the Star Wars universe. Seven different studios participated in making Star Wars: Visions\u2019 nine episodes, and each short tells a completely different story, which means the potential for innovation is high.\n\u201cThe Duel\u201d\nA mysterious wandering stranger steps up to defend a village besieged by ragged bandits. In taking them on, he reveals a stunning truth about the nature of his past.\nStars: Not a lot here, surprisingly! It presumably takes place on a distant planet, but it could very well be a remote countryside village on Earth, especially given how much inspiration it draws from samurai movies.\nWars: A Sith Lord invades the tiny village, leading to multiple battles between her minions and the village\u2019s protectors, and between her and the stranger. There are hints that this is part of a greater war \u2014 for instance, the leader of the village is a child, and it\u2019s heavily implied that he inherited the position when his father was taken down in a previous invasion.\nVision: This short is rendered entirely in black and white, save for the bright flashes of gunfire and lightsabers. The particular lightsaber weapons used are also super-cool. Additionally, this short takes an unusual third-party approach to the morality of the Star Wars universe, one we haven\u2019t really seen in the live-action films.\nDoes it work? Considering how black and white the morality of the Star Wars universe often is (the Dark Side is evil; the Light Side is good), the palette here emphasizes the plot twist toward the end, which adds nuance to the familiar dichotomy. The fight is sharp and gorgeous, with the flashes of color highlighting the best parts of the action.\n\u201cTatooine Rhapsody\u201d\nA scrappy band with big dreams must rally to save one of their beloved bandmates from the clutches of Jabba the Hutt and Boba Fett.\nStars: The band flies through space, landing on different planets! This one actually features more space travel than many of the other shorts.\nWars: There is no actual war going on, but the poor band can\u2019t catch a break because their Hutt guitarist has a bounty on his head. Every time they perform, they\u2019re rudely interrupted by eager bounty hunters looking to cash in the top prize from Jabba the Hutt. They\u2019ve never been able to finish a set!\nVisions: This is the only short to incorporate existing Star Wars characters, but even so, it uses them in different ways than expected. The animation takes on a more cartoon-inspired look, which speaks to the more lighthearted tone. Sure, the guitarist has a bounty on his head, but they save the day with the power of music!\nDoes it work? Why isn\u2019t more Star Wars like this? \u201cTatooine Rhapsody\u201d is literally just about a band that wants to jam together, but can\u2019t because they\u2019re caught up in Jabba the Hutt\u2019s whims. The narrative centers on found family and rock music, along with hints of tragic pasts that don\u2019t drag down the story. It\u2019s just a fun time, and a different side of the Star Wars universe than the movies or previous TV series show. A lot of these shorts focus on the Jedi-Sith of it all, but not \u201cTatooine Rhapsody.\u201d\n\u201cThe Twins\u201d\nA secret set of twins born into the Dark Side clash on board a massive Star Destroyer when one steals a powerful weapon. During their epic battle, they will make choices that will forever alter their destinies.\nStars: The bulk of the short is an epic duel on the top of a spaceship. There are sweeping shots of stars and space around the two main characters (the titular twins) as they battle it out.\nWars: Aside from the battle that takes up most of this short, the twins were specifically created to bring order to the galaxy \u2014 by harnessing their Force powers into a giant death laser, presumably designed to threaten planets into compliance, lest they meet the fate of Alderaan. Not a war yet, but clearly one was intended.\nVisions: For those familiar with Studio Trigger\u2019s Promare, a lot of this short\u2019s animation will seem very familiar. Still, to the Star Wars world, the bright blocks of color used to represent Force powers \u2014 as well as the protagonists\u2019 billowing hair \u2014 are new and dramatically eye-catching. Having a battle on the outside of a spaceship (how does that work?!) is also just bonkers fun.\nDoes it work? If you like dramatic fights with cool powers and implausible physics (once again \u2014 hair billowing in space?), then this is the short for you. Force-connected twins is a common Star Wars trope, but seeing it done on the Dark Side makes for a refreshing turn of events.\n\u201cThe Village Bride\u201d\nA Jedi on the run is summoned by an old ally to observe the strange and beautiful customs of a remote village on the eve of a wedding. The Jedi must make a choice when she discovers their peace is threatened by a local warlord.\nStars: Aside from the end shot, where someone flies off into space, this is another short that could also just be happening in Earth\u2019s countryside somewhere.\nWars: The characters discuss a war that happened in the past, leaving the small village to still feel the ramifications. There\u2019s a confrontation at the end, but no direct invasion. Still, the scars of war continue to affect the village. One of the Jedi also has some flashbacks to this war.\nVision: It is definitely unusual to see how more of the common folk have been affected by the Empire, and how the Jedi protect them. The way the villagers connect with their planet is also a different way of seeing the Force \u2014 the way people unfamiliar with Jedi knights and the Light and Dark Sides might view a power that connects us all.\nDoes it work? This short feels reminiscent of Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s Castle in the Sky or Princess Mononoke \u2014 the people in the village are intimately tied to the nature of the planet, and able to access its memories through rituals. Unfortunately, that concept is only really used to color the beginning, and by the end, this short becomes a standard battle against a bad guy. Still, the story of the village chief\u2019s granddaughter choosing to give herself up to the warlord in exchange for the village\u2019s safety is compelling.\n\u201cThe Ninth Jedi\u201d\nThe daughter of a legendary lightsaber-smith is pursued by dark forces as she travels across harsh terrain with a very important delivery \u2013 newly crafted lightsabers meant for a rag-tag group of warriors claiming to be Jedi.\nStars: The opening sequence starts off with some shots of the galaxy \u2014 which, yes, includes stars \u2014 though most of the action takes place on a rocky planet.\nWars: A war has been going on in the background, with the Jedi being persecuted. Kara, the daughter of a lightsaber maker, narrowly escapes invaders who capture her father. She must fight her way to a temple to deliver the lightsabers he\u2019s made. Meanwhile, at the temple, the group of Jedi deliberate about whether the master who has summoned them is to be trusted. There\u2019s a war somewhere, but we mostly just see its far-reaching ramifications. Also, there are some pretty epic final battles here.\nVisions: The most innovative plot element of this short is how it plays with lightsaber colors. When Kara first wields a lightsaber, her connection to the Force is not strong enough to render a specific color, and her father tells her that lightsabers\u2019 appearances are decided by the personality of their wielders. But in the climactic battle, she is able to come into that power. The big plot twist is also made all the more dramatic by this particular lightsaber dynamic.\nDoes it work? The short is somewhat predictable, but it is cool \u2014 it\u2019s pretty much a given that not everyone is who they say they are, and that Kara will rise up and be able to use a lightsaber. But damn it if it isn\u2019t thrilling to watch the moment her saber\u2019s color solidifies. It may also make you want to journey to Disney\u2019s Galaxy\u2019s Edge to build a saber of your own.\n\u201cT0-B1\u201d\nA cybernetic boy who dreams to one day become a heroic Jedi discovers a secret about his creator\u2019s past that threatens their once-peaceful existence.\nStars: This short takes place on a distant desert world, where a scientist and the robot boy he created work to restore life to the planet. T0-B1, the little robot hero, looks to the stars, full of dreams of becoming a Jedi and saving the galaxy. Does he get to fly off at the end and achieve them? That\u2019s a spoiler. But aside from that, there is a quick pan to space as someone outside the planet looks on.\nWars: T0-B1 knows very little about the galaxy beyond his little planet, and the scientist who created him refuses to tell him more. But when he does learn about the universe beyond his home, he discovers a war that has forced Jedi into hiding, though the details are pretty scarce. There is a final fight, one that feels like a reflection of a larger war going on.\nVisions: The animation in T0-B1 is soft, inspired by Astro Boy and the work of Osamu Tezuka, akin to a children\u2019s show with curved edges and round shapes. It is nice to see something from a robot\u2019s point of view, considering how full of robots the Star Wars world is.\nDoes it work? Just because the short visually resembles children\u2019s books does not mean the story is trivial; it\u2019s actually bittersweet, as T0-B1 resolves to follow his creator\u2019s goals, and finds a new way to be a Jedi by rehabilitating planets. It\u2019s kinda like Pinocchio, but instead of wanting to be a real boy, T0-B1 wants to be a Jedi.\n\u201cThe Elder\u201d\nA pacifist Jedi and his restless Padawan pursue a dark presence to a small village on an outer rim planet. The Jedi and the Padawan uncover a terrifying truth and must face down an old man who is far more powerful than either imagined.\nStars: Our two heroes fly through space at the beginning, on the way to a remote planet in the Outer Rim. Arguably the most stars out of all these shorts, since there\u2019s so much space travel involved. They even talk about the Jedi\u2019s extensive Outer Rim experience, which leaves his Padawan both a little jealous and a little mocking.\nWars: A mysterious disturbance in the force alerts the Jedi Master to a distant planet\u2026 but while there are individual battles, there does not seem to be any military-motivated conflict. It\u2019s just some guys getting into some fights.\nVisions: \u201cThe Elder\u201d is the most straightforward Star Wars short of all these Star Wars shorts, with interactions straight out of the familiar playbook. Even the archetypes are familiar: a more reserved and peaceful Master dispensing wise adages, juxtaposed with an eager-to-see-action Padawan. The coolest thing are the short sabres wielded by the villain, which aren\u2019t usually seen in the film series.\nDoes it work? The familiarity doesn\u2019t make it less enjoyable, but it does mean it goes pretty much exactly where you think it\u2019ll go. (The final showdown is pretty epic, though.)\n\u201cLop & Och\u014d\u201d\nA powerful patriarch clashes with his eldest daughter about confronting the encroaching Empire. The little adopted sister who is caught in the middle must choose sides.\nStars: Most of the action takes place on one planet, which is slightly more urban than the previous \u201cjust taking place on one planet\u201d shorts. Still, the whole source of conflict comes from the fact that this particular planet has been slow to industrialize \u2014 the chief of the ruling clan wants to resist the Empire\u2019s influence, whereas his oldest daughter believes that the only way her planet stands a chance is if her family allies with the Empire.\nWars: The Empire is invading, slowly but surely. The family at the center is pulled apart by their conflicting views on how to approach the Empire\u2019s growing influence.\nVisions: The character designs \u2014 especially Lop, a bunny-like alien \u2014 are particularly memorable in this one. Och\u014d dramatically cuts off her hair and smears her blood over her eyelids as eyeshadow, which is a cool character moment. The way the lightsaber is incorporated is unexpected and far outside normal Star Wars canon. Also, it\u2019s just generally engaging to see the reasons why a small planet might want to side with the Empire.\nDoes it work? This short broke my heart, more than the entire Star Wars saga put together. (Except maybe for Rogue One.) It\u2019s almost like an inverse of the core Star Wars story: instead of a father finally turning toward the Light Side and reaching to take his son\u2019s hand in his dying moments, it\u2019s about a family torn apart by the Empire and a daughter turning away from her family to join the Dark Side.\n\u201cAkakiri\u201d\nA Jedi returns to his old forbidden love to help defend her kingdom from a Sith-like Shogun. Plagued by haunting visions, the Jedi learns his destiny might not be what he thought it was.\nStars: This is yet another short that could just take place in some historical Earthbound land. Even more than the others, it leans into the feudal Japan inspiration, as the travelers wander through the countryside before making their way to a more populated village.\nWars: Prior to the start, a king was murdered by his secret Sith sister. No specific war is mentioned, but it\u2019s implied that a similar overarching war that has been mentioned in a lot of the other shorts is going on. That Empire gonna Empire!\nVisions: A lot of these shorts draw from feudal Japan, but the description for this one does specifically compare the Sith to a shogun. Because of that, the architecture and design of the setting is dynamic, especially in contrast to the science fiction elements of Star Wars.\nDoes it work? I do wish there was a more clear love story here, like the little blurb promises, but even so, \u201cAkakiri\u201d weaves an evocative story about fate and how the bonds between people lead them down unexpected paths.\nAll nine episodes of Star Wars: Visions are available on Disney Plus."

      "text": "To celebrate the 50th anniversary of 1977\u2019s Star Wars (or A New Hope, as it was retitled four years after its premiere) Lucasfilm will re-release George Lucas\u2019 space opera that started all in theaters in April 2027. But in its announcement on Aug. 1, Lucasfilm played coy: Which version of Star Wars would actually be hitting theaters? Disney isn't ready to say, but did actually return our emails with a comment.\nOver the years, Lucas has become infamous for going back and tinkering with the edits and special effects throughout the original Star Wars trilogy. For the 20th anniversary, Lucasfilm primed the pump for the release of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace with a monthly theatrical re-release of the Star Wars \u201cSpecial Edition\u201d trilogy, which saw robust changes and even additional scenes rendered with then-state-of-the-art computer graphics. In Lucas\u2019 mind, Star Wars 1977 needed a Jabba the Hutt scene, even if longtime fans thought his movie was fine just the way it is. The filmmaker continued to futz with Star Wars for the next three decades, which is how we wound up with the \u201cMaclunkey Cut\u201d on Disney Plus.\nSo \"Star Wars: A New Hope Returns to Theaters for 50th Anniversary,\" as Lucasfilm put it on the official StarWars.com blog, could mean a lot of things \u2014 including a stripped-down, back-to-basics version that recently reentered circulation after collecting dust in the archives.\nIn June, Kathleen Kennedy teamed with the British Film Institute to screen a film print that, to her understanding, was the earliest cut of Star Wars that existed, untouched by its creator\u2019s impulses to tinker and update. The BFI even went an extra step in preparing the film reels for projection, finding an old, complete version of the original crawl, before A New Hope was added to the title, to run in front of the film. Introducing the film, even Kennedy was at a loss for how momentous the occasion felt as a fan of the series.\n\"Even when I came into the company, there was endless conversation about where everything was and what was in fact the \u2018first print,\u2019\" she said before the screening. \"And it's quite remarkable. What you're going to see is in fact the first print, and I'm not even sure there's another one quite like it. It's that rare.\"\nAfter the BFI screening, there was obvious wonder if Lucasfilm would strike prints of this cut of the film and reissue a sanctioned \u201cDespecialized\u201d edition for release. Nearly a month and a half later, the company announced re-release plans in 2027. Makes you think.\nPolygon reached out to Lucasfilm and Disney for clarification on the announcement. Lucasfilm did not return requests for comment. A representative for Disney said the companies were \u201cnot confirming the format of the film at this time.\u201d\nNow that\u2019s a new hope."

      "text": "Before there was 2008\u2019s Star Wars: The Clone Wars, there was \u2026 well, 2003\u2019s Star Wars: The Clone Wars. Produced and directed by veteran animator Genndy Tartakovsky (Dexter\u2019s Laboratory, Samurai Jack), the Daytime Emmy Award-winning animated \u201cmicro-series\u201d of shorts holds a special place in the hearts of many Star Wars fans who watched it when it first aired on Cartoon Network, and for good reason. And after years of being impossible to watch in a legal manner, the collection has appeared on Disney Plus under a \u201cStar Wars Vintage\u201d banner.\nFrom Obi-Wan Kenobi\u2019s fierce battle with the immortal Gen\u2019Dai bounty hunter Dirge (complete with an Akira bike slide reference) to Anakin Skywalker\u2019s tense lightsaber duel against the Sith wannabe-apprentice Asajj Ventress on the jungle moon of Yavin 4 and Mace Windu single-handedly defeating an entire droid army like an invincible Jedi warrior, Tartakovsky\u2019s take boasted some of the most impressive and memorable moments to ever be put to the screen in the saga\u2019s history. But one episode in particular stands out for its introduction of one of the most terrifying villains seen in Star Wars before his live-action theatrical debut: the Confederate droid commander General Grievous.\nIn \u201cChapter 20\u201d of the Clone Wars series, which comprises the last four minutes of the first of two hour-or-so-long compilations released on Disney Plus, we see a group of five Jedi knights cornered inside a wrecked starship by an army of droids. Just as the forces encircle the wreckage, a clawed hand is seen held up, halting the droids to a standstill. The short has all the energy of a hopeless last stand, with the Jedi stating that the droid\u2019s unexpected victory is owed to the strategy of their confederacy\u2019s mysterious new general. Grievous is heard before he\u2019s ever fully seen, announcing to the Jedi that there is no hope of rescue, and that he will grant them a warrior\u2019s death. After a few moments of tension, the ambidextrous four-armed Jedi hunting assassin cyborg makes his appearance; a towering skeletal figure in a white flowing cape, brandishing a pair of lightsabers presumably stolen from a pair of Jedi he had previously murdered and collected as trophies. The short ends with the frightening pace of a horror-movie climax, as Grievous proceeds to mercilessly kill and incapacitate the Jedi until only one is left.\nDesigned by concept artist Warren Fu, General Grievous was developed by George Lucas as a new antagonist for the final installment in the theatrical Star Wars prequel series. Lucas\u2019 initial requests to the artists at Lucasfilm were simply for the new villain to simply be \u201ca droid commander,\u201d while later specifying that he wanted the character to be seen as the deadliest hand to hand fighter the galaxy \u2014 someone, or something, that could strike fear even in the heart of the Jedi. Grievous\u2019 debut in Tartakovsky\u2019s Clone Wars certainly leaves that impression, a predator hanging from darkened ceilings and skulking like a Xenomorph from Alien, stalking prey silently before pouncing in for the kill. More impressive than even Grievous\u2019 design is his fighting style that, according to the DVD audio commentary for the second volume of the series, was inspired by the Brazilian martial art of Capoeira.\nGrievous would go on to serve as a formidable and recurring unstoppable threat for the rest of the series until the final moments of \u201cChapter 25\u201d when, while abducting Chancellor Palpatine in the wake of defeating the trio of Jedi charged with protecting him, Grievous\u2019 chest was force crushed by Mace Windu as the general made his escape. The droid commander would make his next on-screen appearance in 2005\u2019s Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith; a wheezing, hunched over shadow of his former intimidating self. Grievous would nonetheless hold his own in his battle with Obi-Wan Kenobi on the planet of Utapau, though his final moments pale in comparison to the unrelenting force of death and destruction seen in Tarkovsky\u2019s series."

      "text": "With Studio Ghibli\u2019s library now on digital and streaming services, we\u2019ve surveyed the studio\u2019s history, impact, and biggest themes. Read all of the stories on our Ghibli Guide page.\nEarly in our planning process for our Studio Ghibli Guide, we asked the Polygon staff to pick their favorite Ghibli movie \u2014 \u201cNo caviling, no wishy-washy ties; you only get one.\u201d And a clear favorite emerged. Around half of the staffers surveyed identified Hayao Miyazaki\u2019s Spirited Away as the best Ghibli feature, the one that most impressed and spoke to them. That\u2019s a common opinion: Ghibli\u2019s films have been repeatedly nominated for Best Animated Feature Oscars, but Spirited Away is the only winner. And apart from My Neighbor Totoro, which gives Ghibli much of its marketing iconography, it\u2019s the Ghibli title Americans most seem to recognize.\nBut why is it such a dominant favorite? Three of our biggest Spirited Away fans hash it out.\nIs it the story?\nTasha Robinson, film/TV editor: For me, at least, Spirited Away is one of the most instantly accessible Ghibli movies. Not that the studio\u2019s other films are baroque or opaque, but Spirited Away\u2019s opening, with a timid, sulky child thrown into a terrifyingly alien situation, is particularly intense and engaging. We know from the start that Chihiro is unhappy with her life, and easily intimidated by new things. And then suddenly she\u2019s deeply immersed in an environment where everything\u2019s new, and inexplicable, and seemingly dangerous. It\u2019s an irresistible story hook.\nSusana Polo, comics editor: It\u2019s ironic that Spirited Away has many more obvious hallmarks of Western fantasy stories than the Ghibli films that directly adapt them, like Howl\u2019s Moving Castle, or When Marnie Was There. Magical contracts that bind the soul, the immense power of knowing something\u2019s true name or depriving something of it, time flowing differently in the realm beyond. If only Chihiro\u2019s parents had read enough fairy tales, they\u2019d know that you never eat the food in the fairy realm!\nKaren Han, entertainment reporter: These story tropes aren\u2019t exclusive to Western media, though. They crop up in a lot of Eastern media, too. A lot of Japanese folk tales are about not messing with things that aren\u2019t meant for you.\nSusana: Fair point!\nKaren: I also agree with Tasha in that I think it\u2019s the most accessible, and it feels more open because there\u2019s so much to take in. There are so many different kinds of creatures in the bathhouse where Chihiro ends up working. And viewers, like Chihiro, simultaneously have to learn the rules of the place and the rules of the spirit world in general. It\u2019s all fascinating, and it doesn\u2019t hurt that there\u2019s a love story mixed in with it all, too.\nTasha: That\u2019s a particularly good point \u2014 Ghibli movies are almost always centered around big emotions like loneliness or desperation, but since so many of them center on very young protagonists, they don\u2019t always have a romantic angle. And this one is a particularly fandom-friendly angle: two young people from different worlds, but with a secret emotional connection that makes the heroine willing to repeatedly risk everything. These are the kinds of big, fraught tropes that got a subset of fans so invested in Reylo shipping, or Twilight.\nOkay, I just squicked myself out a little, but it\u2019s true that there\u2019s no love so compelling as forbidden love. And here, you have a secret love built on mutual need and respect and courage, full of dangerous and frightening confrontations, and culminating in the most joyous reunion in the Ghibli canon. It\u2019s irresistible.\nIs it the characters?\nKaren: I think no one thing in Spirited Away can be taken separately from the other parts of the movie, but the characters are definitely a huge part of why it\u2019s so affecting. Like a lot of other Ghibli films, this film doesn\u2019t have an outright villain. Even characters who seem like antagonists, like Yubaba or No-Face, become less scary and more sympathetic once you discover what\u2019s going on with them.\nThere\u2019s also the fact that Chihiro is a young girl who is just as bratty as everyone else at that age. She grows as a person to save her family and friends, but she starts out just like anybody else. Being a Ghibli hero doesn\u2019t require superheroic deeds, which feels like a message that\u2019s rarely seen, or done well, in a lot of media.\nTasha: Spirited Away also crowds the screen with significant characters in an unusual way. Heroes often have sidekicks or allies because so many stories underline the value of friendship and the rewards of caring about other people, but they\u2019re often up against a single representative villain in order to simplify the inevitable final faceoff. Spirited Away is packed with memorable characters \u2014 heroes and villains and creatures that don\u2019t clearly fall on any side. Who besides the biggest players really stands out for you? I\u2019ve always been very fond of Kamaj\u012b, the infinite-armed boiler-room chief. I\u2019m a sucker for soft-hearted characters who act tough and brusque when anyone\u2019s watching, and turn to mush only when they\u2019re safely alone.\nSusana: Truly, whom amongst us does not want to be buds with the Radish Spirit?\nTasha: And the hopping lantern that makes squeaky-toy noises when it travels.\nSusana: The Pixar lamp\u2019s ancestor.\nKaren: Kamaj\u012b is definitely a favorite, especially since he\u2019s in charge of all those incredibly cute, sugar-loving soot sprites. I also adore the transformed forms of Boh and the Kashira \u2014 watching them learn to support each other as a purple mouse and a tiny bird is so sweet that it\u2019s almost a pity when they return to their original selves.\nTasha: And shout-out to No-Face, who represents the approval-craving, lonely side of all of us. I love how eerie he is, but more so, how well he channels that eternal feeling of just wanting a certain person\u2019s attention, and not being able to get it because they\u2019ve got their own problems going on.\nAnd then there\u2019s Yubaba the witch, who winds up feeling mostly harmless, but starts out as one of the scariest things in the Ghibli canon \u2014 a roaring mouth the size of Totoro\u2019s, giant creepy glassy eyes, disproportional and bulging and inhuman and predatory, but with a nominally human face. She\u2019s something out of a literal nightmare, the kind of dream where you see an ordinary person and realize she\u2019s also terrifying in deep-seated ways. At the same time, though, she\u2019s a businesswoman who has to keep up on her paperwork. I love her layers.\nIs it the animation?\nKaren: As with all of Miyazaki\u2019s films, the animation is incredibly expressive, and movies like Spirited Away are pretty definitive arguments as to why the art of hand-drawn animation ought to persist. There\u2019s also something really joyous about the character designs, as Miyazaki takes concepts that would be familiar to Japanese audiences \u2014 yokai, bathhouses, calligraphy \u2014 and gives them an eerie freshness by exaggerating their features.\nTasha: It\u2019s also just so detail-rich. As I\u2019ve been going back and watching older Ghibli movies, it\u2019s surprising to me how simple the character design gets in films like My Neighbor Totoro and Castle in the Sky, while still maintaining the familiar house style. Compare those films to Yubaba here, with her lace cuffs and elaborate rings and overly detailed eyebrows! The animation here is so sharp and compelling.\nKaren: I end up thinking about the River Spirit a lot, too, when it comes to the animation. The moments where Spirited Away mixes in a little computer animation are so striking, in this case as a way to make it clear that something really significant is happening as the water bubbles. The River Spirit\u2019s dragon form is animated traditionally, but still seems special because it originated in something strange. I also love that, though it\u2019s mostly been cleared of gunk, there are still some fiddly bits visible in the River Spirit\u2019s body.\nTasha: Haku\u2019s thrashing dragon form is also so impressive. The sequences involving him fleeing a swarm of shikigami, or trying to cough up Zeniba\u2019s seal, are so evocative and scary, because he moves so quickly, and with such lethal purpose. It\u2019s a wonderful visual design, and the way he \u201cswims\u201d through air is particularly striking.\nBut like so many later Ghibli films, a lot of the wonder of the animation here is just in the use of color \u2014 the rich, complicated darks of Yubaba\u2019s lair, the bright simple sky, the washes of blue in the train sequence at the end. It\u2019s a beautiful-looking film that makes a lot out of the difference between jewel-toned claustrophobic spaces and pastel wide-open ones.\nIs it the emotion?\nSusana: When I think of Spirited Away, the first scene that leaps to my mind isn\u2019t any character or plot moment, it\u2019s the \u201ctrain montage.\u201d It\u2019s a sharp tangent from the rest of the film, swerving from a world of bustling fantasy to a vast flooded plain populated by shadowy, but relatively modern, travelers. It\u2019s almost like a tiny experimental film inside the rest of the movie, but still at peace with the whole.\nI could joke around in the language of the Extremely Online and say that the whole scene gives me a Big Emotion, but it wouldn\u2019t be a joke. No matter how many times I see the film, this scene still strikes me with strong, almost undefinable feelings. Familiarity? Loss? Longing? Whatever it is, it\u2019s masterful.\nTasha: I agree with you about the train sequence, but my key scene for emotion in this movie is when Chihiro and Haku are falling through the sky together, and she\u2019s weeping with joy \u2014 those huge fat welling Ghibli puddle-tears that feel so much more primal than ordinary decorous weeping. There\u2019s so much feeling wrapped up in that scene: gladness, relief, catharsis, excitement, and love, all expressed in those giant tears. It\u2019s like Chihiro is experiencing so much, all at once, that she doesn\u2019t even notice she\u2019s falling.\nKaren: I think this is the point where it\u2019s impossible not to bring up Joe Hisaishi\u2019s amazing score. All of his music is pretty romantic, but the score for Spirited Away in particular is so lush and sweeping that it\u2019s impossible not to get caught up in it. I\u2019m especially fond of the theme that plays over the scene Tasha describes, as Chihiro and Haku fall through the sky. The emotions of the scene, heightened by the music, make it impossible not to cry, too.\nIs it something else entirely?\nTasha: I find a lot of appeal in the extreme weirdness of Spirited Away. From the start, the magic that turns Chihiro\u2019s parents into pigs isn\u2019t just threatening, it\u2019s grotesque and ugly and weird. So is the giant-headed witch Yubaba. Why does she have a hopping stack of pet green heads? What the hell is up with that?\nThe fairy-tale elements of this story are familiar \u2014 it\u2019s a classic tale of a mortal child being stolen away into the fairy realm, which has its own magical logic. All the usual fairy-tale rules about the rewards of courtesy and altruism still apply: Everything turns around for Chihiro when she instinctively helps the black-soot creature with its heavy load, and her hard work in helping the river god pays off too. But the execution is still odd and unexpected. Being kind and considerate to No-Face turns it into a ravening monster that devours people, for instance, and the animation that makes it a fat, blobby, many-limbed spider is just so enjoyably hideous. No matter how familiar the structure is here, it\u2019s still a surreal movie, and I love that combination.\nSusana: Ah, but kindness isn\u2019t what transforms No-Face into a monster! It\u2019s all the people who feed his gluttony in order to get his gold. He\u2019s undone when Chihiro modestly refuses his bargain, and he\u2019s forced to learn a healthier way to get people to like him.\nA large part of the brilliance of Spirited Away is how it seamlessly blends the universal fairy-story themes we keep mentioning \u2014 kindness begetting kindness, and rule-bound reciprocity \u2014 with that genre\u2019s evolutionary offspring: the coming-of-age story. Chihiro begins the story bratty and resisting the adventure of moving to a new city. She grows with each act of hard work and selflessness. There\u2019s literally a giant spoiled baby she has to contend with and tame.\nKaren: And I think it\u2019s impossible to discount sentimental value here \u2014 what people bring to the movie, rather than objectively what makes the movie great. My Neighbor Totoro is the first Ghibli movie I saw, but Spirited Away sticks with me because I discovered when I was around Chihiro\u2019s age, and primed for a story about a girl who was like me. Everything we\u2019ve discussed so far mixes into it \u2014 I loved the story, the characters, the animation, the emotion, the music \u2014 and made it especially potent for me, to the point that whenever I watch it, I\u2019m taken back to that moment in time. I literally can\u2019t listen to \u201cOne Summer Day\u201d without crying. It was a perfect movie that hit me at a perfect time.\nVox Media has affiliate partnerships.

      "text": "What with the surprisingly decent The Force Awakens finally out, it seems about time to revisit the large impact Japanese culture had on the birth of the Star Wars mythos.\nMuch of what made Star Wars so fresh and interesting when it emerged in 1977 was how much of it was new, with a lot of that inspired from Japanese culture.\nIt\u2019s widely known that George Lucas was a fan of Akira Kurosawa\u2019s work and famously used inspiration from films like The Hidden Fortress for many of the film\u2019s plot and characters, as well as whole scenes.\nHowever, the influences go far deeper than that. For instance, the term \u201cjidaigeki\u201d is Japanese for \u201cperiod drama\u201d. Films like The Hidden Fortress and other aspects of Kurosawa\u2019s oeuvre were often period pieces. Featuring the trials and tribulations of samurai and peasants caught in-between petulant warlords.\nThe word itself also gave birth to the Jedi and it\u2019s no surprise that they too borrowed many elements from the samurai as well. From their clothes, to the fact they wielded swords and broadly acted in a similar peacekeeping manner across the galaxy. Not to mention that the spiritualistic elements of the Force have heavy leanings towards the teachings within the Bushido. Even the Sith seem to have been based on the ronin, samurai without masters that had a more self-serving attitude.\nDarth Vader\u2019s suit was also very strongly reminiscent of the armor used by Japanese warlords as well. Something that has been referenced many times in the years since (shown above) and with more recent toys too, depicting these characters in a feudal Japanese setting.\nHowever, the space opera element is something that has its roots in much of anime and manga. Specifically the work of Leiji Matsumoto on series like Galaxy Express 999 and Space Battleship Yamato.\nIn the case of the latter, the robot Analyzer (shown below) bears a very strong resemblance to the final design of R2-D2. Now we know that the idea for R2-D2 came from Silent Running and that some of the same team went on to work on Star Wars but the general design is definitely very similar to what appeared in Yamato prior to Star Wars.\nAfter all, the robots in Silent Running look nothing like their counterparts in Star Wars though much of the same techniques were used to bring both to life. So the design of R2-D2 may have had more of a Japanese leaning than many may realize and it seems Japanese fans have noticed the similarity too.\nYou then have things like the machine planet in Galaxy Express 999 bearing a strong resemblance to the Death Star. Though again, this could also be attributed to the semi-mechanical planet Mongo with its own death ray from the Flash Gordon serials.\nNow it\u2019s not clear whether these were direct influences but the timing of many of these are uncanny. Not to mention that much of the broad space opera themes were something that were hugely prevalent in Japanese anime and manga during the 70s.\nNaturally, the original Star Wars had a massive impact on anime and manga at that time too. It\u2019s clear the likes of Mobile Suit Gundam among many others owe a creative debt to the series and Star Wars still has a suitably massive fanbase here as well.\nYet something as vibrant as Star Wars never exists in a vacuum. Lucas has been more than forthright on his love for all things Kurosawa and Japanese period drama but there could be more going on here than just that.\nMaybe Lucas was and still is a fan of anime and that is something that warms my heart, even if it is only a slight possibility.\nThanks to Dr. Darren J.
