      "feedback": "Strong multi-year framing and the intuitive linkage from extended‑enterprise risk to market pricing are solid, but to reach world‑class, the piece needs (1) an explicit regime framework with transition triggers and market consequences, (2) a tighter first‑principles causal map that translates attackers’ and defenders’ incentives into observable risk premia, (3) a sharper, data‑driven base case and risk/scenario deck anchored in the cited numbers, and (4) a concise, decision‑oriented watchlist and inference path that could be monetized in credit, equity, and risk pricing. Edit lines: define Regimes (Regime I: high interconnectedness with nascent AI security; Regime II: rapid AI‑driven defense adoption and tighter governance; Regime III: regulatory/insurance standardization and mature vendor risk management), plus clear transition triggers (material third‑party breach, regulator mandate, spike in vendor‑related losses, or a sustained rise in cyber‑insurance pricing). Attach a formal transmission chain: surface area S ∝ number of active vendor connections; breach probability p ∝ function of social‑engineering vectors and IAM posture; expected loss E ≈ p × L (loss includes reputational/penalty costs beyond direct data loss); security effectiveness e reduces p roughly with diminishing returns; ROI of AI/automation ≈ ΔE − ΔC, with empirical anchors (5.9% of revenue saved, up to 7.7% ROI in high‑impact tasks, 6.9 years to embedded adoption) to calibrate base case and tail outcomes. Reframe base case around a finite, multi‑year path: (i) under Regime II, AI‑driven proactive security compresses breach losses and raises resilience, (ii) under Regime III, standardization dampens dispersion of outcomes but raises cycle costs; provide explicit numeric bands by sector if possible. Expand “what to watch” into a dashboard: track (a) share of COOs with AI‑powered cyber management, (b) incidence/fallout of vendor breaches, (c) automation adoption curves in B2B cyber audits and fraud detection, (d) cyber‑insurance pricing signals, and (e) ongoing ROI realization versus cost base. Strengthen coherence by naming the market channels from the anchors to pricing: credit spreads for highly exposed firms widen with vendor risk; equity risk premia reflect cyber hygiene expectations; insurance premia adjust with observed breach frequency and governance metrics; and profit margins shrink or expand with the cost of resilience. Ensure all statements remain tied to the single allowed source ID (C65X5MY62) and, if possible, integrate precise figures (87% mid‑market concern; 55% COOs with AI‑powered security; 17%→55% adoption; 5.9% revenue saved; 7.7% ROI; 6.9 years to embed) in a single, parsimonious tableless section, while preserving the compact paragraph form. This will deliver a world‑class, regime‑based, first‑principles framework with concrete catalysts, invalidation points, and a clear market‑pricing transmission path.",
