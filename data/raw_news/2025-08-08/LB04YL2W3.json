      "text": "Wealthy New Yorkers say Amex Black Cards have lost their cachet\nHave credit cards lost their prestige?\nA few years ago, whipping out an Amex Black Card was the ultimate status symbol \u2014 so much so that the hip-hop collective A$AP Mob even wrote an entire song about it. But that was 2017.\nNow? It\u2019s all about practicality, not ego. A wealthy subset tell me they are increasingly choosing cards that either offer a suite of banking features, like the Chase Sapphire Reserve, or act as your dream assistant that can get you into Le Veau d\u2019Or and plan your entire trip to San Sebastian, like Atlas.\nWhile companies like American Express and Capital One don\u2019t break out the numbers for the cards targeted at high-net-worth clients, it is clearly still an alluring space for companies.\nPopular trading app Robinhood unveiled a limited-edition 10-karat gold card last year. Amex Platinum, Citi Strata Elite, and Capital One Venture X have also invested in metal cards that have more weight and gravitas than the plastic \u201cstarter credit card\u201d you get in college.\nBut the cool factor just isn\u2019t there anymore. People tell me high-end credit cards aren\u2019t a signal of wealth the way they used to be. (That\u2019s what Instagram is for.)\nPart of it has to do with the fact that people aren\u2019t pulling cards out of their wallets as much due to the rise of alternative payment methods like Apple Pay. A growing number of restaurants are even sending customers a link where they can pay the tab online, and of course everyone is online shopping.\nThe other reality many people are realizing is it\u2019s no good to whip out a black (or gold) card if you\u2019re eating at a second-rate restaurant. And that is where other companies are trying to swoop in to win over consumers.\nAtlas has developed a devoted following of yuppy types since its launch in 2019. CEO Patrick Mrozowski told me he believes that people are choosing his card because he provides a valuable service.\n\u201cWe are a concierge company first and a credit card company second,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been focused on building an amazing concierge service, hiring the best travel agents, and building personal relationships with restaurants.\u201d\nThose relationships have resulted in members getting some of the most competitive reservations in the city, like the Corner Store.\nThis story is part of NYNext, an indispensable insider insight into the innovations, moonshots and political chess moves that matter most to NYC\u2019s power players (and those who aspire to be).\nOther cards, like the Centurion, do provide perks \u2014 complimentary hotel and airline upgrades, free access to airport lounges, a club in New York City, the promise of aspiration reservations, and annual credits at Saks Fifth Avenue \u2014 but not typically at the level of Atlas.\nMeanwhile, the Bilt Rewards card has distinguished itself by emphasizing community engagement over traditional credit card offerings and has partnerships with local restaurants like Delmonico\u2019s and fitness studios like SoulCycle.\nAnother trend that is complicating things for high-end credit card companies is the fact that big spenders are spreading out purchases between multiple cards.\nZach Perrett, the CEO of Plaid, which provides technology to help connect bank accounts to fintech apps for over half of banked Americans, told me he is seeing people using half a dozen cards.\n\u201cPeople are connecting four or five, six or seven credit cards into a budgeting application,\u201d Perret told me. \u201cSome of this is because you want to spend money on the card that is relevant to the thing that you\u2019re purchasing. Let\u2019s say you have a Delta card, you want to put your travel on your Delta card.\u201d\nOne person who recently canceled his black card and is now splitting purchases among a Delta card, a Chase Sapphire card and a handful of other cards said it was like paying for a club you never use.\n\u201cThe only benefit was the airport lounges, but now those have fallen off a cliff \u2026 I never used any of the other benefits they touted like personal shopping,\u201d he explained. \u201cI paid more for this than most of my private club memberships in the city \u2014 I couldn\u2019t justify it anymore.\u201d"

      "text": "FCC greenlights $8.4B sale of CBS parent Paramount to Skydance after Trump suit settled, DEI axed\nThe Federal Communications Commission on Thursday gave the green light to the $8.4 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media \u2013 finally clearing the way for a deal that had been throttled by allegations of bias against CBS News.\nThe merger, expected to be completed in the next few weeks, will give independent film studio Skydance control of CBS, Paramount Pictures, the Paramount+ streaming service, as well as cable channels that include MTV, Nickelodeon and Comedy Central.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to celebrate now,\u201d a source close to Skydance told The Post. \u201cWe\u2019re all beat up. Just exhuasted, but it was well worth it. The next step is to close the deal early by Aug. 7.\u201d\nThe approval from the FCC, headed by President Trump-nominated chair Brendan Carr, comes three weeks after Paramount paid $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump over a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris that aired in October.\nHelping to seal the thumbs up from the FCC, by a 2-1 vote, were assurances from Skydance CEO David Ellison, the son of billionaire Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and investment partner RedBird Capital, of their commitment to unbiased journalism that represents diverse viewpoints.\nSkydance said it would appoint an ombudsman to evaluate complaints of editorial bias or other concerns about CBS in an effort to promote transparency and increased accountability.\nParamount also eliminated its diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives to align with the Trump administration\u2019s view that such affirmative action policies are discriminatory.\n\u201cAmericans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,\u201d Carr wrote in a statement Thursday.\n\u201cIt is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance\u2019s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.\u201d\nBoth Skydance and Paramount declined to comment after the news was announced late Thursday.\nMedia heiress Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of Paramount Global, is set to receive $1.75 billion in cash once the deal closes and she will exit the merged company\u2019s board of directors.\nThe FCC\u2019s approval to transfer broadcast licenses for 28 owned-and-operated CBS television stations to the new owners comes a week after CBS canceled \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\u201d calling it a \u201cpurely a financial decision.\u201d\nThe top-rated late-night show had reportedly been losing roughly $40 million a year.\nTrump had sued Paramount for $20 billion, alleging the Harris interview had been deceptively edited in order to interfere with the 2024 election.\nCBS denied any wrongdoing but settled the lawsuit in order to avoid a costly legal battle that could potentially hold up its mega-merger with Skydance.\nEarlier this week, Trump said the settlement was actually for $36 million, with the new owners agreeing to spend $20 million in public service ads for pro-MAGA causes.\n\u201cAfter months of cowardly capitulation to this administration, Paramount finally got what it wanted,\u201d said Democratic FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the dissenting voter for the merger.\nUnder the deal, Skydance \u2013 which has produced blockbuster hits \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d and \u201cMission:Impossible -The Final Reckoning\u201d \u2013 and Gerry Cardinale\u2019s RedBird Capital will buy Redstone\u2019s shares of National Amusements, Paramount\u2019s majority owner.\nThen, Skydance will merge with Paramount to become \u201cParamount Skydance Corp.\u201d It will be controlled by the Ellison family but will remain publicly traded.\nDavid Ellison will take over as chairman and chief executive, while Jeff Shell, a former CEO of NBCUniversal, will grab the reins as president.\nRedstone served as Paramount\u2019s chair starting in 2019, when she reunited two family-controlled media companies, Viacom and CBS, which had been separated for more than a dozen years.\nAt the time, the daughter of the late media mogul Sumner Redstone hoped to better position the company to compete with the world\u2019s entertainment giants.\nParamount has since shed billions of dollars in market valuation as it struggled to navigate an entertainment business upended by the streaming video revolution."

      "text": "Why Trump is starting \u2018not to give a crap\u2019 if TikTok goes dark \u2014 at least briefly\nPresident Trump is starting \u201cnot to give a crap\u201d if TikTok briefly goes dark as the end to the latest ban extension looms, On The Money has learned.\nTrump has tired of China dangling TikTok as a carrot to gain an advantage in ongoing trade talks over tariffs, people with knowledge of the discussions said.\nThe two sides have been close to a trade deal, Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have said in recent days, ahead of next Tuesday\u2019s deadline for an agreement.\nBut those talks could also stretch into the fall as they hammer out the final details, Bessent has suggested.\nThat\u2019s why the betting inside the TikTok deal pool is that there\u2019s a 50-50 shot it fades to black come the Sept. 17 deadline for a TikTok deal \u2013 at least for a while until both Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping settle on a trade pact that includes keeping the app live.\nYou might be thinking that Trump just might kick the can down the road with another executive order extension, right?\nWell not so fast, I am told, including by one person close to the TikTok talks who relayed the lack of \u201ccrap\u201d Trump feels if the video-sharing app is briefly yanked.\nThe deal only works if US investors are ready to put up tens of billions of dollars to buy the app from the Chinese company ByteDance, and if the Chinese are willing to give up enough control to satisfy the ban law.\nInvestors, however, are getting nervous over the multiple extensions by Trump that appear to be circumventing established law.\nThey fear there might come a point when Congress says enough.\nAlso, China wants to retain a minority stake in the company and ownership of the all-important app that keeps users engaged by offering them a nonstop supply of preferred videos.\nInvestors are hearing from China-hawks in Congress \u2014 those who really believe the app\u2019s user data is used by the Chinese surveillance state for spy-craft purposes \u2014 that even a minority stake by the Chinese might violate the law.\nIf so, and if they agreed to a deal, these investors could be on the hook for hundreds of billions of dollars of liability if let\u2019s say a less deal-friendly DOJ after Trump leaves office brings a case given the way the ban law is written.\nSome private investors are demanding indemnification or their out.\nTrump may also be losing patience with the whole TikTok saga. He has touted that he has multiple buyers to create what is essentially a new US company to keep it alive, but people involved in the deal doubt that he will allow Xi to use it as a bargaining chip in the broader trade deal, I am told.\nHe isn\u2019t going to give up a lot just to keep TikTok alive, they predict.\nA White House spokesman had no comment.\nTikTok and its estimated 170 million US users got a new lease on life after its once fiercest critic, Trump, pulled a major U-turn. He wanted it banned when he was president the first time, believing it was used by the Chinese surveillance state for nefarious purposes.\nMore recently, he wanted it saved after he came to believe pro-Trump messaging on the app helped him win in 2024 by turning a swath of TikTok\u2019s youngish users into die-hard MAGA supporters.\nJust hours into his second term, Trump overruled bipartisan legislation signed into law by President Biden and upheld by the Trump-friendly Supreme Court that banned the app unless it divested from the Chinese by Jan. 19.\nThrough executive orders he has extended the life of the app several times since."

      "text": "Uber received sexual misconduct reports every eight minutes during six-year period: unsealed court docs\nUber received more than 400,000 complaints of sexual assault or sexual misconduct in the US against the ride-hailing app\u2019s drivers between 2017 and 2022 \u2014 far more than the 12,522 the company disclosed publicly, according to a blockbuster report.\nThe attacks amounted to one nearly every eight minutes, the New York Times reported, citing unsealed court records.\nThe claims are contained in documents that were recently unsealed as part of massive litigation against Uber, which has long promoted itself as one of the safest transportation options available.\nMore than 2,300 victims from across the country have joined together in one big case, accusing the company of failing to screen drivers properly, ignoring warning signs and putting profits over passenger safety.\nThe victims combined their complaints into a consolidated multidistrict litigation whereby major trial motions such as discovery are streamlined \u2014 though each individual plaintiff must still prove their case.\nA judge ruled in July that these cases can move forward, and the first trials \u2014 known as bellwether trials \u2014 are scheduled to begin in San Francisco federal court in December.\nThe Post has sought comment from attorneys for the plaintiffs.\nUber denies claims it hid sexual assault data, arguing that most of the 400,000 reports from 2017 to 2022 were minor, unaudited or false. The company said the reported incidents amounted to just 0.006% of total trips.\n\u201cThe most serious reports were even rarer, at 0.00002%, or 1 in 5 million,\u201d Uber stated.\nHannah Nilles, Uber\u2019s head of safety for the Americas, acknowledged to the Times that roughly 75% of these reports involved what she termed \u201cless serious\u201d incidents, including inappropriate comments about appearance, unwanted flirting or explicit language.\nShe also noted that the reports haven\u2019t been independently audited and could potentially include fraudulent claims from users seeking refunds.\nThe company has not released data on any incidents since 2022, though reports of sexual attacks have increased, according to court records cited by the Times.\nIn one harrowing incident in December 2023, a woman in Houston alleged that she was raped by her Uber driver after a ride that was supposed to last 22 minutes ended five hours later at a Motel 6.\nUber\u2019s systems sent three automated notifications during suspicious stops, but the woman did not respond, and the driver, who was previously accused twice of misconduct, completed the ride at 2:01 a.m., the records show.\nIn May and July last year, Uber documented cases where drivers allegedly assaulted intoxicated passengers \u2014 including a driver in St. Louis accused of forcing a passenger to perform oral sex before picking up other riders.\nAccording to internal documents, Uber officials were lax in implementing safety reforms that were recommended by the company\u2019s own data scientists, including mandatory video recording and pairing female passengers with female drivers.\nDespite developing sophisticated safety tools that proved effective in testing, Uber delayed or chose not to implement some of the most promising solutions, the Times reported.\nThe company created an algorithmic system called Safety Risk Assessed Dispatch that could anticipate 15% of sexual assaults in its basic ride service during Los Angeles testing in 2018.\nInternal presentations described it as potentially the \u201cmost effective intervention for preventing sexual assaults.\u201d\nHowever, a 2024 internal document revealed a critical flaw in the technology, which \u201cstill dispatched trips identified as high-risk.\u201d\nA company official told the Times that completely blocking high-risk trips, such as late-night pickups from bars, would strand many people and potentially encourage dangerous alternatives like drunk driving.\nThe documents also revealed that Uber\u2019s safety decisions were influenced by priorities including user base growth, lawsuit avoidance and protecting its business model that classifies drivers as independent contractors rather than employees, according to the Times.\nThis distinction proves crucial for the company\u2019s financial structure, as contractors don\u2019t receive benefits, oversight or employment protections that traditional workers would have.\n\u201cOur purpose/goal is not to be the police,\u201d stated a 2021 internal brainstorming document about global safety standards.\n\u201cOur bar is much lower and our goal is to protect the company and set the tolerable risk level for our operations.\u201d\nThe company\u2019s own research identified clear patterns in sexual assault incidents, according to the Times.\nWomen represent the majority of victims whether they\u2019re passengers or drivers, with attacks typically occurring late at night and on weekends, often involving pickups near bars.\nMale perpetrators usually had histories of sexual misconduct complaints and poor user ratings, according to internal analyses cited by the Times.\nNilles told the Times that Uber expects company data covering 2023 and onward to show that the rate of \u201ccritical sexual assaults\u201d fell to the lowest level in years.\nThe company also defended its record, saying it\u2019s invested billions in safety, cut serious assault rates by 44%, and developed tools like S-RAD to improve driver-passenger matching.\nS-RAD stands for Safety Risk Assessed Dispatch, an internal Uber algorithm designed to improve trip safety by prioritizing better driver-passenger matches based on risk factors.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that Uber has been more transparent on the issue of sexual assault than any other corporation,\u201d the company wrote in a statement."

Live severe weather coverage will also come from them.\u201d\nJust last year, Allen Media issued a round of layoffs for an undisclosed number of employees, citing \u201cstrategic changes.\u201d\nThe Weather Channel also trimmed its workforce in October, and shut down its Spanish-language version as part of \u201cextensive cost-cutting measures.\u201d\nMeanwhile, Allen, the group\u2019s founder and chief executive, has made a handful of unsuccessful bids for major media companies over the past few years.\nLast year, he offered $30 billion to take over Paramount Global.\nIn 2023, he reportedly offered Disney $10 billion for ABC and some of its cable networks.\nHe also reportedly considered making an offer for E.W. Scripps.\nMeteorologists at rival stations have slammed the layoffs and the switch to a single weather feed.\nWhile the change \u201cmay save money in the short term,\u201d it also \u201ctakes away value and credibility in the long term,\u201d Spencer Denton, a meteorologist at rival WVLT in Knoxville, Tenn., said in a post on Facebook.\n\u201cWEATHER is the number one reason most people watch a local newscast,\u201d Denton said. \u201cThese folks are more valuable than some companies realize and I am certain they will land on their feet.\u201d\nA 2019 Pew study found that weather was the most important news topic for viewers."

      "text": "Layoffs at Byron Allen\u2019s media company will hit 12% of workforce: sources\nLayoffs at Byron Allen\u2019s media company this week will affect about 300 employees across its operating divisions, representing 12% of the company\u2019s workforce of 2,500, The Post has learned.\nThe job cuts at Allen Media \u2014 which operates the Weather Channel and owns 12 cable networks and 27 ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC television stations across 21 markets \u2014 had previously not seen a major round of layoffs in its 31-year history, sources said.\nThe comedian-turned-media mogul is undergoing a $100 million cost-cutting initiative, sources said.\nEarlier this week, Allen Media reportedly enacted job cuts that included Rick Semmler, the popular sports director at CBS station WTHI in Terre Haute, Indiana. Allen has also recently sold some of the network\u2019s broadcasting equipment and leased it back, sources said.\nThe job cuts come after Allen bid $14 billion in January for Paramount but never signed a confidentiality agreement to study its financials. Paramount instead signed an exclusive agreement with Skydance Media.\nAllen last July also bid $3 billion for Paramount\u2019s BET Group, meeting its asking price. But Paramount did not engage with him because he did not have committed financing. In 2021, Allen offered to acquire TV station group Tegna for $8 billion until his financing partner Ares Management changed sides and provided winning suitor Soo Kim with a loan of about $460 million to fund the deal.\nMedia ad spending, where Allen Media generates more than 60 percent of its revenue, has been declining at the same time the interest rates Allen Media pays on some of its more than $1 billion of debt are rising, sources said.\nThis week\u2019s layoffs coupled with projected political ad spending in 2024 should give Allen the money needed to buy groups of broadcast stations that are trading at historically low multiples, a source said.\n\u201cAllen Media Group is making strategic changes to better position the company for growth that will result in expense and workforce reductions across all divisions of the company,\u201d an Allen Media spokesman said.\n\u201cAllen Media Group\u2019s brands continue to perform well and in many areas our revenue growth has greatly outpaced the market. We are aligning these changes to drive future business opportunities and support our growth strategies in our rapidly evolving industry.\u201d\nAllen Media, for the moment, is still a distressed company. Its most junior debt presently trades at about 50 cents on the dollar. More senior debt trades at around 90 cents on the dollar. No principal is due until 2027.\nAllen Media in the fourth quarter reported generating $83 million in Ebitda, which is down 19% from the prior year. Moody\u2019s in August 2023 forecast that Allen Media would lose $37 million last year and make $60 million this year.\nThe money it will make in 2024 will now be significantly higher, sources said, perhaps hundreds of millions, and give it some breathing room.\nThe Weather Channel is Allen Media\u2019s largest, most valuable and most widely distributed cable network, reaching nearly 72 million US households, Moody\u2019s said in the August 2023 report.\nThe Weather Channel has faced new pressure from Fox\u2019s Weather Network, which launched in 2021.\nMeanwhile, McDonald\u2019s in February defeated Allen\u2019s $100 million lawsuit, in which he accused the fast-food giant of lying when it pledged to increase national ad spend with black-owned outlets."
