      "feedback": "The article is clear but could be tightened and polished for a stronger hook and better flow. Start the opening paragraph with a more engaging lead—e.g., “If you live in a snowy region, winter tires aren’t just a luxury; they’re a safety necessity.” Remove the redundant “Drivers in temperate climates might be able to get away with fitting all-season tires” sentence and merge its key points into the first paragraph. Correct the typo “good reaosn” to “good reason” and fix “Observe tire line” to the proper brand name (likely “Observe” or “Observe line”). Add a brief citation or link to the source that confirms walnut shells are baked before mixing into the compound. Clarify that the shells are a by‑product of food production and emphasize the environmental benefit (“reduces waste”). Finally, trim the “Scraped Source 1” section to a single concise reference and ensure the article’s categories reflect its focus on automotive tires (e.g., “Automotive > Tires”).",
