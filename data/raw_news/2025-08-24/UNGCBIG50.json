  "content": "Welcome back to our weekly guide to the best new shows and movies! This page is the place for you if you're looking for some top streaming inspiration. Here we've gathered together six shows and films from across all the best streaming services.\n\nThe Thursday Murder Club heads up our picks this week \u2013 a fun and lively slice of cosy crime that's ideal for these late summer evenings. There's also the long-awaited follow-up to the Chris Pratt-starring thriller The Terminal List on Amazon Prime Video, plus a new episode of one of the best new shows on TV right now \u2013 that's Alien: Earth, in case you were wondering\u2013and a twisty new Spanish-language mystery series.\n\nSo if you're looking forward to spending a great night in front of the TV, check out our list below. And when you're done here, why not check out our list of the best shows on Paramount Plus for more streaming inspiration?\n\nRichard Osman's bestselling cosy crime series is brought to the screen via Netflix. Directed by Christopher Columbus, who previously helmed the first two Harry Potter movies, The Thursday Murder Club follows a group of elderly detectives living in a retirement home who band together to solve a brutal slaying. The leads \u2013 played by four acting titans in Helen Mirren, Pierce Brosnan, Ben Kingsley, and Celia Imrie \u2013 come from a diverse range of backgrounds. While Imrie's Joyce Meadowcroft is a retired nurse, Mirren's Elizabeth Best used to be a spy!\n\nIt's all very silly, but The Thursday Murder Club seems precision designed to be a comfort watching classic: witty, warm \u2013 and basically a Sunday teatime TV crime drama writ large and with a killer cast.\n\nThese are the best Netflix movies to watch right now.\n\nWhile the sequel to the original Terminal List is still a little way off, the prequel starts this week. Dark Wolf brings back both Taylor Kitsch as ex-Navy SEAL turned CIA operative Ben Edwards and Chris Pratt as tough SEAL James Reece. Fans of the original will know that the first season hid a pretty big twist, the ramifications of which will be explored here.\n\nAlthough The Terminal List was adapted from novelist Jack Carr's books, this is an all-new story. Fans shouldn't worry too much, though \u2013 Carr remains a producer and writer on the series. And while prequels have a bit of a patchy track record, this looks like essential viewing for fans \u2013 and may even contain a few hints as to the future of the franchise.\n\nRead our list of the best Amazon Prime shows for more recommendations.\n\nAvailable: US\n\nWhere to watch: Paramount Plus\n\nBill Murray and Naomi Watts star in this moving drama. Based on the bestselling novel of the same name by Sigrid Nunez, The Friend follows Iris (Watts), a woman who unexpectedly inherits a dog \u2013 an enormous Great Dane named Apollo \u2013 from her best friend Walter (Murray), following his death. As she comes to terms with Walter's passing and the struggles of her everyday life (including facing eviction from her New York apartment), she begins to form an unexpected bond with Apollo that might just help her through a dark time.\n\nWitty and warm, The Friend was well-received on its brief initial release last year. Now finding a proper home at Paramount Plus, this is a sad, but good-natured look at grief, the legacies that people leave behind, and the relationship between one woman and a very troublesome dog.\n\nIt's a new week and that means another new show about a mysterious disappearance in a coastal town! Two Graves follows Isabel (Kiti M\u00e1nver), the grandmother of one of two girls who have vanished. After two years of waiting for the police to solve the mystery, however, Isabel decides to take the law into her own hands in order to discover what truly happened to the girls.\n\n\"Two Graves is a revenge story led by a character rarely seen at the heart of fiction... a grandmother willing to do whatever it takes to seek justice for the loss of her granddaughter,\" creator Agust\u00edn Mart\u00ednez told Netflix. The Spanish-language drama looks tense and gripping. All three episodes are available to watch on Netflix from August 29.\n\nDiscover the brilliant series that make up our list of the best Netflix shows.\n\nThis Nazi-hunting revenge thriller has rapidly become a modern cult classic. Jorma Tommila stars as Aatami Korpi, a prospector in Lapland with a traumatic past. Things start to look up for Korpi when he strikes gold \u2013 but then he's intercepted by a platoon of Waffen-SS. The Nazis try to rob him, but quickly discover that they've bitten off a lot more than they can chew...\n\nSisu is preposterously violent, in a slightly cartoonish way. Korpi is not immortal, but simply \"refuses to die\" as one character puts it. The same can't be said for the hordes of baddies he encounters. If you're in the mood for something action-packed with a pitch black sense of humor, this is one to watch when it drops on Hulu on August 29. A sequel titled Sisu: Road to Revenge is incoming later this year.\n\nOur list of the best Hulu movies contains some more action classics.\n\nAvailable: US/UK\n\nWhere to watch: Hulu / Disney Plus\n\nThe sci-fi horror series reaches its halfway point. Last week's episode took some time out from the action to help us get to know the \"Lost Boys\" \u2013 a group of children whose minds have been implanted into synthetic bodies. While Wendy (a phenomenal Sydney Chandler) has been reunited with her brother Joe (Alex Lawther), the rest of the group are starting to come apart at the seams. Meanwhile, the threat of the recovered aliens grows even stronger.\n\nAfter a relentlessly-paced first two episodes, last week's instalment and this one are really about turning the screws on the characters. Expect more hints about Wendy's apparent connection to the Xenomorphs and further developments in the plot surrounding Slightly (Adarsh Gourav) and Morrow (Babou Ceesay). Alien: Earth remains a tense, well-acted, and beautifully made nightmare.\n\nFind out more about this terrifying show with our Alien: Earth review.\n\nLooking for something else to watch?

      "text": "The best new shows and movies streaming this week on Netflix, Prime Video, HBO Max, and more\nCheck out our guide to the best movies and shows streaming this week, August 18\u201324\nAnother week means another instalment of our guide to the best new shows and movies! If you're looking for some streaming inspiration, then here it is. On this page we've gathered together a list of six shows and films from across the best streaming services to keep you entertained over the next few days.\nIt's a big week for DC fans, as the second season of Peacemaker is finally here! The new run sees our morally-flexible hero enter another dimension, while his past comes calling. Like the first season it's a great blend of laughter, tears, and some exciting action. There are several other new shows on offer this week, too, including political thriller Hostage on Netflix.\nSo if you're keen to put your feet off and have a great night in front of the TV, check out our list below. And when you're done here, why not check out our list of the best shows on Paramount Plus for more streaming inspiration.\nPeacemaker season 2\nAvailable: US/UK\nWhere to watch: HBO Max (US), Sky Max/NOW TV (UK)\nThe long-awaited second season of this adult superhero series finally arrives on HBO Max this week, and sees John Cena's tormented antihero join the rapidly expanding DCU. He may have helped save the world last time around \u2013 although even that is up for debate \u2013 but things have not gotten any easier for Cena's Chris Smith/Peacemaker. Something has happened between him and Harcourt (Jennifer Holland), and the other members of the \"11th Street Kids\" are all grappling with difficult personal problems. When Peacemaker discovers a parallel universe where he's considered a hero \u2013 and where his Dad is still alive \u2013 it's all too much for him to ignore.\nPeacemaker season 2 is every bit as hilarious, violent, and emotional as the first run. Cena's character, in particular, remains a delightful contradiction: brash, offensive, violent \u2013 yet also kind and loveable. It's great to have the gang back.\nFind out more about the new series in our Peacemaker season 2 review.\nHostage\nAvailable: UK/US\nWhere to watch: Netflix\nTwo national leaders butt heads as they struggle to save a hostage in this pacy new political thriller. Suranne Jones plays British Prime Minister Abigail Dalton, whose husband Alex (Ashley Thomas) is kidnapped by a gang of masked terrorists. They want Dalton to resign, and they're not afraid to kill. Also standing in the PM's way is the hardline French president, Vivienne Toussaint (Julie Delpy).\nWill Dalton and Toussaint be able to put aside their differences to save Alex? And why do the terrorists have such a specific vendetta against her? Jones and Delpy make for a formidable leading duo in this addictive, five-episode series. The whole thing is available to stream on Netflix on August 21.\nCheck out our guide to the best Netflix shows.\n007: Road To A Million season 2\nAvailable: US/UK\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime Video\nOK, so it may not be quite as exciting as Denis Villeneuve's upcoming James Bond movie, but Prime Video's 007-themed reality show is still fun. The premise of 007: Road To A Million is that Succession's Brian Cox plays the Controller, who tasks the contestants with different Bond-themed missions around the world in order to win a cool \u00a31 million. As the trailer for the new season reveals, these involve bungee jumps off a dam (as seen in Goldeneye), scrambling to the top of various tall buildings, and other you-could n't-pay-me-to-do-it stunts.\nAlong the way, the players must eliminate the competition, get to grips with various gadgets, drive fast cars and speed boats, and generally \"find their inner Bond.\" It's all extremely silly, but the premise captures the globe-trotting aspect of the Bond movies well enough to tide 007 fans over until the new movie.\nRead our list of the best Amazon Prime shows for more recommendations.\nJohn Wick Chapter 4\nAvailable: US\nWhere to watch: Hulu\nFew franchise films are still kicking ass with their fourth instalment, but John Wick: Chapter 4 is up there with the best of the series. In fact, it may even be the best. Wick (Keanu Reeves) is on the run again, with Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd's Marquis de Gramont putting a hefty bounty on his head. Wick heads to Japan in seek of assistance, but runs into the assassin Caine (Donnie Yen) \u2013 and that's only the start of his problems.\nDirected once again by Chad Stahelski, John Wick: Chapter 4 refines the series' formula to its absolute essentials. Wick comes up against a series of villains that he has to take out in action scenes that are full-blooded and phenomenally well-choreographed. Reeves, meanwhile, continues to be a laconic but soulful lead, facing off against seemingly insurmountable odds one more time.\nFind out more about this film with our John Wick: Chapter 4 review.\nInvasion season 3\nAvailable: US/UK\nWhere to watch: Apple TV Plus\nThe third season of Apple TV Plus's slow burn alien invasion thriller finally unites its cast \u2013 who, up to this point, have been scattered around the world. It's two years since the alien attack on Earth was seemingly thwarted \u2013 but is the threat truly over? In season 3 a group of survivors must enter the mothership to find out more. Golshifteh Farahani's Aneesha Malik, Shamier Anderson's Trevante Cole, and Shioli Kutsuna's Mitsuki Yamato all return, and are joined by a new regular played by Erika Alexander.\nInvasion debuted in 2021 and has been a quiet success for Apple TV Plus. Not as flashy as some of the streamer's other major sci-fi shows, like Foundation, it has still found a strong following and these 10 episodes look like the most exciting yet.\nFind more to watch with our list of the best Apple TV Plus shows.\nThe 355\nAvailable: US/UK\nWhere to watch: Netflix\nJessica Chastain heads up an impressive cast that also includes the likes of Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Sebastian Stan, Lupita Nyong'o, and Diane Kruger in this action-packed espionage thriller. Chastain plays Mason Browne, a CIA operative tasked with putting together an international team of female agents in order to retrieve a piece of technology that can access any digital system on the planet (so, a magic MacGuffin, basically!) that has fallen into the hands of Jason Flemyng's crime lord, Elijah Clarke.\nThe 355 was not met with much acclaim on its release in 2022, but if you're after a pacy action thriller with a few twists and turns, not to mention that star-studded cast list, then it's worth giving this one a go. It didn't revolutionize the genre, but there's still a fair amount of entertainment to be had here.\nThese are the best Netflix movies to watch right now.\nLooking for something else to watch?

      "text": "The 25 best shows on Paramount Plus to watch right now\nFrom Dexter to Yellowjackets, here are 25 of the best shows on Paramount Plus to watch in August 2025\nTrying to find a list of the best shows on Paramount Plus? You're in the right place. On this page we've selected 25 of our favorite shows on the streamer, covering a range of different genres.\nParamount Plus may not be quite as well known as Netflix, Disney Plus, or Amazon Prime Video, but it's certainly one of the best streaming services around. It has a wealth of great new shows, like Star Trek: Strange New Worlds. which is currently airing its brilliant third season, MobLand, Tulsa King, and Colin From Accounts. It's also the home of an incredible back catalog of titles. Paramount Plus is a goldmine for comedy fans in particular, with both Cheers and Frasier here, along with South Park, Nathan For You, and more.\nSo if you're looking to get hooked by a new TV obsession, check our list below. And when you're done reading this, take a look at our guide to the best Paramount Plus movies and the best best HBO Max shows.\n25. 1923\nThere's no arguing with the casting of this Yellowstone prequel, which stars Harrison Ford and Helen Mirren, alongside former James Bond Timothy Dalton. Set in 1923 (obviously), the series follows the ever-troubled Dutton family through a period of great change and hardship in Montana.\nFor fans of Taylor Sheridan's Western franchise this will be reassuringly familiar stuff. That's no bad thing, though. Tough and exciting, 1923 also expands the scope of the saga, moving some of the action outside of the States with subplots set in Africa and at sea. And there's no doubt that casting a pair of bona fide movie legends in the leads lends the show some real class and gravitas.\n24. Tulsa King\nYear: 2022\nSeasons: 2\nRocky star Sylvester Stallone made the move to TV with this two-fisted crime drama. Stallone plays Dwight \"The General\" Manfredi, a New York mobster who has just served 25 long years in prison for murder. On his release he moves to Tulsa and tries to start again \u2013 but that's going to mean dealing with a nasty biker gang and figuring out his relationship with Stacy Beale (Andrea Savage), an ATF agent who is investigating Dwight.\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nCreated by Yellowstone's Taylor Sheridan, Tulsa King is something of a throwback. If you're after the new Sopranos, then you're in the wrong place. If, on the other hand, you want a mob drama with action, humor, and some slightly bananas plotting, then Tulsa King is the show for you.\n23. Knuckles\nYear: 2024\nSeasons: 1\nFew expected the Sonic the Hedgehog movies to be as much fun as they turned out to be. Remarkably, last year's six-episode Knuckles spinoff show was even better. Focused on Sonic's hot-headed echidna warrior pal, once again voiced by Idris Elba, the Knuckles series combined live action with animation and comedy with some real emotional stakes.\nThe key to all this is Adam Pally's Wade Whipple \u2013 Knuckles' partner on a bizarre road trip, and the heart of the series, whether battling G.U.N. agents Mason and Willoughby, or getting caught up in a bizarre dream sequence that saw British comedy legend Julian Barratt performing a rock opera retelling of Knuckles' backstory with singer Michael Bolton. Inventive, hilarious, and often super weird, Knuckles proved that there's still a lot of life in the Sonic franchise.\n22. Evil\nYear: 2019\nSeasons: 4\nOver its four seasons this quirky horror series quietly became one of the most reliably entertaining shows on Paramount Plus. Forensic psychologist Dr. Kristen Bouchard (Katja Herbers) joins forces with a Catholic priest David Acosta (Mike Colter) to investigate reports of supernatural events. Pitted against them is Michael Emerson (who played the villainous Ben Linus on Lost) as a rival psychologist and devout evil-doer \u2013 not exactly playing against type here.\nWith a nice mix of one-off episodes and ongoing arcs, Evil really does feel like The Catholic X-Files. It's not afraid to mix humor in with the laughs and the leads are compelling, especially the tormented Acosta, who is grappling with substance issues. Evil wrapped up its final season last year, meaning the whole is available to watch on the streamer right now.\n21. MobLand\nYear: 2025\nSeasons: 1\nTom Hardy, Helen Mirren, and Pierce Brosnan \u2013 now there's a cast! In MobLand, Hardy plays Harry Da Souza \u2013 a fixer for prominent crime family, the Harrigans. Led by the deadly duo of Conrad (Pierce Brosnan) and Maeve Harrigan (Helen Mirren), this Irish gang have a stranglehold on the drugs and guns in London, but they're also prone to getting into trouble. That's where Harry comes in \u2013 threatening, cajoling and sometimes straight up beating anyone who gets in his way, all while having to deal with a disintegrating marriage.\nMobLand is fast-paced and fun, aided by the natural charisma of its leads. Giving it extra gangster cred is the fact that the season's first two episodes (of 10) are directed by Guy Ritchie \u2013 no stranger, of course, to this sort of thing. The show was an instant hit, which means the Harringans will be back in action for a second season in the nearish future.\n20. Yellowjackets\nYear: 2021\nSeasons: 3\nThis gripping \u2013 and often unexpectedly very funny \u2013 mystery drama takes place in two different time zones. In the '90s, an all-girl football team's plane crashes in a mountainous wilderness. With seemingly no hope of rescue, the survivors turn to increasingly desperate measures to survive, including cannibalism. In the present day, we learn that some of the survivors eventually made it back to civilisation, but their adult lives are, if anything, even more perilous...\nYellowjackets has a perfect first season and two almost as good follow ups. It's a brilliantly unpredictable and often ruthlessly dark thriller with an exceptional cast. Christina Ricci impresses as Misty, shy and bullied as a teenager, now a master manipulator. But it's Melanie Lynskey's increasingly off the rails Shauna who has grown into the rotten heart of an increasingly psychotic series.\nSeen all of Yellowjackets but still have questions? Check out our guide to the ending of Yellowjackets season 3.\n19. Dexter: Resurrection\nYear: 2025\nSeasons: 1\n21 years after he first slashed his way onto our screens, serial killer Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) is back in a new spinoff series. Somewhat remarkably \u2013 considering this is the fourth show in the franchise \u2013 the still-airing Resurrection has turned out to be just as good as the groundbreaking original.\nThe show picks up where Dexter: New Blood left off. That ended with Dex seemingly fatally shot and his son Harrison (Jack Alcott) moving to New York. Well, it turns out that our killer with a conscious survived and in Resurrection he's both keeping a watchful eye on his son and taking out more deadly killers, just like in the old days. It's fun, it's violent, and it's a big improvement on the last few seasons of the original. Perhaps, in time, it may even surpass it.\n18. South Park\nYear: 1997\nSeasons: 27\nAmerica's most outrageous animated series is as filthy and hilarious as when it debuted back in 1997. Trey Parker and Matt Stone's hands-on approach to the series means that, while it has its fair share of weaker episodes, it has remained remarkably consistent over an incredible 27 seasons now.\nSouth Park follows the adventures of four young boys (along with their schoolmates and parents) in the titular town. There are occasional aliens and supernatural events, but mostly the series is about poking satirical fun at everyday life. In that regard, Parker and Stone go out of their way to offend everybody. And while it's fair to say that some of South Park's gags have aged poorly, it remains an impressively reliable joke machine \u2013 and one that has garnered a lot of recent headlines.\nThese are the 25 best South Park episodes, mmkay?\n17. Halo\nYear: 2022\nSeasons: 2\nHalo was one of the flagship shows created to introduce viewers to the fledgling Paramount Plus. Inspired by the famous video game series, it follows the adventures of Master Chief Petty Officer John-117 (Pablo Schreiber), a super-soldier in the war against the alien Covenant.\nThe wider Halo franchise has some fairly in-depth lore, established in both the games and expanded universe novels. The Halo show sensibly streamlines a lot of this, taking place in a separate \"Silver Timeline.\" This decision alienated some hardcore fans but made sense for a show aimed at a wider audience. After a solid but occasionally a little sluggish first season, the show really matured in its second year. The action stepped up and so did the drama, resulting in a show that did the legendary FPS justice. Sadly, it was axed after just two seasons.\n16. Star Trek: Strange New Worlds\nYear: 2022\nSeasons: 3\nThe best of the many recent Star Trek spin-offs is this refreshingly old-school space adventure show. Set a few years before the original 1960s Trek, Strange New Worlds follows the crew of a pre-Captain Kirk USS Enterprise. In the captain's chair is Christopher Pike (Anson Mount), a charming, immaculately coiffed leader who we know will eventually face a terrible fate. Alongside him is Rebecca Romijn as Pike's first officer, nicknamed Number One, and Ethan Peck as a young Spock.\nStrange New Worlds mainly trades in one-off episodes, which makes it the easiest Trek to get into for new viewers, but there are also some neat arcs ticking along in the background \u2013 such as Pike learning of his seemingly inescapable fate. It's also blessed with a truly lovable central cast. The third season is now airing weekly on the streamer.\nUnsure where Strange New Worlds sits in relation to Deep Space 9 or The Next Generation? Check out our Star Trek timeline.\n15. Nathan For You\nYear: 2013\nSeasons: 4\nNathan Fielder broke onto our screens with this jaw-dropping Comedy Central series. The premise is simple: Nathan is here to help give stalling businesses a boost with some truly out of the box ideas like, say, convincing an ice cream parlour to trial a new poo flavored product; or reinventing a caricature artist as a mean \"King of the Sting\" who only draws unflattering portraits; or creating a sleeper cell of deliberately bad Uber drivers...\nNathan For You goes so far into cringe comedy extremes that, at times, it can be genuinely a little hard to watch. But at its best, this sublime series blurred the lines between fact and fiction in a truly dazzling way. It also set the stage for Fielder's excellent, equally boundary-pushing future shows The Rehearsal and The Curse.\n14. Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\nYear: 1993\nSeasons: 7\nWhile it may not be as much of a crowd-pleaser as the shows that spawned it, Deep Space Nine is arguably the connoisseur's choice of Star Trek show. More sombre than its predecessors, DS9 broke new ground by being the first Trek show to not really, well, trek anywhere. Instead, it took place largely on the titular space station \u2013 a rundown relic in orbit around the planet Bajor.\nAvery Brooks stars as Benjamin Sisko, a Starfleet officer who finds himself torn between his duties to the Federation and a growing loyalty to the Bajorans. Meanwhile a race of alien shapeshifters has set their sights on the Alpha Quadrant, eventually leading to all out war. Rather than being grimdark Star Trek, however, Deep Space 9 was all about stress-testing Starfleet's much-vaunted moral principles. It also showed a commitment to serialized storytelling long before that was the prevailing TV trend.\n13. Cheers\nYear: 1982\nSeasons: 11\nThis beloved sitcom is far more than just the show that spawned Frasier. Set in Boston, and focused on the titular basement pub, Cheers was built around the will they/won't they romance between down to earth bartender Sam (Ted Danson) and Diane Chambers' more academically-minded Shelley. They weren't the only great characters though \u2013 in fact the pub was stocked full of them, from Nicholas Colasanto's slow-witted Coach, to Rhea Perlman's belligerent cocktail waitress Carla, and Norm (George Wendt), a perennial fixture at the bar.\nCheers ran for 11 seasons and 275 episodes, and remained a remarkably consistent joke machine throughout. It weathered major cast changes \u2013 Colasanto passed away suddenly in 1985, while Diane Chambers left the series to pursue a movie career. She was replaced by Kirstie Alley's Rebecca, who stayed till the end of the series. It also introduced the world to a certain neurotic psychiatrist played by Kelsey Grammer \u2013 but that's a whole other story...\n12. Ghosts UK\nYear: 2019\nSeasons: 5\nThis supernatural sitcom has quietly become one of the UK's most beloved TV exports. Cash-strapped couple Alison (Charlotte Ritchie) and Mike (Kiell Smith-Bynoe) unexpectedly inherit a crumbling mansion from a previously unknown relative and move in only to find that it is absolutely riddled with ghosts. These specters date from different time periods connected to the house and while they initially try to spook Alison and Mike, they eventually all become firm friends \u2013 albeit friends that often bicker and squabble.\nOver its five seasons, the BBC version struck the balance between family-friendly silliness, some surprisingly cutting gags, and real emotional heft, with the show never forgetting that loss is at the core of its premise. The US version, which started in 2021, doesn't quite have the same heart, but the strength of the show's premise and a larger cast means that it's still a fun and often inspired watch.\n11. The Good Wife\nYear: 2009\nSeasons: 7\nThis legal drama followed the life and career of Julianna Margulies' Alicia Florrick, the wife of a State's Attorney caught up in a sex scandal. Initially deciding to stick with her husband while returning to work as a lawyer after more than a decade raising kids, Alicia faces many personal and professional challenges, not least her attraction to Will Gardner (Josh Charles), a partner at the firm she works for.\nThe Good Wife ran for seven seasons and was never afraid to change things up a little. Alicia's marriage flounders. She embarks on a turbulent relationship with Will, and starts her own law firm, before eventually running for State's Attorney herself. The series was always smart and engaging, mixing real world issues \u2013 vote-rigging, gender inequality, and more \u2013 with high drama. A sequel series, The Good Fight, followed Christine Baranski's Diane Lockhart, and ran for six seasons.\n10. Frasier\nYear: 1993\nSeasons: 11\nIs Frasier the best TV spinoff ever made? It's certainly one of the most successful, running for 11 seasons between 1993 and 2004. Kelsey Grammar reprises his Cheers role as Dr. Frasier Crane, a fussy radio psychiatrist brought down to Earth when he is forced to take in his father Martin, a retired cop played with earthy charm by the late John Mahoney. Also in the mix is Martin's live-in carer Daphne (Jane Leeves), and Niles (David Hyde Pierce), Frasier's even snootier younger brother.\nFrasier strikes the perfect balance between sitcom farce and genuine emotion. The relationship between the Crane boys and their father is strained, but loving, while the tentative romance between Daphne and Niles becomes the heart of the show. Frasier relaunched in 2024 for a new series, which ran for two seasons. It's better than its critics might suggest, but doesn't touch the original.\n9. RuPaul's Drag Race\nYear: 2009\nSeasons: 17\nThe only reality show on this list is this wildly OTT, gloriously camp, and endlessly entertaining competition. Every season the iconic drag queen RuPaul, and a group of judges, pit a group of up and coming queens against each other in a series of challenges, involving makeovers, lip syncs, and more. The contestants are whittled down to just a few finalists who display the most \"charisma, uniqueness, nerve and talent\". until RuPaul declares America's next drag superstar.\nDrag Race is a world-conquering phenomenon that has so far run for 17 seasons of the original, and numerous spin-offs. The reason is simple: it's just a huge amount of fun. What started as an enjoyably scrappy and low budget show now has real glitz and glamor, but its cheeky sense of humor remains intact, as does RuPaul's deadpan delivery.\n8. The Twilight Zone\nYear: 1959\nSeasons: 5\nThere have been many horror and sci-fi anthology shows over the years, but none have made as much of an impact as The Twilight Zone. Created and hosted by screenwriter Rod Serling, The Twilight Zone ran for five game-changing seasons and 156 episodes between 1959 and 1964, with Serling penning many of the episodes himself. Not only was the series a masterclass in how to tell one-and-done stories week-after-week, it was also remarkably consistent. The stories would move from horror to fantasy to sci-fi to comedy, but you were pretty much always guaranteed a rattling good yarn \u2013 not to mention a sting in the tale.\nMany have tried to replicate the success of the original Twilight Zone \u2013 it's been revived no less than three times, but there's no denying that Stirling's original remains the best and a true television landmark.\nOne of our writers reminisces about two of The Twilight Zone's best episodes.\n7. Key & Peele\nYear: 2012\nSeasons: 5\nBefore he rebranded himself as the master of smart, subversive and satirical horror films like Get Out and Nope, Jordan Peele was most famous for his work with Keegan-Michael Key. Together, the pair made five seasons of sketch show Key & Peele for Comedy Central, a relentlessly funny shotgun blast of absurdist ideas and social commentary.\nSumming up a sketch show is a difficult task, so instead we'll suggest you check out a few specific sketches to get a flavor of the show, all of which are available on the Comedy Central YouTube: the Gremlins 2 brainstorm from season 5, the Obama meet and greet from season 4 (the former US President has even praised Peele's impression of him), and the blisteringly funny pizza order from season 2. Key & Peele's ability to quickly create fully realized characters is unmatched, and their show is a fountain of hilarious ideas.\n6. Dexter\nYear: 2006\nSeasons: 8\nThis serial killer thriller, inspired by Jeff Lindsay's novel series, has an irresistible premise. Over eight seasons Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) struggles to keep three very different parts of his life separate. To his friends and relatives he is a kind family man. At work he is a forensic technician working with the Miami Police. But by night Dexter is a serial murderer, albeit one with a very specific MO: he only kills killers.\nDexter was an immediate sensation when it launched in 2006, and for its first four seasons it was a remarkably gripping watch. Alas, its final years were less surefooted, leading to an infamously awful final episode. Happily, that was not the end for Dexter. Hall reprised the role in 2021 for Dexter: New Blood, a sequel miniseries that helped clear the original show's name, while another sequel, Dexter: Resurrection, is set to drop later this year.\n5. Twin Peaks\nYear: 1990\nSeasons: 2\nThere's a reason why Twin Peaks remains so beloved, 35 years after it changed the face of TV. Its blend of surreal murder mystery, soap opera, and extra-dimensional horror was groundbreaking, and while it inspired countless imitators, nothing quite compares to David Lynch and Mark Frost's baffling, brilliant series. Peaks brought a more mature style to US television when it first aired in 1990 and became an instant smash hit as audiences around the world longed to discover who murdered homecoming queen Laura Palmer.\nTwin Peaks lived fast and died young. Its second season started strong, but once the Palmer mystery had been resolved (against Lynch and Frost's wishes) the show floundered. Still, Lynch made sure it went out in style, giving the show one of TV's greatest endings and a cliffhanger that would pay off 25 years later in the excellent sequel, Twin Peaks: The Return.\n4. Star Trek: The Next Generation\nYear: 1987\nSeasons: 7\nChoosing the best Star Trek series is hard. The original series remains a science fiction classic, while Deep Space 9 steered the franchise into darker, more morally complex territory. But The Next Generation is our pick for a very simple reason: its impeccable, endlessly endearing cast. Patrick Stewart as the legendary Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Jonathan Frakes as charming first officer Will Riker, Michael Dorn as stout Klingon security officer Worf, Marina Sirtis's empathic councillor Deanna Troi \u2013 and on, and on.\nA Star Trek show lives and dies by its crew. And while The Next Generation's first two seasons were... uneven, the Starfleet officers of the Enterprise NCC-1701-D made it worth sticking with. That the show underwent an incredible transformation in its third year, and evolved into one of the smartest and most consistently exciting shows on TV, was the cherry on the cake. The Next Generation secured Star Trek's place in sci-fi history, and established a future for the franchise that continues to this day.\n3. Colin From Accounts\nYear: 2022\nSeasons: 2\nThis Australian comedy has grown into a huge word-of-mouth hit over the last few years. Harriet Dyer plays Ashley Molden and Patrick Brammall is \"Flash\" (real name Gordon Crapp), two singles who meet and embark on a bumpy relationship. So who is the Colin from the title? That's actually the name of a stray dog that Gordon accidentally runs over in the first episode. The two rush the dog to a vet and are faced with the tough decision of either putting him down or adopting him. They choose the latter and name him Colin \"from Accounts Payable, who's working on the big merger.\"\nColin From Accounts's secret sauce is that it mixes its edgy jokes and spiky banter with deep characterization. Both Ashley and Gordon feel like real, flawed, complicated people. And Colin? Well he's just adorable. A third season is currently in production.\n2. The Curse\nYear: 2023\nSeasons: 1\nNathan Fielder follows up the impossibly funny Nathan For You with this brilliant, if absolutely agonizing sort-of-comedy. Whitney (Fielder) and Asher Siegel (Emma Stone) are a married couple who star in a grim reality TV show about a couple who do supposedly good deeds for the people of Espa\u00f1ola, New Mexico. In truth, they are also trying to boost their own business interests, buying and flipping cheap homes for the maximum amount of money.\nUncut Gems' Benny Safdie co-created, co-wrote and also appears in the series, and some of that film's unrelenting tension is palpable here. But The Curse also feels in many ways like the natural next step of the sort of jaw-dropping mix of cringe comedy and cutting satire that Fielder excelled at in Nathan For You, here taken to new extremes. The Curse is so funny, so devastating, and so original that it feels like nothing else on TV.\n1. Twin Peaks: The Return\nYear: 2017\nSeasons: 1\nCreators David Lynch and Mark Frost stepped back into the world of their groundbreaking 1990s hit and found it a much darker, sadder, stranger place with this astonishing limited series. Set 25 years after Kyle MacLachlan's Special Agent Dale Cooper was first trapped in the Black Lodge, the series sees the FBI investigate another murder, one that has direct links back to the town of Twin Peaks. Meanwhile Coop's evil doppelganger is still at large...\nRather than giving us the coffee and cherry pie-fuelled nostalgia-fest that some fans expected, Twin Peaks: The Return feels bracingly new. The story is a novelistic tangle of plots that takes in everything from drug crime in small town America to the first detonation of the atomic bomb, by way of parallel universes, and Michael Cera doing a Marlon Brando impersonation. Co-written and entirely directed by the late, great Lynch, The Return is a singular and uncompromising work, but also one that reminds us of just how powerful, moving, terrifying, and hilarious a TV show can be.\nFor more TV streaming picks, you can read our lists of the best shows on Amazon Prime, the best shows on Disney Plus, and the best shows on Netflix.\nParamount Plus\nWhatever country you're in, it's easy to sign up to Paramount Plus, where you can enjoy a vast library of shows and movies.

      "text": "Alien: Earth release date, trailer, cast, and everything else we know about the Alien TV show\nHere are all the latest details and news that you need to know about FX's new Alien TV show, Alien: Earth\nAlien: Earth is finally here, and despite only releasing a few episodes, it's already become a fast sci-fi obsession of ours. If you've watched all the Alien movies in order, then you'd know that Ridley Scott's original 1979 outing isn't just one of the best horror movies of all time, but also introduced us to a fascinating sci-fi world, complete with terrifying creatures that burst out of chests, hug faces and have a habbit of spitting acid all over the place.\nFor years, xenomorphs have been haunting the big screen, and with prequel stories such as Prometheus building up lore, we're thrilled to see the franchise get a chance to expand with a new series that takes place years before Ellen Ripley's first encounter with the deadly lifeform. With Fargo creator Noah Hawley as showrunner, and some complications around the Alien: Earth timeline, we expect to see some more changes, though, as the show continues. In fact, despite our glowing Alien: Earth review, the changes that we've already seen can get a tad confusing even for the most seasoned Alien fan. So with that in mind, we've decided to create a helpful guide on everything that you need to know about the series as more episodes head our way.\nBelow you'll find information on the Alien: Earth release schedule, a complete cast list, trailers, a spoiler-free plot deep dive, and more. So what are you waiting for? Get ahead of the game and get ready to face some small-screen xenomorphs!\nAlien: Earth release date\nAlien: Earth was released on August 12 in the US and August 13 in the UK. The show is on Hulu in the US and Disney Plus in the UK, with two episodes dropping at once, then the rest following weekly. Season one will finish on September 23 with the release of episode eight.\nFilming on Alien: Earth wrapped in summer 2024, with creator Noah Hawley confirming that the team was busy in post-production shortly afterwards. While editing and adding visual effects on anything sci-fi-related takes time, it makes sense for Alien: Earth to capitalize on the renewed hype for the franchise that the 2024 movie Alien: Romulus created.\nIf you want to keep up with the show, you can also head on over to our guide breaking down the Alien: Earth release schedule.\nAlien: Earth trailer\nThe first teaser trailer for Alien: Earth was a 15-second clip featuring a blood-dripping Xenomorph and ending with a jump scare. We see Planet Earth before its shape slowly turns into a Xenomorph and screeches at the viewer. Because we know that Noah Hawley doesn't play around when it comes to violence (thanks to Fargo) and that he plans to follow the aesthetic from Alien and Aliens, we know this is going to be quite the scary ride.\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nOur best look yet, though, was the official trailer below. This ship has collected five different lifeforms from the darkest corners of the universe,\" Babou Ceesay's Morrow whispers ominously in the clip. Later, we see a couple of characters logging details of a jellyfish-like specimen on a computer, to which its description reads: \"Ocular irises and a tentacle system that can grow or retract at will. The tentacles carry extraordinary strength and are built to climb into and dislodge the eyes of other living organisms.\n\"Once replaced in the eye socket, [it] takes over the ocular pathways to the brain, overriding the neurotransmissions throughout the body,\" it continues. Truly nightmarish stuff.\nWe're still holding out hope that one of the \"five lifeforms\" mentioned turns out to be a Predator, after fans convinced themselves (and subsequently, us) that they could hear the ultimate hunter's iconic snarl in an earlier teaser.\nAlien: Earth plot\nThe new TV series is a prequel to the original 1979 Alien, taking place in 2120 \u2013 just two years before Ellen Ripley encountered her first xenomorph aboard the Nostromo. It's set in an era where \"five corporations \u2013 Prodigy, Weyland-Yutani, Lynch, Dynamic, and Threshold \u2013 wield the power of nations.\"\nIt centers more specifically on Wendy (Sydney Chandler), a synthetic with the body of an adult woman and the mind of a child, who comes face to face with the eponymous creature, after she and a bunch of fellow hybrids are tasked with investigating a crash-landed spaceship in Prodigy City. Thanks to a first-look deep dive from Vanity Fair, we now know that the vessel Wendy and her pals venture into is the USCSS Maginot, a Weyland-Yutani freighter. Ruh roh.\nA new Special Look Trailer for \u2018ALIEN: EARTH\u2019 has been released.#AlienEarth hits Disney+ this Summer! pic.twitter.com/tWVeFJRwtTMarch 22, 2025\nWhile it had previously been reported that Alien: Earth would not bridge the gaps between the Alien timeline, instead focusing on the Weyland-Yutani Corporation's race to develop robotic life, Vanity Fair's write-up paints a slightly different picture.\n\"I don't yet know, in terms of the series from beginning to end, how much time is going to pass or where we're going to end up,\" Hawley told the publication, suggesting that possible future seasons could creep into crossover territory. \"But I do know that at a certain point, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation is going to divert the Nostromo to that planet. We have the opportunity to maybe see what was happening on the other side of that phone call.\"\nOne thing's for certain: we're going to get lots of xenomorph action. \"There's something about seeing a xenomorph in the wilds of Earth with your own eyes,\" Hawley teased to Deadline. \"I can't tell you under what circumstances you'll see that, but you'll see it \u2013 and you're going to lock your door that night.\" We've been promised more xenomorph screentime than any of the movies, and that the show will also include a bunch of different creatures\nThe director also stated that the creature will look different from what we have seen before but will still keep the same silhouette, calling that detail \"sacrosanct.\" Hawley added, \"But some of the elements, as we know, whatever the host is, informs what the final creature is. I just wanted to play around a little bit to make it as scary as it should be.\"\nAs more episodes drop, we'll keep you posted on any big story reveals as they come. In the meantime, we have managed to gather a list of all the Alien: Earth Easter Eggs so far, if you're looking for any potential clues on the direction of the show's narrative.\nAlien: Earth cast\nThe cast for Alien: Earth is stacked with stars who have appeared in several of the best TV shows around, such as Game of Thrones, Shadow and Bone, and Fargo. You may recognize names such as Timothy Olyphant (who starred in the likes of The Mandalorian and Scream 2) or Alex Lawther (as seen in Black Mirror and Andor).\nWhile we don't know specific details on most characters, we've scoured the internet to find out their names. Check out the complete Alien: Earth cast list below:\n- Sydney Chandler as Wendy\n- Alex Lawther as CJ\n- Samuel Blenkin as Boy Kavalier\n- Essie Davis as Dame Silvia\n- Adarsh Gourav as Slightly\n- Kit Young as Tootles\n- Timothy Olyphant as Kirsh\n- David Rysdahl as Arthur\n- Babou Ceesay as Morrow\n- Jonathan Ajayi as Smee\n- Erana James as Curly\n- Lily Newmark as Nibs\n- Di\u00eam Camille as Siberian\n- Adrian Edmondson as Atom Enis\n- Moe Bar-El as Rashidi\n- Sandra Yi Sencindiver\nWhere can I watch Alien: Earth?\nYou can now watch Alien: Earth on Hulu if you are in the US and on Star via Disney Plus if you're not. For UK readers, it seems like Disney Plus will be your go-to.\nGiven how other FX series, such as What We Do In The Shadows, have arrived on Disney Plus or the BBC, we assume that the upcoming Alien series will be heading to either of those two streaming hubs in the future.\nKeep your eyes on this guide as we update you on the latest streaming news.

      "text": "The 10 best movies on Hulu to watch right now\nFrom Die Hard to Inception, here are the best movies on Hulu to watch in August 2025\nWelcome back to our list of the best movies on Hulu! On this page you'll find a selection of 10 fantastic films that are all available to watch on the streamer this August. From recent hits like Steven Soderbergh's eerie ghost story Presence to all-time classics like Die Hard or the Back to the Future trilogy, these movies are sure to keep you excited and entertained.\nHulu holds its place in our list of the best streaming services thanks to its enviable selection of cinematic gems. There's a huge wealth of great titles to see here, and this list of 10 is really only scratching the surface of the streamer. Because of that we've also added a Pick of the Month to the list \u2013 for August 2025, we've chosen JJ Abrams 2011 sci-fi flick Super 8.\nSo, if you're looking for a great new movie to watch, check out our picks below. And when you're done, take a look at our lists of the 10 best Hulu shows and the best shows on Disney Plus.\nPick of the month\nSuper 8\nYear: 2011\nDirector: JJ Abrams\nJJ Abrams may be better known these days for his work in the Star Wars and Star Trek franchises, but this standalone sci-fi adventure is one of his best films. Originally released under a cloud of secrecy, Super 8 is a nostalgic homage to late '70s and early-'80s movies (especially Spielberg films) that feels a little like Stranger Things before Stranger Things.\nSet in 1979, Super 8 follows a gang of kids who are trying to make their own no-budget horror movie, filmed on a Super 8 camera. While filming, however, they stumble upon a mystery. They witness a train derailment and a group of soldiers arriving on the scene. And when they look back over their footage, they catch a glimpse of an unearthly creature... Fun, spooky, and full of charm, Super 8 is a modern classic streaming from August 1 on Hulu.\nHere's where you can keep track of the most exciting upcoming movies.\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nThe 10 best Hulu movies\n10. Presence\nYear: 2024\nDirector: Steven Soderbergh\nSteven Soderbergh's innovative supernatural thriller is coming to Hulu on June 3. A haunted house story with a difference, Presence is told entirely from the spirit's point of view. Taking place within a recently renovated house, the ghost observes a new family \u2013 Lucy Liu's Rebekah, Chris Sullivan's Chris, and their kids, Tyler (Eddy Maday), and Chloe (Callina Liang) \u2013 move in. When Tyler's new friend Ryan (West Mulholland) becomes a regular visitor, however, the \"presence\" starts to become more active...\nShot in secret during 2023, Presence offers a fresh take on one of the oldest storytelling traditions. Soderbergh puts us in the position of the spirit, silently watching a family that is slowly falling apart. Meditative and moving as well as occasionally genuinely eerie, this is a true one-off.\n9. Prey\nYear: 2022\nDirector: Dan Trachtenberg\nThere's a diabolical simplicity to the pitch behind Prey, the latest entry in the Predator franchise: What if a Predator hunted in a different period in history? Instead of having a Predator go up against the deadliest, Schwarzenegger-esque modern warrior with all the guns and ammo that entails, Prey is set in the Great Plains in the early 1700s. Amber Midthunder plays Naru, a Comanche woman whose desire to be a warrior instead of a healer, as her tribe would have her be, is tested to the extreme when an alien hunter searches for its quarry where the buffalo roam.\nPrey is a fun, refreshing change of pace for Predator, and it will have you wondering why there aren't more movies like this. Have a Predator fight samurai, or gladiators, or pirates, or have a Predator square off against a battalion of Allied forces in World War II. The possibilities that Prey unlocked should be endless.\nRead our Prey review for more insights ahead of Prey 2.\n8. BlackBerry\nYear: 2023\nDirector: Matt Johnson\nFor whatever reason, there was a glut of movies in 2023 that dramatized how certain products \u2014 like Air Jordans, Tetris, and Flamin' Hot Cheetos \u2014 were created. But, by far the best movie to emerge from this trend focuses on the rise and fall of the once-ubiquitous BlackBerry mobile phone that dominated the '00s until the iPhone ate its lunch.\nStarring Jay Baruchel and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia's Glenn Howerton as a geek and a ruthless businessman who forge a partnership as successful as it is tenuous, BlackBerry stands out from the crowd in its willingness to show the dark lows of capitalism in addition to its highs. It's a smart, insightful, and bleakly comedic look at tech and commerce.\nDive into one of the best drama movies around with our BlackBerry review.\n7. The Host\nYear: 2006\nDirector: Bong Joon-Ho\nParasite director Bong Joon-Ho made a creature feature in his own distinct way with 2006's The Host, which follows a Seoul family as they try to rescue a young family member who has been taken by a grotesque monster that emerged from the river and started wreaking havoc.\nAs with almost all of Director Bong's films, The Host blends comedy with darkness, dealing with some heavy themes involving class, bureaucracy, environmentalism, and more. The monster, some sort of mutated tadpole-like creature, is like nothing else you'll see on the screen, as is the unforgettable scene where it first comes ashore in broad daylight \u2014 totally throwing away the typical Jaws-style playbook of keeping the monster hidden. This is one of the best monster movies released in the 2000s and is well worth your time.\nFor more insights read our The Host review to find out more on this gem.\n6. Die Hard\nYear: 1988\nDirector: John McTiernan\nThe holiday season is coming up, and that's what we call a good bit of timing because Die Hard does indeed qualify as a Christmas movie. However, you can (and should) watch it at any time of year, regardless of your calendar, because it's an action masterpiece.\nBruce Willis stars as John McClane, a tired New York City cop who goes to LA to visit his estranged wife. Unfortunately, a group of robbers masquerading as terrorists led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) have taken everybody hostage, and only John McClane stands a chance at saving the day. Die Hard is a perfectly executed romp, and Willis makes for an all time action hero, in large part because he isn't like The Rock. He's just a regular guy \u2014 a very competent guy, granted, but an exasperated one.\nGet your blood pumping with our list of the best action movies on Netflix next.\n5. The Back to the Future trilogy\nYear: 1985\u20131990\nDirector: Robert Zemeckis\nGo back to the '80s with this iconic film trilogy. Michael J. Fox stars as Marty McFly, a teenager who meets Emmett Brown \"Doc\" Brown (Christopher Lloyd), a daffy scientist who has invented a time machine house in a DeLorean car. When Marty finds himself trapped in 1955 he has to ensure that his parents successfully meet or he will blink out of existence.\nThe first film is without doubt the best of then bunch \u2013 a timeless '80s classic that's as hilarious as it is exciting. The sequel leaps forward in time to the unimaginably futuristic world of 2015, and while it's less surefooted than the first film, it's just as much fun. That Part III jumps back 100 years to 1885 and straight into a Western is a little odd, but the film has more than enough charm to make it work. All three movies are streaming on Hulu and are great, family-friendly fun.\n4. Inception\nYear: 2010\nDirector: Christopher Nolan\nIs Inception Chris Nolan's finest film? As much as we love the Dark Knight trilogy, this cerebral sci-fi action flick remains a fantastic one-off. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a professional thief who uses technology to infiltrate the dreams of others and steal valuable information. His latest client is Ken Watanabe's businessman Saito, who hires Cobb to implant an idea in the mind of a competitor's playboy son: to dissolve his father's company.\nCue a surreal reverse heist as Cobb (who is grappling with a tragedy in his past) and his team tumble through different layers of dreams within dreams. It's heady stuff, but Nolan remembers to have fun, too. A snowbound assault on a mountain fortress is straight out of Bond, while Tom Hardy's Eames brings some welcome levity.\nWant an in-depth look at this flick? Read our Inception review.\n3. The Holdovers\nYear: 2023\nDirector: Alexander Payne\nOne of 2023's best films is often talked about as a Christmas movie, but we reckon it's a timeless classic whatever time of the year you see it. The Holdovers follows Paul Giamatti as Paul Hunham, an unpopular classics teacher at Barton Academy in New England who is forced to spend the festive season of 1970 with troubled Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), left behind on campus over the holidays, as well as Da'Vine Joy Randolph as grieving cafeteria manager Mary Lamb.\nThe Holdovers has a way of creeping up on you. At first it feels like a fussy comedy about two difficult, privileged people butting heads, while Lamb grows increasingly exasperated. As the trio get closer, however, the walls come down revealing the deep wounds these three people are carrying. Beautifully bittersweet, The Holdovers is a perfect evocation of the 1970s that packs a real emotional punch.\n2. Anora\nYear: 2024\nDirector: Sean Baker\nThe year's big winner at this year's Oscars was this heartbreaking, hilarious comedy-drama from director Sean Baker. Mikey Madison gives an outstanding performance as Ani, an American sex worker who ends up falling for Vanya (Mark Eydelshteyn), the playboy son of a Russian oligarch. The two marry and look set for a happy life together, but Vanya's parents are far from pleased with the arrangement...\nAnora starts out like a twisted fairytale, but quickly morphs into a tragic nightmare. Vanya's parents send a squad of goons to forcibly annul the marriage, leading to a stomach-knotting home invasion sequence and an unexpected tour of nocturnal New York. Despite all of this, it remains a genuinely funny film even as it arrives at its touching, painful, yet entirely believable conclusion.\nFind out what we made of this year's Best Picture winner in our full Anora review.\n1. Alien\nYear: 1979\nDirector: Ridley Scott\nA chest buster exploding out of Kane is one of the best and most gory scenes in film history, so it's only fitting that it's attached to one of the best horror movies ever made. When the seven-member crew of a commercial spaceship encounters a strange, parasitic alien killer, they're picked off one by one until only one of the great cinema heroines, Sigourney Weaver's Ellen Ripley, remains.\nRidley Scott's sci-fi horror masterpiece has spawned an entire franchise (the second installment, James Cameron's action flick Aliens, is also streaming on Hulu, and it\u2019s also a must-watch). Because of how successful Alien has become, it can be a bit easy to take the Xenomorph for granted. Try to forget everything you know about Alien before seeing the movie. It's best to try and be like the audiences in 1979 who had never seen, let alone imagined, a creature like the one H. R. Giger designed.\nIf you want more Xenomorphs in your life, you can read our guide on how to watch all the Alien movies in order.\nFor more streaming picks head over to your lists of the best movies on Disney Plus, the best movies on Amazon Prime and the best movies on Netflix.

Guy Ritchie recreates the world he established in his acclaimed 2019 film of the same name in this Netflix original with Divergent's Theo James at the helm alongside Maze Runner's Kaya Scodelario. In an unexpected turn of events, Edward inherits his father's 1500-acre estate and the title of Duke of Halstead instead of his elder brother, Freddie, and, in turn, his lucrative below-ground weed empire.\nNow a partner in big business to a crime leader's daughter, Susie Glass, Eddie has to navigate the underworld he's been plunged into and try and make it out alive, all while protecting his image as a gentleman. With a second season on the way, there\u2019s no better time to revisit this action comedy.\nRead our The Gentlemen review for more insights!\nNarcos\nYear: 2015\nSeasons: 3\nAvailable on: Netflix US/UK\nPrepare to sit at the edge of your seat, as you tune into the rise and fall of the infamous drug empire led by Pablo Escobar, leader of the Medell\u00edn Cartel.

Each one does something different without straying too far from its main theme of 'catch the bad guy.' It's a binge-worthy drama that will keep you on your toes.\nLove high-stakes? Check out our list of the best Netflix action movies streaming right now.\nCobra Kai\nYear: 2018\nSeasons: 6\nAvailable on: Netflix US/UK\nCalling all fans of The Karate Kid, the cherished sequel series Cobra Kai is all available to stream on Netflix. After its original release on YouTube Premium, the martial arts drama found a whole new audience when it joined the streaming platform for season three. Set three decades after the original films, the series picks up with Johnny Lawrence, who is suffering from alcoholism and depression after being defeated by his old nemesis, Daniel, as he tries to reform his ways and open the Cobra Kai dojo.\nThere are nods that Karate Kid fans will enjoy, including old cast members, as well as plenty of new material for anyone unfamiliar with the original. It's a story of contrast, resilience, and making peace with old feuds. The show ended in February, so all episodes are now available. Did someone say Cobra Kai marathon?\nRead our Cobra Kai season 6 ending explained to know how the story wrapped, and learn everything about the upcoming Karate Kid: Legends.\nBest Animated shows on Netflix\nArcane\nYear: 2021\nSeasons: 2\nAvailable on: Netflix US/UK\nSet in the Riot Games' League of Legends universe, Arcane is an action-adventure that follows sisters Vi and Jinx (voiced by Hailee Steinfeld and Ella Purnell) as they navigate the unrest between the contrasting worlds of the utopian city, Piltover and the seedy, oppressed side of Zaun. The animation has been widely praised for its world-building, action sequences, and storylines.\nInvested fans will love the homage to the original game, but this is still an accessible and exciting watch for anyone unfamiliar with the source material, too, which led to it becoming the first streaming series to win a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program. If you needed any more convincing, it's regarded as one of the best video game adaptations ever made, which is an accolade that shouldn't be taken lightly.\nTo keep up-to-date with this gem, head over to our Arcane season 2 release schedule guide. Or read our four-star Arcane season 2 review.\nCastlevania\nYear: 2017\nSeasons: 4\nAvailable on: Netflix US/UK\nBased on the acclaimed Japanese video game series of the same name, this dark action fantasy animation follows Trevor, the last surviving member of the disgraced Belmont clan, a formerly legendary family of monster hunters, as he sets out to take down the revered vampire Dracula and his expansive forces.\nAcross the four seasons there's a host of twists and turns, but also top-notch storytelling and animation throughout the 32 episodes. Starting with 20-minute episodes in the first season, it\u2019s an adaptation that is easy to binge and effortless in style. Castlevania is not one to miss. In fact, it's easily one of the best anime series on Netflix right now.\nLove, Death, and Robots\nYear: 2019\nSeasons: 4\nAvailable on: Netflix US/UK\nBrought to you by David Fincher and Joshua Donner, this unique animated series actually consists of a series of short films that aren't in any way interconnected. Set across various genres, the episodes sometimes relate to a similar theme, but feature different cast, crew, and stories.\nFincher and Donner originally planned this reboot of Heavy Metal to become a film, which is noticeable in the epic storytelling of each episode and makes for a rich feast for audiences across the four seasons. If you love robots, fantasy, romance, and science-fiction, then give this innovative world a whirl.\nVinland Saga\nYear: 2019\nSeasons: 2\nAvailable on: Netflix US/UK\nBased on Makoto Yukimura's manga of the same name, this Japanese anime series follows the life of Thorfinn, a man who is initially bloodthirsty for revenge after his father\u2019s death at the hands of Askeladd. He joins the formidable Vikings and sets out to unleash his rage on the world before ultimately losing all hope in the second season.\nThe acclaimed series has been praised for its animation, writing, and action sequences and the emotive exploration of Thorfinn's grief, psychological damage, and the trauma that haunts him, which develops the existing source material. Whether you're new to these stories or an avid manga reader, it's a breathtaking animation that deserves recognition.\nFor more 2D gems, you can head over to our guide on all the new anime heading our way.\nBest fantasy shows on Netflix\nThe Witcher\nYear: 2019\nSeasons: 3\nAvailable on: Netflix US/UK\nThe Witcher is the ultimate place to start if you're looking for high-fantasy escapism. Based on the novels by Andrzej Sapkowski, the series follows Geralt of Riviera as he goes across the Continent, slaying beasts and saving cities from destruction. Woven into this epic is the tale of crowned princess Ciri and the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg.\nThe success of the first three seasons has even led to a spin-off animated series and a live-action prequel, not to mention The Witcher season 4, which will see Liam Hemsworth take over from Henry Cavill in the titular role. It's an ever-expanding franchise, and for good reason: it's visually stunning, with intricate storylines woven across various timelines and bloody, brutal fight sequences. It's one of Netflix\u2019s greatest series.\nNeed more Geralt in your life? Read our list of the best games like The Witcher 3 to play today.\nShadow and Bone\nYear: 2021\nSeasons: 2\nAvailable on: Netflix US/UK\nIf you\u2019ve scrolled through Booktok, then you'll have heard of the Grishaverse, the fantasy universe where Shadow and Bone and the Six of Crows books are set. This adaptation of Leigh Bardugo's fantasy book follows Li, a young orphan who is the long-awaited Sun Summoner and has to step into her destiny and new identity as a Grisha, a person with magical abilities.\nThink The Witcher meets Harry Potter, if that's your vibe, then add this adaptation to your watch list. The second season covers more of this extensive universe, touching on epic storylines from several books in the series, including Siege and Storm and Crooked Kingdom. Ready to escape into an entirely new world? Look no further.\nRead our ranking of the best fantasy movies on Netflix for more epics.\nSweet Tooth\nYear: 2021\nSeasons: 3\nAvailable on: Netflix US/UK\nIn a post-apocalyptic world, Gus, a boy who is half-human and half-deer, sets out on an epic adventure to find his mother after the death of his father, with a gruff protector. Based on the comic book series, it's an eccentric, heart-warming, and whimsical tale that merges together the best of fantasy adventures and science fiction.\nGus is one of many hybrid animal-human babies who were born after a virus wiped out the majority of the world's population. If you needed any further convincing, the first two seasons received over twenty nominations for Children and Family Emmy awards, those accolades speak for themselves.\nFor more award winners, check out our list of the best shows on Apple TV to watch right now.\nOne Piece\nYear: 2023\nSeasons: 1\nAvailable on: Netflix US/UK\nThis beloved manga and one of the best anime series of all time moved into live-action in 2023, and it's safe to say it had big shoes to fill. Yet, the fantasy adaptation created by Matt Owens and Steven Maeda exceeded our expectations. It captured the heart of Eiichiro Oda's magnificent world, as the series followed Monkey D. Luffy (I\u00f1aki Godoy) and his crew of Straw Hat Pirates on the hunt for a fabled treasure.\nIt features an excellent cast with Emily Rudd as Nami, Mackenyu as Roronoa Zoro, and Taz Skylar as Sanji, who should be credited with bringing this well-loved story to life in a delightful new way for existing fans and new ones, too. With One Piece season 2 in the works, it's time to revisit this recent success.\nChilling Adventures of Sabrina\nYear: 2019\nSeasons: 2\nAvailable on: Netflix US/UK\nFar from the cozy, quaint comedy found in Sabrina the Teenage Witch, this Sabrina Spellman, taken from the Archie Comics, has a much darker edge. The series still follows Sabrina, a teen girl who struggles with her witch ancestry and longs to be normal, all while living with her two squabbling Aunts and her cat, Salem.\nThings generally turn from bad to worse for Sabrina as the series dabbles in everything dark, foul, and devilish in the witch world and its colossal repercussions. There's stand-out performances from Kiernan Shipka as Sabrina, as well as appearances from Doctor Who\u2019s Michelle Gomez, Lucy Davis, and Miranda Otto. There's only two seasons, told across four parts, but it's a spellbinding watch for anyone who loves witch lore, magic, and mayhem.\nRead our Chilling Adventures of Sabrina season 2 review for more witchy information.\nBest sci-fi shows on Netflix\nThe Eternaut\nYear: 2025\nSeasons: 1\nAvailable on: Netflix US/UK\nThis six-episode sci-fi thriller has proven to be one of the year's most unexpected and exciting sci-fi surprises. One night snow falls on Buenos Aires, killing everyone it touches. The show follow a group of everyday people, led by Ricardo Dar\u00edn's Juan Salvo, as they struggle to survive in what is eventually revealed to be the first stages of an alien invasion...\nBased on the famous Argentine comic series of the same name by H\u00e9ctor Germ\u00e1n Oesterheld and Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez, The Eternaut is immediately gripping from its surreal opening scene as a group of girls party on a boat only to see the lights of Buenos Aires go suddenly blink out. But despite its bleak subject matter, the show has a warmth and a pleasing sense of humor that keeps you rooting for the characters.\nBlack Mirror\nYear: 2011\nSeasons: 7\nAvailable on: Netflix US/UK\nYou can always rely on this dystopian anthology show, from British satirist Charlie Brooker, to put a menacing spin on the modern world. Every episode of Black Mirror is a standalone story and the show straddles many different genres, from action and horror to the sweet, gorgeous love story that is season 3's 'San Junipero.' What they all have in common, however, is that they will leave you questioning your relationship with technology.\nBlack Mirror season 7 has recently landed on Netflix, blessing us with six more episodes including stories about AI, sinister subscription services, and a long-awaited sequel to the fan favorite Star Trek parody 'USS Callister.' New seasons of Black Mirror are an irregular occurrence, so cherish this terrifying, thoughtful, and highly inventive series while you can.\nCheck out our handy guide to the best Black Mirror episodes.\nLost\nYear: 2010\nSeasons: 6\nAvailable on: Netflix US\nIt's easy to forget just how exciting, radical, and straight up game-changing Lost was at the start of the 2010s. Ostensibly a survival thriller about a group of people who survive a plane crash and wind up on a mysterious island, it grew over six seasons to incorporate everything from strange science experiments to a mythic battle between the forces of good and evil by way of time travel and polar bears. And that's not even scratching the surface of a show that rewards patience and fan loyalty like few others.\nFolk will tell you that Lost never explains its mysteries (it does) or that the ending is bad (it's not), but this really is a show where it's best to ditch any of your preconceived notions and discover the story for yourself. And no, they weren't dead all along.\nLost showrunner Damon Lindelof's next series was The Leftovers \u2013 hands down one of the best HBO Max shows.\nBodies\nYear: 2023\nSeasons: 1\nAvailable on: Netflix US/UK\nVenom's Stephen Graham fronts this British science fiction mystery thriller that sees the same dead body found in four locations in East London across four different time periods. The crime drama sees four police officers inspecting the same body, who become embroiled in a conspiracy far bigger than any of them could imagine.\nIt's a gripping twist on your standard murder mystery that will keep you guessing until the very end. Alongside Graham, the cast features Shira Haas, Jacob Fortune-Lloyd, Kyle Soller, and Amaka Okafor. With only eight episodes to get through, what are you waiting for?\nThe Umbrella Academy\nYear: 2019\nSeasons: 4\nAvailable on: Netflix US/UK\nOne of Netflix's best superhero series is The Umbrella Academy, which started with a strong first season and the second season even became the most-watched series on the platform in 2020. The series centers around a group of superhero siblings who are all miraculously born at the same time on the same day by women who were not actually pregnant.\nIt's stuffed with twists and each season seems to become even more energetic and ambitious than the last. If you're looking for a fresh spin on a comic book adaptation that features a standout cast, then The Umbrella Academy is for you.\nRead our The Umbrella Academy season 4 review for more information on the latest season.\nBest horror shows on Netflix\nMidnight Mass\nYear: 2021\nSeasons: 1\nAvailable on: Netflix US/UK\nAs we alluded to above, Mike Flanagan is the master of horror on Netflix. While The Haunting of Hill House is arguably his scariest series, Midnight Mass is both his most personal and his overall best. It's also a series that benefits from knowing as little as possible about before watching. All you need to know is that it follows Riley Flynn (Zach Gilford) as he returns to his home town, Crockett Island, having served time in jail for a drunk-driving incident where he killed a young woman. Also in town is Father Paul Hill (Hamish Linklater, in a role that brought him major acclaim), a priest who harbors dark secrets.\nThat's all we're gonna say, but trust us on this one. Midnight Mass takes tired genre tropes and breathes new life into them, ironically, by delivering a thoughtful, moving, and utterly chilling meditation on mortality and redemption.\nBack in 2021 we crowned Midnight Mass our TV show of the year. Find out why in our full Midnight Mass review \u2013 but watch out for spoilers.\nSquid Game\nYear: 2021\nSeasons: 3\nAvailable on: Netflix US/UK\nThe third and final season of this world-conquering thriller is streaming now, which means there's never been a better time to watch or rewatch the gruesome tale of Player 456. The first season fully lives up to hype as Lee Jung-jae's cash-strapped Gi-hun finds himself embroiled in a series of contests to win a huge cash prize. There's only one problem: these games are deadly. It's an old concept, but Squid Game's empathetic characters, terrifying set pieces, and a couple of smart twists make this a show for the ages.\nSeason 2 launched late last year and was less surefooted in its early episodes. By the time it had reached its almighty cliffhanger ending, however, the buzz was well and truly back. Season 3 has had its critics, but for our money it brings the show to a fitting conclusion \u2013 just in time for a much-anticipated US remake.\nFind out why we thought the new season was \"staggeringly excellent\" in our Squid Game season 3 review.\nThe Haunting of Hill House\nYear: 2018\nSeasons: 1\nAvailable on: Netflix US/UK\nChances are, if Mike Flanagan has written a horror series, it will be on our watch list. This adaptation of Shirley Jackson's terrifying novel lives up to its name. The Haunting of Hill House follows the Crain family, who move into the grand and remote 'Hill House' to flip it before moving on to their 'dream home.' But the house has other plans. Switching between the past and the present, the story picks up decades later as the now scattered family is reunited by the events of their childhood in that house.\nHill House is not for the faint-hearted. Both equal parts terrifying and mesmerizing. Its follow-up, The Haunting of Bly Manor, strikes a different tone but sees the return of the same actors in new roles, many of which are frequent collaborators with Flanagan, especially in his Netflix series. Final warning, though: you will be scared of turning the lights off at night after finishing this one.\nMore nightmares await in our list of the best Netflix horror movies.\nStranger Things\nYear: 2016\nSeasons: 4\nAvailable on: Netflix US/UK\nNow, there is nothing quite like Stranger Things. The Duffer Brothers' nostalgic coming-of-age series is rooted in the 1980s and references a host of iconic tropes in horror, science-fiction, and mystery. Set in a small town in Indiana, the first season begins with the disappearance of a young boy, Will Byers. As his mother, Joyce, the sheriff, and his friends start to investigate what happens, it seems that there\u2019s something much more sinister than any of them expected.\nA parallel world, packed with demonic monsters, sits right next to their own, and they have to venture into the Upside Down to set things straight again and save Will. With a phenomenal ensemble cast, it's one of the most outstanding series of the past decade. Make sure you catch up before Stranger Things season 5 is released.\nWednesday\nYear: 2022\nSeasons: 1\nAvailable on: Netflix US/UK\nTim Burton's coming-of-age horror-comedy is the most streamed series on Netflix for good reason. The Addams Family spin-off follows Jenna Ortega as a Wednesday Addams as she's enrolled in a centuries-old boarding school called Nevermore Academy. Unlike most teens her age, the gothic icon must learn to control her emerging psychic powers, stop a monster from destroying the town, and solve a murder that stems from generations of supernatural trauma from her family's history.\nAll the while, she reluctantly tries to find her place in the world outside of her mother's family. It swooped up awards of every kind and has been renewed - meaning that Wednesday season 2 will be released in 2025. This is a must-watch, and we aren't just saying that because we're excited by the recent casting news of Lady Gaga joining the next season either.\nFor more streaming picks, check out our lists of the best shows on HBO Max, the best shows on Disney Plus, and finally, the best Amazon Prime series.\nJess is a freelance culture and entertainment journalist based in Cambridgeshire who has bylines in Rolling Stone, GQ, Dazed, Cosmopolitan, Stylist, Radio Times, The Guardian and the i.

      "text": "The 25 best movies on Netflix to watch this week\nFrom Havoc to They Cloned Tyrone, here are 25 of the best Netflix movies to watch in August 2025\nIf you're looking for a list of the best Netflix movies to watch this week, then you've come to the right place. On this regularly-updated page, we've curated a list of 25 great films that are now available to watch on the streamer.\nNetflix is one of the best streaming services for movies. To help you navigate it, we've split the list into five genres. Kicking off with Action, we have tough and exciting movies like Rebel Ridge and Havoc. Next up is animation, with gems like Suzume and Grave of the Fireflies. Fantasy brings us some real big hitters like Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (which is leaving Netflix soon so watch it ASAP!), and is followed by some sci-fi classics like Godzilla Minus One and Okja. Finally, horror will leave you shuddering in terror with films like His House and Creep.\nBut first up is our pick of the week! So, if you're ready to find something great to watch, dive into our hit-packed list. And when you've finished reading this, check out our list of the 25 best Netflix shows, as well as our weekly guide to the best shows and movies.\nPick of the week\nThe Outrun\nYear: 2024\nDirector(s): Nora Fingscheidt\nAvailable on: US/UK\nOne of last year's finest films is now on Netflix in the US and the UK. The Outrun is a semi-fictionalised take on Amy Liptrott's memoir of the same name. It follows Rona (Saoirse Ronan), a character based on Liptrott, who is struggling with drug and alcohol abuse problems while living in London. To try and beat these, she moves back to Orkney, the isolated island she grew up on, reconnects with her parents and slowly starts to build a new life for herself.\nThe Outrun is an intensely emotional and beautifully played film. Ronan is sensational as Rona, a woman who has truly hit rock bottom, now given another shot at life. Orkney, meanwhile, looks stunning \u2013 wind-swept and rain-battered, but beautiful with it. A deeply-felt and sometimes painful film, The Outrun is ultimately life-affirming.\nAction\nBullet Train Explosion\nYear: 2025\nDirector(s): Shinji Higuchi\nAvailable on: US/UK\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nThis Japanese action thriller is a real nail-biter. It's a standalone sequel to director Junya Sato's 1975's classic The Bullet Train (sadly not currently available on Netflix), but don't worry if you've not seen that one, as Bullet Train Explosion has an irresistible premise that needs little explanation. Basically, an anonymous terrorist has planted a bomb on a high-speed train and if it drops beneath 100 km/h then it will explode.\nSounds a bit like Speed, huh? But as we say, The Bullet Train got there first. This new movie amps up the action, while maintaining the smarts. While an influencer on board complicates matters, the police and rail staff work together to try and find a way to get rid of the bomb before the train hits Tokyo Station. Gripping stuff.\nHavoc\nYear: 2025\nDirector(s): Gareth Evans\nAvailable on: US/UK\nThe Raid director Gareth Evans returns with this long-in-development Netflix Originals action movie starring Tom Hardy, Forest Whitaker, and Timothy Olyphant. Havoc was originally filmed in 2021, but has lingered in various stages of development hell for the last few years due to scheduling issues, reshoots, and strikes. Well, the film is finally complete and available for our viewing pleasure on Netflix this Friday \u2013 and the good news is that the early reviews for the film have been overwhelmingly positive.\nIn Havoc, Hardy plays Walker \u2013 a tough detective who must battle the criminal underworld in order to rescue a politician's son. Cue a ton of bullets, bloodshed, and hyper-kinetic violence. You can always rely on Hardy to bring the charisma and action is Evans speciality. If the reviews are anything to go by, then fans of The Raid's inventive violence will be more than satisfied by this brutal, unflinching neo-noir thriller.\nRebel Ridge\nYear: 2024\nDirector(s): Jeremy Saulnier\nAvailable on: US/UK\nWhen Terry (Aaron Pierre), a Marine Corps veteran, is harassed by the police and has the bail money he was saving for his cousin seized, he goes on a one-man mission to get justice. As the cops play dirty, Terry uses his very special skill set to exact his revenge and uncover corruption in small-town Louisiana.\nRebel Ridge wastes no time in creating a palpable tension, and writer-director Jeremy Saulnier ensures that the atmosphere is maintained for the full runtime. With a tight script, killer performance from Aaron Pierre, and scintillating set-pieces, this Netflix Original is not your typical action-thriller. In fact, it may also just be one of the best action movies ever made by a streaming service, so be sure to check it out.\nRRR\nYear: 2022\nDirector(s): S. S. Rajamouli\nAvailable on: US/UK\nThere's a reason RRR has been called one of the greatest action movies of all time. First released in cinemas, RRR has found a new life on Netflix, with Western audiences discovering this Indian epic. Directed by S. S. Rajamouli, the Telugu-language movie takes place in the 1920s and centers on two revolutionaries, Alluri Sitarama Raju (Ram Charan) and Komaram Bheem (N. T. Rama Rao Jr.), in their explosive challenge of the British Raj.\nIt's lengthy at 182 minutes, but RRR doesn't waste a second, cramming in everything from fiery bow and arrow battles and motorcycle chases to men fighting alongside bloodied tigers. If none of that tickles your fancy, firstly, what more do you want? Secondly, fear not, it also features a romantic subplot, a sweet bromance, and a couple of musical numbers, too. All of which culminates in making this one of the best Netflix movies you can watch right now.\nAnimation\nThe Mitchells vs the Machines\nYear: 2021\nDirector(s): Michael Rianda\nAvailable on: US/UK\nA family road trip goes terribly wrong when the titular family gets caught up in an AI uprising. Evil robots begin capturing humans with the intention of launching them into space as revenge for the treatment of the original PAL virtual assistant by tech entrepreneur Mark Bowman. But, in this disaster, the Mitchells learn to put aside their differences and realize just how much they care for one another, no matter how often they might argue.\nThe Mitchells vs the Machines is not only a vibrant and very funny animated movie; it\u2019s got a surprisingly emotional core to the story that\u2019ll make you want to hug your family straight after the credits roll. The voice cast does a phenomenal job of breathing life into the characters, and the animation style itself \u2014 the Lord and Miller involvement is clear to see \u2014 is delightfully playful.\nFancy more animation in your life? Jump into our The Mitchells vs the Machines review for more colorful fun.\nGrave of the Fireflies\nYear: 1988\nDirector(s): Isao Takahata\nAvailable on: US/UK\nAre you ready to experience some of the best anime on Netflix? Well, then, this entry will be right up your street. In Japan, devastated by World War 2, two orphaned siblings, Seita and his sister Setsuko, traverse the land looking for a means to survive. As supplies dwindle and their health deteriorates, the young pair can only find comfort in one another amid the spiritual journey they undertake.\nGrave of the Fireflies is one of those rare but beautiful films that you might only watch once; such is the emotional toll it carries. As with all Studio Ghibli movies, this is a true work of art visually, with some of the most gorgeous yet heartbreaking frames you're likely to find in animation. Just don't go into this expecting the cute, playful side of Ghibli, because you will find yourself broken by the end of the story.\nFor more on the masterpiece, read our five-star Grave Of The Fireflies review.\nWallace and Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl\nYear: 2024\nDirector(s): Nick Park and Merlin Crossingham\nAvailable on: US/UK\nThe beloved animated Claymation duo are back. Wallace & Gromit: Vengeance Most Fowl is now available on Netflix. This is their sixth film outing on screen and second feature-length film, and has already been lauded as one of their best.\nThe premise sees Feathers McGraw return from The Wrong Trousers with revenge on his mind. His approach? Using Wallace's new robotic garden gnome invention against them. Reviews are really strong for the animated outing, which even landed Aardman an Oscar nomination as well.\nSuzume\nYear: 2022\nDirector(s): Makoto Shinkai\nAvailable on: US/UK\nPart-romantic time travel, part-fantasy disaster movie, Suzume follows the eponymous teenager as she explores a mystical multiverse via magical doors that act as portals to other sections of her timeline and beyond. She teams up with Souta, a mysterious man charged with closing these portals and preventing another supernatural catastrophe that would destroy Tokyo. What follows is a story that confronts loneliness, gives us romance, and takes us on an unforgettable adventure that may very well bring you to tears as well.\nSuzume is, quite simply, one of the most astounding animated movies of the 2020s. Not only does it perfectly blend a multitude of different genres, it does it all while looking absolutely incredible. The story is so rich and full of heart, and the whole thing is epic in scale while retaining the essence of a human drama.\nCheck out our Suzume review for more on this anime movie.\nLost in Starlight\nYear: 2025\nDirector(s): Han Ji-won\nAvailable on: US/UK\nParasite director Bong Joon Ho described this movie as a \"visual masterpiece\", and it's easy to see why. A beautiful new anime movie that feels like the spiritual successor to Your Name, Lost in Starlight is one of those gems that too often goes unnoticed on Netflix, and it shouldn't.\nThis Korean sci-fi romance film, now available to stream on Netflix, is set in Seoul in 2050, and follows astronaut Nan-young (Kim Tae-ri) as she falls in love with a musician named Jay (Hong Kyung). As Nan-young's new space mission takes her to Mars, the lovebirds have to deal with their separation, while the perils of deep space become an obstacle for Nan-young's return to Earth.\nFantasy\nDungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves\nYear: 2023\nDirector(s): John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein\nAvailable on: US\nDungeons & Dragons may be a name synonymous with fantasy adventuring, but it's never really made for a decent movie until this charming adventure came along. Honor Among Thieves takes the essentials of D&D \u2013 magical worlds, a group of diverse characters, and monsters \u2013 and handles them with wit and care. It's an unexpectedly funny film, but never feels like it's making fun of the source material or its fans.\nChris Pine plays the shifty bard Edgin Darvis, while Michelle Rodriguez is the barbarian Holga. The pair lead a typical D&D party (which also includes Justice Smith's sorceror Simon, and Sophia Lillis as the tiefling druid Doric) on a quest to steal the treasure of Hugh Grant's Lord Forge Fitzwilliam, who has illegally seized control of the city of Neverwinter. It's a lighthearted movie, but there's a nice core of emotion too, and it's accessible to anyone, even if you've never rolled a D20 before.\nNimona\nYear: 2023\nDirector(s): Troy Quane, Nick Bruno\nAvailable on: US/UK\nOne of the newer entries on our list, Nimona, is a 2023 gem that people don't put in the spotlight enough. Well, we're here to change that; this Netflix movie is wholly worth your time and attention. Wrongfully accused of killing Queen Valerin, Ballister Boldheart becomes a fugitive and must gather evidence to prove his innocence, win back the trust of his boyfriend, Ambrosius Goldenloin, and unite the kingdom. And, like it or not, he\u2019s going to have the help of the titular monster, who has mischievous yet rather powerful abilities.\nIt's hard to put a finger on exactly what it is, but Nimona just feels different to most of the movies being produced lately, and that\u2019s a very good thing. Vibrant animation, a smart and stirring story, and magnificent worldbuilding combine to make Nimona one of the most dynamic and intriguing fantasy movies on Netflix. It's also a great pick to watch with the whole family, so if you are looking for the best Netflix movies for kids come your movie night, this one is for you.\nTroll\nYear: 2022\nDirector(s): Roar Uthaug\nAvailable on: US/UK\nNorwegian monster movie Troll became a surprise hit when it was first released in 2022, creeping up to become one of Netflix's most-watched movies ever. Helmed by Tomb Raider director Roar Uthaug, it follows an unlikely group who are pulled together to stop an ancient troll who has awakened in a Norwegian mountain.\nWith a rich mythology behind it, as well as exciting action sequences and strong performances, Troll is well worth adding to your watchlist. And good news if you like it too, as a sequel is already in development.\nThe Old Guard\nYear: 2020\nDirector(s): Gina Prince-Bythewood\nAvailable on: US/UK\nBased on the comic book of the same name, The Old Guard is a fresh take on the superhero subgenre, which sees a band of warriors with regenerative healing abilities working as mercenaries. While they take on jobs to help people, unfortunately, their latest mission will set them on a path to deception, experimentation, and great conflict.\nThe Old Guard is another hit from one of the most exciting action directors working today, Gina Prince-Bythewood. Once again, the set pieces in this film are out of this world, with jaw-dropping hand-to-hand combat that would make John Wick proud. Charlize Theron is always of great value, too, and she puts her heart and soul into making Andy an exceptionally cool, captivating lead character. It isn't a perfect film by any means, but it is a wildly entertaining one to add to your Netflix watchlist.\nWant to see Charlize Theron in action? Read our The Old Guard review.\nGuillermo del Toro's Pinocchio\nYear: 2022\nDirector(s): Guillermo del Toro\nAvailable on: US/UK\nWe all know the story of Pinocchio, the wooden toy who longed to be a real boy, but Guillermo del Toro's take embraces the darker elements of the story (obviously). Set against the backdrop of fascist Italy, drawing on themes of depression and grief, and utilizing mind-boggling stop-motion animation techniques, this version of Pinocchio is far from the Disney classic.\nBut, that's a good thing. Del Toro has never been afraid to share his passion for the power of animation, and this is the perfect showcase of just how diverse and potent the medium can be. Not only does GDT's Pinocchio look fantastic, but it's also incredibly mature and impactful, while retaining some of the more fun and fantastical elements of the original story. It's hard to top one of the best Disney movies of all time. However, this Netflix fantasy manages to exceed our expectations with each watch-through.\nSci-fi\nLeave the World Behind\nYear: 2023\nDirector(s): Sam Esmail\nAvailable on: US/UK\nThis apocalyptic thriller from Mr. Robot creator Sam Esmail (based on Rumaan Alam's novel) shows the end of civilization happening in terrifying slow motion. Julia Roberts and Ethan Hawke are Amanda and Clay, a wealthy couple who are disturbed when their holiday rental vacation is interrupted first by a crashing cargo ship, then by the arrival of Mahershala Ali's GH and his daughter Ruth (Myha\u2019la Herrold). Distrust grows between the families, but soon they are forced to reckon with much bigger problems...\nBoth a psychological thriller and a bleak piece of very near future sci-fi, Leave the World Behind is worryingly plausible in its depiction of how a chain of seemingly disparate events can lead to disaster. Fun fact: The film was executive produced by former U.S. President Barack and First Lady Michelle Obama, with the former giving Sam Esmail notes on the story while the film was in development.\nCheck out our full review of Leave the World Behind from 2023.\nOkja\nYear: 2017\nDirector(s): Bong Joon-ho\nAvailable on: US/UK\nWhen you go into a Bong Joon-ho picture, you know you're probably going to get dark humor, bloody violence, and some mega twists and turns along the way. Okja is a little different, though. This is a story about Mija, who has a special bond with her pet super pig, Okja, an animal specially bred using genetic mutations with the intention of ending world hunger. The problem is, that Mija doesn't want her beloved companion to become somebody\u2019s next meal.\nFirst of all, Okja is precious, and she should be protected at all costs (think sci-fi Moo Deng). But cute, super pig aside, this is by far Bong\u2019s most tender tale to date, and if you don't shed even a little tear watching this, you're a monster. Come for the cute pig, stay for Jake Gyllenhaal's wacky turn as the eccentric zoologist, Dr. Johnny Wilcox. Trust us, this is easily one of the best sci-fi movies on Netflix right now.\nGodzilla Minus One\nYear: 2023\nDirector(s): Takashi Yamazaki\nAvailable on: US/UK\nThis fresh take on the Godzilla story (aka one of the best monster movies ever made) sends us to war-torn Japan as the country reels from the fallout of World War 2, but the people of Tokyo are about to face a new level of destruction in the form of the titular kaiju. It is up to pilot K\u014dichi Shikishima to lead the charge against the monster, while he grapples with survivor's guilt and a difficult romantic arrangement.\nGodzilla Minus One somehow manages to feel huge in scale, while managing to capture the most intricate, nuanced, and meaningful aspects of the human experience within a frenetic disaster movie. It looks phenomenal, especially the all-important design of the iconic monster; the musical score is off the Richter scale, and it's paced with precision to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout.\nTake a bite out of our Godzilla Minus One review for more on this monster movie.\nThey Cloned Tyrone\nYear: 2023\nDirector(s): Juel Taylor\nAvailable on: US/UK\nOne night, Fontaine (John Boyega) is shot dead in a drug-related gang conflict. The next day, he's seemingly back from the dead, with no memory of the previous night. Together with one of his customers, Slick, (Jamie Foxx), and Yo-Yo (Teyonah Parris), a sex worker-client of Slick\u2019s, Fontaine begins to uncover a conspiracy that will change his life forever.\nThey Cloned Tyrone brings out the best of all three of its lead actors, with Foxx delivering one of his funniest performances to date, Boyega going back to Attack the Block vibes, and Parris proving she is far more interesting in quirky genre movies than she is as a superhero. This Netflix Original feels like a modern tale from The Twilight Zone. It's Lovecraftian, almost, but with far more humor. They Cloned Tyrone is one of the most creative pickings that Netflix has to offer at the moment, so it's a must-watch!\nDive into our They Cloned Tyrone review for more details.\nSpaceman\nYear: 2024\nDirector(s): Johan Renck\nAvailable on: US/UK\nOK, fair warning before you even consider watching this entry: if you're afraid of spiders (even if they are from space and voiced by Paul Dano), this isn\u2019t a film for you. If you can stomach friendly arachnids, though, you're in for a treat because Spaceman is one of the best Netflix originals to come out of 2024. Based on the novel Spaceman of Bohemia by Jaroslav Kalfa\u0159, the movie gives us a sci-fi romp laced with highly relatable themes around loneliness and human relationships.\nThe plot follows the Czech cosmonaut Jakub Proch\u00e1zka (played by Adam Sandler), who is six months into a mission to investigate a mysterious cloud on Jupiter called Chopra. However, when he starts missing his family and his marriage becomes strained, his sci-fi tasks become tangled with his own internal issues. Spaceman's plot isn't perfect but it's heartfelt and very much worthy of your time this month.\nCheck out our Spaceman review for more information.\nHorror\nUs\nYear: 2019\nDirector(s): Jordan Peele\nAvailable on: US/UK\nNetflix has added this gem from Jordan Peele, which will blow your mind and leave you with many questions. Starring Lupita Nyong'o, Us is a twisty and unexpected story of appropriation, privilege, buried traumas and the duality of human nature, which made for a fantastic follow-up to Get Out.\nThe film follows Adelaide Wilson as she travels with her family to the beachfront home where she grew up, and where she had a traumatic experience. Soon, the past comes back to haunt her in the shape of weird beings that look exactly like them. Wearing red jumpsuits and wielding golden scissors, the strangers wreak havoc in the area, and force Adelaide to confront a dark truth.\nIf you still have questions after watching it, check out our Us ending explained for some of the answers.\nCreep\nYear: 2014\nDirector(s): Patrick Brice\nAvailable on: US/UK\nPatrick Brice's low budget found footage thriller remains one of the best examples of the subgenre \u2013 a tense, funny, and deeply unsettling character study. Broke filmmaker Aaron (Patrick Brice) accepts an unusual gig: shooting a video diary for Josef (Mark Duplass) \u2013 a terminally ill man who initially says that he wants to leave a record of his life for his unborn son. Aaron starts to suspect that Josef may not be being entirely honest with him, but he doesn't realise quite how dangerous his new \"friend\" really is...\nIn \"Josef\" \u2013 it's never clear if that really is his name, or just another lie \u2013 Duplass embodies one of the great horror villains of recent years. It's an incredible, unpredictable performance that oscillates between all-consuming loneliness, jovial good humor, and barely-controlled psychosis. The sequel, Creep 2, is also worth a look and available on Netflix.\nUnder the Shadow\nYear: 2016\nDirector(s): Babak Anvari\nAvailable on: US/UK\nIf one parent-child traumatic horror movie wasn't enough for you, we've got another recommendation here, and this time, it comes all the way from Iran, as acclaimed filmmaker Babak Anvari takes us back to '80s war-torn Tehran. There, medical student Shideh and her daughter Dorsa are plagued by an unwelcome and unsettling presence in their home.\nCombining the terrors of war in the Middle East with a supernatural possession story is harrowing but a masterful move by Anvari. The technical elements of this unsettling horror are of the highest order, but it is in the sound design that Under the Shadow flourishes. At less than 90 minutes, there's no excuse not to give this one a go\u2026 unless you're scared, that is?\nCalibre\nYear: 2018\nDirector(s): Matt Palmer\nAvailable on: UK/US\nStraddling the line between horror and psychological thriller, Calibre stars Slow Horse actor Jack Lowden as Vaughn. He joins his friend Marcus (Martin McCann) on a weekend hunting trip to the Scottish Highlands. However, the pair soon find themselves caught up in a traumatic event.\nNo spoilers here, but it's a gut-wrenching premise. The movie is rated with a perfect score on Rotten Tomatoes with many praising it for its tense atmosphere and impressive performances.\nHis House\nYear: 2020\nDirector(s): Remi Weekes\nAvailable on: US/UK\nHorror movies are brilliant vehicles for tackling some of society\u2019s biggest talking points, and His House wonderfully and creepily hones in on the experiences of refugees in Britain and the way they are treated by the communities they enter. Bol and Rial flee war-torn South Sudan to take asylum in a dingy London flat, but while this new home should be a safe haven, it becomes a terrifying symbol of everything they have left behind.\nAs far as directorial debuts go, His House is certainly one of the most assured and unique of the 2020s. Remi Weekes imbues his film with the promise of life and the threat of death at every turn, creating a surrealist atmosphere that really will get under your skin. Stars Wunmi Mosaku and Sope Dirisu are fascinating to watch and are frighteningly convincing, too.\nFor more streaming picks, you can read our lists of the best movies on Amazon Prime, the best movies on Disney Plus right now, and the very best HBO Max movies streaming.\nJakob is a freelance journalist with a decade\u2019s worth of experience in the entertainment sector.

      "text": "The 25 best shows on Amazon Prime Video to watch in August 2025\nOur pick of the best shows on Amazon Prime Video to stream this August\nOur list of the best shows on Amazon Prime Video is a diverse selection with something for everyone. From action-packed shows like The Boys to mind-blowing gems like Undone, these are some of the most exciting TV series available right now.\nAmazon Prime Video is easily one of the best streaming services out there. To help you navigate it, we've picked out a selection of 25 fantastic shows and divided them up by genre: action, animation, fantasy, sci-fi, and horror. We've also chosen a pick of the month \u2013 this time around it's The Terminal List: Dark Wolf, a prequel show that reunites Chris Pratt and Taylor Kitsch for more military action and espionage.\nWhen you've finished here, check out our list of the best Amazon Prime movies, or our lists of the best shows on Netflix and the best shows on Apple TV Plus.\nPick of the month\nThe Terminal List: Dark Wolf\nYear: 2025\nSeasons: 1\nThe Terminal List was a hit for Amazon Prime Video back in 2022 \u2013 not surprising given the caliber of its cast, which included the likes of Guardians of the Galaxy star Chris Pratt and Taylor Kitsch. There's a sequel series currently in development, but before that we have The Terminal List: Dark Wolf \u2013 a new prequel series that explores the back story of Navy SEAL Ben Edwards (Kitsch) in the run up to the first season. Pratt is also back, reprising his role as Lieutenant Commander James Reece.\nThe original Terminal List was a tough and exciting military action adventure. This gripping prequel sounds like it will enhance our understanding of that first run while setting the stage for future missions.\nThe first three episodes of The Terminal List: Dark Wolf land on Amazon Prime Video on August 27, with the remaining four parts following weekly from then.\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nBest action shows on Amazon Prime\nThe Boys\nYear: 2019 - Ongoing\nSeasons: 4\nWhere do we start with The Boys? This show from Eric Kripke gave the superhero genre a joyously filthy and bloody kick up the butt. It's set in a world where superheroes are morally compromised figures, with their acts of heroism controlled by the whims of Vought \u2013 a company motivated by profit. The show follows a group of vigilantes trying to expose the \"heroes\" for what they really are.\nThis isn't a show for the faint-hearted, with genuinely shocking bloodshed and just about every other type of content you would want to be warned about in advance. But it's a viciously funny show, helped along by exceptional performances, including Antony Starr's truly chilling turn as Homelander. One thing's for certain. If you watch The Boys, you\u2019ll never forget it. The Boys season 5 is also on its way, so now is a perfect time to dive in.\nFor more insights into this must-watch Prime series, read our The Boys season 4 review!\nReacher\nYear: 2022 - Ongoing\nSeasons: 3\nLook, Tom Cruise just didn't cut it. As much fun as we had with Cruise's two movies as the US army man turned drifter and problem solver, his physical presence just didn't match the formidable fighter from prolific author Lee Child's series of books. Step forward, Alan Ritchson and his gargantuan arms.\nIn an era of tangled franchise storytelling and complex supernatural lore, there's a joy to a show that just focuses on a big dude beating the crap out of bad guys. Sometimes, simple is best. There's a third season of Reacher in the can for release next year, with a fourth already commissioned. It looks like Alan Ritchson won't be able to cancel his gym membership just yet, and it\u2019s us who will benefit from that.\nThe new season is currently streaming on Prime right now! For more information, see what happened in the Reacher season 3 ending!\nHunters\nYear: 2020 - 2023\nSeasons: 2\nAl Pacino has had starring roles in exactly two TV shows: Angels in America, a 2003 miniseries centered around a gay man who's visited by an angel, and this, about a bunch of Nazi hunters in the '70s. He's an actor of contrast and variety, that's for sure.\nPacino commands the titular Hunters over two seasons as Meyer Offerman, a holocaust survivor. When group find out about plans for a fascist resurgence in the US, they engage in swift, violent recourse and subterfuge, delving into the American government's relocation efforts for Nazi scientists. It's not exactly cheerful, but David Weil's show is more relevant and prescient than any of us would like.\nTom Clancy's Jack Ryan\nYear: 2018 - 2023\nSeasons: 4\nJohn Krasinski isn't perhaps the most obvious action hero, but that didn\u2019t stop him making four seasons worth of this show about a CIA analyst pulled into the dangers of the field. He's walking in the footsteps of some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest names, with Ryan previously played on the big screen by Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford, Ben Affleck, and Chris Pine. That's a hell of a roster.\nThe series took this version of Ryan into a selection of high-stakes environments, with the various seasons taking on the likes of Islamic extremism, political corruption in South America, and an attempt at bringing about nuclear warfare. This version of Ryan is portrayed as an everyman hero in the Bruce Willis mold, which suits Krasinski's style perfectly.\nIf you are after more top-quality thrills, read our list of the best action movies of all time.\nCitadel\nYear: 2023 - Ongoing\nSeasons: 1\nAmazon Prime has a lengthy track record for making some of the most expensive shows of all time. Citadel \u2013 executive produced by Avengers: Endgame directors the Russo Brothers \u2013 slots into that arena. It\u2019s a glossy, high-stakes spy thriller in which Richard Madden plays a former spy who is living a new, quiet life after his memory was wiped. Naturally, he gets drawn back into the world of espionage.\nIt\u2019s certainly true that Citadel doesn't break much in the way of new ground in the world of spy stories. There\u2019s a shadowy organization involved, of course, and some MacGuffin-like data that everyone wants, as well as a tale of shifting loyalties. Don't expect to get an intellectual workout from Citadel, but do expect a fun spectacle and plenty of attractive people running around in beautiful clothes. Sometimes, that's all you want from a big-budget thriller. There's a second season on the way, so there's no end in sight to the opulence.\nFor more information, read our Citadel review.\nBest animated shows on Amazon Prime\nSecret Level\nYear: 2024\nSeasons: 1\nSecret Level is a dream come true for video game fans, so of course, it has to be on our list. The Prime Video animated anthology series is made of 15 episodes, each of them inspired by a different game, from classics like Pac-Man and Warhammer 40,000 to more recent titles like Honor of Kings.\nThe show was created by Deadpool director and Netflix's Love, Death & Robots creator Tim Miller, and it features an all-star voice cast including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kevin Hart, and Keanu Reeves. As often happens with anthologies, some episodes are better than others, which makes for an uneven (but always fascinating) watch. If you only have time for a couple of them, we recommend The Armored Core and the Pac-Man episodes, which are absolutely wild.\nFor more information, check out our review of Secret Level.\nUndone\nYear: 2019 - 2022\nSeasons: 2\nUndone hails from Bojack Horseman creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg, but citing that series in comparison does a disservice to the originality of this comedy-drama. The story follows Alma (Rosa Salazar) who can't find her place in the world. Drifting along as her younger sister is on the cusp of marriage, she finds herself thrown into an unexpected predicament following a car crash: she can jump through time. Her new gift allows her to commune with her deceased father, who requires her help in unraveling a mystery.\nUndone is unlike anything else on television right now. Lifting themes from Lynch, such as trauma, and spinning them into a more coherent tale, the show also boasts ambitious animation work called rotoscoping. This technique involves artists and animators \"drawing over\" live-action footage. Not only does it lend Undone a dreamy visual, but it also meshes the story with the style as Alma's dips into different realities are beautifully rendered.\nThe Legend of Vox Machina\nYear: 2022 - Ongoing\nSeasons: 3\nCritical Role is the definition of a cult hit \u2013 a web series in which voice actors play Dungeons and Dragons with each other. The series became such a success that their first campaign turned into the source material for this animated show, which was largely funded by a Kickstarter pot for its first season. That shows just how much of a following Critical Role was able to bring to the table.\nThe Legend of Vox Machina now spans three seasons, taking the best of the chaotic original campaign while streamlining and focusing the narrative to work as a more traditional TV series. For nerds like us and fans of the RPG world, it\u2019s an absolute treat.\nIf you love D&D and fantasy games, read our list of the best RPGs to play today.\nSausage Party: Foodtopia\nYear: 2024 - Ongoing\nSeasons: 1\nI'm still not sure I've quite recovered from seeing the completely outrageous Sausage Party on the big screen in 2016. The next step for Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg? Bring that food-based anarchy to the small screen and see what sort of culinary depravity they can get away with.\nFoodtopia follows the aftermath of the film, which triggers an uprising in which food destroys humanity and becomes the dominant force on Earth. It might lack the shock factor that made the movie so remarkable, but Foodtopia shows there's plenty of juice left in the concept. There's a second season on the way, so get ready for the filthiest food puns and inappropriate visual comedy you can possibly imagine. Seriously, this makes the famously questionable anime Food Wars (aka one of the best anime series on Netflix) look tame. Keep your kids away.\nBatman: Caped Crusader\nYear: 2024 - Ongoing\nSeasons: 1\nCan the world handle yet another version of Batman? Well, it turns out that it can (and we aren't just saying that because we regularly rewatch all the best Batman movies). Thanks to Bruce Timm, who previously worked on the classic 1990s show Batman: The Animated Series, we now have this film noir-inspired take on the character. It follows a young version of Bruce Wayne, voiced by Hamish Linklater, as he gets to grips with his crime-fighting career in the corrupt Gotham City.\nIt\u2019s a more mature and murky take on the character than we\u2019ve seen in some versions, focusing on the psychological storytelling over the spectacle of big-screen Batman outings. If that sounds like every other recent Batman \u2013 and it might \u2013 the innovation of the noir setting helps to offset that, embracing the character\u2019s occasional moniker as the \u201cworld\u2019s greatest detective.\u201d\nCheck out our Batman: Caped Crusader review for more information.\nBest fantasy shows on Amazon Prime\nLord of the Rings: The Rings of Power\nYear: 2022 - Ongoing\nSeasons: 2\nAmazon Prime doesn't make its TV shows quietly. Certainly, it threw a bounty the size of Smaug's hoard at the team behind this prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Starring the terrific Morfydd Clark as a younger version of elven warrior Galadriel, it deals with the birth of the rings of power and the return of the evil Sauron.\nThe joy, though, of this series is in the way it expands Middle-earth and introduces us to whole new worlds and environments. The island kingdom of N\u00famenor, in particular, is truly stunning. If you can keep up with the dozens of characters and myriad storylines, this is epic fantasy storytelling at its most epic and fantastical. The Rings of Power season 3 is also on its way, so it's a good idea to catch up now ahead of our return to Middle-earth.\nIf you want a deeper Tolkien dive, read our The Rings of Power season 2 review.\nThe Wheel of Time\nYear: 2021 - Ongoing\nSeasons: 2\nOnly the most hardcore fantasy fans will have made it through The Wheel of Time series in book form. Written by Robert Jordan, with the last three volumes completed by Brandon Sanderson after Jordan's death, the series spans more than 11,000 pages. That has given Amazon Prime plenty of material for this TV adaptation.\nRosamund Pike plays Moiraine Damodred, who is part of an order of powerful women looking for a mighty being known as the Dragon Reborn. That being is destined to save the world from a hideous evil. Obviously, there's a lot more to the plot than that, but the best way to experience it is to dive in and explore the richness of one of TV's boldest and most expansive fantasy worlds. Season 3 is now available to watch on Prime Video.\nFor more insights into this epic show, check out our The Wheel of Time season 2 review.\nGood Omens\nYear: 2019 - Ongoing\nSeasons: 2\nIt\u2019s always a good idea to cast Michael Sheen and David Tennant to play alongside each other. It\u2019s even better when you can cast them as an angel and demon, respectively. That\u2019s the central premise of Good Omens, which follows these unlikely supernatural pals as they team up to prevent the rise of the Antichrist. The second season introduced Jon Hamm as the Archangel Gabriel.\nReally, this series is all about the chemistry between these two leads. It\u2019s worth watching just to see two tremendous actors at the height of their powers, both in real life and in the fantasy world. A planned third season of the show paused production in September 2024, with a 90-minute special instead set to wrap up the story.\nIf you want more magical streaming recommendations, head over to our list of the best fantasy movies on Netflix.\nMy Lady Jane\nYear: 2024\nSeasons: 1\nJudged by the name alone, My Lady Jane feels like the sort of thing we've seen before. It's a period drama based on the life of the Tudor figure Lady Jane Grey. However, this adaptation of a book by Brodi Ashton, Cynthia Hand, and Jodi Meadows imagines an alternate history in which Lady Jane existed in a world also populated by humans who can transform into animals who have been driven out of society by the rest of the human race.\nThe word \"romp\" was invented for a show like this, which is just an absolute ton of fun from start to finish. Unfortunately, Amazon canceled it after just one season. However, there has been a huge campaign to revive it, which even George RR Martin supported, so we might not have heard the last of My Lady Jane. We can only hope.\nBest sci-fi shows on Amazon Prime\nThe Peripheral\nYear: 2022\nSeasons: 1\nThe Peripheral is just one of the 2022 series that is impossible not to shout out whenever you get the chance. The sci-fi thriller came from the minds of Westworld creators Christopher Nolan and Lisa Joy and is still a marvel today.\nBased on the 2014 novel of the same name by William Gibson, it centers on Flynne Fisher (played by Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz), who finds a connection to an alternate reality. However, what initially seems like an exciting new adventure also contains a dark secret about her own future. Critics called it \"propulsive, imaginative, and visually dazzling.\" It's a fascinating series, has great performances, and shows us once again that sci-fi makes for great streaming content.\nFallout\nYear: 2024 - Ongoing\nSeasons: 1\nFor more than a decade, Hollywood had tried to get an adaptation of the Fallout video game franchise off the ground. Thanks to Graham Wagner and Geneva Robertson-Dworet\u2019s TV series, it has finally made it. The show takes place 200 years after the planet has been devastated by nuclear war, with most survivors living in vaults. Ella Purnell plays one such survivor who ventures to the surface to search for her father, played by Kyle MacLachlan.\nThat\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg, though, for an ensemble show that also includes Walton Goggins as a mutated bounty hunter known as The Ghoul. At a time when video game adaptations can go either way \u2013 The Last of Us is one of the best HBO Max shows in years, while the Borderlands movie was a stinker \u2013 Fallout stands head and shoulders above most of the competition. It\u2019s no surprise that Fallout season 2 is on its way.\nRead our Fallout season 1 review if you want to know more about this gem.\nThe Expanse\nYear: 2015 - 2022\nSeasons: 6\nIn the future, according to Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby\u2019s series The Expanse and the novels on which it is based, humanity will have colonized the rest of the solar system. It\u2019s a complex satire of power and capitalism, focusing on the tension and fragile peace across the system as a result of geopolitical turmoil and the potential for resources in these new worlds.\nThe Expanse isn\u2019t for everyone. It\u2019s very dense and complex in terms of both plot and characters. But for those who eat up this sort of high sci-fi \u2013 think Foundation and For All Mankind (aka two of the best shows on Apple TV)\u2013 The Expanse is a great addition to that genre. And with 62 episodes to get through, it will keep you going for at least a few weeks.\nUpload\nYear: 2020 - Ongoing\nSeasons: 3\nSci-fi is often a bit miserable, so it's refreshing to see a show like Upload \u2013 put together by The US Office creator Greg Daniels \u2013 embrace the comedy that exists within a premise like this. The show takes place around a decade in the future in a world where recently deceased people can be \"uploaded\" to an afterlife of their choosing, such as the super-posh Lakeview. Robbie Amell plays a prematurely killed man who may well have actually been murdered.\nYes, this is a Black Mirror-esque setup. But there's a wit and a charm to the piece that makes it work, even as the plot complexity ramps up. If you want your sci-fi to feel human above all else, then Upload is a great choice. There's a fourth season on the way, which will wrap up the overarching story.\nFor more space stories, check out our list of the best sci-fi movies of all time.\nTales from the Loop\nYear: 2020\nSeasons: 1\nA local town of people in Ohio lives above \"The Loop,\" a machine built to unlock and explore the mysteries of the universe. The Loop makes the impossible possible, and each episode looks at the life of one of those it affects.\nInspired by the famed paintings of Simon Stalenhag, this sci-fi anthology explores the lives of those who live above The Loop in compelling and thoughtful ways. Stalehnhag has built a cult following due to his depictions of imaginative alternate realities, and this unconventional narrative pairs beautifully with his work. The stories are interconnected, and the cast \u2013 including Rebecca Hall, Jonathan Pryce, and Paul Schneider \u2013 are great.\nBest horror shows on Amazon Prime\nThe Devil's Hour\nYear: 2022 - Ongoing\nSeasons: 2\nPeter Capaldi is always an intense presence on screen, whether he's spitting expletives as The Thick of It's vicious spin doctor Malcolm Tucker or acting almost entirely with his eyebrows in Doctor Who. He plays a criminal with the ability to \"remember\" the future in this exceedingly dark supernatural thriller. Jessica Raine plays a social worker who is awakened each night at the \"devil\u2019s hour\" \u2013 3:33 am.\nThese supernatural elements feed into the search for a killer, and, across the two seasons, these two very different people are drawn together by their unique relationships with time and reality. It's chilling, grubby, and very watchable stuff.\nI Know What You Did Last Summer\nYear: 2021\nSeasons: 1\nTeen slashers are always good fun, and this small screen spin on the 1990s cult classic movie had a lot in its favor. For starters, it featured Madison Iseman \u2013 star of the recent Jumanji movies \u2013 in the lead role. Plotwise, we\u2019re back where we were in the original film, following a group of friends who are stalked by a killer a year after they cover up a car accident.\nThe performances of the young cast are fun and there\u2019s a nice edge to the violent sequences. It\u2019s far from perfect, and it's easy to understand why it didn\u2019t get a second season, but that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t a fun binge-watch for horror fans.\nLove a good slasher? Read our list of the best horror movies of all time.\nThe Bondsman\nYear: 2025\nSeasons: 1\nOne of Prime Video's latest releases, The Bondsman is a blend of action, supernatural horror, and lots of gore. This is not for the faint of heart, but it's definitely a good time for those looking for something equal parts brutal and entertaining.\nThe eight-episode show stars Kevin Bacon as Hub Halloran, a murdered bounty hunter who is brought back from the dead after being chosen by the Devil to trap and send back demons that have escaped from the prison of Hell. He is tasked with chasing the creatures down before they can do too much damage, while he learns how his own sins got his soul condemned and seeks a second chance at life, love, and country music.\nDark/Web\nYear: 2019\nSeasons: 1\nAnthology stories have been a part of the horror landscape forever, and this series deploys a dose of Black Mirror into that format. There\u2019s an overarching story about the disappearance of a cyber analyst examining the dangers of the internet in the near future, but this provides the backdrop for a series of creepy stories about the intersection between tech and humanity.\nAs with any anthology, there\u2019s a huge variance in quality with the stories in Dark/Web. But for fans of internet-based horror, including the likes of Host and Unfriended, there\u2019s plenty here to get stuck into in search of scares.\nDead Ringers\nYear: 2023\nSeasons: 1\nNothing is more scary than your mind. Rachel Weisz stars in this contemporary reimagining of David Cronenberg's psychological thriller Dead Ringers. She plays dual roles in the series as twin gynecologists, Beverly and Elliott (roles played by Jeremy Irons in the original 1988 movie).\nThe two identical women truly share everything, including a desire to challenge the antiquated practices in women's healthcare, even if that involves pushing the boundaries of medical ethics. The limited series' supporting cast includes Jennifer Ehle, Hacks' Poppy Liu, and Severance's Michael Chernus. Sure, it's not traditionally scary, but there are plenty of unnerving bits in this show that will scratch your horror itch.\nFor more streaming picks, head over to our list of the best shows on Hulu and the best shows on Disney Plus.

      "text": "The 30 best movies on Disney Plus to watch right now\nFrom Avatar to Star Wars and the MCU, these are the best movies on Disney Plus to watch in August 2025\nPicking the best movies on Disney Plus is no easy task. The House of Mouse is home to some of the most influential and iconic outings in all of cinema, be that powerhouses like the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Star Wars, or some of the best animated movies ever made. Not only that, it's now also the home of Pixar, and the streaming service also has some award-winning indie flicks.\nIn short, finding your next pick for movie night can be tricky, especially when it comes to one of the best streaming services around. Well, that's where we come in. We've put together this list of the 30 best Disney movies currently streaming on the platform for your convenience. The list includes everything from classic cartoons to explosive action films and at least one certified tearjerker. We've also made sure that our picks are strictly Disney Plus affairs since US readers have to purchase bundles to get access to Hulu movies and more. Our choices below come at no extra cost to the base subscription, so you'll have to head to our list of the best Hulu movies to check out further additions.\nAnd, if you need some further guidance, we also have a list of the best shows on Disney Plus, as well as guides on how to watch all the Marvel movies in order and all the Star Wars movies in order too. But for now, let's grab the popcorn and dig into the 30 best Disney Plus movies to watch this August!\n- Does the Disney Plus free trial still exist?\n- Grab the best Disney Plus sign-up deals\nThe best movies on Disney Plus to watch in August 2025\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\nYear: 2023\nDirector: James Gunn\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 draws James Gunn's beloved MCU trilogy to a close in a poignant send-off. Kicking off after the events of Avengers: Endgame, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is still reeling from the loss of Gamora. But the galaxy isn't saving itself as Adam (Will Poulter) appears to cause trouble for this bunch of A-holes as one of their own lands themselves in serious danger.\nIn order to save Rocket (Bradley Cooper), they have to find a genetic passcode, sending the gang on a trip across the galaxy. There's an air of finality throughout this movie, which also marks Gunn's farewell from Marvel for DC adventures anew, but it's still imbued with so much comedy and levity. However, it's the emotion that works best, as GOTG 3 provides some of the most gut-wrenching moments in the MCU so far.\nBefore you dive into hyperspace, read our Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 review for more information on one of the best Marvel movies ever made.\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nAvatar\nYear: 2009\nDirector: James Cameron\nWith the Earth facing collapse due to a lack of resources, mankind has turned to pillage the planet of Pandora for the valuable mineral, unobtanium. To better understand Pandora and its big, blue, alien inhabitants, the Na'vi, the Resources Development Administration creates Na\u2019vi-human hybrids. But, when former Marine, Jake Sully, integrates with the Pandoran natives, he falls in love and vows to protect his new tribe from human invaders.\nAvatar was, quite literally, a game-changer for the medium of cinema. The stunning and highly-immersive visuals will have you believing Pandora is real, and that's all down to the impressive blend of incredible computer-generated graphics and specially-modified cameras James Cameron used. None of that works, though, without a meaningful story, and Cameron's sci-fi tale is as poignant as it is exciting.\nOnce you finish Avatar, you get ready to dive into its sequel with our Avatar: The Way of Water review or check out our guide on Avatar: Fire and Ash.\nX-Men\nYear: 2000\nDirector: Bryan Singer\nLong before the inception of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, our favorite mutants had their own sacred timeline. The first entry in the X-Men series sees Professor Charles Xavier's titular heroes clash with Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants as Senator Kelly ushers in the era of the Mutant Registration Act, laying the foundations for an epic conflict.\nLet's be honest: the X-Men are the coolest and make up some of the greatest Marvel characters around, and to see them come to life on the big screen at the turn of the millennium was, frankly, life-changing for comic book fans. This movie nailed the tone needed to make the X-Men work in live-action, featured a quintessential mutant storyline, and introduced the world to Hugh Jackman's iconic Wolverine. The one downside is we don't get the classic yellow suits, but we can live with that.\nIf you want to start watching all the X-Men movies in order, you can read our X-Men review and find out more about the first chapter.\nThe Lion King\nYear: 1994\nDirectors: Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff\nThe Lion King is often heralded as the jewel in Disney\u2019s crown and it\u2019s easy to see why. Everything about it just feels so big: the scale of the stampede sequence, the sombre tone of James Earl Jones\u2019 voice, the \u201cCircle of Life\u201d, and the grand themes of legacy and sacrifice. Thank god for Timon and Pumbaa, who step in right at the moment things start to get unbearably depressing.\nIt\u2019s an epic story painted on such an exquisite canvas, from the vast plains to the bubbling green lava of Scar\u2019s lair. It also spawned an entire generation of people who like to lift up their pets into the sky like they\u2019re Rafiki showing off baby Simba. Who knew lions could get so Shakespearean?\nThe Toy Story trilogy\nYear: 1995 - 2010\nDirectors: John Lasseter and Lee Unkrich\nPixar immediately branded itself as the studio obsessed with ambitious concepts. Their first-ever movie, Toy Story (aka one of the best Pixar movies ever made), puts forward the idea back that all your toys are alive and run around your room when you\u2019re not looking. Instead of giving kids nightmares, it was somehow endearing. So the studio kept pushing and pushing until we got to Toy Story 3, which has Woody and Buzz Lightyear come to terms with their own mortality after they are thrown into a garbage incinerator. There are some twisted geniuses at work here.\nToy Story really did, right out of the gate, establish the trademarks that have made Pixar a powerhouse animation studio. Its unusual premise has philosophical and moral underpinnings that adults can pore over and analyze to death. Meanwhile, the kids in the audience are kept entertained by bright colors, lively characters, and funny jokes.\nAs we mentioned in our Toy Story 4 review, the new film acts as a nice epilogue to the trilogy but doesn't quite compare to the first three movies.\nSister Act\nYear: 1992\nDirector: Emile Ardolino\nLounge singer Deloris Van Cartier is present for a mob hit and ends up in the witness protection program. The last place her enemies would think to look? Saint Katherine\u2019s Parish, a San Francisco convent, where she volunteers as its choir director. At first, Deloris clashes with the Reverend Mother, who disapproves of her throwing out traditional hymns in favour of gospel and rock stylings. Of course, by the time things wrap up, the two have developed a mutual respect.\nThis is peak Whoopi Goldberg \u2013 a performance where she can be cutting without being callous. And, wow, can she sing. The film\u2019s so feel-good and people-pleasing that it\u2019s hard to be cynical about it, especially when the nuns start to cover '60s classics like \u201dI Will Follow Him\u201d and \u201cMy Guy\u201d (switched to \u201cMy God\u201d). It\u2019s a reminder that sometimes it\u2019s the most simple concepts that work, like pitching a lapsed Catholic pitched against the strictest of religious institutions.\nHocus Pocus\nYear: 1993\nDirector: Kenny Ortega\nIt\u2019s sometimes a little too easy to forget that the Sanderson sisters are meant to be child-murdering villains in Hocus Pocus. After being accidentally resurrected in modern-day Salem by young Max, the trio start to cause havoc in the local town. If they\u2019re not stopped, they\u2019ll suck the soul out of every child for miles in order to maintain their vitality and youth.\nWhile it wasn\u2019t much of a hit at the time (especially with critics), Hocus Pocus has slowly grown in reputation and become a seasonal tradition. It was part of a refreshing wave of Halloween-themed movies that weren\u2019t actually horrors, alongside The Addams Family and Casper the Friendly Ghost. It\u2019s a perfect film for people who want to celebrate the holiday but are also complete scaredy cats.\nThe original Star Wars trilogy\nYear: 1977 - 1983\nDirectors: George Lucas, Irvin Kershner, and Richard Marquand\nA princess, a scoundrel, and a farm boy: it\u2019s this simple trio of characters that sparked one of the biggest cultural phenomena of all time. Each of them found their own way to save the day. Sometimes that involves taking up Jedi training and discovering your dad is the last person you\u2019d want them to be, at other times it means choking a giant slug kingpin with your bare hands. Occasionally it means getting frozen into a man-sized ice cube so you can finally pay your debts.\nThese movies have crafted a fictional universe so rich and deep, there\u2019s the constant threat that once you fall in you might never come out. Next thing you know, you\u2019re three hours deep into researching the true origins of chindinkalu flute player Droopy McCool. Star Wars is the kind of world you yearn to live in, because it\u2019s a place where the most insignificant person can become the greatest hero and where there\u2019s always hope that good can triumph over evil, no matter how bleak it might seem.\nWant new titles? Read our list of all the upcoming Star Wars movies and shows heading our way.\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy\nYear: 2003 - 2007\nDirector: Gore Verbinski\nThe franchise is concerned chiefly with the adventures of scallywag pirate Jack Sparrow, as he crosses paths with his mutinous former first mate Barbossa, the fiercely independent Elizabeth Swann, and her bland, but altogether quite sweet, love interest Will Turner. Add to that, there are curses, krakens, maelstroms, British imperialism, and a tentacle-faced Davy Jones to keep things lively.\nPeople tend to disagree a little with how good Dead Man\u2019s Chest and At World\u2019s End are in comparison to the first film (come on, though, how can you resist a giant Naomie Harris exploding into a thousand little crabs\u2026 it\u2019s so weird it\u2019s good). But there\u2019s something to be said for the ingenuity of this franchise, which cranked out old-fashioned romanticism and colourful characters from what was a 15-minute Disneyland ride. Let\u2019s just never speak of the fourth and fifth films ever again\u2026\nThe Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\nYear: 2005\nDirector: Andrew Adamson\nA retelling of the classic children's book and one of the best fantasy movies ever made, The Chronicles of Narnia follows the Pevensie children as they stumble upon a magical world. With this hidden land ruled by the evil White Witch, it's up to Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy to put an end to her tyranny and free the animals of Narnia from the endless winter.\nIt is incredible that, almost two decades later, the visual effects in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe hold up as well as they do (in fact, they're actually better than a lot of movies made today). Some adaptations try something different, but there's a lot to be said for films that stay loyal to the source material, and this family flick delivers all the heart and epic scale of the original C. S. Lewis story.\nLogan\nYear: 2017\nDirector: James Mangold\nIn a world where mutants are all but extinct, Logan (AKA Wolverine) gives everything he has to care for an ailing Professor Charles Xavier. Those efforts are strained when Laura \u2014 a young mutant who possesses the same abilities as Logan \u2014 turns up on his door, needing protection from the evil forces that created her.\nIf you're tired of the current crop of superhero movies, with their formulaic stories and light, fluffy tone, Logan is the breath of fresh air you need. It's packed with epic, uber-violent fight scenes for a start, but none of it is gratuitous. The movie is based on the best Wolverine comic book, Old Man Logan, with a powerful, painful story laying the foundations for one hell of a performance from Hugh Jackman.\nFor more information on one of the best superhero movies ever made, check out our Logan review.\nFantasia\nYear: 1940\nDirectors: Samuel Armstrong, James Algar, Bill Roberts, Paul Satterfield, Ben Sharpsteen, David D. Hand, Hamilton Luske, Jim Handley, Ford Beebe, T. Hee, Norman Ferguson, and Wilfred Jackson\nEssentially a series of shorts set to classical music, the film takes us through all manner of imaginative scenarios: from the colourful world of centaurs and fauns, the extinction of the dinosaurs, to the monstrous reign of the demon Chernabog. The most famous sequence is set to Paul Dukas\u2019 The Sorcerer\u2019s Apprentice and sees an eager Mickey accidentally summon an unstoppable army of mops.\nFantasia\u2019s arguably the most unique and artistically ambitious entry in Disney\u2019s collection of its best animated movies. There\u2019s nothing else like it. It\u2019s not fixated on talking down to children or trying to coddle them, but whisks them through the classical greats with a sense of wit and sophistication. It can be weird, sweet, psychedelic and frightening \u2013 slipping between moods and emotions with ease. Even if it\u2019s meant to be educational, it doesn\u2019t feel like any ordinary music lesson.\nThe Incredibles\nYear: 2004\nDirector: Brad Bird\nPixar's spin on the Avengers before the Avengers ever reached cinema screens, The Incredibles keeps it a strictly family affair. In the movie, public opinion has turned against superheroes. They\u2019ve been accused of leaving behind too much collateral damage. And so, the Parrs have done their best to keep quiet and hide their powers, having settled down in an idyllic American suburb. But Bob, otherwise known as Mr. Incredible, is struggling to let go of the \u201cglory days\u201d. His actions end up dragging the entire family into a deadly confrontation with an embittered former fan.\nThe Incredibles is a flawless blend of comic book movie stylings and earnest family comedy. For all the whizz-bang action, which easily rivals most live-action attempts at the genre, the film\u2019s also rich with themes - it touches on bureaucracy, the family unit, and what it means to be exceptional. Less deep, but equally exciting is Edna Mode\u2019s catchphrase, \u201cNo capes!\u201d\nAll of Us Strangers\nYear: 2023\nDirector: Andrew Haigh\nMore inspired by than strictly adapted from Taichi Yamada's elegantly eerie novel Strangers, Andrew Haigh's film is a heartbreaking masterpiece. Andrew Scott plays Adam, a lonely screenwriter living in a gloomy London tower block. One night he connects with Harry (Paul Mescal) and the two embark on a relationship. Adam goes back to his childhood home to see his parents several times, leading to some necessary conversations. The only trouble is, his parents died many years ago...\nBeautifully acted and dreamily directed, All of Us Strangers is a delicate, enigmatic film that's not at all interested in revealing precisely how or why Adam is able to reconnect with his lost family like this. Instead, it's a melancholy but ultimately hopeful meditation on time, memory, love, and loss.\nThe Emperor's New Groove\nYear: 2000\nDirector: Mark Dindal\nIt takes a lot for some people to learn their lesson. Say, being transformed into a llama. That\u2019s the fate that befalls the selfish, egotistical Kuzco, who makes an enemy of his royal adviser Yzma. She plans to poison him and take the throne for herself. Unfortunately, she has a rather unfortunate taste in henchman and the hapless Kronk accidentally swaps the vial of poison with a vial of transforming potion. Only after Kuzco faces the consequences of his actions will he finally be able to turn back.\nThe early 2000s are too easily dismissed as an era of creative bankruptcy for Disney. The Emperor\u2019s New Groove (and one other film on this list) prove otherwise. The film is fun, zippy, and genuinely funny in a way that feels worlds apart from the epics of the Disney Renaissance \u2013 and that\u2019s refreshing in its own way. And how could you possibly shun a movie where Eartha Kitt pays a villain who looks likes a decrepit, centuries-old peacock come to life?\nReady to crave some cinematic spinach puffs? Read our The Emperor's New Groove review now!\nFrozen\nYear: 2013\nDirectors: Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee\nFrozen tells the story of two sisters, Anna and Elsa, who become estranged from each other after their parents\u2019 death and from all the years Elsa has been kept isolated \u2013 all because she possesses ice powers she struggles to control. With the help of a kind-hearted ice harvester named Kristoff and his reindeer Sven, alongside a magical snowman named Olaf, the two sisters save the kingdom of Arendelle and discover the key to their special bond.\nFrozen offers the best example of the modern Disney princess, Elsa and Anna\u2019s stories don\u2019t prioritise getting rescued or finding some Prince Charming. It\u2019s their relationship that remains at the heart of everything, offering a touching tribute to the power of sisterly love. Plus, the way Idina Menzel belts out \u201cLet it Go\u201d has given us an anthem for the ages.\nWarm up by reading our in-depth Frozen review!\nInside Out\nYear: 2015\nDirector: Pete Docter\nWhat if your emotions had a emotions? That\u2019s the question at the centre of Inside Out, the most thematically ambitious of all Pixar\u2019s movies. We jump inside the head of Riley, an 11-year-old girl, and meet its colourful inhabitants: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger. They\u2019re struggling to guide Riley through the major changes that come from moving halfway across the country, after her parents relocate her from Minnesota to San Francisco.\nWhat\u2019s so profound about Inside Out is how director Pete Docter and his team found a way to directly and elegantly talk to children about depression and the necessary role that sadness has to play in our lives. It\u2019s not just an entertaining film, but an effective therapeutic tool (that extends beyond just children, considering it has a reputation for causing grown adults to start blubbering away).\nYou can read our five star Inside Out review for more details, but make sure you have a pack of tissues nearby for all those sentimental tears.\nFantastic Mr. Fox\nYear: 2009\nDirector: Wes Anderson\nRoald Dahl's iconic story is brought to life in stunning stop-motion with all the extra quirks and comedic flair you'd expect from acclaimed director, Wes Anderson. In this adaptation, Mr. Fox comes to blows with three local farmers, as he carries out clandestine missions to steal produce from the farms of Boggis, Bunce, and Bean.\nNot only does Fantastic Mr. Fox look astounding \u2014 with intricate details and playful production design \u2014 but it's also superbly smart and very, very funny. Kids will love it for the more slapstick, silly moments, but adult viewers will arguably take just as much (if not more) away from the film's more sincere and sharp social commentary. Bringing it all to life is an extraordinary voice cast at the top of their game, including George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, and Willem Dafoe.\nMind the farmers. Read our Fantastic Mr. Fox review next.\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas\nYear: 1993\nDirector: Henry Selick\nAfter being plunged into the stop-motion imaginarium of Tim Burton (although the film, in truth, was actually directed by Henry Selick), we follow Jack Skellington, otherwise known as the Pumpkin King and the most heralded resident of Halloween Town. One day, he stumbles into the portal to \u201cChristmas Town\u201d and becomes fixated on the holiday, recruiting his ghoulish friends to help him become the new \u201cSandy Claws\u201c and deliver toys to the world.\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas serves double duty as a holiday classic, since it works for both Halloween and Christmas \u2013 meaning it can be enjoyed at any point between September and January. It\u2019s also one of the finest examples of Burton\u2019s trademark blend of Gothic styling and fairy tale sensibility, where the strange and unusual are not only celebrated but represent the new norm.\nLilo & Stitch\nYear: 2002\nDirectors: Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois\nLilo, who\u2019s under the guardianship of her adult sister after the death of their parents, is in for the surprise of a lifetime when her newly adopted dog, who she names Stitch, actually turns out to be the highly dangerous Experiment 626. He\u2019s an alien genetically bred to be a tool of pure destruction. And while Stitch might not fit in at first, he soon discovers the real meaning of \u201cohana\u201d, or family.\nOut of all of Disney\u2019s animated movies, very few have a message as grounded in reality as Lilo & Stitch. It teaches kids that families come in all shapes and sizes, are functional and dysfunctional, or are bound by blood or by friendship \u2013 that doesn't mean they\u2019re any less legitimate. Not only is Stitch as adorable as can be, but he also issues the film\u2019s most heart-breaking piece of dialogue: \u201cThis is my family. I found it, all on my own. It's little, and broken, but still good. Yeah, still good.\u201d\nFor more information before adding this film to your Disney Plus watch list, read our Lilo & Stitch review.\nThe Muppet Christmas Carol\nYear: 1992\nDirector: Brian Henson\nThe story here is pretty much the same as Charles Dickens\u2019 1843 novella, you just need to swap out most of the humans for felt puppets. On Christmas Eve, the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge is given a brutal lesson in human compassion, as he\u2019s visited upon by three ghosts; the Ghost of Christmas Past (creepy), the Ghost of Christmas Present (jolly), and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come (not here to mess around), We all know how it ends.\nAlthough Muppet Treasure Island will always have its fans, The Muppet Christmas Carol is considered by many to be not only as the best Muppets movie, but one of the greatest holiday movies ever made. It captures the touching, inward-looking sentiment of the original book, while still throwing in plenty of irreverent humour to keep things feeling festive.\nYou can learn more about one of the best Christmas movies ever made by reading our The Muppet Christmas Carol review.\nMonsters, Inc.\nYear: 2001\nDirector: Pete Docter\nThe city of Monstropolis has found its own source of renewable energy: the screams of children. Sulley and his best friend Mike work at the local factory as scarers, using portals to sneak into children\u2019s bedrooms and harvest their terror so they can help power the city. One day, a little girl manages to escape and is let loose on Monstropolis, as Sulley and Mike take it upon themselves to get her home safe.\nThe brilliance of pitting John Goodman and Billy Crystal against each other makes Monsters, Inc an ingenious throwback to all of the most classic of double acts. But the film isn\u2019t just silliness for silliness\u2019 sake, and, in true Pixar tradition, it\u2019s got a heart of gold at its centre in the form of Boo, the lost girl. She forms a close bond with Sulley, who she calls \u201cKitty\u201d. It\u2019s a reminder to us all that the fear of the other is an entirely irrational thing.\nLove a good scream? Well, check out our fantastic Monsters Inc review.\nWho Framed Roger Rabbit\nYear: 1988\nDirector: Robert Zemeckis\nThe story takes place in an alternate version of 40s Hollywood were cartoon characters are real, breathing entities, but remain an oppressed minority \u2013 exploited for their work and forced to live in the segregated borough of Toontown. One of the biggest toon stars, Roger Rabbit, is falsely accused of the murder of studio head R.K. Maroon. He turns to Detective Eddie Valiant, a jaded alcoholic, in an attempt to clear his name and uncover the sinister secret lurking in the shadows.\nRoger Rabbit doesn\u2019t use its mix of live-action and animation as some kind of flashy gimmick, but as a tool to create a rich, believable world that brilliantly parodies the noir genre. It dances on the edge of risqu\u00e9 without alienating its family audience, thanks to its femme fatale Jessica Rabbit (who\u2019s not bad, just drawn that way) and the gruesome effects of Dip. It was also the first time that Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse crossed party lines and appeared onscreen together.\nSleeping Beauty\nYear: 1959\nDirectors: Clyde Geronimi, Wolfgang Reitherman, Eric Larson, and Les Clark\nBased on the Charles Perrault fairytale, while also incorporating music from Tchaikovsky's ballet of the same name, Sleeping Beauty sees a beautiful young princess named Aurora targeted by a curse from the evil fairy Maleficent. Before the sun sets on her 16th birthday, Aurora will prick her finger on a spinning wheel and be consumed by an endless sleep. The only way the curse can be lifted is through the power of true love's kiss.\nSleeping Beauty is the most beautiful Disney film ever made, with an animation style modelled after medieval tapestries and illuminated manuscripts. And thanks to the classical touch in the film\u2019s score, the final film feels so elegant and refined \u2013 it's a swoon-worthy dream just like the one Aurora sings of, where she's united with her handsome prince. Add to that, Maleficent\u2019s cackle and haughty air (she only unleashes the curse because she's offended she wasn't invited to the christening) makes her an all-time great among the Disney villains.\nThe Star Wars sequel trilogy\nYear: 2015 - 2019\nDirectors: J. J. Abrams and Rian Johnson\nThe Force Awakens had a lot riding on it. It needed to kick off the revived franchise and soothe everyone\u2019s memories of the prequels. It introduced us to a new trio of heroes: Rey, a scavenger whose mysterious origins are still hotly debated today, Finn, the stormtrooper-turned-rebel hero, and Poe, the hotshot pilot. Their journeys all intersect as the Resistance stands firm against the rising threat of the First Order. The Last Jedi continues the battle against the new enemy, and The Rise of Skywalker brings the entire Skywalker saga to an end.\nAs much as director J.J. Abrams may have played it safe by replicating the familiar beats of the original trilogy (yes, there\u2019s another Death Star) with The Force Awakens, he also revived many of the elements that were crucial to those movies attaining their classic status. Episode 7 has that same childish sense of excitement that sweeps you up and takes you on a journey across the stars, meeting all kinds of fascinating and bizarre individuals, revisiting old friends, and settling back into the eternal fight of good vs evil. The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker follow and are both divisive for their own reasons. But stick through the trilogy and be rewarded with a grand finale to this astonishing series.\nBeauty and the Beast\nYear: 1991\nDirectors: Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise\nBased on an old French fairytale, the \u201cbeauty\u201d of the film\u2019s title refers to Belle, whose love of reading has made her an outsider in her own village \u2013 probably because they think a vain, arrogant slab of meat like Gaston is the best there is. But when she becomes the prisoner of a monstrous lion/buffalo hybrid, she discovers that she\u2019s developed a very unusual case of Stockholm Syndrome.\nBeauty and the Beast is a wonderful example of what Disney does best: it uses modern technology (including computer animation, which was still in its relative infancy) and modern thinking (Belle is a smart, independent princess), but the result is still as sweepingly romantic as the oldest of folktales. That\u2019s thanks partially to the songs, created by Alan Menken and Howard Ashman.\nMary Poppins\nYear: 1964\nDirector: Robert Stevenson\nAlthough this adaptation of the P.L. Travers book series had its troubles (see Saving Mr Banks), the film was still much more warmly regarded than its source material. The Mary Poppins in question is a magical nanny who flies in to help troubled families, including the Bankses, who live on Cherry Tree Lane. The patriarch of the clan, you see, has become far too obsessed with his job at the bank and has lost sight of how much his children need him.\nIt\u2019s a fairly simple celebration of the joys of imagination and playtime, but the whole affair is wrapped up in an irresistible, whimsical bow. We get to jump into chalk paintings, float up to the ceiling, or tidy rooms with a single snap of a finger. Mary Poppins captured how limitless and full of potential the world felt as a child \u2013 which makes it as soothing for adults as it is for the little ones. And what a practically perfect presence Julie Andrews is, making Mary as stern and correct as she is secretly mischievous. Everyone needs a Mary Poppins in their life.\nThe Little Mermaid\nYear: 1989\nDirectors: John Musker and Ron Clements\nHans Christian Andersen\u2019s original version of this story was a little more upsetting than what we\u2019re used to. Instead of Ariel getting both her man and her voice back after defeating the evil sea witch Ursula, she, A. has to deal with her new human feet bleeding constantly and being agony to walk on, and, B. ends up sacrificing herself to save the prince and dissolves into a pile foam. It\u2019s hard to imagine Disney trying to market \u201cAriel as foam\u201d or \u201cAriel with realistic bleeding feet\u201d dolls.\nThe Little Mermaid kicked off the Disney Renaissance and arguably still boasts the studio\u2019s best princess. Unlike pretty much all of her predecessors, Ariel isn\u2019t some genteel, perfect doll waiting to be rescued. She drives the film\u2019s plot, and, importantly, she\u2019s deeply flawed. Rebellious and excitable, her story is defined by her curiosity and her committed belief to the idea that the grass is always greener on the other side \u2013 or, in this case, that the grass exists in the first place.\nThe Avengers movies\nYear: 2012 - 2019\nDirectors: Joss Whedon, Anthony Russo, and Joe Russo\nIt\u2019s hard to pack the entire decade-long history of the MCU into one paragraph. Weaving together characters and plotlines from every single entry of the series, the Avengers movies act as the big cornerstones for Disney and Marvel's huge series. the conclusion is, of course, Endgame. After the warmongering Thanos collects all the Infinity Stones and causes the Snap, instantly wiping out half of all living things, the surviving heroes are left to pull up their bootstraps and save the day.\nEndgame is unlike any other film that\u2019s existed before it. It\u2019s the final chapter of a story that\u2019s been gradually told over 20 different movies \u2013 including a few on this list, although we've kept only the best here. That\u2019s the kind of ambition that would be doomed to fail if Marvel didn\u2019t get the balance right: it needed to be epic on an unimaginable scale, while still servicing the characters that fans had grown so attached to over the years. We recommend \u2013 if you haven't already \u2013 diving into the Marvel movies now!\nThe Sound of Music\nYear: 1965\nDirector: Robert Wise\nThis classic musical is actually based (although it\u2019s no winner when it comes to historical accuracy) on the real-life Maria Von Trapp. She was a nun who married the Austrian naval commander Georg von Trapp and became the stepmother to his seven children. They performed concerts together under the growing shadow of Nazi rule, before packing their bags and moving to the United States. In reality, they just took a train to Italy, although the film creates a much more dramatic escape.\nIt\u2019s the unwavering sense of optimism that makes this musical sing, as best exemplified by \u201cMy Favourite Things\u201d. When the dog bites, when the bee stings, or when evil is encroaching from all sides, sometimes it\u2019s the smallest and most fragile of joys that can get us through the darkest of times.\nTo get the best deal on the streaming service, check-in with these Disney+, Hulu Bundles.\nClarisse is a freelance film journalist, and is a film critic for The Independent.

      "text": "The best new shows and movies streaming this week on Netflix, Prime Video, HBO Max, and more\nCheck out our guide to the best movies and shows streaming this week, August 11\u201317\nWelcome back to our weekly guide to the best new shows and movies! On this page, we've put together a list of six fantastic shows and movies that make a perfect package of must-see entertainment.\nOne of the year's most anticipated new shows lands this week in the terrifying form of sci-fi horror Alien: Earth. But if facehuggers and chest-bursters aren't your thing, there are still plenty of other great shows and films to watch across all the best streaming services. Some of the other things we've picked out this time around include a heart-warming fantasy movie, an exciting new spy show, and the return of time-travelling romantasy Outlander.\nSo if you're ready for a great night in, it's time to get browsing. And when you've done here, why now check out our list of the best shows on Paramount Plus for more streaming inspiration.\nAlien: Earth\nAvailable: US/UK\nWhere to watch: Hulu (US), Disney Plus (UK)\nAn Alien TV show has been teased for years, and finally arrives this week on Hulu and Disney Plus. Happily, Alien: Earth is good \u2013 really good, in fact. Set a couple of years before Ridley Scott's first film, Alien: Earth follows a group of hybrids \u2013 dying children whose minds have been transferred into synthetic adult bodies \u2013 as they are despatched to investigate a crashed spaceship in Prodigy City. They find monsters \u2013 and not just the classic xenomorph...\nSydney Chandler leads a strong cast in this eight episode horror adventure. Alien: Earth has all the body horror and gore you'd expect from this franchise, but there's also a stronger focus on the war between the mega-corporations that rule the world of Alien, as well as some philosophical elements plucked from Scott's other great science fiction film, Blade Runner. Dark and dangerous, but also fun and exciting, Alien: Earth is one of the year's best new shows.\nWill the show make you scream with delight? Find out with our Alien: Earth review.\nButterfly\nAvailable: UK/US\nWhere to watch: Amazon Prime Video\nAnother week, another streaming spy thriller. Butterfly immediately caught our eye, however, for giving a well-deserved leading role to Lost's Daniel Dae Kim. He plays David Jung, a retired intelligence agent who returns to South Korea to try and connect with his daughter Rebecca (Reina Hardesty). It's not an easy reunion, however. Rebecca has spent years operating under the belief that her father was dead and, in the meantime, has become an assassin for CADDIS \u2013 the private outfit that David previously set up with his former partner, Juno (Piper Perabo).\nBased on Arash Amel's graphic novel of the same name, Butterfly mixes bullets and explosions with a heartfelt relationship drama. It's a cliche to say that an action drama is all about family, but this one really is. Still, when it comes time to deliver some propulsive thrills and explosive action, Butterfly does not disappoint.\nCheck out our guide to the best Amazon Prime Video shows.\nThe Monkey\nAvailable: US\nWhere to watch: Hulu\n\"Everybody dies. And that's f**ked up.\" That's the tagline for Longlegs director Osgood Perkins' latest horror spectacular. The Monkey (based on Stephen King's short story of the same name) lives up to that fatalistic promise, offering as grand a smorgasbord of grimly hilarious death and destruction as any Final Destination movie. It follows an estranged father, Hal, played by Theo James, and son Petey (Colin O'Brien) as they try to resolve their differences, while also surviving their connection to a cursed toy monkey.\nThe Monkey is grimly hilarious \u2013 both brutal and slapstick in its violence. Despite the nihilistic themes that run through the film. However, it's also a fun and refreshing antidote to the trauma-wallowing of some recent horror films. Recommended for those with a strong stomach.\nFind out what our critic thought of the movie with our Monkey review.\nNight Always Comes\nAvailable: US/UK\nWhere to watch: Netflix\nFantastic Four's Vanessa Kirby stars in this gripping crime thriller based on Willy Vlautin's novel of the same name. Set in Portland, Night Always Comes follows Lynette, a woman who is struggling to make ends meet while working multiple jobs and also looking after her brother Kenny (Zack Gottsagen). When her plan to finally buy a home goes wrong, however, she puts everything on the line in order to try and save it.\nDirected by Benjamin Caron, who previously helmed several standout episodes of Andor's first season, Night Always Comes takes place over one intense and stressful evening. Joining Kirby in the cast are Eli Roth and Uncut Gems' Julia Fox. Will this be as fist-gnawingly stressful as that movie? Quite possibly...\nFind something great to watch with our list of the best Netflix movies.\nThe Legend of Ochi\nAvailable: US/UK\nWhere to watch: HBO Max\nOne of the year's most charming movies arrives on HBO Max this week. The Legend of Ochi opens on the isolated island of Carpathia and follows Yuri (Helena Zengel), a young farm girl who has grown up being told that she must never go outside after dark because of fearsome creatures called Ochi. One day, however, she discovers an injured baby Ochi. This sets her on a perilous journey to reunite it with its family.\nWritten and directed by Isaiah Saxon, this gorgeous fantasy adventure uses puppetry and a host of other practical special effects to realise its story. Willem Dafoe, Emily Watson, and Finn Wolfhard are the big names in the cast, but the heart of the story really belongs to Zengel's Yuri and her cute little Ochi friend.\nFind out what else is on the streamer with our guide to the best HBO Max movies.\nOutlander season 7, part 1\nAvailable: US/UK\nWhere to watch: Netflix\nThe seventh season of this surprisingly enduring historical romance lands on Netflix today, just as a prequel series \u2013 Outlander: Blood of My Blood also comes to Starz in the US. For those who haven't seen the show, which is based on the series of books by Diana Gabaldon, Outlander is about Claire Randall (Caitriona Balfe), a married nurse from 1945 who finds herself transported back in time to the 1700s where she meets Jamie, a handsome Highland warrior, played by Sam Heughan.\nOutlander launched all the way back in 2014 and has rambled on since then \u2013 always a bit daft, but also always compelling thanks to the dynamic between Balfe and Heughan and the show's capacity for wild plot twists. Hardcore fans will likely have already seen this season on Starz. For everyone else, here's your chance to get caught up before the eighth and final season in 2026.\nLooking for something else to watch? Check out our list of the best movies on Disney Plus.\nWill Salmon is the Streaming Editor for GamesRadar+.

      "text": "GamesRadar+ Verdict\nBold, ambitious, and often brutally violent \u2013 is this the best xenomorph story since James Cameron's Aliens? On the basis of the first six episodes it sure feels like it. Alien: Earth has it's flaws, but it's never less than ferociously entertaining.\nPros\n- +\nAn atmospheric and immersive return to the world of Alien\n- +\nThe cast are terrific \u2013 and sometimes terrifying\n- +\nGreat creature effects\nCons\n- -\nSome weak and misplaced humor\n- -\nThe Lost Boys are a great idea, but not always well-plotted\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nThis review is spoiler-free.\nThis has been a long time coming. The show that became Alien: Earth was announced back in 2019, with Fargo and Legion showrunner Noah Hawley officially attached the following year. A lot has changed since then.\nAt the time, the xenomorph franchise felt pretty moribund, with 2017's Alien: Covenant faring poorly both critically and commercially. In the years since, however, the series (along with its sister franchise Predator) has seen a fairly remarkable renaissance. Last year's Alien: Romulus was a solid hit at the box office and was generally liked by fans, despite its tendency to wallow in unnecessary references and call-backs.\nAlien: Earth, then, arrives with both optimistic hype and not a little trepidation from fans. There's been confusion over when the show is set (2120 \u2013 two years before the Nostromo has its fateful encounter on LV-426), while a stray comment from FX Entertainment president Gina Balian about the show existing \"in parallel\" to the movies led some fans to panic and assume that this was going to be set in an alternate universe.\nWell, unless the show does something drastically bizarre in its final two episodes (critics have been provided with six of the first season's eight instalments), that's not the case at all. This is very much the world of Ridley Scott's first film, plausibly expanded and with a stronger focus on the corporate intrigue that has always hovered around the edges of these films. The result is an imperfect series, but arguably the franchise's strongest outing since James Cameron's Aliens. Seriously \u2013 at its best, it really is that good.\nDeep impact\nWeyland-Yutani ship the USCSS Maginot is returning from a 65-year-long deep space mission gathering extraterrestrial samples when something goes wrong \u2013 you can guess what, though things are more complicated in that regard than they first appear. The ship crashes to Earth, slamming straight into New Siam, a city under the control of Prodigy, the youngest of \"the Five\" \u2013 the mega corporations that now control the Earth.\nFor Boy Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin), Prodigy's 'move fast and break things' CEO, the timing is perfect. In a world where synthetics are relatively commonplace, Prodigy has developed something new. Experimenting on terminally ill children, Kavalier and his team have seemingly discovered a way to transfer a young human consciousness into an artificial adult body. This leads to some of the show's most troubling and thought-provoking sequences, though anyone concerned the show might venture into icky Poor Things territory can breathe easy, as Alien: Earth thankfully never goes there.\nThe \"Lost Boys\" \u2013 Kavalier's name for his hybrid squad, and one of the show's many Peter Pan allegories \u2013 are the ideal team to dispatch to the crash site and bring back the alien samples. The team's de facto leader, Wendy (Sydney Chandler), has her own reasons for wanting to get to the Maginot. Meanwhile, Yutani (Sandra Yi Sencindiver) wants her deadly cargo back...\nRelease date: August 12 (US), August 13 (UK)\nAvailable on: Hulu (US), Disney Plus (UK)\nShowrunner: Noah Hawley\nEpisodes reviewed: 6 of 8\nAlien: Earth's opening two episodes (both of which are available on launch day) are a masterclass in giving fans of the franchise what they want while also broadening the scope of the story. The show borrows plentifully from the \"cassette futurism\" of Ridley Scott's original movie, both in the Maginot's set \u2013 a beautiful reproduction of the interior of the Nostromo \u2013 and in the look of the wider world, but mercifully avoids the constant call-backs that littered Romulus.\nAt the same time, there are aesthetic touches that might throw some fans \u2013 for the first time in an Alien project, there are needle drops. While none of the songs here feel out of place or ill-considered, it's definitely a little strange the first time it happens. Alien has never been a TV show before, and seeing this familiar franchise morph slightly to fit into an entirely different medium can be disconcerting.\nAnother bug hunt?\nAs the show moves into its middle episodes the focus turns more fully onto the Lost Boys \u2013 and stumbles slightly. Hawley finds pleasingly different roles for each of the characters in his story, but while the cast are all strong, the series bites off more than it can chew with the notion that these are children in adult bodies.\nThat leads episode 3 to dabble briefly with humor, a tone that sits uneasily with the overwhelmingly ominous mood of the rest of the series. And while it makes sense that these characters are more naive than the adult humans, they sometimes make some frustratingly dumb decisions.\nStill, the hybrids also provide the show with much of its disquieting heart. The question of whether Prodigy really has saved the lives of five sick kids \u2013 or simply murdered them and pasted their memories into a bunch of androids \u2013 lingers uneasily over the series.\nThere's also no questioning Sydney Chandler's Wendy. It's a terrific central performance, both cooly competent and youthfully inquisitive. Wendy's tender concern for Alex Lawther's human Hermit is effective and touching, but she also has more than enough steel to believably handle the alien-battling action.\nSpeaking of which, much has been made of Alien: Earth's introduction of four new species of critter. It's a bold decision: collectively, the egg, facehugger, and xenomorph make for some of the most memorable monsters in cinema history. None of the new creatures are as potent (though the baleful glare of a contaminated sheep quickly becomes one of the show's most indelible and unnerving images), but they add a refreshing unpredictability to the show's more horrific moments.\nThe classic alien, too, is well-handled. At times it feels more brutal and bestial than we've seen since Alien 3, at others more weirdly graceful. It's a more enigmatic presence here than the man-sized bugs of Aliens, though no less dangerous.\nBut while Alien: Earth doesn't skimp on the monsters and gore, it's the human \u2013 and android \u2013 horror that lingers the most. Babou Ceesay's Morrow is the show's most intriguing and terrifying character, and a dangerous mystery who only fully comes into focus in the more-or-less self-contained fifth episode.\nSamuel Blenkin's Kavalier, meanwhile, represents a different kind of villainy. Backed up by Adrian Edmondson's officious Atom Eins, they deliver on the banal corporate cruelty previously represented by Paul Reiser's Carter Burke in Aliens, and hinted at in Romulus's opening scenes in the run-down colony on Jackson's Star. This is a world where being fired is as good as a death sentence, and a work contract (or an off-world mission) is a life-changing and family-wrecking event.\nThe perfect organism?\nAs we noted up top, critics have not been sent the season's final two episodes just yet. Because of that and a few slightly misjudged moments along the way, we can't say that Alien: Earth is an unqualified success. Still, from what we've seen so far, this is ferociously good television: ambitious, exciting, and beautifully realized. It's tangibly the same franchise, but it also feels fresh and new.\nPart 6 ends with a lot up in the air \u2013 too much, perhaps, to fully wrap up in just two more episodes. Noah Hawley has indicated that he envisions the series as a multi-season affair, but as yet it's unclear if that means each year will be a standalone tale or if this is an ongoing story. On the basis of these first six episodes, we have to assume the latter.\nWhat Hawley and his team have done here, however, is build on the foundations of Ridley Scott's original to create a believable and fascinating universe, one that's ripe with the opportunity for further exploration. There's nothing here so far that explicitly contradicts the later films, or Scott's divisive prequels, but Alien: Earth successfully restores a sense of mystery to this universe while also delivering some fantastic action sequences, lashings of gore, and compelling characters. If not quite a perfect organism, the alien's latest evolution is still a monstrous success.\nAlien: Earth is streaming on Hulu in the US from August 12, and on Disney Plus in the UK from August 13.\nFor more, check out our look ahead at the most exciting upcoming TV shows.\nWill Salmon is the Streaming Editor for GamesRadar+.

Whatever criteria you're looking for, whether it be access to your favorite shows, the price, or if the best Netflix movies are still the obvious winners, we've outlined the options to help you make an informed choice.\nPerhaps you want a reliable service for movie night, the best anime, or shows like The Last of Us season 2. Whatever it is, we've done the research for you. In this guide to the best streaming services, we've accounted for library size, cost, and user experience, giving you all the info you need to find a streamer that fits your specific needs.\nNetflix\nAvailable: Worldwide\nPrice: $17.99/month (Standard plan) / \u00a312.99/month (Standard plan)\nNetflix is the elder statesman of streamers, having launched in 2007 (though the company itself stretches all the way to the late '90s, having started as a mail order DVD rental service). It's also still arguably the most comprehensive, with thousands of shows and movies to choose from and an easy-to-use UI.\nIt has its share of issues, of course \u2013 namely a recent price increase and a tendency for content to come and go from the service, due to licensing. It's no longer home to Friends and The Office, for example. That said, the catalog of shows that it does have is enviable. Squid Game, Bridgerton, You, Cobra Kai, and Black Mirror are among the biggest shows on the planet, and Stranger Things season 5 is sure to be event viewing, and there's some stunning Netflix anime series. The Netflix Originals strand means that the service is an enticing draw for movie lovers too. If you're only going to sub to one streamer then Netflix is probably the one for you.\nRead more: Already signed up? Why not check out the best shows on Netflix?\nDisney Plus\nAvailable: Worldwide\nPrice: $9.99/month (Standard plan) / \u00a38.99/month (Standard plan)\nIf you love Marvel, Star Wars, or Disney movies then a Disney Plus subscription is a no-brainer. With over 600 movies and TV shows at launch, the House of Mouse's streaming service is jam-packed with childhood classics as well as new shows and movies.\nDisney Plus is where you'll find all the upcoming Marvel movies and shows, including the likes of Daredevil: Born Again and Ironheart. It's the only place where you can see new Star Wars shows too, including the critical smash that is Andor season 2. Then, of course, there's Disney itself \u2013 arguably the biggest entertainment brand in the world thanks to classics like The Lion King, Frozen, and The Little Mermaid, all of which are available here.\nIt's pretty cheap, too, in comparison to some of its competitors and there's a Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN package for $16.99 a month in the US, which sweetens the deal. There are also Disney Plus downloads that allow you to download content for offline viewing. Our Disney Plus bundles page has the best options for countries around the world.\nRead more: Find the best movies on Disney Plus.\nPrime Video\nAvailable: Worldwide\nPrice: $8.99/month ($139/year) / \u00a38.99/month (\u00a395/year)\nAs you might expect coming from Amazon, one of the biggest companies in the world, Prime Video is absolutely stacked with movies and shows. OK, so it might not have the same level of big name show recognition as some of the content on Netflix or Disney Plus, but there's still some of the best TV shows here including The Boys (and its spin-off Gen V), Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, and The Marvelous Ms. Maisel to name just a few.\nIt's good value, too. If you have an Amazon Prime membership then you'll get Prime Video bundled in alongside loads of other extras. You can also expand the content available with bolt on services such as the art house movie-focused MUBI plus various anime channels. Region-locking is a bit of a pain, but it's hard to argue with Prime's combination of eye-catching shows (The Boys season 5 for one...) and value for money.\nRead more: Check out the best shows on Amazon Prime and the best movies on Amazon Prime.\nMax\nAvailable: US, Europe, Japan, Latin America\nPrice: $16.99/month (ad-free) / $9.99 (with ads)\nMax (formerly HBO Max) is where you'll find Warner Bros. Discovery's latest and greatest. Upcoming projects to look out for include a Green Lantern TV show in the works, House of the Dragon season 3, and the Harry Potter TV show. But not everything has to be shiny and new to be worthwhile.\nYou're also getting complete access to HBO's incredible library, which means if you've missed out on The Sopranos, The Leftovers, Deadwood, or The Wire, you can rest easy knowing they'll be there for you. Speaking of, Friends is also streaming on Max exclusively. Sadly, Max isn't in the UK yet. There's also no denying that $16.99/month is a little steep. Still, you're getting loads of viewing material here, especially when you factor in content from Adult Swim, Cartoon Network, Warner, and Crunchyroll. Plus, the entire Studio Ghibli collection.\nRead more: For a deeper dive into the service, look at our list of the best movies on Max and the best shows on Max.\nApple TV Plus\nAvailable: US, UK, Canada, Latin America, Europe, Russia, Africa, Turkey, Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Central Asia\nPrice: $9.99/month / \u00a38.99/month\nApple TV Plus focuses on high-quality shows with household names instead of the scattershot approach of some of its rivals. You'll find plenty of limited series starring A-listers and a small collection of original films. Jennifer Aniston (The Morning Show), Aaron Paul (Truth Be Told), and Hailee Steinfeld (Dickinson) formed part of Apple TV Plus' opening salvo, with visionaries such as JJ Abrams and M. Night Shyamalan two of the many directors who preferred Apple's approach.\nBut compared to its contemporaries, Apple TV Plus struggles to draw attention. In a crowded marketplace, it\u2019s destined to get lost in the background as far more eye-catching services stake their claim. That being said, there's no better service if you prefer quality over quantity. Severance season 2 was a huge hit, and the streamer just debuted the hotly-anticipated Your Friends & Neighbors. Another good mark for Apple TV is that it's one of the services that still offers free trials, and many new Apple products also come with several months free.\nRead more: Find out about the Apple TV Plus prices and read our list of the best Apple TV Plus shows.\nHulu\nAvailable: US\nPrice: $9.99/month (Basic) / $18.99/month (Premium)\nHulu was once the go-to streaming service for those who didn't want to pay for cable. It still operates effectively in that regard, though now has the additional benefit of a handful of top-quality original shows, such as The Handmaid's Tale, that make the small outlay even more worthwhile. But Hulu's main selling point is still that you can watch network TV shortly after it airs, including shows on major networks such as ABC and Fox.\nAs a substitute for paying for a cable provider, there's no better. As a streaming service, though, it's lacking in some regards. The animation on offer is great (Family Guy, Rick and Morty, Bob's Burgers), though there's no more than one or two killer must-watch shows, and the Basic package includes ads. It's not currently available on its own in the UK \u2013 so Brits will have to head to Disney Plus to access the shows and movies on offer. If you're in the US though, you\u2019re in luck.\nRead more: See our extensive rundown of the latest Hulu prices and bundle deals.\nPeacock\nAvailable: US, Europe, Africa, India\nPrice: $7.99/month (ad-free)\nComedy is a big draw to NBC's streaming service. It houses sitcom royalty like The Office, Parks & Recreation, and Brooklyn Nine-Nine. The collection of movies and shows is mixed. Many will lap up Shrek, Hell's Kitchen, and the Bourne movies, but mileage may vary. NBC is looking to make waves elsewhere, too, with original and live content.\nA new season of Rian Johnson's ace whodunnit Poker Face has just landed on the streamer, and a spin-off of The Office is in development. Whether the latter comes to pass is up in the air, but it's proof that NBC wants to compete in the arena of big original productions. Sports also have a place here as non-televised NBC Premier League games are available on Peacock as well as WWE content. With so many services on offer, Peacock might be best playing second fiddle to another larger one. Alongside Netflix or Amazon Prime, this could be well worth the outlay. It used to have a free option, but it's no longer available to new customers.\nRead more: For more information on signing up, check out the latest Peacock TV costs.\nNow TV\nAvailable: UK\nPrice: \u00a39.99/month (Entertainment) / \u00a39.99/month (Sky Cinema) / \u00a334.99/six months (Sports)\nFor those looking to watch HBO Max in the UK, Now TV presents a fairly cheap, straightforward way of accessing some of your favorite box sets and movies without having to pay for a Sky or Virgin Media subscription.\nThere are no exclusives of its own to speak of, but Now TV regularly gives viewers the latest and greatest TV shows immediately after airing. Shows like House of the Dragon are available on the same day as Sky Atlantic through the Entertainment Pass. However, the negatives can outweigh the positives. Some heavy hitters (such as The Walking Dead and South Park) were removed in 2020. And wanting everything costs a pretty penny, which may see you scrambling for an all-in-one television package instead of the myriad of passes.\nRead more: For more information on signing up, read how you can use Now TV to watch HBO Max in the UK.\nFor new streaming picks, check out our lists of all the new TV shows this year!\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nI'm the Senior Entertainment Writer here at GamesRadar+, focusing on news, features, and interviews with some of the biggest names in film and TV.

      "text": "The best new shows and movies streaming this week on Netflix, Crunchyroll, Disney Plus, and more\nCheck out our guide to the best movies and shows streaming this week, July 14\u2013July 20\nWelcome back to our weekly guide to the best new shows and movies. Here on this page we've selected six of the must-see TV shows and films, all of which are available to stream this week.\nIf you've been struggling to find something to watch then this handy list is here to help you out with some streaming inspiration. We've scoured all of the best streaming services, including Netflix, Prime Video, Disney Plus, and more to find the hottest new shows and movies that will brighten up your week.\nThis week we have the return of Star Trek to Paramount Plus, a gripping new thriller series on Netflix, and Nick Frost horror comedy Get Away hacks and slashes its way to Hulu. So if you're ready to find your next essential watch, go find some snacks, sit back, and let's plan your week's viewing.\nStar Trek: Strange New Worlds season 3\nAvailable: US/UK\nWhere to watch: Paramount Plus\nThe best of the modern Star Trek shows returns for its third season. Kicking off with the resolution to last season's big cliffhanger, which saw Captain Pike (Anson Mount) and the crew of the Enterprise facing down a deadly Gorn fleet, the new run of 10 episodes then takes in a very messy wedding, an away mission that takes a turn for the sinister, an archaeological adventure, and much more.\nAs ever Strange New World is diverse in tone, straddling sci-fi action, comedy, and even some pretty effective horror. The show takes some big swings \u2013 admittedly some of which work better than others \u2013 and the crew remains as reliably charming as ever. Mount in particular is excellent as the immaculately-coiffed Captain cursed with the foreknowledge of a bleak future but determined to make the most of his life regardless.\nFind out what we made of the new episodes with our Star Trek: Strange New Worlds season 3 review.\nUntamed\nAvailable: UK/US\nWhere to watch: Netflix\nEric Bana and Sam Neill star in Netflix's latest crime miniseries. Set in the beautiful expanse of the Yosemite National Park, Untamed opens with the discovery of a woman's body at the bottom of El Capitan \u2013 seemingly killed in a climbing accident. National Park Service agent Kyle Turner (Eric Bana) isn't convinced, however, and he soon finds himself hunting a killer. With close to a million acres of wilderness in the park, however, that's going to be no easy task...\nBana's Turner is your classic troubled detective, haunted by a tragedy in his past that he must reckon with in the present, all while getting to grips with new partner Naya Vasquez (Lily Santiago) and various problems in the park. This looks like a good, twisty mystery enlivened by the stunning locations and Bana and Neill's charisma.\nCheck out our guide to the best Netflix shows.\nGet Away\nAvailable: US/UK\nWhere to watch: Hulu/NOW TV\nThis British horror comedy stars Shaun of the Dead's Nick Frost and plays out like a less harrowing and more amusing take on Midsommar. Frost plays Richard Smith who, along with his wife Susan (Aisling Bea), and kids Sam (Sebastian Croft) and Jessie (Maisie Ayres), take a holiday on Svalta, a remote Swedish island. The locals there are far from impressed by the arrival of these holidaymakers and it's not long before the blood starts to flow...\nDirected by Steffen Haars and written by Frost himself (in his first solo writing venture), Get Away is a likeable mix of gore and gags with a pretty killer twist. It's not quite of the same pedigree as the films that Frost made with Edgar Wright (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and The World's End) but it's well worth a watch, with Aisling Bea particularly excelling as the tough and resourceful Susan. Get Away lands on Hulu in the US on July 15 and can be found in the UK on NOW TV.\nKaiju No. 8 season 2\nAvailable: US/UK\nWhere to watch: Crunchyroll\nThis monster-hunting anime is currently sitting pretty with a perfect 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes for its first season. We'll see if it can maintain that hit rate later this week when season 2 of the series lands on Crunchyroll. For those who haven't seen it, Kaiju No. 8 follows Kafka Hibino, a young man who has the ability to transform into a kaiju. Trouble is, Kafka has made a solemn oath that one day he will be a part of the Japanese Anti-Kaiju Defense Force.\nThe end of season one saw Kafka's secret revealed. As a kaiju he fought with members of the Defense Force. Rather than be killed, however, Kafka was eventually recruited into the squad, as an anti-kaiju weapon. Season 2 picks up from there with another 11 episodes of monster-bashing mayhem on Crunchyroll.\nCheck out the first trailer for Kaiju No. 8 season 2.\nNormal People\nAvailable: US/UK\nWhere to watch: Hulu/Disney Plus\nThis Irish romantic drama was a major breakout role for both Paul Mescal and Daisy Edgar-Jones back in 2018. Adapted from Sally Rooney's beloved bestselling novel, Normal People documents the relationship between Marianne Sheridan (Edgar-Jones) and Connell Waldron (Mescal), through high school and university. It's a tumultuous time in both their lives and this achingly sensitive drama follows the highs and lows of their on-again/off-again romance over 12 gripping, addictive episodes.\nNormal People has been streaming on Hulu in the US for some time. Now it's coming to Disney Plus in the UK meaning this is a great opportunity to see a beautiful, melancholy drama that helped boost both its leads to stardom.\nMamma Mia!\nAvailable: US/UK\nWhere to watch: Netflix\nThis jukebox musical, based around the songs of ABBA, was a big hit back in 2008 despite some pretty mixed reviews. Meryl Streep plays Donna Sheridan, a hotel owner in Greece who is excitedly getting ready for her daughter Sophie's wedding. Little does she know, however, that Sophie has invited three of Donna's old flames along in the hope of finally finding out once and for all who her father is. Trouble is, even her mom doesn't know...\nCue several \u2013 literal \u2013 song and dance numbers as Donna and her former lovers (played by Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, and Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd) try to get to the bottom of the paternity mystery. It's all very silly but also a lot of big-hearted fun. And let's face it, you can't argue with ABBA.\nLooking for something else to watch?

      "text": "The best new TV shows coming your way in 2025\nFrom Slow Horses to Gen V, these are the best new TV shows still to come this year\nWhen it comes to picking the best new TV shows of 2025, it's tough because there are just so many great options. This year has already seen a slew of hits from multiple streaming services, such as Squid Game season 3 and, most recently, Alien: Earth and Peacemaker season 2. However, despite being over halfway through 2025, there's still plenty more for us to look forward to.\nAugust has been a strong month for TV, giving us some of the most anticipated new DC shows and horror outings of the year. However, looking further ahead, we also have Wednesday season 2 part 2, some more superhero action with a The Boys spin-off, and even the adorable return of one of the best Netflix shows Pokemon Concierge. Basically, there's something for every kind of TV fan still on the streaming horizon, no matter what genre is your go-to choice. There's a lot to get through, but we've decided to highlight our personal top picks still to come.\nSo what are you waiting for? Scroll on down for our handy guide on all the best new TV shows releasing in 2025 on the best streaming services out there, from Netflix and HBO Max, to Apple TV Plus. These shows are in order of release date, too, to make your watchlist a little easier to organize. Happy binge-watching!\nPeacemaker season 2\nRelease date: Out now!\nAvailable on: HBO Max\nJohn Cena returns as Peacemaker (after his Superman cameo) in season 2 of the hit DC show, which has now started to release weekly episodes. The new season is officially part of the new DCU Chapter One: Gods and Monsters, too, and (as we point out in our Peacemaker season 2 review) does a great job at explaining how the character's new DCU place fits despite its previous DCEU status. The series will be running through until October, and you can find out more on when to catch the next episode with our Peacemaker season 2 release schedule guide.\nThe Terminal List: Dark Wolf\nRelease date: August 27, 2025\nAvailable on: Prime Video\nDark Wolf is a new spin-off of Prime Video action thriller The Terminal List. The prequel follows the origin story of Taylor Kitsch's Chief Special Warfare Operator Ben Edwards as he's discharged from the Navy SEALS and forced to join the clandestine side of CIA Special Operations. Chris Pratt also returns as Lieutenant Commander James Reece, and Luke Hemsworth and The Umbrella Academy's Tom Hopper are new additions to the cast.\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nWednesday season 2 part 2\nRelease date: Part 2 drops on September 3, 2025\nAvailable on: Netflix\nJenna Ortega made her return as our favorite homicidal maniac in Wednesday season 2 part 1 in August. However, her sophomore year is far from over, as after coming face to face with the Hyde once again (read our Wednesday season 2 part 1 ending explained for more on that), Wednesday looks to have her work cut out for her in season 2 part 2. As Wednesday further investigates what the Avian was really up to, the next part will hopefully answer some of our burning questions, like where is Ophelia, and when will Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux star Lady Gaga, whose role is still a mystery, appear in the series.\nPokemon Concierge season 2\nRelease date: September 4, 2025\nAvailable on: Netflix\nThe adorable Pokemon stop-motion series returns to Netflix with a long-awaited second season as new Pokemon Resort employee Haru settles into her role and encounters new challenges \u2013 and guests. These include Sealeo, Shinx, Corphish, and Arcanine, as well as her ex-boyfriend\u2026\nOnly Murders in the Building Season 5\nRelease date: September 9, 2025\nAvailable on: Hulu/Disney Plus\nOnly Murders in the Building is one of the best shows on Hulu, so we're delighted to see that we are officially getting a season 5 in just a few days! Starring Steve Martin, Martin Short, and Selena Gomez as our favorite true crime trio, this new season will pick up where season 4's cliffhanger ended. Basically, last season ended with Lester (Teddy Coluca) found dead, so expect a new mystery to unfold soon!\nThe Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon season 3\nRelease date: September 12, 2025\nAvailable on: AMC Plus\nCarol and Daryl swap France for Spain in the third season of The Walking Dead spin-off The Walking Dead: Daryl Dixon. Not so much a European jolly over the summer, but more of a desperate attempt to get back home to the States, the new installment is sure to see everyone's favorite apocalypse survivors face off against decomposing nasties and still-living baddies.\nGen V season 2\nRelease date: September 17, 2025\nAvailable on: Prime Video\nGen V season 2 is bringing us back to Godolkin University, and we can't wait to see what's next. Season 1 ended with the main characters trapped in the lab, and we know that what happened in The Boys season 4 (you know, Homelander taking over the Oval Office) will directly affect Gen V's timeline. This means that the new episodes won't see the Supe students doing much studying, for better or worse. The new season will introduce a mysterious new Dean who preaches a curriculum that promises to make students more powerful than ever, while Marie, Jordan, and Emma deal with months of trauma and loss. The spin-off show is coming back this year ahead of The Boys season 5, so make sure you tune in for the action.\nSlow Horses season 5\nRelease date: September 24, 2025\nAvailable on: Apple TV Plus\nGary Oldman and his team of MI5 rejects are coming back this year for Slow Horses season 5, which has confirmed its release date for September. We can't think of a better way to go back to school, honestly, as we get ready for more unexpected plot twists and espionage action. Based on Mick Herron's book London Rules, the new episodes of the fan-favorite Apple TV Plus show will see everyone feeling suspicious of Roddy Ho's new girlfriend, which will only be the start of a series of bizarre events happening across London. The Slow Horses will have to try to work out how everything is connected.\nChad Powers\nRelease date: September 30, 2025\nAvailable on: Hulu\nHit Man and Twisters star Glen Powell returns to the small screen with new Hulu comedy series Chad Powers. Powell stars as a disgraced college football quarterback, Russ Holliday, who disguises himself as the affable Chad Powers to join a struggling team to reboot his career. The show was co-created by Powell and Avengers: Doomsday screenwriter Michael Waldron.\nMarvel Zombies\nRelease date: October 3, 2025\nAvailable on: Disney Plus\nGet ready to usher in the spooky season with one of our most anticipated upcoming Marvel shows of the year, Marvel Zombies. We first saw the undead superheroes appear on an episode of What If...? years ago, showing us an alternate timeline where Earth's mightiest heroes (and villains) have been turned into zombies. During the series' four episodes, we'll see a group of survivors have to travel and survive on their quest to find a cure. Sign us up!\nStar Wars: Visions season 3\nRelease date: October 29, 2025\nAvailable on: Disney Plus\nOver two years after the last installment, animated anthology series Star Wars: Visions is back for a third season. Consisting of nine new episodes, three of these are sequels to season 1 episodes (The Duel, The Village Bride, and The Ninth Jedi, specifically). This time around, new animation studios enlisted behind the scenes include Polygon Pictures, who recently worked on Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, and Wit Studio, who also make Spy x Family.\nThe Diplomat season 3\nRelease date: Fall 2025\nAvailable on: Netflix\nKeri Russell returns as Kate Wyler, the US ambassador to the UK, in the third season of Netflix's hit political thriller The Diplomat. Along with returning cast members Rory Kinnear, Rufus Sewell, and Allison Janney, The West Wing's Bradley Whitford joins the cast for the new installment. \"Season 3 flips the chessboard,\" creator Debora Cahn previously told Tudum. \"In season 3, Kate lives the particular nightmare that is getting what you want.\"\nStranger Things season 5\nRelease date: November 26 (Part 1), December 25 (Part 2), December 31 (Part 3)\nAvailable on: Netflix\nStranger Things season 5 is the final installment in the hit Netflix show, which means it's not one to miss. So far, the plot is shrouded in mystery, but we're expecting an emotional send-off for the Hawkins cohort. \"We know what the ending is,\" Matt Duffer previously said during an interview with our sister publication SFX. \"It's conceivable that it changes, but I think it's unlikely because it's one of those endings that just feels, and has always felt, right. It also feels sort of inevitable. Then when you come up with it, you're like, 'Oh yeah, well, that is absolutely what it has to be.'\"\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians season 2\nRelease date: December 10, 2025\nAvailable on: Disney Plus\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians, one of Disney Plus' biggest original shows ever, finally returns for season 2 this December. Based on the series of YA books by Rick Riordan, the show follows the adventures of Percy, a tweenage demigod and the son of Poseidon, and his best friends Annabeth and Grover. After season 1's mishaps, Percy and pals return to Camp Half Blood one year later only to find more trouble waiting for them: they're under threat from Kronos, and Percy must venture into the Sea of Monsters to find the Golden Fleece to save them.\nWonder Man\nRelease date: December 2025\nAvailable on: Disney Plus\nYahya Abdul-Mateen II stars in this new Marvel show as Wonder Man, which was first announced back in 2022. The show follows Simon Williams, a superpowered actor and stuntman, who finds himself up for the role of a lifetime: the lead in a superhero TV show. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings director Destin Daniel Cretton and Hawkeye's Andrew Guest are on board as showrunners, and Ben Kingsley returns as Trevor Slattery.\nIt: Welcome to Derry\nRelease date: TBC 2025\nAvailable on: Max\nThis show is set to explore the origins of Pennywise, focused on the Hanlon family (Mike Hanlon is one of the kids in the Losers Club). \"It's so rich with characters and events, we thought we would do justice to the book and the fans by going back into this world,\" Andy and Barbara Muschietti told EW of the show. \"Specifically, we are telling the stories of the interludes, writings by Mike Hanlon based on his investigation that includes interviews he conducts with the older people in the town. In Welcome to Derry, we touch on the usual themes that were talked about in the movie \u2013 friendship, loss, the power of unified belief \u2013 but this story also focuses on the use of fear as a weapon, which is one of the things that is also relevant to our times.\"\nFor more on new releases, check out our lists of the most exciting movie release dates to look out for and upcoming DC movies and shows.\nI\u2019m the Deputy Entertainment Editor here at GamesRadar+, covering TV and film for the Total Film and SFX sections online.
