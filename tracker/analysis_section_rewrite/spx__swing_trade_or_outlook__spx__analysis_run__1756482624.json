      "feedback": "The draft meets the 4‑line mover‑scenario requirement but the Swing‑Trade line is malformed and lacks proper citations and canonical‑handle linkage.  \n**Fixes**:  \n1. **Add citations** to every factual claim in the Up/Down lines (e.g., append “(VDO8D9T7M)” after the driver mechanism and “(VDO8D9T7M)” after the watch list).  \n2. **Separate the trade line** from the scenario lines and format it exactly as:  \n   `Up | 3‑6 mo | 4,200 | 4,100 | 4,300 | 1:1 | tariff escalation >15% or dovish Fed cut (VDO8D9T7M) | GDP revision +3.3% q/q + falling jobless claims (VDO8D9T7M) | 60% | 70`.  \n   (Use “spx” implicitly via the driver mechanism if you wish to emphasize the asset, but it is not required by the format.)  \n3. **Ensure the driver mechanism in the trade line is the trigger** (GDP revision +3.3% q/q + falling jobless claims) and the invalidation is the tariff/Fed‑cut scenario.  \n4. **Remove the extraneous “4,200 (VDO8D9T7M) | 4,150 …” segment** that currently violates the 10‑field rule.  \n5. **Verify that all numbers come from the cited IDs** (e.g., 4,200–4,300 range, 60% probability, 70 confidence).  \nAfter these edits, the output will be a clean, actionable swing‑trade plan that satisfies the canonical‑handle mapping, catalyst window, and probability‑based structure.",
