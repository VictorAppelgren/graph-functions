  "description": "Our Pick Of The Best Private Health Insurance In The UK 2024",
  "content": "Private health insurance can be expensive, particularly for older people, but there are alternatives if you still want to access private medical services and care.\n\nPick and mix style health insurance: some private medical insurance policies allow you to exclude some parts of the cover, or exclude certain conditions and illnesses for example, as a way of cutting the premium cost.\n\nFor example, some policies won\u2019t include cancer cover, as a way of reducing costs. If you want private medical insurance but you\u2019re on a tight budget, speak to an insurance broker, such as LifeSearch, who can help tailor a policy to your needs and bank balance.\n\nSelf pay: you don\u2019t have to have a private medical insurance policy to use private hospitals and private healthcare. You can self-fund any treatment, provided you can pay the bills in full. Three in 10 (31%) private hospital admissions in 2023 were under self-paying arrangements, according to the PHIN (with the rest using private health insurance to pay for care).\n\nSelf-paying for private health treatment can be extremely costly, depending on the tests, surgery or care you need. If you have the spare funds you could put some savings into a cash account, which would then be available should you need to fund private healthcare in future. But the risk is you don\u2019t know how much money you might need for this and any savings could soon be eroded by private medical bills.\n\nHealth cashplans: this is not a form of private health insurance, but more a way of helping towards the cost of routine dental and optical check ups and treatment, among other things. It is a budget option, with premiums starting from around \u00a310 a month, for example, depending on your circumstances.\n\nYou\u2019ll then be able to claim a percentage back (typically around 50% up to a maximum cash limit per year) of the cost of your private or NHS dental check ups and treatment, dental hygienist bills, eye tests, glasses and contact lenses. Some cashplans also provide money towards the cost of physiotherapy. chiropody and osteopathy sessions.\n\n\u201cPrivate health insurance can offer valuable peace of mind that you\u2019ll be able to access the diagnosis and treatment you need at the time you need it, without a long wait or high cost. But with a complex array of policies on the market and premiums ranging widely, it can pay to compare the options available\u201d\n\n Kevin Pratt, editor, Forbes Advisor",
