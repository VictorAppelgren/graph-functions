      "summary": "An Indian immigrant truck driver, Harjinder Singh, caused a fatal crash in Florida on Aug. 12 after making a rogue U‑turn, killing three Haitian immigrants. Despite failing English proficiency and road‑sign tests, Singh had obtained commercial driver licenses in California and Washington, states that allow non‑English testing. The incident highlights gaps in driver‑licensing enforcement and has prompted federal scrutiny of state licensing practices.",
