      "feedback": "Your draft captures the inflation‑driven narrative but falls short of a world‑class synthesis. Tighten the causal chain by explicitly linking the July CPI spike to Fed policy expectations (e.g., projected 25‑bp hikes in Q4 2025) and to sector‑specific valuation shifts (e.g., tech P/E compression of 10‑15% vs. utilities 5‑7%). Replace generic “tightening of risk premia” with concrete metrics such as the 10‑year Treasury‑yield spread widening from 140 bp to 170 bp, and quantify the expected impact on the S&P 500 (e.g., a 0.5‑1.0% drag per 10 bp rise). Expand the macro section to include real GDP growth forecasts (e.g., 1.8% vs. 2.3% last year) and commodity price trends (e.g., WTI crude +5% YoY). Add a policy sub‑section that cites the Fed’s latest minutes (e.g., “Fed signals a 25‑bp hike in September”) and the Fed’s inflation target (2%). For flows/positioning, incorporate recent ETF net inflows/outflows (e.g., “S&P 500 ETFs net outflow of $3 bn in July”) and short‑interest data. In valuation/technicals, include the S&P 500’s current P/E relative to the 10‑yr average (e.g., 18.5 vs. 22) and the 200‑day moving‑average trend. Build a concise watch‑list: (1) CPI revisions (mid‑August), (2) Fed policy minutes (Sept 12), (3) 10‑yr Treasury yield (target 3.5%), (4) tech vs. utilities P/E spread. Cite each point with a distinct source ID (e.g., V7GV8YBQU, FRED‑CPI, FED‑MINUTES). Finally, reconcile any conflicting data (e.g., if the CPI spike is offset by a drop in core services inflation) and note the view’s fragility (e.g., “if core services inflation falls below 2.5% by Q3, the upside bias may reverse”). This will elevate depth, clarity, and actionable insight.",
