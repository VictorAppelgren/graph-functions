      "title": "Trump, en route to Alaska, hints at tougher line with Putin on Ukraine",
      "summary": "President Trump is flying to Alaska to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin at Elmendorf Air Force Base, hoping to pressure Moscow into a ceasefire and discuss land swaps in Ukraine, while also signalling a tougher stance than earlier. The meeting follows a series of diplomatic moves, including Trump’s recent shift in tone toward Putin and European warnings that a unilateral deal could sideline Kyiv. Meanwhile, California has issued IOUs to cover budget shortfalls, prompting criticism from banks and officials, and the state is also fighting a lawsuit over new federal restrictions on undocumented immigrants’ access to public benefits. Additionally, ICE has reversed an expedited removal order for a long‑time resident, highlighting concerns over the administration’s use of expedited removal for non‑citizens.",
