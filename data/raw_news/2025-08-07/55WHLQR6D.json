  "title": "Emma Raducanu has earned surprising amount of money ahead of US Open",
  "description": "Emma Raducanu has climbed up the world rankings ahead of the US Open, but despite her rise in 2025, she hasn't earned as much as you might think.",
  "content": "Emma Raducanu has surprisingly made very little money in tennis this season, despite having a relative amount of success on the courts. The British No. 1 is currently gearing up for the final Grand Slam of the season in the States, as the US Open kicks off on August 24 in New York City. Raducanu has yet to make a final in 2025, with her best result at a major tournament coming at Wimbledon, where she was knocked out in the third round by world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka. The 22-year-old also made it to the third round at the Australian Open and the second round at Roland-Garros, being beaten by 2025 Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek on both occasions. As a result of these early exits, Raducanu has made around \u00a3724,000 ($970K) while playing tennis this year, which is more than a quarter of a million shy of a seven-figure sum.\n\nRaducanu won't be bothering about her earnings right now though, as she is aiming to climb the world rankings at the Cincinatti Open in time for the US Open. Currently, the young tennis star is ranked 33rd in the world and is just one place away from being seeded in the next Grand Slam - something which would benefit her potential long run at the tournament greatly. The US Open was the major tournament that Raducanu triumphed at back in 2021, winning the coveted trophy at just 19 years old. With a 6-4, 6-3 victory, the young tennis star became the first woman to win a singles title without dropping a set since Serena Williams in 2014, and cemented her place in British sporting history with the victory. However, she hasn't won a Grand Slam since, and Raducanu will be hoping that she can relive her former glory at Flushing Meadows by making it to her first final in 2025.\n\nShould she surprise the world and win the trophy again, Raducanu would see her earnings rocket as well as her confidence, after winning \u00a31.8million ($2.5m) in 2021. In this year's tournament, the winner of the women's singles title will pocket a hefty \u00a33.9m ($5m) - as per the Mail - which is a serious jump from the Brit's triumph four years ago. Raducanu will work alongside Rafael Nadal's former coach, Francisco Roig. She aims to rely on the Spaniard's impressive resume to get her to the final she has dreamed of since 2021. To be the first to receive the latest tennis news, join our WhatsApp community or tennis newsletter This change in coaching set-up comes after Mark Petchey returned to his media duties for the US hardcourt season, and it seems to be just a temporary switch for now. Regardless, the UK will be rallying behind Raducanu as she aims to serve up yet another impressive showing in New York City, with the biggest cheque of her young career potentially waiting for her at the end of it all.",

      "text": "Revealed: Record-breaking amount Emma Raducanu will bank if she regains her US Open title - with prize money having more than doubled since Brit's famous triumph in 2021\nEmma Raducanu stands to earn a staggering $5million (\u00a33.9m) if she lifts the US Open trophy for a second time next month \u2013 more than double the amount she pocketed during her fairytale run four years ago.\nThe 22-year-old stunned the tennis world in 2021 by winning in New York as a qualifier, scooping $2.5m (\u00a31.8m) in prize money in one of the sport's most remarkable breakthroughs.\nNow, with the prize pot having ballooned to record levels, tournament organisers have confirmed that this year's men's and women's singles champions will each receive $5m \u2013 the richest individual payday in Grand Slam history.\nThe total player compensation package for the 2025 US Open has also hit an all-time high of $90m (\u00a370m), up from $75m in 2024 and dwarfing the figure from Raducanu's winning year.\nThat dramatic rise comes amid mounting pressure from top players for improved pay distribution across the tour. First-round losers in the main draw will now receive $110,000, while the champions in the men's, women's and mixed doubles events will each share $1m per title.\nRaducanu, Britain's top-ranked female player, is preparing for her return to Flushing Meadows with a new \u2013 and familiar \u2013 face in her corner. Earlier this week, Mail Sport revealed that she has appointed Rafael Nadal's long-time coaching ally Francisco Roig to guide her through the US hard court swing.\nEmma Raducanu earned $2.5million in prize money when she won the US Open in 2021\nRaducanu will bank a staggering $5m is she regains her title at Flushing Meadows this year\nJannik Sinner earned $3.6m in New York last year by winning the US Open men's singles title\nRoig served as a long-time member of Nadal's coaching team, working alongside Toni Nadal and later Carlos Moya during many of the Spaniard's 22 Grand Slam wins, before going on to work with Matteo Berrettini.\nHis arrival marks Raducanu's eighth coaching partnership since turning professional.\nDiscussions between the pair began during Wimbledon, and Roig is now in Cincinnati to help her prepare for the final WTA 1000 event before the last major of the year.\nAfter a stop-start few seasons plagued by injuries and instability, Raducanu will hope that a steady partnership with the experienced Spaniard \u2013 combined with a healthy run of form \u2013 can set the stage for another deep Grand Slam push.\nShould she go all the way again in New York, it won't just be silverware waiting at the end \u2013 it'll be the biggest cheque of her career."
