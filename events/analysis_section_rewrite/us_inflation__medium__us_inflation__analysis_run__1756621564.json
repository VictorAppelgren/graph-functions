      "feedback": "The draft is already focused on DXY and meets the 3–6‑month horizon, catalyst (July CPI), magnitude (0.3–0.5 % rise), and invalidation list. However, to tighten it to Argos standards, add an inline citation to every factual claim (e.g., the 88 % probability of a 25 bp September cut, the 63 % October probability, and the 100 % semiconductor tariff) and explicitly link each causal step to the handle “dxy” (e.g., “Fed Governor Bowman’s endorsement of cuts → lower rates → stronger dxy”). Also, quantify the “dovish Fed signals” with the exact rate‑cut count (three cuts) and the “tariff‑driven risk‑off” with the specific tariff percentages (100 % semis, 50 % India). Finally, ensure the watch signals list includes the exact dates (e.g., CPI release on 2025‑09‑10) and that each invalidation is tied to a measurable event (e.g., a Fed surprise hike >25 bp). With these edits, the analysis will satisfy the truth‑over‑verbosity, handle‑mapping, and catalyst‑window requirements.",
