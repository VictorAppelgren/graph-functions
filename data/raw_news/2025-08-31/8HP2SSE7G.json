  "title": "American Eagle Scores Win With Travis Kelce Collaboration, Timed Perfectly To Swift Proposal",
  "description": "American Eagle launched a collaboration with Travis Kelce's Tru Kolors streetwear, capitalizing on his heightened popularity and timed to his Taylor Swift proposal.",
  "content": "In fashion as in football, timing is everything and American Eagle Outfitters has just made a play timed perfectly to put more points on the scoreboard for the brand. Just a day after Travis Kelce\u2019s internet-breaking proposal to Taylor Swift, it launched a limited edition collaboration with Travis Kelce\u2019s Tru Kolors streetwear fashion brand, headlined by an array of sports stars under the banner \u201cLive to Play.\u201d\n\nThe launch comes at a time when Kelce\u2019s cultural capital is at an all-time high \u2013 he is the Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 top scorer in endorsement deals, with the team\u2019s sponsorship revenue up 59% since 2021, according to SponsorUnited.\n\nAnd it follows the \u201cSydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans\u201d campaign that went viral after controversy erupted around the ad\u2019s tongue-in-cheek play on genes/jeans, causing some to claim AEO was promoting the superiority of white beauty.\n\nThis time AEO is playing it safe with Kelce recruiting a multi-ethnic team of players to support the launch, including tennis star Anna Frey, basketball players Azzi Fudd and Kiyan Anthony, quarterback Drew Allar, wide receiver Jeremiah Smith and elite gymnast Suni Lee.\n\n\u201cAmerican Eagle and Travis Kelce were destined to collaborate,\u201d AEO president Jennifer Foyle said in a statement. \u201cAn iconic brand teaming up with one of the greatest athletes of our generation \u2013 that\u2019s what I call a win.\u201d\n\nAccording to the company, the AE x TK collaboration was a year in the works. From the collection\u2019s design, fabrication, color palette to graphic presentation, Kelce was fully hands-on, acting as the creative director.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to keep my excitement about this collab under wraps for nearly a year,\u201d Kelce said. However, that it dropped the day after his much-publicized marriage proposal to Taylor Swift surely is no coincidence.\n\nAnd the timing works well for AEO after the furor over the Sweeney ad. \u201cStrategically, pivoting to Travis Kelce provides the brand with a new upbeat narrative that moves the conversation away from past criticism,\u201d shared Lynn Carratt, E20 Communications, with Newsweek.\n\nWith Kelce sharing the campaign\u2019s spotlight with a diverse group of athletes, executive vice president of PR at Mod Op Chris Harihar added, \u201cUltimately, the way they executed it was smart because it reinforces the perception that American Eagle values inclusivity as a brand. The goal here is to rebuild trust with a wider audience.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t Kelce\u2019s first play in the fashion arena. In 2019, he founded the fashion brand Tru Kolors \u2013the name inspired by his initials. It is described as a lifestyle brand that \u201cfuses varsity nostalgia with leisure luxury, capturing the spirit of sport, social connection, and expressive style. Designed for those who lead with confidence and live to play.\u201d\n\nSomething For Everyone\n\nThe first introduction of the AE x Tru Kolors by Travis Kelce collection dropped on August 27, with a second installment scheduled for September 24. The collection will total more than 90 pieces, including tees, varsity jackets, cricket sweaters, rugby polos, utility cargos and cashmere sets, priced between $14.95 and $179.95.\n\nThe campaign will be supported across social media, cable TV placements, out-of-home advertisements across the Chief\u2019s hometown of Kansas City, a partnership with the NFL\u2019s The Ringer podcast and takeovers within fantasy sports content.\n\n\u201cI started Tru Kolors on the foundation of showing up authentically and having fun with style, and we wanted this collab to reflect that same energy,\u201d Kelce stated. \u201cI want everyone to feel there is something for them in the collection, something they can feel good in and make their own.\u201d\n\nWhile AEO might have been caught flatfooted by the controversy surrounding the Sweeney \u201cGreat Jeans\u201d ad, it is putting a positive spin on the \u201cLive to Play\u201d one with Kelce and team taking the lead.\n\n\u201cAE and Tru Kolors are rooted in optimism, self-expression and confidence \u2013 and we share a passion for empowering everyone to feel like their true self when wearing our products,\u201d AEO\u2019s Foyle concluded.\n\nNote: AEO will report second quarter earnings on Wednesday, Sept. 3 after market close. The controversial Sweeney ad broke on July 23 and since then, AEO stocks have risen from under $11 to close this past Friday around $13.",

The Eagles have also continued to spread their wings on the partnership front, adding 11 brands to their long list of partnerships YoY.\nIn terms of number of deals, the Eagles have 117 sponsorships, surpassing the Chiefs\u2019 88. Meanwhile, the Bills and Commanders\u2014AFC and NFC Championship runners-up, respectively\u2014each partnered with more than 100 brands this season. The impressive breadth of partnerships stems in part from leveraging league-level deals, third-party agency signings, and sub-brand activations that expand these teams\u2019 overall portfolios.\nMid-level rotating billboards rank as the Eagles\u2019 most popular asset, while the Chiefs\u2019 top seller is the 360 rotating ribbon board\u2014highlighting both teams\u2019 focus on maximizing in-stadium visibility for its brand partners.\nWhen it comes to endorsements, Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes are tied for the #1 spot on the Chiefs with 14 deals each\u2013\u2013including Lowe\u2019s, Subway, and Pepsi for Kelce and adidas, State Farm, and Coors Light for Mahomes\u2014while Saquon Barkley ranks as the most-endorsed Eagle, counting Nike, Ally Financial, and Unisom among his 12 partnerships. The standalone star power of these athletes adds value to each team\u2019s broader sponsorship narrative, attracting brands eager to align with the household names. Both franchises are also growing their influence on social media: the Eagles saw an 8% follower increase YoY, while the Chiefs trailed closely behind with a 7% gain."

      "text": "Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2018s post on Instagram announcing their engagement got a lot of, well, engagement.\nAccording to data shared with Billboard on Wednesday (Aug. 27), Meta counts that the photos of the Kansas City Chiefs tight end proposing to the pop star have surpassed 1 million reposts on Instagram \u2014 more than any other post has ever received on the platform. Even more impressive, the couple\u2019s announcement achieved that record in just six hours.\nThe news comes after Billboard previously reported that the post had earned 14 million \u201clikes\u201d in just one hour. At press time, Instagram displays that it has surged past 29 million.\nIf there was ever going to be a post that would garner such high stats, it\u2019s Swift and Kelce\u2019s. The duo\u2019s big reveal \u2014 which they shared by writing, \u201cYour English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married\u201d \u2014 sent the internet into an absolute frenzy, with fans flooding social media with messages of shock and congratulations. Even President Donald Trump got in on the action, setting aside his grievances with the 14-time Grammy winner to say during a cabinet meeting, \u201cI think he\u2019s a great guy, and she\u2019s a terrific person, so I wish them a lot of luck.\u201d\nTrending on Billboard\nThe engagement comes after about two years of dating for Swift and the athlete, who popped the question two weeks prior to their Tuesday (Aug. 26) announcement, according to Kelce\u2019s dad, Ed. The lovebirds now have wedding planning to add to their busy schedules, which features the beginning of the Chiefs\u2019 football season on Sept. 5 and the release of the musician\u2019s new album, The Life of a Showgirl, on Oct. 3."

      "text": "This summer, everybody is talking about jeans, specifically American Eagle jeans. Its \u201cSydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans\u201d campaign, featuring the Euphoria and The White Lotus star that broke on July 23, has sparked outrage from many by playing off the sound-alike words \u201cgenes\u201d and \u201cjeans\u201d and garnered raves from others who delight in their outrage.\nAt the outset, American Eagle bet big on its tie-up with Sweeney. CMO Craig Brommers told Marketing Dive it represents the brand\u2019s largest advertising investment ever and that he expected it to pay off during the back-to-school season, which he described as the \u201cSuper Bowl\u201d for jeans sales.\nThe fact that the ad campaign has gone viral means that American Eagle Outfitters stands to reap exponentially greater returns than it originally invested and over a longer period of time than just the BTS season. It needs the boost after first quarter revenues were down 5% to $1.1 billion, and it ended last year with only 1% growth to $5.3 billion.\nJennifer Foyle, president and executive creative director of AEO\u2019s American Eagle and Aerie brands, said in a statement that American Eagle sets the trend in denim \u201cthat leads, never follows.\u201d In trendsetter fashion, American Eagle is going against the current cultural norms by returning to advertising designed to sell, rather than promote a targeted agenda.\nBacklash\nSweeney, who is a buxom, blue-eyed blonde, faced backlash from a video where she said, \u201cGenes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color\u2026My jeans are blue.\u201d\nAccording to reports, that video was removed from American Eagle\u2019s social channels.\nBut the damage was done and the online firestorm continues with other ads featuring the tagline\u2019s pun, \u201cSydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans.\u201d Cries erupted of Sweeney and American Eagle promoting Nazi-era \u201cAryan race\u201d eugenics with its implied message of white beauty\u2019s superiority. CNN called it a \u201cwhite-supremist dog whistle.\u201d\nColumbia University\u2019s Dr. Sayantani DasGupta took to TikTok saying, \u201cIt is both a testament to this political moment, and its contributing to and reinforcing this kind of anti-immigrant, anti-people of color, pro-eugenic political moment.\u201d That post has garnered over three million views.\nThere was pushback against the campaign\u2019s overtly sexual tone \u2013 harking back to the controversial Cindy Crawford\u2019s white-tank-top and short-shorts Pepsi commercial that ran in the 1992 Super Bowl and the campaign Brooke Shields did with Calvin Klein in the 1980s. The latter was deserved, as Shields was an underage 15 years old at the time, but Sweeney is a 27-year-old adult woman.\nRight-Wing Political Figures Push Back Against The Backlash\nPeople on the other side of the cultural divide find the ad clever, even getting a kick from the outrage spawned by the campaign. Conservative bloggers, like Megyn Kelly and Benny Johnson, are making the most of the controversy, and right-leaning Fox News mentioned Sweeney and American Eagle 62 times in the week after it launched, according to Media Matters.\nTo put the other side\u2019s noses further out of joint, MAGA voices have weighed in, including Sen. Ted Cruz, Vice President J.D. Vance and President Trump.\n\u201cSydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the \u2018HOTTEST\u2019 ad out there. It\u2019s for American Eagle, and the jeans are \u2018flying off the shelves,\u2019\u201d the President said on Truth Social, adding, \u201cThe tide has seriously turned \u2014 Being WOKE is for losers.\u201d\nWhile Modern Retail reports that American Eagle may be working with a crisis PR firm to counter the backlash, and it did an Instagram post featuring a woman of color stating, \u201cAE Has Great Jeans,\u201d the company remains unapologetic, saying in a statement posted on Instagram:\n\u201c\u2018Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans\u2019 is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story. We\u2019ll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way. Great jeans look good on everyone.\u201d\nCultural Reckoning Or Cultural Shift?\nThe Collage Group research firm, specializing in cultural intelligence insights, reports that even before the campaign broke, American Eagle had been a laggard in aligning with America\u2019s increasingly diverse consumer base.\n\u201cThe backlash against American Eagle\u2019s recent campaign isn\u2019t surprising when you look at the brand\u2019s cultural fluency,\u201d said Jack Mackinnon, Collage\u2019s director of cultural insights, citing lower than average scores on several of the six dimensions that make up its Brand Cultural Fluency Quotient.\n\u201cWhen a brand is already underperforming in cultural relevance, missteps in advertising are amplified, because there\u2019s less brand equity to fall back on. Our data shows that culturally fluent brands win in the marketplace,\u201d he continued.\nYet when brands read the cultural signals wrong or push too hard to promote what they perceive as a culturally-progressive agenda, they may pay a heavy price. Think of Bud Light and Dylan Mulvaney, Target\u2019s Pride Month 2023 campaign with its tuck-friendly swimsuit or Jaguar\u2019s confusing rebrand without a car in sight.\nMaster marketer Jennifer Sey, named twice to the Forbes Most Influential CMOs list and who is an expert in many respects on the world of jean advertising from her 23 years with Levi\u2019s, applauds it for returning to marketing fundamentals and \u201cnormie\u201d advertising with the only goal to sell more jeans.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a major about-face after more than a decade of jean, car and beer brands forcing \u2018wokeness\u2019 down our gullets,\u201d she wrote on Substack. \u201cBut at the end of the day, sex sells and pretty girls with sexy stares can sell anything. After years of hocking body positivity, it appears hot-girl summer is the way to go.\u201d\nOn a side note, Sey is the founder of XX-XY Athletics, whose mission is to protect women\u2019s and girl\u2019s sports from the inclusion of transgender athletes, a position with which 80% of Americans agree, though no other athletic brand has publicly taken a position on the controversial issue.\nThe Majority Sides With American Eagle\nAt least half of the country gets the American Eagle message, according to a YouGov poll fielded Aug. 1 among 3,500 adults. Overall, 52% believe the wordplay in the tagline \u201cSydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans\u201d is appropriate, while only 16% think it inappropriate and 32% are undecided.\nInterestingly, the youngest consumers, aged 18 to 29 years old (mostly GenZers and trailing edge Millennials) have the highest share of inappropriates (28%) and lowest share of appropriates (36%).\nHowever, they also have the highest share of uncertains (36%), which isn\u2019t too surprising. Being younger, they are still in the formative stages of building their identity and so more influenced by peer pressure and those they look to as leaders and authority figures.\nOn the other hand, nearly 60% of adults aged 45 and older believe the wordplay is appropriate. And across the political spectrum, even a plurality of Democrats (46%) and Independents (49%) consider it appropriate.\nUltimate Goal To Sell More Jeans\nWhile the YouGov poll found the youngest cohort is still on the fence about the \u201cSydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans\u201d ad campaign, Sourcing Journal reported late last year that American Eagle brand was the number one jeans line among its core target customers aged 15 to 25 years. Once the dust settles, the young undecideds are likely to join the majority or not let their uncertainty about the appropriateness of the wordplay put them off their favorite jeans.\nThe campaign has done something that only great advertisements do: broken through the noise and gotten consumers\u2019 attention. And as fellow Forbes.com contributor Doug Melville points out, that is increasingly hard to do.\nDespite the backlash or even because of it, American Eagle is profiting big-time from the controversy. Its stock is up over 20% since the campaign broke and \u201cThe Sydney Jean\u201d she modeled in the ad has sold out.\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters will report second-quarter earnings toward the end of August, which will only catch a few days of sales after the campaign broke. At that time, it will be up against high comps of $1.3 billion in sales on 8% growth across its American Eagle and Aerie brands, so it won\u2019t be until the third and fourth quarters when the first results come in.\nNew Era Dawning\n\u201cThis was a very strategic effort to do something that pushed the limits, attracted attention and got people to notice the brand,\u201d Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management, told the Wall Street Journal.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite clear that we\u2019re in a new era for advertising. Brands over the past decade have become very careful about being inclusive in their advertising, and I think now clearly that\u2019s changing,\u201d he continued.\nBy boldly challenging perceived contemporary cultural norms, American Eagle is positioned at the forefront of a cultural realignment that is veering away from extremes and returning to the middle.\n\u201cAfter years of brand-destroying body positivity and \u2018inclusive\u2019 marketing, \u2018normies\u2019 took the wheel at American Eagle and their sales and stock price soared. The brand is back and relying on the formula as old as advertising itself: hotness,\u201d Sey wrote.\n\u201cBrands can further normal ideas to normal people and not feel bad about it anymore. I suspect brands that have been chasing social justice through advertising, which only served to tank sales, are relieved as well,\u201d she concluded.\nSee also:"

Check out our full conversation here!\nCheers!\nMaggie McGrath\nFeatured Forbes Analysis: Here\u2019s How Much Taylor Swift And Travis Kelce Are Worth\nTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce have officially entered their Engagement Era. On Tuesday, the billionaire pop star and the Kansas City Chiefs tight end released a joint Instagram post with photographs of their enchanted garden proposal. \u201cYour English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married,\u201d the couple, who began dating in 2023, wrote. Of course, the couple won\u2019t exactly be building their new life together on teachers\u2019 salaries. The world\u2019s richest female musician, Swift is worth an estimated $1.6 billion. While Kelce could afford to buy her a diamond engagement ring worth an estimated $650,000, his fortune is nowhere close to hers. Forbes estimates the three-time Super Bowl champion is worth $70 million. What does this mean for their combined assets? Read on\u2014or watch this interview with Forbes executive editor Luisa Kroll\u2014to find out.\nICYMI: News Of The Week\nFederal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook sued President Donald Trump in federal court on Thursday, court records show, launching what\u2019s expected to be a significant court battle to determine to what extent the president can exert control over the nation\u2019s central bank. This comes after Trump said Monday night he was firing Cook, citing alleged issues with her mortgage agreements. Cook has protested her firing and refused to leave the Federal Reserve, however, arguing Trump does not have the legal authority to fire her.\nIn spite of c-suite executives like Sruthi Lanka who are embracing AI tools to advance their companies\u2019 bottom lines, researchers from Hong Kong Polytechnic University and Peking University have found that AI usage can exacerbate gender biases in the workplace. Specifically, these researchers found that when women and men both use AI to produce identical work products, the women are viewed as less competent than the men.\nWorking mothers are leaving their jobs at the fastest pace we\u2019ve seen since the pandemic began in 2020. Economist Misty Heggeness joined ForbesWomen editor Maggie McGrath for a Forbes Newsroom segment on this labor market trend, and she explained why the nearly three-percent decline in mothers\u2019 labor force participation could be a canary in the coal mine for the broader economy.\nEarlier this summer, actor Kristen Bell received the first two Emmy Award nominations of her illustrious career (Ed. note: recognition that is LONG overdue for the person who portrayed Veronica Mars and Eleanor Shellstrop), for her work on Netflix comedy series Nobody Wants This. Bell sat down with Forbes contributor Jeff Conway to talk about her work on the show\u2014which includes acting and executive producing\u2014and why she has a policy of only working in Los Angeles.\nThe Checklist\n1. Get a new hobby. It may sound trivial, but having real hobbies may be one of the smartest career investments you can make. Hobbies can spark creativity, build resilience and fuel professional growth. They also boost happiness\u2014a proven driver of success in both business and education.\n2. Manage ambient stress. Ambient stress is the low-level, chronic tension running in the background of your mind\u2014and if it runs unattended for too long, it can affect your health. Here\u2019s how to reduce its impact.\n3. Expand your \u201cinspiration network.\u201d In turbulent times, reaching out to great, supportive mentors, colleagues, and professionals in your own field and adjacent ones brings fresh energy and insight. It's not about transactional or opportunistic networking\u2014it\u2019s about tapping into community, mutually-beneficial support, and shared wisdom.\nThe Quiz\nLess than two months after her confirmation in July, the White House fired CDC Director Susan Monarez on Wednesday. The move prompted resignations by at least three top CDC officials, following earlier firings of hundreds of employees and a shooting at the Atlanta headquarters of the key public health agency. What reportedly drove Monarez\u2019 firing?\n- Allegations that she committed mortgage fraud\n- Disagreement with RFK Jr. over vaccine policy\n- Her refusal to share vaccination information with ICE\n- Lack of alignment on funding for mRNA research"

Inconsistencies may occur.\nAmerican Eagle is back in the spotlight\u2014and this time for more positive reasons\u2014thanks to America's favorite \"gym teacher,\" Travis Kelce.\nThe Kansas City Chiefs star is fronting the denim brand's latest campaign with the message: \"live to play,\" through his lifestyle label, Tru Kolors.\nThe collaboration was announced on Instagram just a day after the news of Kelce's engagement to Taylor Swift broke the internet.\nBut the timing is also significant for the clothing brand. The launch comes only weeks after the company faced backlash over its \"Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans\" campaign with the Euphoria actor, which drew criticism for perceived racial undertones linked to eugenics.\nHere, Newsweek explores how American Eagle is navigating its comeback with Kelce, what PR experts say about the brand's strategy to include more diversity \u2014 and the mixed reaction the campaign has sparked online.\nThe PR Take\n\"Without the Sydney controversy, we might have seen more shots centered just on him in this reveal,\" Chris Harihar, Executive Vice President of PR at Mod Op, told Newsweek. \"Ultimately, the way they executed it is smart because it reinforces the perception that American Eagle values inclusivity as a brand. The goal here is to rebuild trust with a wider audience.\"\nInside the Campaign\nAmerican Eagle reported that the AE x Tru Kolors by Travis Kelce collection, that dropped yesterday, has been more than a year in the making, with Kelce serving as Creative Director.\nThe line, priced between $14.95 and $179.95, includes vintage-inspired tees, varsity jackets, utility cargos and cashmere sets.\nTo reinforce its \"live to play\" ethos, the campaign also spotlights a diverse group of athletes including gymnast Suni Lee and basketball guard Azzi Fudd, underscoring inclusivity alongside Kelce's star power.\nWhy Kelce, Why Now?\nHarihar further explained to Newsweek why the partnership was a strategic choice.\nHe noted that Kelce's personal brand has skyrocketed in recent years, pointing to data from Sponsor United showing the Chiefs' sponsorship revenue has jumped nearly 60%\u2014a rise tied not just to team success, but to Kelce's crossover star power.\n\"A major driver of that is his relationship with Taylor Swift, I think he would even admit this, which has turned him into a cultural phenomenon beyond football, see his cameo in Happy Gilmore.\n\"Their engagement, which broke the internet, only adds to the momentum, really cementing him as one of the more valuable partners a brand could have,\" he said.\nHe added that American Eagle needed a broadly appealing figure after the Sweeney controversy, and Kelce fit the bill.\n\"They took a hit from the polarizing reaction to that campaign, as well as from competitor campaigns that felt like 'responses', like Gap's viral Katseye ad,\" he continued.\nAmid the backlash against American Eagle's Sydney Sweeney campaign, Gap introduced its \"Better in Denim\" ad on August 19\u2014which quickly went viral and was met with praise for featuring multicultural pop girl group Katseye dancing joyfully in Y2K-inspired denim to Kelis's \"Milkshake.\"\n\"That made it important for American Eagle to return with someone who had safe, broad appeal. The fact that Travis could step into that role and still generate mostly a positive response speaks to his value,\" Harihar said.\nBut he also pointed out the importance of how the campaign was executed, if they had solely focused on Kelce \u2013 a white, male athlete \u2013 they could have opened the doors to further criticism.\n\"The campaign leans into diversity and representation, likely built in from the start given the other athletes involved. However, the launch creative also feels intentionally less 'all Travis' and more group-focused,\" he said.\nThe Online Debate\nDespite this strategy, the launch hasn't escaped criticism.\n\"Ok but Travis Kelce partnering with American Eagle is incredibly tone deaf,\" wrote Christine Garcia (@xtinealicia) on Threads, in a post that racked up more than 34,000 views.\nOthers defended Kelce and the collaboration. Jordan (@puffer112) argued: \"This opinion may be a little controversial, but I don't understand the hate that Travis Kelce is getting for the American Eagle partnership.\n\"I understand that their last campaign was awful. But it's not like collaborations happen overnight. This stuff takes months and months to do. And unfortunately, he doesn't have a crystal ball that will tell him that American Eagle will get into a scandal involving white supremacy.\"\nA Fresh Narrative\nLynn Carratt, PR and Entertainment Expert at E20 Communications, agreed that Kelce's appeal goes far beyond football.\n\"By pairing Travis with a campaign that emphasizes diversity and connection, American Eagle are broadening their appeal beyond just Gen Z shoppers. They are trying to position themselves, not just as a denim brand, but as a lifestyle label,\" she told Newsweek.\nCarratt said the timing of the launch was also no accident following the international buzz of Kelce's engagement to Swift, allowing American Eagle to reframe its public image with a celebratory and inclusive campaign.\n\"Strategically, pivoting to Travis Kelce provides the brand with a new upbeat narrative that moves the conversation away from past criticism,\" she said.\nWith the second half of the collection set to drop on September 24, time will soon tell if the Kelce collaboration delivers a recuperative touchdown for American Eagle.\nNewsweek reached out to American Eagle Outfitter's press office and to Travis Kelce's publicist for comment via email.\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nAbout the writer\nLydia Patrick is a Newsweek Life and Trends Reporter based in London, focusing on emerging trends, human interest stories, and ...
