      "feedback": "The draft conflates multiple assets (USD, Treasury, S&P 500) and mixes “Up” and “Down” signals without a clear causal chain; each line must map to a single canonical handle with explicit sign, magnitude, and a dated catalyst. Replace the generic “Fed cut not occurring” and “Fed cut probability” entries with a single, coherent view on the UST 10‑year yield: “Down | Sep 2025 | Fed rate cut probability (XTQIQRP5K) | September FOMC decision (U21K4ALYQ) and August PCE (97MD1FHW8) | 88%” and “Up | Sep 2025 | Fed rate cut not occurring | September FOMC decision (U21K4ALYQ) and August PCE (97MD1FHW8) | 12%.” Drop the tariff‑risk items because they lack a direct handle mapping to a primary asset and are too speculative; instead, add a single “Down | Sep 2025 | Import‑price inflation rise (3952FOSRQ) | Tariff policy announcement (3952FOSRQ) and CPI (FAN5RYW6T) | 30%.” Ensure each line cites the source ID in parentheses immediately after the driver, uses a single sentence, and includes a concrete probability. Remove any references to the S&P 500 or other indices, as the focus is on UST 10‑year yield. This yields exactly four items, each meeting the handle‑mapping, catalyst‑window, and probability requirements.",
