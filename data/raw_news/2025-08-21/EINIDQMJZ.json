  "description": "Latest F/A-18 Super Hornet crash off Virginia adds to string of recent Navy mishaps as pilot survives water landing during routine training exercise.",
  "content": "A Navy pilot was rescued from the waters off Virginia on Wednesday after an F/A-18 Super Hornet went down during a routine training flight.The crash happened around 10 a.m. ET, according to Lt. Jackie Parashar, a spokesperson for Naval Air Force Atlantic. The pilot, assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 83 in Virginia Beach, was found by search and rescue crews at 11:21 a.m. and taken to a local hospital. The jet remains in the water as the Navy investigates the cause.Once the investigation is complete, the Navy will decide whether to order a safety stand-down \u2014 a pause in operations to focus on safety training and risk reduction.The incident is the latest in a string of F/A-18 mishaps. In May, a Super Hornet slid into the Red Sea after failing to land on the USS Harry S. Truman. Both pilots ejected safely. A week earlier, another jet rolled off the Truman\u2019s deck during a towing operation.NAVY CONFIRMS F-35 FIGHTER JET WENT DOWN NEAR CALIFORNIA BASE, PILOT SAFELY EJECTEDIn December, a Super Hornet from the \"Red Rippers\" of Strike Fighter Squadron 11 at Naval Air Station Oceana was shot down in a friendly fire incident over the Red Sea.Each F/A-18 costs about $67 million, according to Naval Air Systems Command.One former senior defense official told Fox News Digital that the recent mishaps \"deserve to be examined \u2014 especially in light of all the other extreme challenges the Navy is facing.\" The official added: \"It\u2019s interesting to me that the F-35 and V-22 receive extensive scrutiny from the press when a mishap occurs, yet the rates of those aircraft stand up well compared to the Navy\u2019s Super Hornets, which somehow get a pass.\"MILITARY JET'S MYSTERIOUS COLLISION RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT ADVANCED UFOS IN US AIRSPACE: 'BEEN HERE ALL ALONG'Another source familiar with Navy procurement said the recent accidents were not unexpected, which was one reason the service agreed to buy 17 more Super Hornets in 2024.Since fiscal year 2015, the F/A-18 and its variants (F/A-18E, F/A-18F, and EA-18G) have been involved in 42 Class A flight mishaps \u2014 the most serious category, covering accidents that result in death, a destroyed aircraft, or more than $2.5 million in damage. That averages out to about 4.2 Class A mishaps a year, or 2.18 per 100,000 flight hours, according to data provided to Fox News Digital by Naval Safety Command.Across all manned Navy aircraft, the average Class A mishap rate was 2.29 per 100,000 flight hours.In 2023 and 2024, the Navy recorded seven Class A flight mishaps each year. As of August 2025, there have been seven Class A flight mishaps, three involving F/A-18s.The F/A-18 fleet has also experienced 82 Class B mishaps \u2014 accidents involving permanent partial disability, the hospitalization of three or more crew, or $600,000 to $2.5 million in damage \u2014 and 307 Class C mishaps, which involve injuries resulting in missed work or $60,000 to $600,000 in aircraft damage, over the past decade.",

      "text": "Declassified documents revealing a United States military aircraft was previously struck by an unknown flying object is raising eyebrows as experts point to other unexplainable sightings suggesting otherworldly technology flying within the country\u2019s airspace.\nThe incident occurred in January 2023, after an unidentified object collided with the left side of an F-16 Viper jet participating in training exercises near Gila Benda, Arizona, an Air Force spokesperson confirmed to Fox News Digital.\nThe flying object struck the clear \"canopy\" at the top of the aircraft and was first spotted by an instructor pilot sitting in the rear of the plane, officials said. An initial investigation determined no damage was done to the near $70 million jet, with officials ruling against a possible bird strike.\nAuthorities ultimately determined the aircraft was struck by a drone, but the location and operator of the device have yet to be determined, the spokesperson said.\nThe incident was the first of four encounters with unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP) that were reported a day later, according to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) documents obtained by the War Zone.\n\"According to military personnel I\u2019ve personally met with, there were objects 200 miles off the East Coast that were extensively loitering and had no visible means of propulsion,\" James Fox, a director specializing in films about UFO activity, told Fox News Digital. \"So a report from 2023 about an actual impact with a UAP doesn\u2019t really surprise me.\"\nSCIENTISTS DISCOVER MYSTERIOUS SPHERE IN COLOMBIA, SPARKING UFO SPECULATION\nThe concerning collision comes as the Department of Defense reported 757 incidents involving UAPs from May 1, 2023, to June 1, 2024, according to an unclassified document released by the All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office.\nOf those encounters, 708 occurred in the air, with only 49 instances marked as \"case closed\" by officials. Additionally, the department received 18 reports regarding UAP incidents near nuclear infrastructure, launch sites and weapons, according to the report.\n\"None of these resolved cases substantiated advanced foreign adversarial capabilities or breakthrough aerospace technologies,\" the report states.\nUFO FOOTAGE CAPTURED BY US NAVY SHOWS MYSTERIOUS AIRCRAFT LAUNCHING FROM SEA, EXPERT SAYS\nThe sightings of UAPs near military sites are nothing new, according to Fox.\n\"There are reports dating back to the 1930s and 1940s,\" Fox said. \"Where you had mysterious, glowing, and orb-like objects that emitted very bright light that could just fly rings around the military planes from World War II.\"\nFox pointed to the sheer advanced technology showcased within these sightings, such as aircraft that do not emit a heat signature or have the ability to fly stationary in high wind conditions.\n\"This has been well-documented for decades,\" Fox said. \"So either we\u2019ve managed to track the same thing it\u2019s been, [possibly] non-human intelligence, since the 1940s. Or someone has managed to replicate the technology, reverse engineer it and they\u2019re flying it around.\"\nVIRAL CIA FILE ABOUT ALIENS ATTACKING SOLDIERS TAKES OFF WITH UFO INTRIGUE\nIn 2020, the Department of Defense established an Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force (UAPTF) to further research and investigate the various UAPs spotted throughout American skies.\n\"The mission of the task force is to detect, analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security,\" the department said in a statement.\nFox also cited officials\u2019 use of updated technology to pinpoint the location and characteristics of UAPs possibly contributing to the influx in reports over recent years.\nUFO COVER USED BY GOVERNMENT TO \u2018HIDE A LOT OF THINGS,\u2019 FORMER NASA AGENT SAYS\n\"They\u2019ve adjusted the frequency on particular radars to pick up smaller objects that maybe have been here all along,\" Fox said, adding, \"it\u2019s a global phenomenon exhibiting the technology that\u2019s just lightyears ahead from anything we have. Has there been a successful effort in reverse engineering? [If not], then it falls into the category that many would say is non-human intelligence.\"\nWhile a vast majority of UAPs spotted by officials are quickly identified, Fox insists there are a select few that have origins unknown to even the highest of government authorities and do not match the technology owned by the country\u2019s adversaries.\n\"A small percentage of these objects display a technology that's just light-years beyond anything that we or anybody else on the planet has,\" Fox said. \"Which would imply, once you do the process of elimination, if it isn\u2019t Russia or China, and if it\u2019s not us, what's left?\"\nSCIENTISTS DISCOVER MYSTERIOUS SPHERE IN COLOMBIA, SPARKING UFO SPECULATION\nFox also attributes overall public skepticism regarding UAPs to the U.S. government remaining tight-lipped about its findings over the years. However, officials have continued to work toward transparency with the American public, with a congressional hearing on UFOs occurring for the first time in decades in 2022 and continuing to take place on the floors of Congress.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"The primary reason for secrecy is that it\u2019s difficult for any governing body to admit that there are structured craft of unknown origin whizzing around with impunity,\" Fox said. \"They fly rings around our fastest jets, and [the government] doesn\u2019t know who they are, where they come from or what they want.\""
