  "description": "With iOS 26, Apple is bringing several new features to the AirPods, making them more useful than before. The added functionality will be available...",
  "content": "With iOS 26, Apple is bringing several new features to the AirPods, making them more useful than before. The added functionality will be available this fall when Apple releases \u200ciOS 26\u200c and updated AirPods firmware, but you can test everything new right now.\n\nThe AirPods can be used as a camera remote for the Camera app or third-party iOS camera apps. You'll need to enable the feature if you want to use it, and you can do so by connecting your AirPods to your iPhone, opening up the AirPods section in the Settings app, and then choosing the Camera Remote option.\n\nOnce the feature is turned on, using it is as simple as popping in your AirPods, opening the camera app, and then pressing and holding on the AirPods stem to take a photo or start a video recording.\n\nWhen you're finished, a second press and hold gesture will stop the recording. If you have an Apple Watch, you can already control your \u200ciPhone\u200c remotely from your wrist, but the AirPods have the potential to be even quicker since it's a one-press physical gesture rather than a series of steps that include opening an Apple Watch app.\n\nThe AirPods 4 and the AirPods Pro 2 now offer recording studio-quality audio for interviews, podcasts, songs, videos, and more. Apple says that the feature can be used to record high-quality vocals while on the go, with background sounds filtered out thanks to Voice Isolation.\n\nYou can record higher-quality audio when making videos or using your devices to do things like record a podcast.\n\nThe H2 chip in the \u200cAirPods 4\u200c and \u200cAirPods Pro\u200c 2 brings more natural vocal texture and clarity to \u200ciPhone\u200c calls, FaceTime calls, and all CallKit-enabled apps like Zoom.\n\nStudio-quality audio recording and improved call quality are available across \u200ciPhone\u200c, iPad, and Mac, and support the Camera app, Voice Memos, Messages dictation, third-party camera apps, and video conferencing apps.\n\nIf you're listening to music, a podcast, or a book while you're in bed and you're wearing AirPods, the AirPods will pause your audio when you fall asleep if you toggle on the new \"Pause Media When Falling Asleep\" option.\n\nYou'll find it in the AirPods settings after connecting your AirPods to your \u200ciPhone\u200c, but you'll need the new AirPods firmware and \u200ciOS 26\u200c. In addition to saving your spot in an audiobook or podcast, it will also preserve battery by turning your AirPods off so they're not running all night.\n\nThis feature also works with Beats earbuds.\n\n\u200ciOS 26\u200c addresses an irritating issue that happens with CarPlay and AirPods. There's a \"Keep Audio in Headphones\" option that prevents audio from switching to car speakers or Bluetooth speakers when you're listening to music through the AirPods.\n\nWith the option on, your music will continue playing in your AirPods when you get in the car. You can turn it on in \u200ciOS 26\u200c by going to Settings > General > AirPlay and Continuity.\n\n\n\nApple improved AirPods charging in \u200ciOS 26\u200c, and the AirPods Charging case will now more clearly indicate charging status. You'll also see reminders when it's time to charge your AirPods so you're less likely to run out of battery.\n\nThere's a green light when the AirPods are fully charged, a pulsing amber light when they're charging, and a darker amber light that lets you know that it's time for a charge because the battery is getting low.\n\nWith \u200ciOS 26\u200c, Apple is adding an option to more easily install beta updates on AirPods. There's a new update interface when you connect your AirPods to your \u200ciPhone\u200c and tap into them in the Settings app.\n\n\n\nHow to Get the New AirPods Features Now\n\nTo try out the new \u200ciOS 26\u200c AirPods features, you'll need to install the \u200ciOS 26\u200c public beta or the \u200ciOS 26\u200c developer beta. The developer beta requires a free developer account, but anyone can sign up for the \u200ciOS 26\u200c public beta.\n\nJust go to Apple's beta website and follow the steps.\n\nOnce you have \u200ciOS 26\u200c installed, you can connect your AirPods and then open up the AirPods section of the Settings app. From there, scroll down to AirPods Beta Updates and toggle on beta firmware.\n\nPut the AirPods in the charging case and put them near your \u200ciPhone\u200c to trigger the beta firmware to be downloaded on the AirPods. Once your AirPods are running the beta firmware, you'll see settings for the new options in the AirPods section of the Settings app.\n\nWe have a dedicated iOS 26 roundup that goes into detail on all of the new features that are available in the update.",

      "text": "iPad\nApple's 11-inch iPad with Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard Folio support, starting at $349.\nShould You Buy an Entry-Level iPad?\nThe iPad is Apple's most affordable and most popular tablet. The 11th-generation model includes an A16 chip, a design with flat sides and a range of color options, an 11-inch display, a USB-C port, and more, with prices that start at $349.\nIntroduced in March 2025, the 11th-generation iPad is at the beginning of its product cycle, which means now is a good time to buy. A new model isn't expected until March 2026 at the earliest.\nThe iPad is Apple's most inexpensive iPad model for those who want a balance of features and affordability, but users looking for a smaller iPad with better specifications should consider the iPad mini, which starts at $499 and has a faster A17 Pro chip. On the other hand, for an iPad with better specifications, there is the $599 iPad Air, which offers a faster M3 chip, features like Stage Manager, and improved display technologies.\nApple's 2025 iPad\nContents\nApple introduced the latest low-cost iPad in March 2025, adding an upgraded A16 chip, 128GB of starting storage, and a few other minor tweaks, but no major changes or design updates. Unlike many of Apple's other recently updated devices, the iPad 11 does not support Apple Intelligence.\nThe 11th-generation iPad has the same squared-off all-display design of the iPad mini and iPad Air and it comes in Silver, Blue, Pink, and Yellow. Instead of a Home button, there is a Touch ID Top button of the iPad, and a front-facing camera at the landscape edge of the device for video calls while the iPad is in landscape mode.\nThe 11th-generation iPad offers an 11-inch Liquid Retina display with a resolution of 2360 by 1640 pixels, 500 nits of brightness, and True Tone technology, but it does not have some of the bells and whistles of other iPad displays such as an anti-reflective coating.\nThe iPad now features Apple's A16 chip with a 5-core CPU and a 4-core GPU. The A16 chip does not support Apple Intelligence, but it is faster than the prior-generation A14 chip that was in the iPad 10.\nThe iPad features a 12-megapixel camera with support for 4K video recording and upgraded Smart HDR 4, Wi-Fi 6 support, Bluetooth 5.3, and 5G connectivity on cellular models.\nThe iPad supports the USB-C Apple Pencil and the the first-generation Apple Pencil with an adapter to charge and pair it. The 11th-generation iPad also works with the Magic Keyboard Folio, which offers full-size keys with 1 mm of travel, a multi-touch trackpad, a function row, a two-piece design, and a kickstand back cover.\nThe iPad starts at $349 for 128GB of storage and is available for preorder from the Apple online store and Apple retail stores. The original Apple Pencil is available separately for $99, as is the USB-C Apple Pencil, priced at $79. The Magic Keyboard Folio is sold separately too for $249.\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here.\nHow to Buy\nThe 11-inch 11th-generation iPad can be ordered from the online Apple Store and the retailers starting at $349.\nDesign\nWith the launch of the 10th-generation iPad, Apple overhauled the design, introducing a look similar to the iPad Pro and the iPad Air with an all-display design and no Home button, and there have been no changes to that design with the 11th-generation iPad.\nThere is an edge-to-edge display with slim bezels and an aluminum chassis with flat, rounded edges, much like the iPad Air. The iPad 11 comes in four colors, including blue, pink, silver, and yellow.\nThe iPad measures in at 9.79 inches (248.6 mm) long, 7.07 inches (179.5 mm) wide, and 0.28 inches (7 mm) thick. It is just a bit bigger than the iPad Air, but a good deal thicker than its 6.1-mm sibling. It weighs in at 1.05 pounds (477 grams) with cellular models weighing just a few grams more.\nThough there is an all-display design, the iPad does not use Face ID. Like the iPad Air and the iPad mini, it has a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the power button. The fingerprint sensor scans the finger much like a Touch ID Home button, but it is smaller and more compact. Touch ID can be used to unlock the iPad, access apps, make purchases with Apple Pay, and more.\nThere is a single-lens camera at the back of the iPad, a front-facing camera on the right side of the front, along with speakers at the top and bottom, a microphone at the back, volume up and down buttons at the side, a USB-C port for charging, and a Smart Connector along the side edge for accessories.\nDisplay\nThe iPad has an 11-inch Retina LED display with a resolution of 2360 x 1640 at 264 pixels per inch. It is the least advanced display compared to the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini models, which is how Apple keeps the iPad affordable.\nNote that Apple says the iPad 11 has an 11-inch display while the iPad 10 had a 10.9-inch display, but the display has not changed at all, and the difference comes from the way that Apple has decided to round the display size.\nThe display features 500 nits of brightness, and it supports True Tone. True Tone allows the temperature of the display to change to be warmer or cooler, matching the lighting in the room that you're in so there's not a stark difference between the color of the display and the ambient light.\nThe display is also equipped with a touch sensor that allows it to work with the Apple Pencil, and it has a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating.\nA16 Chip\nThe iPad is equipped with an A16 chip that was first used in the iPhone 14 Pro models, but it is worth noting that the A16 chip in the iPad 11 has a 5-core CPU, 4-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine.\nThe A16 chip is up to 30 percent faster than the A14 Bionic chip from the prior-generation iPad. Apple says that the A16 is up to 6x faster than the best-selling Android tablet.\nAs the iPad has an A16 and not an A17 Pro or better, it does not support Apple Intelligence. The A16 is capable of running Final Cut Pro for iPad, though, and it is an affordable way to access professional video editing capabilities.\nStorage\nThe iPad starts with 128GB of storage, a new minimum in 2025. There are also 256GB and 512GB upgrade options, and the 512GB option is new this year.\nRAM\nThe iPad 11 has 6GB RAM, up from 4GB in the prior-generation model.\nBattery Life\nThe iPad is equipped with a 28.6-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery, and it continues to offer up to 10 hours of battery life when surfing the web or watching video.\nRear Camera\nThe iPad 11 uses a 12-megapixel Wide camera, which is the same camera that's in the iPad Air. It has an \u0192/1.8 aperture, Smart HDR 4 support, Burst mode, Live Photos with stabilization, autofocus with Focus Pixels, wide color capture, exposure control, auto image stabilization, noise reduction, and more.\n4K video recording is supported at 20, 30, or 60 frames per second, as is slo-mo video at 120 or 240 frames per second. The iPad can also record in 1080p at 30 or 60 frames per second, and it supports continuous autofocus, cinematic video stabilization, and the option to take 8-megapixel still photos when recording 4K video.\nFaceTime Camera\nThough there's no TrueDepth camera system to support Face ID in the iPad Air, there is a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front facing camera with a 122 degree field of view and an \u0192/2.4 aperture. The camera supports Center Stage, designed to keep users perfectly framed on screen during video calls. With the wider field of view, the camera can zoom in as appropriate and follow people around the room as they move.\nWhen other people join in on a call, the camera is able to detect them, and it zooms out to fit everyone into the view. Center Stage is designed for FaceTime, but it also works with third-party video apps like Zoom and Skype.\nThe camera is positioned on the side of the iPad so that it is upright when in a landscape orientation, similar to the camera on a MacBook. This is the first time that Apple has used this particular camera orientation.\nOther Features\n5G\nCellular models of the 11th-generation iPad have a 5G chip that allows them to connect to 5G networks, but it does not support the fastest mmWave 5G networks and is limited to the slower but more widespread Sub-6GHz networks.\nmmWave 5G networks are the fastest 5G networks, but mmWave is short-range and can be obscured by buildings, trees, and other obstacles, so its use is limited to major cities and urban areas along with venues like stadiums, arenas, airports, and other places where a lot of people congregate. Sub-6GHz 5G is much more widely available and available in urban, suburban, and rural areas across the United States and other countries.\nThe prior-generation iPad 10 supported eSIM and had a physical SIM slot, but the new iPad 11 only has eSIM for selecting a cellular network.\nWi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Sensors\nThe iPad supports 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3. The iPad includes a three-axis gyro, an accelerometer, an ambient light sensor, and a barometer.\nUSB-C Port\nThe iPad is equipped with a USB-C charging port. The USB-C port in the 11th-generation iPad is slower than the USB-C port available in the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini models. It is limited to USB 2.0 speeds of up to 480Mb/s for data transfer.\nAccessories\nApple Pencil\nThe iPad is compatible with both the $99 original Apple Pencil and the $79 USB-C Apple Pencil that Apple announced in October 2023.\nThe Apple Pencil is a stylus that's designed to offer unparalleled precision and integration with the iPad while also offering a natural feel that's similar to the sensation of using a pen or pencil on paper.\nThere are pressure and positioning sensors built into the original Apple Pencil to allow it to detect a range of forces for pressure-sensitive drawing and writing, but this feature is not available in the USB-C Apple Pencil. Two tilt sensors in the tip of the Apple Pencil determine the orientation and angle of the hand holding it, enabling shading techniques.\nThe Apple Pencil offers a 12-hour battery life and it charges through the built-in Lightning connector at the bottom of the device. A 15-second charge delivers a half-hour of power, so it's always going to have juice when needed.\nBecause the first-generation Apple Pencil charges using an integrated Lightning connector, to charge it with the iPad, a Lightning to USB-C adapter is required. The USB-C Apple Pencil has a hidden USB-C port so it needs a USB-C cable to charge.\nMagic Keyboard\nApple sells a $249 Magic Keyboard Folio alongside the iPad, with the accessory able to turn the iPad into a mini notebook. It is a full-size keyboard with a built-in trackpad and a 14-key function row.\nThe keyboard features two pieces, so a cover and kickstand can be used separately from the detachable keyboard. Both pieces magnetically attach to the iPad.\nWhat's Next for the iPad\nApple is working on a next-generation low-cost iPad with an updated chip, and it is expected to come out in early 2026."

      "text": "FaceTime is Apple's video and audio chatting platform that lets iPhone users communicate with one another through the standard FaceTime video protocol or using the FaceTime audio feature.\nAs a key iPhone, iPad, and Mac feature, FaceTime is widely known, but if you're new to FaceTime, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know. Even established FaceTime users may learn a trick or two.\nSetting Up FaceTime\nIf you have an iPhone, FaceTime, much like iMessage, is activated automatically using your phone number, but you can also choose to use it with an email address instead. Getting FaceTime up and running happens automatically after your iPhone is activated with a SIM card, but if for some reason it's not working or it's been turned off, you can follow the steps in the how to below.\nWhen you use an iPhone with FaceTime, your other devices can also use your phone number to place FaceTime calls so long as you are signed into the same iCloud account on all of them.\nIf you don't have an iPhone, FaceTime can be set up on an iPad, iPod touch, or Mac through the FaceTime app using an email address.\n- How to Set Up FaceTime on an iPhone\n- How to Set up FaceTime on an iPad\n- How to Set Up FaceTime on a Mac\n- How to Turn Off FaceTime\nThere is no option to entirely remove a phone number from FaceTime, though if you have an iPhone with dual-SIM capabilities, you can choose between two different numbers. You can choose to use an email address with FaceTime instead of a phone number, and there are also options to change the email address that you're using.\n- How to Use FaceTime With an Email Address Instead of a Phone Number\n- How to Change Your FaceTime Email Address\nFaceTime Video vs. FaceTime Audio\nThere are two ways to use FaceTime. You can use FaceTime video, which is the standard way to use FaceTime with a two-way video connection (or more, with Group FaceTime), or you can use FaceTime Audio, which, as the name suggests, is an audio-only option.\nFaceTime video is great for when you want to see the person on the other end of the call, while FaceTime Audio is basically akin to a voice-based phone call. FaceTime Audio often offers better call quality than a regular phone call because it's a VoIP service similar to something like Skype.\n- How to Make a FaceTime Call\n- How to Make a FaceTime Audio Call\n- How to Make a FaceTime Call With Siri\n- How to Switch From FaceTime Video to FaceTime Audio\n- How to Switch From FaceTime Audio to FaceTime Video\n- How to Switch from a Regular Phone Call to FaceTime\n- How to Mirror a FaceTime Call to Apple TV or an AirPlay 2-Compatible Smart TV\n- How to Record a FaceTime Call on Your Mac\nDevices Compatible With FaceTime\nFaceTime is an app that's available across Apple devices. FaceTime Video and FaceTime Audio work on the iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, and Mac.\nYou can answer and place FaceTime Audio calls on the HomePod and the Apple Watch, but video calls do not work on these devices.\nMaking a FaceTime Video Call\nMaking a FaceTime video call is as simple as opening up the FaceTime app on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, tapping the \"New FaceTime\" button, choosing a contact, and tapping on the \"FaceTime\" option for video, or the little phone icon for audio.\nFaceTime can also be initiated through the Contacts app by selecting a contact and choosing the FaceTime option, or through the Messages app by tapping on a person's name in an iMessage thread and then choosing the FaceTime option. You can also set up Favorites through the Contacts app and make a FaceTime call through the Phone app (iPhone) or through the Favorites widget in the Today section of the Notification Center (iPhone and iPad).\nNote that you can choose from FaceTime Audio or Video in the FaceTime app, but initiating FaceTime through Contacts or Messages initiates a video call right away.\nWhen you initiate a FaceTime call with someone, the front-facing camera on your Mac, iPad, or iPhone will activate so that the person on the other end can see you. Unlike with a phone call, FaceTime calls often reach the other person near instantaneously.\nAnswering an incoming FaceTime video call will also activate the front-facing camera on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac because FaceTime is primarily a video chatting platform.\nMaking a FaceTime Audio Call\nIf you want to initiate a call with someone but want to use voice chat instead of video, you can use FaceTime Audio. Unlike a traditional phone call, FaceTime Audio can be placed on the iPhone, iPad, or Mac, and it uses either a WiFi or cellular connection.\nFaceTime Audio can be preferable to a standard phone call because it's often higher quality because it uses a higher-quality codec that exceeds even HD voice services offered by carriers.\nA FaceTime Audio call is easiest to place in the FaceTime app by choosing a person to contact and then tapping the phone icon instead of the FaceTime option. The other option for FaceTime Audio is using Favorites set up in the Phone app or the Favorites Widget in the Notification Center.\nYou can also activate FaceTime Audio in Messages by tapping on a contact and then choosing the \"Audio\" option, or in the Contacts app by tapping on the phone icon under the FaceTime heading. FaceTime Audio is the only version of FaceTime that works on the Apple Watch.\nFaceTime on Android and PCs\nAs of iOS 15, FaceTime can be used across different platforms. Apple created FaceTime links because there's a new option to join FaceTime calls on the web, which means PC and Android users can participate in FaceTime for the first time.\nAn iPhone, Mac, or iPad user needs to create a FaceTime link, but once created, anyone can tap it to join. To join from the web, Chrome or Edge browsers are required. FaceTime from the web works on-on-one or in Group FaceTime calls.\nCreate a FaceTime Link\nApple changed how FaceTime works in iOS 15, so you can create something more akin to a Zoom link, but for FaceTime. You can make a FaceTime link that other people can tap to join your FaceTime call.\nLinks let you schedule FaceTime calls in advance and then share the links with others so everyone can join the meeting or group chat at the appropriate time. FaceTime integrates directly with the Apple Calendar app.\nTo create a link, just open up the FaceTime app and then tap the \"Create Link\" option next to \"New FaceTime.\" You can share the link in a text message, another messaging service, an email, or AirDrop it, and people can click it to join in.\nUsing FaceTime Over WiFi\nFaceTime works best when using WiFi, because a video connection between two parties can be data heavy. You're going to get the clearest picture when using a high-speed WiFi or cellular connection.\nFaceTime will use WiFi by default when connected to a WiFi network on iPhone, iPad, or Mac.\nIf your connection speeds aren't high enough, video will look pixelated and when connection speeds are very slow, the video feed will cut off entirely. FaceTime Audio requires less data than standard FaceTime, but with very poor connectivity, it can fail or sound distorted.\nUsing FaceTime Over LTE/5G\nOn devices with an LTE connection like an iPhone or iPad (or a Mac connected to a hotspot), FaceTime works over cellular as well.\nMost cellular phone plans no longer have limited minutes, but FaceTime Audio and the standard FaceTime video do not use up cell phone minutes. It's worth noting that FaceTime does eat up data, and how much data it uses will vary by device, connection quality, and other factors.\nYou can see how much data you've used in a FaceTime call by opening up the FaceTime app and tapping on the \"i\" next to a person in your recent call list. More detailed instructions are below:\nFaceTiming With Multiple People Using Group FaceTime\nWith Group FaceTime, you can video (or audio) chat with up to 32 people at one time.\nGroup FaceTime presents all of the participants in a tiled view, with the size of each person's tile varying based on the number of participants in the chat. The tile size for the person speaking at the moment will get larger to provide attention to that person, but you can also use Focus View to double tap on any participant that you want to see in the chat.\nNew people can be added to an existing Group FaceTime chat at any time, so you can start up a chat with a group of friends and then add other people as time goes on. Group FaceTime calls send a ringless notification to participants that can be tapped to join.\nYou can also set up a Group FaceTime call through the Messages app by tapping on the FaceTime option in a group chat.\nGroup FaceTime calls can be answered on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, or HomePod, but with the latter two options, users can only join chats with audio and no video.\nGroup FaceTime is available on all devices where FaceTime is available, but on older Apple devices, Group FaceTime is available in an audio-only capacity. This includes the iPhone 5s, iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, iPad mini 2, iPad mini 3, and iPad Air.\nAutomatic Prominence in Group FaceTime\nApple in iOS 13.5 added a feature for Group FaceTime that lets you toggle off Automatic Prominence, aka the feature that makes people's tiles change size depending on who happens to be speaking.\nWith Automatic Prominence turned off, people's tiles won't get bigger when they speak, and will instead be displayed in a grid view with equal sizes. There's also an option to enable Automatic Prominence when someone who uses sign language is detected so you can see what's being signed.\n- How to Turn Off Moving Faces in Group FaceTime on Mac\n- How to Turn off Moving Faces in Group FaceTime\nFaceTime Compact UI\nAs of iOS and iPadOS 14, an incoming FaceTime call no longer takes over the entire display of the iPhone or the iPad, with the call instead showing up as a small banner.\nThe banner is interactive and can be tapped to accept or decline a FaceTime call, with more information available in our guide to the iOS 14 interface.\nPicture in Picture\nWith iOS 14, you can do other things on your iPhone while chatting with a FaceTime window open thanks to the new Picture in Picture mode that's available.\nSwiping out of FaceTime will now open up a Picture in Picture window that can be resized, so you can use apps without having FaceTime paused. More info on Picture in Picture and how to use it can be found in our Picture in Picture guide.\nEye Contact\nIf you enable the \"Eye Contact\" feature in FaceTime's settings, it tweaks the FaceTime video to make it look like you're making eye contact with the person you're talking to while you're looking at the iPhone or iPad's screen.\nUsing Memoji and Animoji When in FaceTime\nWhen using FaceTime for a video chat, you can choose to overlay an Animoji or Memoji character over your head, which is a fun way to chat with kids or to add a bit of whimsy to a conversation.\nYou can choose any of the emoji-like Animoji characters or any of the Memoji that you've created for use in the Messages app. Animoji and Memoji use the TrueDepth camera system to track your head and mouth movements for a very realistic interactive experience.\nBecause TrueDepth is required, this feature is limited to devices that have a TrueDepth camera and it will not work on older devices. Animoji and Memoji also only work on the iPhone and the iPad, with no Mac option available.\nAdding a Memoji or Animoji to cover your face in FaceTime is as simple as tapping on your picture when you're on a FaceTime call, then tapping the star icon, aka the \"Effects\" icon. From there, tap on the \"Memoji\" icon (face in a square) on the left side.\nUsing Effects in FaceTime\nAlong with Animoji and Memoji, you can apply filters, stickers, animated shapes, Memoji and Animoji stickers, and text to your FaceTime video to spice it up.\nThere are a range of filters to choose from, ranging from those that simply tweak colors to those that add effects like watercolor, comic book, aged film, ink, and more.\nAs for stickers, there are some animated shapes available by default along with Memoji and Amimoji stickers that are emoji-like still versions of Animoji/Memoji, plus you can use any sticker pack purchased from the App Store or made available through an app you already have installed.\nCapturing a Live Photo With FaceTime\nWhen using FaceTime for a video call, you can capture a Live Photo of a moment during a chat. All you need to do to take a Live Photo is to tap on the display to bring up the camera button and then tap the camera button.\nTapping on the camera button lets you know that you took a Live Photo, and it lets the person on the other end of the call know that you took a Live Photo. That prevents people from taking Live Photos of you during a chat without your knowledge.\nTo use this feature, the participants in the video call need to have Live Photos in FaceTime enabled, which can be found by opening up Settings, choosing FaceTime, and then toggling on FaceTime Live Photos.\nIf you disable this by toggling it off, no one will be able to take FaceTime Live Photos when chatting with you.\nUsing SharePlay\nSharePlay is a major FaceTime feature that was introduced in iOS 15, and it's basically a way for you to do more on FaceTime calls with your friends and family. You can watch TV together, listen to music, and share your screen. SharePlay is was introduced in iOS 15.1, iPadOS 15.1, tvOS 15.1, and macOS Monterey 12.1 after being delayed from the initial launch versions of the software.\nSharePlay makes the FaceTime experience a whole lot better because it can be used for screen sharing, watching movies and TV together, or listening to music with Apple Music. Third-party app developers can also build SharePlay into their apps, so there are a whole range of new FaceTime games and experiences.\n- iOS 15: How to Share Your Screen on a FaceTime Call\n- iOS 15: How to Watch Movies Together Using FaceTime\nFor a full rundown on SharePlay and other features introduced in the iOS 15 update, we have a dedicated guide.\nBlocking Unwanted FaceTime Calls\nIf you're getting unwanted FaceTime video and audio calls, there is an option to put a stop to them through the built-in blocking feature in the Contacts app. You can tap on the little \"i\" button next to name or number in the list of recent FaceTime calls in the FaceTime app or the Phone app to bring up a little contact card.\nThe contact card will have a \"Block this Caller\" option at the bottom, and if you tap it, that person will no longer be able to contact you.\n- How to Block Unwanted FaceTime Calls\n- How to Check the FaceTime Numbers you Have Blocked\n- How to Unblock People on FaceTime\nCountries Where FaceTime is Available\nFaceTime is available in almost all countries around the world, with the exception of the United Arab Emirates. To use FaceTime in Saudi Arabia, an iPhone or iPad must be running iOS 11.3 or later, and to use FaceTime in Pakistan, devices must run iOS 12.4 or later.\nDevices purchased in certain Middle Eastern countries will also block FaceTime if a SIM card from a non Middle Eastern country is inserted. FaceTime Audio is not available in China. All iPhones and iPads sold in China are limited to the standard FaceTime with video feature.\nNote that if you purchase an iPhone or iPad in China or the United Arab Emirates and then attempt to use it in another country, the FaceTime features listed above will be disabled. Purchasing an iPhone from China or the Middle East is not recommended unless you live in those places.\nGuide Feedback\nHave questions about FaceTime, know of something we left out, or want to offer feedback on this guide?

      "text": "Should You Buy AirPods Pro?\nThe AirPods Pro 2 are Apple's premium in-ear wireless earbuds, offering a range of features like Active Noise Cancellation, precision finding, touch volume controls, and more. Refreshed in September 2023 with a USB-C port, the AirPods Pro 2 are getting closer to the end of their product cycle and rumors suggest that we're going to get an update later in 2025. At this point, most people should wait to buy the AirPods Pro, though it's still a reasonable time to buy for those who don't care about having the newest bells and whistles.\nThe next-generation AirPods Pro are expected to feature a refreshed design, improved ANC and sound quality, and they may get health-related features like heart rate monitoring and temperature sensing.\nWith a $249 price tag, AirPods can be more expensive than some of their direct competitors, but it's important to note that the H2 chips inside the AirPods offer a seamless and fully integrated pairing and device-switching experience for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV users, which competitors are unable to match. The H2 chips also enable features like Adaptive EQ and spatial audio with dynamic head tracking. This means that when used with Apple devices, AirPods seem to be the best option for earbuds when it comes to features.\nIf you are looking for AirPods without an in-ear design, there are the AirPods 4, which start at $129. For an even higher-fidelity AirPods experience and an over-ear design, there are the AirPods Max which start at $549. On the other hand, if you feel that the AirPods Pro are too expensive, but you would still like Apple's seamless pairing and device-switching experience, Beats headphones are also viable options, with prices starting from as little as $69 for Beats Flex.\nTo get MacRumors readers the best prices on the AirPods Pro, we have a dedicated AirPods deals guide that highlights the best sales each month.\nAirPods Pro 2\nContents\n- Should You Buy AirPods Pro?\n- AirPods Pro 2\n- How to Buy\n- Reviews\n- AirPods Pro Design\n- Active Noise Cancellation\n- Sound Quality\n- H2 Chip\n- Gesture Support\n- Hearing Health\n- Other AirPods Features\n- Features Coming in iOS 26\n- Battery Life\n- Find My\n- Firmware\n- AirPods Pro How Tos\n- Other AirPods\n- What's Next for the AirPods Pro\n- AirPods Pro Roundup Changelog\n- AirPods Pro Timeline\nApple in September 2023 refreshed the AirPods Pro, introducing a new version of the AirPods Pro 2 that initially came out in September 2022.\nApple did not introduce any design changes for the updated AirPods Pro 2, but they do have a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. Apple also added support for Lossless Audio when the USB-C AirPods Pro 2 are paired with the upcoming Apple Vision Pro headset, and improved dust resistance. Aside from these features, the USB-C AirPods Pro 2 are identical to the AirPods Pro 2 with Lightning port that came out in 2022.\nThe AirPods Pro feature a rounded design with silicone ear tips and a short stem that harken back to the first AirPods. As with all in-ear AirPods, the AirPods Pro come only in white, with no other color options available.\nApple added an updated H2 chip that enables new capabilities, including Active Noise Cancellation that's twice as good. Noise-cancelling microphones and a rear vent detect sound coming in, countering it before it reaches the ear. Apple says the AirPods Pro 2 reduce noise by sampling incoming sound at 48,000 times per second.\nTransparency mode has been updated with an Adaptive Transparency feature that is designed to reduce loud environmental noise without blocking out all sound. It can cut down on the sound of a passing vehicle siren, construction tools, loud speakers at a concert, and more. This is done using on-device processing enabled by the H2 chip.\nAlong with an H2 chip, the AirPods Pro 2 are equipped with a low-distortion audio driver and a custom amplifier, which Apple says bring richer bass and crystal-clear sound across a wider range of frequencies.\nFor a more customized fit, AirPods Pro now have silicone ear tips in XS, S, M, and L sizes, with XS available as the new size option.\nPersonalized Spatial Audio is available for an optimized, immersive surround sound experience with dynamic head tracking, and Adaptive EQ customizes the sound so you hear songs as they were intended based on how the AirPods Pro fit in your ears.\nThe AirPods Pro 2 stems now include Touch control, adding physical media playback and volume adjustment options that can be accessed right on the earbuds. A swipe up or down on the AirPods Pro touch sensor enables volume adjustments, and a press can change the music or answer phone calls, plus \"Hey Siri\" support is included.\nAirPods Pro features like seamless switching between devices signed into the same iCloud account, quick one-tap setup, and audio sharing are all supported.\nBattery life is improved and the AirPods Pro 2 last for up to six hours on a single charge when Active Noise Cancellation is turned on. The included charging case provides a total of 30 hours of listening time, six hours more than the prior-generation model.\nThe AirPods Pro 2 MagSafe Charging Case can be charged using Qi, MagSafe, or the Apple Watch charging puck, a new feature. The case is IPX4 sweat and water resistant and it is now equipped with a lanyard loop so you can add an optional lanyard.\nThere's also a built-in speaker in the case so you can find your AirPods Pro charging case with Find My should it become lost, and with Precision Finding that uses the new U1 chip, the Find My app can direct you right to your lost AirPods Pro case.\nA new set of hearing health features for the AirPods Pro 2 can assist with protecting users from loud noise, conduct scientifically validated hearing tests to measure potential hearing loss, and serve as an over-the-counter clinical-grade hearing aid for those experiencing hearing loss.\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here.\nHow to Buy\nThe AirPods Pro 2 can be ordered from the Apple online store or purchased in an Apple retail location. AirPods Pro are priced at $249, and can be customized with a Memoji, Animoji, or emoji engraving.\nApple's refurbished store sells the AirPods Pro 2 with Lightning case at a discounted price.\nReviews\nInitial reviews of the AirPods Pro 2 praised the device's improved audio quality, longer battery life, and up to 2x as much noise cancellation compared to the original AirPods Pro. They also discussed the swipe-based volume controls, skin-detect sensors that more accurately turn on or off audio playback, and the new XS ear tip option.\nThe Verge's Chris Welch said there are \"substantial\" improvements to active noise cancellation:\nBut Apple has made substantial gains with its active noise cancellation. The company says, on average, the new implementation is \"up to\" two times as effective as the original AirPods Pro. And while I lack any scientific measurement tools, that claim doesn't seem unrealistic. At our office, I recently moved desks and now sit near an air vent that emits a persistent whir. The original AirPods Pro leave a trace of that in noise-canceling mode, but it's completely hushed and imperceptible with the second-gen pair. I can still hear chatting co-workers if they walk directly next to my desk, but at most times, the AirPods Pro grant me plenty of serenity. I've also observed legitimate improvements when commuting on the subway, and less overall street noise makes its way through when traversing Brooklyn day to day.\nWelch also noticed improved sound quality overall:\nLet's dig right into sound quality. Apple completely redesigned the amplifier and driver in the AirPods Pro, and while those drivers are the same 11-millimeter size as what's in the third-gen AirPods, they sound superior and deliver the cleanest, most dynamic output of any AirPods to date.\nEngadget's Billy Steele achieved around six hours of battery life as advertised:\nDuring my tests, I managed six hours and fifteen minutes of use with a mix of noise cancellation, transparency mode and calls. That's more than the previous generation (4.5 hours) and it's on par with most of the competition these days. Sure, some companies offer 10-plus hours on a charge, but the average is around five to seven for the noise-canceling products I've tested. More battery life would always be nice, but the six or seven hours Apple musters is enough to get you through the workday if you take a short break.\nGizmodo's Andrew Liszewski said the new swipe-based volume control feature is a welcomed upgrade, but can be \"a little finicky\" on occasion:\nIt's a welcome upgrade, but unfortunately one that I found a little finicky to make work. It occasionally required a couple of swipes before anything happened. As someone who generally hates having to touch my earbuds while I'm wearing them (it inevitably dislodges them a little) I will probably continue to stick to using Siri voice commands for volume adjustments or track skipping (the one thing Siri does very well).\nMobileSyrup's Patrick O'Rourke said swipe-based volume control is his favorite new AirPods Pro feature, providing for a more convenient listening experience:\nIn my experience, the new AirPods Pro volume touch controls are extremely responsive and work with subtle changes. If you, for example, only want to lower or raise the volume by a notch or two, you can do that with a brief swipe. The controls are also marked with a slight clicking noise, indicating they're active and working. I didn't run into any accidental presses during my several days with the AirPods Pro (2nd-Gen), even while long-pressing on the stem to toggle Active Noise Cancellation on/off or double-pressing to jump between songs. On-device touch volume controls are by far my favourite new AirPods Pro feature. The convenience and ease of use of shifting volume levels directly on the AirPods Pro (2nd-Gen) without the need to take out my iPhone, really can't be understated.\nO'Rourke added that iOS 16's Personalized Spatial Audio feature is not very noticeable:\nIn theory, I like the idea of audio being tuned specifically to the shape of your ear, but in practice, it doesn't make much of a difference. It's also worth noting that while I really like Spatial Audio when watching movies or TV shows on platforms like Apple TV+, I find it hit or miss with music, especially when a track wasn't originally recorded with the technology in mind and has been remastered.\nWIRED's Parker Hall said the charging case's new built-in speaker \"rings quite loudly\" to assist with Find My location tracking, but he wishes the case had a USB-C port for wired charging instead of the usual Lightning connector:\nNeed to find the case via Apple's Find My app? Now you can, and it rings quite loudly. It also makes a little jingle when it starts charging. Speaking of, you can wireless charge as usual (the case supports MagSafe too), but it's a shame to see Apple still relying on the Lightning port instead of USB-C.\nAirPods Pro Design\nThe AirPods Pro 2 feature the same design as the original AirPods Pro, despite rumors that we could see some major changes. There were rumors of a stemless design, but that did not pan out, and Apple is continuing to use the same rounded in-ear bud with flexible silicone tips and a short stem.\nApple designed the silicone tips to confirm to the contours of each individual ear, ensuring a comfortable fit and a good seal, an important factor for noise cancellation. The AirPods Pro 2 tips come in extra small, small, medium, and large, and the tips click into place on the AirPods Pro for easy swapping.\nThe AirPods Pro measure in at 30.9mm tall and 21.8mm wide, identical to the original AirPods Pro. They weigh 5.3 grams.\nThere is a skin-detect sensor in the AirPods that is designed to better detect when the AirPods are removed from the ears in order to preserve battery life.\nThe AirPods Pro 2 continue to feature a vent system for pressure equalization when using Active Noise Cancellation. It is designed to minimize the discomfort that can happen with other earbud designs.\nMagSafe Charging Case\nApple is selling the AirPods Pro 2 with an updated MagSafe Charging Case that has a magnet inside for use with MagSafe charging accessories.\nThe case measures in at 60.6mm wide, 45.2mm tall, and 21.7mm thick, so despite the addition of a new charging feature, the case is identical to the first-generation AirPods Pro case, though it is slightly heavier. The AirPods Pro MagSafe Charging Case weighs 50.8 grams for a total weight of 56.1 grams with the AirPods Pro inside. The original AirPods Pro case weighed 45.6 grams.\nNew to the Charging Case is a lanyard loop for attaching third-party lanyards, and a speaker that can allow the case to play a sound when used with the Find My feature.\nThere is a U1 chip in the MagSafe Charging Case which allows it to work with Precision Finding in the Find My app with an iPhone that has an Ultra Wideband chip.\nWater Resistance\nApple says that the AirPods Pro and the MagSafe Charging Case are \"sweat and water resistant,\" offering IPX4 water resistance. IPX4 water resistance was also a feature of the original AirPods Pro, but the case is more water resistant now.\nIPX4 water resistance means the AirPods Pro and the case can hold up to sweat and light rain, but they should not be submerged and liquid exposure should be avoided when possible. Apple's warranty does not cover water or sweat damage.\nEar Tip Fit Test\nTo get the perfect fit and best audio experience, Apple offers an Ear Tip Fit Test for the AirPods Pro. After placing the AirPods Pro in each ear, Apple uses advanced algorithms and the microphones in each AirPod to measure the sound level in the ear and compare it to what's coming from the speaker driver.\nThe algorithm then detects whether the ear tip is the right size and has a good fit, or if it should be swapped out for another size to create a better seal. AirPods Pro silicone tips come in XS, S, M, and L, with XS offered as a new option.\nActive Noise Cancellation\nActive Noise Cancellation (ANC) has been notably improved, and the AirPods Pro 2 cancel up to twice as much noise as the prior-generation AirPods Pro.\nANC uses the microphones built into the AirPods Pro along with Apple's software algorithms to adapt sound to each person's ear. The outward-facing microphone detects external sound so the AirPods Pro can analyze environmental noise, while the inward-facing microphone listens to the sound coming toward the ear. ANC adapts the sound signal reaching the ears 48,000 times per second.\nThe AirPods Pro 2 are equipped with a new driver and improved acoustic algorithms to reduce more unwanted noise.\nAdaptive Transparency\nApple updated the AirPods Pro with a new Adaptive Transparency feature that builds on the Transparency mode introduced with the first-generation AirPods Pro.\nTransparency Mode is designed to allow AirPods Pro users to hear the world around them, listening for traffic, train announcements, and more while also not blocking out music, podcasts, and other audio content.\nApple's new Adaptive Transparency uses on-device processing to reduce loud environmental sounds to a more comfortable level. It can lower the volume of a passing vehicle siren, construction tools, or loud speakers at a concert.\nAdaptive Audio\nFor the AirPods Pro 2, an Adaptive Audio option blends the Transparency and Active Noise Cancellation modes into one, automatically tailoring noise control based on your environment and interactions throughout the day.\nAdaptive Audio is meant to drown out the environmental sounds that you don't want to hear like construction noise or the noise of an airplane, while letting you hear important announcements and conversations.\nPersonalized Volume adjusts the sound of what's playing based on your personal preferences and the sounds around you, with the iPhone learning more about the volume you like over time. With Conversation Awareness, when someone is speaking, media volume is lowered, background noise is reduced, and the voices in front of you are enhanced.\nSound Quality\nApple's AirPods Pro 2 are outfitted with an updated custom high-excursion low-distortion Apple driver and a custom high dynamic range amplifier, which Apple says brings richer, deeper bass and crystal-clear sound at all volume levels.\nMicrophones\nThere are two dual beamforming microphones and an inward-facing microphone for Active Noise Cancellation purposes.\nAdaptive EQ\nAdaptive EQ is designed to improve sound quality by taking into account the shape of the ear. The feature uses computational audio and an updated internal microphone pointed toward the ear to optimize sound for each person.\nSound is tuned in real time based on the fit of the AirPod in the user's ear, with the AirPods Pro adjusting and tuning the low and mid frequencies for consistent playback every time.\nApple says the new H2 chip uses new adaptation algorithms to process sound more quickly, tuning audio at the precise second that it is heard, for higher-fidelity sound. Phone calls also sound more natural thanks to voice enhancement algorithms.\nSpatial Audio\nApple introduced Spatial Audio in 2021, bringing a surround sound like experience to Apple Music, the Apple TV app, and more. With Dolby Atmos tracks in Apple Music, the AirPods Pro can provide a multi-dimensional audio experience that makes it so the sound comes from all around you.\nSpatial audio applies directional audio filters and subtly adjusts the frequencies that each ear receives to place sounds virtually anywhere in space for an immersive listening experience. The feature uses sensors in the AirPods Pro along with sensors in the iPhone or iPad to track the motion of a person's head as well as the position of their device, comparing the motion data and remapping the sound field so that it stays anchored to the device even as the head moves.\nDynamic head tracking works with spatial audio and on Group FaceTime calls so it sounds like the FaceTime participants are right in the room with you.\nThe AirPods Pro also support Personalized Spatial Audio, which is an iOS 16 feature. With Personalized Spatial Audio, you can use your TrueDepth camera to scan the area around you to create a custom sound experience.\nVoice Isolation\nVoice Isolation cuts down on background noise so your voice sounds clearer to the person you're speaking with on a phone call. The microphones on the AirPods Pro will avoid picking up ambient noise with Voice Isolation, prioritizing your voice.\nVision Pro Lossless Audio\nWhen paired with the Apple Vision Pro, the 2023 AirPods Pro with a USB-C port support 20-bit 48kHz lossless audio. Lossless audio with the Apple Vision Pro is limited to the newest version of the AirPods Pro 2, and this feature is not be available on the original AirPods Pro 2.\nH2 Chip\nThere is a new H2 chip inside the AirPods Pro 2, which is an improvement over the prior H1 chip. The H2 powers all of the features in the AirPods, including Active Noise Cancellation, Transparency Mode, and Adaptive EQ.\nThe H2 chip also continues to enable the features AirPods have come to be known for, including fast switching between Apple devices that are signed into the same iCloud account, \"Hey Siri\" support, instant pairing, and Audio Sharing, which allows more than one set of AirPods to be paired to a single device.\nBluetooth\nThe AirPods Pro support the latest Bluetooth 5.3 specification. Bluetooth 5.3 includes enhancements that can improve reliability and energy efficiency. The specification also includes LE Audio, but Apple does not yet appear to have implemented support for LE Audio.\nOther Sensors\nThere's a motion-detecting accelerometer and a speech detecting accelerometer in the AirPods Pro in addition to the skin-detect sensor. All of these sensors work together to power AirPods features like ear detection.\nGesture Support\n- Swipe up or down on the stem to adjust the volume\n- Press once to play/pause\n- Press once to answer an incoming phone call\n- Press twice to skip forward\n- Press three times to skip back\n- Press and hold to swap between ANC and Adaptive Transparency\n- Nod yes to accept calls, shake your head to decline. Also works for Siri responses\nHearing Health\nWith iOS 18.1, Apple introduced a new suite of hearing health features for the AirPods Pro 2 encompassing prevention, awareness, and assistance related to hearing loss. Hearing Protection, on by default across all listening modes, helps reduce loud sounds with a combination of passive noise reduction thanks to the silicone ear tips, while the H2 chip provides active reduction of louder, intermittent sounds.\nOn the awareness side, Apple introduced a scientifically validated Hearing Test features that lets users check their own hearing from the comfort of their homes, with results securely stored in the Health app and able to be shared with healthcare providers.\nAnd finally, AirPods Pro are becoming the first over-the-counter clinical-grade hearing aid device thanks to personalized audio adjustments created based Hearing Test results. The functionality is available in the United States, UK, Australia, and 100 other countries and regions.\nOther AirPods Features\n- Mute and Unmute - Press on the stem of the AirPods Pro (any model) or AirPods 3, or AirPods 4 to mute and unmute yourself on a call. On AirPods Max, press on the Digital Crown.\n- Automatic Device Switching - Automatic Switching between Apple devices is quicker and more reliable. This is limited to AirPods Pro 2 paired with an iPhone XR/iPhone XS or later.\n- Dark Mode - When connecting the AirPods to the iPhone, if your iPhone is in Dark Mode, the connection popup is also shown in Dark Mode.\nFeatures Coming in iOS 26\nThe upcoming iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS Tahoe updates will add new features to the AirPods when paired with an upcoming AirPods firmware update that will come out alongside the new software.\nStudio Quality Recording\nThe AirPods 4 and the AirPods Pro 2 can be used to record studio-quality audio for interviews, podcasts, songs, videos, and more. Apple says that the feature can be used to record high-quality vocals while on the go.\nYou can record higher-quality audio when making videos or using your devices to do things like record a podcast.\nImproved Audio Quality\nThe studio-quality recording feature brings more natural vocal texture and clarity to iPhone calls, FaceTime calls, and all CallKit-enabled apps like Zoom.\nBoth studio-quality audio recording and improved call quality are available across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and support the Camera app, Voice Memos, Messages dictation, third-party camera apps, and video conferencing apps.\nCamera Remote\nThe AirPods can be used as a camera remote with the Camera app and third-party camera apps on iPhone or iPad. Just press and hold on the AirPods stem to take a photo or start a video recording.\nWhen the recording is finished, a press and hold gesture will stop the recording. Apple says that users who like to capture themselves singing and dancing for social networks like TikTok will be able to easily perform in sync with a soundtrack while simultaneously recording video.\nUpdate Interface\nWith the latest software updates, Apple is finally adding a way to manually update the firmware on your AirPods. When your AirPods are connected, you can go to the Settings app to get to a new software update interface.\nPause Audio for Sleep\nIf you're listening to music, a podcast, or a book while you're in bed and you're wearing AirPods, the AirPods will pause your audio when you fall asleep.\nKeep Audio in Headphones\nWhen you use AirPods, you can opt to keep audio in your headphones when other playback devices like cars and speakers connect to the iPhone.\nBattery Life\nOn their own, the AirPods Pro 2 offer up to six hours of listening time, or 5.5 hours with Spatial Audio and Head Tracking enabled. When used for talking, the battery lasts for a total of 4.5 hours. The AirPods Pro 2 earbuds feature a battery capacity of 49.7 mAh, up 15 percent from 43.2 mAh capacity of the prior-generation AirPods Pro earbuds, which accounts for some of the difference in battery life.\nThe MagSafe Charging Case has a battery capacity of 523 mAh, up just 4 mAh over the prior-generation case. With the MagSafe Charging Case, the AirPods Pro 2 offer up to 30 hours of listening time and 24 hours of talk time before needing to be recharged. Charging can be done using a MagSafe charger, a Lightning cable, a Qi-based charger, or, new this year, the Apple Watch charger.\nApple says that five minutes in the charging case provides the AirPods Pro with one hour of listening time or one hour of talk time.\nFind My\nBoth the AirPods Pro 2 and the MagSafe Charging Case work with the Find My app, so if any component is lost, it can be located using another Apple device. The Charging Case has a U1 chip so it can be tracked down with Precision Finding on a compatible iPhone, and with the new built-in speakers, the case can play a sound so it's easier to find.\nFirmware\nApple regularly updates the software that runs on the AirPods Pro. The current firmware for the AirPods Pro 2 is version 7E93, released in March 2025. The 7E93 firmware added bug fixes and performance improvements. Firmware can be installed by connecting the AirPods Pro to an iPhone, iPad, or Mac, putting them in the case, and charging the case.\nAirPods Pro How Tos\nOther AirPods\nThe AirPods Pro 2 are available alongside the AirPods 4, priced starting at $129, and the over-ear AirPods Max, priced at $549.\nApple's AirPods 4 are similar to the AirPods Pro, but without silicone ear tips. The cheaper model priced at $129 does not offer Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) technology, but the $179 model includes ANC plus a wireless charging case that also includes a speaker for Find My support. The AirPods Max also feature ANC, but are larger over-ear headphones made from aluminum.\nWhat's Next for the AirPods Pro\nApple will introduce a redesigned version of the AirPods Pro in 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Audio quality and design will be refined, with Apple also adding a faster chip. The next-generation AirPods Pro could include \"much better\" Active Noise Cancellation capabilities compared to the AirPods Pro 2, according to rumors. No information about how Apple will improve ANC is available at this time.\nIn February, Apple debuted the Powerbeats Pro 2 with a new heart rate monitoring feature that could eventually come to the AirPods Pro. The Powerbeats Pro 2 uses LED optical sensors that pulse more than 100 times per second to measure heart rate through blood flow. The heart rate monitoring feature works with popular fitness apps, syncing data to Apple Health.\nApple plans to bring this functionality to the AirPods Pro, perhaps in the AirPods Pro 3 that are expected in late 2025. Temperature sensing is also a possibility, and that would set the AirPods Pro apart from the Powerbeats Pro 2.\nThe AirPods Pro will get a refreshed design for both the earbuds and the case, but what the new design will look like remains a mystery. Apple slimmed down the case of the AirPods 4, so it's possible that'll happen with the AirPods Pro too.\nWith the AirPods 4, Apple also removed the setup button on the back of the case, opting instead for a concealed capacitive button. The included LED light is also subtler, and these are also changes we'll likely see for the AirPods Pro.\nThough several rumors suggest that new AirPods Pro will come in 2025, Analyst Jeff Pu says Apple won't launch a new model until 2026.\nFuture Updates\nBased on Apple's patent filings, a future version of the AirPods or AirPods Pro could include a built-in interactive touchscreen display that would let users control audio sources and interact with apps associated with the connected device, though there are no rumors of this technology coming in 2025.\nA future version of the AirPods will include integrated infrared camera modules to improve spatial experiences when paired with the Vision Pro headset. The cameras will work similarly to the Face ID system on the iPhone, scanning the area surrounding the user to better map the environment. The cameras could also provide data for more advanced AI capabilities.\nThe IR cameras will allow for a broader range of gestures that will improve user interaction and the syncing of audio to head movement. The cameras that will be added to the AirPods could also be used to scan the environment and describe objects, similar to the Visual Intelligence feature that's available on newer iPhones.\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes we could see these new AirPods as soon as 2026, but it is not yet clear if the feature will be added to the standard AirPods or a version of the AirPods Pro. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman thinks we could get AirPods with cameras in 2027, so this is another feature not expected in the 2025 refresh.\nAirPods Pro Roundup Changelog\n- July 11 - General maintenance and reorganization.\n- June 27 - Added information on features coming in iOS 26.\n- June 17 - Updated with new rumors.\n- May 15 - Added new rumors about future AirPods Pro.\n- April 17 - Refreshed buyer's guide info.\n- March 31 - Updated with new firmware version.\n- March 25 - Updated hearing health info.\n- March 13 - Added info on future AirPods features, updated buyer's guide info.\n- February 24 - Updated to note Hearing Health is now in the UK."

      "text": "AirPods 4\nApple's fourth-generation AirPods, now with optional active noise cancellation.\nShould You Buy AirPods 4?\nThe AirPods 4 are Apple's latest flagship wireless earbuds, featuring an updated design, more comfortable fit, force sensors, Adaptive EQ, spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, Active Noise Cancellation for the higher-end model, and more. Introduced in September 2024, the AirPods 4 are early in their product cycle, which means now is a good time to buy. Apple does not typically refresh the AirPods annually, and often waits several years before updating.\nThe AirPods 4 and AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation have the same design, but the version without ANC is priced at $129 and the version with ANC is priced $50 higher at $179. The higher price tag also includes a MagSafe Charging Case with Find My integration, but otherwise, the feature set is the same.\n$129 is a competitive price for earbuds, and $179 is the same price as the prior-generation AirPods 3. It is worth noting that the H2 chip inside the AirPods 4 provides a seamless and fully integrated pairing and device-switching experience for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV users, which more affordable headphones from competing companies are unable to match. The H2 chip also enables features like Adaptive EQ and spatial audio with dynamic head tracking. This means that when used with Apple devices, AirPods seem to be the best option for earbuds when it comes to features.\nIf you are looking for AirPods with more to offer like in-ear silicone tips and better Active Noise Cancellation, there are the AirPods Pro which start at $249. For an even higher fidelity AirPods experience and an over-ear design, there are the AirPods Max which start at $549.\n- AirPods 4 vs. AirPods 4 With ANC Buyer's Guide: Which Should You Choose?\n- AirPods 4 With ANC vs. AirPods Pro 2\n- AirPods 4 vs. Previous Generations Buyer's Guide: All Upgrades Compared\nTo get MacRumors readers the best prices on the AirPods, we have a dedicated AirPods deals guide that highlights the best sales each month.\nThe 2024 AirPods 4\nContents\nApple overhauled its AirPods lineup in 2024, introducing the AirPods 4. There are two AirPods 4 models: the standard AirPods 4 and the AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation.\nBoth models have the same design and are identical except for the ANC, though there are a couple of differences with the function of the charging case. Apple revamped the AirPods 4 entirely, introducing a design that is reminiscent of the AirPods Pro with shorter stems, though there are no silicone ear tips.\nAccording to Apple, the AirPods 4 \"set a new benchmark for fit and comfort\" and are the most advanced and comfortable headphones the company has made with an open-ear design. Apple scanned and mapped thousands of ear shapes and used over 50 million data points with 3D photogrammetry and laser topography to create a single shape that naturally fits most users. Apple says that the refined contour offers a natural and secure fit for more people than ever. There is a built-in vent system for pressure equalization.\nThe AirPods 4 have a new acoustic architecture for a massive improvement in sound quality. There's a low-distortion driver and high dynamic range amplifier, plus Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking allows for an immersive media experience. Adaptive EQ tunes music to the user's ears with inward-facing microphones that detect the audio and then adjust low and midrange frequencies to provide rich detail in each song.\nApple used the same H2 chip that's in the AirPods Pro 2 for the AirPods 4. It enables features like Voice Isolation for clearer call quality and Siri Interactions in iOS 18 so you can shake your head no or nod your head yes to respond to Siri announcements. The AirPods 4 are also ideal for gaming, providing low wireless audio latency and good voice quality when chatting with other players.\nThe stem is equipped with a new force sensor that can be used to play or pause media and mute or end calls with a press, plus previous controls for skipping songs and activating Siri are available. An optical in-ear sensor and motion-detecting accelerometer pause music when the AirPods are removed from the ears.\nThe H2 chip, advanced computational audio, and upgraded microphones made the ANC version of the AirPods 4 possible. The AirPods 4 with ANC can reduce environmental noise like airplane engines and city traffic. Transparency Mode is available to keep users aware of their environment, and Adaptive Audio blends Transparency Mode and ANC intelligently based on the user's environment. Conversation Awareness lowers the volume automatically when the user is speaking to someone nearby.\nThe ANC in the AirPods 4 is not as good as the AirPods Pro 2 ANC because of the open-ear design. The AirPods Pro 2 have silicone tips that fit into the ears to shut out outside sound, while the AirPods 4 do not.\nThe AirPods 4 have IP54 dust, sweat, and water resistance so they can hold up to intense workouts and rain.\nApple made the Charging Case over 10 percent smaller in volume than the AirPods 3 case, so it's slimmer and more portable. The case and AirPods add up to a total of 30 hours of battery life without ANC, or 20 hours of battery life with ANC turned on. Talk time is up to 20 hours.\nThe AirPods themselves offer up to five hours of battery life on a single charge without ANC, or four hours with ANC. Five minutes in the charging case provides around one hour of listening time.\nFor both models, the Charging Case has a USB-C port for charging with a USB-C cable (that is not included), but the ANC version of the AirPods 4 case also supports wireless charging with MagSafe chargers, Apple Watch chargers, and Qi and Qi2 chargers. Apple says it is the smallest charging case in the industry that supports wireless charging capabilities.\nThe ANC AirPods 4 Charging Case also has a built-in speaker and support for Find My for keeping track of the AirPods and the case. Both models support Bluetooth 5.3 technology.\nThe AirPods 4 support all of the same \"magic\" setup and use features like one-touch pairing, quick device switching, and support for audio sharing.\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here.\nHow to Buy\nThe standard AirPods 4 are priced at $129, while the version with ANC and wireless Charging Case is priced at $179.\nThe AirPods 4 launched on Friday, September 20, 2024, and can be ordered from the online Apple Store.\nReviews\nThe AirPods 4 reviews have been largely positive, with the standout feature being the optional Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) available for an extra $50. Reviewers note that ANC is a significant upgrade, bringing it closer to the level of the AirPods Pro. With the added bonus of improved Transparency Mode and Adaptive Audio, which adjusts sound based on surroundings, the AirPods 4 deliver a more immersive audio experience than previous generations.\nSound quality is another area where the AirPods 4 shine, with richer bass and clearer highs. The slightly longer battery life and improved fit have been praised, although some users may not find enough reasons to upgrade if they already own AirPods 3 or Pro models. For users of earlier models like the AirPods 2, however, the differences with ANC, fit, and sound performance are substantial.\nRead our AirPods 4 review roundup for more information.\nDesign\nWith the AirPods 4, Apple introduced a new design that's more like the AirPods Pro with a shorter stem and a new, more contoured earpiece. Apple says the AirPods 4 are the best headphones it has made with an open-ear design, setting a \"new benchmark for fit and comfort.\"\nThe updated design was built using advanced modeling tools and real ears. Apple used 3D photogrammetry and laser topography to map and analyze thousands of ear shapes, and it used more than 50 million individual data points in total. As a result, Apple believes the AirPods 4 can fit even more users, with one shape that's super comfortable.\nApple designed the AirPods 4 to be lightweight and to sit at an ideal angle in the ear for comfort and the best possible audio experience. Unlike the AirPods Pro, the AirPods 4 do not have silicone tips and are instead tipless with an open-ear design.\nApple says that the new shape provides a more natural and secure fit to keep the AirPods in the ears.\nThe short stem of the AirPods 4 gives them a subtle look in the ear, similar to the AirPods Pro. A mesh material covers the earpiece, and there's a mesh-covered vent at the back for breathability.\nAs with prior AirPods, the new model is made from a white plastic material with a small bit of silver at the base, along with L and R labeling.\nThe AirPods 4 measure in at 1.19 inches tall (0.2 inches smaller than the prior model), 0.72 inches wide (no change), and 0.71 inches deep (no change). They weigh 4.3 grams, which is essentially unchanged from the prior model.\nStem Gestures\nThe AirPods 4 have a force sensor in the stem that supports multiple gestures.\n- Single press - Play or pause media, answer a call, or mute or unmute.\n- Double press - Skip forward in a playlist or album or end a call.\n- Triple press - Skip back.\n- Press and hold - Activate Siri.\nWater Resistance\nThe AirPods 4 have an IP54 water resistance rating and are able to hold up to dust, sweat, and rain, but they should not be submerged or subjected to heavy amounts of liquid. The Charging Case has the same IP54 water resistance rating.\nApple's warranty does not cover liquid damage, so it's always best to use caution around water and other substances.\nH2 Chip\nThe AirPods 4 are equipped with the same H2 chip that Apple added in the AirPods Pro 2, and it powers all of the available features, including ANC in the more expensive model.\nThe H2 chip also enables the features AirPods have come to be known for, including fast switching between Apple devices that are signed into the same iCloud account, \"Hey Siri\" support, instant pairing, and Audio Sharing, which allows more than one set of AirPods to be paired to a single device.\nAudio\nApple created a new acoustic architecture for the AirPods 4 with a low-distortion driver powered by a custom high dynamic range amplifier. Apple says the AirPods 4 deliver exceptional audio with deeper bass and crystal-clear highs compared to the prior model.\nAdaptive EQ tunes music to your ears, using the inward-facing microphones to detect what you're hearing, then adjusting the low and midrange frequencies to provide rich detail in every song.\nSound Quality\nAccording to Apple, the AirPods 4 bring a massive improvement in sound quality compared to the prior-generation AirPods 3.\nWith low wireless audio latency and high-quality voice features, the AirPods 4 are ideal for gaming.\nCall Quality\nDual beamforming mesh-covered microphones cut down on the sound of the wind and ambient noise to ensure your voice sounds clear to the person on the other end of the call, and support for AAC-ELD offers full HD voice quality for FaceTime calls.\nThe AirPods 4 support Voice Isolation for minimizing background noise while clarifying the sound of your voice, making you easier to understand even when you're speaking in loud or windy conditions.\nPersonalized Spatial Audio\nThe AirPods 4 support personalized spatial audio featuring Dolby Atmos. Apple Music songs, TV shows, and movies can take advantage of spatial audio and it sounds like the audio is coming from all around you when the feature is enabled for an immersive, theater-like experience.\nDynamic head tracking is also available, which makes music, TV, and even Group FaceTime calls more engaging. Spatial audio algorithms and directional audio filters adjust the frequencies that each ear receives, allowing AirPods to produce sound all around the user.\nSpatial audio works with Apple Music and the Apple TV app, but it is also compatible with many third-party apps.\nActive Noise Cancellation\nOne of the two AirPods 4 models includes support for Active Noise Cancellation, and it is the first time that Apple has put it in headphones with an open-ear design. ANC is powered by the H2 chip and the upgraded microphones that are in the AirPods 4.\nWith ANC, the AirPods 4 can cut down on the noise of airplane engines, HVAC systems, city traffic, and more.\nThe ANC is not as good as the ANC in the AirPods Pro 2 because the AirPods Pro have silicone tips to shut out surrounding sound. All of the ANC features are included.\n- Transparency mode - Uses the microphones to relay sounds from the environment around you, so you can stay connected while on a call or listening to music.\n- Adaptive Audio - Blends Transparency and Active Noise Cancellation in real time, tailoring noise control to your environment as it changes.\n- Conversation Awareness - Senses when you're speaking to someone nearby and lowers the volume of what's playing. When you're done speaking, the volume increases.\nAirPods 4 Hardware\nBluetooth\nThe AirPods 4 support the latest Bluetooth 5.3 specification. Bluetooth 5.3 includes enhancements that can improve reliability and energy efficiency.\nSensors\nThere's a motion-detecting accelerometer and a speech detecting accelerometer in the AirPods 4 in addition to an optical in-ear sensor. All of these sensors work together to power AirPods features like ear detection.\nThe optical in-ear sensor is designed to determine whether the AirPods are in the ear versus in a pocket or on a table, with playback pausing when the AirPods are removed from the ear.\nCharging Case\nIn addition to redesigning the AirPods 4, Apple also updated the Charging Case. It's smaller than before, with a 10 percent volume reduction. The case is 1.97 inches wide, 1.82 inches tall, and 0.83 inches deep. The standard model weighs 1.14 ounces, while the ANC version weighs 1.22 ounces.\nApple removed the Setup button from the AirPods 4 case, and instead, there is a hidden capacitive button at the front that can be used for pairing the AirPods 4 and resetting them. The light on the case is also under the plastic and it does not show up unless the case is opened or the AirPods are charging.\nBoth AirPods fit snugly in the case, and an LED on the front lets you know when they're charging. If the light is orange, charging is ongoing, but if it is green, they're fully charged.\nWhen the AirPods are inside the case, the magnetic lid shuts, keeping them in place when the case is in a pocket or a bag. Opening the lid causes the AirPods to connect to an Apple device or initiate pairing.\nThere are two versions of the Charging Case, one for the entry-level AirPods 4 and one for the AirPods 4 with ANC. Both cases have a USB-C port for charging.\nThe case for the more expensive ANC AirPods 4 can charge wirelessly using a MagSafe charger, Qi/Qi2 charger, or an Apple Watch Charger. The ANC AirPods 4 case also has a built-in speaker so it can play a sound to make it easier to find with the Find My app.\nBattery Life\nWithout ANC, the AirPods 4 last for up to five hours on a single charge, or four hours with ANC enabled. One charge provides up to 4.5 hours of talk time.\nThe Charging Case brings total battery life to 30 hours of listening time without ANC, or 20 hours with ANC on. A five minute charge in the case provides around an hour of listening time or 45 minutes of talk time.\nSiri Support\nVolume, song changes, calls, and more can be done with Siri using a \"Hey Siri\" command, which is enabled through the H2 chip. Siri can also announce incoming notifications and let you know what text messages say when you receive them.\nSiri works like it does on any other device, and the voice assistant can answer all manner of questions and perform tasks like adjusting device volume. Some sample Siri commands are listed below.\n- Play some new music\n- Play my \"Favorites\" playlist\n- Skip to the next song\n- Turn down the volume\n- Turn up the volume\n- Call mom\n- Pause my music\n- What's the battery life of my AirPods?\n- What's the temperature outside?\n- What's the battery of my AirPods?\nSiri head gestures are supported, so you can nod your head yes or shake your head no to respond to Siri announcements like incoming notifications and calls.\nFind My\nThe AirPods 4 are part of the Find My network, which leverages hundreds of millions of iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices around the world to find lost items. If your AirPods become lost, you may be able to find them through the Find My network even if they're not close by.\nYou can also set up Separation Alerts that let you know right away if your AirPods are left behind.\nThe AirPods 4 with ANC support Find My alerts thanks to the speaker include in the Charging Case.\niOS 26 Features\nThe upcoming iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS Tahoe updates will add new features to the AirPods when paired with an upcoming AirPods firmware update that will come out alongside the new software. Apple is beta testing the new firmware along with the software updates.\nStudio Quality Recording\nThe AirPods 4 and the AirPods Pro 2 can be used to record studio-quality audio for interviews, podcasts, songs, videos, and more. Apple says that the feature can be used to record high-quality vocals while on the go.\nYou can record higher-quality audio when making videos or using your devices to do things like record a podcast.\nImproved Audio Quality\nThe studio-quality recording feature brings more natural vocal texture and clarity to iPhone calls, FaceTime calls, and all CallKit-enabled apps like Zoom.\nBoth studio-quality audio recording and improved call quality are available across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and support the Camera app, Voice Memos, Messages dictation, third-party camera apps, and video conferencing apps.\nCamera Remote\nThe AirPods can be used as a camera remote with the Camera app and third-party camera apps on iPhone or iPad. Just press and hold on the AirPods stem to take a photo or start a video recording.\nWhen the recording is finished, a press and hold gesture will stop the recording. Apple says that users who like to capture themselves singing and dancing for social networks like TikTok will be able to easily perform in sync with a soundtrack while simultaneously recording video.\nUpdate Interface\nWith the latest software updates, Apple is finally adding a way to manually update the firmware on your AirPods. When your AirPods are connected, you can go to the Settings app to get to a new software update interface.\nPause Audio for Sleep\nIf you're listening to music, a podcast, or a book while you're in bed and you're wearing AirPods, the AirPods will pause your audio when you fall asleep.\nKeep Audio in Headphones\nWhen you use AirPods, you can opt to keep audio in your headphones when other playback devices like cars and speakers connect to the iPhone.\nCurrent Firmware\nApple updates the firmware that runs on the AirPods 4 regularly. The current firmware version is 7E93, and it was released in March. Firmware can be installed on AirPods by connecting them to an Apple device, putting them in their charging case, and waiting for 30 minutes.\nAirPods Pro\nAs an alternative to the AirPods 4, Apple offers the AirPods Pro 2, which are higher-end earbuds with Active Noise Cancellation and silicone ear tips. The AirPods Pro are now on their second generation and are priced at $249, with more information available in our roundup.\nWhat's Next for the AirPods\nFuture AirPods could include multiple health sensors that would complement the Apple Watch. AirPods could include body temperature sensing and posture monitoring, according to The Wall Street Journal. Apple is said to be testing AirPods prototypes that are able to monitor a wearer's core body temperature from within the ear. AirPods could also eventually be used to monitor posture and alert the wearer of slouching using motion sensors.\nA future version of the AirPods will include integrated infrared camera modules to improve spatial experiences when paired with the Vision Pro headset. The cameras will work similarly to the Face ID system on the iPhone, scanning the area surrounding the user to better map the environment.\nThe IR cameras will allow for a broader range of gestures that will improve user interaction and the syncing of audio to head movement, plus the cameras could feed data to an AI feature. The cameras that will be added to the AirPods could also be used to scan the environment and describe objects, similar to the Visual Intelligence feature that's available on newer iPhones.\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes we could see these new AirPods as soon as 2026, but it is not yet clear if the feature will be added to the standard AirPods or a version of the AirPods Pro. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman believes AirPods with cameras will be be released in 2027.\nApple wants to make advanced AR glasses that are based on the Vision Pro headset in the future, but the hardware technology does not exist for such a product as of yet. Apple has instead considered creating a pair of smart glasses that would compete with Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and Amazon's Echo Frames.\nThe glasses could perhaps serve as an AirPods replacement, featuring built-in speakers, cameras, health sensors, and AI capabilities. Apple is still working on the idea and it is not a product that will launch anytime soon.\nAirPods Roundup Changelog\n- July 11 - Revamped iOS 26 feature section.\n- June 27 - Updated with new features coming in iOS 26.\n- May 15 - Added rumors about future AirPods.\n- April 17 - Updated buyer's guide info.\n- March 31 - New firmware released.\n- March 13 - Added rumor about live translate coming to AirPods in iOS 19.\n- January 28 - Updated with rumors about future AirPods, and added firmware installation instructions.\n- November 15 - New firmware released.\n- October 2 - Added new buyer's guide.\n- September 30 - Added new video comparison with AirPods Pro 2.\n- September 27 - New firmware released.\n- September 19 - Updated with reviews and buyer's guide.\n- September 11 - Revamped with AirPods 4 launch info."

      "text": "CarPlay Overview\nContents\nAt its core, CarPlay is Apple's way of bringing iOS to in-car infotainment systems and dashboards. It's designed to display information from the iPhone on a car's built-in infotainment unit, giving drivers a safe way to make phone calls, send text messages, listen to music, and access Maps -- all of the things a driver might want to do with an iPhone while driving a car.\nWhen connected to an in-dash system via the iPhone's Lightning/USB-C port or wirelessly in some cars, CarPlay gives the user in-car access to information stored on the iPhone, like contacts for phone calls and messages, music playlists and controls, Maps for navigation, calendar events, and more. Because CarPlay pulls its information from the iPhone, there's virtually no setup involved.\nAutomobile manufacturers have been building CarPlay support into cars since 2015, but there's also a way to get CarPlay in existing vehicles -- many aftermarket in-dash systems from companies like Sony, Pioneer, Kenwood, and Alpine are compatible with CarPlay and are readily available at reasonable prices. Porsche has even created an aftermarket system for Porsche models dating as far back as the 1960s. More than 800 models in the United States offer CarPlay, which covers most car manufacturers.\nCarPlay is designed to be largely hands-free, introducing as little driver distraction as possible, and for that reason, it is voice-based and reliant on Apple's personal assistant Siri. Siri is used to perform a range of actions in the car, like placing phone calls, getting directions, sending and reading text messages, playing music, accessing apps, and more.\nThere are physical controls in the form of buttons and knobs that can activate Siri for CarPlay purposes, but these controls vary from vehicle to vehicle, based on how each manufacturer has implemented them. Systems with touch screens are able to accommodate touch-based input as well, and special adapters can enhance in-car integration of aftermarket CarPlay solutions.\niOS already offers a consistent Apple experience across tablets and smartphones, but with CarPlay, that's also extended to the car in an easy-to-use format that people are already familiar with. CarPlay has an updated, modernized design that features rounded corners, table views, and a status bar, with the design mirroring what you see on the iPhone. The CarPlay Dashboard offers up easier access to maps, audio controls, and Siri Suggestions, plus there's a useful design for the Calendar app that makes it easy to see the day's events at a glance.\nApple Music includes album art in Now Playing and updated discovery tools, and when you activate Siri, Siri only takes up part of the screen so you can still see the rest of the CarPlay interface. Apple Maps is available persistently on the dashboard, even when there are points of interest, and many Maps features are available in CarPlay, such as route planning, search, and navigation, along with a Junction View that offers up a clear picture of intersections and the lane you need to be in.\nThere's a light mode that's an alternative to the traditional dark mode, and there's a settings app for changing display options and Do Not Disturb settings. CarPlay supports customizable wallpapers, so you can choose a new look for the CarPlay Dashboard and Home Screen. Cars with portrait screens also have the option of a status bar on the bottom of the CarPlay display, for wider app views and a more natural layout.\nAdditional app categories are supported, so CarPlay users can download third-party parking, EV charging (including the ChargePoint app with CarPlay integration), and quick food ordering apps. Siri in CarPlay can send audio messages and share ETAs with friends and family, among other features.\nBecause CarPlay is a rather ambitious effort requiring the cooperation of automobile makers and third-party hardware companies, it was initially slow to get off the ground, but currently, a whole range of CarPlay-enabled vehicles are available and CarPlay support is increasingly common in new vehicles.\nApple has even introduced a next-generation version of CarPlay with deeper integration with vehicles, called CarPlay Ultra. CarPlay Ultra includes multi-display support, integration with in-car instrument clusters, access to a vehicle's climate controls, widget support, an FM radio app, and more.\nThe first vehicles with next-generation CarPlay support were announced in late 2023, and the first vehicle with CarPlay Ultra debuted in May 2025.\nCarPlay Ultra\nIn May 2025, Apple finally unveiled its next-generation version of CarPlay, CarPlay Ultra. Available in Aston Martin vehicles to begin with, CarPlay Ultra will expand to other vehicle manufacturers over time. Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis, for example, have pledged future support.\nWith CarPlay Ultra, Apple's aim is to provide the \"ultimate in-car experience\" with deeper integration with the vehicle to provide the best of the iPhone and the best of the car. CarPlay Ultra expands across all of the driver's screens, displaying real-time content and gauges in the instrument cluster, while also continuing to reflect the automaker's look and feel.\nImproved Integration\nCarPlay Ultra displays content on all of the screens in a car, including the instrument cluster, offering up a custom look for the speedometer, tachometer, fuel gauge, temperature gauge, and more, for a more consistent look and feel across the vehicle.\nDrivers can opt to show information from their iPhone like Maps and media right alongside information from the car, such as advanced driver assistance systems and tire pressure, in the instrument cluster.\nControls\nDrivers can use onscreen controls, physical buttons, or Siri to manage standard vehicle functions like the radio's car and climate, as well as vehicle-specific features and controls like performance settings right from CarPlay, rather than having separate control systems like the original version of CarPlay.\nWidgets\nCarPlay Ultra supports widgets that are powered by iPhone, with the widgets designed to fit the car's screen or gauge cluster to provide useful information at a glance.\nPer-Vehicle Customization\nWith CarPlay Ultra, car manufacturers are able to customize the experience so that the overall look and feel matches with the design philosophy used for the vehicle. Apple works with each automaker's design team to create custom themes, for an experience that's tailor-made for each vehicle.\nDrivers are also able to personalize the colors and wallpapers of themes to match their tastes.\nCarPlay Classic\nThe standard CarPlay interface that Apple has been using since 2015 is designed to be immediately familiar to anyone who has used iOS on an iPhone or iPad. Connecting an iPhone to CarPlay through a Lightning or USB-C cable brings up an iOS-style interface on the in-car display that offers a home screen complete with apps like Maps, Phone, Messages, Music, Podcasts, and several third-party offerings. Wireless connectivity is also available in some vehicles, eliminating the need to connect a cable each time you get in the car.\nApps are accessed via touch screen, through Siri, or through various in-car controls that might be located on the steering wheel, center console, or other location depending on the car manufacturer. On aftermarket offerings from companies like Pioneer and Alpine, physical controls are limited to buttons on the in-dash system unless special adapters are installed.\nThough apps can be launched through touch-based controls, actions like sending a text message, making a phone call, or changing a music track are largely conducted through Siri. There is no on-screen keyboard for most functions, for example, so text messages are transcribed by voice much as they are when using dictation to send messages on an iPhone. More information on the included CarPlay apps and what they do can be found below.\nApple CarPlay Apps\nMaps: Powered by the Apple Maps app on the iPhone, Maps within CarPlay lets users get detailed turn-by-turn directions to help them navigate. The CarPlay interface clearly displays the route, driving instructions, traffic conditions, and visual cues for upcoming turns. Estimated time of arrival is also included, along with an estimate of driving time and distance until the destination is reached.\nMaps draws in location information from apps like Messages, Calendar, and Mail, and it also includes previous searches made on iOS. For example, if a user has a specific location for an upcoming meeting stored in the Calendar app, Maps pulls that info into the CarPlay interface. Maps also allows for voice commands through Siri, so it's possible to ask Siri to find a gas station, a museum, or a specific address. Maps supports traffic alerts and can provide alternate routes to save time in traffic-heavy areas.\nOn select electric vehicles, Maps on iPhone and CarPlay supports EV routing, monitoring your vehicle's charge status and suggesting appropriate charging stations along your route. For select charging providers, you can even see real-time charging station availability.\nCarPlay also supports third-party Maps apps like Google Maps, giving CarPlay users an alternative to Apple Maps. Many map apps have since added CarPlay support, including Google Maps, Waze, and others.\nPhone: With the Phone app, it's possible to ask Siri to dial calls, return missed calls, and listen to voice mail. The CarPlay Phone app also has a keypad so numbers can be punched in on the touchscreen, but for the most part, calls can be initiated by asking Siri to dial an existing contact.\nA user might say, \"Call mom,\" for example, to place a phone call over the car's speaker system. In-car controls are also used alongside the touchscreen for functions like muting calls or initiating conference calls.\nMessages: As with phone calls, sending a message is reliant on Siri. Messages are dictated aloud to the voice assistant, with Siri confirming the content of the message to ensure accuracy before sending. When a response is received, Siri asks if the user wants it read aloud and then gives the option to send another text message, with the entire interaction being voice-based to prevent users from looking at their iPhones while driving.\nSample commands within the Messages app include \"Read message from Kelly,\" or \"Send message to mom,\" followed by the message content.\nAudiobooks: The Audiobooks app is part of the Books app and lets users listen to audiobooks in their vehicles.\nApple Music: The CarPlay Music app allows customers to access content that has been downloaded from iTunes, the Apple Music streaming service, and the free Beats 1 radio station. Like other CarPlay apps, the Music app's interface is immediately recognizable, with access to Artists, Songs, and Playlists. With Siri, it's possible for Apple Music subscribers to play a specific songs or artists on-demand with commands like \"Siri, play Beyonce.\"\nWith SharePlay, everyone in the car can contribute to a playlist, and support for Spatial Audio and Dolby Atmos allows car manufacturers to build more immersive sound experiences.\nPodcasts: With the Podcasts app, CarPlay users can listen to their downloaded podcasts. The CarPlay interface is similar to the interface on iOS devices and should be immediately familiar to those who frequently use the Podcasts app.\nCalendar: Apple's native Calendar app gives you a glanceable look at your daily schedule while also allowing you to get directions to appointments or dial in to meetings with just a tap.\nThe Calendar app also integrated into the Dashboard view, offering convenient access to the most immediately upcoming events at relevant times.\nNews: The News app lets you listen to Apple News Today audio briefings, with Apple News+ subscribers having access additional features like audio versions of select news stories.\nThird-Party CarPlay Apps\nApple also lets third-party developers create dedicated apps for CarPlay. Available apps are generally audio-focused and largely non-visual, in order to avoid introducing distractions into the car, with the content being played through the car's speakers.\nThird-party apps only show up on the CarPlay display if the app is installed on the iPhone. So, for example, if a user regularly listens to Spotify on the iPhone and has the Spotify app installed, Spotify is also available via the CarPlay interface.\nBecause of the audio-focused restriction, there are a limited number of apps that are compatible with CarPlay, but there are many podcast, maps, music, and communication apps that work with CarPlay. In recent years, Apple has expanded the types of supported CarPlay apps to include categories such as fueling/EV charging, parking, and quick food ordering.\nCarPlay Reviews\nWe've done a number of reviews of different CarPlay-enabled vehicles, all of which can be found below. CarPlay itself is essentially the same across various cars, but every manufacturer has a unique implementation due to the differences between infotainment systems, ranging from screen sizes and aspect ratios to control methods and other details.\nCarPlay Partners\nCarPlay is available in over 800 cars dating back nearly a decade, with manufacturers like Cadillac, Chevrolet, Fiat-Chrysler, Ford, GMC, Honda, Kia, Lincoln, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Volvo, Nissan, BMW, Hyundai, Porsche, Toyota, Volkswagen, Infiniti, and more offering CarPlay-equipped vehicles that are available now. Even semi trucks are gaining CarPlay support, with Volvo introducing its CarPlay-equipped VNL series trucks, and select manufacturers like Honda, Indian Motorcycle, and Slingshot have even introduced motorcycles with CarPlay support.\nApple has an official master list of all the CarPlay vehicles available in the United States and other countries. For those in search of a CarPlay-equipped vehicle, Apple's list is the best way to determine the options that are available. It is updated on a regular basis to add new models, but may not include new CarPlay vehicles as soon as they are announced. For that reason, the CarPlay Timeline at the bottom of this roundup is also a good resource for finding news on CarPlay vehicles as soon as they're announced.\nApple's list includes over 800 2014\u20132025 models from nearly all vehicle manufacturers, and additional automobile manufacturers are adding support on a regular basis, though there a few holdouts like Tesla and Rivian that want to maintain control over the infotainment experience. Longtime CarPlay supporter GM is even phasing out support for the feature in its new EVs, claiming greater safety and tighter integration by forcing users to stay in the native infotainment system.\nAftermarket Systems\nAlpine, Kenwood, Pioneer, JVC, JBL, and Sony all sell various aftermarket CarPlay systems for installation in vehicles that do not come standard with the feature. The aftermarket systems generally retail for between $400 and $1,400 depending on the model, and can usually be retrofitted into older vehicles for relatively minimal costs.\nAftermarket CarPlay systems works similarly to CarPlay systems installed in new vehicles, but they may lack some of the built-in vehicle controls at the steering wheel and in other locations. Aftermarket systems were some of the first CarPlay implementations and companies like Pioneer and Kenwood have been producing them for several years, though they have become less practical in newer vehicles as built-in infotainment systems have become more powerful and control more of the vehicles' functionality.\nCarPlay in iOS 26\nWith iOS 26, CarPlay is getting a new Liquid Glass design. The look includes layered glass-like app icons and translucent user interface elements.\nNew Messages App Features\nStarting with iOS 26, you can respond to messages with standard Tapbacks like a heart, thumbs up, or exclamation marks directly through CarPlay.\nCarPlay also now displays pinned conversations in the Messages app.\nPhone Calls\nApple added a compact view for incoming phone calls, so that you can still see other information on the screen, such as turn-by-turn directions.\nLive Activities and Widgets\nCarPlay's Dashboard screen can now show Live Activities, letting you keep track of things like a flight's arrival time at a glance.\nThe regular version of CarPlay also now has a widgets screen, for things like calendar appointments and HomeKit accessory controls.\nOther New Features\n- Multi-Touch Maps - Starting with iOS 26, CarPlay users can interact with mapping apps using multi-touch gestures in supported vehicles. This allows users to zoom and pan on the map with their fingers, just like they can on an iPhone.\n- Watch Videos While Parked - iPhone users can wirelessly stream videos to the CarPlay screen using AirPlay, according to Apple. For safety reasons, video playback will only be available when the vehicle is parked, to prevent distracted driving. The connected iPhone will be able to detect when the vehicle is in motion and end playback. Automakers need to add support for this feature, so it might be limited to newer vehicles and take some time to roll out.\n- Smart Display Zoom - iOS 26 adds a new Smart Display Zoom setting to CarPlay. When the setting is enabled, CarPlay will be automatically resized to better fit the shape and size of your vehicle's dashboard screen, if possible.\nWireless CarPlay\nSince iOS 9, Apple has supported wireless CarPlay implementations. Many CarPlay setups require an iPhone to be plugged in directly to the in-dash system to connect, but wireless CarPlay alleviates the need for a Lightning or USB-C cable, allowing an iPhone to connect to an in-car system wirelessly.\nBMW was the first car manufacturer to implement wireless CarPlay support, in 2016, but over the years, many other car manufacturers have adopted the feature, such as Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, Mitsubishi, Ford, Fiat Chrysler, GM, Hyundai, Honda, and more, but it is not yet universal.\nAlpine and Pioneer also both make aftermarket wireless CarPlay systems, which do not require an iPhone to be plugged in to the car, instead using Wi-Fi.\nMany users still prefer to plug their phones in for CarPlay, ensuring a more stable connection with less potential for lag while also allowing for device charging on longer trips, though many vehicles are now equipped with wireless chargers that can make it convenient to keep your phone topped off without needing to plug it in.\nCompatible Devices\nCarPlay is compatible with all modern iPhones. CarPlay does not work with the iPad in part because cellular connectivity is required and certain iPhone-exclusive functionality like the Phone app are key to the CarPlay experience. While some iPad models do support cellular connectivity, Apple has not made its tablets compatible with CarPlay.\nAvailable Countries\nCarPlay is available in 36 countries, including Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the United States. Not all features are available in all countries, however."

      "text": "In 2007, Apple launched the original iPhone, kickstarting the modern smartphone era which is now dominated by iPhone and Android devices. We've had 18 generations of iPhones so far, with the latest models, the iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, introduced in September 2024, and the iPhone 16e released in February 2025. Apple follows an annual update cycle, introducing new flagship models while discounting prior-year models and selling them at more affordable price points.\niPhone vs Android\nOver the years, Android and iPhone smartphones have evolved to the point where feature-wise, they're similar in function and capability. Android smartphones are made by multiple manufacturers, but the core operating system is provided by Google, which leads to a wider variety of phones and price points to choose from, but weaker integration between software and hardware.\nApple's control of both the iPhone and the operating system (iOS) provides a more consistent experience along with ongoing support. With iOS 18, Apple supports all iPhones that were introduced in the last four years, so the majority of active iPhone owners can and do upgrade to the newest version of iOS that Apple rolls out each year.\nAndroid updates are often more inconsistent and often don't make it to all Android-based smartphones because each manufacturer has to implement support on an individual basis. So while Google also does yearly Android updates, the reality is that a lot of older Android smartphones don't get the new software.\nWith Apple's control and curation of the iPhone experience, the iPhone is largely considered to be the more secure platform, and Apple has made it a point to focus heavily on privacy. Apple's iOS is less customizable than Android, though, so for individuals who prefer flexibility and customization options, the Android operating system may be worth looking at.\nHow Do iPhone Updates Work?\nHere are the basics you should know about how Apple updates the iPhone and the iOS operating system.\nEach fall, typically in September, Apple releases a new series of flagship smartphones. These often come at high prices and feature the latest technologies, with Apple offering high-end models and still high-end but more affordable models. Prior-year iPhones often stick around with lower price points as cheaper alternatives to the latest and greatest technology, and occasionally, Apple launches a lower-cost iPhone outside of the normal fall timeline.\nAt the current time, Apple's iPhone lineup includes the iPhone 15 (2023), iPhone 15 Plus (2023), iPhone 16 (2024), iPhone 16 Plus (2024), iPhone 16 Pro (2024), iPhone 16 Pro Max (2024), and iPhone 16e (2025).\nApple also debuts an updated version of iOS at the same time that new iPhones launch, but new versions of iOS are pre-introduced every year at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference to give developers time to incorporate new features and technologies into their apps ahead of when the software becomes available to the public. The current iPhones run iOS 18.\nIn this guide, we go over all of the iPhones that are in the current Apple lineup, offer up some buying suggestions, and provide tips and resources for both new and existing iPhone owners.\niPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max ($999+)\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are Apple's current high-end flagship devices with all of the top-of-the-line features and the most bells and whistles. The Pro models are for those who want to get the most out of their iPhones with the latest feature set.\nPricing on the iPhone 16 Pro starts at $999, while pricing on the iPhone 16 Pro Max starts at $1,199. The two iPhones are nearly identical when it comes to feature set, and it's only display size and battery capacity that set the two devices apart.\nApple introduced larger screen sizes and slimmed down bezels for the Pro lineup in 2024, so the iPhone 16 Pro Max has a larger 6.9-inch display (up from 6.7 inches), and the iPhone 16 Pro has a 6.3 inch display (up from 6.1 inches). Both models feature the same design with a glass front and back, a lightweight but durable titanium frame, and squircle edges. Colors this year include natural titanium, white titanium, black titanium, and desert titanium, which is a shade of gold.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max feature edge-to-edge OLED displays with the slimmest bezels we've seen in an iPhone to date. There's a second-generation \"Ceramic Shield\" that offers superior scratch resistance, and a pill-shaped Dynamic Island continues to house the front-facing camera and hardware used for Face ID authentication.\nThe customizable Action button is still available, and it now does more thanks to Control Center integration. This year, Apple also added a Camera Control button that can be used to activate the camera with a press. Camera Control makes it quicker to capture photos and videos, and it is also pressure and touch sensitive so you can change controls and adjust settings without touching the screen.\nThe Dynamic Island has been incorporated into the iPhone's interface and it is able to show various notifications and app information for phone calls, timers, Face ID, Bluetooth connections, and more.\nApple added a new A18 Pro chip to the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, with a 6-core CPU, a 6-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine. It is up to 20 percent faster than the A17 Pro from the iPhone 15 Pro models, and it is the fastest iPhone for Apple Intelligence.\nThere continues to be a three-lens camera setup with a 48-megapixel Main camera that offers improved low-light performance, a 12-megapixel 5x Telephoto lens, and a new 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera. The 5x Telephoto is available for both Pro models, which is new this year, and the 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera takes improved wide-angle and macro shots when lighting is poor.\nCrash Detection is able to determine if you've been in a serious car accident, alerting emergency services, and there's also an Emergency SOS via satellite feature for getting help if you're out of range of Wi-Fi and cellular. With iOS 18, the satellite connectivity can be used to send messages too.\nBoth iPhone 16 Pro models offer improvements to battery life, and they have a USB-C port and support for up to 25W MagSafe charging.\nOther features include IP68 water resistance, 8GB RAM, ProMotion 120Hz refresh rate for the display, faster 5G, a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, faster USB-C charging, and Wi-Fi 7.\nKey Features:\n- Highest end, highest price\n- Triple-lens camera: Main (Wide), Ultra Wide, and Telephoto (5x for the Max)\n- 48-megapixel Main lens with ProRAW support\n- 48-megapixel Ultra Wide lens with macro capability\n- Camera Control button\n- A18 Pro chip\n- Action button\n- Always-On Display\n- Titanium frame\nBottom Line: The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max are the iPhones to choose if you want the absolute best camera capabilities that you can get in an iPhone, with the Pro Max being the top-of-the-line model due to its increased display size, and longer battery life. In terms of performance, there isn't much of a difference between the iPhone 16 Pro models and the standard iPhone 16 models, with screen size, display quality, and chassis material differentiating the two iPhone lines.\niPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus ($799+)\nSold alongside the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus are Apple's more affordable flagship devices. The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus feature many of the same capabilities as the Pro models, but they are missing some of the higher-end features to keep the price lower. The 6.1-inch iPhone 16 is priced starting at $799, while the 6.7-inch iPhone 16 Plus is priced starting at $899.\nDespite the difference in screen size, the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus are essentially identical, featuring a flat-edged design with a glass body and an aluminum frame. They do not offer ProMotion display technology and thus do not support an always-on display, but they do have the same Dynamic Island, front-facing camera, and Face ID authentication functionality.\nApple brought the Action button to the iPhone 16 lineup this year, so that is no longer a Pro-only feature. The Action button replaces the Ring/Silent switch, and it is customizable, so you can set it to bring up whatever is most convenient for you. It can mute/unmute your iPhone, activate the flashlight, open a favorite app, activate a Control Center control, turn on a Focus mode, and more.\nLike the iPhone 16 Pro models, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus have a new Camera Control button below the power button. Pressing the button activates the camera, and a double press snaps a photo, so it makes it much quicker to get the shot that you want. The button is capacitive and pressure sensitive, so it can be used for changing various camera settings and swapping between tools. It works much like a DSLR shutter for autofocus with a half press, and you can adjust exposure, style, zoom, aperture, and more without ever touching the iPhone's display.\nWhile the iPhone 16 Pro models have an A18 Pro chip, the iPhone 16 models have an almost-as-capable A18 chip that also works with Apple Intelligence. The A18 has the same 6-core CPU and 16-core Neural Engine, but it has a 5-core GPU instead of a 6-core GPU. The chip is built using the same 3-nanometer technology, and it enables support for ray tracing and console-quality games, a feature that was previously limited to the Pro models. Battery life has improved compared to the prior iPhone 15 models thanks to the new chip technology.\nThere is a dual camera system that features 12-megapixel Ultra Wide and 48-megapixel Fusion (Wide) lenses with no Telephoto lens. The primary camera can be cropped in to a 2x zoom, so 0.5, 1x, and 2x options are supported. Some of the same photography and videography capabilities that are in the Pro models are also in the standard iPhone 16 models, including the new Photographic Styles for customizing your images and Audio Mix for adjusting the sound in your videos, plus support for shooting spatial videos and images.\nCapturing video in 4K at 120 frames per second is a Pro-only feature, as is support for shooting in ProRAW and ProRes, so if those are capabilities you need, you'll want to look at the Pro models.\nThe iPhone 16 models have support for mmWave (U.S. only) and Sub-6GHz 5G, and they also have a USB-C port and offer MagSafe charging at up to 25W, a new, faster speed this year. Crash Detection, Emergency SOS via satellite, and Messages via satellite are available as well. Compared to the Pro models, the standard models lack the titanium chassis, the Telephoto camera lens, and the A18 Pro chip.\nKey Features:\n- Dual-lens camera: Fusion (Wide), Ultra Wide\n- Crash Detection\n- USB-C port\n- Action button\n- Camera Control\n- A18 chip\nBottom Line: The iPhone 16 and 16 Plus offer many of the same features as the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max at a more affordable price, and these are the iPhones that we recommend for most people. The differences are limited primarily to the camera and the display, and may not be of interest for those who are not heavily invested in iPhone photography, making the $200+ savings worth it for most. Older iPhones are another option to save money, but be aware that only the four iPhone 16 models and the prior-generation iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max support Apple Intelligence.\niPhone 16e ($599+)\nPriced starting at $599, the iPhone 16e is similar in design to the iPhone 16, but it is actually modeled after the iPhone 14. It has an all-display design with Face ID, but it has an older-style notch rather than a Dynamic Island.\nThe iPhone 16e has a 6.1-inch OLED display like the iPhone 16, and it has the same 8GB RAM and A18 chip that supports Apple Intelligence, though there is one less GPU core. It is the first iPhone with Apple's new C1 modem, which is more efficient than Qualcomm's comparable X71 modem in the iPhone 16. While there is no mmWave 5G support, there seems to be no compromise to the more widespread sub-6GHz Wi-Fi speeds.\nThere is a single-lens rear camera in the iPhone 16e, and it is the same as the 48-megapixel Wide camera in the iPhone 16. It can take 1x and 2x photos, but there is no 0.5x option and no 5x zoom as there is in the iPhone 16 Pro models.\nThe iPhone 16e has the longest battery life of any 6.1-inch iPhone, and the battery lasts for up to 26 hours when watching video. It charges via USB-C, but it does not support MagSafe and wireless charging is limited to 7.5W. Not being able to use MagSafe is one of the main downsides to the iPhone 16e.\nIt is also worth noting that there is no Ultra Wideband chip for Precision Finding in the Find My app, and it is limited to Wi-Fi 6, so it will not connect to the 6GHz networks available with Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7 routers.\nOther features include Crash Detection, Emergency SOS via Satellite, and Messages via Satellite, but these are also features available with other iPhone 16 models.\nKey Features:\n- Face ID\n- A18 chip\n- Lower price\nBottom Line: The iPhone 16e is now Apple's lowest-price iPhone, and it is worthwhile if you can live without a dual-lens camera system, faster Wi-Fi connectivity, and MagSafe. It has many of the same features as the iPhone 16 at a $200 lower price point.\niPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus ($699+)\nThe iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are Apple's prior-generation flagship devices that are now being sold at a discount. They have older technology and are lacking some of the new features that Apple introduced with the iPhone 16 models, including the Camera Control button, the faster A-series chip, the Action button, and, most importantly, support for Apple Intelligence. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus cannot run the new Apple Intelligence features in iOS 18, so only consider Apple's prior-generation iPhones if that is not important to you.\nThe iPhone 15 models don't look notably different from the iPhone 16 models, except for the color options. Apple did not make major design changes, but the iPhone 15 models do not have a Camera Control button and they have a Ring/Silent switch instead of an Action button. There's also a diagonal rear camera setup that does not offer some of the newer camera capabilities like Photographic Styles for customizing the look of your images or Audio Mix for tweaking the sound in your videos.\nWhile the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus don't support some of the newer software-based camera features, the hardware is largely the same. There's a Main (Wide) lens that supports 1x and 2x zoom, and an Ultra Wide lens. There is no dedicated Telephoto lens.\nThe iPhone 15 measures in at 6.1 inches, while the iPhone 15 Plus is 6.7 inches. The two devices are essentially identical, with a Dynamic Island for Face ID, aluminum frames, and OLED screen technology. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus have an older A16 chip that is two generations behind the newer chips in the current flagship models.\nThe iPhone 15 models have support for mmWave (U.S. only) and Sub-6GHz 5G and use the X70 Qualcomm chip, one generation behind the Qualcomm chip in the new iPhones. Battery life is a little shorter, but the iPhone 15 models do support MagSafe and USB-C. There is no support for the faster 25W MagSafe charging, though, with the iPhone 15 models limited to 15W MagSafe charging.\nBetween the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, the features are identical with the exception of screen size and battery, as the iPhone 15 Plus can accommodate a larger battery size.\nKey Features:\n- Diagonal dual-lens camera: Main (Wide), Ultra Wide\n- Crash Detection\n- USB-C port\n- Dynamic Island\n- 5G support\n- A16 chip\nBottom Line: The iPhone 15 and 15 Plus are solid devices that will perform well at an affordable price, but keep in mind that the iPhone 16 is such a notable upgrade that it may be worth paying $100 more for the iPhone 16 this year. The iPhone 15 models do not have an Action button or a Camera Control button, and they cannot run the Apple Intelligence features in iOS 18, so you'd be missing out on the more capable Siri, customizable emoji, Writing Tools, and other Apple Intelligence functions. A prior-generation iPhone is usually a good way to save money, but this year, we don't recommend it.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThere's no one single iPhone that's best for everyone, and picking the right smartphone needs to take into account factors like budget, desired battery life, preferred feature set, and more.\nIf you want the absolute best photographic capabilities for example, you're going to want the iPhone 16 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro Max, and if you want something that has a solid feature set at a great price, the iPhone 16e is what you'll want to look at.\nBelow, we've outlined some of the best iPhone choices based on different scenarios or features that you might be looking for.\nWhich iPhone Has the Best Battery Life?\nWith the efficient A18 Pro chip, the iPhone 16 Pro Max has the longest battery life for any iPhone to date at up to 33 hours when watching videos. The iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Plus are second and will last up to 27 hours when watching videos. The iPhone 16e lasts for up to 26 hours when watching videos, and it is the smallest of the bunch at 6.1 inches.\nWhich iPhone Has the Best Camera?\nWith their updated triple-lens camera systems, 48-megapixel Fusion lens, 5x Telephoto lens, 48-megapixel Ultra Wide lens, and LiDAR Scanners, the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max have the best iPhone cameras that you can get. Both of the new iPhones include a three-lens camera system with the same feature set. This year, the Ultra Wide lens has been upgraded to 48 megapixels, allowing for more detailed wide-angle and macro shots.\nThe Fusion lens supports 24-megapixel and 48-megapixel high-resolution photos through the Photonic Engine, and the Ultra Wide lens supports 12-megapixel images that have the detail from the combined pixels of the 48-megapixel resolution. Using computational photography, the Fusion camera can be set to 24mm, 28mm, and 35mm focal lengths to better mirror what's possible with DSLRs.\nAll four iPhone 16 models have a new Camera Control button that makes it easier to capture a photo or a video with just a couple of button presses, and the Camera Control button is also capacitive and pressure sensitive so it can be used for changing photography modes and adjusting settings, which makes your iPhone feel more like a camera.\nWhich iPhone Has Touch ID?\nUnfortunately, none of Apple's iPhones have Touch ID. It has been phased out, and Face ID is the only option.\nWhich iPhone is Best For One-Handed Use?\nThe iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16e both measure in at 6.1 inches, and they are the smallest iPhones that Apple makes. They won't work for one-handed use for everyone, but they are a better option than the 16 Plus and 16 Pro Max.\nWhich iPhone is the Best Value?\nWith Apple Intelligence support, a 48-megapixel camera, OLED display, and 5G connectivity for $599, the iPhone 16e is the best deal that Apple offers. If you need faster mmWave 5G speeds, Wi-Fi 7 connectivity, MagSafe, and an Ultra Wide camera, the $799 iPhone 16 is the upgrade option.\nIf you don't need the latest bells and whistles like Apple Intelligence and don't mind losing out on a bit of performance and battery life, the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus, which are $100 cheaper than than their iPhone 16 counterparts, could be worth considering.\nFor many people, the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16e are the iPhones to get this year with their lower price point and modern feature set.\nWhich iPhone Has the Most Features?\nIf you want the iPhone with the most bells and whistles, that's the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max. These iPhones offer OLED displays, triple-lens cameras, glass bodies with titanium steel frames, larger maximum storage capacities, and longer battery life.\nCompared to the iPhone 16 models, the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max have better camera capabilities. The absolute best would be the iPhone 16 Pro Max because of its larger display and bigger battery.\nIn More Detail\nStill not sure? We have deeper dives comparing the iPhone 16 models to each other and to the prior-generation iPhone models, and the standard iPhone 16 to the Pro.\n- iPhone 16 vs. iPhone 16 Pro Buyer's Guide: All Differences Compared\n- iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 16 Buyer's Guide: 30+ Upgrades Compared\n- iPhone 15 Pro vs. iPhone 16 Pro Buyer's Guide: 45+ Upgrades Compared\n- iPhone 15 vs. iPhone 16e Buyer's Guide: 25+ Differences Compared\n- iPhone 16e vs. iPhone 16 Buyer's Guide: 25+ Differences Compared\nFor full details on each phone, explore our roundups:\nUpcoming iPhone Rumors\nApple is working on new iPhone 17 models that will come out in the fall of 2025. This lineup will do away with the \"Plus\" iPhone, with Apple instead planning to release an \"Air\" or \"Slim\" model that is thinner and more expensive. It will be sold alongside the standard iPhone 17, the iPhone 17 Pro, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max.

If you were expecting iOS 19 after iOS 18, you might be a little surprised to see Apple jump to iOS 26, but the new number reflects the 2025-2026 release season for the software update. It also lets Apple use the same number across all of its updates, so there's no more confusion since you're no longer downloading iOS, macOS, visionOS, and watchOS all with different numbers.\niOS 26 brings the first new major design change that Apple has brought to iOS since iOS 7. Apple says that the new \"Liquid Glass\" look will be the basis of the next decade of iOS design. Liquid Glass reflects and refracts its surroundings, while putting more focus on content. Many interface elements are almost entirely translucent, and the design extends to controls, navigation, app icons, menus, buttons, and widgets.\nLiquid Glass is meant to transform depending on content or context, and it behaves like glass in the real world, so color is informed by its surroundings, and it is meant to adapt between light and dark elements. Liquid Glass uses real-time rendering and can dynamically react to movement to change the way that light reflects off of buttons, switches, sliders, side bars, tab bars, and more.\nYou'll see Liquid Glass throughout iOS 26, in all of Apple's apps, in notifications, on the Lock Screen, in Control Center, and on the Home Screen. Apple is also providing developers with tools to bring the new material to their own apps for a cohesive look. Liquid Glass also extends to iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe, visionOS 26, tvOS 26, and watchOS 26.\nThe Liquid Glass design overhaul isn't just a glossy finish, it also brings updates to the design of controls, toolbars, and navigation throughout iOS 26. App windows, menu bars, and other interface elements have more rounded corners, and controls feature a distinct functional layer designed to sit above apps. These kinds of menus can dynamically morph to provide users with more options in an app.\nWhen scrolling, tab bars shrink down to bring attention to content, but scrolling up brings them right back for fluid navigation. When tab bars are active, they refract the content around them. There are major Liquid Glass design updates for Camera, Photos, Safari, FaceTime, Apple Music, and Apple Podcasts. On the Lock Screen, the Liquid Glass time expands and shrinks to fit behind the subject of a wallpaper, and on the Home Screen, app icons and widgets are made from multiple layers of Liquid Glass that gives the appearance of depth.\nThe Lock Screen features a spatial scene option for photo wallpapers, giving them a 3D look and a sense of movement. The Home Screen might look different with an option for translucent icons and widgets, but it is functionally the same.\nApple streamlined the Camera app layout with simpler navigation. It has Photo and Video toggles, with other options tucked away behind menus that expand out with a tap. You can swipe to get to more photo and video options. Apple also updated the Photos app to re-add separate tabs for the Library and Collections views. In Photos, you can also activate Spatial Scene for any image, getting a unique 3D view of the image.\nSafari has a whole new look, and Apple has updated navigation. By default, Safari adopts the more rounded Liquid Glass buttons and nixes the settings at the bottom of the app, but there's an option to bring them back with a floating tab bar if you prefer a more feature rich menu. Apple Music, News, and Podcasts all have a new tab bar that floats above the content in the app and dynamically shrinks when users are browsing, so the interface options take up less space on the display.\nAlong with a new design, Apple is expanding the Apple Intelligence features that are available on the iPhone. Messages, FaceTime, and Phone all support Live Translation for automatically translating conversations when you're conversing with someone who speaks another language.\nVisual Intelligence now understands what's on your screen, and can answer questions about what you're looking at using ChatGPT integration. The feature can help you find products, add events to your calendar, and more. Image Playground supports ChatGPT image generation so you can create images in more styles. Genmoji has a new feature for mixing multiple emoji characters to make a new one, and adding descriptions to create an all-new emoji character.\nIn the Wallet app, there's a new Apple Intelligence feature that can scan your emails to summarize order tracking details from merchants, even if you didn't make the purchase with Apple Pay. It lets you see all your purchases and their tracking info in one spot. Wallet also now supports paying with installments in stores and getting rewards on in-store purchases. Boarding passes in Wallet support Live Activities for real-time flight tracking, and include access to Maps and Find My.\nThe Shortcuts app supports intelligent actions that can summarize text, create images, or tap into Apple Intelligence models, making it easier than ever to create automations. Reminders is able to suggest tasks, grocery items and follow-ups based on emails, and it can automatically categorize related reminders into sections.\nFor developers, Apple is debuting a new Foundation Models framework that allows developers to tap into the AI model that's at the core of Apple Intelligence, so developers can add new AI features to their apps.\nThe Phone app has a whole slew of new features. There's a unified layout that combines Favorites, Recents, and Voicemails. A new Call Screening feature asks unknown callers for their name and reason for calling before sending the call to you, stopping unwanted calls. When you're stuck on hold, there's a Hold Assist option that stays on the line for you, so you don't have to listen to irritating hold music. It lets you know when a live agent is available.\nMessages can screen texts from unknown senders, sending them silently to a dedicated folder where users can ask for more information or delete them. Group texts now have typing indicators and support for sending and receiving Apple Cash, plus Messages adds customizable backgrounds for each conversation and polls.\nIn Apple Music, there's a Lyrics Translation feature that translates lyrics that aren't in your language, and Lyrics Pronunciation helps you pronounce those lyrics. A new AutoMix feature uses intelligence to transition from one song to another, using time stretching and beat matching for a seamless shift between songs.\nApple Maps supports Visited Places so you can remember where you've been, and on-device intelligence can understand your daily route, popping up your preferred routes and letting you know about potential delays and alternate route options.\nApple added a new Apple Games app that's an all-in-one destination for discovering and playing games. It supports recommendations, leaderboards, competitions with friends, and more.\nCarPlay is getting the same Liquid Glass design overhaul, along with widgets and Live Activities that sync from the iPhone. There are Tapback options, important conversations can be pinned, and Apple added a new compact view for incoming calls so directions aren't blocked.\nIn iOS 26, AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2 support studio-quality sound recording and improved sound for calls and videos. The AirPods can also be used to take a photo or record a video with a press on the stem. For battery management, there's a new Adaptive Power setting on the iPhone that intelligently determines when you're using more battery than normal and adjusts things like screen brightness to preserve battery life.\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here.\niOS 18 to iOS 26\nIf you're wondering why Apple went from iOS 18 to iOS 26, it was to streamline operating system naming. Apple is numbering all of its operating systems with the year going forward, so the \"26\" in iOS 26 represents the release season between September 2025 and September 2026.\nEverything released this year uses the same number, so iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, and so on. It will help keep numbering more straightforward in the future, even if it seems strange to skip iOS 19 to iOS 26.\nDesign Changes\nThe biggest single change in iOS 26 is the design overhaul. Apple is using a new Liquid Glass material throughout the operating system, and it has transformed the look of the iPhone's software.\nLiquid Glass is translucent, and like real glass, it allows light and color to shine through to put the focus on the content that's on your iPhone's display. Apple designed Liquid Glass to behave like it does in the real world, so it can subtly reflect light when you move your iPhone. It uses real-time rendering to dynamically react to movement with reflective highlights.\nApp icons are meant to look like several layers of glass, which gives them a subtle depth. Liquid Glass works well for the standard color icons, but Apple also added a translucent app icon option that makes your iPhone look even more like a sheet of glass.\nThere are actually two main aspects to the iOS 26 redesign: the Liquid Glass look, and simplified navigation that highlights the Liquid Glass material. There are too many cosmetic changes in iOS 26 to go through each one, but there is an overarching design language that Apple adopted.\nIt is worth noting that while iOS 26 looks different, it still feels like prior versions of iOS. Apple wanted it to be familiar to iOS users despite the changes, so menus, bars, and buttons look different and do have some different functions, but they are functions that iPhone users are already familiar with.\nPop Out Menus\nIn several places, Apple streamlined navigation and moved extra settings into pop out menus. In the Camera app, for example, Apple shows just the two main modes: photo and video. But if you tap on one of the buttons, you'll see a pop out menu with a range of photo settings that you can activate.\nApple says it wanted controls, toolbars, and navigation to have a distinct functional layer that sits above apps, morphing and dynamically changing as users need more options.\nThis kind of menu is common in iOS 26, so if there's something that you can't find, tap on one of the small icons on the screen, because chances are the menu expands out with more options.\nDisappearing Navigation\nIn several places, navigation elements disappear when they're not needed, and appear when they are. An example of this is in Safari. When you scroll down, the tab bar will collapse down into a small bar that shows just the name of the website. Scrolling back up brings back the full Safari tab bar so you can use the interface buttons that you need.\nIn Photos and Apple Music, there's an expanding search bar. Tapping it unfurls into a full search menu and collapses the other navigation bar menu options. Tapping out of search and on one of the other icons collapses search again and the menu bar returns to how it was. This is similar to the pop out menus, with an emphasis on putting things you don't need out of sight until you want to use them.\nThere are other examples of this, too. In the Health app, you won't see Health categories anymore until you tap on the search icon. That swaps to the search and categories interface, and a swap back is done by tapping on the heart to get back to your pinned items.\nCorners and Spacing\nIn areas with a long list of options or categories, such as the Settings app, Apple has increased spacing and padding for a less cluttered look. You will need to scroll longer to get through settings now, but there's more space to tap and it can be more readable with the additional spacing.\nApple shrunk navigation bars at the bottom of apps, so they take up less display space. A good example of this is in the Photos app, where the editing options have been condensed down into a smaller bar.\nNavigation bars, side bars, card-style menus, notifications, buttons, toggles, search bars, and other interface elements have a more rounded look. Single buttons are entirely circular, such as those in Control Center, while navigation bars are pill-shaped with distinctly round corners. Toggles and notifications have an elongated pill-shape too, and cards are also more rounded in appearance at the corners. The keyboard has round edges at the top.\niOS 18 had more of a squircle (rounded square) shape for much of the interface, but almost everything in iOS 26 is round. An exception is app icons, which have not changed in shape.\nCross-Platform Cohesiveness\nLiquid Glass is not exclusive to iOS 26. The new design extends to all of Apple's operating systems, including iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, and of course, visionOS 26, which is the OS that inspired the overhaul.\nWith the same design available across all of Apple's operating systems, everything feels more cohesive, which was one of Apple's main goals with Liquid Glass.\nDesign Summary\n- Everything looks different in iOS 26.\n- There's an emphasis on content, with Apple aiming to make everything else fade away.\n- Interface elements are made from Liquid Glass, which is translucent and designed to work like glass in the real world. Colors and content shine through, and everything has a more liquid feel.\n- Almost all interface elements are rounder.\n- Navigation elements and settings are meant to hide away when you don't need them. If you're missing a setting, it's likely you'll find it in a pop out menu when you tap on a single icon.\n- Liquid Glass is system wide. Apple's apps have been redesigned with it to varying degrees, and third-party apps will also adopt the design language.\nHome Screen and Lock Screen\nOn the Lock Screen, there are two key changes beyond design updates. The time can auto adjust to be larger when your wallpaper allows for more space, and there is an option to enable a 2D to 3D spatial photo effect that adds depth to your wallpaper images.\nThe size of the time adjusts automatically in some cases, but you can also drag the bar at the corner to resize it to make it bigger. Note that you need to use the first font in the font list, because it's the only one that can be resized.\nWhen choosing a photo for a wallpaper, there is an option to use a 2D image to generate a 3D \"Spatial Scene\" that uses depth information to separate the subject from the background. The Spatial Scene wallpaper will feature a little bit of motion when you move your iPhone, enhancing the 3D effect.\nMost of the Home Screen is the same, aside from the Liquid Glass design changes. You can tap into Edit > Customize to select a new \"Clear\" option that gives all of your app icons a translucent, Liquid Glass look.\nMessages\nThe Messages app features customized backgrounds, an option to create polls, and enhanced spam filtering and blocking features.\n- Customizable backgrounds - In an individual or group conversation, you can tap on the name at the top and then choose the \"Backgrounds\" option to set a custom background for each conversation. There are options like sky, water, and aurora, or you can choose a color. You can also select photos or generate a background with Image Playground. Backgrounds that you set are changed for every participant in the conversation, unless they toggle off the feature in Messages settings.\n- Polls - Tap on the \"+\" button to get to a new option to create a poll in any chat. You can add up to 12 different options, then send it to allow people to vote. Others can also add options to the list. On devices with Apple Intelligence, polls may come up as a suggestion.\n- Group chats - Group chats support typing indicators and sending and receiving Apple Cash. There's also an option to add someone in a group chat who isn't in your contacts to your Contacts app with a tap.\n- Natural language search - Messages supports natural language search.\n- Copy/paste - You can now select just part of a text message to copy. Long press and tap on the new \"Select\" option to do so.\n- Spam messages - Spam messages and Unknown Senders are two separate categories in iOS 26. There's a new Filter box at the top right of the Messages app, and Unknown Senders go in one category, while Spam goes in another. A badge lets you know if you have messages in these categories, but you won't get notifications for them.\n- Unknown Senders - Messages from Unknown Senders won't send notifications if the option to filter them is on, but you will get alerts if it is a time sensitive notification, such as a notification from a ride share app or a delivery person.\n- Live Translation - Messages that aren't in your language can be automatically translated as you receive them in iOS 26. Apple Intelligence is required for this feature.\nPhone\nThe Phone app includes multiple new features that are designed to cut down on unwanted calls and reduce the amount of time that you need to spend on the phone.\nCall Screening\nCall Screening is an extension of Live Voicemail. When you receive a call from an unknown number that is not in your list of contacts, your iPhone asks the caller for their name and reason for calling. The information is relayed to you so you can decide if you want to accept the call or ignore it.\nCall Screening can be enabled in the Phone section of the Settings app.\nHold Assist\nIf you make a phone call and you're stuck on hold waiting to speak to a person, you can activate Hold Assist. Your iPhone can wait for you while you do other things, and then let you know when a live agent is on the line. The agent is informed that you'll be on the call in just a moment.\nTo use Hold Assist, tap on the \"Hold\" button after placing a call.\nLive Translation\nWhen talking to someone that speaks another language, there is an option to turn on Live Translation to have the call automatically translated for each person on the line. Live Translation is an Apple Intelligence feature and requires an iPhone 15 Pro or later.\nOther Features\n- Unified Layout - The Phone app has an optional unified layout that combines Favorites, Recents, and Voicemails in one spot.\n- Spam calls - Calls identified as spam can be silenced and sent directly to voicemail.\n- Type to Siri - You can now use Type to Siri while on a phone call.\n- Call History - Tapping on the info button next to a call in the recents list or on a name or number in the unified view shows a call history that lists every time you've spoken with someone.\n- Flag spam voicemails - If you tap into a voicemail from a person not in your contact list, you'll see an option to report the voicemail as spam.\n- eSIM transfer - It's easier to transfer an eSIM to an Android device and vice versa with new integrated eSIM transfer capabilities.\n- Focus eSIM - There is a Focus mode for silencing a single eSIM, so you can disable a home number at work, or a work number at home.\n- Screen sharing - The Phone app supports screen sharing and SharePlay during phone calls.\nApple Music\nThere are several new Apple Music features, ranging from translation to new options for transitioning between songs.\nAutoMix\nApple Music includes AutoMix, a feature that transitions from one song to another as the song that's playing ends. It uses time stretching and beat mixing for a seamless shift, and Apple says that it's meant to work like a DJ.\nSongs transition at the \"perfect moment\" based on an analysis of the key and tempo of the music, with AutoMix serving as an alternative to Crossfade.\nOther New Features\n- Lyrics Translation - Songs that are in another language can be translated automatically with Lyrics Translation.\n- Lyrics Pronunciation - Lyrics Pronunciation helps you pronounce lyrics that are in another language.\n- Pinned playlists - Apple Music playlists can now be pinned to the top of the Music app, with pinned playlists available in a new Home Screen widget as well.\n- Playlist folders - Playlists can be organized into folders.\n- iPhone microphone - When using the Apple Music Sing karaoke feature on Apple TV, the iPhone can be used as a microphone.\n- Lock Screen - On the Lock Screen, the Now Playing widget now provides full screen album artwork. Album art animates based on what you're listening to.\nShortcuts\nThe Shortcuts app now features Apple Intelligence, and the option to use Apple's AI models when creating shortcuts. Apple Intelligence models can be used for summarizing PDFs, generating recipes, answering questions, and more. Writing Tools and Image Playground are available for spellchecking, image generation, rewriting, tone changes, and more.\nApple offers several pre-programmed Shortcuts in the Gallery that use Apple Intelligence, such as options for getting a morning summary of the coming day, generating a haiku, or summarizing a PDF.\nWhen creating a shortcut, there is an Apple Intelligence section that includes options for an on-device model, a cloud model that uses Private Cloud Compute, or ChatGPT. Some pre-set options are available, such as opening Visual Intelligence, generating an image with Image Playground, or using Writing Tools, along with the option to use a model.\nSelecting one of the AI models provides an open-ended prompt where you can write in what you want it to do. You need to work in the confines of the model that Apple provides, pairing it with other functionality in Shortcuts.\nOther New App Features\nSafari\n- Tab View - Safari has a new \"Compact\" view for the Tab bar that puts several settings out of sight. You can change back to the standard bottom bar or top bar in the Safari section of the Settings app.\n- Liquid Glass - When scrolling, the Tab bar collapses down. Scroll up to bring it back.\n- Tracking Prevention - Advanced fingerprinting protection extends to all browsing by default. Advanced fingerprinting protection prevents websites from tracking your device usage across websites. Previously, this was limited to private browsing unless explicitly enabled.\n- Web apps - Every website added to the Home Screen through Safari opens a web app, even if it is not configured that way. In earlier versions of iOS, websites added to the Home Screen that were not properly configured would open in Safari.\n- HDR images - Safari supports HDR images in iOS 26.\n- SVG icons - Safari supports the SVG file format for icons in the bookmark bar and start page.\nCamera\n- Design - The Camera app has a simplified design with just Photo and Video tabs. Swiping swaps to other photo modes, and tapping on one of the buttons expands the available settings.\n- Lens - If the Camera lens is dirty, your iPhone lets you know that it needs to be cleaned.\n- AirPods - The AirPods 4 or AirPods Pro 2 can be used to take a photo or start a video recording by pressing and holding on the stem.\nPhotos\n- Design - Apple reverted to a more pre-iOS 18 design for Photos, separating the Library and Collections into different tabs.\n- Search - Video thumbnails show up in search results.\n- Spatial Scenes - You can use a new 3D feature to turn 2D photos into 3D images, adding subtle depth and motion that separates the subject from the background.\nNotes\n- Markdown - The Notes app supports exporting in Markdown.\n- Math Notes - Three-variable equations can be used to create 3D graphs.\nReminders\n- Categorization - Apple Intelligence can categorize reminders into different sections.\n- Suggestions - Apple Intelligence can suggest adding tasks, grocery items, and more to Reminders based on what's on your iPhone.\nFaceTime\n- Live Translation - FaceTime supports Live Translation, displaying captions if you're talking to someone who speaks another language.\n- Call Screening - FaceTime has new screening features for unknown numbers. Calls from unknown numbers can be asked for more information like name and reason for calling, or they can be sent directly to voicemail. Missed calls from unknown numbers can be silenced and sent to an Unknown Callers list.\nPodcasts\n- Enhance Dialogue - An Enhance Dialogue option mutes background sounds to enhance speech.\n- Playback speed - There are more options for playback speeds, ranging from 0.5x to 3x.\nApple Maps\n- Preferred Routes - Apple Maps learns your frequent commutes and the Maps widget can let you know if there are any significant delays along your preferred route, offering an alternative if necessary.\n- Saved Places - Apple Maps can save the places that you visit and spend time in so you can look them up later.\n- Incidents - There are additional types of incidents to choose from when making a report in the Maps app.\nWallet\nThere is an option to add a passport to the Wallet app, which creates a \"Digital ID\" that can be used at select TSA checkpoints in the United States.\nA new \"Verify with Wallet on the Web\" option allows websites to use the license or ID you have stored in the Wallet app for age and identity verification purposes. The process involves scanning a QR code with the iPhone and then authenticating, so it works in Safari and all other web browsers, too. It also works on non-Apple devices.\n- Package tracking - Apple Intelligence can recognize order tracking details from emails, adding the information to the Wallet app. This works on all purchases, not just those that were made using Apple Pay.\n- Boarding Passes - Boarding passes in Wallet have been upgraded and now show relevant information below the boarding pass, like Apple Maps directions for the airport terminal, and a link to Find My for luggage tracking.\n- Live Activity - Boarding passes now show up as a Live Activity on iPhone, so you can keep track of relevant flight information without having to open the Wallet app. Flight Live Activities can be shared with friends and family.\n- AutoFill Credit Cards - You can add and remove credit cards and debit cards that work with AutoFill from the Wallet app.\n- Apple Pay - Apple Pay supports rewards and installments for in-store purchases.\nGames\niOS 26 includes a Games app that comes pre-installed on the iPhone. It has all of the games from the App Store, along with Apple Arcade titles.\nGames you have installed are shown in a Library section. A Play Together section lets you invite friends to \"Challenges,\" where you compete to win in a game-specific task like getting the highest score during a given week.\nPreview\nThe Mac Preview app is now available on the iPhone and the iPad. It can be used for creating, viewing, and annotating PDFs. There are also tools for cropping, flipping, rotating, resizing, and editing images.\nJournal\n- Multiple Journals - You can now create more than one journal if you want to separate your entries by topic.\n- Maps - Journal entries can be viewed on a map.\n- Images - There's support for adding images inline with text.\nCarPlay\nCarPlay has been updated with the same Liquid Glass design that Apple added to iOS 26. The look includes layered glass-like app icons and translucent user interface elements.\nNew Messages App Features\nStarting with iOS 26, you can respond to messages with standard Tapbacks like a heart, thumbs up, or exclamation marks directly through CarPlay.\nCarPlay also now displays pinned conversations in the Messages app.\nPhone Calls\nApple added a compact view for incoming phone calls, so that you can still see other information on the screen, such as turn-by-turn directions.\nLive Activities and Widgets\nCarPlay's Dashboard screen can now show Live Activities, letting you keep track of things like a flight's arrival time at a glance.\nThe regular version of CarPlay also now has a widgets screen, for things like calendar appointments and HomeKit accessory controls.\nOther New Features\n- Multi-Touch Maps - Starting with iOS 26, CarPlay users can interact with mapping apps using multi-touch gestures in supported vehicles. This allows users to zoom and pan on the map with their fingers, just like they can on an iPhone.\n- Watch Videos While Parked - iPhone users can wirelessly stream videos to the CarPlay screen using AirPlay, according to Apple. For safety reasons, video playback will only be available when the vehicle is parked, to prevent distracted driving. The connected iPhone will be able to detect when the vehicle is in motion and end playback. Automakers need to add support for this feature, so it might be limited to newer vehicles and take some time to roll out.\n- Smart Display Zoom - iOS 26 adds a new Smart Display Zoom setting to CarPlay. When the setting is enabled, CarPlay will be automatically resized to better fit the shape and size of your vehicle's dashboard screen, if possible.\nBattery and Adaptive Power Mode\nApple updated the Battery section of the Settings app to provide a more in-depth look at how iPhone usage impacts battery life, and how much battery apps are draining.\nThe Battery section now displays a weekly view of battery usage along with a comparison of how much battery you're currently using compared to your typical average. You can see if you're using more, the same, or less battery life than you do on most days, with a readout of which apps are using the most battery, and by how much.\nApp battery usage includes specific details, such as letting you know if an app ran in the background longer, was on your screen longer, or sent more notifications than normal. You'll also see how much battery you've used since your last charge.\nApple also added an Adaptive Power mode that detects when iPhone usage is higher than normal and makes small performance adjustments like lowering display brightness or allowing certain background activities to take longer to extend battery life. Adaptive Power Mode is only available on the iPhone 15 Pro models and newer because it uses Apple Intelligence.\nOn the Lock Screen and in the Battery section, you'll see information on how long it will take your iPhone to charge up to full when it's plugged in.\nApple Intelligence Updates\nThere are new Apple Intelligence features throughout iOS 26, such as the Live Translation options in Phone, Messages, and FaceTime, and the suggestions and sorting options in the Reminders app. Some existing Apple Intelligence features have also been updated.\nVisual Intelligence\nIn iOS 26, Visual Intelligence works with screenshots for the first time. You can capture a screenshot of what's on your screen and then use Visual Intelligence on it to identify what you're looking at, find images, and get more information through ChatGPT.\nThere's a Highlight to Search option that lets you conduct an image search for a specific object in a screenshot, even if there are multiple things in the picture. It works with the apps that you use most frequently, like Google Search, Etsy, and others, and the feature is useful for finding a product in an image.\nIf you don't need to isolate one object in your screenshot, you can simply tap on the Ask button to ask questions about what you're seeing. Questions will be relayed to ChatGPT, and ChatGPT will provide the information. The Search button queries Google Search for more information.\nAs with the standard Visual Search, if your screenshot includes dates, times, and related information for an event, it can be added directly to your calendar.\nVisual Intelligence also adds support for quick identification of new types of objects. It can now identify art, books, landmarks, natural landmarks, and sculptures, in addition to the animals and plants it was able to provide information on before.\nGenmoji\nGenmoji supports combining two or more emoji together to create a new character. You can also combine existing emoji with text-based descriptions to tweak them, which is a more convenient starting point for generating something new.\nImage Playground\nApple added support for ChatGPT image generation capabilities, which means you can use several ChatGPT image styles when generating images. Options include Anime, Oil Painting, Watercolor, Vector, and Print.\nThere's also an open-ended option where you can tell ChatGPT what style you want, and you can make realistic images with this option. The new ChatGPT styles join the existing Animation, Sketch, and Illustration styles.\nNote that generating images with ChatGPT is limited if you do not have a ChatGPT subscription, so you cannot freely use the ChatGPT styles.\nNew AirPods Features\niOS 26 adds several new features to the AirPods Pro 2 and the AirPods 4 through an accompanying AirPods firmware update.\nImproved Call Quality\nThe studio-quality recording feature brings more natural vocal texture and clarity to iPhone calls, FaceTime calls, and all CallKit-enabled apps like Zoom.\nBoth studio-quality audio recording and improved call quality are available across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and support the Camera app, Voice Memos, Messages dictation, third-party camera apps, and video conferencing apps.\nCamera Remote\nThe AirPods can be used as a camera remote with the Camera app and third-party camera apps on iPhone or iPad. Just press and hold on the AirPods stem to take a photo or start a video recording.\nWhen the recording is finished, a press and hold gesture will stop the recording. Apple says that users who like to capture themselves singing and dancing for social networks like TikTok will be able to easily perform in sync with a soundtrack while simultaneously recording video.\nSoftware Updates\nWith the latest software updates, Apple is finally adding a way to manually update the firmware on your AirPods. When your AirPods are connected, you can go to the Settings app to get to a new software update interface.\nPause for Sleep\nIf you're listening to music, a podcast, or a book while you're in bed and you're wearing AirPods, the AirPods will pause your audio when you fall asleep.\nRead More\nSmaller Changes\nThere are dozens if not hundreds of smaller changes in iOS 26, and we've highlighted some of the more notable ones below.\n- Custom Ringtones - You can set custom ringtones in iOS 26 without using GarageBand. Ringtones can be saved to the Files app and then set using the Share Sheet.\n- New ringtone - There is a new variation of the Reflection ringtone that's called \"Alt 1.\"\n- Screenshots - Apple tweaked the screenshots interface, rearranging some of the buttons and adding in the Visual Intelligence feature. CarPlay screenshots can also now be displayed in the Screen Capture section of the Settings app.\n- iCloud Drive - There is an option to turn off iCloud Drive syncing when on a cellular network.\n- Contacts - The Contacts app has new Monogram styles that you can set for people.\n- Blocked Contacts - When you block someone, Apple now suggests Safety Check as an option.
