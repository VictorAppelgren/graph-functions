  "content": "Aaron Rodgers joined Pittsburgh. Davante Adams went to Hollywood. Cooper Kupp is in Seattle. Russell Wilson\u2019s latest stop is the Big Apple.\n\nBut the most veteran face in a new place this NFL season is 73-year-old Pete Carroll on the sideline in Las Vegas. Carroll is leading the Raiders after a one-year hiatus from coaching following 14 years with the Seahawks.\n\nRodgers and Wilson are the most notable quarterbacks who changed teams. Geno Smith, Sam Darnold, Justin Fields and Jameis Winston also found new homes.\n\nSeveral star wide receivers joined Adams and Kupp on the move, including D.K. Metcalf, Deebo Samuel, Stefon Diggs and George Pickens.\n\nOn the defensive side, Super Bowl standouts Josh Sweat and Milton Williams cashed in after helping the Philadelphia Eagles dominate Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs. Teammate Darius Slay also moved on. Jalen Ramsey and Minkah Fitzpatrick swapped teams. Jonathan Allen, Grady Jarrett, Joey Bosa, Talanoa Hufanga and Dre Greenlaw are wearing new uniforms.\n\nHere are some of the top players on new teams:\n\nAaron Rodgers: The four-time NFL MVP chose to extend his career with the Steelers after two disappointing seasons with the New York Jets. The 41-year-old Rodgers had the worst record of his career last season, going 5-12. But he still threw for 3,897 yards with 28 touchdowns, 11 interceptions and a 90.5 passer rating. The Steelers and coach Mike Tomlin are hoping Rodgers has one more run in him to help them overcome their recent playoff failures.\n\nRussell Wilson: The 10-time Pro Bowl quarterback is on his fourth team in five seasons. Wilson started 6-1 in Pittsburgh last year but the team lost five straight games to end the season. Wilson had 2,482 yards passing, 16 TDs, five picks and a 95.6 passer rating in 11 games in the regular season. He signed with the New York Giants, who also added Winston and then drafted QB Jaxson Dart in the first round.\n\nGeno Smith: Carroll reunited with Smith in Las Vegas following a trade with the Seahawks. Smith, a two-time Pro Bowl pick who rejuvenated his career in Seattle after replacing Wilson, gives the Raiders stability at QB.\n\nSam Darnold: After a breakout year in Minnesota, Darnold cashed in with the Seahawks in free agency. He threw for 4,319 yards, 35 TDs, 12 picks and a 102.5 passer rating while going 14-4 with the Vikings.\n\nJustin Fields: The No. 11 overall pick in 2021 by Chicago showed promise in Pittsburgh, going 4-2 in six starts. He\u2019ll get an opportunity to prove himself with the New York Jets.\n\nDavante Adams: The three-time All-Pro went from Las Vegas to New York during last season and back to the West Coast with the Los Angeles Rams. Adams had 85 catches for 1,083 yards and eight TDs last season.\n\nCooper Kupp: The Seahawks traded Metcalf and signed Kupp, the 2021 AP Offensive Player of the Year and Super Bowl MVP. Kupp hasn\u2019t played a full season since \u201921 but had 67 receptions for 710 yards and six TDs in 12 games in 2024.\n\nD.K. Metcalf: Before Rodgers officially signed with the Steelers, they gave him a No. 1 receiver. The two-time Pro Bowl pick had 66 catches for 992 yards and five TDs in 15 games last season for Seattle.\n\nDeebo Samuels: The Washington Commanders gave Jayden Daniels another playmaker, acquiring Samuel from San Francisco.\n\nGeorge Pickens: The Dallas Cowboys acquired the mercurial Pickens from Pittsburgh to team with CeeDee Lamb and bolster Dak Prescott\u2019s options.\n\nLaremy Tunsil: The Commanders got the five-time Pro Bowl left tackle from Houston to protect Daniels\u2019 blind side.\n\nJosh Sweat: The Eagles linebacker turned 2 1/2 sacks in the Super Bowl into a $76.4 million deal from the Cardinals.\n\nJonathan Allen: After two Pro Bowl seasons in eight years in Washington, Allen signed with the Vikings to boost the interior of their defensive line.",
