  "description": "Ellen DeGeneres and wife Portia de Rossi relocated to England in 2024, embracing countryside living with their pets and simpler lifestyle",
  "content": "Ellen DeGeneres and her wife, Portia de Rossi, moved across the pond where they are admittedly thriving.\n\nDeGeneres and de Rossi, who have been married since 2008, relocated from Los Angeles to England in fall 2024.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely beautiful. We\u2019re just not used to seeing this kind of beauty,\u201d DeGeneres said during a talk with broadcaster Richard Bacon in July 2025. \u201cThe villages and the towns and the architecture \u2014 everything you see is charming and it\u2019s just a simpler way of life.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cIt\u2019s clean. Everything here is just better, the way animals are treated, people are polite. I just love it here.\u201d\n\nDeGeneres and de Rossi even brought their menagerie of pets, including a stable of horses, to the United Kingdom.\n\nKeep scrolling to learn more about DeGeneres\u2019 quiet life in England:\n\nDeGeneres said during her BBC conversation that she and the Arrested Development alum initially purchased acreage in the Cotswolds to use as a \u201cpart-time house.\u201d They made their move permanent after Donald Trump won the presidential election in November 2024.\n\n\u201cWe got here the day before the election and woke up to lots of texts from our friends with crying emojis, and I was like, \u2018He got in,\u2019\u201d the comedian recalled. \u201cAnd we\u2019re like, \u2018We\u2019re staying here.\u2019\u201d\n\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi Live in the Countryside\n\nThe former Ellen DeGeneres Show host often shares glimpses of the couple\u2019s new abode via social media, showing off the open-concept floor plan with cozy decor such as flannel blankets, leather armchairs and a copper-colored striped area rug.\n\nThey ultimately listed the 43-acre property, named Kitesbridge Farm, for sale in July 2025.\n\n\u201cWhen we decided to live here full-time, we knew that Portia couldn\u2019t live without her horses,\u201d DeGeneres told The Wall Street Journal in a statement. \u201cWe needed a home that had a horse facility and pastures for them.\u201d\n\nA source told Us in August 2025 that DeGeneres had been spending the bulk of her time farming, gardening and taking care of her pet animals.\n\n\u201cThose close to her have never seen her happier,\u201d the insider added.\n\nAfter DeGeneres and de Rossi moved to England, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that they have been regular guests at the exclusive Soho Farmhouse.\n\n\u201cShe was dressed in a country casual way,\u201d the insider said in November 2024. \u201cShe was super understated and no one was really paying much attention to her \u2026 but then you just don\u2019t expect to see Ellen there as it\u2019s more a haunt of U.K. celebrities.\u201d\n\nA source told Us in August 2025 that DeGeneres had seamlessly adapted to her new life across the pond.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different lifestyle for her,\u201d the insider told Us in a cover story. \u201cShe\u2019s very chill and in her element.\u201d\n\nAccording to the source, DeGeneres and de Rossi had been contemplating a move for a while before making the final call.\n\n\u201cThey had visited before and looked at homes but weren\u2019t sure when they would do it,\u201d the insider noted. \u201cWhen they found the right place, they jumped on it.\u201d\n\nRosie O\u2019Donnell also moved abroad in 2025, settling in Ireland with her then-12-year-old child, Clay.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never really known Ellen to say anything political in her life, so I was surprised to read that she left because of President Trump. Like, that shocked me, actually,\u201d O\u2019Donnell exclusively told Us in April 2025. \u201cI\u2019ve been a political person my whole life, not better or worse, it\u2019s just a different way to be in the world. \u2026 We\u2019re not really in each other\u2019s worlds, and it\u2019s been kind of awkward, but you know what? I wish her the best. I wish that she has peace and love in her life and that she is OK.\u201d\n\nMonths later in July 2025, Trump publicly threatened to revoke O\u2019Donnell\u2019s American citizenship. DeGeneres was vocal in her support of the actress.\n\n\u201cGood for you, @rosie,\u201d DeGeneres wrote via social media at the time.",

      "text": "Ellen DeGeneres is showing her support for friend Rosie O\u2019Donnell as President Donald Trump erroneously claims to threaten her U.S. citizenship.\n\u201cGood for you @rosie,\u201d DeGeneres, 67, wrote via Instagram on Sunday, July 13, sharing screenshots of the president\u2019s post on his social media app, Truth Social, and O\u2019Donnell\u2019s subsequent response.\nOn Saturday, July 12, President Donald Trump threatened to revoke O\u2019Donnell\u2019s U.S. citizenship, despite having no constitutional authority to do so.\n\u201cBecause of the fact that Rosie O\u2019Donnell is not in the best interests of our Great Country, I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship,\u201d Trump wrote on the social media platform. \u201cShe is a Threat to Humanity, and should remain in the wonderful Country of Ireland, if they want her. GOD BLESS AMERICA!\u201d\nAccording to expert Julia Gelatt, who spoke to The New York Times, a president does not have the power to take away a U.S-born citizen\u2019s citizenship.\n\u201cU.S citizens can relinquish their citizenship voluntarily, and federal courts can strip naturalized citizens of their citizenship if there is proven fraud or misrepresentation or other major cause,\u201d Gelatt, an associate director of the immigration program at the Migration Policy Institute, told the publication. \u201cBut U.S.-born citizens cannot have their citizenship taken away.\nO\u2019Donnell promptly reacted to the president\u2019s threat, taking to social media to respond.\n\u201cHey donald \u2014 you\u2019re rattled again? 18 years later and I still live rent-free in that collapsing brain of yours. You call me a threat to humanity \u2013 but I\u2019m everything you fear: a loud woman a queer woman a mother who tells the truth an american who got out of the country b4 u set it ablaze,\u201d O\u2019Donnell 63, wrote via Instagram on Saturday.\n\u201cYou build walls \u2013 I build a life for my autistic kid in a country where decency still exists,\u201d she continued in the post, which featured a picture of the president posting for a photo alongside convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. \u201cYou crave loyalty \u2013 I teach my children to question power. You sell fear on golf courses \u2014 I nurture, I create, I persist. You are everything that is wrong with america \u2014 and I\u2019m everything you hate about what\u2019s still right with it. You want to revoke my citizenship? Go ahead and try, king joffrey with a tangerine spray tan. I\u2019m not yours to silence i never was.\u201d\nO\u2019Donnell announced in March that she moved to Ireland and was in the process of getting her citizenship. DeGeneres and her wife, Portia de Rossi, relocated to the English countryside last year. O\u2019Donnell confessed to Us Weekly in an exclusive interview that she hasn\u2019t been in touch with DeGeneres, 67, and was \u201cshocked\u201d by her decision to leave the U.S.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never really known Ellen to say anything political in her life, so I was surprised to read that she left because of President Trump. Like, that shocked me, actually,\u201d O\u2019Donnell told Us. I\u2019ve been a political person my whole life, not better or worse, it\u2019s just a different way to be in the world. I was very clear about the reason why I was leaving, and I don\u2019t think it came as a surprise to anyone. We\u2019re not really in each other\u2019s worlds, and it\u2019s been kind of awkward but you know what? I wish her the best. I wish that she has peace and love in her life and that she is OK.\u201d\nDespite not having the strongest relationship with DeGeneres, O\u2019Donnell doesn\u2019t have any \u201cmalice\u201d towards her whatsoever.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight against another gay woman. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re tenaciously opposed to each other. We\u2019re just very different people. We have had some stuff in the past that we never resolved. And not in any way as, as partners or lovers or anything like that, just as friends and comedians, but I wish her the best. I seriously do,\u201d she told Us. \u201cI think that there\u2019s enough room in the world for all of the gay comedians, and we all need to stick together because gay people are the next group to be threatened. And the way they attack trans people is absolutely terrifying. If people don\u2019t understand that they\u2019re a vital part of the LBGTQIA+ community, that\u2019s tragic because we protect our own, especially the most vulnerable.\u201d"

      "text": "Travis Kelce planned out his proposal to now-fianc\u00e9e Taylor Swift in advance \u2014 including asking her parents for her hand in marriage.\n\u201cTravis asked Taylor\u2019s parents for their blessing,\u201d a source exclusively tells Us Weekly, referring to the pop star\u2019s mom and dad, Andrea and Scott Swift.\nKelce and Taylor, both 35, announced their engagement on Tuesday, August 25, with a handful of dreamy proposal photos shared via Instagram.\n\u201cYour English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married \ud83e\udde8 ,\u201d the joint caption read.\nIn the snaps, Kelce got down on bended knee in the middle of a rose-filled garden and gave Taylor a diamond ring designed by Kindred Lubeck at Artifex Fine Jewelry. The bauble featured an old mine brilliant cut diamond, set on a gold band with smaller stones. It also had a thin bezel.\n\u201cTravis is incredibly thoughtful. He had a clear vision of what he wanted,\u201d a second source exclusively told Us. \u201cHe did it almost entirely on his own. He knows her so well and what she likes \u2014 a timeless, classic, vintage touch.\u201d\nAccording to the second insider, Kelce was \u201cvery observant and in tune with\u201d Taylor\u2019s preferred style and wanted to pick out a ring that he knew she\u2019d like.\nTaylor and Kelce have been together since summer 2023, making their public debut at one of his Kansas City Chiefs football games the following September. As the pair\u2019s romance blossomed, they started incorporating one another\u2019s families into the fold.\nSince becoming a noted fan of the Chiefs, Taylor has attended many of the games and often alongside her parents and her brother, Austin. Travis even gave Scott, a lifelong Philadelphia Eagles fan, a Chiefs-branded lanyard. Scott wore the red-and-gold gear to Swift\u2019s November 2023 Eras Tour concert in Argentina.\n\u201cGot him over to the good side, baby,\u201d Travis told his brother Jason Kelce, who used to play for the Eagles, on their \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast at the time. \u201cI might have persuaded him the night before at dinner when I met him. \u2026 Maybe, who knows?\u201d\nTravis\u2019 bond with the Swifts grew even closer in the offseason. Travis and Taylor both spent a handful of the summer with Scott as he recovered from quintuple bypass surgery.\n\u201cTravis was hanging with him the other day,\u201d Taylor said on an episode of Travis\u2019 podcast earlier this month. \u201cHe was like, \u2018So, uh, sweetie, he says he\u2019s at 75 percent and if this is 75 percent, I\u2019m truly terrified to give you the update.\u2019 My dad\u2019s like, \u2018New arteries, new me.\u2019\u201d"

      "text": "Travis Kelce knelt to the ground and pulled out a (massive) ring for Taylor Swift \u2014 and Us Weekly has all the details.\nThe couple took to Instagram on Tuesday, August 26, to share photos of their engagement. In one pic, Kelce, 35, held hands with Swift, also 35, while showing off her new rock. The ring featured an old mine brilliant cut diamond set on a gold band with more small stones. Designed by Kindred Lubeck at Artifex Fine Jewelry, the design was complete with a thin bezel. (An old mine brilliant cut dimaond is a pre-modern stone that is characterized by its imperfect symmetry, cushion shape and chunky facets.)\nAs for the cost, jewelry expert Nilesh Rakholia estimated the ring to be worth $950,000 to $1,270,000. The Abelini founder told Us, \u201cThe stone itself looks to be easily in the 7\u201310 carat range, which immediately places it among the most iconic celebrity engagement rings.\u201d\nAnother jeweler Laura Taylor, who specializes in engagement and wedding rings, told Us that the ring could be up to 12 carats. Taylor agreed that it was \u201ceasily worth\u201d $1 million.\nSwift teamed the massive diamond with a Cartier watch complete with a matching gold wristlet and diamond face.\nIn the sweet photos, Kelce got on one knee while wearing a Ralph Lauren navy blue shirt and white pants. Swift, for her part, stunned in a white top which was embellished with veritable stripes, thin straps and a flared hem. She teamed the look with an A-line flowy midi skirt. Swift put a hand on Kelce\u2019s cheek while they were surrounded by a garden of flowers.\nIn another shot, the duo closed their eyes and pressed their foreheads together while donning soft smiles. They also cuddled up together while relaxing on a bench under more florals.\n\u201cYour English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married \ud83e\udde8,\u201d Swift captioned the post with \u201cSo High School,\u201d her hit song about Kelce playing in the background.\nOn Tuesday, an insider exclusively revealed to Us how Travis picked out the perfect engagement ring for Taylor. \u201cTravis is incredibly thoughtful. He had a clear vision of what he wanted,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe did it almost entirely on his own. He knows her so well and what she likes \u2014 a timeless, classic, vintage touch.\u201d\nThe insider added, Travis is \u201cvery observant and in tune with\u201d Swift\u2019s preferred style. \u201cThat drove his decision,\u201d the insider told Us. \u201cHe considered everything about what she\u2019d like and want, and he paid attention to the jewelry she wears often for inspiration.\u201d\nSwift and Kelce started dating in the summer of 2023 after he attended her Eras Tour and wanted to meet her. While they did not meet at her concert because Swift was not offering meet and greets, they later got in contact after Kelce said he wanted to give her his number during an episode of his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast.\nIn December 2023, a source exclusively told Us Weekly that the lovebirds \u201chad plenty of really deep conversations about their future together\u201d and always tried to make \u201cas much time for each other as possible.\nIn April 2024, another insider revealed that Swift was happy not feeling like she had to \u201chide\u201d while dating Kelce. \u201c[He] makes her feel safe and protected like she has the freedom to be and act however she wants.\u201d"

The villages and the towns and the architecture \u2014 everything you see is charming and it\u2019s just a simpler way of life,\u201d DeGeneres said. \u201cIt\u2019s clean.

I just love it here.\u201d\nShe continued, \u201cWe moved here in November, which was not the ideal time, but I saw snow for the first time in my life. We love it here.

The menagerie of farm animals wandered into the living area, which included a flannel blanket draped over a leather armchair and a copper-colored striped area rug. There is also a fluffy, white bed for DeGeneres\u2019 dog to rest.\nIn another portion of the clip, DeGeneres filmed one of the sheep walking through the glass door into another room. The animal even walked past a sculpture that looked like a sheep.\n\u201cYes we have house sheep,\u201d she jokingly added in her caption.\nWhile DeGeneres was seemingly preoccupied by the unexpected houseguests, many of her social media followers were amazed by the home decor in the background.\n\u201cI need to see a full home tour, please \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\ude0d,\u201d HGTV maven Joanna Gaines wrote via Instagram comment, while another social media user added, \u201cLove the house \ud83d\ude0d.\u201d\nDeGeneres and de Rossi, 52, relocated from Montecito, California, to the Cotswolds in England late last year.\n\u201cMy wife.

      "text": "On a Sunday afternoon in late July, Ellen DeGeneres walked onto the stage at the historic Cheltenham Everyman Theatre in Cheltenham, England, to the tune of Harry Styles\u2019 \u201cYou\u2019re So Golden,\u201d then sat in front of a crowd of nearly 700 people for a surprise Q&A session. During the event, the former talk show host \u2014 who\u2019s remained mostly under the radar since ending her long-running chatfest in 2022 \u2014 discussed everything from her early days in showbiz to her 2020 fall from grace to what the future holds.\nShe also shed light on her recent decision to leave her beloved Montecito, California, neighborhood for greener pastures in the U.K. In November 2024, DeGeneres, 67, and her wife of 17 years, Portia de Rossi, 52, officially relocated to the Cotswolds \u2014 an idyllic region in the English countryside filled with rolling hills, stone cottages\u2026 and posh yet privacy-seeking A-listers like David and Victoria Beckham. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely beautiful,\u201d she told the audience of her adopted home. \u201cEverything here is better.\u201d\nAccording to sources, DeGeneres has found her happy place. She spends her days contentedly tending to her chickens, ushering sheep out of her open-air living room and walking to the local pub for lunch. \u201cIt\u2019s a different lifestyle for her,\u201d an insider tells Us Weekly. \u201cShe\u2019s very chill and in her element.\u201d She and de Rossi reside in a stunning 10,000-square-foot home called Hiaven, which they bought for a reported $26 million. (Their original Cotswolds property, Kitesbridge Farm, is currently up for sale for $30 million.)\nIt\u2019s a new chapter for DeGeneres \u2014 and also a chance for a career refresh. \u201cI do like my chickens here, but I am a little bit bored,\u201d she told English broadcaster and host Richard Bacon during her July 20 event, noting that she\u2019s still figuring out her next moves. (Just days later, it was announced that DeGeneres had signed with WME talent agency.) \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do yet,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to pick it very carefully.\u201d\nDeGeneres and de Rossi had been contemplating a move across the pond for some time. \u201cThey had visited before and looked at homes but weren\u2019t sure when they would do it,\u201d says an insider. \u201cWhen they found the right place, they jumped on it.\u201d They initially planned to stay in England just a few months out of the year, but decided to make it their permanent residence after the 2024 election. DeGeneres said in the Q&A that she and de Rossi were in the Cotswolds when Donald Trump\u2019s presidency was announced. \u201cWe were like, \u2018We\u2019re staying here. We\u2019re not going back.\u2019\u201d (They opted to sell Kitesbridge and move to Hiaven because, according to DeGeneres, the newer home has a horse facility and de Rossi \u201ccouldn\u2019t live without her horses.\u201d)\nShe\u2019s leaning into country living. \u201cEllen\u2019s been farming and gardening and taking care of her animals,\u201d says the insider. DeGeneres has shared photos and videos of her doing all of the above with her 135 million followers on Instagram, as well as footage of her and de Rossi rowing a boat and mowing the lawn on their sprawling 100-acre property, located in the cozy village of Great Tew. \u201cThose close to her have never seen her happier.\u201d DeGeneres raved about the U.K. to Bacon, saying she loves the \u201cabsolutely beautiful\u201d scenery and architecture, adding, \u201cI really like the people and [the] fish and chips are delicious. Everything you see is charming, and it\u2019s just a simpler way of life.\u201d\nPrivacy is a huge concern for DeGeneres and de Rossi, but they\u2019ve been chatting up the locals. \u201c[Ellen and Portia] have interesting things to say,\u201d shares a source. \u201cThey were friendly to local people and wanted to live normal lives, but were nervous of any press attention.\u201d Adds a Great Tew resident: \u201cI\u2019ve only met them very briefly, but from what I\u2019ve heard, everyone who has spent time with them seems to suggest they are very nice, good company and genuinely committed to making England their home.\u201d\nStill, many locals seem to be unaware of DeGerenes\u2019 celebrity status. A second source from the area tells Us several residents revealed that they had \u201cnever heard\u201d of the comedian when asked about her. \u201cBut then again, horsey people \u2014 and there are a lot of them around here \u2014 don\u2019t watch afternoon TV,\u201d explains the source. Whether DeGeneres is recognized or not, the Great Tew resident believes she and de Rossi have gotten a warm reception from the community. \u201cTo my knowledge, there\u2019s been nothing \u2018frosty\u2019 happening around here. I think this side of the Cotswolds is very welcoming and friendly.\u201d\nThe pair are regulars at the exclusive members\u2019 club Soho Farmhouse and have been spotted getting Sunday lunch at the Falkland Arms pub, a 16th-century inn in the center of town. \u201cIt\u2019s a maze of cozy nooks and crannies, shadowy and often dimly lit with low ceilings and a hearty atmosphere,\u201d a pub-goer says. \u201cEllen and Portia can easily slip in unnoticed.\u201d\nThey\u2019ve also been spending time with famous friends. They attended a star-studded party at British TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson\u2019s The Farmer\u2019s Dog pub in November 2024 and grabbed dinner with fellow former talk show host James Corden at the Chiltern Firehouse in London to celebrate de Rossi\u2019s birthday in February. (Corden purchased a property about an hour away from Great Tew in Oxfordshire.) \u201cThey have a good friend group,\u201d says the insider, adding that DeGeneres has traveled to the States a few times since the move to see people.\nIt hasn\u2019t all been picture-perfect. A third source says DeGeneres and de Rossi had a \u201crocky start\u201d in the Cotswolds. The Kitesbridge Farm area was flooded just days after they moved in following a severe windstorm, and they had to find their footing while adjusting to farm life. \u201cThings weren\u2019t quite as luxurious as they\u2019d been in Montecito,\u201d says the source, noting that the duo was spotted collecting their own trash bins from the end of their 700-foot driveway one blustery fall day. DeGeneres admitted in her Q&A that the chilly gray weather took some getting used to. \u201cThe winter is tough,\u201d she confessed, \u201cbut I still enjoyed it because we\u2019re not used to seasons in California.\u201d\nAnother \u2018Hollywood\u2019 problem? The third source says that two of the couple\u2019s cars, a vintage Land Rover Defender and a Land Rover Discovery, are too big to get over a width- and weight-restricted bridge that leads directly into town. \u201c[They\u2019ve] gotten used to taking the long way around to the village \u2014 a three-mile trip,\u201d shares the source, who notes that DeGeneres and de Rossi have also been seen walking to town on foot. \u201c[It\u2019s] probably quicker than the long-way-around drive.\u201d\nThe third source also says the more modern Hiaven \u2014 with its floor-to-ceiling windows and infinity pool \u2014 has been a better fit for the couple. (Andrew Barnes, a senior director of U.K. Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, told the Wall Street Journal the house looks like it belongs \u201cin Malibu.\u201d) \u201c[Ellen and Portia] went from a traditional farmhouse to something much more Hollywood,\u201d a source said in March. Some unexpectedly dark history about the property? The mansion was built near the site of a since-demolished farmhouse where a murder took place. In 2021, social worker Lynda Rickard was sentenced to jail for forging the will of her millionaire landlord, Anthony Sootheran, and then depriving him of food and medical help in order to inherit part of his estate.\nOverall, relocating has brought DeGeneres and de Rossi closer. \u201cThere\u2019s less work stress and more shared activities,\u201d explains the insider. The pair were spotted holding hands during a romantic stroll on Bond Street in London on July 29. \u201cIt\u2019s a calmer Ellen, so she\u2019s easier to be around. And Portia is really enjoying it.\u201d The Arrested Development alum retired from acting in 2018. \u201cPortia quit acting a long time ago, so she wasn\u2019t leaving her career,\u201d the insider adds. \u201cShe was already scaling back.\u201d\nThe cross-continent move has given DeGeneres some welcome distance from Hollywood. In 2020, after Buzzfeed published a report in which former employees of The Ellen DeGeneres Show accused top brass of mistreatment and discrimination, a formal investigation was launched. (DeGeneres had been dragged a few months prior on X [formerly Twitter] when a comedy writer\u2019s thread about her being \u201cmean\u201d went viral.) That September, she publicly apologized on her talk show, saying in part, \u201cI know that I\u2019m in a position of privilege and power, and I realize that with that comes responsibility, and I take responsibility for what happens at my show.\u201d\nThough the chatfest went on for two more years, the damage was done. The insider says DeGeneres felt \u201cpushed out\u201d of industry circles. \u201cThe investigation into her show was a major blow.\u201d Adds a second insider: \u201cEllen feels very burned by how the world turned on her.\u201d She addressed being canceled in her 2024 Netflix special, For Your Approval, in which she joked about being \u201ckicked out of show business.\u201d During her July 20 sit-down, she said the sting of the scandal remains. \u201cI hate that people think that I am [mean]. Because I know who I am. I know that I am an empathetic and compassionate person. And so it hurts my feelings.\u201d\nShe\u2019s now weighing her options about what to do next professionally. \u201cI am always happiest on stage,\u201d she told Bacon. \u201cIt\u2019s the best feeling.\u201d (She also said she\u2019d love to do another talk show based in the U.K., but isn\u2019t sure the format works anymore.)

      "text": "Ellen DeGeneres and her wife, Portia de Rossi, have left the United States and they don\u2019t plan to return.\nDeGeneres, 66, and de Rossi, 51, moved out of their Montecito, California home and relocated to the Cotswolds, a rural region of England about two hours outside of London, according to a report from TMZ.\nThe couple, who married in 2008, plan to sell their California property and are still mulling over how much to ask for it. They sold their other mansion, a 10-acre property in Santa Barbara County, for $96 million in August.\nDeGeneres recently concluded her \u201cEllen\u2019s Last Stand\u201d tour, which came with an accompanying Netflix special titled \u201cFor Your Approval.\u201d\nIn the special, DeGeneres opened up about being, in her words, \u201ckicked out of show business\u201d following the toxic workplace allegations that surfaced around her time hosting The Ellen DeGeneres Show from 2003 to 2022. She told the audience she is proud of who she has become in the aftermath of the scandal.\n\u201c[I\u2019m] just a multifaceted person with different feelings and emotions, and I can be happy and sad and compassionate or frustrated,\u201d she said. \u201cI have OCD and ADD. I\u2019m honest. I\u2019m generous. I\u2019m sensitive and thoughtful. But I\u2019m tough and I\u2019m impatient and I\u2019m demanding. I\u2019m direct. I\u2019m a strong woman.\u201d\nShe added that after spending her entire career worried about what other people think of her, she \u201cjust can\u2019t anymore.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard the saying, \u2018What other people think of me is none of my business.\u2019 People will say and think all kinds of things and you have no control over that. But you know the truth and that\u2019s all that matters,\u201d DeGeneres said. \u201cBut that is easier said than done. Because being in this business, I\u2019ve had to care what people think. Because being a comedian or a host, it\u2019s our only real currency for success. If they like you, you\u2019re in, and if they don\u2019t, you\u2019re out. And I\u2019ve spent an entire lifetime trying to make people happy, and I\u2019ve cared far too much what other people think of me.\u201d\nDeGeneres has made such honesty a staple of her act over the years and has been candid about coming out and the challenges she faced being a lesbian in show business.\nShe met de Rossi in 2000, three years after she first came out. Their relationship didn\u2019t turn romantic until 2004, and when it did, de Rossi said it gave her the courage to be open about her sexuality as well.\n\u201cI respect her so much. She was so courageous and so loud in \u201997, and now she is doing something that is more subliminal,\u201d de Rossi told The Advocate in 2005. \u201cShe\u2019s changing the world, she really is, and it\u2019s exciting to be a part of that.\u201d\nWhen the allegations against DeGeneres first arose, de Rossi stood by her wife and she doesn\u2019t appear to have wavered. On the couple\u2019s 16th wedding anniversary on August 16, Ellen wrote via Instagram \u201cI\u2019m so lucky to be loved by the most amazing person I\u2019ve ever met. I love you Portia. You\u2019re my everything.\u201d"

      "text": "Rosie O\u2019Donnell is settling into her new life in Ireland with her family.\n\u201cWe chose Ireland and didn\u2019t really know where to go,\u201d O\u2019Donnell exclusively told Us Weekly of her new home country while discussing her Hulu documentary special Unleashing Hope: The Power of Service Dogs for Children With Autism. \u201cAnd someone said Dalkey and I found a house online that was in Glengarry. But when the people who were helping us move in went there, there was mold in it.\u201d\nO\u2019Donnell shared that after \u201cblack mold\u201d was discovered in their home, she had to rethink their living situation for the sake of her family\u2019s health. (O\u2019Donnell moved to Ireland with her 12-year-old child, Clay, who has autism.)\n\u201c[We] could not move there, especially with an autistic child who has some allergy issues,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd so we ended up in Howth.\u201d\nWhen arriving in Howth, O\u2019Donnell and Clay stayed in an Airbnb, which was a short-term solution. Once their time was up there, O\u2019Donnell and Clay officially settled in Dublin and couldn\u2019t be happier.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a great, great school there. And Clay has done very well. And they were really welcoming,\u201d the actress recalled. \u201cAnd I love the little town, the little village. It\u2019s in the heart of Dublin, but it\u2019s still a village where you know the name of the grocer and you know the name of the cashiers. People are unbearably kind in a way that shocks me every single day.\u201d\nO\u2019Donnell announced last month that she moved to Ireland and was in the process of getting her citizenship. The former talk show host isn\u2019t the only A-List star who has relocated across the pond recently, either. Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi relocated to the English countryside last year. O\u2019Donnell confessed to Us that she hasn\u2019t been in touch with DeGeneres, 67, and was \u201cshocked\u201d by her decision to leave the U.S.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never really known Ellen to say anything political in her life, so I was surprised to read that she left because of President Trump. Like, that shocked me, actually,\u201d O\u2019Donnell told Us. I\u2019ve been a political person my whole life, not better or worse, it\u2019s just a different way to be in the world. I was very clear about the reason why I was leaving, and I don\u2019t think it came as a surprise to anyone. We\u2019re not really in each other\u2019s worlds, and it\u2019s been kind of awkward but you know what? I wish her the best. I wish that she has peace and love in her life and that she is OK.\u201d\nDespite not having the strongest relationship with DeGeneres, O\u2019Donnell doesn\u2019t have any \u201cmalice\u201d towards her whatsoever.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to fight against another gay woman. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re tenaciously opposed to each other. We\u2019re just very different people. We have had some stuff in the past that we never resolved. And not in any way as, as partners or lovers or anything like that, just as friends and comedians, but I wish her the best. I seriously do,\u201d she told Us. \u201cI think that there\u2019s enough room in the world for all of the gay comedians, and we all need to stick together because gay people are the next group to be threatened. And the way they attack trans people is absolutely terrifying. If people don\u2019t understand that they\u2019re a vital part of the LBGTQIA+ community, that\u2019s tragic because we protect our own, especially the most vulnerable.\u201d\nWhile O\u2019Donnell is putting down roots in a new country, she confessed that she misses her adult children and friends who remain in the States. Before moving, O\u2019Donnell would consistently have group phone chats with her pals. Now, she hasn\u2019t been able to jump on those treasured calls as much as she likes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been very hard because of the time zone for me to participate in that. And I really miss that,\u201d she explained, noting that she still keeps in touch with her inner circle. \u201cI call my kids, I FaceTime my kids. I have two best friends, Junie and Jackie, since I [was] 3 years old. They\u2019re really like sisters. And I talk to them all the time. I have two brothers I\u2019m very close to. I talk to them all the time.\u201d\nDespite missing her family, O\u2019Donnell said she doesn\u2019t regret her decision to move.\n\u201cI know myself enough to know that this was something I needed to do for the safety and sanity of myself and my non-binary child,\u201d she said.\nIn addition to focusing on Clay\u2019s mental health, O\u2019Donnell is ensuring that Clay is living the best life they can. O\u2019Donnell and Clay\u2019s journey is featured in Hulu\u2019s Unleashing Hope, a documentary that focuses on the impact service dogs have on families affected by autism. O\u2019Donnell was grateful to use her platform to shine a light on the value of the initiative.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really a difficult but beautiful journey,\u201d O\u2019Donnell told Us, while recalling her immediate reaction to Clay\u2019s diagnosis. \u201cI knew very much. I worked with Autism Speaks. I had seen many, many documentaries and even produced one called A Mother\u2019s Courage. There was a familiarity there and there was something that felt familiar to me.\u201d\nUnleashing Hope: The Power of Service Dogs for Children With Autism is available to stream now on Hulu."

Richard Gere pointed to his wife\u2019s heritage as his reason to move to Spain, while Rosie O\u2019Donnell headed to Ireland in 2025 after President Donald Trump began his second term.\nScroll down to see which A-listers no longer live in the U.S. \u2014 or call another country their primary residence:\nRosie O\u2019Donnell\nO\u2019Donnell revealed in March 2025 that she and child Clay relocated from New York City to Ireland that January days before Trump was sworn in as president. \u201c[I\u2019m] in the process of getting my Irish citizenship, as I have Irish grandparents,\u201d the actress explained via a TikTok video. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s going on, and that\u2019s where I\u2019ve been and what I\u2019ve been doing. And although I was never someone who thought I would move to another country, that\u2019s what I decided would be the best for myself and my 12-year-old child. And here we are.\u201d\nThe A League of Their Own actress adopted Dakota, whose nickname is Clay, in 2013 with her late ex-wife Michelle Rounds, to whom she was married from 2012 to 2015. (O\u2019Donnell adopted her four eldest children \u2014 Parker, Chelsea, Blake and Vivienne \u2014 with her first wife, Kelli Carpenter.)\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi\nNews broke in November 2024 that the former Ellen DeGeneres Show host and her wife left their Montecito, California, home and moved to the rural area of the Costwolds, which is two hours outside of London.\nDeGeneres spoke about the move for the first time in a July 2025 interview, replying \u201cyes\u201d when asked if the move was a result of President Trump\u2019s 2024 election win.\n\u201cWe got here the day before the election and woke up to lots of texts from our friends with crying emojis, and I was like, \u2018He got in,\u2019\u201d she told English broadcaster Richard Bacon at the time. \u201cAnd we\u2019re like, \u2018We\u2019re staying here.\u2019\u201d\nThe former TV host said it was \u201cabsolutely beautiful\u201d in England.\n\u201cWe\u2019re just not used to seeing this kind of beauty. The villages and the towns and the architecture \u2014 everything you see is charming and it\u2019s just a simpler way of life,\u201d DeGeneres added. \u201cIt\u2019s clean. Everything here is just better \u2014 the way animals are treated, people are polite. I just love it here.\u201d\nEva Longoria\nAfter spending much of her adult life in Los Angeles, Longoria revealed to Marie Claire in November 2024 that she and husband Jos\u00e9 Bast\u00f3n had been living between Spain and Mexico for the past few years. (The couple share son Santiago.)\n\u201cThe vibe was different,\u201d Longoria told the outlet when asked what made her want to leave L.A. \u201cAnd then Covid happened, and it pushed it over the edge. Whether it\u2019s the homelessness or the taxes \u2014 not that I want to s\u2014 on California \u2014 it just feels like this chapter in my life is done now.\u201d\nChristina Milian\nThe singer relocated her family from Hollywood to France because of her husband\u2019s heritage. \u201cMy husband is French, and we\u2019ve been together for over seven or eight years, and for, like, the last three or four years, we were commuting back and forth every six months,\u201d Milian explained during a November 2024 appearance on The Jennifer Hudson Show. \u201cAnd then we decided to commit to it last year because our kids were going to go to school.\u201d\nMilian said she loves living overseas, noting her three children are \u201call going to school in Paris. What better an opportunity than that.\u201d (Milian shares sons Isaiah and Kenna with husband Matt Pokora, whom she wed in 2020. She shares her eldest child, daughter Violet, with ex The Dream.)\nAmber Heard\nUs confirmed in May 2024 that Heard relocated from the U.S. to Spain with her daughter, Oonagh, whom she welcomed via surrogate in 2021.\n\u201cAmber doesn\u2019t want to raise a child in Hollywood,\u201d a source exclusively told Us at the time, claiming the actress \u201cnever liked the energy\u201d of Los Angeles. \u201cShe [thinks] Madrid is a more welcoming place for her. She feels safe and secure, and she\u2019s surrounded by better people where she is.\u201d\nRichard Gere\nThe Pretty Woman actor revealed in March 2024 that he planned to move to his wife Alejandra Silva\u2019s home country of Spain that fall with their two children.\n\u201cFor Alejandra, it will be wonderful to be closer to her family, her lifelong friends and her culture,\u201d Gere told Vanity Fair Spain at the time of his wife, who was born in Spain. \u201cShe was very generous in giving me six years living in my world, so it is only fair that I give her at least another six living in hers.\u201d\nGere followed through with his plans, selling his $11 million Connecticut home in October 2024. However, the actor still has a house somewhere in the New York countryside.\nShania Twain\nTwain was born and raised in Canada but moved to the U.S. once she signed her first country music contract. However, her primary residence is in Corseaux, Switzerland, with husband Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Thi\u00e9baud. In March 2023, after living in Europe for 10 years, CNN reported that she had a Golden Pass Express train named after her: the Shania Train.\nLily Collins\nThe Emily in Paris actress and her husband, Charlie McDowell, moved to Copenhagen from the States in 2023, Vogue previously reported. (The couple, who welcomed their first baby via surrogate in 2025, reportedly still have property on the West Coast.)\nWhen asked what she loves most about Denmark, Collins told Elle Denmark in September 2023, \u201cLife here is just so wonderful and so calm and bright. What I love so much is that there\u2019s so much color and, yet, it\u2019s so calm. I love being able to bike everywhere. It feels like a big city but also very intimate, and everyone is so nice.\u201d\nGeorge Clooney\nYears after marrying Amal Clooney in 2014, George picked up his life in the U.S. and bought a house in the south of France in 2021. \u201cThe property is magical,\u201d a source exclusively told Us in September 2024, noting it\u2019s the family\u2019s primary residence. \u201cThey have hundreds of acres, a vineyard and olive trees, and the kids can be outside and totally protected. There\u2019s a small village nearby with shops. It\u2019s a very simple life, and George loves it.\u201d\nGeorge and Amal, who share twins Ella and Alexander, also own a villa in Lake Como, Italy. His real estate portfolio also includes homes in New York, England and Mexico.\nPamela Anderson\nWhen the pandemic hit in 2020, Anderson chose to move back to her home country, Vancouver Island, British Columbia. \u201cA few years back, I kind of gave up at some point and needed a change,\u201d Anderson told Better Homes & Gardens in August 2024, attributing the move to how the public perceived her. \u201cI thought, \u2018Well, I guess that\u2019s just what people think of me.\u2019 I was not in a good space when I moved back to Canada.\u201d\nThe Baywatch alum added: \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened over the last few decades, but I feel now so far removed from the image of who I was. I felt very sad and lonely. I didn\u2019t feel just misunderstood, I felt like I had really screwed up, that my whole life was a bundle of mistakes. I was hard on myself, and I thought I put my family through a lot and put my kids through so much.\u201d\nJosh Lucas\nThe Sweet Home Alabama actor gushed about living in Indonesia in 2019, telling Jimmy Kimmel that the country had an environmentally-focused school that his son attended. Lucas, who is from Arkansas, shares one child with ex-wife Jessica Ciencin Henriquez.\n\u201cI have this very special 7-year-old child, and I think all of us are trying to figure out how to have an impact in the world, and for myself, the best thing I could do is give my son this extraordinary experience,\u201d Lucas said during a Jimmy Kimmel Live! appearance. \u201cBeing on the other side of the world and looking back at this madness is amazing.\u201d\nCourtney Love\nThe musician has resided in London since 2019. Love explained in March 2025 that she is in the process of getting her British citizenship.\nMelissa George\nGeorge uprooted her life from New York City to Paris in 2016, bringing her two sons along for the ride.

The couple, who welcomed son Luai in July 2023, are currently raising him in the United Arab Emirates.\n\u201cI love living in New York, but I do love the serenity and peace that I find living in the Middle East because there are no cameras in Dubai,\u201d Lohan told Entertainment Tonight in December 2017. \u201cAnd I can actually focus on what I want to do in life.\u201d"

(Harry, 40, and Meghan, 43, relocated to the United States after stepping down from their duties as senior working royals.)\n\u201cWe were home and we saw you guys, which was great,\u201d Meghan recalled to DeGeneres during a November 2021 appearance on her eponymous talk show about Halloween. \u201cWe wanted to do something fun for the kids and then the kids were just not into it at all.\u201d\nHarry and Meghan, who share 5-year-old Prince Archie and 3-year-old Princess Lilibet, also attended DeGeneres and de Rossi\u2019s vow renewal ceremony in February 2023."

      "text": "Ellen DeGeneres and wife Portia de Rossi are selling the U.K. house they moved to after permanently leaving the U.S.\nAccording to a report by The Wall Street Journal published on Tuesday, July 22, the couple\u2019s 43-acre estate in the Cotswolds, named Kitesbridge Farm, is listed for approximately $30 million.\nThe outlet noted that DeGeneres, 67, and de Rossi, 52, paid \u201cabout $20 million\u201d for the property in spring 2024, ahead of the pair relocating from California to England in the aftermath of President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection.\nIn a statement shared with the outlet on Tuesday, DeGeneres explained her family\u2019s decision regarding their original English retreat. \u201cWhen we decided to live here full-time, we knew that Portia couldn\u2019t live without her horses,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe needed a home that had a horse facility and pastures for them.\u201d\nThe couple, who married in August 2008, reportedly relocated to a nearby home in the U.K. that serves as a more appropriate base for de Rossi\u2019s animals.\nOn the market via Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, the seven-bedroom, seven-bathroom estate was \u201cimagined over the past year,\u201d per the property\u2019s listing.\nIt also features a two-bedroom guest cottage with a kitchen and sitting room, plus a heated five-car garage with its own kitchenette, a \u201cparty barn\u201d with a bar, a heated indoor swimming pool, a gym, helicopter shed, a kitchen garden, multiple outdoor living areas and a covered dining space within a courtyard.\nDeGeneres confirmed her decision to leave the U.S. during a live conversation with British broadcaster Richard Bacon on Sunday, July 20. She explained at the event, staged at the Everyman Theatre in Cheltenham, that she and de Rossi planned on living in the Cotswolds for \u201cthree months of the year, or four months of the year,\u201d but decided to stay permanently after Trump, 79, became president.\n\u201cWe got here the day before the election and we woke up to lots of texts from our friends and crying emojis,\u201d DeGeneres told the crowd at Sunday\u2019s event. \u201cWe were like, \u2018We\u2019re staying here, we\u2019re not going back, we are not leaving.\u2019 So, yeah, we bought a house that we thought was going to be a part-time house, then we decided we needed a different house, and now we\u2019re selling that house. If anybody wants a house. It\u2019s a beautiful house. It\u2019s a beautiful stone farmhouse.\u201d\nDeGeneres also touched on what she loves about life in the U.K., revealing that \u201cthe people\u201d are favorable, as is one of the nation\u2019s most famed dishes. \u201cFish and chips are delicious, yes,\u201d she said before praising the British countryside. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely beautiful. We are just not used to seeing this kind of beauty,\u201d DeGeneres explained. \u201cEverything you see is charming, and it\u2019s just a simpler way of life. It\u2019s clean and everything here is better. The way animals are treated, the way people are polite. I just love it here.\u201d"

      "text": "Bruce Willis is living in a second home amid his battle with frontotemporal dementia, wife Emma Heming Willis revealed during Emma and Bruce Willis: The Unexpected Journey \u2013 A Diane Sawyer Special.\n\u201cIt was one of the hardest decisions that I\u2019ve had to make so far,\u201d Heming Willis, 47, said in the ABC special that aired on Tuesday, August 26. \u201cBut I knew, first and foremost, Bruce would want that for our daughters. You know, he would want them to be in a home that was more tailored to their needs, not his needs.\u201d\nTheir second home is a one story house where Bruce lives full-time with his care team, which is not far from the family\u2019s first home. Heming Willis, who wed Willis in 2009, said she and their daughters \u2014 Mabel, 13, and Evelyn, 11 \u2014 spend \u201ca lot\u201d of time at the second home with Willis, including visits for breakfast and dinner. (Willis also shares daughters Rumer, 37, Scout, 34, and Tallulah, 31, with ex-wife Demi Moore.)\nThe Die Hard actor\u2019s family revealed in March 2022 he was retiring from acting after he was diagnosed with aphasia. According to Mayo Clinic, aphasia is a language disorder that affects how a person communicates. It can impact their speech, the way they write and the way they understand both spoken and written language.\nNearly one year later, Willis\u2019 family confirmed his condition had progressed to frontotemporal dementia, also known as FTD. It\u2019s an umbrella term for a group of brain diseases that affect the brain\u2019s frontal and temporal lobes, which are areas that are associated with personality, behavior and language.\nWillis\u2019 family has continued to share updates of his health journey with fans, but they gave the most intimate look inside Willis\u2019 life now on the ABC special. Heming Willis opened up about when she started noticing the first signs of her husband\u2019s cognitive health decline.\n\u201cFor someone who is very talkative and very engaged, he was just a little more quiet. And when the family would get together, he would kind of just melt a little bit,\u201d Heming Willis said during a sit-down interview with ABC\u2019s Diane Sawyer. \u201cIt felt a little removed, very cold, not like Bruce, who was very warm and affectionate,\u201d Heming Willis continued. \u201cTo go in the complete opposite of that was alarming and scary.\u201d\nSawyer, 79, interviewed Dr. Bruce Miller for the special. While Dr. Miller does not treat Willis, he is an expert in FTD, which Sawyer said tends to strike early, as the mean age of when patients are diagnosed is 56 years old.\n\u201cThis is really the unknown disease. People weren\u2019t aware of it really until the 1990s. The research on this really has just begun,\u201d Dr. Miller explained.\nHeming Willis told Sawyer that many patients suffering from FTD often go misdiagnosed as bipolar or suffering from a midlife crisis and depression. It wasn\u2019t until a brain scan that the Pulp Fiction actor was officially diagnosed with what Sawyer referred to as \u201cthe black belt\u201d of dementias.\nThe Make Time Wellness founder was told that there was nothing to be done about Willis\u2019s FTD diagnosis, that there was no cure and no hope.\n\u201cTo leave there with no \u2026 with nothing, just nothing, with a diagnosis I couldn\u2019t pronounce. I didn\u2019t understand what it was,\u201d Heming Willis said. \u201cI was so panicked. And I just remember hearing it and just not hearing anything else. It was like I was free-falling.\u201d\nHer experience is what inspired to share her family\u2019s journey in a new book, The Unexpected Journey: Finding Strength, Hope, and Yourself on the Caregiving Path, as a way to throw out a lifeline to loved ones and caregivers who are navigating similar journeys with FTD diagnoses."

      "text": "Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are engaged after two years together.\n\u201cYour English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married,\u201d Swift, 35, captioned an Instagram post on Tuesday, August 26, alongside photos of Kelce, also 35, down on one knee.\nThe couple got engaged in a garden full of flowers and looked happier than ever in a series of images. In addition to the photo of Kelce proposing, the two looked lovingly into each other\u2019s eyes in a second image. Swift also held on to the back of Kelce\u2019s head in one photo, and a fourth had her ring \u2014 an old mine brilliant cut designed by Kindred Lubeck at Artifex Fine Jewelry \u2014 on full display. The last picture showed Swift sitting with her legs thrown across Kelce\u2019s lap.\nThe NFL star\u2019s interest in the singer first made headlines in July 2023 after he attempted to give her a friendship bracelet with his phone number during her Kansas City, Missouri, Eras Tour concert. Later that month, he recounted on his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast how he had failed to meet Swift at the show. She soon reached out to him after hearing the story.\nAmid romance rumors, Swift and Kelce went public with their relationship in September 2023 when she attended one of his Kansas City Chiefs home games. She became a fixture in the stands as she cheered him on throughout the season, and he returned the favor when he traveled around the world to watch her perform, with his first visit taking place in Argentina in November 2023.\nThat same month, Kelce opened up about how he and Swift got together. \u201cThere were definitely people she knew that knew who I was, in her corner [who said]: \u2018Yo! Did you know he was coming?\u2019 I had somebody playing Cupid,\u201d he told WSJ. Magazine in November 2023. \u201cShe told me exactly what was going on and how I got lucky enough to get her to reach out.\u201d\nKelce then addressed how he adjusted to the attention surrounding Swift.\n\u201cObviously I\u2019ve never dated anyone with that kind of aura about them. \u2026 I\u2019ve never dealt with it,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, I\u2019m not running away from any of it. \u2026 The scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she\u2019s just living, enjoying life. When she acts like that, I better not be the one acting all strange.\u201d\nIn December 2023, Swift broke her silence on her relationship with Kelce, telling Time that it \u201cstarted when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell.\u201d The two \u201cstarted hanging out right after that,\u201d according to Swift.\n\u201cWe actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I\u2019m grateful for, because we got to get to know each other,\u201d she elaborated. \u201cBy the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.\u201d\nWhile Swift kept some of her past relationships under the radar, she took a different approach with Kelce.\n\u201cWhen you say a relationship is public, that means I\u2019m going to see him do what he loves, we\u2019re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don\u2019t care,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you\u2019re seeing someone. And we\u2019re just proud of each other.\u201d\nAs Swift and Kelce\u2019s romance flourished, a source exclusively told Us Weekly in December 2023 that they\u2019d \u201chad plenty of really deep conversations about their future together\u201d and tried to make \u201cas much time for each other as possible\u201d amid their \u201cincredibly busy schedules.\u201d\nMore recently, an insider revealed in April that it has \u201cbeen so refreshing for Taylor not to feel the need to hide with Travis,\u201d adding that he \u201cmakes her feel safe and protected like she has the freedom to be and act however she wants.\u201d\nPrior to their engagement, Swift had a six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn, while Kelce previously dated Kayla Nicole."
