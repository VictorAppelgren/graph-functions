      "feedback": "The draft does a solid job naming macro levers (tariffs, the big tax/spending bill) and tying them to vehicle/equipment investment and AI-enabled wealth tools, but it can be world-class by tightening the causal chain, grounding every claim in explicit 3–6 month catalysts, and dialing in the numbers and sources. Actionable edits: (1) Build a formal 3–6 month catalyst map with triggers and invalidations, anchored to verifiable data: tariffs on imported passenger vehicles at 25% (plus the broader auto-parts tariffs under consideration) from WTNT85IPR; the Big Beautiful Bill’s momentum and the noted Medicaid work‑requirement structure (80 hours/month) from EPJYXB7DX; GM’s onshore push and capex cadence (about $4B committed to U.S. manufacturing and a multi‑plant cadence that increases U.S. vehicle output toward >2M/year) from WTNT85IPR and related GM notes; Pacaso’s 10 international destinations and global TAM expansion toward $1.8T, plus Range’s AI-driven wealth platform metrics (≈2,000 high‑income members, >$6B AUM, 0% AUM fees, and productivity gains of 1–1.5% annually) from UPV3X2MQ6. (2) Quantify transmission paths with explicit numbers: price pass‑through relevance of tariffs to new-vehicle pricing; debt load from the $4T 10‑year bill; GM capacity ramp timing; Range adoption milestones; Pacaso/mogul fundraising velocity. (3) Tighten the causal chain: policy → auto pricing → GM EV/ICE mix shift → domestic manufacturing intensity → equity market/demand for cyclicals; include AI‑driven productivity as a disinflationary/DEBT‑dynamic channel (Range). (4) Structure the horizon: 0–1 months policy signals; 1–3 months tariff/pricing pass‑through and GM capex cadence; 3–6 months confirm onshore production milestones and AI wealth‑flow uptake; (5) Add 1 base case and 2 clearly articulated alts with invalidations: (A) policy and demand stay constructive if productivity keeps disinflation, (B) AI productivity accelerates more than expected vs. a scenario where tariff pass‑through accelerates inflation and debt service pressure; (C) non‑traditional assets (Pacaso/mogul) underperform or face liquidity/market‑access frictions. (6) Replace vague language with precise figures (e.g., “25% tariff,” “80 hours/month Medicaid,” “>$4B GM capex,” “>2M annual GM output,” “Pacaso +1.8T global vacation market,” “Range: 2k clients, $6B AUM, 0% AUM,” “1–1.5% AI productivity”) and ensure every numeric claim is tied to a specific ID. (7) Reconcile conflicts by noting the legacy‑auto cycle risks vs. onshoring upside and the potential for inflation to test policy efficacy; where possible, cite Deutsche Bank/other independent signals from the same source set, or omit non‑ID data. (8) Confidence labeling should be sharpened to a narrow band (e.g., 50–65%) reflecting policy uncertainty, with a clear note on sensitivity to tariff timelines and AI adoption pace.
