  "content": "A huge basin of rainwater and snowmelt dammed by Alaska\u2019s Mendenhall Glacier has started to release, and officials on Tuesday urged residents in some parts of Juneau to evacuate ahead of what could be a record surge of floodwater downstream.\n\nOfficials in recent days have been warning people in the flood zone to be ready to evacuate. On Tuesday morning they confirmed water had started escaping the ice dam and flowing downstream, with flooding expected late Tuesday into Wednesday.\n\nFlooding from the basin has become an annual concern, and in recent years has swept away houses and swamped hundreds of homes.\n\nThe Mendenhall Glacier \u2014 a thinning, retreating glacier that is a major tourist attraction in southeast Alaska \u2014 acts as a dam for Suicide Basin, which fills each spring and summer with rainwater and snowmelt. The basin itself was left behind when a smaller glacier nearby retreated.\n\nWhen the water in the basin builds up enough pressure, it forces its way under or around the ice dam, entering Mendenhall Lake and eventually the Mendenhall River. Before the basin reached the limit of its capacity and began overtopping over the weekend, the water level was rising rapidly \u2014 as much as 4 feet (1.22 meters) per day during especially sunny or rainy days, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThe threat of so-called glacier outburst flooding has troubled parts of Juneau since 2011. In some years, there has been limited flooding of streets or properties near the lake or river.\n\nBut 2023 and 2024 marked successive years of record flooding, with the river last August cresting at 15.99 feet (4.9 meters), about 1 foot (0.3 meters) over the prior record set a year earlier, and flooding extending farther into the Mendenhall Valley.\n\nLast year, nearly 300 residences were damaged.\n\nA large outburst can release up to 15 billion gallons of water, according to the University of Alaska Southeast and Alaska Climate Adaptation Science Center. That\u2019s the equivalent of nearly 23,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. During last year\u2019s flood, the flow rate in the rushing Mendenhall River was about half that of Niagara Falls, the researchers say.\n\nCity officials responded to concerns from property owners this year by working with state, federal and tribal entities to install a temporary levee along roughly 2.5 miles of riverbank in an attempt to guard against widespread flooding. The installation of about 10,000, four-foot (1.2-meter) tall barriers is intended to protect more than 460 properties from flood levels similar to last year, said Nate Rumsey, deputy director with the city\u2019s engineering and public works department.\n\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is at the start of what\u2019s expected to be a yearslong process of studying conditions in the region and examining options for a more permanent solution. The timeline has angered some residents, who say it\u2019s unreasonable.\n\nOutburst floods are expected to continue as long as the Mendenhall Glacier acts as an ice dam to seal off the basin, which could span another 25 to 60 years, according to the university and science center researchers.\n\nAssociated Press writer Becky Bohrer in Juneau contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Crammed with tourists, Alaska\u2019s capital wonders what will happen as its magnificent glacier recedes\nCrammed with tourists, Alaska\u2019s capital wonders what will happen as its magnificent glacier recedes\nJUNEAU, Alaska (AP) \u2014 Thousands of tourists spill onto a boardwalk in Alaska\u2019s capital city every day from cruise ships towering over downtown. Vendors hawk shoreside trips and rows of buses stand ready to whisk visitors away, with many headed for the area\u2019s crown jewel: the Mendenhall Glacier.\nA craggy expanse of gray, white and blue, the glacier gets swarmed by sightseeing helicopters and attracts visitors by kayak, canoe and foot. So many come to see the glacier and Juneau\u2019s other wonders that the city\u2019s immediate concern is how to manage them all as a record number are expected this year. Some residents flee to quieter places during the summer, and a deal between the city and cruise industry will limit how many ships arrive next year.\nBut climate change is melting the Mendenhall Glacier. It is receding so quickly that by 2050, it might no longer be visible from the visitor center it once loomed outside.\nThat\u2019s prompted another question Juneau is only now starting to contemplate: What happens then?\n\u201cWe need to be thinking about our glaciers and the ability to view glaciers as they recede,\u201d said Alexandra Pierce, the city\u2019s tourism manager. There also needs to be a focus on reducing environmental impacts, she said. \u201cPeople come to Alaska to see what they consider to be a pristine environment and it\u2019s our responsibility to preserve that for residents and visitors.\u201d\nThe glacier pours from rocky terrain between mountains into a lake dotted by stray icebergs. Its face retreated eight football fields between 2007 and 2021, according to estimates from University of Alaska Southeast researchers. Trail markers memorialize the glacier\u2019s backward march, showing where the ice once stood. Thickets of vegetation have grown in its wake.\nWhile massive chunks have broken off, most ice loss has come from the thinning due to warming temperatures, said Eran Hood, a University of Alaska Southeast professor of environmental science. The Mendenhall has now largely receded from the lake that bears its name.\nScientists are trying to understand what the changes might mean for the ecosystem, including salmon habitat.\nThere are uncertainties for tourism, too.\nMost people enjoy the glacier from trails across Mendenhall Lake near the visitor center. Caves of dizzying blues that drew crowds several years ago have collapsed and pools of water now stand where one could once step from the rocks onto the ice.\nManoj Pillai, a cruise ship worker from India, took pictures from a popular overlook on a recent day off.\n\u201cIf the glacier is so beautiful now, how would it be, like, 10 or 20 years before? I just imagine that,\u201d he said.\nOfficials with the Tongass National Forest, under which the Mendenhall Glacier Recreation Area falls, are bracing for more visitors over the next 30 years even as they contemplate a future when the glacier slips from casual view.\nThe agency is proposing new trails and parking areas, an additional visitor center and public use cabins at a lakeside campground. Researchers do not expect the glacier to disappear completely for at least a century.\n\u201cWe did talk about, \u2018Is it worth the investment in the facilities if the glacier does go out of sight?\u2019\u201d said Tristan Fluharty, the forest\u2019s Juneau district ranger. \u201cWould we still get the same amount of visitation?\u201d\nA thundering waterfall that is a popular place for selfies, salmon runs, black bears and trails could continue attracting tourists when the glacier is not visible from the visitor center, but \u201cthe glacier is the big draw,\u201d he said.\nAround 700,000 people are expected to visit this year, with about 1 million projected by 2050.\nOther sites offer a cautionary tale. Annual visitation peaked in the 1990s at around 400,000 to the Begich, Boggs Visitor Center, southeast of Anchorage, with the Portage Glacier serving as a draw. But now, on clear days, a sliver of the glacier remains visible from the center, which was visited by about 30,000 people last year, said Brandon Raile, a spokesperson with the Chugach National Forest, which manages the site. Officials are discussing the center\u2019s future, he said.\n\u201cWhere do we go with the Begich, Boggs Visitor Center?\u201d Raile said. \u201cHow do we keep it relevant as we go forward when the original reason for it being put there is not really relevant anymore?\u201d\nAt the Mendenhall, rangers talk to visitors about climate change. They aim to \u201cinspire wonder and awe but also to inspire hope and action,\u201d said Laura Buchheit, the forest\u2019s Juneau deputy district ranger.\nAfter pandemic-stunted seasons, about 1.6 million cruise passengers are expected in Juneau this year, during a season stretching from April through October.\nThe city, nestled in a rainforest, is one stop on what are generally week-long cruises to Alaska beginning in Seattle or Vancouver, British Columbia. Tourists can leave the docks and move up the side of a mountain in minutes via a popular tram, see bald eagles perch on light posts and enjoy a vibrant Alaska Native arts community.\nOn the busiest days, about 20,000 people, equal to two-thirds of the city\u2019s population, pour from the boats.\nCity leaders and major cruise lines agreed to a daily five-ship limit for next year. But critics worry that won\u2019t ease congestion if the vessels keep getting bigger. Some residents would like one day a week without ships. As many as seven ships a day have arrived this year.\nJuneau Tours and Whale Watch is one of about two dozen companies with permits for services like transportation or guiding at the glacier. Serene Hutchinson, the company\u2019s general manager, said demand has been so high that she neared her allotment halfway through the season. Shuttle service to the glacier had to be suspended, but her business still offers limited tours that include the glacier, she said.\nOther bus operators are reaching their limits, and tourism officials are encouraging visitors to see other sites or get to the glacier by different means.\nLimits on visitation can benefit tour companies by improving the experience rather than having tourists \u201cshoehorned\u201d at the glacier, said Hutchinson, who doesn\u2019t worry about Juneau losing its luster as the glacier recedes.\n\u201cAlaska does the work for us, right?\u201d she said. \u201cAll we have to do is just kind of get out of the way and let people look around and smell and breathe.\u201d\nPierce, Juneau\u2019s tourism manager, said discussions are just beginning around what a sustainable southeast Alaska tourism industry should look like.\nIn Sitka, home to a slumbering volcano, the number of cruise passengers on a day earlier this summer exceeded the town\u2019s population of 8,400, overwhelming businesses, dragging down internet speeds and prompting officials to question how much tourism is too much.\nJuneau plans to conduct a survey that could guide future growth, such as building trails for tourism companies.\nKerry Kirkpatrick, a Juneau resident of nearly 30 years, recalls when the Mendenhall\u2019s face was \u201clong across the water and high above our heads.\u201d She called the glacier a national treasure for its accessibility and noted an irony in carbon-emitting helicopters and cruise ships chasing a melting glacier. She worries the current level of tourism isn\u2019t sustainable.\nAs the Mendenhall recedes, plants and animals will need time to adjust, she said.\nSo will humans.\n\u201cThere\u2019s too many people on the planet wanting to do the same things,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be the person who closes the door and says, you know, \u2018I\u2019m the last one in and you can\u2019t come in.\u2019 But we do have to have the ability to say, \u2018No, no more.\u2019\u201d"

Nearby, friends helped carry boxes out of her family\u2019s garage, which was inundated this week after a lake dammed by the Mendenhall Glacier let rip \u2014 sending floodwaters into neighborhoods like hers that never had to worry about that threat before.\n\u201cWe\u2019re blessed,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody was hurt. Lots of things I love are gone, and I don\u2019t like that. But it\u2019s just stuff, you know?\u201d\nAbout 100 homes and some businesses were damaged by rapidly rising floodwaters that crested around 3:15 a.m. Tuesday, according to initial estimates. In some areas, cars floated as people scrambled to evacuate. Fischer\u2019s daughter, Alyssa, who lives across the street, said the water in the road at one point reached her hips.\nThe waters began receding Tuesday, and water levels had returned to the normal range for this time of year by Wednesday afternoon, the National Weather Service said.\nThe flooding happens because a smaller glacier near Mendenhall Glacier had retreated \u2014 a casualty of the warming climate \u2014 and left a basin that fills with rainwater and snowmelt each spring and summer. When the water creates enough pressure, it forces its way under or around the ice dam created by the Mendenhall Glacier and enters Mendenhall Lake and eventually the Mendenhall River, as it did this week.\nSince 2011, the phenomenon has at times flooded streets or homes near the lake and river, and last year floodwaters devoured large chunks of the riverbank, inundated homes and sent at least one residence crashing into the raging river.\nBut the extent of this week\u2019s flooding was unprecedented, officials said, and left residents shaken as they tried to dry out furniture, books and other belongings during a stretch of warm, sunny weather. On Wednesday, piles of garbage bags and other items \u2014 wood, boxes, sodden insulation and carpeting \u2014 dotted the curbs. A street sweeper was tackling the gray, silty grime the retreating waters had left behind.\nWhile the basin was created by glacial retreat, climate change plays almost no role in the the year-to-year variations in the volume of the flooding in Juneau, said Eran Hood, a professor of environmental science at the University of Alaska Southeast who has studied the Mendenhall Glacier for years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear that these floods will persist for some amount of time, again, on a sort of decadal timescale into the future,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are so many different competing factors that work to either increase the volume of the flood or decrease the volume of the flood that we need to be able to quantify that it\u2019s difficult to say how large floods will be in the future without much more detailed modeling of the glacier dynamics.\u201d\nAt some point, Mendenhall Glacier will retreat and thin enough that it can no longer act as a dam, Hood said.\nThe flooding is a reminder of the global risk from bursting snow-and-ice dams \u2014 a phenomenon called a j\u00f6kulhlaup, which is little known in the U.S. but could threaten about 15 million people around the world.\nJuneau, a city of about 30,000 people in southeast Alaska, is reachable only by plane or boat. It\u2019s the height of the tourist season, and the city is already struggling with a housing shortage that could limit temporary accommodations available for flood victims that might need them. Juneau also has limited rental car agencies for those whose vehicles were swamped.\nThe Mendenhall River crested at 15.99 feet (4.9 meters), a new record, topping the level during last year\u2019s flood by about a foot, and the water reached farther into the Mendenhall Valley, officials said. The city said the water reached some homes outside expected flood areas. The valley is roughly a 15 to 20 minute drive from downtown Juneau.\nAlyssa Fischer said that when she went to sleep Monday night, she didn\u2019t think she had to worry about flooding where she lives. Her dad woke her up hours later via FaceTime and alerted her to rising water outside. She helped him move his cars to higher ground, as well as her quails, before evacuating with her 4- and 8-year-old children and pets to a shelter at a local school. She said she noticed the license plate on her truck was bent from the water current.\nOn Wednesday she was relieved that damage to her property was mostly limited to a crawl space and the garage. She had boxes, rugs and other items in her yard and had a fan going to help dry out the garage.\nBut she worries about the future. When she bought the house earlier this year, it was a selling point for her that it was not on the river. After they returned home Tuesday, her 8-year-old daughter asked when the floodwaters would return.\n\u201cI think next year around this time, I\u2019ll be stressed out for sure,\u201d she said. She said she would like to see community meetings about addressing future floods events."

The river crested early last Tuesday at 15.99 feet (4.9 meters), the National Weather Service said, beating the prior record set a year earlier by about 1 foot (0.3 meters).\nThe state has an assistance program that can help with costs to repair damaged homes, with a maximum for an individual or family of $21,250. Other programs including aid to replace essential items, like clothing, and temporary housing assistance for residents displaced by the flooding. Barr did not have an estimate of how many people will need such aid."

More than 100 homes are damaged\nJUNEAU, Alaska (AP) \u2014 An outburst of flooding from a lake dammed by Juneau\u2019s Mendenhall Glacier damaged at least an estimated 100 homes in what has become a perennial hazard for nearby neighborhoods.\nThe lake formed in a basin that was left behind when a nearby glacier retreated. It fills with rainwater and snowmelt during the spring and summer and at a certain point builds enough pressure to force its way out through channels it carves beneath Mendenhall Glacier. Since 2011, the phenomenon has at times caused flooding of streets or homes near Mendenhall Lake and Mendenhall River.\nLast year, a two-story home was swept away by raging floodwaters that also undermined a condo building, prompting some residents to reinforce the riverbank near their properties. Monday night\u2019s damage was less dramatic but more widespread: Local leaders adopted an emergency resolution saying hundreds of homes were affected, including some outside expected flood areas.\nDeputy City Manager Robert Barr said Tuesday that officials were still trying to get a handle on the extent of the damage.\n\u201cI would say over a hundred homes right now,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cI\u2019m less certain about multiple hundreds. Either still possible.\u201d\nThe National Weather Service said the Mendenhall River crested early Tuesday at 15.99 feet (4.9 meters), higher than the 14.97-foot (4.6-meter) crest from last year\u2019s ferocious flood, which devoured huge chunks of riverbank.\nThis year\u2019s flooding reached farther into Mendenhall Valley. There was \u201ca lot more water in the valley, on the streets, in people\u2019s homes,\u201d Barr said. Some streets at one point had 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 meters) of water, possibly more, he said.\nHowever, there appeared to be less erosion than last year, he said.\nNo injuries were reported. Gov. Mike Dunleavy issued a disaster declaration to aid the response and recovery.\nThe river level dropped quickly Tuesday.\nThe weather service late last week said the water level in the basin had reached the top of the glacier and warned people to prepare for flooding.\nThe city also had urged residents to have an evacuation plan and to spend Monday night elsewhere. The city opened an emergency shelter, and about 40 people were there overnight, Barr said.\nHe credited increased monitoring by agencies and use of technology with helping provide more preparation time this year."

Next door, a condo building teetered on the edge of the bank, its foundation already having fallen away as erosion undercut it.\nThe destruction came over the weekend as a glacial dam burst in Alaska\u2019s capital, swelling the levels of the Mendenhall River to an unprecedented degree. The bursting of such snow-and-ice dams is a phenomenon called a j\u00f6kuhlaup, and while it\u2019s relatively little-known in the U.S., researchers say such glacial floods could threaten about 15 million people around the world.\n\u201cWe sat down there and were just watching it, and all of a sudden trees started to fall in,\u201d Amanda Arra, whose house continued hanging precariously over the river bank Monday, told the Juneau Empire. \u201cAnd that\u2019s when I started to get concerned. Tree after tree after tree.\u201d\nThe flooding in Juneau came from a side basin of the awe-inspiring Mendenhall Glacier, which acts as a dam for the rain and melted snow that collect in the basin during the spring and summer. Eventually, the water gushed out from under the glacier and into Mendenhall Lake, from which it flowed down the Mendenhall River.\nWater released from the basin has caused sporadic flooding since 2011. But typically, the water releases more slowly, over a number of days, said Eran Hood, a University of Alaska Southeast professor of environmental science.\nSaturday\u2019s event was astonishing because the water gushed so quickly, raising the river\u2019s flows to about 1 1/2 times the highest previously recorded \u2014 so much that it washed away sensors that researchers had placed to study the glacial outburst phenomenon.\n\u201cThe flows were just way beyond what anything in the river could withstand,\u201d Hood said.\nTwo homes were completely lost and a third partially so, Robert Barr, Juneau\u2019s deputy city manager, said Monday. There were no reports of injuries or fatalities.\nEight buildings, including those that fell into the water, have been condemned, but some might be able to be salvaged by substantial repairs or bank stabilization, he said. Others suffered lesser damage.\nWhile climate change is melting the Mendenhall and other glaciers around the world, its relationship to such floods is complicated, scientists say.\nThe basin where the rain and meltwater collect was formerly covered by the Suicide Glacier, which used to flow into the Mendenhall Glacier, contributing ice to it. But the Suicide Glacier has retreated as the climate warms, leaving a lake in the basin dammed by the Mendenhall.\nWhile that part can be linked to climate change, the unpredictable ways that those waters can burst through the ice dams and create floods downstream is not, they said.\n\u201cClimate change caused the phenomenon, but not the individual floods,\u201d Hood said.\nThe variability in the timing and volume of such floods makes it hard to prepare for them, said Celeste Labedz, an environmental seismologist at the University of Calgary.\nMore than half of the people at risk from glacial outburst floods are in just four countries \u2014 India, Pakistan, Peru and China, according to a study published this year in Nature Communications.\nOne of the more devastating such events killed up to 6,000 people in Peru in 1941. A 2020 glacial lake outburst flood in British Columbia, Canada, caused a surge of water about 330 feet (100 meters) high, but no one was hurt.\nBecause the ground along the Mendenhall River is largely made up of loose glacial deposits, it\u2019s especially susceptible to erosion, Hood said. The damage could have been much worse if the flood coincided with heavy rains, he said.\nChris and Bob Winter built their house about 50 feet (15.2 meters) off the Mendenhall River in 1981. It flooded for the first time in 2014, an event that prompted them to raise their house 3 feet. It flooded again on Saturday with about 3 inches of standing water, enough to soak the carpets, subflooring and drywall.\n\u201cYou just got to rip it all out,\u201d Chris Winter said. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, but we can\u2019t live in our house right now.\u201d\nShe said her biggest concern is that they are both in their mid-70s and will probably have to move south at some point.\n\u201cWe raised our family, and they\u2019re gone and nobody\u2019s in Juneau,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ll be able to sell it.\u201d\n___\nThiessen reported from Anchorage.

  "argos_summary": "The Mendenhall Glacier in Juneau, Alaska, has released a significant amount of water from a dammed basin, prompting officials to urge evacuations due to expected record flooding downstream. This annual flooding phenomenon, exacerbated by the glacier's retreat due to climate change, has caused extensive damage to homes and properties, with recent estimates indicating around 290 residences affected. City officials are implementing temporary flood defenses while studying long-term solutions, as the glacier is expected to continue acting as a dam for several decades.",
