  "content": "Russia and Ukraine exchanged 146 prisoners of war from each side on Sunday after mediation by the United Arab Emirates, the Russian defense ministry and the Ukrainian president said.\n\nThe Russian ministry said all of the freed Russians were in Belarus receiving psychological and medical assistance.\n\nUkraine also returned to Moscow eight Russian citizens, residents of the Kursk region, the ministry said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, writing on the Telegram messaging app, announced that the exchange had taken place, but gave no figures.\n\nThe president posted pictures of smiling returnees, saying most of them had been in captivity since 2022, when Russia invaded its smaller neighbor. He said a journalist taken prisoner a month after the invasion was among them.\n\nZelenskiy thanked the United Arab Emirates for its role in overseeing the swap.\n\n\"The exchanges are continuing. Perhaps that is possible because of our soldiers, who are increasing the exchange fund for Ukraine,\" the president wrote, referring to the capture of Russian servicemen.",
