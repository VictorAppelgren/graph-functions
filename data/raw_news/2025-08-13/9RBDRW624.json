  "description": "This Marvel Rivals vinyl is collector's dream",
  "content": "My current Marvel Rivals obsession has led me on an intergalactic hunt for the best bit of merchandise I can get my hands on, and I think I've found it with the Marvel Rivals: Galactic Tunes vinyl.\n\nReleased on June 27 by Mutant, in partnership with Hollywood Records and Marvel, this 15-track game soundtrack has been pressed on this stunning purple record, which is draped in cute official art matching the style of the game.\n\nBefore any music nerds get all up in arms about me calling a record merch, I'm one of you and also of the belief that records should be played and listened to, first and foremost. I've been collecting (and playing) records since I was a teenager.\n\nBefore I started to amass my own collection, I used to lovingly borrow my mum's De La Soul and Smiths records to listen to, and I still browse through them to this very day. However, video game soundtracks are some of the best bits of gaming merch you can own, record player or not, and this Marvel RIvals LP is a fine example of why.\n\nFor one, picking up this record gets you an official bit of merch for the game, which isn't always easy to come by. The hero-shooter has only been out since December 2024, and so while there's a range of Funko Pop figures, comics, t-shirts, and an Art of Marvel Rivals artbook up for pre-order for $54.99 at Amazon right now, that's pretty much it.\n\nAdditionally, even without a turntable to play it on, this soundtrack is a gorgeous collector's item. The cover features adorable art of Galactica, the in-game announcer, eating an Earth-style lollipop in that anime-esque dynamic art style the hero-shooter is now known for.\n\nThe art is so stunning that it'd make for a perfect display piece, but game soundtracks are particularly great for that, regardless. All you need to do is grab a frame like this, upsimples 12.5x12.5 Record Frame for $16.99 at Amazon, and you can pop Galactica on the wall above your gaming setup, where you play most of your Marvel Rivals matches. If it weren't for the record display stand I have sitting above my turntable, I'd do just that.\n\nA lot of love has been put into this soundtrack by Mutant, in partnership with Hollywood Records and Marvel, and that's clear as day when you first rip off its protective plastic packaging. The inner sleeve features that iconic yellow Marvel Rivals spray that fans will instantly recognize, and the record itself is made up of this gorgeous purple splatter effect, with flakes of gold streaks that perfectly match up with the Galactica cover art.\n\nThere's also a Purple Translucent version, which is the one I received here in the UK from EMP. Make sure to research which one you'd prefer ahead of time to avoid any Galactic-sized disappointment.\n\nIt helps, too, that it sounds absolutely fantastic. If you do happen to have a player at hand, the soundtrack to the game has never sounded better. The tracklisting begins with an anime-opening style track \"Rivals \u2019Til The End\" performed by Adriana Figueroa, that's energetic fist-pumping beat makes me wish we'd get a Rivals anime adaptation in the future.\n\nAs a soundtrack, it's naturally full of tracks from the game, and if you've clocked in a silly amount of hours into the game like I have, you'll instantly recognize tracks like the Path to Rivals (Login Theme) or Impending Dooms which normally plays every time I hover over the game on my PS5 homescreen.\n\nWhat I love most about this bit of merch is that it's only $33.99 at Barnes and Noble and other US retailers. Sure, you could save that and put it towards a ton of Lattice, one of the in-game currencies, to get yourself some new skins instead, but having a tangible piece of Marvel Rivals merch is worth it when there isn't a lot of merch to go around.\n\nOur guide to the best gaming headsets is full of the best PS5 headsets and the best PC headsets for gaming that would pair perfectly with the Marvel Rivals soundtrack.",

      "text": "The best PC headset for gaming 2025\nYou've always got a pick among the best PC headsets for gaming - if you play on desktop or laptop, these are your best bets\nThe best PC headsets can be the perfect tool in your PC gaming arsenal if you prefer to sit back and relax in your gaming chair, as opposed to curling up on the sofa with a controller in hand. Even if your PC setup is equipped with fancy RGB speakers or a soundbar, adding a high-end headset into the mix with sophisticated EQ software, wider surround sound support, inbuilt game presets, and a high-quality microphone can truly enhance your PC gaming adventures.\nPC players have a myriad of headsets to choose from, as the best gaming headsets are typically compatible with the PC and consoles. Better yet, headsets from brands like Razer, Corsair, Logitech, SteelSeries, and HyperX tend to have software you can download for free on your desktop that opens up more ways to tailor your audio just how you like it.\nOverall, the best PC headset is the Razer BlackShark V3 Pro. The PC headset is a monumental step up from its V2 Pro predecessor, and produces a phenomenal sound, with an incredibly wide range of sound and excellent power in the low end. Couple that with a comfortable, durable design, a plethora of handy additional features, including ANC, and it's hands-down the best PC headset on the market right now. If the V3 Pro doesn't sound like your thing, we've had hundreds of cups like them around our noggins by now, and we're rounding up all our favorites down below.\nThe Quick List\nBest overall\nThe Razer BlackShark V3 Pro takes the previous generation's medals and polishes them to perfection, with fantastic audio and premium new features, making it the best PC headset we've tested so far.\nBest for most\nThe SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3 Wireless is decked out with Bluetooth and 2.4GHz support, impressive sound, a high-quality detachable mic, fast charging, and access to 100+ audio presets, all for just over the $100 price mark for PC players.\nBest budget\nYou're still getting that excellent audio quality and 7.1 surround sound, as well as a comfortable set of cups - but the Kraken V3 X offers a far more budget-friendly entry price.\nBest wireless\nThe Arctis Nova Pro Wireless is built for more than just PC. The DAC hub means your wireless connection can spread across a multi-platform setup.\nBest battery\nBoasting a massive 300 hour battery life, the HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless packs a punch - and those numbers hold up in testing as well, even if the mic is disappointing.\nBest open back\nIf you don't like the 'locked in' effect of closed back headsets, the Virtuoso Pro is your best bet. It's open back, but the stripped back features mean it's not for everyone.\nGaming headsets have been glued to my head even longer than I've been reviewing them during my time as a gaming tech writer, and I grew up with PC gaming like the rest of us. (I even have the Grim Fandango tattoo to prove it.) That's why having a PC headset that doesn't skimp on great audio quality, a high-end mic, customization options, and one that provides the highest echelons in comfort is of utmost importance to me. Before writing about gaming audio tech, I spent years training as a professional musician, which included getting hands-on experience with studio-grade tech. This music degree, combined with my time spent reviewing headsets has since only emphasized my insistence on ensuring everyone has the best gaming audio experience possible, no matter the budget.\nAugust 12 - For this update, I added the Razer BlackShark V3 Pro as the best PC headset for gaming, over its V2 Pro predecessor. The V2 Pro is still a fantastic PC headset to grab, however, the new V3 Pro has an even more impressive sound thanks to its Razer TriForce Bio-Cellulose 50mm Gen 2 audio drivers, and higher-quality broadcast-worthy full-band microphone. Additionally, I also added the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3 Wireless as the new best for most PC headset, as unlike the previous Corsair Virtuoso Max, it piles on a ton of features from Bluetooth & 2.4GHz wireless connectivity, fast charging, and access to hundreds of audio presets all for just $109.99 / \u00a399.99, which is an impressive feat for a PC compatible pair of cups.\nThe best PC headset overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThis space in the guide used to be set aside for the Razer BlackShark V2 Pro, but now the next generation of Razer BlackShark headsets has taken its best PC headset crown. The V2 Pro is still impressive, that can't be denied. However, the V3 Pro sounds even more incredible than its V2 predecessor, and its combined wealth of features, from its up to 70 hours battery life, Windows-specific THX Spatial support, and rich-sounding detachable Razer HyperClear Full Band 12 mm microphone, has earned its rightful place as the best of this list.\n\u2705 You regularly play online with chat: The microphone on the BlackShark V3 Pro is one of the best we've tested yet, making it perfect for playing PC games online with friends.\n\u2705 You loved the comfort of the V2 Pro: The V3 Pro carries the same form factor as what came before, so if you valued the lightweight and well-cushioned nature of the V2 Pro, then you'll have an equally comfortable time with this headset.\n\u274c You'd prefer colorful colorways: Like the rest of the BlackShark line, the V3 Pro is only available in all black or all white models, and so you'll need to look elsewhere if you'd prefer a headset with a bit more pizzazz.\n\u274c You don't have the budget: If you want a new model Razer headset but can't afford the $249.99 / \u00a3249.99 of the V3 Pro, Razer also launched the Razer BlackShark V3 HyperSpeed X and the BlackShark V3 for those with smaller budgets and fewer features.\nDesign: If the design and look of the BlackShark V3 Pro is familiar, that's because Razer has stuck with the same aesthetic as the V2 Pro before it. There are some small differences, as Razer has changed things up slightly when it comes to the cushioned earcups. The fabric-covered cups now sport a leatherette base that seals sound away and a mesh topper that keeps things sweat-free and comfortable. The PC version of the V3 Pro is available in all black and all white colorways, but you do get a spot of color with some blue Sony stitching if you grab the PS5 model instead - which will still be compatible with your desktop too.\nFeatures: Like the V2 Pro before it, which used to take place on this list, the microphone of the V3 Pro is one of the main reasons why it's one of the best PC headsets on the market today. It's detachable again with this new BlackShark generation of headphones, and has been expanded to a full band mic with a 48kHz sampling rate. Our hardware team's own Tabitha Baker noted in her review that the mic produces \"extremely rich, textured vocals\" which makes other headphone mics sound flatter by comparison. The V3 Pro is also equipped with ANC, up to 70 hours of battery life on PC, EQ customization, and simultaneous Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless audio.\nPerformance: It doesn't just have its mic quality going for it, but the BlackShark V3 Pro also sounds sublime thanks to its Razer TriForce Bio-Cellulose 50mm Gen 2 audio drivers, which bring out the best of the soundtracks to games like Marvel Rivals. In her review, Tabitha also shared that she was, \"immediately enthralled by the amount of space in the low end, but the power that's put into those deeper details is even more impressive\" with this Razer headset. Paired with its previously mentioned features, like ANC, up to 70 hours of battery life on PC, and simultaneous Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless audio, make it a great follow-up to the iconic BlackShark lineup.\nVerdict: The Razer BlackShark V3 Pro is a fantastic follow-up to the V2 Pro, and has some of the best-sounding audio out of any headset available to purchase right now. If you're after a feature-filled headset for PC gaming, you don't need to look further than Razer's latest pair of cups.\nRead our full Razer BlackShark V3 Pro review for more.\nThe best PC headset for most players\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3 Wireless is the brand's latest pair of budget cups, ready to replace the Arctis Nova 1 for those who'd prefer not to be at the mercy of wires while playing the latest PC releases. At just $109.99 / $99.99 it's slightly more affordable than its Arctis Nova 5 Wireless brethern, but it manages to pile on more quality of life features, from cuter Lavender and Aqua colorways to suit more gaming setups, a detachable ClearCast Gen 2.X microphone, a new slimline 2.4GHz wireless dongle, and fast charging too.\n\u2705 You need the reassurance of a detachable mic: If you can't put your trust in a headset with a retractable mic, you can pop the boom of the Arctis Nova 3 Wireless off and be reassured that strangers won't hear your online game chatter.\n\u2705 You want lots of audio presets to play with: The Arctis Nova 3 Wireless is compatible with the SteelSeries Arctis app, giving you hundreds upon hundreds of official game audio presets at your fingertips.\n\u2705 You want complete Switch 2 support: Thanks to a new update, both Bluetooth and its 2.4GHz wireless connectivity and fully compatible with the Switch 2 if you're also a fan of the latest Ninty handheld.\n\u274c You want a more Pro sound: The 40mm Neodymium drivers are the same as found in previous SteelSeries headsets and can give justice to all your favorite games. But if you're after a more powerful sound, sticking with the brand's Pro Wireless premium alternative is your best bet.\nDesign: The Arctis Nova 3 Wireless is very similar to the Arctis Nova 5 Wireless when it comes to design, but with some minor changes. For one, all of the onboard controls have had a little mix-up. The mic mute button and volume/chat mix dial are still on the bottom edge of the left cup, however, now so are all the buttons you need to get this headset up and rolling. Instead of relinquishing the power button to the right cup, it\u2019s now confined under the dial, and when pressing a series of different combinations, it also finds itself as the pairing and quick switch button too.\nThe most striking design difference is obviously down to its bright colorway, as the headset is available in not just black and white SKUS, but also in Lavender and Aqua to suit more colorful gaming setups.\nFeatures: The Arctis Nova 3 Wireless doesn't provide many brand-new features as opposed to the rest of the SteelSeries lineup of headsets. Compatibility with the PC and a range of consoles, from the PS5, Xbox Series X/S (only with the 3X Wireless model), Steam Deck, and the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 is on show here, as is the support with the free-to-download Arctis app. Where the 3 Wireless differs is down to its fast charging support, which can give the headset up to 9 hours of juice after just 15 minutes' worth of charging - ideal if you want to take a break from Discord and give it a quick charge between PC gaming sessions.\nAudio: The Arctis Nova 3 Wireless is decked out with the same impressive 40mm audio drivers as other headsets in this list, most notably the SteelSeries Pro Wireless. With that in mind, it can conjure up the same high-quality audio, which, through my testing, let me hear every single footstep and bullet coming my way in Marvel Rivals, whether I was testing the hero-shooter on my gaming PC or my PS5 console.\nVerdict: The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3 essentially feels like a re-packaged Arctis Nova 5 Wireless but with a range of more interesting colorways to suit different gaming setup types, a detachable microphone, speedier fast-charging, and a slimmer 2.4GHz wireless dongle. If you're after a low-cost PC headset that doesn't skimp out on some of the features and impressive audio quality typically found on mid-range alternatives, the Arctis Nova 3 Wireless is an ideal all-rounder for your gaming PC needs.\nComfort | 5/5 |\nAudio | 4/5 |\nBattery | 4/5 |\nMicrophone | 4/5 |\nVersatility | 5/5 |\nBuild quality | 5/5 |\nThe best budget PC headset\n3. Razer Kraken V3 X\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Razer Kraken V3 X is a more affordable, high value for money entry point to the Kraken range.\n\u2705 You don't want to break the bank: The Kraken V3 X is perfect for those after a well-respected name (and the audio pedigree it holds) without spending too much in the process.\n\u2705 A wireless connection isn't a necessity: This is a wired headset, which means you won't be worrying about battery life. If you don't need that cord-free connection you might as well save some cash with this budget option.\n\u2705 You prefer a more subtle design: Unlike the rest of the Kraken line, the V3 X feels a lot more subtle. That's perfect for more professional use as well.\n\u274c You prioritize high quality audio: You'll get far better audio quality further up the price scale, with the Kraken V3 X sounding a little tinny compared to other more expensive entries.\n\u274c You need a 3.5mm connection: The USB only connection method is going to trip up anyone without a spare port, or those looking to double up as a console headset.\nDesign: The Kraken X takes on a familiar profile, with the same rounded cup shape as its more expensive siblings. However, things feel more stripped back here - the cups themselves don't jut out quite so far and the overall aesthetic is one of a more subtle experience. That's perfect if you're after an all-in-one device for a range of uses at and away from your gaming setup.\nFeatures: The headset has been refreshed to include the latest developments and enhancements that Razer has in its bag, but in particular, it's the microphone and the drivers which get the most attention. Both features are upgraded to almost be in line with Razer's top dog headset, the BlackShark V2: the microphone is the now Razer's Hyperclear Cardioid mic, with greater speech pickup and noise cancellation. The mic is also an excellent upgrade, though it being non-detachable will irk some folks. However, for the price, this is an excellent gaming headset, particularly for those looking to get into the pc gaming headset game, and it features all the hallmarks of Razer's audio excellence. Plus, the drivers are now Razer's own excellent TriForce beasts, offering improvements across the sound spectrum.\nAudio: In actual, everyday and gaming use, we found the sound excellent still, and the 7.1 still shines on PC - this is a PC-first gaming headset still - though it is a little tinnier than the top tier BlackShark headsets. You're not getting the full bodied, richly detailed soundstages of something with a higher price tag, but considering this is an entry level addition to the range, bargain hunters will be pleased with the result.\nVerdict: The Razer Kraken V3 X enhances its predecessor in every way and takes advantage of some of the latest advancements that Razer can offer - and packages it into a value-busting proposition.\nComfort | 4/5 |\nAudio | 3/5 |\nBattery | N/A |\nMicrophone | 4/5 |\nVersatility | 2/5 |\nBuild quality | 4/5 |\nThe best wireless PC headset\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro wireless is our favorite gaming headset overall, but where it shines brightest is in a split console and PC setup. That's why it's just been pipped to the top of this list by the more focused BlackShark V2 Pro, but is still an excellent premium option.\n\u2705 You want to invest: The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro is one of the more expensive options on the market, but if you're after an investment piece it will certainly go the distance.\n\u2705 You have a split PC and console setup: The ultra-connected hub means you can easily swap between PC and console on the fly without having to faff with physical dongles. That's perfect for anyone with a console on their desk as well as a PC.\n\u2705 You play open world games: Of course, a range of genres sound excellent through these cups, but we were most impressed by the larger soundstages afforded to open world adventures. If this is your playstyle you're going to be particularly pleased here.\n\u274c You don't play across multiple platforms: A lot of that starting price is baked into the multi-connection hub, which means anyone who won't be making the most of it isn't going to be getting the full value.\n\u274c You don't want to tinker with EQ settings: The hub is also fantastic for getting your sound balance just right - something we did need to do to get the best audio through these cups. If you're after an easier plug and play device you can head further down the price range.\nDesign: While the Nova Pro does speak the same design language as cheaper options in its range, the oblong shaped cups, comfortable ski-style headband, and premium build quality throughout means it feels all the more luxurious. It looks and feels more like a set of high-end headphones than a PC headset, though you'll still find plenty of controls onboard. Everything remains slick, secure, and subtle though - perfect if you're after an all-in-one headset for work, play, and commuting (just watch that lack of water resistance on wet days).\nFeatures: The Arctis Nova Pro is stunning in this wireless format. That's because of the handy hub in the box. This base station provides all manner of excellent features, but being able to quickly switch between a wireless connection to your console and your PC is an invaluable tool for anyone running both together. No more faffing with dongles and wires, your next system is just one click away.\nThat's not why we fell in love with the Nova Pro Wireless in our everyday play sessions, though. You can slot one battery pack into the side of the hub itself to keep it permanently charging - open up the side of the Nova Pro cup and you'll find another to hotswap easily. That's a remarkable feature meaning you'll never run out of juice again. It's so simple, we couldn't believe nobody had done it before.\nAudio: Of course, the Arctis Nova Pro wireless is doing far more than that to achieve its status. Any fan of high-end headsets will know that SteelSeries offers some of the best audio in the business, and they've doubled down for the new generation. We've always loved the SteelSeries sound signature, but have lamented the lack of bass ranges in previous releases. SteelSeries has well and truly delivered with phenomenal sound here - well-rounded, rich audio paired with excellent balancing and attention to even the most precise of details across the board. Not only that, but heading back to that hub, you can adjust all EQ settings without having to load into any complex software. That meant we could quickly scale up the footsteps without jumping into GG mid-game if our preset wasn't quite working out.\nVerdict: Yes, this is a luxury headset, so the price point is going to put some off. However, if you are mixing it up between console and PC it's well worth investing in a headset that will serve each.\nRead more: SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro wireless review\nComfort | 5/5 |\nAudio | 5/5 |\nBattery | 5/5 |\nMicrophone | 5/5 |\nVersatility | 5/5 |\nBuild quality | 5/5 |\nThe best PC headset for battery life\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless first crashed onto our shelves a couple of years ago, but it's still the best in the business for battery life. If you're going all in on longevity this is where you need to be looking.\n\u2705 You prioritize battery life: You're not going to do much better than 300 hours. If you're after a fantastic sounding headset that won't die on you too often, this is it.\n\u2705 You stick to single player: The microphone is really holding this headset back, but if you don't need to use it this is a win-win.\n\u274c You regularly play online with chat: If you do rely on a microphone on your headset, we'd avoid the HyperX Cloud Alpha wireless. The quality here isn't worth the trade off for its battery life.\nDesign: You're getting that classic HyperX aesthetic here, with those big red struts, beautifully bold red stitching, and a large logo emblazoned on each black cup. There's no other headset design like it, but it's not the best for those after subtlety. Still, with a comfortable chassis and impressively low weight considering the battery inside it, who cares what you look like, this thing feels great. Our only concern during testing came from the headband adjustment which felt just a little too loose to be truly 'locked in' during play.\nFeatures: Of course, the HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless doesn't exist for its looks, it's also got a massive battery life marketed at an incredible 300 hours. That's insane for a PC headset, easily the largest charge we've ever tested. It means you'll rarely need to reach for a cable and won't have to worry about dropping out the game too often at all. We managed to keep track of 110 hours of spent battery life during our testing and we were still at 70% charge. Considering there are other headsets that would have bailed before reaching even half that play time, this is something special.\nHyperX has, however, compromised. While it's not going to make much of a difference to solo players, competitive comms shouters be warned. Microphone quality has well and truly laid down its life for battery. We were surprised, after having good experiences with previous HyperX mics, but the model we tested only ever produced an incredibly muddy voice with crackles aplenty and very low volumes.\nAudio: Thankfully, raw audio performance is a different story entirely. At the time of our review, the HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless was one of the best sounded PC headsets we'd tested. These days there are a few models out in front - the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless has a richer texture to it and the Razer BlackShark V2 Pro keeps its competitive directional cues a lot more accurate. However, you're still getting fantastic sound here overall, with excellent balancing in more complex soundstages and a particularly keen attention to smaller detailing.\nVerdict: The HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless is the perfect PC headset for solo players who hate charging, but don't want to go to SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless price heights. The poor microphone will keep this one off the heads of more competitive players but if you're in this for single-player adventure it could be your next best friend.\nRead more: HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless\nComfort | 4/5 |\nAudio | 4/5 |\nBattery | 5/5 |\nMicrophone | 1/5 |\nVersatility | 3/5 |\nBuild quality | 4/5 |\nThe best open back PC headset\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOpen back devices haven't graced the ranks of the best PC headsets in a long time, but the Corsair Virtuoso Pro has a solid premise. This is one for streamers or those with a quiet gaming space, but if you're after a super natural audio quality and no stuffy sidetone it's a winner.\n\u2705 You're a streamer: The open back design means streamers won't have to worry about annoying sidetone or mic monitoring sounds during gameplay.\n\u2705 You prioritize audio quality over features: The Virtuoso Pro is limited in its extra features, but it prioritizes supreme audio quality instead - if you do too you're onto a winner here.\n\u2705 You have a dedicated gaming space: That open back design means sound leaks in both directions - you'll need a secluded gaming spot for full immersion.\n\u274c A wireless connection is a priority: Not only is this a wired connection but it's a particularly fiddly one if you're swapping a mic in and out of your session.\n\u274c You play in a busier environment: We'd recommend a headset with noise isolation (or at least a closed back design) if you're playing in a louder space.\nDesign: The Corsair Virtuoso Pro has a particularly eye-catching design. The flatter cups are adorned with super slick grill areas (hiding a neat little logo easter egg in the center). This is a departure from the chunkier form factor we're used to seeing with the RGB Wireless XTs at the top of our list, but it's still an aesthetic that could certainly be mistaken for a high end set of headphones. The build quality is also solid - as it has to be for such a lightweight device. Aluminum runs throughout the construction, with firm cushioning supporting each cup.\nFeatures: This being a standard wired open back PC headset, there's no power functions to speak of. That means onboard controls are non-existent (you'll be relying on your PC or gaming keyboard's volume controls here) and there's no customization or preset options either. The Pros are set up to work alongside Corsair's Wave XLR microphone control pad, though, so streamers are sorted for mixing.\nEveryday players might struggle with this feature set, though. Going from the control-packed PC headsets we usually test to this more barebones approach was tough during testing, and the need to swap cables when going from a mic session to a solo adventure was frustrating as well.\nAudio: An open back PC headset like this lives and dies by its audio, and while the Virtuoso Pro keeps things minimal elsewhere it absolutely shines in its soundstage. Across Starfield and even more competitive titles we noticed a particularly natural sound quality here, with exquisite detailing and a robust sense of direction. Graphene drivers are pushing this audio quality forward, but in combination with the open back design this is a particularly pleasing experience.\nVerdict: The Corsair Virtuoso Pro suits a more niche market - namely streamers, or those who have the sound proofing and space to go all in on a natural, breezy soundstage. Audio quality is the main draw here, so if you can forego the usual additional extras this is a fantastic pick.\nRead more: Corsair Virtuoso Pro review\nComfort | 4/5 |\nAudio | 4/5 |\nBattery | N/A |\nMicrophone | 4/5 |\nVersatility | 2/5 |\nBuild quality | 5/5 |\nPC Headsets Coming Soon\nPC headset news: This month, Razer launched the Pokemon Collection, which takes existing Razer accessories, like the Razer BlackWidow V4 X gaming keyboard and the Razer Cobra gaming mice, and gives them a Pok\u00e9mon-themed coat of paint. This collection also includes a new Pokemon Edition of the Razer Kraken V4 X headset, which now features a yellow and black colorway and a headband with imagery of Pikachu and the original starters, Squirtle, Charmander, and Bulbasaur.\nIncoming PC head reviews: Currently, I've got plenty of PC gaming headsets on my testing bench, from the Logitech G522 Lightspeed to the Fractal Design Scape, along with plenty of other PC-compatible pairs of cups that are bound to qualify as part of this list.\nHow we test PC headsets\nWe test gaming headsets almost every day, constantly thinking about what it takes for them to be considered one of the best PC headsets for gaming out there - the lucky few make this list. Each member of this esteemed club has good sound quality and is comfortable for those longer playing sessions. Some offer more features and better audio than others, but usually, that bump in quality comes with a bump in price too.\nIt's easy to get hung up on stats like frequency response, range, and the size of the drivers inside each headset, but there's no real substitute for putting the headset on and seeing how it performs with actual games. That's what we do. We test headsets in online shooters like Marvel Rivals and CS2, to see how the surround sound performs, and we test in epic single-player games like The Last of Us Part 2 and Marvel's Spider-Man to see how the music, dialogue, and environmental ambiance comes through. We test titles with particularly complex audio components, like Doom Eternal and Horizon: Forbidden West, to see how well each range is balanced in the soundstage.\nGames like Dead by Daylight are also used to see how any given headset copes with a more atmospheric soundscape, and how it places voice chat within it. While Sea of Thieves is the perfect tester to put any spatial audio support to the test, to see how any PC headset handles playing its audio in a 3D environment. Outside of our main game choices, what games are used during testing can differ depending on any given reviewers' access. At times, that can mean brand-new releases are included, which is always a plus, as seeing how modern gaming headsets cope with new releases can be pivotal in the reviewing process.\nAside from your actual audio experience, we also measure a PC headset's design and features according to several objective principles.\nWe're constantly checking on build quality across all elements, including materials, joints, hinges, cushioning, and portability, while also thoroughly exploring the comfort of a device across a range of different head shapes.\nIn the world of features, we're looking at which connections are on offer, as well as their versatility, reliability, and speed, as well as the number and placement of onboard controls. We compare microphone properties and software offerings (as well as how intuitive it is to access them) as well as battery life, charging ease, charging speed, and power savings features as well. All of that is directly compared against other PC headsets within a similar price category by using each device side by side, rather than just referring back to our notes. That's because every PC headset we test stays within our rosters for years to come so that we can accurately map the market's best value at all times.\nOnce a review is published, we evaluate each PC headset based on a series of scores across; comfort, audio, battery, microphone, versatility, and build quality to see if they make it into this top guide. PC headsets must score 5/5 in at least one category to be considered for the guide, though our 'best budget' category is a little more flexible with this rule.\nYou can find out more about how we test gaming headsets on the full GamesRadar+ Hardware Policy.\nAlso Tested\nNacon RIG 900 Max HS | Available at Nacon\nThe Nacon RIG 900 Max HS is a premium wireless headset designed for PS5 players, but its Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connectivity also make it PC compatible. At $249.99 / \u00a3209.35 it also packs in a flip-to-use mic, unique design, and app support with a range of EQ audio customization, but its wireless charging stand is where it shines the most. While its charging stand almost entirely puts an end to any charging woes, this headset's low-quality mic means it doesn't quite earn a spot on the list.\nSennheiser HD 550 gaming headphones | Available from Sennheiser\nThe Sennheiser HD 550 gaming headphones are just that, headphones, and so they can't qualify as part of the best PC headset list. Not only that, but the HD 550's $349.99 / \u00a3249.99 price point puts them on the same playing field as alternatives like the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless, but they lack any of the same premium features. Essentially, the Sennheiser HD 550 is just a wired headset, which comes with a jack adaptor, and is open-back to produce a more natural sound. Any PC players who want to begin their audiophile audio journey will get a kick out of these headphones, but those who want to chat away to friends on Discord will find limited use with the lack of a microphone.\nCorsair Void Wireless V2 | Available at Amazon\nThe Corsair Void Wireless V2 is the latest budget pair of cups in the Void line, but while it's low in price, it's high on quality. At $119.99 / \u00a399.99, the Void V2 still manages to pack in custom 50mm Neodymium drivers, which makes the sound of every game sound powerful and its bass punchy, not to mention a great-sounding microphone, and two strips of customizable RGB lighting. Its earcup shapes and clamping force make it a bit awkward for glasses wearers, and it's much pricier than the Razer Kraken V3 X, which is why it hasn't earned a spot on this list quite yet. However, if you'd prefer to spend more for great audio quality, Bluetooth, and 2.4 wireless connectivity, the Void V2 is an ideal alternative.\nCorsair Void Wireless V2 review\nOXS Storm G2 wireless headset | Available at AmazonThe OXS Storm G2 wireless gaming features a unique design thanks to its off-white colorway and space-age markings, and is compatible with gaming PC's via a wired connection, Bluetooth, or its accompanying 2.4GHz dongle. PC players definitely have the most options when it comes to this budget sub $100 headset, and it comes with a surprisingly good detachable mic and pretty subdued RGB lighting. However, its lackluster sound and build quality make alternatives like the Razer BlackShark V2 Hyperspeed more ideal for PC players despite the slightly higher price point.\nOXS Storm G2 wireless headset review\nTurtle Beach Stealth 700 Gen 3 | Available at AmazonThe Stealth 700 Gen 3 is the latest headset to join the Stealth line, and is one of the best-sounding pair of cups I've ever tested, thanks in part to its premium 60mm dual eclipse audio drivers. At $199.99 / \u00a3179.99, the Stealth 700 Gen 3 is a bit pricier than its mid-range rivals, and although it keeps sound enclosed with its bulky cups, it doesn't quite live up to the comfort set by the Razer BlackShark V2 Pro.\nAlienware Pro Wireless headset | Available at Amazon\nThe Alienware Pro Wireless gaming headset is a mid-range pair of cups with a $229.99 / \u00a3221.99 price point. While it's pricier than other mid-range cups, it sets itself apart with its active noise canceling and wider 20Hz - 40kHz frequency range while still ensuring a comfy fit. On PC this headset shines the most, offering up customizable options through the optional Dolby Atmos software. However, alternatives like the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless headset remain a better option for PC owners because of its flexible mic and hot-swappable batteries.\nAlienware Pro Wireless headset review\nReviewed January 2025\nAsus ROG Delta II | Available at Amazon\nThe Asus ROG Delta II headset can simultaneously connect to consoles and PC platforms via Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz and brings a plethora of premium new features to the Asus headline line. At $229 / \u00a3219, while an impressive piece of tech, it feels like a weaker package compared to Razer's BlackShark V2 Pro which provides a more vibrant sound quality and is already part of this list.\nAsus ROG Delta II review\nReviewed January 2025\nRazer Barracuda X Chroma | Available at Amazon\nThe Razer Barracuda X Chroma (2024) introduces RGB lighting to the Barracuda lineup for the first time and still manages to uphold the sound and build quality that the previous headsets established. The multi-platform excellence providing an easy switch between Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless connections is still on full display, but this flashy add-on comes at a cost of $129.99/\u00a3129.99 making the previous model a more budget-friendly PC headset.\nRazer Barracuda X Chroma review\nReviewed December 2024\nTurtle Beach Stealth 500 | Available at Amazon\nThe Turtle Beach Stealth 500 is a solid budget headset, but its value will be better felt by multiplatform players. It's a competitor for the Razer Kraken V3 X, but prioritizes its wireless connection while dropping down a rung in sound and build quality.\nTurtle Beach Stealth 500 review\nReviewed August 2024\nTurtle Beach Atlas Air | Available at Amazon\nThe Turtle Beach Atlas Air is actually our favorite open back gaming headset overall, but the Corsair Virtuoso Pro clinches the deal for PC players with its improved mic and extra streaming features.\nReviewed June 2024\nTurtle Beach Stealth 600 Gen 3 Wireless | Available at Amazon\nThis is actually an excellent value headset, offering wireless connectivity and a solid design for just under $100. However, it's not quite cheap enough to worry the Razer Kraken and doesn't pack the same punch as the Razer BlackShark V2 Hyperspeed.\nTurtle Beach Stealth 600 Gen 3 Wireless review\nReviewed June 2024\nHyperX Cloud 3 Wireless | Available at Amazon\nThe HyperX Cloud 3 Wireless still offers one of the best battery lives we've seen in a PC headset, but its lack of extra connection options holds it back.\nHyperX Cloud 3 Wireless review\nReviewed June 2024\nSteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X | Available at Amazon\nThis is a fantastic headset, taking the drivers and audio quality from the Nova 7 and adding extra EQ features. The Nova 5 is definitely more geared towards a console crowd than PC, however.\nSteelSeries Arctis Nova 5 Wireless review\nReviewed May 2024\nCorsair HS80 Max | Available at Amazon\nThe Corsair HS80 Max is a solid mid-range headset, but it's got stiff competition in the BlackShark V2 Hyperspeed and with a lower quality microphone it just loses the matchup.\nReviewed April 2024\nAstro A50 X | Available at Amazon\nThis is a beast. The Astro A50 X is a particularly expensive headset that excels in a multi-platform setup. If you're running a PS5 or Xbox next to your PC it's a must-see, but its feature list (and price tag) is bloated for pure desktop use.\nReviewed February 2024\nSony Inzone H5 | Available at Amazon\nThe Sony Inzone H5 is one of the brand's more recent attempts to jump in on the PC crowd. While it's particularly comfortable and offers a nice soundstage, it's stuck in between PC and PS5 features without really ever satisfying either platform.\nReviewed November 2023\nLogitech G Pro X 2 | Available at Amazon\nThe Logitech G Pro X 2 looks and feels great, with all the features you'd expect to see in a refresh. Its microphone doesn't quite match up to the BlackShark V2 Pro, though, and its USB-A receiver could get in the way.\nReviewed July 2023\nSteelSeries Arctis Nova 4 | Available at Amazon\nThe Nova 4 has largely been surpassed by the Nova 5 nowadays, with a similar price tag and far shorter feature list. This is a solid device in its own right, but against the rest of the market it struggles to prove its worth.\nSteelSeries Arctis Nova 4 review\nReviewed June 2023\nRIG 800 Pro HS | Available at Amazon\nIf you want the charging dock of the Astro A50 X without the astronomical price, the RIG 800 Pro HS might make some sense. It's a little lackluster in both sound quality and build, though, and runs some seriously outdated connections.\nReviewed May 2023\nTurtle Beach Stealth Pro | Available at Amazon\nThe Turtle Beach Stealth Pro is a powerhouse, but it's been overtaken by the Astro A50 X for multiplatform uses and doesn't quite offer the kind of competition the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless needs to be knocked off its thrown. Still, if you're after ANC, hot-swappable batteries, and a chunky design this is still a winner.\nTurtle Beach Stealth Pro review\nReviewed April 2023\nHow to choose a PC headset\nOf course, the very best PC headsets cost a pretty penny - but you can whittle that final cost down if you already know which features you want to prioritize. You can make sure you're choosing the right PC headset for you if you already know which of these elements are must-haves. For example, if you want to go all out on surround sound but don't need a wireless connection you'll find a range of more focused wired models on the market. Or, if you're prioritizing that 2.4GHz freedom but only play single player games, you can drop down a level in microphone quality to spend less as well.\nOnce you know what you need, you'll need to decide how much you want to spend. There are some features (like simultaneous Bluetooth connections or high-end graphene drivers) that will automatically catapult you near to the top of the price range. However, there are other sacrifices that can be made to find the model offering the right specs for you.\nIn general, PC headsets move up along a similar price trajectory, adding or improving features as they get more expensive. You can work out exactly what you'll be paying for each experience just below, but it's worth remembering that this is a generalization - there will always be outlier devices that focus more on specific areas by deprioritizing others.\n$10 - $40\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nThis is the ultra-budget category, where you'll be limited to a wired connection and lower quality dynamic drivers. That's not to say the audio is going to be bad at this price range, but it's going to be more restrictive in its soundstage, might not offer surround sound technology, and will likely suffer from distortion at higher volumes, particularly in the bass range.\nBudget PC headsets like this can make for excellent value if you just need audio for as little as possible, though. You'll still be able to find a microphone, though it likely won't include any noise cancellation features and the vast majority are non-detachable which could be an inconvenience for solo players.\nPC headsets in this price category tend to be produced using lower quality materials, which means they won't have as long a lifespan as a more premium option. Be sure to keep hinges and any leatherette earcups safe to extend its life.\n$40 - $80\nThis is where I'd recommend the majority of casual players begin their search. The $40 - $80 price bracket introduces a few cheaper 2.4GHz wireless options, and you'll notice a slight jump in audio quality as well. These headsets are more likely to use temperature-controlling mesh earcups for extra comfort and could come with additional padding around the headband as well.\nBrands still won't be plugging their highest-quality drivers into these headsets, but this price range does open you up to more surround sound options on PC. Towards the top end of that bracket you may also find dedicated EQ software included in the package as well.\nYour microphone will likely be solid, though might not feature more premium qualities like active noise cancellation or super wideband frequencies.\n$80 - $150\nThis is the real mid-range, where wireless headsets start to take the lead away from wired alternatives (especially at the top end of that bracket) and additional Bluetooth support starts to enter the fray. That can wildly open up your compatibility, meaning these headsets can be used with Nintendo Switch, mobile, or as everyday commuting headphones.\nYou'll notice a larger jump in sound quality here, especially if you're buying a cheaper version of a more premium release (like Razer's X or Hyperspeed lines). For example, the Razer BlackShark V2 Hyperspeed and SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5 are both square in the middle of this price bracket, and both use the exact same drivers and microphones as their more expensive counterparts.\nWe tend to see PC headsets prioritizing internal features and sound quality before they tackle build, though, so devices in this price range will still likely feel a little cheaper in the hands and we'd still recommend care when adjusting hinges.\n$150 - $250\nThere's a slight jump in feature sets when moving above $150, but the gears really start to shift once you're over that $200 mark. If this is where you find yourself, though, you can expect a boost in clarity and soundstage as headsets start to employ their more premium drivers. Comfort and build quality do take a slight jump at this price point, and most devices you'll be looking at will offer both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connections, with the ability to easily switch between the two on the fly.\n$250 - $400\nThis is the high-end market, where headset manufacturers put their best horses into the race with the latest drivers, unique features, and robust build qualities. Things do start to become a little more specialized here, though, so I'd recommend doing your homework. You'll start to see cheaper audiophile selections in here, with alternative planar driver types, graphene diaphragm materials, and additional tuning. Between hot-swappable batteries, multi-platform connection hubs, and built-in charging docks, there are plenty of cool extras included in this price range.\nGlossary\n- ANC: Active Noise Cancellation: A process that stops external sounds from interrupting you while you play but using a microphone to pick up unwanted audio and a separate sound frequency to block it out.\n- Closed-back: A headset design that keeps the driver fully enclosed within the chassis of the device. This provides a natural sound isolation that prevents unwanted noise bleed in either direction.\n- Distortion: Distortion occurs when sound waves are disturbed by high-volumes or improperly tuned drivers, most frequently in the lower ranges.\n- Driver: The part of your headset responsible for converting electrical signals into sound waves, therefore producing audio.\n- EQ: Many PC headsets offer EQ software to help you fine-tune your listening experience. This comes in the form of a customizable graph plotting the emphasis of each audio range.\n- Frequency range: The scale of frequencies (low to high) that a gaming headset is capable of producing - usually sitting at between 20Hz and 20kHz.\n- Latency: The speed at which you hear in-game events through a headset. Latency is usually referred to when discussing wireless PC headsets, as the 2.4GHz or Bluetooth connection may be slower than a cable.\n- Open-back: A headset design where the driver is left open and unhoused, creating a wider soundstage but sacrificing noise isolation in both directions.\n- Preset: A customized EQ selection that can be applied to certain games and automatically applied when you load that game.\n- Soundstage: The imagined space that the audio from a gaming headset creates around you as you're playing.\n- Virtual surround sound: The process of creating a series of virtual speakers to simulate a surround sound setup, usually with seven points of audio and one bass center (hence, the 7.1 surround sound descriptor).\nBest PC gaming headset: FAQ\nWhat is the best headset for gaming on a PC?\nEveryone will have their favourite PC gaming headset but there really isn't one that can be pointed to for 100% of users and needs. The best headset for PC we've tested so far is the Razer BlackShark V3 Pro, but it's not going to fit all uses.\nHowever, it's best to think about what you need from a headset, and the pieces will start to fall into place. For example, when you start drawing lines in terms of price tag, you'll start to get closer to the best headset for you, and then you can make calls like going wireless or staying wired, which features are must-haves, and so on. This is the way to find the best headset for gaming on a PC, for you.\nWhich PC headset brand is the best?\nThe PC gaming headset market is a rich and diverse, and very full, one. As a result, and because a lot of brands have been going at this for a while, there really isn't just one brand that sits above the rest for everyone.\nHowever, plenty of brands are perennially reliable and excellent, and you can barely go wrong with anything from them. The likes of Razer, Astro, SteelSeries, Corsair, Logitech G, and HyperX are all favourites with lots of gamers for good reasons. And while each will be slightly different, and offer slightly different features and audio executions, they will all fit differently due to build and comfort, price, and flexibility. Be aware of exactly what you need when you start off and you'll soon whittle it down.\nIs a wired or wireless headset better for gaming?\nBack in the day, even the best wireless gaming headsets couldn't keep up with game audio. That meant high latencies, missed shots, and late directional cues. With the super-fast 2.4GHz connections we have today, though, those issues are all ironed out. These days the speed difference between a wired and wireless connection is negligible - though if you're a pro playing competitively you might still prefer the reliability of a wired cable. While casual players won't notice the difference in connections, though, the choice between a wired or wireless PC headset comes down to battery and comfort preferences.\nAfter all, playing on a PC means you don't have to worry so much about cable length when at your desk (and you can take advantage of USB-connecting headsets). That means you might prefer a wired headsets to avoid having to charge the device, especially if you don't mind having an extra wire on the desk.\nIf, however, you plan on using your headset as a regular set of headphones when out and about - or you want to connect to other devices without tethering - wireless is the way to go.\nWhat headsets do pro gamers use?\nMost of the biggest brands and manufacturers are represented at the top of the esports table - Logitech, Razer, EPOS, and more are all present among the top teams. But such is the accessibility and sometimes downright affordability of the top sets, looking at what the pros use and aiming to replicate that has actually never been easier; the gap between everyday gamers and the pros is not as wide as some might think.\nAnd remember, the headset market covers a lot of ground: check out the best PS5 headsets, the best Xbox Series X headsets, and the best Nintendo Switch headsets to cover your bases and round out your research thoroughly.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nEver since I first held a NES controller in my hand I've been obsessed with gaming, and the hardware it runs on. I could hook up a NES and SNES to a telly, without instructions, before I could walk. Even now, nothing is more exciting then taking a console, or handheld, out the box for the first time and setting it up. This obsession transformed into a love of games and game music, which lead to my music degree and dream of becoming the Scottish Nobuo Uematsu. After sharing my love of games through music, I began to share my love through words on sites like TechRadar and iMore. This lead to becoming a Hardware staff writer for PCGamesN, and later the Senior Tech Writer for Dexerto, covering all things Steam Deck, PlayStation and Nintendo. With that experience, I was able to level up as Hardware Editor for GamesRadar+, where I'm still just as Nintendo, PlayStation and gaming tech obsessed as ever.\n- Rob Dwiar\n- Tabitha BakerManaging Editor - Hardware"

      "text": "I have an adult job with adult money, but why are there still no Marvel Rivals PS5 accessories to spend it on?\nGive me a Jeff the Land Shark DualSense controller, stat\nMarvel Rivals PS5 accessories don't exist quite yet, but you can still pre-order the official Art of Marvel Rivals book for $54.99 at Amazon if you adore the dynamic art style as much as I do.\nLast month, Sony fans were treated to a restock of the 30th anniversary PS5 DualSense controller, one of the best-looking PS5 accessories in existence. As I jealously gazed my eyes upon the nostalgia-inducing gamepad and spared a thought for the recently released official limited edition Death Stranding 2 DualSense, a thought occurred to me - why can't I buy an official Marvel Rivals PS5 DualSense controller?\nThe quick answer is that they don't exist. Neither does any kind of officially licenced PS5 hardware, from console covers to stick grips, with any of the stunning art style from the hero-shooter. Marvel Rivals merchandise is out there, however. There's naturally a line of Funko Pops plastered with the Rivals branding, a Marvel Rivals artbook is available to pre-order for $54.99 at Amazon, and I recently even purchased the soundtrack on vinyl.\nYet, despite that, and Sony's history of limited-edition Marvel-branded hardware, I can't throw money at a controller with Spider-Man's dorky face, or give my Sony console a makeover with Scarlet Witch console covers, and that feels like a big, Galacta-sized missed opportunity.\nWhen Marvel's Spider-Man 2 launched back in 2023, it brought along with it one of the snazziest PS5 bundles in the console's almost 5-year lifespan. I'm still obsessed with the limited edition console, that I own third-party console covers from Dbrand that look awfully similar. They don't capture the exact magic of the glorious print, which features that dazzling Spider-Man red being slowly overtaken by the creepy black, tendrils of Venom, but it's close.\nClose enough to make me feel like I own some cool official Marvel PS5 hardware, when in reality, I don't. The real-deal also came with a matching PS5 controller, which looks so flashy it makes me yearn for the Marvel Rivals roster of characters to get the same treatment. Being able to swiftly escort the Spider-bot through the streets of Shin-Shibuya would be all the more satisfying if I could do so on a controller smothered with the Rivals Spider-Man art instead.\nThe online hero-shooter is known for its stunning \"dynamic comic style\" and aesthetic. I mean, there wouldn't be a Marvel Rivals artbook and a Marvel Rivals poster collection up for pre-order for $29.99 at Amazon, if the gorgeous sketchty stylings by Art Director Dino and his team weren't popular enough.\nHaving a limited edition DualSense controller for all of the 40 playable characters (41 when you include Blade, who drops with the Season 3.5 update this week) might be a big ask. There aren't even 40 variants of the controller in the five years since the PS5 has existed. But I'd clear out my savings in order to have my mains, Cloak and Dagger, Invisible Woman, and Scarlet Witch on controllers, console covers, and even stick grips.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nEach character's circular emblem, which appears on screen after re-watching your match highlights, would transfer perfectly to stick grips. KontrolFreek has done plenty of officially licensed grips in the past, and most recently launched official Minecraft stick grips for the PS5 DualSense, so licensed versions do exist. In lieu of ones of the Marvel RIval variety, I can at least stick with my bootleg Spidey ones for now, but I'd much rather have an excuse to own more official Marvel merch instead.\nI'd this point, my obsession with Marvel is only on the up and up. The latest Spider-Man film, Spider-Man Brand New Day, is filming in my very city, and season 3.5 of Marvel RIvals drops this very week, so I've never wanted official Marvel Rivals PS5 accessories more in my many years spent with Sony's current-gen console.\nI'd even take other brands from Razer to SteelSeries, tackling the license themselves, and producing Marvel Rivals versions of their existing products. It wouldn't be too much of a stretch, as Razer has dabbled in Marvel Rivals promotions in the past, providing access to the Doctor Strange Master of Black Magic costume if you were lucky enough to buy a limited edition bundle of products.\nGrabbing a Luna Snow version of Razer's latest BlackShark V3 Pro gaming headset would be an incredible way to complete my weekly in-game challenges, and it'd feel pretty on brand too for the K-pop star Marvel hero. However, sadly, these cool bits of PS5 hardware only exist in my head, and I'll have to stick with my off-brand Spidey accessories for now.\nHopefully, Marvel Rivals' growing lineup of merchandise will spill into the world of PS5 hardware someday soon, so I look down and see Jeff the Land Shark's adorable smile while I'm evily eating up my enemies and throwing them off a cliff. In the meantime, at least there's plenty of costumes on the in-game store that I can spend my hard-earned, nerdy cash on instead.\nCheck out these Marvel PS5 goodies...\n- PS5 Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Collector's Edition: $229.99 at PS Direct\n- Marvel\u2019s Guardians of the Galaxy: $49.99 at Amazon\n- Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales:\n$49.99$29.99 at Amazon\nGrabbing one of the best SSDs for PS5, the best PS5 headsets, or one of the best PS5 cheap game deals can help unlock the full potential of your Sony gaming setup.\nEver since I first held a NES controller in my hand I've been obsessed with gaming, and the hardware it runs on. I could hook up a NES and SNES to a telly, without instructions, before I could walk. Even now, nothing is more exciting then taking a console, or handheld, out the box for the first time and setting it up. This obsession transformed into a love of games and game music, which lead to my music degree and dream of becoming the Scottish Nobuo Uematsu. After sharing my love of games through music, I began to share my love through words on sites like TechRadar and iMore. This lead to becoming a Hardware staff writer for PCGamesN, and later the Senior Tech Writer for Dexerto, covering all things Steam Deck, PlayStation and Nintendo. With that experience, I was able to level up as Hardware Editor for GamesRadar+, where I'm still just as Nintendo, PlayStation and gaming tech obsessed as ever.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "The fact that you can still buy 19 inches of Venom with the Spider-Man 2 Collector's Edition has my Spidey sense tingling\nThe Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Collector's Edition is still up for grabs\nRight now, you can still buy the Marvel's Spider-Man 2 Collector's Edition set for the PS5.\nYou know the one that comes with a digital copy for one of the best PS5 games, and that massive 19-inch Venom statue, where he's battling it out with Peter Parker and Miles Morales while the creepy symbiote tendrils menacingly lift him into the air? Well, it's available for $229.99 at PS Direct despite the fact that the game launched way back in October 2023, and I'm trying to use all my strength and willpower not to buy it.\nIt's not the price that's putting me off, but the struggle of fitting 19 inches worth of spectacular Spidey goodness into my life. There's only so much shelf space I can spare for more Marvel merch, and that's a whole lot of Venom that I'll need to accommodate, tendrils in all.\nMarvel's Spider-Man 2 Collector's Edition for PS5 | $229.99 at PS Direct\nIf you missed out on the collector's edition the first time around, you can still grab the box full of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 goodies through PS Direct right now, including that glorious 19-inch Venom statue. The collector's box set also includes a digital voucher copy of the game, a steelbook display case, all the pre-order bonus items including an early unlock for the Arachknight Suit for Peter, an early unlock for the Shadow-Spider Suit for Miles, and all the digital deluxe edition in-game content, which includes even more suits for Peter and Miles.\nBuy it if:\n\u2705 You missed owning the Collector's Edition at launch\n\u2705 You're a big Spidey fan\n\u2705 You want 19 inches of Venom in your life\n\u2705 You want all the exclusive in-game Spidey suits\nDon't buy it if:\n\u274c You've already played Marvel's Spider-Man 2\n\u274c Venom isn't your favorite Spidey baddie\n\u274c You aren't a fan of collector's edition statues\nCollector's Editions don't usually stick around for long. Weeks, and in some cases even days, after a big game's release, you'll only going to find them in the window displays at GameStop amongst other over-priced PS5 accessories. or copies across every second-hand auction site you can imagine in the US. So I'm shocked this is still available to buy.\nShocked but happy, as it's a PlayStation Direct exclusive, I remember the difficulty of finding this edition in stock shortly after launch. Finding the Venom statue anywhere but eBay at the time got so stressful that it's why I stuck with a physical copy of just the game instead.\nIt didn't disappoint, and I have the Platinum trophy to prove it. But as a big Spider-Man nerd, I can't pretend I wasn't thinking about the 19-inch Venom statue, steelbook case, and all the in-game suits and goodies I could have had access to, had I had the collector's edition been available online for a little while longer.\nI'm not sure if PlayStation Studios and Insomniac Games just made an extra batch of Venom statues to appease Spidey fans like me who missed them the first time around, or a fresh box of collector's editions was found by a PS Direct staff member at the back of a warehouse somewhere, but I'm glad they're now more readily available.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nCollector's editions of games being this exclusive commodity has never sat right with me. They tend to be pretty pricey, and their short lifespan on the digital shelves makes them even more prone to being exclusive for those with the cash to spare. I've even pre-ordered a collector's edition (the Clock Tower Rewind Collector's Edition by Limited Run Games) purely as I knew I'd not be able to buy it for its retail price in the future - and I still feel gross about it.\nHaving them still in stock years after launch, like with this Spider-Man 2 edition, gives Spidey fans with smaller budgets a chance to save and grab the statue for themselves, with the added bonus of not having to fork money over to greedy resellers, and I'm all for it.\nAn MSRP of $229.99 / \u00a3219.99 is still going to be out of a lot of Spider-Man fan's budgets, of course. Especially as I'm sure most fans have a copy of the Insomniac Spidey sequel on PS5 (or even Steam) by now, and don't fancy forking out over $200 for another. However, it is the accessibility that I'm a fan of, and I only wish collector's editions for other big PS5 games were still easy to find in 2025.\nNow Sony, can you please restock the Marvel's Spider-Man 2 DualSense controller too? If the 30th anniversary DualSense controller can get a restock, why not Spider-Man?\n- View all PS5 game deals at Amazon\n- Miles Morales Ultimate Edition:\n$69.99$49.28 at Amazon\nPicking up one of the best PS5 controllers, the best PS5 headsets, and one of the best SSDs for PS5 can help make your web-slinging adventures even better on your Sony console.\nEver since I first held a NES controller in my hand I've been obsessed with gaming, and the hardware it runs on. I could hook up a NES and SNES to a telly, without instructions, before I could walk. Even now, nothing is more exciting then taking a console, or handheld, out the box for the first time and setting it up. This obsession transformed into a love of games and game music, which lead to my music degree and dream of becoming the Scottish Nobuo Uematsu.

      "text": "I've played over 100 hours of Marvel Rivals and have never pre-ordered an art book faster\nThe Art of Marvel Rivals launches on September 2\nIt's been a long time since a competitive, online hero shooter has gripped me quite as much as Marvel Rivals, but since it launched at the end of 2024, I've played it at least every week.\nIt being free-to-play is definitely what initially grabbed my attention, but it's the stunning artwork featured throughout the game that's kept me a fan. Now, the official Art of Marvel Rivals book is available to pre-order for $54.99 at Amazon, so I can still browse through my favorite sketches of Cloak and Dagger and Squirrel Girl without even having to boot up the game.\nThe Art of Marvel Rivals | $54.99 at Amazon\nThe Art of Marvel Rivals from Dark Horse Books is a 208-page full-color hardcover, bursting at the seams with all the stunning artwork of the game's heroes, villains, and locations as seen in-game. It's a perfect collector's item for fans of the game, or just for those who want a reference of all the fabulous drawings to help improve their own Marvel art.\nUK: \u00a349.99 at Amazon\nA lot of F2P games tend to have ugly and confusing menus, but navigating through Marval Rivals to see my Cloak and Dagger proficiency edge ever so close to Lord is a more than pleasant experience when I get to gaze upon the full roster of stunning art for the game's now 40 playable characters.\nInstead of just re-using pre-existing art from the comics, Marvel Rivals adapted this stunning sketchy style that's resulted in some of my favorite depictions of the entire universe-worth of characters. As much as I adored reading through Ryan North and Erica Henderson's Unbeatable Squirrel Girl comics back in the day, nothing brings a bigger grin to my face than how Art Director Dino and his team made Doreen look with her anime-like expressions, and vibrant new outfit - and that's before I mention her cute 50s pin-up and punk-rock skins.\nMarvel Rivals Art Director Dino calls this the \"dynamic comic style\" and states in a Art Vision Vol. 01 video on the official game's website that \"creating a compelling style unique to Marvel Rivals, with a strong and distinctive visual representation\" had always been the team's goal, and I can't wait to feast my eyes on a 208-page book full of that visual flair.\nWe don't quite know yet if the upcoming artbook will feature any never-before-seen sketches, but publisher Dark Horse Books states that the hardback is full of development art of the game's characters, including of their \"imitable skills and equipment, and a vast wardrobe of unique costumes\" and concept art \"which can be analyzed in extreme detail\" - I've never pre-ordered an artbook faster in my life.\nWith the artbook set to launch on September 2 later this year, there's a big chance that some of my favorite outfits in the game so far might not be represented. Season three recently kicked off, and the new Power of the Phoenix battle pass features symbiote versions of Squirrel Girl where her fluffy tail has been transformed into a large gaping jaw of terrifying Venom-like proportions - there's even a symbiote Jeff the Land Shark, too. But I guess that's what second volumes are for.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nMore for the Marvel fans...\n- Marvel Rivals: Infinity Graphic Novel: Pre-order for $15.99 at Amazon\n- LEGO Marvel Infinity Gauntlet Set:\n$79.99$62.99 at Amazon - LEGO Marvel Avengers: Endgame Final Battle: $99.95 at Amazon\nCheck out the Marvel Rivals characters and tier list for Season 3 if you want to take your team to victory.\nEver since I first held a NES controller in my hand I've been obsessed with gaming, and the hardware it runs on.

      "text": "The best PS5 headset in 2025\nGetting one of the best PS5 headsets should be a priority for an audio upgrade - here are the top picks at all price points\nBelieve it or not, the PS5 turns five later this year. Sony's current-gen white beast isn't showing its age, but if you want to give your launch, Slim, or even your fancy Pro model a little boost, pairing it with a high-quality headset can go a long way in making your favorite games sound their absolute best and breathing some new life into your Sony console.\nThere's been a slew of premium pairs of cups released in that five-year lifespan, so picking the best PS5 headset can be a bit daunting. Fortunately for you, we've spent all that time testing the latest and greatest PS5 pairs of cups, running them through the biggest releases to work out exactly which devices play nicest with Sony's machine. So far, the best PS5 headset right now is the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless, boasting excellent audio quality and a slick hub / battery system too, but its $300 luxury price isn't for everyone.\nChoosing the right set of cups for you can be tricky - especially if don't want to make compromises with your investment, or if you have a strict budget in mind. We've had our hands on all the best gaming headsets from the best brands, and we continually keep all new releases in our play roster to ensure we're testing against the full market's value. The result below is our list of the absolute best PS5 headsets we've come across so far.\nThe quick list\nBest overall\nThe SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless isn't just the best PS5 headset on the market, it's our favorite gaming headset overall.\nBest budget\nIf you don't want to spend more than $119.99 / \u00a399.99 but don't want to skimp out on features, there are a few options out there, but the Void V2 still packs on the premium quality without a premium price.\nBest for most\nWith its fantastic audio, excellent additional EQ presets, and slick design, the Nova 5 is the best option for most players. You're getting excellent value for money overall.\nBest multiplatform\nWith its HDMI switcher capabilities and out of the box compatibility with Tempest 3D audio, the Astro A50 X is the best option for those splitting their time between consoles. Its overall ease of use will depend on your setup though.\nBest for Tempest 3D\nIf you're after pure Tempest 3D Audio as Sony intended it, the Pulse 3D headset is still one of the best options on the market. It's also surprisingly cheap and comfortable.\nBest mic\nThe BlackShark V3 Pro expands on the quality of its predecessors to produce another outstanding mic for online play.\nThe PS5 is my favorite current-gen pixel pusher and that's only emphasised when its paired with a great gaming headset. I've had hands-on experience with a ton of gaming headsets long before my time as a gaming tech writer, which is why I'm always an advocate for ensuring everyone has one of their own with the best audio quality, a high-end mic, customization options, and that provide the highest echelons in comfort and best PS5 gaming experience. Not everyone has the means to splurge on a pair of cups bursting at the seams with features, which is also why we've ensured there's a PS5 headset as part of their guide, that we've tested ourselves, that'll suit everyone's Sony gaming needs.\nAugust 6 - For this update, I swapped out the Razer BlackShark V2 Pro for the recently released BlackShark V3 Pro in this list. The V2 Pro and its HyperClear Super Wideband microphone are still impressive and one of the best-quality microphones available in modern headsets today. However, the V3 Pro expands on that quality by taking the wideband design and transforming it into a full band mic that produces \"extremely rich, textured vocals\" according to our hardware team's own Tabitha Baker, which is why it's earned a new spot in this guide.\nThe best PS5 headset overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless is more than the best PS5 headset out there, it's our favorite gaming headset overall. This super flexible, incredibly powerful, set of cups hit all the right notes (and then some) during our testing, proving itself a monster on the battlefield with plenty of extra features up its sleeve as well.\n\u2705 You want to invest: The Arctis Nova Pro isn't a cheap headset, but if you're after something that will see you through for years to come it's an excellent investment.\n\u2705 You have a split PC and console setup: You're spending on high quality audio, but also on that split connection hub. That means those running a PC alongside their PS5 will get the best value here.\n\u2705 You don't want to worry about battery: If you're tired of plugging your headset in or running out of juice mid-session, it's well worth putting that problem to bed once and for all. The swappable battery packs are a revelation.\n\u274c You don't want to tinker with EQ settings: There is a little work going into getting the best audio possible out of the Nova Pro Wireless. Anyone looking for an easy plug and play device might want to consider something more streamlined.\n\u274c You have a smaller budget: Of course, if you're after something a little cheaper it's worth chasing another model. We haven't seen sales knock too much off that $349.99 MSRP since launch.\nDesign: Whether you're staring at the original black version or the newer white model (this reviewer's favorite), the Arctis Nova Pro Wireless offers the same slick, sophisticated, understated design. The form factor of cheaper Nova headsets like the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 has been carried through here, but with denser build materials and a more luxurious feel overall. Its design holds up against more recent releases as well. The Razer BlackShark V2 Pro's longer cups and more industrial aesthetic might be better for those after a gaming-esque aesthetic, but I prefer the more laid back vibe of the Nova Pro Wireless. It makes doubling-up as a set of commuting headphones easier and sits more casually in a living room setup.\nFeatures: It's those additional extras like a swappable battery pack and dual connectivity that truly elevate this experience even further. The dedicated base station not only makes for easy connection toggling between PS5 and other devices, but also offers a handy EQ hub so you can get the perfect setting no matter what you're playing.\nMy favorite feature is the hot-swappable battery packs. They theoretically mean you'll never have to hook up your PS5 headset to charge again - one sits in the hub itself on charge while the other powers your device. Once it's drained, simply swap and repeat. With each pack holding 22 hours, you're getting plenty of juice each time as well. In the real world, it just means a quick trip from the couch to your base station once your headset starts to warn you of low power and suddenly you're back up to 100%.\nAudio: We've always enjoyed a SteelSeries soundscape, but the Arctis Nova Pro builds on previous iterations' particularly well. We did find the Arctis 7P to lack a little in the bass, but the new generation brings plenty more power to these lower ranges. Overall sound is incredibly detailed here across the ranges, offering pinpoint precision across audio cues and rich, vivid open world environments.\nVerdict: The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless is the best headset on the market right now, naturally making it the gold standard for PS5 players. It's pricey, but if you're really after top shelf audio this is where we'd recommend you start.\nRead our full SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless review for more.\nComfort | 5/5 |\nAudio | 5/5 |\nBattery | 5/5 |\nMicrophone | 5/5 |\nVersatility | 5/5 |\nBuild quality | 5/5 |\nThe best budget PS5 headset\n2. Corsair Void Wireless V2\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nCorsair's latest budget pair of cups is slightly pricier than the Razer Kaira X headset, which was listed here before. However, at $119.99 / \u00a399.99, the Void Wireless V2 gaming headset is more than worthy of its new best budget PS5 name, as it packs in both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless options, a comfortable fit, a high-quality mic, RGB lighting, and powerful custom 50mm Neodymium drivers for yoru Sony pixel-pushing machine.\n\u2705 You want a powerful sound without a premium price: On some occasions, larger 50mm drivers are reserved for the most costly headsets, but the Void Wireless V2 has got a serious bass boost with its own custom 50mm Neodymium drivers without the costly MSRP.\n\u2705 Comfort is key: At just 303g, the Void V2 is a seriously lightweight headset, which is made all the more comfortable with its cushioned cups and well-padded headband.\n\u274c You need a glasses-friendly fit: While the Void V2 is incredibly lightweight and comfortable, it can be awkward for glasses wearers as its tight clamping force pushes up against your frames. Not to mention, the location of the RGB lighting strips can reflect against your lenses, too.\n\u274c You need a wired connection: Some budget headsets offer a wired connection, but this is purely a wireless headset through and through, with only Bluetooth and 2.4GHz options available for the PS5.\nDesign: The Corsair Void V2 gaming headset\u2019s design is pretty familiar if you\u2019ve already spent time with the Corsair Void Elite. The Void V2 comes with the same diamond-shaped cups, coated in a matt-black plastic finish. Even the yokes are similar, attaching just to the back of each cup to allow for more movement. This time around, however, the RGB-lit up logos of what came before have been replaced with two subtle RGB strips, which can be customized through iCue.\nFeatures: The Void V2 isn't feature-heavy, but it does have pretty much all you'd want from a budget $119.99 / \u00a399.99 wireless gaming headset. The Void V2 is decked out with Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connectivity, and comes with a 2.4GHz dongle that fits easily into one of the PS5's front-facing USB ports (on the launch model). There are onboard controls to find here, though they're pretty minimal, consisting only of a power button, a volume switch, and a remappable button which can be customized through iCue. What makes the minimal features of this affordable headset worth your time is that it manages to pack in some booming custom 50mm audio drivers, and Dolby Atmos support on top, something you can find on Corsair's top-of-the-line headsets, like the Corsair Virtuoso Max. So long as you have the correct Dolby Atmos settings switched on through your PS5, games like Sea of Thieves sound extra immersive, with the creaking of your ship and the crashing of the waves going off all around you.\nAudio: As briefly mentioned already, there's custom 50mm Neodymium audio drivers packed in this budget headset. While playing the latest season (and events) of Marvel RIvals, these helped the cheeky dialogue at the start of every match, Galacta\u2019s high-pitched announcements, or the energetic and empowering score, the low, mids, and high ranges sounded clear as day. Though it was the bass frequencies, which 50 mm-sized drivers are great for, that sounded especially powerful, with even the start-up to Dead by Daylight giving me a scare as it sounded more terrifying and booming than ever. While attached, the flip-to-use omnidirectional mic didn't skimp out on quality either, and made my high-pitched squeals during online Marvel Rival matches sound crystal clear. I'd have preferred a detachable alternative, but you can easily move it out of the way where the mic will become flush with the headset, if you're switching to a single-player game.\nVerdict: Corsair\u2019s Void Wireless V2 is up there with some of the best-sounding headsets out there right now, and is ideal for your PS5 if you want a premium sound without the premium cost. The brand has managed to produce a low-cost headset at $119.99 / \u00a399.99, which still manages to pile on some powerful 50mm Neodymium audio drivers, spatial audio, and a great-sounding mic that I\u2019d expect from their flagship headsets instead.\nComfort | 4/5 |\nAudio | 4/5 |\nBattery | 4/5 |\nMicrophone | 4/5 |\nVersatility | 4/5 |\nBuild quality | 4/5 |\nThe best PS5 headset for most\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5 Wireless is the latest in the Nova line, and it's come a little late compared to the others. That means it can pack even better value than the Nova 4 and Nova 7 it finds itself in between, all while still offering excellent additional features.\n\u2705 You want tailored EQ settings: The Nova 5s are incredibly well geared towards those on the hunt for dedicated EQ settings on console.\n\u2705 Durability is a priority: This is a particularly sturdy piece of kit, despite its lightweight plastic form factor.\n\u2705 You play across a range of platforms: The 5X model is compatible with pretty much anything you can throw at it, including the new Nintendo Switch 2, making it a must-see for anyone running more than just a PS5.\n\u274c You want direct EQ control on PS5: You won't have access to quick EQ band settings through the mobile app, just the desktop software.\n\u274c A high-quality microphone is a priority: The mic in here is great, but it's not as good as the Razer BlackShark V2 Pro or Hyperspeed. If that's your priority, Razer's the better buy.\nDesign: The Nova 5 Wireless sits inline with the rest of the range. This is a ski-band style design with smaller circular cups and a fairly compact footprint overall. That's perfect for hiding away in a corner of your PS5 setup, but the generous padding also makes for long-standing comfort even during the heaviest of sessions. Everything is constructed from a particularly flexible plastic material which makes for a sturdy, durable backbone. We were impressed with this quality in our testing, particularly when travelling.\nFeatures: The biggest feature in here comes in the form of the Nova 5 companion app. This software gives you access to a massive number (100+) of EQ presets created by sound engineers and game developers themselves and tailored specifically for a huge supply of games. That means you're getting the perfect EQ settings for everything from Fall Guys to Fallout, all just a click away on console. That's not something we see every day, where EQ settings like this a generally locked away for PC users.\nElsewhere, there's a good supply of onboard controls (adding a chat mix dial and Bluetooth quick switcher button compared to the Nova 4). You'll also find an extendable mic tucked away in the side. This more subtle design not only means you won't lose a detachable mic, but also makes the Nova 5s a versatile device that can be used for everyday music as well as gaming.\nPerformance: Audio straight out of the box is compelling, but we were surprised by just how well the various EQ presets worked with each game we tested. Yes, some are more useful than others - we're not sure just how much a dedicated Fall Guys option really adds. But there were also some shocks in there - cinematic Baldur's Gate 3 scenes benefitted greatly and - of course - you're getting plenty of competitive options in there as well.\nVerdict: With easy connection options across a massive range of devices, but a specific focus on bringing game-specific EQ settings to consoles like PS5, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5 Wireless makes for a fantastic headset. It's well priced, excellent value for money, and incredibly versatile.\nRead our full SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5 Wireless review for more.\nComfort | 5/5 |\nAudio | 4/5 |\nBattery | 3/5 |\nMicrophone | 5/5 |\nVersatility | 4/5 |\nBuild quality | 5/5 |\nThe best multiplatform PS5 headset\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you primarily play on PS5, but also have an Xbox Series X waiting in the wings, the Astro A50 X is going to be your best friend. The latest release in a long line of fan favorites, the new model features a unique HDMI switcher feature that lets you hop between consoles at just the touch of a button. Meanwhile, the excellent audio and Tempest 3D compatibility mean the overall experience is just as powerful between the cups as well.\n\u2705 You play both PS5 and Xbox: If you've got your PS5 set up next to an Xbox, you're in the optimum position to make the most of the Astro A50 X's feature list.\n\u2705 You only play at home: The base station design means this is limited to the home, but if you don't play on the go that won't feel that sacrifice.\n\u2705 You prioritize spatial audio: The Astro A50 X benefits from compatibility with both Sony's Tempest 3D audio and Xbox's Dolby Atmos options, which means directional sound is particularly well catered for.\n\u274c You split between PS5 and PC in different setups: If you have a PS5 and a PC in different setups, you might want to reconsider. You'll be moving the base station between these setups every time you want to connect, without benefitting from the HDMI switcher features.\n\u274c You need ANC: The Astro A50 X doesn't have any ANC features, which other headsets certainly do at this price point.\nDesign: Astro hasn't thrown out its rulebook here, this is very much the headset line we've all come to recognize. The white model we tested makes the most of those crisp angular lines and larger form factor, and it looks particularly good next to the PS5 to boot. Both the headset and base station are plastic in construction, but both feel sturdy enough to survive some beating. A padded bumper along the top of the headband and plush earcups ensure long lasting comfort, even if those temperatures do start to climb fairly quickly. If you'd prefer, though, you can easily remove the cups themselves from the housing to swap in with a cooler leatherette set. There's a particularly soft swivel to each side which means the cups will sit flush against your head without pinching on the ears, though this looser approach does make slotting the headset onto the charging contacts on the base station a little more fiddly.\nFeatures: The Astro A50 X has an ace in its base station. What was once a charging dock and wireless transmitter is now a bonafide HDMI switcher. That means you'll be hooking up a few HDMI 2.1 cables to the rear to plug both your PS5 and Xbox Series X in at once, then simply flick a switch on the headset to swap both video and audio. PC players can also take advantage of this, but the DisplayPort or USB-A only connection options make things more limited here. Bluetooth is also available, though only through the base station. That means you're covered for Nintendo Switch or gaming handheld play at home, but on the go audio is going to be a little trickier.\nThe A50 X is happiest when it's placed between two consoles, though. The base station keeps the full 4K 120Hz signal of the HDMI 2.1 cables intact, and switches seamlessly between the two provided both are set to rest rather than turned off.\nPerformance: Featuring the same graphene driver tech as the Logitech G Pro X2s released in 2023, the Astro A50 X is an absolute belter. There's a particularly deft handling of competing audio across all the ranges here, as well as a powerful bass and well-spaced higher tones as well. Between the bullet-hell cacophany of Doom Eternal's battlegrounds and the thwacks of an Evil West fist fight, audio was booming where it needed to be and delicate elsewhere. That makes for a particularly well-rounded listening experience, not only in games but across music and movies as well.\nVerdict: While you'll need to have the right setup to make it truly worthwhile, the Astro A50 X is a powerhouse. The HDMI switching functionality makes it the best multiplatform PS5 headset on the market right now. While Bluetooth limitations mean your Nintendo Switch and handheld play is going to be limited to the home, and PC players don't get quite the same treatment as console hoppers, this is still a must-see.\nRead our full Astro A50 X review for more.\nComfort | 4/5 |\nAudio | 5/5 |\nBattery | 5/5 |\nMicrophone | 3/5 |\nVersatility | 3/5 |\nBuild quality | 4/5 |\nThe best PS5 headset for Tempest 3D Audio\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSony's official PS5 headset is, unsurprisingly, a top performer and has consistently been one of our favourites.\n\u2705 You want to make the most of PS5's 3D audio: There aren't many PS5 headsets offering direct compatibility with Sony's Tempest Audio system - and certainly few offering such a feature at this price point.\n\u2705 You want a lightweight headset: The all-plastic construction might put some off, but it's to be expected at this position on the price scale. Plus, it means you're getting a lightweight, particularly comfortable form factor.\n\u2705 You don't play with chat too often: The microphone drawbacks are only going to hurt those who regularly play online with chat. If you stick to solo adventures, there's nothing to worry about.\n\u274c You regularly play online with chat: Of course, if you do take your gameplay online regularly, it's worth investing in a device with a more sophisticated microphone system.\n\u274c You want a longer battery life: At just 12 hours of battery, the Pulse 3D headset isn't a workhorse. If you don't want to worry about plugging in too often, we'd recommend finding something with a boosted battery.\nDesign: Sharing the same design language and aesthetic that the PS5 and its accessories have, the Pulse 3D headset maintains a subtlety in its form - there's no extruding boom mic, and all the tech is discreetly hidden - this is the first major impression we got in testing. A thick rubber ski-style headband keeps the noggin cushioned from the thinner plastic frame, which itself runs down in a curved fashion to two circular cups. It's a novel design that isn't being replicated by many PS5 headsets - save for the colorway of the Razer Kaira line.\nFeatures: Underneath the stylish frame, however, you'll find all the necessary tech to immerse yourself in the PS5's Tempest 3D AudioTech, with the Pulse 3D headset being the best way to get the most from your new console's audio. As we'll see below that 3D tech really is at the forefront of the Pulse's package, which means there are other sacrifices in this spec sheet. There's no retractable mic, and battery life could certainly be better.\nAudio: The headset delivers gloriously rich and detailed sound as you traverse Astro Playroom's noisy noisy platforms, and gives multi-layered audio detail in the roar of combat in Miles Morales. However, it is in the quieter moments that the Pulse 3D headset and the PS5's Tempest audio magic really blew us away: spaceships zoom past your head in Astro, or footsteps' exact direction of travel being discernible in Miles Morales. There's a reason that this is the official headset, and we can see from our testing and hands-on that Sony invested in it.\nVerdict: The results are awesome, and it is absolutely one of the best PS5 headsets - and it's at an aggressive price point too. Sony's official device goes above and beyond the call of duty for its price point, even if there are some microphone sacrifices to get there.\nRead our full PS5 Pulse 3D headset review for more.\nComfort | 4/5 |\nAudio | 3/5 |\nBattery | 1/5 |\nMicrophone | 2/5 |\nVersatility | 3/5 |\nBuild quality | 5/5 |\nThe best microphone on a PS5 headset\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Razer BlackShark V3 Pro and its impressive microphone replaces the V2 Pro as part of this list as it takes the wideband mic of the last-gen model, and offers up a richer, higher-quality experience. This full-band mic isn't the only thing it has going for PS5 players, but this high-end headset is also decked out with ANC, simultaneous Bluetooth and 2.4GHz audio, comfortable ear cups, and a great sound thanks to its Razer TriForce Bio-Cellulose 50mm Gen 2 audio drivers.\n\u2705 You regularly play online with chat: The microphone on the BlackShark V3 Pro is one of the best we've tested yet, making it perfect for playing PS5 games online with friends.\n\u2705 Your PS5 is your console of choice: The previous line was designed with PC players in mind, but the BlackShark V3 Pro has a model available specifically aimed towards those who prefer their PS5 above all else.\n\u2705 You need headphones for commuting: Unlike the V2 Pro, the V3 Pro has ANC on board, so you can take these out and use them as your everyday pair of headphones and escape the noise of the outside world.\n\u274c A wireless connection isn't necessary: Razer has packed a massive battery and a super low latency connection with its HyperSpeed Wireless GEn-2 dongle into the BlackShark V3 Pro, which means you're spending quite a lot on wireless features. If you don't need a cord-free experience, you can save plenty of cash.\n\u274c You'd prefer colorful colorways: Like the rest of the BlackShark line, the V3 Pro is only available in all black or all white models, and so you'll need to look elsewhere if you'd prefer a headset with a bit more pizzazz.\nDesign: If the design and look of the BlackShark V3 Pro is familiar, that's because for this new generation, Razer has stuck with the same aesthetic as the V2 Pro before it. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. This time, however, Razer has changed things up slightly when it comes to the cushioned earcups. The fabric-covered cups now sport a leatherette base that seals sound away and a mesh topper that keeps things sweat-free and comfortable.\nFeatures: Like the V2 Pro before it, which used to take place on this list, the microphone of the V3 Pro is the reason it's earned a spot amongst the rest of the best PS5 headsets in this guide. It's detachable again with this new BlackShark generation of headphones, and remains one of the best in the market, taking the super wideband design of the previous generation and expanding it to a full band 48kHz sampling rate. Our hardware team's own Tabitha Baker noted in her review that the mic produces \"extremely rich, textured vocals\" which makes other headphone mics sound flatter by comparison.\nPerformance: It doesn't just have its mic quality going for it, but the BlackShark V3 Pro also sounds sublime thanks to its Razer TriForce Bio-Cellulose 50mm Gen 2 audio drivers, which bring out the best of the soundtracks to games like Marvel Rivals. In her review, Tabitha also shared that she was, \"immediately enthralled by the amount of space in the low end, but the power that's put into those deeper details is even more impressive\" with this Razer headset. Paired with its ANC, up to 70 hours (PC), up to 48 hours (console) of battery life, and simultaneous Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless audio make it a great follow-up to the iconic BlackShark lineup.\nVerdict: The PS5 version of the Razer BlackShark V3 Pro is designed officially with the Sony console in mind, and brings all the impressive qualities that blew us away with the PC version to console players - especially its rich and fantastic sounding full-band omnidirectional microphone that makes it perfect for online gaming fans.\nRead our full Razer BlackShark V3 Pro review for more.\nThe best PS5 headsets coming soon\nIncoming PS5 headset reviews: This month, I'm testing a wide range of PS5-compatible audio tech, including the Logitech Lightspeed G522 wireless headset and the Razer Clio wireless speaker cushion. Afterwards, I'll also be taking a look at the Skullcandy Crusher PLYR 720 gaming headset, to see what the brand I adored as a teenager can do for the current-gen Sony console.\nHow we test PS5 headsets\nEvery PS5 headset we come across goes through weeks of testing before we make our final review assessment, but we don't just leave these cups on the test bench. These headsets are slotted into our everyday play, becoming our daily drivers for work, play, streaming, and music during their testing period.\nOn PS5, we test across a range of different games, each posing a slightly different question of the device itself. Doom Eternal is used to see how well a driver separates a bassline from more intricate details in the mid-range. Horizon Forbidden West is excellent for measuring a clustered mid-range and how well the headset handles sometimes overpowering environmental sounds when competing with dialogue. Spider-Man: Miles Morales expands upon directional audio in a more condensed environment.\nApex Legends is used to test the directional accuracy of a headset, putting it through its competitive paces for both precision and mic volume. Finally, Dead by Daylight is used to see how the headset deals with a more atmospheric sound, and how it places voice chat within its subtle soundscape.\nOf course, we're also playing whatever game sits on our backlog at the time during testing as well. These titles can differ depending on the access of any given reviewer, but it's always pertinent to test headsets during a whole range of games. Ensuring we're using not just the same games across each headset we test, but also brand-new releases is pertinent to recommending each and every set of cups.\nBeyond pure audio performance, we're also comparing similarly priced headsets based on design and features. We're continually measuring comfort levels across cushion depth, materials, size, shape, and temperatures as well as headband padding, structural shape, and adjustment options. We then look at the extra features on offer in comparison to other spec sheets, noting connection, EQ, control, battery life, microphone type, and noise cancellation.\nOnce reviewed, each PS5 headset is scored out of five across six categories; comfort, audio, battery, microphone, versatility, and build quality.\nFor more information on how we test gaming headsets, check out the full GamesRadar+ Hardware Policy.\nAlso tested\nWe put loads of PS5 headsets to the test and many make great purchases. However, some fall short of others in terms of overall value, features, or quality of life design. We consistently test each headset against new releases to make sure the list above is up to date, dropping previously reviewed models below for further consideration.\nSteelSeries Arctis Nova 3 Wireless | Available at Amazon\nThis $109.99 / \u00a399.99 pair of cups is decked out with a detachable ClearCast Gen 2.X microphone, Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless support, and 40mm Neodymium audio drivers along with some extra impressive features. The headset also sports a new slimline dongle, fast charging, and is available in new Aqua and Lavender colorways, so whether you'd prefer it, or the 5 Wireless, depends on how important the latter is to your PS5 gaming setup.\nNacon RIG 900 Max HS | Available at Nacon\nThe Nacon RIG 900 Max HS is a premium wireless headset designed with the PS5 in mind. At $249.99 / \u00a3209.35 it packs in Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connectivity, a flip-to-use mic, unique design, and app support with a range of EQ audio customization, but its wireless charging stand is where it shines the most. Yet while its charging stand means you rarely, if ever, have to worry about ensuring the 900 Max HS has enough juice, its low-quality mic means it doesn't quite qualify for spot on this list for now.\nNacon RIG 900 MAX HS review\nSennheiser HD 550 gaming headphones | Available from Sennheiser\nThe Sennheiser HD 550 might be aimed with gaming in mind, but they aren't actually a gaming headset, and so they can't qualify for a part on this list. Their $349.99 / \u00a3249.99 price range is similar to options like the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless, but they're lacking any of the same features and just have a wired connection, come with a jack adaptor, and are open-back to produce a more natural sound. They are at least compatible with the PS5 through the 3.5mm port in any DualSense controller, but PS5 players will find limited use of these gaming headphones unless they stick to single-player games.\nCorsair Virtuoso Max Wireless | Available at AmazonThe Corsair Virtuoso Max Wireless headset is a premium set of cups, in both features and cost. At $330/ \u00a3279.99, it's one of the priciest PS5 compatible headsets I've tested so far, but it packs in ANC, Dolby Atmos audio, customizable lighting, a high-quality mic, an included hardbound case, and powerful 50mm Custom Graphene audio drivers so it feels justified. Due to its reliance on iCue and the Dolby Atmos app for sound, and light customization, this headset feels more attuned to PC players than the PS5 - although it still managed to make everything from Marvel Rivals to Dead by Daylight sound sublime on the Sony console.\nCorsair Virtuoso Max Wireless headset review\nOXS Storm G2 wireless headset | Available at Amazon\nThis sub $100 budget wireless gaming headset from OXS comes decked out in a unique, off-white design. But while it's compatible with the PS5 through its accompanying 2.4GHz dongle, Bluetooth is off the cards and doesn't function with Sony's current-gen console, or even the PS4. Taking that, and its sub-par audio quality and cheap-feeling build into consideration, it didn't quite make our list for the best PS5 headsets - but it could be a budget alternative for any younger players in your family.\nOXS Storm G2 wireless headset review\nTurtle Beach Stealth 700 Gen 3 | Available at Amazon\nThe Stealth 700 Gen 3 is the latest addition to the Stealth headset line, introducing high-end 60mm dual eclipse audio drivers to a mid-range pair of cups with a $199.99 / \u00a3179.99 price point. This headset is designed for Xbox consoles, but is still compatible with the PS5 and even comes with an additional 2.4GHz dongle so PS5 and multi-platform players have more options. This headset also has an impressive list of features, from up to 80 hours of battery life to some of the best audio I've heard from any headset. That being said, it's pricier than its mid-range rivals and doesn't match up to the comfort and design set by headsets like the Razer BlackShark V2 Pro which are already part of this list.\nAlienware Pro Wireless headset | Available at Amazon\nThe Alienware Pro Wireless headset is compatible with the PS5 thanks to its Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz connection support. However, this mid-range $229.99 / \u00a3221.99 pair of cups is more suited for PC players. To get the most out of its wider 20Hz - 40kHz frequency range and audio customizability you have to download the Dolby Atmos app, which is only available on PC platforms. If you alternate between your PS5 and PC, the Alienware Pro headset is still a recommended pickup, but as PC players are going to see the biggest benefits, it narrowingly misses a spot amongst the best PS5 headsets.\nAlienware Pro Wireless headset review\nAsus ROG Delta II | Available at Amazon\nThe Asus ROG Delta II headset introduces a lot of modern enhancements to the Delta headline line, most notably the mid-range set of cups can simultaneously connect to consoles via Bluetooth and 2.4Ghz. At $229 / \u00a3219, while an impressive piece of tech, it feels like a weaker package when compared to the best PS5 headsets like Razer's BlackShark V2 Pro or the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5 wireless headset.\nRazer Barracuda X Chroma | Available at Amazon\nThe Razer Barracuda X Chroma (2024) introduces RGB lighting to the Barracuda lineup for the first time and still manages to uphold the sound and build quality that the previous headsets established. The multi-platform excellence providing an easy switch between Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless connections on the PS5 is still on full display, but this flashy add-on comes at a cost of $129.99/\u00a3129.99 making the previous model a more budget-friendly PS5 headset alternative.\nRazer Kaira X | Available at Amazon\nIf you don't want to spend more than $60 / \u00a360, there are a few options out there, but the Razer Kaira X is an ideal pick for the PS5. It is a wired headset, which is one of the reasons why the Corsair Void Wireless V2 replaced it as the best budget headset on this list. However, there's still excellent audio and a slick Sony aesthetic to be found with this Razer device, and it doesn't break the bank either.\nRazer Kaira X review\nTurtle Beach Atlas Air | Available at Amazon\nThe Turtle Beach Atlas Air is the most comfortable headset I've tested yet, but its open back design means it's limited in its application. You'll get sound bleed in both directions here - so if, like many, your PS5 setup is in a shared space it's not going to be the best buy.\nTurtle Beach Stealth 500 | Available at Amazon\nThe Stealth 500 offers solid value for its $79.99 price tag, but with a drop in build quality and battery life compared to the only slightly pricier Stealth 600 Gen 3, it's not doing enough to stand out against the rest of the market.\nTurtle Beach Stealth 600 Gen 3 | Available at Amazon\nThe Turtle Beach Stealth 600 Gen 3 is a fantastic headset overall, competing against the slightly more expensive SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5 Wireless in this list. It offers excellent comfort and battery life with a nicely balanced sound - but doesn't pack the console-focused EQ features of SteelSeries.\nHyperX Cloud 3 Wireless | Available at Amazon\nThe HyperX Cloud 3 Wireless certainly has a few balls in its court - between a comfortable form factor and leading battery life. However, there are too many sacrifices in this build to justify its price tag.\nCorsair HS80 Max | Available at Amazon\nThe Corsair HS80 Max does offer a solid audio proposition for PS5 players, but its price tag punches above its feature set with a lower quality mic and no simultaneous Bluetooth connections.\nRazer BlackShark V2 Hyperspeed | Available at Amazon\nThe BlackShark V2 Hyperspeed is a fantastic gaming headset, coming in cheaper than the Kaira Pro's MSRP while still offering excellent audio and mic quality. However, this is a headset geared towards PC use, with your cash being spent more on THX Spatial Audio than Tempest tech. The USB wired mode puts this further out of PS5 range, especially considering the Kaira Pro also boasts haptic feedback to tap into the DualSense's features more as well.\nCorsair Virtuoso Pro | Available at Amazon\nIf you're after a slick open back gaming headset you've found it, but unfortunately the extra wire faff and background noise means the Corsair Virtuoso Pro isn't ideal for a console setup. This is designed for streamers to plug into a whole host of accessories on PC, so your cash is better placed elsewhere for PS5.\nLogitech G Pro X 2 | Available at Amazon\nAt $250, the Logitech G Pro X 2 is knocking on the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless' door (with sales considered our favorite PS5 headset can often be found for $279). While its graphene drivers and battery life make a fantastic case for it by itself, though, we'd recommend making your cash work a little harder with the superior sound and features of SteelSeries.\nSony Inzone H5 | Available at Amazon\nIf you're buying a headset solely for PS5, we wouldn't recommend the Sony Inzone H5. It may sound like an oversight considering it's coming from the same house as the console, but the H5 straddles its PlayStation and PC markets. That means it doesn't quite nail either use-case, though is perfect for someone who splits their time 50/50.\nAudeze Maxwell | Available at Amazon\nFollowing on from the success of the Penrose and Mobius, the Maxwell kicks things up a notch with boosted battery life, greater sound quality, and a more premium build. That makes its $299.99 / \u00a3319 price point a little easier to swallow - if you're an audiophile after a high end experience you'll be set with these cups.\nSony Inzone H7 | Available at Amazon\nLike the H5 above, the H7 doesn't quite get along with the PS5 in the way you would expect it to. We noted some frustrating PS5 UI issues in our testing, and PC settings don't transfer to your console. Considering this is a $199 MSRP headset, there's much better value for money out there.\nHow to find the right PS5 headset for you\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nIf you don't know where to start in your search for the best PS5 headset, it's worth taking stock of what it is you need from your cups, and how much you're willing to spend. If you're browsing in the sub-$100 / \u00a3100 category, for example, you'll need to make some sacrifices to audio quality to get higher end features (or vice versa). However, those looking to splash some cash on a more premium model will want to make sure they're truly getting their money's worth for the features on offer.\nAfter all, every PS5 headset has a slightly different proposition for you. A Razer Kaira is super easy to use, and provides excellent audio for its price, but it doesn't hold up to some of the more luxurious functions of the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro or even the Razer Kaira Pro.\nThere are a few key features outside of audio quality that you'll need to consider when working out if a PS5 headset will truly fit your setup; connection, software, noise cancellation, and battery life.\nWireless connection\nNowadays this is more than just a yes / no question. The majority of players are on the hunt for a wireless gaming headset for PS5, rather than juggling cables around the DualSense during play. If you're prioritizing your wireless connection, make sure you're getting a 2.4GHz dongle for the fastest connection and you can push the boat out further with an additional Bluetooth option for additional flexibility as well.\nSoftware support\nVery few PS5 headsets offer additional software support, with presets that can be saved directly on the headset via PC and then brought over to console play. That means anyone prioritizing this feature has already narrowed the playing field considerably.\nNoise cancellation\nIf you play in a busier environment, or you want your headset to double up for commutes, you'll want to invest in something with either active noise cancellation (the digital blocking of external sound) or passive noise isolation (the physical blocking of external sound, via a tighter clamp force or larger ear cushions).\nBattery life\nThis is a big one for those who don't want to be worrying about tapping out due to low power or having to plug in before or during a play session. Battery lives generally range from 20 - 50 hours these days, with 70 hour options and hot-swappable battery features available in more premium models.\nBest PS5 headsets: FAQ\nWhat is the best PS5 headset?\nAt the moment, the best PS5 headset is the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless. However, if you're looking to make the most of that Tempest 3D Audio we'd recommend checking out the PlayStation Pulse 3D model instead. For anyone regularly playing online with chat, the Razer BlackShark V2 Pro is your go-to.\nIs any headset compatible with PS5?\nThe great news is that an unbelievable number of headsets are indeed compatible with PS5! In fact, it'd be easier to tell you which ones aren't. However, for clarity, any headset that has a wired 3.5mm jack connection, a wired USB connection, or almost any headset that uses a 2.4GHz dongle will be compatible with a PS5. As a result, this opens up a world of possibilities when looking to get some audio givers for your PS5. What's more, any compatible and connected headset will get you all the benefits of the PS5's Tempest 3D Audio engine.\nCan you use a Bluetooth headset with PS5?\nThe PS5 doesn't pack a Bluetooth connection by itself, which means you'll need to pick up an extra adapter if you want to use a Bluetooth headset or set of earbuds with your console.\nGlossary\n- ANC: Active Noise Cancellation; a digital process of removing external audio picked up by microphones by adding a separate sound to cancel it out.\n- Closed-back: A headset design where the driver is completely enclosed in the body of the cup. This is the norm for gaming headsets.\n- Driver: The part of a gaming headset that produces the audio by converting electrical signals into sound waves.\n- Dynamic: A driver type; dynamic drivers are the most commonly used in gaming headsets due to their low cost and wide range.\n- EQ: Equalizer; a feature usually found in a gaming headset's software that allows for the fine-tuning of each frequency point along the device's audio range. EQ settings are used to emphasize or de-emphasize certain sounds like basslines or treble.\n- Frequency response: The range of frequencies a gaming headset can produce, usually sitting at 20Hz - 20kHz, the range of human hearing.\n- Graphene: A lightweight but sturdy material used in the drivers of high-end headsets to reduce distortion.\n- Latency: The speed at which a wireless headset can receive information from your PS5, a higher latency will result in missed audio cues and is inadvisable for competitive play.\n- Open-back: A headset design where the driver is not enclosed within the main body of the headset, offering a more spacious and natural soundstage while also bringing sound bleed in both directions.\n- Planar: An alternative, more expensive, driver design that prioritizes clarity in low-end frequencies and reduces distortion while also proving more responsive in-game.\n- Tempest 3D Audio: Sony's audio engine that uses object tracking to create realistic directional audio.\nIf you're not exactly in the PlayStation camp, we're also rounding up all the best Xbox Series X headsets and the best Nintendo Switch headsets on the market right now.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nEver since I first held a NES controller in my hand I've been obsessed with gaming, and the hardware it runs on. I could hook up a NES and SNES to a telly, without instructions, before I could walk. Even now, nothing is more exciting then taking a console, or handheld, out the box for the first time and setting it up. This obsession transformed into a love of games and game music, which lead to my music degree and dream of becoming the Scottish Nobuo Uematsu. After sharing my love of games through music, I began to share my love through words on sites like TechRadar and iMore. This lead to becoming a Hardware staff writer for PCGamesN, and later the Senior Tech Writer for Dexerto, covering all things Steam Deck, PlayStation and Nintendo. With that experience, I was able to level up as Hardware Editor for GamesRadar+, where I'm still just as Nintendo, PlayStation and gaming tech obsessed as ever.\n- Rob Dwiar\n- Joe DonnellyContributor\n- Tabitha BakerManaging Editor - Hardware"

      "text": "Best gaming headset 2025 - the cream of the audio crop\nThe greatest audio experiences out there\nSo, you\u2019ve just got yourself a flashy new PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2 handheld, or upgraded your precious gaming PC? Well, it\u2019s probably time to pair your new high-powered pixel-pusher with one of the best gaming headsets. Think about it - what\u2019s the point of forking out all that cash if you can\u2019t accurately hear bullets whizzing by, character dialogue, the nuances of modern game soundtracks, or chat with your friends when playing online games?\nDuring my many years as a hardware writer, and even before, I\u2019ve had a plethora of gaming headsets on my head and ears, so I\u2019ve learned a thing or two about what separates the best from the rest. The best gaming headset for you will still ultimately depend on your budget and what high-end features you need above all else. This is why I\u2019ve gathered a myriad of headsets to suit a variety of price ranges that still don\u2019t skip out on providing the best in audio, mic quality, and comfort.\nOverall, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless reigns supreme over other headsets that myself, and the rest of the hardware team have tested, thanks to its existence as a multi-platform battery-saving superstar with fantastic sound and comfort. However, there's no shortage of high-powered and more budget-friendly alternatives out there, and we\u2019ve all of them through their paces - and you can see the results for yourself below.\nThe quick list\nBest overall\nThe SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless packs a serious audio punch while also offering a whole roster of unique extra features.\nBest for most\nThe SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3 Wireless is a budget-friendly, cozy-gamer dream thanks to its cute color combinations, Bluetooth and 2.4GHz support, impressive sound, and detachable mic, all for just over the $100 price mark.\nBest cheap\nSteelSeries dominates in the budget category as well, with its wired Nova 1 offering incredibly value at for a sub $60 / \u00a360 price point.\nBest multiplatform\nThe Astro A50 X is a luxury piece of kit for those running their PC setups alongside different consoles. KVM HDMI switching, a charging base station, and fantastic audio make this a must-see.\nBest for PC\nThe PC version of the new BlackShark V3 Pro is our top pick for Windows users due to its excellent audio and phenomenal mic.\nBest for consoles\nThe Nova 5X Wireless does something very few console headsets can - it incorporates high-end EQ presets into faff-free play.\nLoad the next 3 products \u2193\nBest for Switch\nThe Razer Barracuda X is a fantastic wireless headset for Nintendo Switch that manages to come in well under $100 / \u00a3100 day to day. It's a true plug-and play wizard excellent for handheld play.\nBest open back\nThe Turtle Beach Atlas Air is the most comfortable headset we've tested yet, so if you're on the hunt for an open back device this is where you should be looking.\nBest for battery\nThat 300 hour battery life simply can't be beaten, and HyperX backs it up with a pretty spectacular audio quality as well. This is one for those who hate charging.\nGaming headsets have been glued to my head even longer than I've been reviewing them during my time as a gaming tech writer. That's why having a headset with great audio quality, a high-end mic, customization options, and that provide the highest echelons in comfort is of utmost importance to me. Before writing about gaming audio tech, I spent years training as a professional musician, which included getting hands-on experience with studio-grade tech. This music degree, combined with my time spent reviewing headsets has since only emphasized my insistence on ensuring everyone has the best gaming audio experience possible, no matter the budget.\nAugust 8 - For this update, I swapped out the BlackShark V2 Pro for the new BlackShark V3 Pro as the 'best PC headset' on this list. The V2 Pro is still an impressive pair of cups, and a fantastic option for PC players looking for a high-quality headset, but the new V3 Pro takes things a step further from its predecessor. This new headset has the same lightweight and comfortable form factor, but instead boosts its audio thanks to its 50mm Razer TriForce Bio-Cellulose 50mm Gen 2 audio drivers, and introduces even more vocal clarity on PC due to its new Razer TriForce Bio-Cellulose 50 mm Drivers Gen-2 microphone.\nThe best gaming headset overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIt's been a couple of years now, but the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless still reigns supreme. This is a feature-rich headset that sings, and continues to prove its worth over newer releases from other brands on a daily basis. Not only that, but discounts are starting to appear more frequently now, which means you might be able to catch it much closer to $279 / \u00a3279 if you're shopping at the right time.\n\u2705 You're investing long term: This isn't a cheap headset, but it will go the distance if you're looking to spend big now and reap the rewards for years to come.\n\u2705 You play across PC and consoles: That dual-connection hub makes the most sense for those splitting their time between PC and console within the same setup.\n\u2705 You don't like plugging in: The hot-swappable battery packs in the cup were revolutionary when we first tested them. Simply slot one battery in to charge and slap another in your headset and you'll never have to juice up again.\n\u274c You only play on one system: If you're not splitting your setup, the amount you're paying for those dual-connectivity and easy switching features doesn't make sense. We'd recommend checking out some of the more platform-specific options on this list if you fly solo.\n\u274c You don't want to fiddle with EQ: There is a little work going into getting the best audio possible out of the Nova Pro Wireless. Anyone looking for an easy plug and play device might want to consider something more streamlined.\nDesign: The Nova Pro Wireless looks fairly similar to the rest of SteelSeries' latest line, with its smaller 40mm cups, ski-band frame, and deep cushions. We're big fans of this design, though, so with the Pro's extra touch of luxury these cups absolutely shine. The aesthetic is just subtle enough to pass as a normal set of headphones when commuting, while also hiding its own gaming secrets (like the extendable mic neatly tucked into the side). 2024 also saw the first alternate colorway, with a white model hitting the shelves in the spring.\nFeatures: We'll get first to what we found to be the most helpful extra feature in our testing; hot-swappable batteries. You get two out of the box, with each battery carrying 22 hours of charge by itself (more than the Turtle Beach Stealth Pro's implementation at 12 hours) and charged inside the included hub. When one burns out, simply remove it from the cup of the headset and swap it for the charged alternative.\nThe hub itself is more than just a connection to your consoles and PC, it's a full EQ system with its own display, control dial, and menu. That's perfect for on-the-fly fine tuning, with easy access for switching between devices. It's not quite as sophisticated as the KVM switching functionality of the Astro A50 X below, but it's certainly still ahead of most competitors.\nAs of the SteelSeries GG 89.1.0 update, the Arctis Nova Pro Wireless is also fully compatible with the Nintendo Switch 2, making it even more of a multi-platform headset force to be reckoned with.\nAudio: SteelSeries has always excelled in its audio, prioritizing natural tones with excellent clarity and definition. While the previous Arctis line could sometimes drop the lower ranges a little, the Nova Pros feel incredibly robust across the full soundstage.\nThere's power here, for sure, but those bassier tones also still manage to carry a crispness that crunches through with particular detail. That's incredibly difficult to pull off, but makes all the difference on the battlefield.\nThe Verdict: The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless can do it all, in a way very few gaming headsets can seek to replicate. This is a fantastic piece of kit well deserving of the top spot.\nRead our full SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless review for more.\nComfort | 4/5 |\nAudio | 5/5 |\nBattery | 5/5 |\nMicrophone | 5/5 |\nVersatility | 5/5 |\nBuild quality | 5/5 |\nThe best gaming headset for most people\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3 Wireless is the brand's latest pair of budget cups, ready to replace the Arctis Nova 1 for those who'd prefer not to be at the mercy of wires while they play the PC, PS5, Nintendo Switch and new Switch 2, and the Xbox Series X/S if you have the Arctis Nvoa 3X model. At just $109.99 / $99.99 it's slightly more affordable than its Arctis Nova 5 Wireless brethern, but it manages to pile on more quality of life features, from cuter Lavender and Aqua colorways to suit more gaming setups, a detachable ClearCast Gen 2.X microphone, a new slimline 2.4GHz wireless dongle, and fast charging too.\n\u2705 You need the reassurance of a detachable mic: If you can't put your trust in a headset with a retractable mic, you can pop the boom of the Arctis Nova 3 Wireless off and be reassured that strangers won't hear your online game chatter.\n\u2705 You want lots of audio presets to play with: The Arctis Nova 3 Wireless is compatible with the SteelSeries Arctis app, giving you hundreds upon hundreds of official game audio presets at your fingertips.\n\u2705 You want complete Switch 2 support: Thanks to a new update, both Bluetooth and its 2.4GHz wireless connectivity and fully compatible with the Switch 2.\n\u274c You want a more Pro sound: The 40mm Neodymium drivers are the same as found in previous SteelSeries headsets and can give justice to all your favorite games. But if you're after a more powerful sound, sticking with the brand's Pro Wireless premium alternative is your best bet.\nDesign: The Arctis Nova 3 Wireless is very similar to the Arctis Nova 5 Wireless when it comes to design, but with some minor changes. For one, all of the onboard controls have had a little mix-up. The mic mute button and volume/chat mix dial are still on the bottom edge of the left cup, however, now so are all the buttons you need to get this headset up and rolling. Instead of relinquishing the power button to the right cup, it\u2019s now confined under the dial, and when pressing a series of different combinations, it also finds itself as the pairing and quick switch button too.\nThe most striking design difference is obviously down to its bright colorway, as the headset is available in not just black and white SKUS, but also in Lavender and Aqua to suit more colorful gaming setups.\nFeatures: The Arctis Nova 3 Wireless doesn't provide many brand-new features as opposed to the rest of the SteelSeries lineup of headsets. Compatibility with a range of consoles, from the PS5, Xbox Series X/S (only with the 3X Wireless model), Steam Deck, PC platforms, and the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 is on show here, as is the support with the free-to-download Arctis app. Where the 3 Wireless differs is down to its fast charging support, which can give the headset up to 9 hours of juice after just 15 minutes' worth of charging.\nAudio: The Arctis Nova 3 Wireless is decked out with the same impressive 40mm audio drivers as other headsets in this list, most notably the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5 Wireless. With that in mind, it can conjure up the same high-quality audio, which, through my testing, let me hear every single green and red shell hurling towards me in Mario Kart World on the Nintendo Switch 2, and even the pitter patter of every footstep as players tried to flank down my team in matches of Marvel Rivals on the PS5.\nVerdict: The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3 essentially feels like a re-packaged Arctis Nova 5 Wireless but with a range of more interesting colorways to suit different gaming setup types, a detachable microphone, speedier fast-charging, and a slimmer 2.4GHz wireless dongle. If you're after a low-cost headset that's compatible with a wide range of devices but doesn't skimp out on some of the features and impressive audio quality typically found on mid-range alternatives, the Arctis Nova 3 Wireless is an ideal all-rounder no matter your platform of choice.\nComfort | 5/5 |\nAudio | 4/5 |\nBattery | 4/5 |\nMicrophone | 4/5 |\nVersatility | 5/5 |\nBuild quality | 5/5 |\nThe best cheap gaming headset\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1 is now the best cheap gaming headset on the market, after our previous contender didn't quite hold up to the newer release in testing re-runs. It's been five years since the Corsair HS35 first impressed us, but the 2022 SteelSeries release is better in every way.\n\u2705 You don't need a wireless connection: Budget headsets keep their prices low by keeping that cable tethered, and the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1 is no different.\n\u2705 You switch between solo and online play: The retractable microphone is an excellent feature this far down the price scale, and means your comms are always just a second away without getting in your face during single-player adventures.\n\u274c You play competitively: With stereo sound limiting your directional cues, we'd recommend avoiding if you're going to be relying on 360 sound for competitive or immersive benefits.\n\u274c You don't get on with a ski-band design: The Arctis Nova 1 shares the ski-style headband of its more premium contemporaries, but not everyone finds this style comfortable. For the most part, it alleviates pressure around the crown, but if you prefer more padding instead it's worth checking out the Corsair HS35 still.\nDesign: Your eyes don't deceive you, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1 bares a striking resemblance to its much more expensive Pro sibling sitting at the top of our list. While the actual materials used mean this does feel like a cheaper headset in the hands, you're still getting the solid frame, elastic headband, and smaller circular cups that have come to define the Nova range. You're also getting that retractable microphone - a gift on the Nova Pros and still just as handy here. Rather than worrying about unplugging the mic (and eventually losing it) like most budget headsets, you can simply slide it back into the housing when not required. That's a design element far more commonly seen on high-end devices.\nFeatures: It should be obvious looking at the price difference that the Nova 1s offer a far more restricted feature set than the Pros or Nova 5s listed further down this page. However, they still beat the market across frequency range (moving further into the highs than the Corsair HS35), microphone, surround sound, and adjustability. Onboard controls are limited to a volume wheel and chat mute (as is generally to be expected in the budget category), and there's no chat mix dial on the headset itself.\nSteelSeries has, however, granted its cheaper headset an extra edge in the competitive world. While it's not going to see you through more cutthroat scenarios, the brand's software support can enhance your directional audio and allow for EQ tweaks as well.\nAudio: For their high-end design and simple but effective feature set, it's the audio performance of the Nova 1s that really make them shine. In our testing, the difference between this $50 / \u00a350 headset and the Arctis Nova 7 was remarkably subtle. Everything is particularly clear and well-rounded, with nice balancing around the mids and lower ranges (which can often be artificially boosted in cheap gaming headsets). No, they're not going to give more premium headsets anything to sweat about - this is still an entry level offering - but the developments SteelSeries has made in this budget category are impressive.\nThe Verdict: The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1 does exactly what you want it to do for $50 / \u00a350. It plugs directly into anything you want it to and fires game audio into your ears well. SteelSeries has added features and an audio quality that you won't normally find at this budget price point, though, making their entry level device the best on the market. for more.\nRead our full SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1 review for more.\nComfort | 4/5 |\nAudio | 3/5 |\nBattery | N/A |\nMicrophone | 3/5 |\nVersatility | 4/5 |\nBuild quality | 4/5 |\nThe best multiplatform gaming headset\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAfter a brief hiatus from new releases, Logitech and Astro brought the A50 X to market right at the end of 2023. While it's still a little difficult to get hold of, the unique HDMI switcher design makes it an incredible multiplatform gaming headset - especially if you're running both a PS5 and Xbox in the same setup.\n\u2705 You have all your devices in one setup: The A50 X has been designed to work in a setup with PS5, Xbox and PC all sitting pretty together. If that's how you play this is a massive upgrade.\n\u2705 You want to invest in extra features: That HDMI switcher is adding some cash to the final price tag, but it's a lifesaver for those regularly hopping between consoles.\n\u274c You regularly travel with handhelds: If you're after an all-in-one headset for on the go use as well as home play, this isn't it. The headset itself doesn't have Bluetooth functionality so you'll be investing in an extra alternative if you want to take things on the road.\n\u274c Noise canceling is a priority: Unlike the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless, the Astro A50 X doesn't have active noise cancellation. At this price you can easily factor such a feature into your budget with alternatives, though.\nDesign: This is the Astro we all know and love and very little has changed from a design perspective. You've still got those clean angular lines and large cylindrical headband sliders, as well as that classic geometric base station. The Astro A50 X is available in either black or white, but the white version we tested offers a particularly crisp aesthetic, without picking up smudges or dirt.\nThis is mostly a plastic construction but everything feels solid in the hand. Each cup rotates to sit flat on a surface, which makes for excellent positioning on the head and, combined with well-padded, though slightly warm, cushions, you've got long lasting comfort as well. The soft material pads can be magnetically removed from the main headset and swapped out for cooler leatherette options as well.\nFeatures: The Astro A50 X offers one feature that no other gaming headsets on the market can - an HDMI switcher baked right into the base station. You'll be matching up a serious number of HDMI 2.1 cables, but once everything is plugged into the back, a simple tap on a headset button swaps both your audio and video between PlayStation and Xbox. Not only that, but your full 4K 120Hz signal is kept intact to boot. That's a seriously handy way of navigating the old difficulties between PlayStation and Xbox wireless compatibility - even if it does leave PC in the dark a little with its USB-A or DisplayPort limitations.\nElsewhere, you've got all the controls you'll need on each side of the headset, including a chat mix rocker than spreads across the whole right side. Logitech's Lightspeed connection makes for a super reliable experience and widespread coverage, and spatial audio on PC and Xbox, with Dolby Atmos included, is nice to have as well.\nPerformance: Those graphene drivers are pulling some serious weight here, this is fantastic audio quality. With a particularly clean sound across all ranges, but most notably in lower bassy tones, and excellent balancing between heavier effects and lighter soundtracks and dialogue, the Astro A50 X boasts phenomenal sound quality. Not only that, but there's a super clear microphone topping it all off.\nVerdict: The Astro A50 X isn't going to be for everyone, but if it wasn't for the practicality issues in a split setup (say with consoles in one room and a PC in another) or the Bluetooth being limited to the base station only it would be knocking on SteelSeries' door for the top spot. Incredibly well detailed audio, unique additional features, and a slick, comfortable form factor make this a must-see. for more.\nRead our full Astro A50 X review for more.\nComfort | 4/5 |\nAudio | 5/5 |\nBattery | 5/5 |\nMicrophone | 3/5 |\nVersatility | 3/5 |\nBuild quality | 4/5 |\nThe best gaming headset for PC\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThis space in the guide used to be set aside for the Razer BlackShark V2 Pro, but now the next generation of Razer BlackShark headsets has taken its best PC headset crown. The V2 Pro is still an impressive headset, and with the BlackShark V3 Pro now out in the wild, it's very likely to get cheaper over time, making it a great option for PC players on a budget. However, the V3 Pro sounds even more incredible than its V2 predecessor, and its combined wealth of features, from its up to 70 hours battery life, Windows-specific THX Spatial support, and rich-sounding Detachable Razer HyperClear Full Band 12 mm microphone, has earned its rightful place in this list.\n\u2705 You regularly play online with chat: The microphone on the BlackShark V3 Pro is one of the best we've tested yet, making it perfect for playing PS5 games online with friends.\n\u2705 You loved the comfort of the V2 Pro: The V3 Pro carries the same form factor as what came before, so if you valued the lightweight and well-cushioned nature of the V2 Pro, then you'll have an equally comfortable time with this headset.\n\u274c You'd prefer colorful colorways: Like the rest of the BlackShark line, the V3 Pro is only available in all black or all white models, and so you'll need to look elsewhere if you'd prefer a headset with a bit more pizzazz.\nDesign: If the design and look of the BlackShark V3 Pro is familiar, that's because Razer has stuck with the same aesthetic as the V2 Pro before it. There are some small differences, as Razer has changed things up slightly when it comes to the cushioned earcups. The fabric-covered cups now sport a leatherette base that seals sound away and a mesh topper that keeps things sweat-free and comfortable. The PC version of the V3 Pro is available in all black and all white colorways, but you do get a spot of color with some blue Sony stitching if you gran the PS5 model instead.\nFeatures: Like the V2 Pro before it, which used to take place on this list, the microphone of the V3 Pro is one of the main reasons why it's one of the best PC headsets on the market today. It's detachable again with this new BlackShark generation of headphones, and has been expanded to a full band mic with a 48kHz sampling rate. Our hardware team's own Tabitha Baker noted in her review that the mic produces \"extremely rich, textured vocals\" which makes other headphone mics sound flatter by comparison. The V3 Pro is also equipped with ANC, up to 70 hours of battery life on PC, EQ customization, and simultaneous Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless audio.\nPerformance: It doesn't just have its mic quality going for it, but the BlackShark V3 Pro also sounds sublime thanks to its Razer TriForce Bio-Cellulose 50mm Gen 2 audio drivers, which bring out the best of the soundtracks to games like Marvel Rivals. In her review, Tabitha also shared that she was, \"immediately enthralled by the amount of space in the low end, but the power that's put into those deeper details is even more impressive\" with this Razer headset. Paired with its previously mentioned features, like ANC, up to 70 hours (PC), up to 48 hours (console) of battery life, and simultaneous Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless audio make it a great follow-up to the iconic BlackShark lineup.\nVerdict: The Razer BlackShark V3 Pro is a fantastic follow-up to the V2 Pro, and has some of the best-sounding audio out of any headset available to purchase right now. If you're after a feature-filled headset for PC gaming, you don't need to look further than Razer's latest pair of cups.\nRead our full Razer BlackShark V3 Pro review for more.\nThe best gaming headset for consoles\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5 Wireless offers something slightly different for PS5 and Xbox users from previous headsets in the Arctis Nova lineup. Aside from being a fantastic set of cups in its own right, the companion app allows for a massive range of pre-developed audio presets tuned by developers, eSports competitors, and sound engineers. That's a new dawn for EQ tweaking on console, making it our favorite gaming headset for PlayStation and Xbox fans.\n\u2705 You want audio tailored to your games: There are a few headsets that offer EQ presets via a companion app on console, but the Nova 5 Wireless is the only one to pack this number of high quality profiles in one place.\n\u2705 You need durability: Headsets can take a beating, especially if you're taking it on the road with you. The Nova 5 Wireless is particularly well put together, and nicely flexible in its design, which gives us every confidence in its long term durability.\n\u274c You want more fine-tuned EQ options: The companion app is great, but it doesn't allow you to fine-tune your settings with full sliders. This is still achievable when connecting to SteelSeries' software on PC, but it's not quite as easy as using the presets.\n\u274c Mic quality is a priority: The mic in here is solid but it's not as strong as the BlackShark V2 Hyperspeed listed above, which comes in at the exact same MSRP.\nDesign: The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5 Wireless speaks the same design language as the rest of the range. These are smaller, circular cups but they still hug the ear nicely with plush cushioning preventing any kind of pinching. This was particularly well received in our testing, creating a solid seal but with comfort lasting all the way through longer sessions.\nThat's supported by a ski-band running under the main plastic headband at the top, adjustable via both a slider and toggles. The entire device is made from a high-quality, malleable plastic. That means no creaks when manipulating the headband, even to extreme levels, and there are no points of weakness that gave us any concerns during testing.\nFeatures: Of course, the official Nova 5 companion app is a major benefit. It packs pre-made audio profiles tailored to everything from Fall Guys to CS:GO, Fallout to Apex Legends. Pairing between the headset and your iPhone (or Android) is quick and easy, we never had any frustrating re-pairing issues during testing. You can set different profiles for a Bluetooth or 2.4GHz connection and also control certain microphone settings in here as well.\nAside from that, the Nova 5 Wireless also features more onboard controls than the Nova 4 before it, with a chat mix dial and Bluetooth quick switcher button bundled in with your standard volume, mic mute, and power options. The excellent extendable microphone is also present, tucking neatly away into the headset when not in use. Noe that there's no wired connection available here so you're fully reliant on those cordless options.\nPerformance: Straight out of the box you're still getting that fantastic SteelSeries audio quality, with excellent balancing and particularly strong detail in the lower ranges (at the expense of raw power in certain situations). However, the quality of those individual presets surprised us during testing. It's easy to make a profile for competitive FPS titles these days, but allowing certain environmental sounds and echoes to shine in Baldur's Gate 3 or giving special attention to item sounds and engines in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a slightly more difficult task. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5 Wireless attacks a massive number of games with their own dedicated audio profile - and some are more useful than others - but generally does so with fantastic results.\nVerdict: The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5 Wireless sits at the lower end of the mid-range price tag, but still packs incredible performance, unique features for console users, and a longstanding commitment to comfort and durability. We'd recommend picking up the 5X model for the best compatibility with both PS5 and Xbox Series X. for more.\nRead our full SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5 Wireless review for more.\nComfort | 5/5 |\nAudio | 4/5 |\nBattery | 3/5 |\nMicrophone | 5/5 |\nVersatility | 4/5 |\nBuild quality | 5/5 |\nThe best gaming headset for Nintendo Switch\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAt $99.99 / \u00a399.99, the Razer Barracuda X is a rare beast; a wireless headset with an excellent sound quality and plenty of extra features for under $100. Anyone on the hunt for a cost effective set of cups for their cheaper console will be well served here. However, the simple plug and play system will see PC and PlayStation players through as well.\n\u2705 You play in handheld mode on the go: This is where the Razer Barracuda X is most at home. With its comfort, ease of wireless connection, and excellent battery life, it's the perfect headset to take on the road.\n\u2705 EQ settings don't interest you: If you don't want all the faff of setting up the perfect equalizer balance, the plug and play nature of the Barracuda X is perfect. Of course, you can still quickly tweak in the mobile app - but there's no intimidating dials and levels to concern yourself with here.\n\u274c Software support is important: If you do want to tinker with your audio balance, the Razer Audio app is restricted compared to Synapse. The Barracuda X doesn't support Synapse 3, so you are stuck with a watered down set of controls.\n\u274c You want to fall back on a wired connection: The wired connection isn't powered, so we noticed a significant drop in quality when bringing a cable in to play.\nDesign: The Barracuda X is contained in a subtle form factor. The oval shaped cups and relatively unbranded aesthetic means this could easily pass for your everyday set of headphones. That's excellent news for anyone after a gaming headset to double up for their commute.\nWe also found the plush cushioning and longer cup shape to be particularly comfortable - even over long sessions. A breathable mesh fabric keeps things cool on the top, while the metal running along the headband ensures even the swivel hinges feel secure and durable. That all combines to create just the right level of clamp - enough to block out external noise while still leaving plenty of room to breathe.\nFeatures: The latest 2022 Razer Barracuda X improves on the previous 2021 generation in a number of ways. Perhaps the largest draw is the new low-latency Bluetooth connection, allowing for use across a massive range of mobile devices. That, and the fact that it retains its impressive sound quality, long-lasting comfort, and adds an excellent 80 hour battery life, makes it the best gaming headset for Nintendo Switch.\nYou don't have to rely on the 2.4GHz dongle if you're out and about, and you'll also be able to switch between your phone and console if commuting. That's perfect for the casual Switcher - but the price tag makes things all the more compelling. Razer suggests a 50 hour battery life, and we found that the 2022 Barracuda X not only met these estimates but exceeded them. Of course, this is straight out of the box and with battery degradation that juice is going to start running out faster.\nAudio: We found that excellent sound quality of the original model was retained across all platforms. There's an impressive amount of power behind these 40mm drivers, offering a well-balanced sound across everything from Doom Eternal to The Last of Us Part 2. The twinkly melodies of Super Mario Galaxy were given particularly strong attention, with detailing across larger, booming sounds matching those of smaller sound effects well.\nYou'll find a passable virtual 7.1 surround sound on PC (available only by a separate program, the Barracuda X isn't compatible with Synapse 3 software), offering a basic sense of direction. It's not going to compete with that of the Corsair Virtuoso or Audeze Maxwell, but it's there if you do fancy tinkering on a keyboard. Nintendo Switch players, though, are always going to be limited by the system's stereo sound, which makes the lack of extra tuning features less impactful. Plus, you've always got EQ customization options on the Razer Audio app.\nVerdict: You're getting incredible value for money with the Razer Barracuda X. Its plush, breathable materials, long battery life, excellent performance for the money, and flexible wireless connections make it the best Nintendo Switch headset for the majority of users. Most Switch players really don't need all the fancy features of the high-end devices above, and the Barracuda X concentrates its strengths exactly where these players need them to be.\nRead our full Razer Barracuda X (2022) review for more.\nComfort | 4/5 |\nAudio | 4/5 |\nBattery | 3/5 |\nMicrophone | 3/5 |\nVersatility | 5/5 |\nBuild quality | 4/5 |\nThe best open back gaming headset\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Turtle Beach Atlas Air does things a little differently. Not only is it the brand's first open back gaming headset, but it's one of the first of this kind we've seen with a 2.4GHz and Bluetooth wireless connection. That's some serious power, and the fact that it still sounds great, doesn't top the price charts and is the most comfortable headset on the market right now makes it a top pick.\n\u2705 You have your own gaming space: This is one for those with their own gaming space as the open back design will leak sound in both directions.\n\u2705 You play for long periods of time: A mesh headband, floating earcups, and lightweight form factor make this the pinnacle of headset comfort right now.\n\u2705 A wireless connection is a priority: It's rare to find an open back headset with a wireless connection - but Turtle Beach managed to stuff two into this thing.\n\u274c You're a streamer: An open back headset is perfect for streamers as they can hear themselves speaking much more naturally. Unfortunately, the Atlas Air's microphone can't quite compete with the Corsair Virtuoso Pro's.\n\u274c You prioritize audio quality over ease of use features: If you're going all out on sound quality, you'd be better off with the Corsair Virtuoso Pro as it has marginally improved sound. You are sacrificing a lot of other features to get there though.\nDesign: The Atlas Air blew us away in testing - this thing is seriously comfortable. A mesh headband combined with floating earcups and a relatively lightweight footprint made for an incredible impressive experience. There's absolutely no headband pinch (you can barely feel that it's there at all) and the lower clamp force has the cups gently resting against the ears.\nIt's a shame that lighter (and therefore cheaper-feeling) plastics have to be used to achieve this effect, as the Atlas Air doesn't look like the premium headset it is. That said, you can't go too far wrong with a subtle matte black aesthetic.\nFeatures: There are very few open back gaming headsets with wireless connections, but the Atlas Air manages to squeeze both 2.4GHz and Bluetooth compatibility in this 301g headsets - and do so with a strong 50 hour battery life. That means it's far more versatile than the wired-only Corsair Virtuoso Pro (our previous top pick for the best open back gaming headset), running across everything from PC to Nintendo Switch.\nYou'll find a nice array of controls on the left cup with a Bluetooth quick-switcher button in pride of place. However, the volume knob is noticeably absent on first look. Turning the headset around, you'll find that the circular panel on this cup functions as a full volume control wheel. That's excellent for speedy tweaks without having to fumble for the right spot.\nA detachable microphone is also available in the box - but even this little mic changes things up. It's completely removable for when you don't want it hovering in front of you, but once plugged in it becomes a full flip-to-mute number. That's not something we've seen before, but it's an incredibly flexible design that gives you the best of both worlds.\nAudio: The Turtle Beach Atlas Air sounds fantastic. That open back design means soundstages are open, natural, and incredibly well-detailed. Lower ranges are free to hum away while highs and mids have plenty of space to draw out more intricate melodies, environmental effects, or dialogue tones. Plus, with that extra space in the soundstage, it's still easy to pinpoint enemies and movements in more competitive endeavours.\nWe previously had the Corsair Virtuoso Pro in pride of place here, due to its incredible audio quality and graphene drivers. In side-by-side testing, the Virtuso Pro did have a little extra to give, particularly when it came to the higher ranges however we were still more than impressed with the Atlas Air.\nVerdict: The Atlas Air goes where no headset has really gone before - offering something new in a sea of $150 - $200 devices that struggle to differentiate themselves. A wireless open back headset with power and detail in equal measure and the most comfortable design we've ever experienced - this is one for the books.\nRead our full Turtle Beach Atlas Air review for more.\nComfort | 5/5 |\nAudio | 4/5 |\nBattery | 3/5 |\nMicrophone | 3/5 |\nVersatility | 5/5 |\nBuild quality | 3/5 |\nThe best gaming headset for battery\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you're after a workhorse of a single player experience, the HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless is the best gaming headset going in terms of battery life. That's because there's a massive 300 hour power pack inside these cups - offering three times the battery life of our previous top pick for juice, the EPOS Sennheiser GSP 370. That only sounds more impressive once you realize the majority of wireless headsets can only report around 30 or 40 hours.\n\u2705 Battery is everything: If you don't want to think about plugging in your headset a few hours before a session, this massive 300 hour charge is going to see you right. Considering HyperX hasn't sacrificed weight or audio quality to bring such a massive battery to its wireless headset, this is a seriously impressive piece of kit.\n\u2705 You mostly play single player: The reduced mic quality means the HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless is best serving solo players. If your library is more story / adventure based, you're going to have a great time here.\n\u274c You play online with chat: We found the microphone on this headset to be particularly disappointing. Between crackly and muffled audio and poor pickup, the boom has to be pretty much in your mouth for any semblance of useable audio. This is definitely not one for online multiplayer.\n\u274c Charging isn't a hassle: If you don't mind plugging in every now and then you can find better headsets on the market that won't reach the same battery mileage. The Sennheiser GSP 370, for example, still manages to pack 100 hours while also nailing the microphone.\nDesign: HyperX headsets don't fall far from the tree, so the Cloud Alpha Wireless could easily be mistaken for the standard Cloud model. That said, we're big fans of those sturdy red arches, as well as the exquisite stitching running across the chunky headband. The red and black aesthetic pops color into your setup while still managing to look slick and suave - and the cherry on the cake is that comfort. With a goldilocks weight, we were able to keep these cups on the noggin for hours at a time.\nFeatures: The HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless is not going to cut it if you play a lot of online multiplayer. While we've always been impressed by HyperX's boom mics, this particular implementation does a severe disservice to the brand. Audio was both crackly and muffled in chat and on work calls, with the only resolution being to move the mic directly next to the mouth and upping the sensitivity levels.\nOnto that 300 hour battery, though. When we first heard of such a revolution we were sceptical. How much does this thing weigh? Is it actually alive for 300 hours of gameplay, or is this a theoretical number based on simplistic battery tests? Once we got it in our hands, though, it was obvious this is the real deal.\nWe took it out of the box, charged it all the way up and just played... and played... and played. We counted up to 110 hours of total battery life at the start of our testing and then gave up scratching tallies in the wall - we were still at 70% capacity at that time. HyperX isn't lying to you here, this is a game-changer. And yet this thing weighs only 322g - well within the reasonable range for a comfortable headset.\nAudio: Sacrifices haven't been made in the audio quality department to achieve such a battery feat either. The wireless edition is every bit as punchy as its cabled companion - the HyperX Cloud Alpha featured further up the page. Everything from the expansive open worlds of Red Dead Redemption 2 and Assassin's Creed: Valhalla to the densely populated street sounds of Spider-Man: Miles Morales was represented beautifully, with careful attention to detail at all ranges. What's more, music and TV were equally impactful.\nVerdict: The only gaming headset that comes close to the HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless's battery life in the Sennheiser GSP 370 - and you're dropping 200 hours. This is the absolute best option for those playing single player for multiple sessions without charging in between. However, it's worth noting that Sennheiser's option does bolster your mic performance while still offering plenty of juice - so should be considered if you play with chat.\nRead our full HyperX Cloud Alpha Wireless review for more.\nComfort | 4/5 |\nAudio | 4/5 |\nBattery | 5/5 |\nMicrophone | 1/5 |\nVersatility | 3/5 |\nBuild quality | 4/5 |\nThe best gaming headsets coming soon\nUpcoming gaming headset reviews: This month, I'm testing a wide range of PC-compatible audio tech, including the Logitech Lightspeed G522 wireless headset and the Razer Clio wireless speaker cushion. Afterwards, I'll also be taking a look at the Skullcandy Crusher PLYR 720 gaming headset, and more headsets that are due to come my way.\nHow we test the best gaming headsets\nWe test gaming headsets across a minimum of two weeks per device, but this isn't just a lab of metrics. We live, work, and play with every gaming headset that cross our paths during this time, inserting them into our own PC and console setups and living with them as if they were here to stay. That means we can get to know the intricacies of each device particularly well, while also making sure their features, design, and overall performance are on par with the rest of the market in terms of value.\nThe first thing we clock about a gaming headset is its design. Of course, we've all got our own snap feelings when we first pull a device out of the box but outside of aesthetics we're constantly on the lookout for any indication that a gaming headset's build quality might not go the distance. That means noting the materials used across chassis, struts, cup cushioning and cover, and charging cables, as well as the actual joinery of everything together. We're listening and feeling for any rattle or creaking during everyday use (and slightly more pressured handling). Then we consider design from a comfort perspective, balancing the weight, padding, adjustment options, and clamp force over long sessions of around eight hours. Typically this will take place during a work day, wearing the headset for music for an extended period of time, but this testing will also often take place during longer gaming sessions as well.\nWe assess a gaming headset's feature list according to value for money and overall quality. That means we're looking at what a headset does and doesn't offer compared to the rest of the competition (wireless connection options, EQ settings, microphone placement, onboard controls, additional software customizations, charging features, and battery life makes up the bulk of this). However our focus on these features allows us to make a wider assessment of the versatility and ease of use of each headset.\nTesting gaming headset performance is a big undertaking. One soundstage may be perfect to one player and lacking for another - audio itself can still be fairly subjective. That's why we test each headset across the same games, with each title offering a slightly different challenge for the drivers.\nMarvel Rivals and CS2 are our competitive games of choice, used for testing directional accuracy, microphone clarity, and soundstage imaging, particularly in the lower mid-range. We use a wider open scene with a couple of nearby machines in Horizon Forbidden West to see how well each headset deals with a cluttered mid-range, and how well it balances these more clustered scenes. Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales is used to measure directional audio in a busier scene (the main mission Time To Rally). Doom Eternal tests a gaming headset's power in the lower range, as well as the depth of its soundstage. Dead by Daylight is used to measure a less busy, but more atmospheric, environmental soundstage and how it places voice-chat within the audio soundscape.\nWe finally use each headset across a few levels of Super Mario Sunshine or Super Mario Galaxy to assess the handling of higher ranges as well. Some game choices can differ depending on any given reviewer's access, and it's always pertinent to test headsets during a whole range of games, including titles even outside our specified list. Ensuring we're using not just the same games across each headset we test, but also brand-new releases is pertinent to recommending each and every set of cups.\nOnce each headset makes it through the full testing process, it is assigned scores based on comfort, audio, battery, microphone, versatility, and build quality for each comparison across previous reviews. We're constantly comparing headsets to their similarly priced competitors - often switching back and forth between the devices during testing.\nFor more information on how we test gaming headsets, check out the full GamesRadar+ Hardware Policy.\nAlso tested\nWe're constantly testing gaming headsets to make sure that the list above is up to date with the latest and greatest devices on the market. That means many of the cups we review don't make the final top list. You'll find the gaming headsets we've recently had on the bench just below.\nTurtle Beach Airlite Fit wired gaming headset | Available at Amazon\nThe Turtle Beach Airlite Fit is an officially licensed wired headset for the Nintendo Switch, that's also available for the Switch 2, as it just requires use of the 2.5mm headphone jack to get going. This is a no-fuss pair of cups, and comes equipped with a flip-to-use microphone and 40mm speakers, that's ideal for anyone who wants a budget-friendly audio option for handheld gaming. But it doesn't have the feature-full chops to push any of the best gaming headsets off this list.\nSennheiser HD 550 gaming headphones | Available from Sennheiser\nThe Sennheiser HD 550 gaming headphones are just that, headphones, and so they can't qualify for a part on this list. Their $349.99 / \u00a3249.99 price range, although similar to alternatives like the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless, they are lacking any of the same features and just have a wired connection, and come with a jack adaptor, and are open-back to produce a more natural sound. They are compatible with a range of platforms because of their wired compatibility, but players will find limited use with the lack of a microphone, unless they're specifically looking for a high-quality sounding pair of cups they could also use for gaming on the side.\nCorsair Void Wireless V2 | Available at Amazon\nThe Corsair Void Wireless V2 is the latest budget pair of cups from Corsair, yet while it's low on price, the headset isn't low on quality. At $119.99 / \u00a399.99 the Void V2 still manages to pack in custom 50mm Neodymium drivers, which I wouldn't expect for the around $100 price tag, not to mention a great-sounding microphone, and two strips of customizable RGB lighting. As a wireless headset with both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz options, it's still pricer than the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1, and even the Razer Barracuda X. The latter of which also provides a wired option with the Void V2 is lacking, which is why it doesn't quite knock either off the best gaming headlist list, for now.\nCorsair Void Wireless V2 review\nCorsair Virtuoso Max Wireless | Available at Amazon\nThe Corsair Virtuoso Max Wireless headset is a premium set of cups, in both features and cost, and used to be our top pick for the best for most gaming headset. However, at $330/ \u00a3279.99, it was one of the priciest headsets on the list, and I felt that the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3 Wireless would be a better pick for those with small and big budgets alike. If you have the cash to burn, however, the Virtuoso Max is still a mighty pick that packs in ANC, Dolby Atmos audio, customizable lighting, a high-quality mic, an included hardbound case, and powerful 50mm Custom Graphene audio drivers into one high-end pair of cups.\nCorsair Virtuoso Max Wireless headset review\nOXS Storm G2 wireless headset | Available at Amazon\nThe OXS Storm G2 wireless gaming headset stands out from the rest due to its unique off-white design, however, it's not compatible with Xbox consoles. While it brings wired, Bluetooth, and 2.4GHz connectivity to the table, its Bluetooth also does work with the PS4/PS5, making its multi-platform compatibility fairly limited. The Storm G2 does pack an impressive mic and comfortable fit in a sub $100 price range, however, its bad audio quality and cheap-feeling build means it's not a viable entry as one of the best gaming headsets out there.\nOXS Storm G2 wireless headset review\nTurtle Beach Stealth 700 Gen 3 | Available at Amazon\nThe Stealth 700 Gen 3 is the latest addition to the Stealth headset line, introducing high-end 60mm dual eclipse audio drivers to a mid-range pair of cups with a $199.99 / \u00a3179.99 price point. This headset has an impressive list of features, from up to 80 hours of battery life to some of the best-sounding audio found in a headset. However, it's more expensive than its mid-range rivals and doesn't quite live up to the comfort and design set by alternatives like the Razer BlackShark V2 Pro.\nAlienware Pro Wireless headset | Available at Amazon\nThe Alienware Pro Wireless gaming headset is a sleek entry for the Alienware brand which sits on the mid-range of the market with its $229.99 / \u00a3221.99 price point. While it's pricier than other mid-range cups, it sets itself apart with its active noise canceling and wider 20Hz - 40kHz frequency range while still ensuring a comfy fit. As it stands, the Alienware Pro Wireless headset is a cheaper alternative than the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless, which reigns supreme in our best gaming headset list. However, the Arctis Nova Pro is still our top pick due to its flexible mic integration, hot-swappable batteries, and high-end audio quality that the Alienware Pro pair of cups doesn't quite live up to.\nAlienware Pro Wireless headset review\nAsus ROG Delta II | Available at Amazon\nThe Asus ROG Delta II headset introduces a lot of modern enhancements to the Delta headline line, most notably the mid-range set of cups can simultaneously connect to consoles via Bluetooth and 2.4Ghz. At $229 / \u00a3219, while an impressive piece of tech, it feels like a weaker package compared to Razer's BlackShark V2 Hyperspeed or the SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5 wireless headset already part of this list.\nRazer Barracuda X Chroma | Available at Amazon\nThe Razer Barracuda X Chroma (2024) introduces RGB lighting to the Barracuda lineup for the first time and still manages to uphold the sound and build quality that the previous headsets established. The multi-platform excellence providing an easy switch between Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless connections is still on full display, but this flashy add-on comes at a cost of $129.99/\u00a3129.99 making the previous model a more budget-friendly option.\nRazer Blackshark V2 Hyperspeed | Available at Amazon\nThe Razer Blackshark V2 Hyperspeed may be an older entry in the Blackshark line, but at $129.99 / \u00a3129.99 it's still one of the best mid-range headsets cash can buy. The headset packs in Razer's iconic Razer TriForce Titanium 50mm audio drivers and can regularly be found below the $100 mark during sales and discounts - making it a viable choice at one of the best budget headsets available today.\nTurtle Beach Stealth 500 | Available at Amazon\nThe Turtle Beach Stealth 500 is a solid proposition in its own right, offering both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless connections with a comfortable ski-style headband design for just $79.99 / \u00a379.99. However, it's not doing enough to make the $20 leap to the Stealth 600 Gen 3 feel unwarranted, and does pose its own durability concerns from testing.\nTurtle Beach Stealth 600 Gen 3 Wireless | Available at Amazon\nTurtle Beach's latest Stealth headset is a fantastic buy at under $100 / \u00a3100, but it's a jack of all trades without mastering anything in particular. It's a solid all-rounder without the edge to see it nail a spot among the greats.\nHyperX Cloud 3 Wireless | Available at Amazon\nThe HyperX Cloud 3 Wireless certainly packs an impressive battery - second only to the Cloud Alpha featured above. However, its limited connectivity options mean it's not as practical as other headsets in its price range.\nCorsair HS80 Max | Available at Amazon\nThe Corsair HS80 Max is pitching at a fairly luxury price point, but doesn't offer the mic quality, comfort level, or versatility to truly nail its market. It's still a solid headset, especially if you don't want to tinker with EQ settings too much.\nPanasonic Soundslayer Wireless | Available at Amazon\nWhile it's not quite a gaming headset, the wearable speaker is still designed to offer immersive game audio. The difference here is your ears are left completely free - that's comfortable and far easier if you need to stay tuned into your surroundings. However, audio quality takes a serious hit. This isn't one for those serious about sound.\nLogitech G Pro X 2 | Available at Amazon\nThe Logitech G Pro X2 is a fantastic headset by itself, but its lower quality microphone and USB-A 2.4GHz receiver keep it from truly being the best for PC. It's still a solid set of graphene cups with an excellent battery life to boot.\nSony Inzone H5 | Available at Amazon\nThe Sony Inzone H5 sits between the PC and PS5, but unfortunately it can't quite hit enough boxes for each system to stand out in either. Your configured settings on PC don't transfer to PS5, but there's no Bluetooth for dual PC use either. There's no killer feature to put it in either camp right now, so it slips the net.\nRIG 800 Pro HS | Available at Amazon\nThe RIG 800 Pro HS is a particularly comfortable headset, and it comes with a charging dock for a fraction of the Astro A50's price. However, its cheaper construction, older ports, and lower quality audio mean it's not a top shelf item.\nTurtle Beach Stealth Pro | Available at Amazon\nThe Turtle Beach Stealth Pro is a fantastic headset, and it actually featured as our favorite multiplatform device before the Astro A50X came along. Without that smart switcher, and with a weaker battery system than the Nova Pro Wireless, though, it's a little stranded now.\nHow to choose the right gaming headset\nWhy you can trust GamesRadar+\nFinding the right gaming headset for you comes down to a series of factors; what, how, where, and when you play. Each of these factors has a different bearing on the connection, overall design, microphone, and battery life of your device. Of course we all want the best audio experience possible - but finding the right combination of these extra features can help you get the best value for money overall.\nThat's because some players might be able to drop more expensive features like wireless connections or high-end microphones in order to pick up far better sound quality for their money overall. On the other hand, some may prefer to put more cash towards a long-lasting battery life and versatile suite of connections rather than prioritizing competition-level sound. Finding the right balance of priorities can help you find the right headset at the right price.\nWireless connection\nA wireless connection can still add a premium to your price tag, especially if you're looking at dual Bluetooth and 2.4GHz devices. However, if you want ultimate versatility with other devices it's well worth investing in (RIP the 3.5mm jack).\nPC, console, and handheld players can all find value in a wireless connection; they're far less messy overall. However, it's the players who also want their headset to double as a set of headphones that will get the most out of them.\nIt's worth noting that the vast majority of headsets released at the moment are wireless. There are still wired-only models floating around, but they tend to stick to the bottom of the price range.\nForm factor\nForm factor might make more of an impact on the versatility of a headset than its connection at this point in time. Gaming headset still look like they're built for games - which isn't ideal when you want your premium purchase to double up outside of the house. If you want to use your headset on your commute, I'd recommend picking up a smaller 40mm set of cups with full 180 degrees of rotation in the hinge and a softer, less angular design.\nForm factor also balances the weight of your headset. If you know you're going to be playing for long periods of time, it's well worth prioritizing a lightweight device. While you might drop a little battery life, the benefits to your skull are immeasurable. 240g - 280g is considered nicely lightweight.\nMicrophone\nThis might be an easy no-brainer, but it's worth investigating the microphone options available to you. If you only play with chat on, you'll want to invest a little more in your microphone quality than someone who only plays solo. On the flip side of that, it's well worth making sure that your microphone is detachable if you do play single player - there's nothing more annoying than an extra boom in your face that you never need. A lot of headsets now ship with flip-to-mute mics or arms hidden inside the cups themselves. While they're often a little more expensive, this is the best option for those who swap between playstyles as you'll never have to worry about losing that extra accessory.\nBattery life\nThere are headsets out there that max out battery life but drastically sacrifice other features to get there (looking at you HyperX). In general, most headsets aim for around 50 - 100 hours of battery. If you play for a couple of hours every evening, that will see you sorted for a good few weeks.\nI would recommend moving to the top of this range if you regularly play on a handheld on the go, or in a travelling setup. There's nothing worse than forgetting to plug in the night before and being met with a beeping headset first thing in the morning. However, if you only ever tend to play at home, you can afford to shrink your battery in favor of other features like audio quality or a lower weight - especially if the headset offers a wired connection as well.\nWhether you play competitively or solo, at home or on the road, exclusively on Switch or on a $6K gaming PC, finding the right balance between your connection, form factor, microphone, and battery life can narrow the playing field considerably. Once you know what to prioritize you've found your ideal gaming headset - it's just a case of scouting the model that fits the bill.\nBest gaming headset: FAQ\nWhat is the best gaming headset in 2025?\nThe best gaming headset right now is the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless, though with a hefty price point it's certainly not going to be right for everyone. If you're looking to spend less than $50 / \u00a350, the Corsair HS35 is the best gaming headset for you. Meanwhile, anyone after a mid-range $60 - $100 / \u00a360 - \u00a3100 headset should invest in the Razer Barracuda X or the Razer Barracuda X Chroma (it's upgraded RGB counterpart).\nHow much does a gaming headset cost?\nGaming headsets come in a range of different configurations and, therefore, prices. At the budget end you can expect to pay between $40 and $60 / \u00a340 and \u00a360 for a wired headset with solid stereo audio quality, basic drivers, and a detachable boom microphone for online play. As we near the $100 / \u00a3100 mark you'll find more surround sound and wireless options, larger drivers, and additional EQ customization options.\nThe $100 - $200 / \u00a3100 - \u00a3200 price range is the most competitive. This is the upper mid-range where we tend to see high value gaming headsets offering premium features with some sacrifices to build or additional extras. Drivers and surround sound qualities will all be improved dramatically in this price range, and you'll find higher quality materials (which means a more comfortable form factor and longer lasting durability). You're also more likely to pick up split connections in this price range, allowing you to swap between a 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connection with different devices.\nGaming headsets over $200 / \u00a3200 will feature the latest and greatest in audio technology, long battery lives, in-depth EQ settings, and other quality of life features like active noise cancellation.\nWhat is the best gaming headset brand?\nThere are plenty of gaming headset brands out there competing for your cash. In our experience, though, the best are SteelSeries, Razer, Corsair, Turtle Beach, HyperX, and Astro.\nIs a wired or wireless gaming headset better?\nSome gaming headsets are definitely better than others. Yet whether a wired or wireless gaming headset is better depends on how and what you use your gaming headsets for, and of course, personal preference.\nTypically wired headsets are cheaper, making them ideal for those with a strict budget to stick to. If keeping the price low is a priority then a wired pair will likely be more up your alley and a better choice overall. Plus, if you want absolutely zero latency in your day-to-day gaming, the reliability of a wired gaming headset is hard to best.\nHowever, many of us prefer the freedom of a wireless connection. Wireless headsets have the main benefit of letting you move around, just so long as you don't wander too far out of the range the headset is capable of. With a lot of other tech, like smartphones, also lacking headphone jacks, wireless headsets can also be a great alternative to a normal pair of headphones.\nThe setup process of a wireless gaming headset can be dependent on the brand and can be subject to latency issues whether you're connecting up via Bluetooth or 2.4 GHz. So if you prefer a more straightforward plug-in-and-play connection, wired is the way to go. Again, it's all dependant on how you prefer to play your favorite games, and whether you value affordability and lack of latency over freedom of movement.\nIf any wired pair of cups isn't for you, our best wireless headset guide is full to the brim with purely wireless peripherals - no being at the mercy of wires there. If you're looking for a pair specifically for your console of choice be sure to check out our best Nintendo Switch headsets, best PS5 headsets, or our best Xbox Series X headsets guides instead.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nEver since I first held a NES controller in my hand I've been obsessed with gaming, and the hardware it runs on. I could hook up a NES and SNES to a telly, without instructions, before I could walk. Even now, nothing is more exciting then taking a console, or handheld, out the box for the first time and setting it up. This obsession transformed into a love of games and game music, which lead to my music degree and dream of becoming the Scottish Nobuo Uematsu. After sharing my love of games through music, I began to share my love through words on sites like TechRadar and iMore. This lead to becoming a Hardware staff writer for PCGamesN, and later the Senior Tech Writer for Dexerto, covering all things Steam Deck, PlayStation and Nintendo. With that experience, I was able to level up as Hardware Editor for GamesRadar+, where I'm still just as Nintendo, PlayStation and gaming tech obsessed as ever.\n- Tabitha BakerManaging Editor - Hardware"
