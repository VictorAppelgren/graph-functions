  "title": "Keir Starmer issued brutal 'red tape' warning over thousands of Brits in crisis",
  "description": "A charity has warned that many working Britons are struggling to feed themselves and their families, and are unable to know if they are entitled to help.",
  "content": "A food club chain founder said Labour must end UK food poverty, as his volunteers treat 4,500 more families to hot meals over the summer holiday. Father-of-two Mark Game, 56, set up 'The Bread and Butter Thing' in Manchester with partner Jane from the back of a van in 2016, to help those battling on the breadline. Now the charity, which charges just \u00a38.50 for three big bags of fruit and veg, cupboard staples and chilled goods to needy members, operates 145 hubs from Northumberland to Maidstone, helping 100,000 people. Their recent study found that after paying for rent and energy bills, almost 70% of households have less than \u00a350 per person each month to cover food, clothing, toiletries, transport and other essentials.\n\nThis summer, thanks to Sainsbury\u2019s Nourish the Nation campaign and Comic Relief, they are creating 4,549 activity places for kids who don\u2019t meet the Department for Education\u2019s Holiday Activities and Food Programme (HAF) criteria. But founder Mark told the Daily Express that more struggling Britons are being denied access to vital benefits and support by endless government red tape. He told us: \"We have to recognise just how difficult it is for everyday people just to be able to get by. \"People are stopping going on holidays, people are seeing takeaways as a luxury, and these are families that are just working every day and in reasonable jobs. These are not people who are destitute. \"A recent study said annually there's about \u00a322 billion worth of unclaimed benefits. And this is because of all the barriers that are in place. The government doesn't spend time trying to tell people what's available.\" The Bread and Butter Thing was founded by Mark and his partner in 2016 with a simple but powerful mission: to make life easier for people struggling to feed themselves or their families. It describes its food clubs as \"the secret weapon in the fight against food insecurity, solving two problems in one go \u2013 diverting surplus food and filling empty fridges.\" Mark said: \"Each food club that we run can serve about 80 families a week. We offer a bag of cupboard goods, a bag of fruit and veg and a bag of chilled goods. And it's a push model, a bit like a veg box scheme. \"You get what you're given because it's surplus on the day, and it's whatever we've got. But it's nutritious. \"We see a lot of people who have disabilities, on benefits, low income from work or retired with no pension. They're not destitute, but they're stretched, they're strained, they're really struggling. \"One accident or one need of a school uniform can tip them over the edge. Over half of our members are in work. We'll see nurses, teaching assistants, carers, cleaners, builders and network IT consultants. \"One member I can think of is a data analyst for the Ministry of Justice. I say 'a data analyst, that's a decent wage. Why are you coming?' He said 'when I came out of my fixed term on my mortgage, my mortgage quadrupled!'\"\n\nEarlier this year, the charity released their 'Slice of Life' report, which urged Labour to simplify systems and introduce auto-enrolment for people who qualify for low-income benefits - using \"existing data to reduce bureaucracy and ensure people receive the help they qualify for\". Policy in Practice's \"Missing Out 2024\" study revealed \u00a322.7 billion of income-related benefits and social tariffs go unclaimed in the UK annually - a significant increase from previous estimates. Mark explained: \"If you're a working family and you don't engage with the job centre, then where do you go to understand what help is available for you? \"If people are actually working, why should we make it difficult for them to actually access this additional support that's out there for them? \"So it's really easy to fix - you auto-enrol people. The government knows exactly who's on what pay rate and who should be able to actually access these benefits. \"I'll give you an example. The NHS has something called the Low Income Scheme for dentistry and optometry, but it's a 20-page application form! It's just so difficult. \"The Government doesn't spend time trying to tell people what benefits are available. There's no central resource to be able to actually find this stuff. \"If you lose a job tomorrow, you've got a hell of a lot of Googling and phone calls to make to find out what's actually out there for you.\" It's claimed that 45% of working households do not know what support they\u2019re entitled to, and almost a quarter say they don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re receiving their full entitlements. In addition to auto-enrolling people on benefits and increasing funding of holiday clubs, Mark said the government could also consider widening eligibility for children to have free school meals and, crucially, tackling food inflation costs. He added: \"Food is getting more and more expensive, but because it's been happening for so long, it's almost normalised.\" In June, The Bread and Butter Thing was awarded \u00a31,264,774 in funding from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) as part of its Tackling Food Surplus at the Farm Gate programme. Every year, an estimated 330,000 tonnes of edible food are either wasted or repurposed as animal feed before leaving farm gates.\n\nAnd now that the summer holidays are in full swing, The Bread and Butter Thing has been able to help more families have a break with its Holiday Activities and Food (HAF) Around the Hub programme. Funded through Sainsbury\u2019s and Comic Relief, the initiative includes creative activities, day trips, hot meals, and a free food shop at The Bread and Butter Thing. The programme will support 33 communities and create 4,549 places for children who don\u2019t meet the Department for Education\u2019s HAF criteria. In addition to the HAF activity over the six-week summer period, The Bread and Butter Thing will distribute an estimated 600,000 food bag sets to its members with children at home. Vic Harper, CEO of The Bread and Butter Thing says: \"We know that money gets tighter over the school holidays, when support drops away, but pressures only increase. \"We hear from our communities that programmes like HAF Around the Hub are allowing for valuable memories to be made with their children, despite the current financial challenges. \"Holiday provision is vital, but so is consistency; that\u2019s why we keep all our food clubs running throughout summer. Providing access to affordable, nutritious food is an everyday thing, not just a term thing.\" Samir Patel, CEO of Comic Relief said: \"Food poverty is a reality facing millions of people across the UK this summer and for so many families who are already on the brink financially, the need to provide extra food for their children during the holidays only adds to worries and concerns that are being felt every day. \"We\u2019re proud to be supporting The Bread and Butter Thing and their vitally important work that is providing access to essentials, nutritious food, and creative activities that are helping to ease the burden on families during the holidays.\" The Government told us a total of \u00a31 billion to reform crisis support has been announced in the Spending Review with their Child Poverty Taskforce building an ambitious strategy to reduce child poverty as part of the Plan for Change. They added: \"This Government is determined to change people\u2019s lives for the better, helping them out of poverty and tackling the unacceptable rise in food bank dependence in recent years. \"As part of our Plan for Change, we are offering free school meals to every single child from a household that claims Universal Credit, lifting 100,000 children out of poverty, as well as making changes to Universal Credit to give a \u00a3420 boost to over one million households.\" \"We are also reforming the social security system so it genuinely supports those who can work into employment and ensures the safety net will always be there for the most vulnerable.\" * To donate and support The Bread and Butter Thing visit https://www.breadandbutterthing.org/",

      "text": "A Slice of Life\nIf help exists but no one knows about it... is it really help?\nMillions of working families are missing out on vital support because they don\u2019t even know it exists. Or worse, they know it exists but can\u2019t access it due to overcomplicated paperwork. And that\u2019s why we're making waves on the Thames. To launch our latest piece of research, the Slice of Life report, right in the heart of Westminster to highlight a broken system that\u2019s failing working people who are struggling to keep their heads above water.\nWe know that there is no such thing as a \u2018typical\u2019 Bread and Butter member. And as part of our latest survey, we wanted to share what life really looks like for our membership. Our members are from diverse backgrounds and household types, yet they all have one thing in common: each week, they maximise their income, connect with their community and improve their diets simply by coming to our food clubs.\nThis year\u2019s survey shows that while food banks are crucial in a crisis, long-term solutions like our food clubs are key for lasting food security. Ultimately, our findings show how financial instability, food insecurity, and support systems are all interconnected and stress the importance of community.\nDownload links\nWhat\u2019s needed?\nA national food security strategy that reduces need for crisis support:\nThe government\u2019s upcoming food strategy must prioritise prevention, ensuring families are supported before falling into crisis. This should include expanding affordable food access, school meal programmes, and affordable nutritional initiatives. Food insecurity must be treated as a systemic issue connected to low wages, housing, and social support; not just a series of isolated crises.\nToo many working families miss out on the support they are entitled to due to complex application processes. The government should simplify systems and introduce auto-enrolment where possible, using existing data to reduce bureaucracy and ensure people receive the help they qualify for.\nSimplifying and streamlining access to government support:\nMany working households fall through the cracks\u2014earning too much for help but too little to cover essential costs. Life is not affordable. Expanding eligibility criteria for support schemes would provide critical relief to families struggling with the cost of living.\nRaising eligibility thresholds for financial support:\nGovernment must ensure that affordability\u2014for food, housing, and essentials\u2014is a core principle across all policy making. Strategies should reduce reliance on emergency support and focus on sustainable solutions that lift communities out of persistent hardship.\nEmbed long-term affordability in future policy design:\nWhy we're taking our message to Westminster: Life isn't affordable and people cannot keep their heads above water\nAt The Bread and Butter Thing, we\u2019re known for our food clubs, not for political stunts. But sometimes, when the reality on the ground is being ignored in Westminster, we must speak out, and raise our voices.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re heading to Parliament. Not with placards and protest chants, but with a powerful visual of people barely keeping their heads above water. Because that's what life feels like for millions across the UK right now.\nRead more about it right here\nHelp is out there and we\u2019re on a mission to make it easier to access\nAs a start, we\u2019ve pulled together an easy-to-use snapshot of all the Government and charity support that exists out there, from energy advice to NHS low-income support and more. Take a closer look right here\u2026\nListen to our Slice of Life podcast special\nMeet Carer James, a support worker and devoted young dad doing everything he can to make sure his little boy is well fed.
