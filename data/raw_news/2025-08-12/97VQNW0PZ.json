But which among those are the best airline credit cards? The answer depends on what you\u2019re looking for in terms of benefits and future travel, as well as which airline or airlines you fly most often. We\u2019ve analyzed all the cards out there and picked our favorites, so you can make a choice based on the rewards the cards can earn you and the perks you get, both when you\u2019re flying and when you aren\u2019t.\n\nDive into the details of the best airline cards with us to see how they stack up.\n\nShould you have an airline credit card?\n\nAirline-branded cards typically offer perks with that airline and earn miles in its loyalty program, with a multiplier for each dollar spent on purchases with the carrier. The higher the annual fee, the more valuable the airline-specific perks. For example, a card without an annual fee may offer elevated earnings on spending with the airline but no free checked baggage or early boarding. Conversely, an airline\u2019s top co-branded card with an annual fee in the hundreds may offer access to the airline\u2019s lounges as well as other benefits. Often, airline cards come with an accelerated path to elite status with that airline too.\n\nThat said, airline cards only make sense for people who fly or plan to fly a given airline often enough. For those who don\u2019t but still want to earn points that can be redeemed for travel, general travel rewards cards may make more sense. Those cards earn points that can be transferred to airlines and hotels or redeemed on the card issuer\u2019s own travel portal, and they often come with travel protections like insurance for delays or lost luggage.\n\nThe choice boils down to loyalty to an airline versus earning credit card points that are more flexible than airline miles. Once you\u2019ve earned a mile with Delta, for instance, it can only be redeemed for travel on Delta itself or its partners, but if you\u2019ve earned an American Express point, you can transfer it to a vast number of airlines.\n\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s look at our picks among airline cards and travel cards that earn points transferrable to airlines.\n\nYou might be surprised to see a card without an airline\u2019s name in this list, but the Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card earns its place here thanks to the flexibility of Chase Ultimate Rewards points.\n\nThis card won\u2019t get you free checked bags or special privileges on any airline, nor does it provide lounge access. But it will let you accumulate 2 points per every dollar spent on all travel, 5 points on all travel booked through the Chase Travel\u2120 portal and 3 points on dining, among other bonus reward categories. You\u2019ll then be able to redeem those points for flights, including in premium cabins, which may come with lounge access, free checked luggage and other perks as part of the ticket.\n\nThe more flexible option is to redeem your Chase points through the Chase Travel portal. When you redeem this way, you can book any flight without worrying about award availability or blackout dates. If you can normally pay for it with cash, then you can pay for it with points this way.\n\nYou\u2019ll get at least 1 cent per point when you have the Chase Sapphire Preferred and redeem your rewards this way, and you\u2019ll even earn airline miles for the flight because airlines consider these tickets as regular airfare, not award redemption. But you can do better than that: If you opened your Chase Sapphire Preferred account after June 23, 2025, you can take advantage of a feature called Points Plus. When you see a Points Plus icon in the Chase Travel portal, your points are worth more when redeemed for that particular itinerary: up to 1.5x on hotels and flights with select airlines, and up to 1.75x on premium cabin tickets on select airlines. If your account was opened before June 23, points earned before Oct. 26 of this year can be redeemed at 1.25 cents per point until Oct. 26, 2027, and for 1 cent after that. Or, legacy cardmembers can also redeem their points for an increased value through the Points Plus option if it serves as a better redemption value.\n\nBut there\u2019s another option. You can instead transfer your points to any of Chase\u2019s 11 airline partners, including Southwest Airlines, JetBlue, United Airlines, British Airways, Emirates and Air Canada, or three hotel partners: IHG, Marriott and Hyatt.\n\nChase points transfer at a 1-to-1 ratio \u2014 meaning you\u2019ll get 1,000 airline miles for every 1,000 Chase points you transfer \u2014 and you can then book using the miles or points in that airline or hotel program. However, you\u2019ll only be able to book seats that are available for award redemptions, which usually doesn\u2019t include every flight.\n\nWhy would you book this way when you can get any flight using the first option? Because you can potentially get a lot more value for your points when you transfer them, especially if you\u2019re looking to fly internationally in a first- or business-class cabin. That\u2019s why frequent flyer website The Points Guy values Ultimate Rewards points at 2.05 cents apiece.\n\nThe annual fee on the Chase Sapphire Preferred is a relatively low $95 a year. Especially if you\u2019re a beginner, paying less than $100 for a travel credit card is a great way to learn more about the various airline partner programs.\n\nEven with a low annual fee, you\u2019ll find that many useful travel insurance benefits come with the Chase Sapphire Preferred. For example, when you pay for travel with the card, you\u2019ll be covered if your trip is canceled for any covered reason, up to $10,000 per person and $20,000 per trip. You\u2019ll also be reimbursed for any covered out-of-pocket expenses, up to $500 per person, if your flight is delayed by at least 12 hours or requires an overnight stay.\n\nDespite a very high $795 annual fee, the Chase Sapphire Reserve\u00ae comes with several travel perks, including a $300 yearly travel credit, a $120 Lyft credit, complimentary Priority Pass Select airport lounge access and more. Like the Sapphire Preferred, it isn\u2019t an airline card per se, but it earns points that can be turned into flights on a vast number of airlines.\n\nWe\u2019re including it in this article because it\u2019s the best card when it comes to travel protections. In fact, it\u2019s the only card that offers all seven major types of coverage: trip cancellation/interruption insurance, trip delay reimbursement, lost luggage reimbursement, baggage delay insurance, rental car protection, travel accident insurance and emergency evacuation assistance.\n\nWhen it comes to redeeming credit card rewards for air travel, the Chase Sapphire Reserve works similarly to the Chase Sapphire Preferred but with a few key differences.\n\nBoth cards earn Ultimate Rewards points, so you can redeem them the same way: at a fixed rate through the Chase travel portal or by transferring them to Chase\u2019s partners at a 1-to-1 ratio. The big difference is that your points are worth up to 2 cents apiece when you redeem them via the Chase portal with the Sapphire Reserve using Points Boost, where it\u2019s available. On all other purchases on Chase Travel, you\u2019ll get 1.5 cents per point (for cardmembers who opened their card prior to June 23, 2025 on points earned before Oct. 26, 2025, and redeemed until Oct. 26, 2027; after that, they\u2019ll be valued 1 cent.)\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Reserve also offers a great earning rate on airfare and hotels booked directly with providers, where you\u2019ll earn 4 points for every dollar. For purchases on Chase Travel, you\u2019ll get an exceptional 8x points. You\u2019ll also earn 3x on dining worldwide, making this a great card for frequent travelers \u2014 and one that doesn\u2019t tie them into a single airline\u2019s ecosystem.\n\nThe Platinum Card from American Express: Best for luxury travel\n\nThe Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express (see rates and fees) also isn\u2019t tied to a specific airline, but earns points that can be redeemed directly for any flight or transferred to many airlines and hotels, but with a set of partners that\u2019s different from Chase\u2019s credit cards.\n\nWhen it comes to earning points on airfare, the Amex Platinum has the highest earning rate of any credit card on our list. You\u2019ll earn 5 points for every dollar spent when booking directly with the airline or with American Express Travel\u00ae (up to $500,000 on these purchases per calendar year). That\u2019s more than the 4 points per dollar you\u2019ll earn with the Chase Sapphire Reserve, but you\u2019ll earn bonus points on many other travel purchases with the Chase card, while the Amex Platinum only earns those 5 points per dollar on airfare, as well as hotels and flights booked through American Express Travel.\n\nBut the Amex Platinum is best known for its luxury perks. For starters, just by being a card member, you\u2019ll have complimentary access to thousands of airport lounges around the world, including the exclusive American Express Centurion Lounges, Delta Sky Clubs when flying Delta (10 Sky Club day passes per Medallion year) and Priority Pass airport lounges (but not Priority Pass restaurants, and enrollment is required for Priority Pass).\n\nCard members also get complimentary Gold elite status with the Hilton and Marriott hotel chains, which can get you a late checkout, bonus points when staying on a paid rate, space-available upgraded rooms and complimentary breakfast at select properties (enrollment is required). You\u2019ll also have elite status with three car rental companies: Hertz (President\u2019s Circle), Avis (Preferred Plus) and National (Executive).\n\nNow, the Amex Platinum doesn\u2019t come cheap, with an annual fee of $695 per year. Fortunately, the many travel perks, along with yearly credits, can help offset the fee if you can take advantage of them.\n\nWhen it comes to transferring points, American Express has a wider selection than Chase, with 17 airlines and three hotel partners. In particular, American Express Membership Rewards\u00ae are the only credit card points issued in the US that transfer to Delta Air Lines.\n\nWith seven different Delta credit cards available \u2014 four personal and three business \u2014 there\u2019s a Delta card for all types of flyers. The Delta SkyMiles\u00ae Gold American Express Card will likely suit occasional Delta flyers the best. It has an introductory annual fee of $0 for the first year, and then a $150 annual fee starting at your first renewal (see rates and fees), so you can try out the card for a year to see if it\u2019s right for you.\n\nYou\u2019ll earn 2 Delta SkyMiles per dollar on purchases made directly with Delta with the Delta Gold Amex, as well as at restaurants worldwide (including takeout and delivery in the U.S.) and U.S. supermarkets. You\u2019ll also get priority boarding on Delta flights, a free checked bag when flying Delta and 20% off Delta in-flight purchases.\n\nRight now, the Amex Delta Gold also has a welcome offer of 70,000 SkyMiles after you spend $2,000 in the first six months, an exceptional number of miles for that spend. For reference, The Points Guy values 70,000 Delta miles at $840.\n\nAlso, if you spend $10,000 on the Delta Gold Amex card in a calendar year, you\u2019ll earn a Delta flight credit worth up to $200. So, if you\u2019re able to spend this much on your credit card each year, that alone will more than make up for its annual fee.\n\nHowever, if you expect to be in the air a lot more often, you might instead want to look at the Delta SkyMiles\u00ae Platinum American Express Card or the Delta SkyMiles\u00ae Reserve American Express Card. Both of these higher-end cards will help you earn Delta elite status quicker and come with more Delta perks, including an annual companion certificate after your first year.\n\nThe Delta Reserve card also provides access to Delta SkyClub and Amex Centurion Lounges when flying Delta. Of course, both of these premium Delta credit cards come with significantly higher annual fees, so the benefits may or may not justify the cost depending on how often you travel.\n\nThe New United Explorer Card: Best for United flyers\n\nIf you\u2019re a United frequent flyer like CNN Underscored travel editor Kyle Olsen, you could consider The New United\u2120 Explorer Card. It comes with no annual fee for the first year, then a $150 fee starting in the second year, allowing you to essentially try it out for no cost while determining if it works for your spending and travel habits.\n\nWith this card, you\u2019ll earn 2 miles for every dollar you spend on United, as well as at restaurants (including eligible delivery services) and on hotel stays booked directly with the hotel, plus 1 mile per dollar on everything else. That\u2019s not bad, but keep in mind that the Chase Sapphire Preferred earns 2 points per dollar on dining and all travel, and you can transfer Chase points to United.\n\nThat\u2019s why the real reason to have the New United Explorer Card is taking advantage of its perks, and not only when flying on United. Unique among airline credit at this annual fee level, it will reimburse you for up to $120 for a Global Entry or TSA PreCheck membership application fee. It also offers primary insurance coverage for rental cars, another unique feature among its peer airline cards.\n\nYou\u2019ll get priority boarding and earn 25% back on in-flight purchases when you\u2019re on a United flight, and you can check your first bag for free (as well as one for a traveling companion). The card also comes with two United Club lounge day passes per year.\n\nAnother interesting aspect for an airline card, it also offers an incentive to fly on a different carrier. You\u2019ll get up to $100 statement credit per year on flights booked directly with JSX, a company offering flights that depart from private terminals on smaller jets, on which you can earn United\u2019s own MileagePlus miles.\n\nIf Southwest is your airline of choice, you\u2019re aware that the biggest US carrier by domestic passengers has recently done away with its unique business model. Southwest has introduced assigned seating, premium seats and fees for checked baggage, like all other airlines in the country. (Assigned and premium seating will officially begin on Jan. 27, 2026, but baggage fees are already in effect.)\n\nThe airline has a spate of co-branded cards that can circumvent those fees, though. The Southwest Rapid Rewards\u00ae Priority Credit Card is the most expensive of the Southwest personal credit cards, with an annual fee of $229. Even with that annual cost, we chose it for this list because it comes with the most benefits, which are especially useful under the airline\u2019s new bag and seating policies.\n\nThe Southwest Priority card comes with a first checked bag free for the card holder and up to eight additional passengers on the same reservation. At $35 per checked bag per person, this benefit alone could surpass the cost of the annual fee. Beginning Jan. 27 of next year, it will also lets the card holder select a Preferred seat with more legroom at no charge, when available. Also on the same date, card holders and up to eight passengers on the same reservation will board early, with group 5.\n\nFurther, the points you earn on the Southwest Priority card \u2014 including the sign-up bonus \u2014 count as qualifying points toward the Southwest Companion Pass, and the card also awards an annual boost of 10,000 Companion Pass-qualifying points. Having the pass can save you thousands of dollars, as it allows a companion to fly with you for free (plus the minimal costs of taxes and fees) for the rest of the year in which you earned the pass, plus the entire following year.\n\nThe card also will get you 7,500 bonus points each anniversary year starting with your second year as a card holder, 25% back on inflight purchases like drinks and Wi-Fi, and 2,500 tier-qualifying points (TQPs) toward A-List status for every $5,000 spent in purchases annually, meaning you\u2019ll get to elite status on Southwest faster.\n\nThis could be a good card for people who spend a decent amount on gas and dining out, since the card earns 2 points per dollar on gas stations and restaurants. On Southwest purchases, it earns 4x.\n\nFor the occasional American Airlines flyer, the Citi\u00ae/AAdvantage\u00ae Platinum Select\u00ae World Elite Mastercard\u00ae is a great card, especially since there\u2019s no annual fee for the first year, then only $99 per year thereafter. While it isn\u2019t the best card to use on everyday spending since it earns 2x points only on restaurants and gas stations, as well as American Airlines purchases, you can save a lot of money with it on baggage fees.\n\nAll Citi AAdvantage Platinum card holders get a free checked bag on domestic American flights for not only themselves but up to four additional companions on the same reservation. With baggage fees starting at $35 per bag, a family of four all checking a bag can save $280 by flying just one round trip a year. That\u2019s almost three times the annual fee.\n\nCard holders also board before all other passengers in Main Cabin and get a 25% savings on in-flight food and beverage purchases on American Airlines flights. Spending $20,000 in purchases during the card membership year and renewing the credit triggers a $125 American Airlines flight discount.\n\nAlso, like other mid-tier airline cards, the AA Platinum Select has no foreign transaction fees.\n\nNow, if you fly American regularly, you might prefer the Citi\u00ae/AAdvantage\u00ae Executive World Elite Mastercard\u00ae instead, since it comes with an Admirals Club lounge membership and additional benefits. But the card isn\u2019t cheap at $595 a year, so it\u2019s probably best only for those who expect to be on an American plane at least monthly.\n\nJetBlue Plus Card: Best for JetBlue flyers\n\nJetBlue is only the seventh US airline by passengers carried, but it has a large share in major markets like New York City and Boston. People who fly it often will find value in the JetBlue Plus credit card, which earns a remarkable 6 points per dollar on JetBlue flights. It\u2019s not the top card for everyday spending, with 2 points per dollar at restaurants and grocery stores and 1 point per dollar on everything else, but it comes with some perks that can improve your experience when flying JetBlue.\n\nYou and up to three companions on the same reservation get a free checked bag when flying JetBlue, which can easily save you hundreds of dollars with just one trip. And while this card comes with a $99 annual fee, you\u2019ll earn 5,000 bonus points each year starting with your first account anniversary (meaning a year after you first get the card). These 5,000 points are worth about $72 according to The Points Guy, which offsets more than two-thirds of the cost of the card. And right now, the card has a remarkable welcome offer of 80,000 points after spending just $1,000 and paying the annual fee within 90 days from account opening. That amount of miles is worth $1,160.\n\nA notable feature of JetBlue points is that they can be pooled with family and friends, which makes it easier to hit the critical mass needed for a redemption. With this card, you\u2019ll also get 10% of your points back after you redeem for and travel on a JetBlue-operated award flight.\n\nCapital One Venture Credit Card: Best for ease of use\n\nThe Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card takes the cake when it comes to flexibility. This straightforward travel card earns 2 miles for every dollar you spend on it \u2014 no need to worry about bonus categories. You can then redeem your miles for any travel purchase at 1 cent per mile, which means you\u2019re getting a 2% return on all your purchases, which is comparable to the best credit card options on the market.\n\nRedeeming your miles is incredibly easy using the Capital One Venture\u2019s \u201cPurchase Eraser\u201d feature. All you have to do is charge any travel-related purchase to your Venture card, and then go online within 90 days and choose to redeem your miles for that transaction instead of paying for it with cash.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re an expert when it comes to frequent flyer programs, you can also transfer your Capital One miles to 19 different travel partners, including British Airways, Air Canada, Avianca and Wyndham Rewards. You\u2019ll need to do your homework if you go this route, but you can potentially get a lot more value for your miles, which is why frequent flyer website The Points Guy values Capital One miles at 1.85 cents each.\n\nThe following FAQs have been answered by CNN Underscored senior money editor Alberto Riva.\n\nAt CNN Underscored, we evaluate cards based on overall value, not just flashy welcome offers, by focusing on long-term benefits like reward rates, perks and fees. CNN Underscored senior money editor Alberto Riva is a very frequent flyer who covers around 100,000 miles a year in the air and currently holds seven airline credit cards. He\u2019s earned and redeemed vast numbers of air miles and credit card points.

  "summary": "The CNN Underscored reviews financial products based on their overall value and benefits. The best airline credit cards in the US market can be purchased for various types of benefits and future travel, including airline-specific perks. The airline-branded cards typically offer perks with that airline and earn miles in its loyalty program, with a multiplier for each dollar spent on purchases with the carrier. The higher the annual fee, the more valuable the airline-exclusive perks. For those who don't want to earn points that can be redeemed for travel, general travel rewards cards may make more sense. The Chase Sapphire Preferred\u00ae Card earns its place in this list due to its flexibility of Chase Ultimate Rewards points.",
  "shortSummary": "The best airline credit cards, including Chase Sapphire Preferred, offer flexible rewards and benefits with airline-branded cards, but prioritize airline-specific rewards over broader travel benefits and flexibility.",

      "text": "The end of an era is official for Southwest Airlines passengers.\nOn Monday, the airline announced a start date for its new assigned seating, which will bring the airline\u2019s longstanding open-seat boarding tradition to an end.\nFor flights beginning on January 27, 2026, passengers will have options for seat selection at the time of booking, Southwest said in its announcement.\n\u201cOur Customers want more choice and greater control over their travel experience,\u201d said Tony Roach, Southwest executive vice president of customer and brand, in a news release.\n\u201cAssigned seating unlocks new opportunities for our Customers \u2014 including the ability to select Extra Legroom seats \u2014 and removes the uncertainty of not knowing where they will sit in the cabin,\u201d Roach said.\nVarious fare bundles will offer some options for seat selection during booking. Different types of seats \u2014 Extra Legroom, Preferred and Standard \u2014 will also appear as part of those bundles.\nThe assigned-seat era will also usher in a new group-based boarding process.\nExtra Legroom seats will have priority in boarding Groups 1-2.\nPremium fares and loyalty program members and credit cardholders will board earlier in the process. Details are available on the airline\u2019s website.\nThe airline announced its plans to end its free-for-all seating arrangement last summer.\nThe change allows the low-fare carrier to charge a premium for some of the seats on its planes to better compete with legacy carriers American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines. Those airlines generate much of their revenue by charging more for premium seating.\nCNN\u2019s Chris Isidore contributed to this report."
