This allows you to manage it in your personal library, monitor student viewing behavior, embed quiz questions, and more.\nFor more information about migrating YouTube videos in Canvas to Studio content, visit the YouTube Player for Education FAQs resource document.\nLocate Embedded YouTube Video\nIn Canvas, locate the embedded Youtube video you want to migrate.\nTo get the video URL, click the Watch on Youtube button [1] then copy the URL from the web address bar.\nClick the Edit button [2].\nRemove Embedded YouTube Video\nIn the Rich Content Editor, highlight the video and then press the Backspace (PC) or Delete (Mac) key.\nRemove Embedded Video in HTML Editor\nTo remove the embedded video in the HTML editor, click the HTML Editor icon [1].
