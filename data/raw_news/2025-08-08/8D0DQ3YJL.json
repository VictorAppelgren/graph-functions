  "content": "The National Weather Service has issued multiple heat warnings across Washington state, including an extreme heat warning for parts of southwestern Washington and an extreme heat watch for parts of southeastern Washington.\n\nAn extreme heat warning is in effect from noon Sunday, Aug. 10, to 5 a.m. Tuesday, Aug. 12, for the greater Vancouver and Portland metro area, according to the NWS. Temperatures are expected to reach between 97 and 103 degrees with overnight lows hovering from 60 to 70 degrees. The warning also includes the western and central Columbia River Gorge.\n\nAn extreme heat warning means \"dangerous heat conditions\" are expected to occur, and people should prepare to stay hydrated, cool, and out of the sun, the NWS website states.\n\nAn extreme heat watch is in effect from Sunday afternoon, Aug. 10, through Tuesday evening, Aug. 12, for Arlington, Ellensburg, Naches, White Salmon, Ione, Tri-Cities, Connell, Sunnyside, Dayton, Walla Walla, Prosser, Toppenish, Waitsburg, Yakima, and Thorp, according to a NWS bulletin issued Aug. 8.\n\nA heat watch means people should be prepared for \"an extreme heat event\" to possibly take place and plan to stay indoors, according to the NWS.\n\nWeather officials warn of \"dangerously hot conditions\" with possible temperatures between 99 and 103 degrees. These conditions raise the risk of developing heat-related illnesses, and residents should prepare to drink plenty of water, avoid overexposure to the sun, and always double-check cars and trucks for pets and children.\n\nAdditionally, a heat advisory, with possible high temperatures between 93 and 104 degrees, is in effect from noon Sunday, Aug. 10, to 8 p.m. Tuesday, Aug. 12, for the following communities, according to the NWS in Spokane:\n\nA heat advisory isn't as severe as a heat watch, but people should still prepare to stay hydrated and stay out of the sun during the hottest parts of the day, the NWS advised.\n\nAnother heat advisory, with possible temperatures between 92 and 103 degrees, is in effect from noon Monday, Aug. 11, to 8 p.m. Tuesday, Aug. 12, for the following Washington communities, according to the NWS in Spokane:\n\nHow to plan for hot weather\n\nThe NWS recommended that people highly sensitive to heat stay hydrated, keep windows open at night, and wear light clothing.\n\nDuring bouts of severe heat, the Washington State Department of Health recommends staying indoors, drinking plenty of water, and making sure not to leave pets or people in parked cars.\n\nHere are some more heat precautions from the health department:\n\u2022 None Go outside during the cooler parts of the day\n\u2022 None Take a lot of breaks when working outdoors\n\u2022 None Immediately move to a cooler place and rest at the first signs of heat illness\n\nWhat are the signs of heat-related illness?\n\nSome signs of heat-related illness are dizziness, thirst, heavy sweating, nausea, and weakness, according to the NWS.\n\nPeople suffering from heat exhaustion should seek medical help if their symptoms don't improve, the NWS said. Heat exhaustion can lead to heat stroke, including confusion, dizziness, and fainting.\n\nWhat direction should ceiling fans rotate in the summer?\n\nIn summer, ceiling fans should rotate counterclockwise when you look up at them, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. This direction pushes cool air downwards, creating a cooling breeze that helps you feel more comfortable.\n\nIn winter, reverse the direction to clockwise and set to low speed to circulate warm air from the ceiling down to the living spaces.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Kitsap Sun: Extreme heat warning, advisories issued for parts of Washington state",

      "text": "Circulating fans, including ceiling fans, window fans, table fans, floor fans, and fans mounted to poles or walls, create a wind chill effect that makes you feel more comfortable. They can be used alongside natural ventilation or air conditioning to enhance cooling.\nCeiling Fans\nCeiling fans are the most effective type of circulating fan. They help improve comfort year-round by effectively circulating air throughout a room.\n- Summer Use: Run ceiling fans counterclockwise to create a cooling breeze.\n- Winter Use: Reverse the direction to clockwise and set to low speed to circulate warm air from the ceiling down to living spaces.\n- Energy Savings: Using a ceiling fan allows you to raise the thermostat setting by about 4\u00b0F without reducing comfort. In moderate climates, ceiling fans can sometimes replace air conditioning altogether.\nInstallation Tips\n- Ensure ceilings are at least eight feet high.\n- Follow manufacturer instructions for optimal placement and safety.\nSize and Placement\n- Room Size: Use a 36- or 44-inch diameter fan for rooms up to 225 square feet. For larger rooms, use fans 52 inches or more. In rooms longer than 18 feet, multiple fans work best.\n- Blade Size: Larger blades move more air at lower velocities, which is helpful in areas where a strong breeze might disturb loose objects.\nAdditional Tips\n- Check noise ratings and, if possible, test the fan before buying.\n- Look for the ENERGY STAR\u00ae label to ensure efficiency. ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified ceiling fans are up to 60% more efficient than conventional models.\nWindow Fans\nWindow fans are energy-efficient and effective in many climates. They work best when placed in windows facing away from the prevailing wind, exhausting hot air from your home. For more information on cooling your home efficiently, check out our guide on Cooling with Whole House Fans.\nUsage Tips:\n- Close windows near the fan tightly and open windows in rooms far from the fan, preferably on the windward side of your home.\n- Use windows near cooler, shaded outdoor areas for the best intake air.\n- In multi-level homes, place the fan on the upper level and open windows on the lower level, if possible. If not, ventilate each level with separate fans.\nMultiple Fans:\n- Using several window fans together can improve cooling efficiency. For example, fans in multiple upstairs bedrooms can pull air through the entire home, ensuring each bedroom is cooled.\nTake Action\nEnhance your home\u2019s cooling efficiency by utilizing ceiling and window fans. Consult a professional for installation if needed, and always follow manufacturer instructions for optimal performance and safety.

      "text": "During extremely hot and humid weather, your body's ability to cool itself is challenged. When the body heats too rapidly to cool itself properly, or when too much fluid or salt is lost through dehydration or sweating, body temperatures rise and you or someone you care about may experience a heat-related illness. It is important to know the symptoms of extreme heat exposure and the appropriate responses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides a list of warning signs and symptoms of heat illness, and recommended first aid steps. Some of these symptoms and steps are listed below.\nHeat Cramps\nHeat cramps may be the first sign of heat-related illness, and may lead to heat exhaustion or stroke.\nSymptoms: Painful muscle cramps and spasms usually in legs and abdomen. Heavy sweating.\nFirst Aid: Apply firm pressure on cramping muscles or gently massage to relieve spasm. Give sips of water unless the person complains of nausea, then stop giving water.\nSeek immediate medical attention if cramps last longer than 1 hour.\nHeat Exhaustion\nSymptoms: Heavy sweating; weakness or tiredness; cool, pale, clammy skin; fast, weak pulse; muscle cramps; dizziness, nausea or vomiting; headache; fainting.\nFirst Aid: Move person to a cooler environment, preferably a well air-conditioned room. Loosen clothing. Apply cool, wet cloths or have person sit in a cool bath. Offer sips of water.\nSeek immediate medical attention if the person vomits, symptoms worsen or last longer than 1 hour\nHeat Stroke\nSymptoms: Throbbing headache; confusion; slurred speech; nausea; dizziness; body temperature above 103\u00b0F; hot, red, dry or damp skin; rapid and strong pulse; fainting; loss of consciousness.\nFirst Aid:Call 911 or get the victim to a hospital immediately. Heat stroke is a severe medical emergency. Delay can be fatal. Move the victim to a cooler, preferably air-conditioned, environment. Reduce body temperature with cool cloths or bath. Use fan if heat index temperatures are below the high 90s. A fan can make you hotter at higher temperatures. Do NOT give fluids.\nUsing a fan to blow air in someone\u2019s direction may actually make them hotter if heat index temperatures are above the 90s. For more information on all of these heat related illnesses, see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) site."
