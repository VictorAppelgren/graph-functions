      "summary": "Apple faces headwinds from tariffs and lagging AI adoption, while Amazon and Alphabet are positioned to outpace it in market cap by 2028 thanks to strong AWS, AI, and advertising growth. Amazon’s cloud and AI services, along with its expanding advertising revenue, provide a solid trajectory for future value. Alphabet’s dominant search advertising, cloud expansion, and AI integration also set it on a path to surpass Apple’s valuation. Investors are cautioned to monitor potential antitrust risks for Alphabet but overall see both tech giants as likely to eclipse Apple in the coming years.",
