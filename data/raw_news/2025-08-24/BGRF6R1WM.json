  "title": "1 Thing Every Investor Should Know About Dogecoin (DOGE)",
  "description": "How is it possible that Dogecoin still has a valuation over $30 billion?",
  "content": "How is it possible that Dogecoin still has a valuation over $30 billion?\n\nFor the year, meme coin Dogecoin (DOGE -2.26%) is down a dreadful 32%. That's easily the worst performance of any major cryptocurrency. By way of comparison, crypto bellwether Bitcoin (BTC -0.75%) is up 22% for the year, and recently hit an all-time high of $124,000 this summer.\n\nSo, how is it possible that Dogecoin still ranks among the top 10 cryptocurrencies in terms of market cap? And why is it that many investors still consider this meme coin to be a high upside cryptocurrency? The answer might surprise you.\n\nWhen it comes to Dogecoin, the one thing you need to know is that it has a massive circulating coin supply of 150.5 billion. Thus, even though it still trades for a price of less than a quarter ($0.21), it has a market cap of $31.5 billion.\n\nAdmittedly, that's an impressive number, which is why Dogecoin inevitably enters the conversation anytime investors start talking about potential high upside cryptocurrencies. Last year, for example, Dogecoin turned heads when it passed Ford Motor Co. (F 3.44%) and General Mills Inc. (GIS 0.74%) in terms of overall market cap.\n\nBut, at the end of the day, it's just math. A really big number multiplied by any number will still give you a really big number. When you multiply 150.5 billion by $0.21, you get $31.5 billion.\n\nThat's the reason why many new meme coins launch with spectacularly large coin supplies. This is necessary because their intrinsic value is close to zero, so they need coin supplies measured in the trillions (!) in order to move up the market cap ranking charts.\n\nSo, for example, the frog-themed meme coin Pepe (PEPE -3.93%) has a circulating coin supply of 420 trillion. And Shiba Inu (SHIB -2.33%) has a vertigo-inducing coin supply of 589 trillion. Thus, even though the prices of Pepe and Shiba Inu are as close to zero as you can possibly get, they still rank among the top 30 cryptocurrencies in the world.\n\nMaking things even more challenging for Dogecoin, its total lifetime coin supply is uncapped. It is growing over time, and has no final limit on how many coins can ever be created. In contrast, Bitcoin has a maximum lifetime coin supply of 21 million coins. That's hard-coded into the Bitcoin algorithm, and there's no way that anyone can change it. That's music to the ears of investors, who view Bitcoin as a potential safe store of value over time. They don't have to worry about its value being inflated away.\n\nSurely, there must be value somewhere for Dogecoin?\n\nThis is not to say that Dogecoin is completely worthless. Even though it has limited real-world utility, it's possible to argue that it has some sort of intangible value from a marketing and branding perspective.\n\nAll of the brand assets of the iconic DOGE dog avatar, if they were somehow packaged up and sold, would surely be worth something to someone. Billionaire Mark Cuban famously embraced Dogecoin in 2021, when he started to accept it as a form of payment for Dallas Mavericks NBA tickets and merch. But it was really just a marketing and branding play -- it was a way to attract a younger, crypto-savvy audience for basketball games.\n\nThe name DOGE, too, carries some value. Why else would billionaire Elon Musk name an entire government entity (Department of Government Efficiency) after this meme coin? The name \"DOGE\" acts as a dog whistle, suggesting a bit of fun, whimsy, and entertainment. And that, at the end of the day, is what all meme coins are about. There's nothing real supporting them, just an inflated coin supply and a bunch of hype, buzz, and speculation.\n\nIt's hard to recommend any meme coin for a long-term portfolio, and that includes Dogecoin. Consider, for a moment, that in more than a decade, Dogecoin has never, ever, ever traded higher than $1. And that's despite the high-level support of billionaires such as Elon Musk and Mark Cuban!\n\nIf you're looking for a cheap source of entertainment, buying some DOGE for your portfolio might be the answer. But, for now, I'm looking elsewhere for a good time.",

      "text": "The Department of Governmental Efficiency, or DOGE, is an office President Donald Trump established by executive order on day one of his second term that's tasked with cutting government waste and regulations. Trump frequently says that DOGE is led by Tesla (TSLA 6.18%) founder and billionaire Elon Musk, though attorneys for the administration have denied Musk is in charge. In this article, we'll give you an overview of DOGE, its history, and the controversies and legal challenges it faces.\nWhat is it?\nWhat is DOGE?\nDOGE is an office established through an executive order from Trump on the first day of his second term, rather than through an act of Congress like Cabinet agencies. The executive order states that DOGE was created for the purpose of \"modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity.\"\nThe New York Times reported that Musk first floated the idea for DOGE at a Silicon Valley dinner party hosted by tech investor Chamath Palihapitiya for then-Republican presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy. Musk mused that he could drastically reduce federal government bloat if he could get access to government systems and passwords.\nMusk went on to endorse Trump in July 2024 and poured at least $288 million into electing Trump and other GOP candidates. About a month later, Musk mentioned the possibility of a government efficiency commission in an interview with podcaster Lex Fridman.\nInitially, Trump announced the agency would be led by both Musk and Ramaswamy. However, Ramaswamy announced that he would not join DOGE, instead announcing a bid to become Ohio's next governor.\nDOGE was created within an existing agency, the U.S. Digital Service. The acronym \"DOGE\" appears to be a nod to Musk's affection for cryptocurrency Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE).\nThree weeks into the new Trump presidency, TechCrunch reported that Musk's DOGE team had gained \"unprecedented access to a swath of U.S. government departments,\" including the $6 trillion federal payment system. The DOGE team consists mainly of past employees from Musk's businesses, most of whom have little to no government experience and appear to lack the security clearances typically required to access sensitive data.\nTrump has repeatedly said that Musk is running DOGE, but in response to court challenges over the group's actions, administration officials have said the Tesla billionaire is a senior advisor to the president with no official role in DOGE. Administration officials claim Amy Gleason, formerly a health technologist for the U.S. Digital Service, is DOGE's acting administrator. Musk does not draw a salary for whatever his role is in the organization.\nFunding\nHow is DOGE funded?\nProPublica found that DOGE has a budget of at least $40 million, though it's not clear how long that money is intended to last.\nIn an interview with NPR, ProPublica reporter Avi Asher-Shapiro said that \"we don't know if that's the beginning or the end of it. We don't know if it's $40 million a month for the entirety of the initiative, which would be a staggering sum, or if it's $40 million for the entire year. And we don't know if that money is going to salaries, if it's going to equipment, really what it's being spent on.\"\nBecause Congress has not approved funding for DOGE, it appears that federal agencies are directing money to the agency under a law called the Economy Act. Though ProPublica points out that use of the Economy Act should make DOGE subject to the same transparency laws that apply to most other government agencies, DOGE has claimed it operates with executive privileges and refused to respond to Freedom of Information Act requests.\nRelated investing topics\nExamples\nExamples of DOGE in action\nMusk has repeatedly called Social Security a Ponzi scheme and falsely claimed that benefits are fraudulently paid to people who have died and to undocumented immigrants. The Social Security Administration\u2019s Office of the Inspector General estimates that about $72 billion in improper payments were made between 2015 and 2022 -- less than 1% of total benefits paid -- and most were overpayments, which is when someone who's eligible for benefits received more than they should, often due to a change in someone's living situation, marital status, or work status.\nThough Social Security accounts for roughly 21% of the federal budget, less than 1% is spent on administrative expenses, including salaries, in a typical year. However, Musk plans to cut about 7,000 jobs from the Social Security Administration and close six out of 10 field offices. It's expected these cuts will lead to worse customer service, which has long been a struggle for the SSA.\nOf particular concern is the potential for longer wait times when it comes to processing Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) applications. The average person currently waits about 240 days hear back on a decision about their SSDI application, up from 120 days before the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Axios. Experts believe that slashing Social Security's workforce could add months, or even years, to the wait time."

      "text": "Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE) is a cryptocurrency that was originally created as a joke in 2013. Its origins goes back to the Doge meme that featured a Shiba Inu dog. Dogecoin is an open-source, peer-to-peer digital currency. Like other cryptocurrencies, it runs on blockchain technology.\nWhat is it?\nWhat is Dogecoin?\nDogecoin is a cryptocurrency known for its robust and loyal online community, known as the \"Doge Army.\" Dogecoin uses the Scrypt algorithm, a proof-of-work algorithm that's used to secure transactions and improve storage efficiency.\nDogecoin is also classified as an altcoin, which is a term used to refer to a cryptocurrency that's not Bitcoin (BTC -0.7%). Because Dogecoin has an unlimited supply, long-term price stability is extremely difficult. The more tokens that are created, the lower the price of those tokens go. Dogecoin can be purchased on most crypto exchanges.\nHistory\nThe history of Dogecoin\nDogecoin was created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer in December 2013 using open-source code. Markus was a software developer at IBM and Palmer was a product manager at Adobe.\nDogecoin was forked from Litecoin (LTC -1.39%). In cryptocurrency, a fork is when the blockchain's code is updated or split into two separate chains. Forks can be used to add new features or create new cryptocurrencies, the latter of which was how Dogecoin came to be.\nWhile Dogecoin originated as a satirical response to the cryptocurrency hype, it witnessed a price increase of more than 300% in its early days. Then in 2021, Dogecoin hit an all-time high around $0.73 a share on the back of social media buzz from both retail and prominent investors.\nHow it works\nHow does Dogecoin work?\nDogecoin operates on blockchain technology, where transactions are recorded on a decentralized public ledger maintained by a network of computers. This allows users to send and receive Dogecoin securely without the need for a central authority. New Dogecoins are created through mining, a process that involves solving complex math equations to validate transactions on the Dogecoin blockchain.\nThe fastest miner to confirm a transaction receives the mining reward of 10,000 Dogecoins per block. Cryptocurrency mining is the process of using computers to generate new coins and verify transactions on a blockchain network. Miners are then rewarded with cryptocurrency for their work.\nDogecoin relies on the proof-of-work algorithm to verify transactions, where miners compete to solve complex computational puzzles to validate transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. Mining Dogecoin requires specialized hardware like graphics processing units (GPUs) with high computational power.\nUsers store their Dogecoin in digital wallets, which are essentially private keys that allow them to access and manage their funds. When a user wants to send Dogecoin, they initiate a transaction by providing the recipient's public address. The transaction is broadcast to the network and verified by miners. The transaction is then added to the blockchain, and the recipient receives the Dogecoin.\nRelated investing topics\nUse cases\nDogecoin use cases\nDogecoin can be used for tipping, online transactions, and even charitable donations. The token has also become a popular way to tip content creators on social media platforms like Reddit (RDDT -0.61%).\nSome online retailers accept Dogecoin as payment, while a handful of companies allow customers to even pay bills and utilities using the crypto. Dogecoin has low transaction fees and fast payment processing times, which makes it a good option for some businesses who want to tap into the crypto\u2019s large community of supporters.\nUnlike many other cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin has no maximum cap on the number of coins that can be created. For example, Bitcoin has a finite supply of 21 million coins. New Dogecoins can be mined indefinitely, with roughly 10,000 new coins being generated every minute, resulting in a constantly growing supply.\nThese factors, plus the limited uses around the coin that still derives most of its value from hype, mean Dogecoin is a volatile, high-risk investment. Potential investors should bear these factors in mind before putting cash to work in this token."

      "text": "Meme coins have carved out a peculiar niche in the cryptocurrency market. Some blockchain networks don't have much of a business plan or long-term plans for usability in the real world. Instead, they sidestep traditional financial valuations almost entirely, deriving value from market messages or outright jokes.\nUnderstanding meme coins\nUnderstanding meme coins\nMeme coins are cryptocurrencies that originate from internet memes or have a humorous or viral aspect. Unlike Bitcoin (BTC -0.7%) or Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH), which are backed by robust blockchain technologies and have clear utility in digital transactions and decentralized applications (dApps), meme coins often lack a specific purpose beyond the community and cultural value they hold.\nBlockchain\nThe first and most famous example, Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE), was created as a joke in 2013 but has since gained significant popularity and market capitalization. It is based on the same blockchain code that runs the larger, more sincere Bitcoin cryptocurrency but with technical tweaks that make it less useful for real-world payments and storage of monetary value.\nMany newer meme coins don't run their own blockchain networks at all. Rather, they function as tokens supported by existing cryptosystems, such as Ethereum or Solana (CRYPTO:SOL).\nThis strategy makes it even easier to create a new token with a suitably silly marketing message wrapped in the data security and transaction efficiency of the underlying parent network. The technical details can be somebody else's problem.\nWhy meme coins matter\nWhy meme coins matter\nMeme coins spotlight the power of community and sentiment in the digital age. Their value is largely driven by social media, celebrity endorsements, and the broader meme culture that thrives on the internet.\nThis phenomenon underscores a shift in how value is perceived and created in the cryptocurrency space. While traditional assets are evaluated based on fundamentals or utility, meme coins thrive on collective belief and the communal desire to be part of a shared (but speculative) financial journey.\nIt doesn't hurt if your favorite project has a cute mascot, a funny name, or a controversial philosophy. Well-known celebrity backers with millions of social media followers can make a big difference, too. The most popular meme coins often have all of these headline-inspiring qualities.\nMeme coins also serve as an entry point into the cryptocurrency world for many investors. They frequently come with very low dollar-based prices, often paired with viral stories of dramatic gains in the early going. These qualities can attract a whole new demographic of investors looking not just for profits but also for participation in a cultural movement.\nThis idea has important implications for understanding market dynamics, where narrative and hype can significantly influence digital asset prices. One social media post from the right influencer can send a meme coin skyrocketing in a hurry -- or pop a meme coin's inflated valuation just as quickly.\nHave a meme coin? Now what?\nSo, you've got a meme coin on your hands. Now what?\nVenturing into the world of meme coins is like stepping onto a roller coaster with your investment portfolio in tow. Can it be exciting? Absolutely. Is this thrill ride predictable? Not in the slightest. But you should be fine as long as you know what you're getting into. So, here's how you should strap in for the meme coin ride.\nDo your research\nJust like you wouldn't buy a car based solely on its color, diving into meme coins requires a peek under the hood. What's powering its popularity? Is the engine (community support and social media buzz) robust enough to sustain a long journey, or is it running on mere fumes?\nManage your risks\nInvesting in meme coins should be like placing a side bet in an unpredictable casino game rather than betting the farm on a so-called \"sure thing.\" Cryptocurrencies should comprise a moderate portion of your properly diversified investment portfolio, and meme coins can occupy a small sliver of the larger crypto collection.\nMake sure you're comfortable with seeing your meme coin values fluctuate wildly -- sometimes in the blink of an eye and not always for any obvious reason.\nStay informed\nThe meme coin market is as dynamic as a chat room meme war. It pays to keep abreast of trends, news, and shifts in sentiment that can turn today's laughing stock into tomorrow's golden goose -- or vice versa.\nA Dogecoin example\nLet's check out Dogecoin, for example\nPerhaps the epitome of meme coin success, Dogecoin began as a lighthearted parody of Bitcoin but quickly grew into a symbol of the crypto community's playful side. Despite its lighthearted origins, Dogecoin has seen substantial price increases from time to time, usually fueled by social media buzz and endorsements from influential figures like Tesla (TSLA 6.18%) CEO Elon Musk.\nIts journey from a pure meme to a solid staple of the crypto market highlights the unpredictable nature of meme coins and their potential for unexpected success. Dogecoin's rise underscores the importance of community in the crypto market, a factor that can turn a simple joke into a billion-dollar asset.\nThe ride down to smaller market caps can be just as quick and unexpected when the early backers stop promoting the meme coin on social media channels. In the cryptocurrency sector, value is not only defined by utility but also by the shared belief and enthusiasm of its holders.\nRelated investing topics\nPerception often becomes reality, for better or worse. Giants like Bitcoin are not immune to this volatility-boosting effect, but meme coins like Dogecoin are always exposed to these unpredictable winds of change. Some go beyond simple jokes and prove to be outright scams in the long run.\nSo, be careful with those adorable meme coins and watch out for pump-and-dump schemes known as \"rug pulls\" in the crypto world."

Initially created as a joke based on the \"Doge\" meme featuring a Shiba Inu named Kabosu, it quickly grew in popularity. Dogecoin runs on a decentralised blockchain, using Proof-of-Work (PoW) and the Scrypt algorithm, making it less energy-intensive than Bitcoin. Its key uses include tipping content creators, donations, and payments for goods and services. The community is known for its charitable initiatives, such as supporting the Jamaican bobsled team and clean water projects. Despite its humorous origins, Dogecoin has developed a strong community and growing ecosystem, with ongoing development by the Dogecoin Core team and governance provided by the Dogecoin Foundation. There is no maximum supply, and miners earn 10,000 DOGE per minute, encouraging frequent usage rather than holding. Dogecoin remains a unique digital asset with widespread community support.\nNews & Analysis\n1 Thing Every Investor Should Know About Dogecoin (DOGE)\nHow is it possible that Dogecoin still has a valuation over $30 billion?\nIf You'd Invested $1,000 In Dogecoin 5 Years Ago, Here's How Much You'd Have Today\nDogecoin is the original meme token and still very popular today.\nGot $2,500?

      "text": "Elon Musk is, by many metrics, the most successful entrepreneur of modern times. He had a net worth of $394 billion as of June 2025, making him the richest person in the world. Near the end of 2024, he was worth a record $486 billion before Tesla (TSLA 6.18%) stock fell.\nA natural question among investors is where Musk chooses to invest his money. Let's take a look at Elon Musk's investments (and the businesses he starts and acquires), the type of investments he avoids, and what you should know about his strategy.\nHis strategy\nElon Musk's investment strategy\nElon Musk's investment strategy is rather simple, at least as far as he's made public. His investments can be divided into two general categories: companies he started or controls and cryptocurrencies. Unlike many other billionaires, Musk doesn't have a large portfolio of publicly traded stocks of companies where he doesn't have day-to-day involvement.\nEven when Musk took a 9.2% stake in social media platform Twitter in April 2022, his ultimate goal was to buy the company and take it private. He rejected a seat on Twitter's board of directors for that reason. After ample back-and-forth, the deal went through in late October 2022, with Musk buying Twitter for $44 billion. He rebranded Twitter as X in 2023.\nMusk's investments are highly concentrated in his entrepreneurial endeavors. The first category comprises publicly traded stock investments, and the second includes private companies that he founded and in which he continues to hold an investment. With that in mind, here's a breakdown of what we know about Musk's investments.\nPublicly Traded Company\nPublic holdings\nElon Musk's publicly traded stock investments\nThe largest publicly traded stock holding for Elon Musk is electric vehicle giant Tesla. Musk was an early investor, having led the Series A funding round, and he was one of the company's first employees. Musk accumulated a majority stake and took control of the company in 2008.\nAs of June 2025, Musk owned about 12.8% of Tesla, valued at over $100 billion. He also has a compensation package from Tesla that pays him exclusively in company stock through performance-based tranches of stock options, so his ownership has increased over time.\nDuring the dot-com boom era, Musk was a co-founder of the original X.com, which ultimately became PayPal (PYPL 3.43%). He was CEO of PayPal until 2000 and owned 11.7% of the company's shares at one point. He no longer has a stake in PayPal, although he owned shares before the company was acquired by eBay (EBAY 0.36%) in 2002.\nHe received more than $100 million for his stake after cashing out. Today, Musk's PayPal stake would be worth billions of dollars. However, since he used the proceeds to fund both Tesla and SpaceX in their early days, it's tough to make the case that cashing out was a bad move.\nPrivate equity\nElon Musk's private equity\nMusk founded and still controls several companies, but SpaceX is, by far, the largest. He owns about 42% of the space exploration technology company, which was valued at roughly $350 billion as of the fourth quarter of 2024.\nPrivate Equity\nIn addition to SpaceX, Musk has majority ownership of several other privately owned start-ups he founded or co-founded, most notably:\nCryptocurrency\nElon Musk's cryptocurrency investments\nAlthough we don't know the exact amounts he owns, we do know that Musk is a cryptocurrency investor, both through the companies he controls and personally. He has been quite outspoken about some of his favorite digital assets, particularly Dogecoin (CRYPTO:DOGE).\nMusk has also revealed that he owns Bitcoin (BTC -0.7%) and Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH) and has stated that his Bitcoin is worth much more than his Ethereum or Dogecoin.\nTesla and SpaceX both own significant amounts of Bitcoin, too. Although we know Tesla owned 11,509 Bitcoins as of March 2025 (worth more than $1 billion at the time), we don't know how much of any cryptocurrencies Musk personally owns.\nWhat he doesn't buy\nStocks Elon Musk doesn't buy\nWhile we don't know every single detail about Musk's investment portfolio, we do know that the bulk of his stock holdings are in both public and private companies he controls. He doesn't own any well-known stock positions in other businesses. In 2021, he said, \"The only significant thing I hold outside of Tesla is SpaceX.\"\nMusk isn't a hedge fund manager and isn't required to disclose relatively small investments. It's entirely possible that he has small investments in publicly traded stocks that we don't know about. But all indications are that he primarily invests in his own companies.\nInvesting like Elon\nHow you can invest like Elon Musk\nIf you want to invest like Elon Musk, the first thing you should do is buy shares of Tesla stock since it makes up the vast majority of the billionaire's net worth. However, the private equity side of his portfolio is harder to emulate.\nYou can't simply buy shares of SpaceX or The Boring Company on the public market, and most people are unable to participate in funding rounds for those businesses. The next best thing you can do is find publicly traded companies with a similar focus. For example, many investors have called Rocket Lab (RKLB 6.75%) the closest thing to SpaceX on the public markets.\nRelated investing topics\nIf you want to follow Musk's approach with cryptocurrencies, that's easy enough, since he's only known to hold Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. However, just because a rich and/or famous investor buys a cryptocurrency doesn't mean you should put your own money in it. Do your own research on each coin first, and don't commit too much of your portfolio to crypto due to the risk involved.\nThe bottom line is that although Elon Musk is very wealthy, most of his net worth is tied up in a single stock (Tesla) and private companies that you or I likely cannot invest in. Besides buying Tesla stock, if you want to invest like Elon Musk, becoming an entrepreneur might be the best way to go about emulating his style.\nFAQ\nElon Musk investment strategy FAQ\nWhat crypto is Elon Musk investing in?\nElon Musk has stated that he owns Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. He may own other cryptocurrencies as well, but those are the three he has confirmed publicly.\nWhat AI company is Elon Musk investing in?\nElon Musk founded his own AI company, xAI, in 2023. He invested more than $44 million in OpenAI from 2016 to 2020.\nWhat is Elon Musk's biggest source of income?\nElon Musk's biggest source of income is his ownership stake and role as CEO at Tesla. He owns about 12.8% of Tesla's outstanding shares as of June 2025, and as CEO, he's awarded stock options if the company reaches performance and valuation milestones.\nWhat are Elon Musk's largest holdings?\nElon Musk's largest holdings are his ownership stakes in Tesla and SpaceX."

The meme\u2011coin\u2019s value is driven by community sentiment and marketing rather than real-world use, a pattern common to many meme tokens such as Pepe and Shiba Inu. In a separate story, the Trump administration created a \u201cDOGE\u201d office for government efficiency, reportedly led by Elon Musk, but the agency has faced questions over funding, transparency, and its actual role. Dogecoin itself began as a joke in 2013, grew through social media buzz, and remains a cultural phenomenon rather than a stable investment. Elon Musk\u2019s investment focus is concentrated on his own companies and a handful of cryptocurrencies, with Dogecoin being one of the few crypto assets he publicly supports.",
