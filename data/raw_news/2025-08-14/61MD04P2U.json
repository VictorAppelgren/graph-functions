  "description": "The conservative activist said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has been receptive to her concerns.",
  "content": "The Pentagon first publicly backed Army Secretary Dan Driscoll on Thursday, almost a week after MAGA influencer Lara Loomer accused him of \"promoting anti-Trump Leftists\" on social media.\n\nLoomer, who has made a name out of questioning officials\u2019 loyalty to President Donald Trump, launched a broadside this month against Driscoll and Medal of Honor recipient Florent Groberg, a retired Army officer who was injured when he tackled a suicide bomber approaching his unit in Afghanistan.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth \u201chas absolute confidence in Secretary Driscoll,\u201d Pentagon spokesperson Kingsley Wilson told reporters Thursday, six days after Loomer attackedthe service leader for speaking with Eugene Vindman, a former Army officer and current House Democrat from Virginia, who played a key role in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial.\n\nHe also \u201cstands by every single Medal of Honor recipient,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThey are all heroes in our eyes and that includes Flo Groberg.\u201d\n\nHegseth, who is prolific on both his personal and official X accounts, has not commented about Loomer\u2019s posts.\n\nLoomer, in an interview this week before the Pentagon comments, said she and Hegseth had spoken, but would not say whether the conversation involved Driscoll.\n\n\u201cI'm not telling Pete Hegseth how to do his job,\u201d Loomer said. \u201cHe's a good leader in the sense that he's not just ignoring [issues I raise] and saying, \u2018Oh, well, it doesn't matter.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe conservative activist, in her rant against Driscoll, also complained that he hired former Biden cyber policy official Jen Easterly for a part-time teaching position. Easterly is a West Point graduate who served in uniform for two decades. The Army secretary isn\u2019t normally consulted on hiring decisions at West Point, but Driscoll ordered the offer rescinded after a previous Loomer post and called for a review of how appointments at the academy are made.\n\nShe also lashed out at Groberg \u2014 who was honored by the Army\u2019s social media account for his heroism \u2014 for being \u201can immigrant who voted for Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nLoomer didn\u2019t back down from her criticism of Driscoll, an Army combat vet and longtime Republican. \u201cWhen is this guy going to realize that he doesn't have the political acumen or the political knowledge of the MAGA movement?\u201d she said in the interview, adding she wasn\u2019t trying to get him fired.\n\nShe also suggested Driscoll\u2019s close friendship with Vice President JD Vance, who know each other from their time at Yale Law School, has helped deflect some criticism.\n\n\u201cIs being friends with the vice president a qualification in today's world?\u201d she said. \u201cI personally thought that there would be a higher bar aside from just being really good friends with the vice president.\u201d\n\nThe Defense Department\u2019s support came too late from some in the Pentagon, who were frustrated that leaders didn\u2019t defend the combat heroes more quickly.\n\n\u201cA medal of honor recipient shouldn\u2019t need defending, but leadership has let this slide,\u201d said a defense official, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly.\n\nThe Pentagon, when asked for comment, wouldn\u2019t say whether Hegseth agreed with Loomer\u2019s criticisms.\n\n\u201cSecretary Hegseth appreciates Ms. Loomer's outside public advocacy,\u201d Pentagon spokesperson Joel Valdez said. \u201cHe has total confidence in Army Secretary Driscoll.\u201d",
