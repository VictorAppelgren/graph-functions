      "feedback": "Strong fundamentals for a world‑class near‑term piece are present (Krugman’s stagflation warning tied to tariff/deportation policies, the Intel stake episode, and the large White House investment list as policy‑signal context, plus Lagarde on central‑bank independence and the Vegas discretionary‑demand cue). However, the analysis is still too narrative and under‑specified for 0–3 weeks: it should present a tight, three‑part playbook with explicit thresholds, catalysts, and a unified transmission story grounded in the cited sources. Concrete edits I’d make in one pass:\n- Reframe into a crisp 0–3 week structure: (a) Immediate drivers (policy signals, e.g., Trump tariff/deportation stance and the 10% Intel stake with $8.7B price tag from 218AGGUXB; Lagarde’s independence emphasis from U6HXAJR4J), (b) Near‑term catalysts (inflation/growth data prints, AI investment momentum versus policy risk as per 218AGGUXB and WH list from 3; and the AC‑cost impulse from LLN6N4H3Z), and (c) Expected reaction function (risk premia moves in cyclical sectors, asset‑price sensitivity to credibility, and potential counter‑weight from AI‑led productivity). Explicitly state how equities, bonds, and currencies are likely to respond to each catalyst. \n- Put concrete levels/thresholds and invalidation criteria: e.g., inflation prints exceeding a near‑term threshold (drawn from LLN6N4H3Z’s $1,500 retrofit/price impulse) would push pricing toward higher policy expectations; a break in the Intel stake controversy or credible Fed/ECB communication (Lagarde) would lessen risk premia; invalidate the base case if AI investment pledges slow materially (cite WH list magnitudes as ceiling), or if official data show consumers and services inflation accelerating beyond a Krugman‑consistent shock pathway (218AGGUXB). \n- Strengthen channels with explicit source‑linked logic: tariff/deportation shock to input costs and pricing power (218AGGUXB); AI investment as productivity/deflation shield if policy stays supportive (218AGGUXB); central‑bank independence credibility as a stabilizer against policy noise (U6HXAJR4J); consumer balance sheets and auto credit sensitivity (CDBMWIUTB); discretionary demand/shock signals from Vegas‑style service pricing as a proxy for real‑world demand (6OOEK8TUR). \n- Quantify with exact numbers from sources: quote the Intel stake ($8.7B, 10% stake) and related critique (218AGGUXB); quote LLN6N4H3Z’s $1,500 average AC cost increase and $13k–$14k replacement price; reference the Apple/ Nvidia/TSMC scale in the WH list (e.g., Apple $600B, Nvidia $500B, TSMC $100B, etc.) to illustrate the policy‑signal intensity; and cite Lagarde/Powell dynamics for credibility context (U6HXAJR4J). \n- Tighten inference and avoid generic platitudes: label alternative hypotheses (inflation entrenchment vs. non‑entrenchment; AI boom persistence vs. bust; policy independence vs. intervention) with explicit triggers and probability qualifiers. \n- Ensure discipline on citations: every causal claim or signal must explicitly map to one of the IDs above (218AGGUXB, LLN6N4H3Z, CDBMWIUTB, U6HXAJR4J, 6OOEK8TUR, 3/White House list), and clearly reconcile any tensions (e.g., Krugman vs. Cuban on inflation, Lagarde vs. Powell on independence). \nIf you implement these edits, you’ll produce a 0–3 week, scenario‑based, quantitatively anchored piece with explicit level thresholds, catalysts, invalidation rules, and a clean transmission chain that matches SECTION FOCUS.",
