  "description": "Health officials are alerting hundreds of people who may have been exposed to rabies in bat-infested cabins at Wyoming's Grand Teton National Park.",
  "content": "Health officials are working to alert hundreds of people in dozens of states and several countries who may have been exposed to rabies in bat-infested cabins in Wyoming\u2019s Grand Teton National Park over the past few months.\n\nAs of Friday, none of the bats found in some of the eight linked cabins at Jackson Lake Lodge had tested positive for rabies.\n\nBut the handful of dead bats found and sent to the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory in Laramie for testing were probably only a small sample of the likely dozens that colonized the attic above the row of cabins, Wyoming State Health Officer Dr. Alexia Harrist said.\n\nOther bats weren\u2019t killed but got shooed out through cabin doors and windows. Meanwhile, the vast majority never flapped down from the attic into living spaces.\n\nHealth officials thus deemed it better safe than sorry to alert everybody who has stayed in the cabins recently that they might have been exposed by being bitten or scratched. Especially when people are sleeping, a bat bite or scratch can go unseen and unnoticed.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re really concerned about is people who saw bats in their rooms and people who might have had direct contact with a bat,\u201d Harrist said Friday.\n\nThe cabins have been unoccupied, with no plans to reopen, since concessionaire Grand Teton Lodge Company discovered the bat problem July 27.\n\nBats are a frequent vector of the rabies virus. Once symptoms occur \u2014 muscle aches, vomiting, itching, to name a few \u2014 rabies is almost always fatal in humans.\n\nThe good news is a five-shot prophylactic regimen over a two-week period soon after exposure is highly effective in preventing illness, Harrist noted.\n\nThe cabins opened for the summer season in May after being vacant over the winter. Based on the roughly 250 reservations through late July, health officials estimated that up to 500 people had stayed in the cabins.\n\nThey were trying to reach people in 38 states and seven countries through those states\u2019 health agencies and, in the case of foreign visitors, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOthers who have not been alerted yet but stayed in cabins 516, 518, 520, 522, 524, 526, 528 and 530 this year should tell health officials or a doctor immediately, Harrist said.\n\nHealth officials were recommending prophylactic shots for people who fit certain criteria, such as deep sleepers who found a bat in their room, and children too young to say that they had seen a bat.\n\nThe Wyoming Department of Health had no ongoing concern about visitor safety at the Jackson Lake Lodge area. That includes a Federal Reserve economic policy symposium Aug. 21-23 that takes place at Jackson Lake Lodge every summer.\n\n\u201cThe lodge company has done a fantastic job of doing their due diligence of making sure everyone that is coming in for that, and for all other visits this year, are going to be as safe as possible,\u201d said Emily Curren, Wyoming\u2019s public health veterinarian.\n\n\u201cThree or four\u201d dead bats from the cabins tested negative and one that was mangled did not have enough brain tissue to be testable, Curren said.\n\nAll were brown bats, which come in two species: \u201clittle\u201d and \u201cbig,\u201d with the larger ones more than twice as big. Officials were unsure which species these were, but both are common in Wyoming.\n\nThey typically live in colonies of 30 to 100 individuals, Curren said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of bats that we cannot rule out a risk of rabies being in,\u201d Curren said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way for us to know for certain about every single bat that got into these rooms.\u201d\n\nThere are no plans to exterminate the bats, Grand Teton National Park spokesperson Emily Davis said. Devices fitted to the building were keeping the bats from getting back in after flying out in pursuit of insects to eat, they said.",

      "text": "Inflation or jobs: Federal Reserve officials are divided over competing concerns\nInflation or jobs: Federal Reserve officials are divided over competing concerns\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 One major question will be front and center for Federal Reserve policymakers as they prepare for an annual conference in Jackson, Wyoming next week and a crucial policy meeting in September: Which is a bigger problem for the economy right now, stubborn inflation or slower hiring?\nWeak job gains since April have pushed some officials toward supporting a cut in the Fed\u2019s key rate as soon as next month, but speeches and comments by other Fed policymakers show that inflation is still a concern.\nThat could make the Fed\u2019s ultimate move at its September 16-17 meeting a close call. There will be another jobs report and another inflation report before then, and both will likely heavily influence the decision of whether to cut or not. The uncertainty also means that Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s speech next Friday in Jackson will be closely watched for any clues about next steps.\nIf Fed officials worry more that unemployment will start to rise and the economy falter, they are more likely to reduce their rate in order lower borrowing costs and spur borrowing and spending. Yet if their concerns grow that inflation will stay high or worsen as tariffs ripple across global supply chains, they will lean more towards keeping borrowing costs high to cool the economy and lower prices. The rate currently stands at 4.3%.\nWall Street investors are pretty certain \u2014 for now \u2014 that the central bank will reduce rates in September, with futures prices putting the odds of a cut at 93%, according to CME Fedwatch.\nThose odds jumped after the monthly jobs report Aug. 1 showed that hiring was sluggish in July and was much lower than previously estimated in May and June. Average job gains over those three months fell to just 35,000, down from 123,000 a year ago.\nAnd Tuesday\u2019s inflation report, which showed only a mild pickup in inflation at the consumer level and limited signs that tariffs were pushing goods prices higher, underscored the view of some officials that they could put inflation concerns aside and focus on shoring up the job market instead.\n\u201cWith underlying inflation on a sustained trajectory toward 2%, softness in aggregate demand, and signs of fragility in the labor market, I think that we should focus on risks to our employment mandate,\u201d Michelle Bowman, a member of the Fed\u2019s governing board, said last week.\nYet Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Chicago branch, downplayed the weakness in hiring in remarks to reporters Wednesday. The slowdown in job gains could partly reflect the drop in immigration stemming from President Donald Trump\u2019s border crackdown, Goolsbee said, rather than a weaker economy. He also pointed to the still-low unemployment rate of 4.2% as evidence that the job market is solid.\nThis week\u2019s inflation report included some warning signs, Goolsbee added: Prices of many services that aren\u2019t affected by tariffs, such as dental care and air fares, jumped, a sign that inflation may not be in check.\n\u201cThat was the most concerning thing in the inflation report, and if that persisted, we would have a hard time getting back to 2%,\u201d Goolsbee said, referring to the central bank\u2019s inflation goal. \u201cI am still hopeful that will not be a lasting problem.\u201d\nFed officials also disagree on how tariffs will affect inflation going forward. Many increasingly believe the duties will result in simply a one-time boost to prices that will quickly fade and not lead to ongoing inflation.\n\u201cTariffs will boost inflation in the near term, but likely not in a persistent way\u201d that would require the Fed to keep rates elevated, Mary Daly, president of the Fed\u2019s San Francisco branch, said in a recent speech.\nDaly also said the labor market has \u201csoftened\u201d and suggested the Fed \u201cwill likely need to adjust policy in the coming months.\u201d\nHowever, Raphael Bostic, president of the Fed\u2019s Atlanta branch, said Wednesday that the tariffs could lead to longer-term inflation if they cause more manufacturers to shift output from lower-cost locations overseas back to the United States, or to other countries with higher wages. Such a change would be more than just a one-time shift.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see fundamental structural changes if this is successful,\u201d Bostic said in remarks in Red Bay, Alabama. \u201cIt is actually a different economy.\u201d\nIn that scenario, Bostic said, he would prefer to wait \u201cuntil we have a little more clarity.\u201d And he added that with unemployment low, \u201cwe have the luxury to do that.\u201d\nThursday\u2019s July wholesale price report, which showed a sharp jump in goods and services prices before they reach the consumer, did make one move less likely: A half-point cut in September, as suggested by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.\nAlberto Musalem, president of the Fed\u2019s St. Louis branch, who votes on Fed policy this year, said that a reduction of that size is \u201cunsupported by the current state of the economy, and the outlook for the economy,\u201d in an interview on CNBC.\nTim Duy, an economist at SGH Macro, said Thursday that the Fed may have to raise its inflation forecast at its September meeting when it provides its latest set of quarterly economic projections. The central bank\u2019s policymakers currently expect inflation, excluding volatile food and energy, to reach 3.1% by the end of this year, yet inflation is already near that level.\nCutting rates at the September meeting would be hard for the Fed if it is also forecasting higher inflation, Duy said.\n\u201cThere are things that could happen that would push the Fed off the path\u201d toward a rate cut, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not paying adequate attention to those risks.\u201d"

      "text": "Arizona, Nevada and Mexico will again get less Colorado River water in 2026\nDENVER (AP) \u2014 Arizona, Nevada and Mexico will again live with less water from the Colorado River as drought lingers in the West, federal officials announced Friday.\nThe Colorado River is a critical lifeline to seven U.S. states, 30 Native American tribes, and two Mexican states. The cuts are based on projections for levels at federal reservoirs \u2014 chief among them Lake Powell and Lake Mead \u2014 released every August by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.\nArizona will again go without 18% of its total Colorado River allocation, while Mexico loses 5%. The reduction for Nevada \u2014 which receives far less water than Arizona, California or Mexico \u2014 will stay at 7%. California won\u2019t face any cuts because it has senior water rights and is the last to lose in times of shortage.\nDecades of overuse and the effects of long-term drought worsened by climate change means there\u2019s far more demand for water than what actually flows through the river. Low reservoir levels at Lake Mead have triggered mandatory cutbacks every year since 2022, with the deepest cuts in 2023, which hit farmers in Arizona the hardest.\nMeanwhile, the states are working to reach agreement by next year on new long-term rules to govern the river in dry years. The Trump administration gave a mid-November deadline for states to reach a preliminary agreement, or risk federal intervention. Negotiations have faced delays as states push back against how much water they should each give up.\nThe original 1922 Colorado River Compact was calculated based on an amount of water that doesn\u2019t exist in today\u2019s climate. That leaves the Upper Basin states of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and Utah to share far less water after the required amount is sent to the to the \u201cLower Basin\u201d states of Nevada, Arizona and California. Lots of water is also lost to evaporation and leaky infrastructure.\nFairly splitting the river\u2019s water in the era of climate change has been vexing for years, with all of the major users hesitant to give anything up as they anticipate a drier future. There has to be enough water in the reservoirs to reach the tunnels that usher water downstream, and ideally, even more water for hydropower generation. Key infrastructure like the Hoover Dam rely on certain water levels in Lake Mead to generate electricity.\nMandatory cuts and emergency water releases are \u201creactive,\u201d said John Berggren, a regional policy manager at Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit focused on climate change.\n\u201cIf we are going to be able to have a sustainable Colorado River and not just be responding to crisis after crisis, we need large amounts of flexibility built into this new set of guidelines,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe can and must do better. Nature isn\u2019t waiting for us,\u201d said Becky Mitchell, Colorado\u2019s commissioner in the Upper Colorado River Commission.\nStates are considering a so-called natural flow approach to managing the river \u2014 where the Lower Basin would receive a certain percentage of the average natural flow from the prior few years.\nThe Lower Basin states have helped stave off deeper cuts by coming up with voluntary conservation plans.\n\u201cAbsent all of those measures, the river would be in a very bad place,\u201d said J.B. Hamby, chairman of the Colorado River Board of California and a board member for the Imperial Irrigation District, the largest user of the river\u2019s water. Still, he knows California, like others, will likely have to give up more in the negotiations.\nDozens of conservation projects along for Upper Basin states and tribes are in limbo. President Donald Trump froze yet-to-be-distributed Inflation Reduction Act funds on his first day in office, which included nearly $400 million for those projects. The entire Colorado congressional delegation signed a letter earlier this month urging the release their portion of those funds.\n___\nThis story has been corrected to remove a reference to the third year of cuts in the headline. The cuts announced Friday are set for 2026, which will be the fifth year. ___\nAssociated Press journalists Amy Taxin in Tustin, California, and Mead Gruver in Fort Collins, Colorado, contributed to this report.\n___\nThe Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

      "text": "Boise State again favored to win Mountain West as conference prepares for major changes\nBoise State again favored to win Mountain West as conference prepares for major changes\nChange is coming to the Mountain West, but this season will feel like so many others.\nNo. 25 Boise State was picked to win the conference.\nFor the 15th year in a row.\nBroncos coach Spencer Danielson pointed out that didn\u2019t equate to a conference title every time, but Boise State is the two-time defending champion. The program lost Heisman Trophy runner-up Ashton Jeanty and still received 35 of 39 first-place votes from the media.\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the culture that we have,\u201d said left tackle Kage Casey, a potential first-round pick in next year\u2019s NFL draft. \u201cEveryone in the conference knows that we\u2019re putting in the work to be the best, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to show game by game, day by day.\u201d\nBoise State and four other schools \u2014 Colorado State, Fresno State, San Diego State and Utah State \u2014 will be playing their final season in the Mountain West. Those five will depart for the Pac-12 Conference in what has been a contentious divorce that saw UNLV turn down overtures from the Pac-12 to remain in the Mountain West.\nThe Rebels made the championship game the past two seasons before falling short against Boise State, and they were picked to finish second again this year. With first-year coach Dan Mullen, who previously coached Florida and Mississippi State, there is great optimism at UNLV of taking the next step and perhaps qualifying for the College Football Playoff.\nJunior safety Jake Pope was recruited by Mullen coming out of high school in 2022, but chose Alabama over the Gators. He transferred to Georgia two years later and then to UNLV.\n\u201cA really, really great players\u2019 coach,\u201d Pope said. \u201cHe\u2019s always down to listen to what we have, positive and negative. ... It\u2019s pretty cool to be back here with him.\u201d\nMoving on from Jeanty\nJeanty had a season for the ages last year, leading the nation with 2,601 yards and 29 touchdowns rushing. He fell just 27 yards short of Barry Sanders\u2019 NCAA record.\nIt might take a committee to come close to making up such production.\nRedshirt freshman Sire Gaines is back after missing nearly all of last season with an injury; in last year\u2019s opener against Georgia Southern, he rushed for 110 yards and a touchdown on 12 carries. Malik Sherrod is a sixth-year transfer from Fresno State who also had his season ended prematurely by injury, but in 2023 he rushed for 966 yards and nine TDs.\nWhether the Broncos can make up the difference remains to be seen.\n\u201cAshton is one of the top leaders I\u2019ve ever been around in all my years coaching,\u201d Danielson said. \u201cHe had that innate sense that could grab a kid, have a one-on-one conversation. Could speak to the entire room. Would also lead by example.\u201d\nTaking the next step\nBoise State appeared in the playoff last season for the first time. The Broncos, who received a first-round bye, were demolished by Penn State 31-14 in the quarterfinals.\n\u201cWe went to the playoffs, but we lost,\u201d Casey said. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing that I always think about. We were the fourth team to go to the Fiesta Bowl; we were the first Boise State team to fall short. That is deep in our hearts and deep in our thoughts, that we are not going to let that be our legacy. We want to build off of something no Boise State team has ever done. We want to go on a run.\u201d\nSEC West at UNLV?\nMullen isn\u2019t the only one who gives UNLV a Southeastern Conference feel as he replaces Barry Odom, who parlayed back-to-back Mountain West title game appearances into the Purdue job.\nIn addition to Pope, other new Rebels include cornerbacks Denver Harris (previously LSU and Texas A&M) and Laterrance Welch (LSU).\nDrawing players from one of the country\u2019s most dominant conference probably isn\u2019t the worst strategy.\n\u201cThe more guys in the program that knows what it takes in an SEC program to win, it\u2019s going to translate over to here,\u201d Pope said.\nSpartans on the rise\nSan Jose State, like UNLV, for many years was at or near the bottom of the Mountain West until recently.\nThe Spartans posted four seven-win seasons in the past five years under two coaches. Brent Brennan built the program before leaving for Arizona after the 2023 season. Ken Niumatalolo \u2014 who went 109-83 over 16 years at Navy \u2014 took over and guided San Jose State to a 7-6 record last season.\nSan Jose State was picked third in the Mountain West.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re way more mature,\u201d Niumatalolo said. \u201cI felt a little chaotic at this time last year implementing our culture, implementing what we do. I feel like that stuff\u2019s already in place.\u201d\n___\nAP college football: https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-football-poll and https://apnews.com/hub/college-football"
