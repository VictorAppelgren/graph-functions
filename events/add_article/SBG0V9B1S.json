      "summary": "Europe is accelerating a digital sovereignty push, driven by concerns over US cloud dominance and the CLOUD Act. France’s minister Clara Chappaz has called for a coordinated ‘pack’ response, including sovereign cloud certification (SecNumCloud) and potential digital taxes on Big Tech. Germany and Denmark are phasing out Microsoft products in favor of open‑source alternatives, while France and the EU are investing in domestic providers like OVHcloud to secure data control and reduce vendor lock‑in. These moves aim to protect EU data privacy, enhance resilience, and shift the balance of power away from US hyperscalers.",
