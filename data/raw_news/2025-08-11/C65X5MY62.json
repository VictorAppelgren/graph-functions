  "content": "Ransom demands and extortion tactics are becoming more strategic, often aimed at reputation damage rather than just financial theft.\n\nThe human layer remains the most targeted and effective vector for compromise, even in highly regulated industries like aviation and finance.\n\nThe business perimeter has become as global and interconnected as commerce itself.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nOn Aug. 6, Air France and KLM issued a public disclosure announcing that customer data had been compromised following a security incident involving a third-party service provider used by their customer contact centers.\n\nThe airline group confirmed that personal details such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, frequent flyer numbers and customer service message metadata were exposed. Crucially, no passwords, payment information, or ID documents were affected, according to official statements.\n\nThe breach represents a textbook case of third-party risk. While the airline\u2019s internal infrastructure remained secure, attackers gained access through a platform integrated into customer operations. Organizations increasingly rely on external vendors like CRM systems, ticketing services or marketing tools, which creates a complex digital supply chain where indirect access can lead to direct consequences.\n\nThat\u2019s why, in 2025, being secure means more than securing systems. It means securing relationships, data flows and the human behaviors that surround them.\n\nRead more: Know Your Sector, Know Your Scam: eCommerce Fraud in 2025\n\nThe incident involving Air France and KLM is not an outlier but an example of how vulnerable modern organizations have become, even those with significant resources, to widely known but highly effective intrusion techniques. The breach is ultimately part of a broader trend: attackers exploiting the human element and targeting the digital supply chain.\n\nThe PYMNTS Intelligence August 2025 Certainty Project report, \u201cVendors and Vulnerabilities: The Cyberattack Squeeze on Mid-Market Firms,\u201d found widespread fears about social engineering targeting payments, with 87% of mid-market firms at least somewhat concerned.\n\nAt the same time, B2B cyber audits can help organizations assess their security posture, identify vulnerabilities and build trust with partners and clients. For C-suite leaders, these audits are not just about compliance but about safeguarding their enterprise\u2019s long-term stability, resilience and trust.\n\nPhishing via look-alike login portals remains a persistent threat. In these attacks, users are directed to fake login pages designed to replicate legitimate services, often via email, SMS, or compromised chat platforms. Once credentials are entered, attackers use them to access corporate systems or third-party SaaS platforms.\n\nA wave of data breaches impacting companies like Qantas, Allianz Life, LVMH and Adidas, for instance, was tied by Google researchers to a hacker group using voice phishing attacks to steal data from Salesforce CRM instances.\n\nThreat actors are also now commonly using search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning to place malicious pages near the top of search results. These pages can often mimic legitimate login portals, software downloads, or vendor sites. Employees searching for \u201cvendor login\u201d or \u201cpartner portal\u201d may be misled into visiting compromised sites.\n\nSee also: What B2B Firms Can Learn From Big Tech\u2019s Cybersecurity Initiatives\n\nIn a globally interconnected economy, the traditional fortress model of cybersecurity has become obsolete. The \u201cperimeter\u201d now encompasses not just a company\u2019s own systems, but every partner, platform and subcontractor touching its data.\n\nWhile vulnerabilities in code and configuration remain important, human factors often seal the breach. Attackers increasingly combine technical compromise with psychological manipulation.\n\nIn security circles, the model is called the \u201cextended enterprise.\u201d In practice, it\u2019s a digital ecosystem where the old perimeter model \u2014 defending your own network from the outside world \u2014 has been replaced by an intricate web of shared connections.\n\nCybersecurity is no longer an IT-only function. It is a business risk, a customer trust issue and in some sectors, a matter of regulatory survival. CISOs are finding new allies in CFOs and COOs who increasingly see security investments as risk mitigation for business continuity. The conversation is no longer about \u201cif\u201d a breach will happen, but \u201cwhere\u201d and \u201cthrough whom.\u201d\n\nThe PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cThe AI MonitorEdge Report: COOs Leverage GenAI to Reduce Data Security Losses\u201d found that the share of chief operating officers (COOs) who said their companies had implemented AI-powered automated cybersecurity management systems leapt from 17% in May 2024 to 55% in August.\n\nMitigating this risk requires both technology and governance: rigorous vendor vetting, contractual clarity, continuous monitoring, and a corporate culture that treats security as a shared responsibility.",

      "text": "No one knows this better than some of the world\u2019s biggest tech firms, like Microsoft and IBM, which are using digital identity for their own enterprise security.\nAt its core, digital identity refers to the digital representation of an individual\u2019s or entity\u2019s information, allowing systems to authenticate and authorize access securely. Traditionally, businesses have relied on centralized identity management systems like the classic username and password paradigm. However, as cybercriminals become more sophisticated, these traditional methods are increasingly proving insufficient.\nDecentralized identity solutions, which use blockchain and cryptographic technologies, offer a promising alternative. These solutions allow individuals and entities to control their identity credentials, reducing the reliance on centralized databases that are prime targets for cyberattacks.\nMicrosoft, for instance, is experimenting with its Microsoft Entra Verified ID, enabling organizations to issue and verify decentralized digital identities. IBM, too, is exploring blockchain-based identity systems, focusing on enhancing security and privacy.\nThis interest by Big Tech in pioneering decentralized identity solutions reveals a growing recognition of the critical role digital identity management plays in protecting enterprise assets.\nRead also: Blockchain\u2019s New Identity Paradigm Helps Reimagine Enterprise Cyber Protection\nWhy Digital Identity Matters for Cybersecurity\nDigital identity sits at the intersection of security and user experience. When executed well, it can provide seamless access to systems while mitigating risks.\nFor example, digital identity solutions can move beyond passwords, incorporating multifactor authentication, biometric data and behavior-based verification. Decentralized identity frameworks help ensure that only the right individuals or systems gain access to specific resources, something that can be crucial in preventing unauthorized access.\nThe key concept behind decentralized identity is that by eliminating centralized identity repositories, businesses can help reduce the risk of large-scale data breaches.\nWhile Big Tech has the resources to pioneer advanced cybersecurity solutions, B2B firms can experiment with and adopt many of these strategies without breaking the bank.\nMicrosoft, Google and others have adopted a \u201cZero Trust\u201d model, where every access request is treated as potentially hostile until verified. B2B firms can adopt this approach by implementing continuous authentication and authorization protocols within their systems.\n\u201cIn the same way that I trust physical keys to the physical lock on my home, I trust digital keys for my digital life,\u201d Adam Lowe, chief product and innovation officer at Arculus/CompoSecure, told PYMNTS this month.\nFollowing the lead of tech giants, B2B companies can also focus on robust identity and access management (IAM) practices, ensuring digital identities are authenticated and authorized properly across all systems.\n\u201cIf a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is,\u201d Chris Ward, head of enterprise payments at Truist, told PYMNTS this month. \u201cBusinesses \u2026 need to be vigilant, especially when transacting with unknown entities or offers that appear overly enticing.\u201d\nBuilding Trust With Clients and Partners\nWhile implementing advances such as blockchain-based systems may not be feasible for all businesses, elements of decentralized identity can still be adopted, such as verifiable credentials and cryptographic authentication methods.\nA robust digital identity strategy does more than just secure internal systems; it also bolsters trust externally. For B2B firms, demonstrating a strong cybersecurity posture can be a competitive advantage. Clients and partners increasingly want assurance that their data and interactions are secure, particularly as supply chain uncertainty becomes more prevalent.\nB2B cyber audits can help organizations assess their security posture, identify vulnerabilities and build trust with partners and clients. For C-suite leaders, these audits are not just about compliance but about safeguarding their enterprise\u2019s long-term stability, resilience and trust.\nWhen clients know that a firm is using proven cyber practices, it can help to enhance credibility and lead to deeper business relationships.\nUltimately, while the complexity of cybersecurity continues to grow, so do the tools and strategies available. Digital identity is a powerful lever, and the landscape is still evolving, with emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning offering new opportunities to enhance security further.\nFor all PYMNTS B2B and Digital Transformation coverage, subscribe to the daily B2B and Digital Transformation Newsletters."

      "text": "Whether it\u2019s bogus chargebacks plaguing fashion retailers, artificial intelligence deepfakes driving false reviews, fake SKU inflation hitting electronics sellers, or return abuse targeting beauty brands, today\u2019s eCommerce scams are no longer the work of lone wolves or clumsy opportunists wearing hoodies with Dorito dust on their fingers. The most modern breed of scams and cyber fraud is targeted, sector-specific, and often automated.\nIncreasingly, these scams can look a lot like legitimate behavior. The latest annual report from Amazon\u2019s Counterfeit Crimes Unit revealed that eCommerce scams are evolving as fast, if not faster, than the platforms they exploit.\nThe common thread among contemporary eCommerce scams isn\u2019t just the product. It\u2019s the assumption that eCommerce is frictionless, and the attack vectors that this assumption opens for criminals.\nThe impact of eCommerce fraud is real. Amazon\u2019s report highlighted that over the past five years, Amazon has filed more than 200 civil suits with the resulting settlements and judgments totaling over $180 million, with more than 65 individuals sent to prison.\nAs the summer shopping season heats up, with Amazon for example having extended its Prime Day event to four days (July 8-11), prompting Walmart and Target to launch competing sales windows, online merchants must ensure that when a customer clicks \u201cbuy,\u201d they get their purchase, not a fraud-driven headache.\nRead also: Dissecting the Criminal Mind: Why They Target Company Data\nThe New Face of eCommerce Fraud\nIn 2025, eCommerce crime isn\u2019t monolithic. It\u2019s a mosaic of threats, each tailored to the operational rhythms of different verticals.\nFashion retailers, for example, can find themselves grappling with a rise in friendly fraud and false chargebacks from customers who claim an item wasn\u2019t delivered or was returned, when in fact it wasn\u2019t. The industry\u2019s high transaction volume, combined with liberal return policies and frequent promotions, creates fertile ground for abuse.\nMeanwhile, consumer electronics sellers face an altogether different problem: SKU inflation. Here, fraudsters can manipulate product listings by inflating reviews, boosting visibility for counterfeit or low-quality goods. In some cases, they hijack dormant Amazon Standard Identification Numbers, or ASINs, repurposing them for different products. It\u2019s a quiet heist \u2014 no stolen credit cards, just hijacked trust.\nMeanwhile, the beauty sector is a multibillion-dollar industry plagued by counterfeit goods. But now, even legitimate sellers are under siege, thanks to return abuse. Scammers have been known to order expensive skincare products, replace the contents with lookalike substitutes, or even just water, and ship them back for a full refund. Thanks to automated returns systems, they often get away with it.\nWhat makes eCommerce scams especially difficult to police today is the extent to which they are automated. Fraudsters are using bots not only to mass-create fake accounts but also to conduct A/B testing on the fraud itself \u2014 trying out different refund stories, testing chargeback strategies, and optimizing language for maximum success.\nCompanies aren\u2019t sitting idly by. The most forward-thinking eCommerce platforms are adopting a multilayered approach to fraud prevention, one that combines traditional rule-based systems with real-time AI, behavioral analytics and supply chain traceability innovations.\nSee also: Rise of Industrialized Fraud Heats Up Cyber Arms Race\nDigital Commerce Fraud Prevention Is Becoming Predictive, Not Reactive\nThe changing nature of commerce is helping to drive the changing face of fraud. According to PYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s \u201c2025 Global Digital Shopping Index,\u201d drawn from a survey of over 18,000 consumers and nearly 3,500 merchants across eight countries, 60% of consumers browse merchant sites on their phone multiple times a week, converting nearly half of those browsing sessions into sales.\nAs PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster said in an interview with Block Risk Lead Brian Boates, PYMNTS Intelligence found that even tech-savvy young consumers who use their phones as a conduit to everyday life reported the challenges of avoiding scams.\n\u201cThe last time we went into the field, we found that about 3 in 10 consumers say they\u2019ve been scammed, and about 40% of Gen Z\u201d has fallen prey to the fraudsters, Webster said.\nMeanwhile, the PYMNTS Intelligence report \u201cHow eCommerce Merchants Fight Fraud for the Holiday Shopping Season\u201d found that many shoppers are willing to pay a premium to prevent eCommerce fraud. Nearly one-third of consumers said they are willing to pay up to 5% of the total cost of their transactions for relevant insurance coverage. Similarly, 70% of consumers said having greater insurance protection would increase their confidence in making online purchases. Today, insurance protection is available from roughly half of eCommerce merchants.\nUltimately, the fight against eCommerce scams isn\u2019t about achieving zero fraud \u2014 that\u2019s an impossible target. It\u2019s about developing resilience \u2014 the ability to detect, respond and adapt in real time.\nFor all PYMNTS digital transformation coverage, subscribe to the daily Digital Transformation Newsletter."

      "text": "Writing on its blog Tuesday evening (Aug. 5), the tech giant\u2019s Threat Intelligence Group said one of its Salesforce database systems, used to house contact information and related notes for small and medium-sized businesses, was breached by a hacking group known as ShinyHunters.\n\u201cAnalysis revealed that data was retrieved by the threat actor during a small window of time before the access was cut off,\u201d the blog post said.\n\u201cThe data retrieved by the threat actor was confined to basic and largely publicly available business information, such as business names and contact details.\u201d\nThe blog post says the intelligence group suspects the hackers could be planning to \u201cescalate their extortion tactics\u201d by initiating a data leak site (DLS).\nGoogle said these new tactics \u201care likely intended to increase pressure on victims,\u201d including those associated with the recent Salesforce-related data breaches. The company added it would continue to monitor this activity.\nGoogle recently announced it had added new agentic artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to its cybersecurity platform. Days later, PYMNTS examined the implications of this type of technology in the battle against cyberattacks.\n\u201cFor business leaders, especially chief information security officers (CISOs) and chief financial officers (CFOs), this rising reality may pose new questions,\u201d the report said. \u201cAre enterprise organizations ready for defense at machine speed? What\u2019s the cost of not adopting these tools? Who\u2019s accountable when AI systems take action?\u201d\nZero-day vulnerabilities \u2014 unknown security flaws in software or hardware \u2014 are often discovered by adversaries first, exploited quietly, and later revealed when the damage is done, the report said.\n\u201cFor CISOs, this means a new category of tools is emerging. They\u2019re AI-first threat prevention platforms that don\u2019t wait for alerts but seek out weak points in code, configurations or behavior, and they take defensive action automatically,\u201d the report said.\nAnd for finance chiefs, it could mean a \u201cchange in cybersecurity economics,\u201d as prevention at this scale could be less costly and more scalable, but only if the AI is accurate and accountable.\n\u201cThe models are only as good as the data being fed to them,\u201d Boost Payment Solutions Chief Technology Officer Rinku Sharma told PYMNTS in an April interview. \u201cGarbage in, garbage out holds true even with agentic AI.\u201d\nResearch by PYMNTS Intelligence has shown that the share of chief operating officers (COOs) who said their companies had implemented AI-powered automated cybersecurity management systems had jumped from 17% in May 2024 to 55% three months later."

Among those reporting very positive return on investment (ROI), the estimated share of annual revenue saved is 7.7%.\nCOOs with firms that use the technology for high-impact tasks like data security expect AI\u2019s ROI to be very positive in 5.6 years and expect that the technology will be fully embedded in their organizations in 6.9 years.\nAutomating Security Response\nAI is transforming how security teams handle cyberthreats. The technology automates the initial stages of incident investigation by analyzing vast amounts of data, and speeds up response times by allowing security professionals to begin their work with a clear understanding of the situation, PYMNTS reported in March.\nCompanies are adopting this technology amid an AI-driven escalation of threats in which cybercriminals have been loading up their arsenal of AI-powered scams and frauds, PYMNTS reported Dec. 2.\nAmazon Chief Information Security Officer CJ Moses said that the eCommerce giant has seen hacking attempts increase more than sevenfold over the past six months in large part due to AI. Leveraging advanced AI tactics, cybercriminals are exploiting vulnerabilities at unprecedented speed and scale.\nAI Enables \u2018Proactive Approach\u2019\nThe democratization of technologies like AI has made complex tools available to virtually anyone, making it easier for cybercriminals to carry out attacks, Chris Wyatt, chief strategy officer at Finexio, told PYMNTS in an interview posted in August.\nThat\u2019s why the potential of AI to transform how companies manage their cybersecurity efforts is becoming so crucial, Wyatt said.\nOne example of how AI-powered cybersecurity tools can combat sophisticated AI-powered attacks is by analyzing URLs, emails and messages in real time to detect and block phishing attempts and social engineering attacks before they reach users, J Stephen Kowski, field CTO at SlashNext, told PYMNTS in an article posted in November.\n\u201cAdvanced machine learning models can now understand the context and intent of communications, moving beyond simple pattern matching to identify threats that would bypass traditional security tools,\u201d Kowski said. \u201cThis proactive approach represents a shift from reactive, signature-based detection to predictive threat prevention that adapts to new attack variations in real time.\u201d"

      "text": "Today\u2019s digital landscape is breaking down traditional silos \u2014 especially those around core business risks.\nCybersecurity, which was at one point viewed primarily as an IT concern, has leapfrogged to the top of the priority list for chief financial officers (CFOs) and chief information security officers (CISOs).\nAfter all, cyber threats are everywhere, and they don\u2019t just target big corporations: they go after partners, suppliers and third-party vendors too. As businesses increasingly rely on third-party vendors, partners, and suppliers to operate efficiently, the need for robust business-to-business (B2B) cyber audits has never been more critical.\nFor example, online food delivery marketplace Grubhub said last week (Feb. 3) that it recently identified an incident involving a third-party contractor; while Cleo on Monday (Feb. 10) launched a tool for freight brokers, carriers and third-party logistics providers (3PLs) designed to help reduce supply chain risk.\nWhether driven by regulatory mandates, contractual obligations, or internal risk management, B2B cyber audits help organizations assess their security posture, identify vulnerabilities, and build trust with partners and clients. For C-suite leaders, these audits are not just about compliance but about safeguarding their enterprise\u2019s long-term stability, resilience and trust.\nRead more: Managing Third-Party Risks Emerges as Key B2B Issue\nMitigating Risk Across the Expanding Cyber Threat Landscape\nThe need for enhanced security assessments is underscored by the growing scale and sophistication of cyberattacks. Ransomware attacks have surged, supply chain vulnerabilities are more pronounced than ever and compliance requirements continue to evolve. In response, organizations are becoming interested in conducting more rigorous cybersecurity audits, ensuring that their operations \u2014 and those of their partners \u2014 are resilient against emerging threats.\nAs evidenced by 2024\u2019s biggest breaches, including the snowball impact of the Snowflake cloud hack, B2B organizations and their internal leadership are more and more recognizing that a single vulnerability in a third-party vendor can have cascading consequences across their entire network.\nFor CFOs and CISOs, the realities of the threat landscape are reshaping the calculus around security. While traditional network perimeter defenses remain important, attackers are increasingly targeting cloud environments, software supply chains and even operational technology systems.\nSupply chain security is increasingly now a boardroom discussion, and contractual obligations are another major driver of cybersecurity audits. Enterprises, including PYMNTS and PYMNTS clients, are increasingly demanding that their vendors and business partners adhere to stringent security standards, ensuring that shared data and interconnected systems are not vulnerable to breaches.\nFor CFOs, this is more than a technology concern \u2014 it\u2019s a financial and regulatory issue.
