  "description": "Jurassic Park: Survival devs say they want you to \"experience the terror for yourself.\"",
  "content": "Saber Interactive has released new footage from its upcoming single-player RPG, Jurassic Park: Survival. The video, which was uploaded to the official Jurassic Park: Survival YouTube channel, gives players glimpses of previously unseen footage from the game, and reveals more about the narrative and behind-the-scenes work that went into bringing its cast of prehistoric creatures \u2014 and its human protagonist \u2014 to life.\n\nSet one day after the events of 1993's iconic Jurassic Park movie, Jurassic Park: Survival follows the story of Dr. Maya Joshi, an InGen scientist who was left behind during the evacuation of Isla Nublar. A clever girl in her own right, Maya is trapped on the island with no company aside from the island's deadly, prehistoric inhabitants. The goal is simple: Survive. But footage from the behind-the-scenes video reveals that, as Maya, players will have to navigate the island (and hopefully escape it) without ending up in the belly of the beasts roaming the park. The footage also reveals that the film's iconic velociraptor scene \u2014 in which two children are hunted through the park's kitchen facilities by a pair of deadly raptors \u2014 is something players will get to experience firsthand in Jurassic Park: Survival.\n\n\"When we were deciding how to introduce the raptors, one thing that jumped out to us was, 'What if we could make the player experience what Lex and Tim did in the kitchen?'\" creative director Oliver Hollis-Leck explained. \"That, and other sequences like it, are meant to put you in the shoes of those movie characters, to experience the terror for yourself.\"\n\nDevelopers at Saber Interactive say they got up close and personal with various props, set pieces, and concept art images from the original film to ensure the game feels authentic. The video also showed off a clip in which Maya is eaten by a T. rex after failing to escape it, something Jurassic World project executive Lisa St. Armand says she can't wait to experience firsthand.\n\n\"Can't wait to come face-to-face with the T. rex,\" St. Armand said. \"I'm going to purposely lose, so that I can get eaten by the T. rex.\"\n\nSaber Interactive hasn't yet announced a release date for Jurassic Park: Survival, but has confirmed the game will launch on PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.\n\n\"We were inspired by the original film,\" Saber Interactive CEO Matthew Karch explained. \"All the encounters are gonna be amazing, the interactions with the dinosaurs, to see them on the big screen\u2026 and it's something else when you can actually take part and interact with them in a meaningful way.\"",
