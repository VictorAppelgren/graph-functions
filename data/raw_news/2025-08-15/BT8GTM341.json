  "title": "Sen. Hawley says he'll investigate Meta's 'sensual' child chatbot policies",
  "description": "It follows Reuters' leak of a policy document that permitted 'sensual' AI conversations with children.",
  "content": "This week's Meta AI chatbot leak could have repercussions for the company beyond bad PR. On Friday, Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO) said the Senate Committee Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, which he chairs, will investigate the company.\n\n\"Your company has acknowledged the veracity of these reports and made retractions only after this alarming content came to light,\" Hawley wrote in a letter to Mark Zuckerberg. \"It's unacceptable that these policies were advanced in the first place.\"\n\nThe internal Meta document included some disturbing examples of allowed chatbot behavior. This included \"sensual\" conversations with children. For example, the AI was permitted to tell a shirtless eight-year-old that \"every inch of you is a masterpiece \u2014 a treasure I cherish deeply.\" The document dealt with race in similarly jarring ways. \"Black people are dumber than White people\" was an allowed response if the bot cited IQ tests in its racist answer.\n\nIn a statement to Engadget, Meta described the (since removed) examples as ancillary content separate from its policies. \"The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies and have been removed,\" the company said.\n\nHawley asked Zuckerberg to preserve relevant records and produce documents for the investigation. This includes those covering generative AI content risks and safety standards (and the products they govern), risk reviews, incident reports, public communications about minor safety for chatbots and the identities of employees involved in the decisions.\n\nWhile it's easy to applaud someone holding Meta to task, it's worth noting that Senator Hawley's letter to Meta made no mention of the racist parts of the policy document. Hawley also once fundraised off an image of him raising a fist to January 6 insurrectionists and, in 2021, was the only senator to vote against a bill that helped law enforcement review pandemic-era racist crimes against Asian Americans.",

      "text": "Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley\u2019s campaign will continue selling merchandise featuring a photo of him pumping his fist in support of protesters the day a mob stormed the U.S. Capitol to overturn the outcome of the presidential election.\nThe photo in question was taken by a photographer for an energy and environment trade publication owned by Politico. Hawley\u2019s campaign began last month selling coffee mugs and other items featuring an illustrated version of the photo.\nLast week, Politico sent a cease and desist letter asking the campaign to stop selling items featuring the copyrighted image.\n\u201cWe do not authorize its use by the Hawley campaign for the purpose of political fundraising, which the campaign has been put on notice of by legal counsel,\u201d Politico spokesperson Brad Dayspring said.\nIn response, Hawley\u2019s campaign sent out a press release Friday saying the image fell under \u201cfair use\u201d laws.\n\u201cThe image used on the mug is a protected fair use and the Hawley campaign\u2019s speech is further protected by the First Amendment,\u201d wrote Jessica Furst Johnson, Hawley\u2019s campaign counsel, in a letter sent to the media. \u201cNeither the campaign nor Sen. Hawley will engage in self-censorship to placate the legally baseless demands of your client.\u201d\nTaken as Hawley was entering the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, the photo shows him raising his fist in support of demonstrators who had gathered to protest the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s Electoral College victory.\nHawley had a few weeks earlier announced he would object to the certification when Congress convened to ratify the results of the 2020 election. When the day finally arrived, he was greeted as a hero by protesters.\nLater in the day, however, the protests turned violent, with a pro-Trump mob forcing its way into the Capitol and on to the floor of the House and Senate, endangering lawmakers, staffers and reporters who were evacuated to an undisclosed location.\nCongress was able to eventually reconvene and certify Biden\u2019s victory, though even after the day\u2019s violence Hawley continued to argue Pennsylvania\u2019s electoral votes should be disqualified because he believes a 2019 law approved by the state\u2019s Republican legislature and sustained by the state\u2019s supreme court violates the Pennsylvania constitution.\nHawley faced accusations that his rhetoric and actions in the days leading up to the certification vote contributed to the violence.\nAmong the loudest critics is his political mentor \u2014 former U.S. Sen. John Danforth \u2014 who said working to get Hawley elected to the Senate in 2018 \u201cwas the worst mistake I ever made in my life.\u201d State Rep. Shamed Dogan, a Republican from Ballwin running for St. Louis County executive, tweeted that he regretted voting for Hawley in 2018.\nFor his part, however, Hawley has always defended his actions on Jan. 6, telling the Washington Post that the demonstrators he encountered when he was captured raising his fist were peaceful.\n\u201cSome of them were calling, so I gestured toward them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had every right to be there\u2026 When I walked by that particular group of folks were standing there peacefully behind police barricades.\u201d\nIn the year since the Jan. 6 insurrection, the stolen election lie has continued to grow in power within the GOP base, fueled by the former president and his supporters working to cast doubt on the outcome of the 2020 campaign.\nMany Republicans have also begun to downplay the significance of the Jan 6 violence that resulted in five deaths. The Republican National Committee voted to censure GOP members of Congress who participate in an inquiry Jan. 6, saying the probe amounted to persecution for \u201clegitimate political discourse.\u201d\nThis story was originally published in the Missouri Independent."

      "text": "This morning, U.S. Senator Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) penned a letter to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, demanding the company hand over all relevant documents and communications related to new disturbing reporting that its AI chatbots engage children in \u201cromantic\u201d and sensual\u201d online exchanges.\n\u201cParents deserve the truth, and kids deserve protection,\u201d Senator Hawley wrote.\n\u201cThe Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, which I chair, will commence an investigation into whether Meta\u2019s generative-AI products enable exploitation, deception, or other criminal harms to children, and whether Meta misled the public or regulators about its safeguards,\u201d he continued.\nSenator Hawley first sounded the alarm on this explosive reporting yesterday, pointing out that \u201conly after Meta got CAUGHT did it retract portions of its company doc that deemed it \u2018permissible for chatbots to flirt and engage in romantic roleplay with children.'\u201d\nAs Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, Senator Hawley recently led a separate oversight hearing into Meta that exposed the tech company\u2019s stunning complicity with China.\nRead Senator Hawley\u2019s full letter from today here or below.\nAugust 15, 2025\nMark Zuckerberg\nFounder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer\nMeta Platforms, Inc.\n1 Meta Way\nMenlo Park, CA 94025\nDear Mr. Zuckerberg,\nReports indicate that Meta approved internal rules for its AI chatbots that would allow \u201cromantic\u201d and \u201csensual\u201d exchanges with children, while green-lighting other harmful content behind legal word games. Your company has acknowledged the veracity of these reports and made retractions only after this alarming content came to light. It\u2019s unacceptable that these policies were advanced in the first place. Meta must immediately preserve all relevant records and produce responsive documents so Congress can investigate these troubling practices.\nTo take but one example, your internal rules purportedly permit an AI chatbot to comment that an eight-year-old\u2019s body is \u201ca work of art\u201d of which \u201cevery inch . . . is a masterpiece\u2014a treasure I cherish deeply.\u201d Similar conduct outlined in these reports is reprehensible and outrageous\u2014and demonstrates a cavalier attitude when it comes to the real risks that generative AI presents to youth development absent strong guardrails. Parents deserve the truth, and kids deserve protection.\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, which I chair, will commence an investigation into whether Meta\u2019s generative-AI products enable exploitation, deception, or other criminal harms to children, and whether Meta misled the public or regulators about its safeguards. We intend to learn who approved these policies, how long they were in effect, and what Meta has done to stop this conduct going forward.\nAccordingly, produce the following no later than September 19, 2025:\n1. \u201cGenAI: Content Risk Standards\u201d\u2014All Versions\n- Every draft, redline, and final version of \u201cGenAI: Content Risk Standards,\u201d including all regional variants, appendices, and preceding and succeeding policies.\n2. Scope, Deployment, and Enforcement:\n- A list of every Meta product/model governed by these standards.\n- Enforcement playbooks, guardrail/classifier specs, refusal policies, evaluator guidelines, and known gaps/exceptions.\n- All age-gating/minor-protection controls for chatbots, including all documents related to how Meta prevents, detects, and blocks \u201cromantic\u201d or \u201csensual\u201d exchanges with users under 18, as well as documents relating to what Meta does when age is unknown.\n3. Risk Reviews and Incident Reports:\n- All documents relating to safety reviews, red-team reports, risk registers, incident logs, and post-mortems referencing minors, sexual/romantic role-play, in-person meetups, medical advice, self-harm, or criminal exploitation.\n- Any materials provided to or prepared for senior leadership on these risks.\n4. Public Claims and Regulator Communications:\n- All drafts, talking points, or statements to users, advertisers, app stores, the FTC, Congress, or other authorities about minor safety and medical-advice limits for Meta\u2019s chatbots.\n5. Identities of Individuals and Actions Changing Policy:\n- Documents sufficient to establish the decision trail for removing or revising any portions of the standards: who decided, when, why, who was notified, and what changes were actually implemented across products.\nSincerely,\nJosh Hawley\nChairman\nCommittee on the Judiciary\nSubcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism"

      "text": "Here's What The New Hate Crimes Law Aims To Do As Attacks On Asian Americans Rise\nFollowing overwhelming support from both chambers of Congress, President Biden signed legislation Thursday that addresses hate crimes throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, with particular emphasis on the increase in violence against Asian Americans.\nAt an event in the East Room of the White House, Biden thanked lawmakers for coming together to pass the legislation. He said standing against hatred and racism, which he called \"the ugly poison that has long haunted and plagued our nation,\" is what brings Americans together.\n\"My message to all of those who are hurting is: We see you and the Congress has said, we see you. And we are committed to stop the hatred and the bias,\" he said.\nHate has no place in America \u2013 and I look forward to making that clear this afternoon by signing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law.\n\u2014 President Biden Archived (@POTUS46Archive) May 20, 2021\nThe legislation, introduced by Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., and Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, aims to make the reporting of hate crimes more accessible at the local and state levels by boosting public outreach and ensuring reporting resources are available online in multiple languages.\nIt also directs the Department of Justice to designate a point person to expedite the review of hate crimes related to COVID-19 and authorizes grants to state and local governments to conduct crime-reduction programs to prevent and respond to hate crimes.\nVice President Harris introduced Biden ahead of the signing and reflected on the increase in violence against Asian Americans.\n\"This violence \u2014 it did not come from nowhere, and none of it is new. In my life, my lived experience, I have seen how hate can pervade our communities,\" she said. Harris, who is the first Asian American vice president, added, \"I have seen how hate can impede our progress. And I have seen how people uniting against hate can strengthen our country.\"\nHarris noted the work to combat racism doesn't end with the signing of the bill.\n\"Here's the truth: Racism exists in America. Xenophobia exists in America, antisemitism, Islamophobia, homophobia, transphobia \u2014 it all exists. And so the work to address injustice wherever it exists remains the work ahead,\" she said.\nThe signing comes two days after the House of Representatives passed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act by a vote of 364-62; all 62 votes against the bill were from Republicans. The Senate approved the legislation last month, with near-unanimous support; Missouri Republican Josh Hawley was the sole senator to vote against the bill.\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., attended Thursday's ceremony along with a number of Democrats, advocates, families of victims of hate crimes and others. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who helped co-author a key provision that paved the way for the bill's passage, was also in attendance.\nAsian Americans have faced a dramatic spike in violence throughout the pandemic. The organization Stop AAPI Hate documented 6,603 hate incidents from March 2020 to March 2021, and leaders said the true number is much higher as many hate crimes go unreported. Democrats have pointed to former President Donald Trump's frequent use of racist phrases such as \"kung flu\" to describe the coronavirus as a link to the increase in anti-Asian sentiment in the country.\nStop AAPI Hate praised the legislation for investing in \"community-centered solutions and provisions to mitigate anti-Asian rhetoric\" but said further legislation is needed to address the \"root causes of systemic racism and oppression.\"\n\"Because the Act centers criminal law enforcement agencies in its solutions, it will not address the overwhelming majority of incidents reported to our site which are not hate crimes, but serious hate incidents,\" the coalition said in a statement after the House passage.\nAttorney General Merrick Garland called the bill signing an \"important step toward protecting everyone in our country from acts of hate and intolerance.\"\n\"The Department of Justice is proud to play a central role in implementing this legislation,\" he said in a statement following the signing. \"Investigating and prosecuting hate crimes is a top priority, deeply rooted in the department's founding. We will use the new law to enhance the aggressive measures we are taking to combat crime motivated by bigotry and discrimination.\"\nRead the full legislation below."
