  "description": "Key Insights Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Everyman Media Group fair value estimate is UK\u00a30.48 With...",
  "content": "\u2022 Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Everyman Media Group fair value estimate is UK\u00a30.48\n\u2022 With UK\u00a30.42 share price, Everyman Media Group appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value\n\u2022 The average premium for Everyman Media Group's competitorsis currently 1,276% Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Everyman Media Group plc (LON:EMAN) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex. Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free. We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = UK\u00a321m We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.7%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 13%.\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= UK\u00a377m\u00f7 ( 1 + 13%)10= UK\u00a323m The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is UK\u00a344m. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of UK\u00a30.4, the company appears about fair value at a 13% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. The calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Everyman Media Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 13%, which is based on a levered beta of 2.000. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. Check out our latest analysis for Everyman Media Group Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

  "argos_summary": "Everyman Media Group (LON:EMAN) is valued at UK\u00a30.48 per share using a 2\u2011stage DCF model, placing its current trading price of UK\u00a30.42 near fair value. The analysis highlights a high industry premium (\u22481,276%) and notes the company\u2019s unprofitable status, high debt/equity ratio, and modest revenue growth of 11.2% per year. Despite a fair value discount of about 13%, analyst coverage is limited and the stock\u2019s valuation is considered weak relative to peers. The report underscores the sensitivity of the valuation to discount rate and cash\u2011flow assumptions, and signals potential upside if the company improves profitability and reduces leverage.",
