  "title": "This EV Set A Guinness World Record For Towing (And It Pulled More Than 150 Tons)",
  "description": "The Guinness world record for heaviest weight towed by an electric van was set in 2023 when an Iveco van driven by Adam Bishop towed more than 150 tonnes.",
  "content": "If you've got something that needs towing, the chances are you want to get your hands on a capable pickup truck to get the job done. It makes sense, with Ford's F-150 currently capable of pulling 13,500 pounds, and the most capable heavy-duty Ram truck on offer boasting a maximum towing capacity of 36,610 pounds.\n\nIn comparison, the F-150 Lightning, which we drove and reviewed earlier this year, is only rated to tow a maximum of 10,000 pounds. This may leave you thinking that gas- or diesel-powered models are best suited to towing, but British brand Iveco would be keen to correct you there. In an effort to demonstrate the strength of its electric van, Iveco towed 153.58 tons in 2023, setting the official Guinness World Record for towing with an electric van. The load in question consisted of a huge truck, with a digger atop its trailer, a construction truck full of rocks, and an airport fire truck.\n\nThis British van isn't the only electric vehicle that's tried its hand at pulling a gargantuan load in recent years either, as prior to this the Tesla Model X pulled off a similarly impressive feat. Regardless of the fact that a Tesla Model X is only rated to tow 5,000 pounds, in 2018 one example pulled a Boeing Dreamliner 787-9, which tips the scales at 130 tons. This feat gained it the title of 'heaviest weight towed by an electric car' according to Guinness World Records, and it's a record that still stands today.",

      "text": "Here's How Much The Tesla Model X Can Actually Tow\nReleased on the heels of the Model S sedan, Tesla's Model X was the manufacturer's answer to the modern mid-size luxury crossover. Only marginally longer and wider than its full-size sedan counterpart, the Model X shares a similar design to Tesla's flagship vehicle. Some may find it difficult to justify the higher price tag of the Model X, considering the Model S is relatively close or identical in virtually every spec save for cargo space and number of available seats.\nThough the Model S can do just about everything the Model X can, sometimes a little better, as seen with its acceleration and range, there is one crucial area it may be lacking for some buyers \u2014 a standard tow package. The Model X may not be significantly larger than the average sedan, nor is it any more powerful than the Model S, but Tesla equipped the electric vehicle (EV) with a tow package to cater to the SUV side of the crossover concept.\nWhile many shoppers will be eyeing manufacturer stats like the 333-mile driving range (which fell around 300 miles in cold weather tests) or the specs of the dual motor powertrain, if you need a tow hitch, there's going to be one question on your mind: just how much can the Model X tow?\nTow capacity of Tesla's Model X series\nWhen buying a Model X, you'll have two luxury models to choose from, with pricing starting at $79,990. The Long Range serves as the standard model and is powered by 670 horsepower with an estimated 310 pound-feet of torque. Alternatively, the costlier and more powerful option, the Plaid, delivers a far more impressive 1,020 horsepower and an estimated 1,050 pound-feet of torque.\nThe Model S may match the Model X in torque and horsepower, but the Model X comes with a tow hitch that enhances the EV's versatility on the road. At its current specs, the Model X can pull a maximum of 5,000 pounds. There is a catch, though, that pertains to all vehicles \u2014 the maximum towing capacity is based on specific conditions.\nPer Tesla, 5,000 pounds is possible if the EV is outfitted with 255/45R20 or 265/45R20 front tires and 275/45R20 rear tires at 46 psi or 265/35ZR22 front tires and 285/35ZR22 rear tires at 50 psi.\nHow much does towing affect the Model X range?\nJust as with gas-powered vehicles, an electric vehicle's efficiency can be affected by many things. Running the air conditioner too long can drop the driving range, as can poor road conditions and driving in the city over the highway.\nThere's no equation to help determine just how much your range is being cut, but when you do tow with your Model X, you have to expect your driving range to drop drastically. How much you're towing and whether you're driving on straight and narrow roads or hilly territories will further alter the Model X's efficiency.\nIt's estimated that a 3,200-pound trailer, which is well within the capabilities of the Model X, will cut the range by about 29%. So, if your Model X was achieving Tesla's estimated 333-mile range, you'd be dropping down to about 236 miles before you're going to need to charge your Model X.\nThat's not bad when you consider trucks are expected to lose 2% of their fuel economy per every 100 pounds of weight they're pulling. Using that figure, a 3,200-pound trailer would cut fuel efficiency by 64% compared to the Model X's 29% drop."

      "text": "2025 Ford F-150 Lightning Pro Review: Skip XLT And Spend On Range Instead\nThe Ford F-150 Lightning was a big deal when it was first released in 2022. It was billed as a real work truck that just happened to be electric, as opposed to pickups like the Rivian R1T where most of the focus on the truck itself is the fact it's electric. Other electric versions of American trucks, like the Chevy Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV, bear a slight resemblance to their internal combustion counterparts, but those similarities are entirely superficial.\nOn the other side of the spectrum, monstrosities like the Tesla Cybertruck barely even look like a truck. From most angles, in contrast, the F-150 Lightning could be mistaken for any other regular F-150.\nI grew up with Chevy trucks, so I don't have a lot of experience on the Ford side of the Force, but my family did briefly own a very tired 1990 F-150 with exactly no features in the cabin, so really anything that moves under its own power would be a positive. So, when I was offered an F-150 Lightning, I was eager to see what Ford has done to electrify the its pickup mainstay.\nUtilitarian for a reason\nThe Lightning that arrived in my driveway was painted contractor white and fitted with vinyl seats that look like they were taken right out of the back of a police car. The only line items on the window sticker that could be considered \"features\" were dual-zone air conditioning and heated seats. Other than Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, the creature comforts are basically non-existent.\nThis wasn't a mistake at the factory and it's not a result of Ford dropping the ball in marketing the Lightning. This 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning is in the \"PRO\" series that's focused on fleet use or for trade/contracting work. As a result, you won't find it on Ford's regular website; pricing and configuration options are listed Ford's own Pro site.\nIt's bare bones for a reason. You don't want a bunch of features that clutter up the interior when you're on the job site. A premium sound-system doesn't help much when you need to hop in and sprint across the lot ensure that the concrete truck doesn't pour in the wrong place again.\nPower where it's needed\nIgnore the feature-lite nature of the interior, since the mechanical bits are where it shines the most. Under the familiar styling are two electric motors that generate a beefy 452 horsepower and a pretty astonishing 775 pound-feet of torque. I can neither confirm nor deny that I was able to chirp the tires taking off from a stop sign.\nThis Lightning was fitted with the 131 kilowatt-hour Extended Range battery that gave it a maximum range of 320 miles when all charged up (and up to 19.2 kW Level 2 charging support); commercial customers can have the Standard Range version's 98 kWh pack, rated for 240 miles, while the 123 kWh Extended Range battery that's standard on the retail Pro promises 300 miles (and has up to 11.5 kW Level 2 charging).\nWith the biggest pack I was able to get around 300 miles of driving, but it was also well over 90 degrees for most of the week, so that likely adversely impacted the range.\nFor truck people, this Pro was equipped with a Max Trailer Tow Package, which gives it a towing capacity of 7,700 pounds, over the 5,000 pounds of the base model. Lariat-trimmed Lightnings can tow up to 10,000 pounds. It's worth noting that the Rivian R1T can tow up to 11,000 pounds.\nFord's electric muscle truck\nAs for actually driving the Lightning, it was nothing short of a blast. I have the same entertainment sensibilities as a particularly clever ape, so a huge truck with almost 500 horsepower and instant torque is really fun to drive. It's a muscle car that can go to Home Depot. Everyone who says that electric cars are boring have never whipped around an empty parking lot in a Lightning in the rain. It's a lot of fun to drive, dispute its workman-like appearance. I had to run a few errands in downtown Baltimore and it never felt too unwieldy to drive, at least any more than a regular full-size truck. I was even able to parallel park it without much issue.\nAll versions of the Lightning have Pro Power Onboard, which makes sense as they're essentially a rolling battery. In the case of the Pro, the bed, cab, and frunk all feature 120V power outlets: a total of eight as standard, capable of 2.4 kW at 20 amps. A $1,200 upgrade to Pro Power Onboard 9.6 kW not only adds two further outlets, but one in the bed is 240V.\nThat's more than enough juice to run angle grinders, circular saws, and a lot of other job site hardware. Tools with needier power demands like welders would need more external power, but if you're a welder who is reading this and are in the market for an F-150 Lightning, you probably already know that.\nNot a lot going on in the cabin\nThe interior is arguably where the Pro cost-savings are most obvious. Since it has vinyl seats, it got a little sticky-feeling when the temperature reached triple digits occasionally. It never felt stifling on the inside thanks to the freezing cold A/C that was always blasting, but it certainly wasn't ideal when you first get in the car after it's been sitting for a while. My first car was a 1985 Chrysler LeBaron convertible with fake-leather vinyl seats, and getting in the F-150 reminded me a lot of that experience. It's been a while since I sat in a car that had only plastic seats.\nStill, if I was working in a more dirt or grime-centric career, I could see how the vinyl seats would be a lifesaver for keeping the truck clean. Just spray some Clorox, wipe it down, and you'll be fine. I don't think that's the truck's fault, then, it just has a very specific audience.\nA cost-cutting EV\nWhen ordered, this particular 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning Pro started at $47,780 for the 240 mile version intended for commercial customers. Add $6,500 more for the largest, 131 kWh battery; $1,200 for Pro Power Onboard 9.6 kW; $1,100 for the Max Trailer Tow package; $430 for a tailgate that folds down into a work surface and has an integrated step and fold out handle; and $595 for the spray-in bedliner.\nA Ford-branded charging cord is $600, and a spare wheel (remember those?) is $175. Throw in a destination charge of $2,195 and you arrive at the final price of $60,575 for commercial buyers. Currently, the same truck starts at $49,780 before destination, and matching this configuration lands slightly higher overall, at $62,430.\nFord sells the Pro to retail customers, but not with the smallest battery. The cheapest retail version is $54,780 with the 128 kWh (300 mile) battery, $6,500 more for the largest battery with the fastest Level 2 charging. To match this overall spec, though, you're looking at about the same total price.\nThe least expensive Rivian might have a little bit more in the creature comforts department than the Lightning, but it also starts at $70,990 and it's pretty easy to inflate that price to six-figures with the right options. Other trucks, like the GMC Sierra EV, have no issue with high price tags either. The base-model Lightning also has the $55,000 commercial use Silverado EV beat on price, at least for non-retail buyers (though to be fair to the Silverado, it does have much more range).\n2025 Ford F-150 Lightning Pro Verdict\nIf I had any qualms about the Lightning in this Pro form, I would say that the options list is a little incongruous. It has gloss-black wheels standard, when steel wheels (or at least wheels that look like steel wheels) would fit the work vibe a little bit better. It also could have benefitted from a bench seat in the front.\nThe 12-inch infotainment screen feels incongruous with the rest of the barebones interior. I also think Ford should extend the cost saving options like vinyl seats/floor to the \"civilian\" F-150 Lightning lineup, which has a base price of $63,345 for the XLT with the smallest, 98 kWh battery.\nThe 2025 Ford F-150 really is not only a great EV \u2014 maybe one of my favorites this year \u2014 but it's a great truck in general. It's fun to drive, the interior is as functional as it needs to be, and it has power where it counts. What's not to like?"
