  "description": "Looking for the best way to unlock a world of media online with the best VPN for Android TV? This guide is all you need.",
  "content": "Have you ever been eager to watch a newly released movie on Netflix, only to find it unavailable in your region? More often than not, countless movies and TV shows are accessible on OTT platforms in other countries but remain blocked in yours. These restrictions are the result of geo-blocks imposed by content providers and distributors due to licensing agreements. While there are workarounds, many of them offer poor connectivity and slow data transfer speeds, leading to a frustrating streaming experience. That\u2019s why using a VPN is the most reliable way to bypass geo-restrictions and stream content safely on Android TV.\n\nAs you may know, VPNs route your internet traffic through secure servers, hiding your IP address and encrypting your data. This ensures a safer, more anonymous online experience. Beyond security, VPNs give you access to content libraries that would otherwise remain hidden simply because of your geographic location.\n\nIf you\u2019re ready to unlock these digital barriers and enjoy streaming any content on your Android TV, no matter where you are, read on as we explore the best VPNs for Android TV in 2025.\n\nHow Do You Connect a VPN to an Android TV?\n\nConnecting a VPN to an Android TV isn\u2019t too different from hooking up to a VPN on your computer or a mobile device. However, since VPNs aren\u2019t too often used on Android TVs, finding step-by-step instructions can be a challenge.\n\nDon\u2019t worry\u2014we\u2019ve got you covered. We\u2019ll walk you through the process of connecting a VPN to your Android TV. Let\u2019s use NordVPN as an example, and we\u2019ll give you the whole scoop on how it works on the big screen.\n\nTo check if VPNs work on Android TV, we searched for a TV show called \u2018Grantchester\u2019 on Prime Video from India, but it didn\u2019t show up in the results.\n\nStart by creating a NordVPN account, but you\u2019ll have to do this from your computer or mobile device. It works on Android TV, Android and iOS, several desktop platforms, browsers, and Amazon Fire TV, too. It is also one of the best VPNs for routers, which would practically make your entire network secure.\n\nFurthermore, NordVPN is the most recommended VPN for Android TV, allowing you to connect up to 10 devices simultaneously.\n\nInstall the VPN App on your Android TV\n\nAfter getting your hands on a NordVPN subscription, look up the NordVPN app using the Search feature or Voice Assistant on your Android TV. If you have access to the Google Play Store, you can easily find and install the NordVPN app.\n\nIf you\u2019re having trouble locating the Play Store, don\u2019t worry. It is sometimes hidden in newer Android TVs. To access it, open the browser on your Android TV, visit NordVPN\u2019s official website for Android TV to download the APK and install it manually.\n\nSet Up the VPN on your Android TV\n\nOnce you have successfully installed the app, follow the below steps to set up NordVPN on Android TV:\n\n1. When you open the app, you\u2019ll see the main menu. Now select Log in and enter your credentials.\n\n2. After selecting Log in, you will receive a numeric code. On your phone or computer, go to the NordVPN remote validation page and enter the number. You can also manually fill in the details.\n\n3. Once you sign in, you will see a few messages. Click OK on each to proceed. On the home screen, select Connect Now to connect to the best server automatically. If you prefer, you can also choose a specific server by selecting a country from the All Countries.\n\nAfter successfully setting up NordVPN on Android TV and connecting to a US server, we searched for \u201cGrantchester\u201d. This time, we were able to see it pop up on the screen as NordVPN successfully bypassed the geo-block.\n\nThis is proof that the best VPN compatible with Android TV can help you change your location on Prime Video, all without leaving your home.\n\nBest VPNs for Android TV in 2025\n\nAfter testing numerous VPNs on Android TV, we discovered that many fall short of expectations. The biggest letdowns were services that claimed full compatibility but, once installed, frequently suffered from stability issues and unexpected connection drops.\n\nIf you\u2019re considering a VPN for your Android TV, it\u2019s important to choose carefully. Most VPNs are not fully optimized for the big screen, and free options often carry risks that outweigh any benefits. Streaming platforms are also becoming more adept at detecting VPN usage, so only the top-tier providers reliably bypass geo-restrictions.\n\nTo save you time and frustration, we\u2019ve curated a list of the best VPNs for Android TV, allowing you to enjoy secure, uninterrupted streaming with confidence.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a reliable VPN that has been around for a while, NordVPN is sure to top the list. Based in Panama, it operates outside the jurisdiction of international surveillance alliances, ensuring your online activities remain private.\n\nNordVPN has developed its own NordLynx protocol, which is built around WireGuard technology. This protocol enhances speed and security so you can stream high-definition content safely. When put to the test, we found that the VPN caused only a speed drop of around 5% on our 1 Gbps network connection. This isn\u2019t too bad, considering we connected to the UK server thousands of miles away, and there was pretty much no buffering even when streaming HD content.\n\nWith over 8,000 servers in 126 countries, NordVPN offers fast, reliable access to geo-restricted content, especially on streaming platforms, making it the #1 rated VPN for Smart TV in2025. It also provides specialized servers for various needs, including P2P, Onion over VPN, Obfuscated, and Double VPN.\n\nNordVPN uses AES-256 encryption, one of the most robust security standards available, to keep your data safe from prying eyes, including your internet service provider (ISP).\n\nWhat we particularly liked about NordVPN\u2019s Android TV app is its SmartDNS feature, which bypasses geo-restrictions to access content from different regions without slowing down streaming.\n\nAdditionally, Threat Protection Lite is a handy feature that blocks ads and malicious sites. You also get features frequently used on PCs, such as Split tunneling and Custom DNS. When combined, they give you more control over how your internet traffic is routed and managed.\n\nNordVPN is a fine choice for Smart TVs and other devices that don\u2019t need the firepower of full-blown VPN apps. The setup is fairly easy, and the VPN runs invisibly in the background while you enjoy your favorite movies and TV shows. NordVPN\u2019s pricing starts at just over $3 per month, with a 30-day money-back guarantee and 10 simultaneous connections across multiple platforms.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for one of the best Android TV VPNs built for the big screen, ExpressVPN is a good choice. Based in the privacy-friendly British Virgin Islands, it operates under strict privacy laws and maintains a no-logs policy, so your online activities remain private.\n\nExpressVPN\u2019s network of over 3,000+ servers in 105 countries allows you to access content from virtually anywhere. Its RAM-only servers enhance privacy by temporarily storing data in memory, which is wiped clean upon restart, making it impossible for anyone to access your online activity.\n\nOne of ExpressVPN\u2019s standout features for Android TV is its Lightway protocol, designed to provide a perfect balance of speed and security. This ensures that your streaming experience is smooth, even when accessing content from regions with heavy restrictions. This explains why ExpressVPN is one of our favorite VPNs for Android in 2025.\n\nAnother key feature we liked about ExpressVPN is its Advanced protection, which includes blocking trackers, malicious sites, ads, and adult content. It also has Network protection that automatically cuts off internet access if the VPN connection drops, keeping your privacy and security intact.\n\nExpressVPN stops your ISP from throttling your connection so you can stream smoothly on your Android TV. You also get Split tunneling, which lets you control which apps use the VPN and which don\u2019t.\n\nExpressVPN costs about $4 per month and includes a 30-day money-back guarantee. The fact that it supports 10 simultaneous connections and is compatible with all major platforms makes it even more enticing.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for an affordable VPN with the necessary features to stream on Android TV without restrictions, PIA is a great choice. It has over 35,000 servers in more than 91 countries, offering extensive global coverage and making it easier to unblock websites that may be restricted otherwise.\n\nIn our experience, PIA was able to deliver a fast and reliable streaming experience on Android TV. The super-fast 10-Gbps server network takes the buffering out of the equation, so you can stream in 4K without any hiccups. The overall experience offers smooth and uninterrupted access to your favorite shows and movies. Additionally, PIA is able to bypass ISP throttling by effectively hiding your activity from your internet provider, so you don\u2019t have to worry about any slowdowns while streaming.\n\nPrivacy is a key strength of PIA, with its strict no-logs policy and AES 256-bit encryption. But the real advantage for Android TV users focused on streaming is its ability to consistently bypass geo-restrictions. PIA supports both OpenVPN and WireGuard protocols, so you can enjoy a stable and secure connection that doesn\u2019t dial down the speed.\n\nThe standout feature of PIA is its MACE tool, which reduces online ads and helps avoid malicious trackers, malware, and phishing scams. Additionally, with PIA, you can block access to your local network, preventing apps from potentially leaking your real IP address and hampering your privacy.\n\nPrivate Internet Access is easy on your wallet, starting at around $2 per month, and includes unlimited device connections. It is also compatible with all major platforms, such as Windows, MacOS, Android, and iOS. While it is limited in terms of features compared to the toppers on the list, it covers all the basics for a smooth streaming experience on your Android TV.\n\nIf you like to try something before you buy it, Proton VPN is a top-tier choice. Based in Switzerland, Proton VPN boasts robust privacy and security, with impressive speeds and server coverage, making it a top-tier option for streaming.\n\nProton VPN\u2019s premium plan comes with more than 6,200 servers, including fast 10 Gbps Plus servers in over 100 countries. This allows you to unblock geo-locked content and stream your favorite TV shows and movies without interruptions. The premium version also has DNS and IPv6 leak protection to keep your activities private when streaming.\n\nAnd just in case you want to enjoy freebies before you commit, there is a highly-rated free version of Proton VPN you can try out. When we tested out Proton VPN, the free version was just as secure as the paid version, which is why it is considered one of the best free VPNs for Android TV.\n\nHowever, there is a caveat\u2014the free plan works only with servers in five countries. This is an obvious problem for users who want to unblock content outside of the Netherlands, Japan, Romania, Poland, and the US.\n\nWhile we usually don\u2019t recommend free VPNs, Proton VPN\u2019s free plan clearly states its limitations. However, for full access and better performance, we recommend upgrading to a paid plan, starting at just $3 per month. The paid plan offers 10 device connections, better compatibility, and a 30-day money-back guarantee, making it a solid choice for Android TV users.\n\nEven though it\u2019s at the bottom of our ranking of the best VPNs for Android Smart TV in 2025, don\u2019t take Surfshark lightly. It has one of the best interfaces around and features designed for ease of use, keeping you secure. Despite being based in the Netherlands, which is part of the 9 Eyes Alliance, the company is committed to privacy with a strict no-log policy and advanced security features.\n\nWith over 3,200 servers in 100 countries, you can connect to servers worldwide and enjoy geographically locked content, regardless of the streaming platform you are using. It supports up to 10 Gbit ports, ensuring fast and reliable connections to enjoy 4K content on streaming platforms such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video.\n\nLike the others in this lineup, Surfshark prioritizes security, offering 256-bit encryption and modern protocols to safeguard your data. What really makes Surfshark stand out is its Kill Switch, a feature rarely found on Android TV, even among the top VPNs.\n\nApart from these, we personally loved Surfshark\u2019s NoBorders mode, which automatically detects when you\u2019re in a restrictive network. It then switches to servers that can bypass blocks, making it easier to stream content from anywhere, which is perfect if you are traveling and want to access your favorite media on the go.\n\nSurfshark is also powered by the Smart DNS feature, which revs up the streaming on Android TV by allowing you to access geo-restricted content without slowing down your connection. When combined with Surfshark\u2019s ability to bypass ISP throttling, this feature brings you a smooth and uninterrupted streaming experience.\n\nSurfshark offers budget-friendly plans starting at less than $3 per month, with a 30-day money-back guarantee on all subscriptions. It allows unlimited connections and supports multiple platforms, including browsers and Fire TV, making it a versatile and cost-effective choice for streaming.\n\nAndroid TVs offer one of the best streaming experiences, with all of your smartphone\u2019s features baked into a larger screen. But like the other media platforms, they also suffer from geographical restrictions when it comes to accessing content online.\n\nAs a result, the content available in streaming apps varies based on location, preventing users from enjoying an unfiltered media experience.\n\nTherefore, we recommend the best VPNs, specifically NordVPN, ExpressVPN, PIA, Proton VPN, and Surfshark, as they are compatible with Android TV and, most importantly, easy to install and use for fast, buffering-free streaming without those annoying geo-restrictions.\n\nChoose the VPN that fits your needs, and enjoy secure and unrestricted buffer-free streaming on your Android TV with any streaming app of your choice.\n\nWhy should I use a VPN on my Android TV?\n\nUsing a VPN on your Android TV allows you to bypass geo-restrictions imposed by content providers, giving you access to a broader range of shows and movies. Additionally, a VPN protects your privacy by encrypting your data and hiding your IP address, ensuring a secure and anonymous streaming experience.\n\nWhich VPNs are recommended for Android TV?\n\nSome of the best VPNs for Android TV include NordVPN, ExpressVPN, PIA, Proton VPN, and Surfshark. These VPNs offer reliable connections, robust security features, and the ability to unblock content from different regions.\n\nCan I use a free VPN on my Android TV?\n\nWhile some free VPNs are available, they often come with limitations and security risks. Free VPNs may have slower speeds and limited server options and may compromise your privacy by logging your data. For a secure and reliable streaming experience, it\u2019s recommended to use a paid VPN service.\n\nHow do I install a VPN on Android TV?\n\nMost top VPNs provide a dedicated Android TV app. You can install it directly from the Google Play Store on your TV. Alternatively, some VPNs can be installed via a router, allowing all devices connected to your network to benefit from the VPN.",

      "text": "If you\u2019re struggling with geo-blocks or firewall restrictions, you might be wondering how to unblock websites. Let\u2019s face it. We all deal with website blocks. They\u2019re annoying, discouraging, and downright unsolvable. At least at first. Luckily, no problem is unsolvable.\nYou see, you can unblock websites and access them no matter the circumstance. Sometimes, a website is blocked because of a geo-restriction. In other cases, a website block can be a result of law compliance, censorship, workplace/school policy, or something else entirely.\nThe best option to unblock websites in 2025 is with a VPN. However, this guide will review many other options that might be helpful. Let\u2019s go through them and see how they can help you overcome restrictions and have any site at your fingertips.\nUnblock Websites With a VPN: The Best Overall Solution\nHaving tried multiple methods (explained below), our team determined that using a VPN works the best. Not sure how a VPN works? Check out this guide. In short, this service lets you connect to an intermediary server located in another country.\nAs a result, your traffic is routed to that server, where you\u2019re assigned its IP address. With your IP address now changed, any website you visit will see that IP instead of the original one. This, in turn, lets you bypass geo-blocks and unblock websites promptly.\nWhile website blocks have different reasons explained later in the guide, most if not ALL of them can be resolved with an IP address change. This is why VPNs work so well. They can not only change your IP address but also provide additional security to prevent your IP address from leaking.\nThis is how many people access restricted gambling sites, Netflix catalogs, adult platforms, and much more. As this is the #1 method to unblock websites effectively, we\u2019ll explain how to use a VPN first, and then, we\u2019ll discuss alternative but less effective methods.\nBear in mind that VPNs work on all platforms and devices. The following guide won\u2019t apply only to PC users but also to those on iOS/Android phones, tablets, laptops, and even Smart TVs. This is, again, why VPNs work so well if you\u2019re struggling with site blocks.\nHow to Use a VPN to Unblock Sites?\nIn theory, all VPNs work the same but in practice, it\u2019s far from that. While all VPNs can unblock some sites, not all of them can unblock a whole lot. NordVPN seems to be the absolute best option in our experience.\nWhy? Well, it offers servers in 111 countries.\nIt\u2019s also a worthy site unblocker with special optimization for this purpose. It\u2019s no wonder many use it to binge on Netflix and BBC iPlayer and alleviate censorship. Coupled with top-tier security, strong privacy, unlimited bandwidth, and the fastest speeds, it\u2019s an amazing choice.\nHere\u2019s how to unblock a website you want with a VPN.\n1. Set Up a VPN Service\nSetting up a VPN is a major step. You\u2019ll need a subscription which you can get below. Click the button and you\u2019ll be taken straight to NordVPN\u2019s site. You can now pick a discounted 2-year plan at just over $3 a month or select any other deal you find suitable.\nClick the plan you want, enter your email, and pay using one of many payment methods. From here, you\u2019ll need to verify your account through the provided email, make a password, and download the VPN. Once that is done, install the VPN on your device.\nAfter signing in with your email and password, the VPN\u2019s dashboard will open.\n2. Connect to a Server\nYou\u2019ll need to connect to a server to unblock a website. For this scenario, we\u2019ll use the Australian TV channel called 10play. We\u2019re in Europe but 10play works exclusively in Australia. The same could be said about 9Now and other Australian TV channels.\nNevertheless, we\u2019ll need an IP adress from this country to access the channel. To get it, simply connect to the VPN server in Australia. Open the server list, find the country, click or tap once on it, and you\u2019re set. NordVPN\u2019s \u201cConnected\u201d message will appear up top.\n3. Visit the Website You Wanted\nAfter the connection is established, you can try to visit the inaccessible website and see if it now works. In our case, 10play worked like a charm, which can be seen in the screenshot below. We not only unblocked it but also watched many of its content.\nHowever, this is just one example of a foreign TV channel. You can use NordVPN to unblock websites with different content or even completely different types of websites. From gambling and betting to porn, streaming, and gaming platforms \u2013 you can access them all.\nIn many cases, connecting to a server in your own country will suffice. In fact, simply encrypting your internet traffic with a VPN allows you to unblock sites that are restricted by firewalls (whether in your school, office, etc.).\nOther Methods to Unblock a Website in 2025\nEverything comes at a cost, so if you don\u2019t want to pay for a VPN, does it mean you won\u2019t be able to unblock the site you want? Not necessarily. As explained, a VPN will work wonderfully but it costs money, although not a lot compared to paid proxy services.\nIf you can\u2019t pay for this service or you simply refuse to, we\u2019ll explore other solutions to access a blocked website.\nUsing a Proxy Service\nA popular method of unblocking a site is using a proxy. By this, we don\u2019t mean paid proxies like Bright Data, Oxylabs, and others. These are way too expensive and made for different purposes, one of which is scraping. We think mostly about open proxies like this:\nThis is Hide.me Proxy, a 100% free option that you can use without installation. Simply go to the website, select one of the three proxy locations, and input the domain address you want to visit. Click on Go and see if you can unblock the website you want.\nProxies are far different than VPNs, however. They don\u2019t have encryption and don\u2019t use tunneling like VPNs. Even worse, they\u2019re unoptimized for, let\u2019s say, unblocking streaming sites, and will only work in mild cases of censorship and school/workplace restrictions.\nBear in mind that schools and workplaces will often block proxy sites, making them unusable. In addition, proxies lack security features and free options (not Hide.me) tend to track your online activities and collect sensitive information about you.\nProxies can be extremely slow, displaying just a bare minimum of performance. Don\u2019t get your hopes up. Proxies can\u2019t always unblock websites, so in many instances, they simply won\u2019t work, making VPNs a superior option overall.\nAccess websites freely with NordVPN\nRouting Your Traffic Through Tor\nTor is a great and pretty much the only way to access the dark web. We explained how to go on the dark web in privacy and Tor Browser is an integral part. However, it can also be used as a website unblocked if the reason for blocking lies in IP blacklisting.\nTor functions by routing your connection through its many nodes or servers handled by volunteers worldwide. In this process, your IP address is hidden and the connection becomes encrypted. The entry node encrypts the connection and it is decrypted at the exit node.\nIf your IP address has been banned from the site, Tor will hide it and make the request to visit the website look like it originates from another machine. Tor, however, doesn\u2019t let you select the location like VPNs, so it\u2019s a poor option for geo-restrictions. It doesn\u2019t end there.\nThis browser is VERY slow because of the level of encryption and \u201cbouncing\u201d your traffic through multiple nodes. Not to mention it\u2019s not as \u201canonymous\u201d as it claims to be because its nodes can be compromised, in which case, you can be exposed.\nUsing an IP Address Instead of a Website URL\nHow to unblock websites without special software? Well, you can go for the very old trick and try to get on the site through its IP rather than the URL. Schools, workplaces, and other institutions can block only specific URLs but leave out IP addresses.\nThis is rather stupid on their side but it will let you capitalize on it by using the IP of the website. To clarify things, every website has its IP address, which is a unique sequence of numbers assigned to each website. The problem is how to find the IP address.\nWell, it\u2019s simple:\n- Open the Command Prompt on your computer (as an administrator)\n- Type in \u201cping\u201d and then enter the name of the website (example of a command \u201cping facebook.com\u201c).\n- Press Enter and the IP address of the website will appear.\nWith this IP address in your hands, copy and paste it into the browser window and see if you can unblock the site. There are other ways to detect an IP of the domain. macOS users will need to use the Terminal and the \u201ctraceroute\u201d command, for instance.\nLinux users can use the \u201cdig websitename.com\u201d command instead.\nClearing the Website Data (Works on Chrome)\nSome people want to know how to unblock websites on Chrome. The trick that they can perform is to clear the website data, which consequently works on Brave and other Chromium browsers. How does this help? It returns the site to its original state.\nThis, in turn, makes it as if you were visiting the site for the first time, wiping all cookies, cache, and other data accumulated in your device. To unblock a website on Chrome, you\u2019ll need to follow these few steps:\n- Open Google Chrome.\n- Go to Settings.\n- Click on \u201cPrivacy and Security\u201d and select \u201cSite Settings.\u201c\n- Go to \u201cView permissions and data stored across sites.\u201c\n- Find the website you want to unblock and click on the Trash icon next to it.\n- When the prompt appears, click \u201cDelete\u201d to remove all permissions and site data.\n- Go to the website now and see if it works.\nUnblocking websites on Chrome also works on its mobile versions, so you can follow this guide even if you aren\u2019t a PC user. We want to quickly mention that you can use a VPN for Chrome and not have to perform this solution. VPNs have their browser extensions.\nThey can be installed directly on the browser and help you unblock websites easily. NordVPN and ExpressVPN, in particular, have the best extensions that work like full-on VPNs and unblock websites the same way, helping you bypass even geo-restrictions.\nClearing the website data, unfortunately, works only on non-geo-blocked websites.\nTry Using Cached Versions of Websites\nIf you\u2019re trying to access a restricted domain without success, we suggest going for its cached version. This domain version is stored on Google\u2019s temporary storage. The solution is simple. Before you enter the URL, type in \u201ccached:\u201d and you\u2019re good to go.\nHere\u2019s an example; cached:www.facebook.com.\nAfter you enter the domain address this way, press Enter and it should work. As this is a cached version of the site, it might not work as the current version, so don\u2019t be shocked if it\u2019s slower, looks altered, or is missing some of its crucial elements.\nVisiting a Website Through Google Translate\nGoogle Translate is handy if you\u2019re having trouble with foreign languages but that\u2019s not all! This capable translator can help you unblock websites, which, at first, sounds silly. In practice, this solution works relatively well unless we\u2019re talking about, of course, geo-blocks.\nOpen Google Translate and type in the domain of the website in the left text box. In the Translation box, which is on the right, will appear the hyperlink of the domain. Click on it and you should be able to visit the website. It\u2019s far from perfect, though.\nThe website quality will be poor and you won\u2019t get the experience you want. We noticed that some websites display only text instead of their full page. Pages can be in disarray and missing elements, so links and buttons will not work.\nWe think this method of unblocking websites is useful only if you need to extract information from them. In some cases, seeing only text is enough to fetch the information you need and move on. If not\u2026 well, we go back to our VPN recommendation from before.\nWhy Are Websites Blocked?\nNothing happens without a good reason. This clever phrase can be applied to website blocks and restrictions that we frequently encounter. Let\u2019s explain the most typical reasons for not being able to access the website.\nGeo-Restrictions\nNot being able to use Netflix, BBC, Hotstar, and other streaming services comes as a result of geo-blocks. As the name implies, this means the website is restricted only to specific regions or one region, while the rest are not allowed to access it.\nHere\u2019s an example:\nThis happens because of licenses and copyright agreements that allow the site to operate only in specific regions. Netflix is a good example. It doesn\u2019t own all of its content and most belong to copyright holders. These companies decide where the content will be accessible.\nFor example, if a movie is owned by a company that doesn\u2019t want it broadcast to Germany, people in this country won\u2019t be able to watch it on Netflix. Netflix has its own \u201cOriginals\u201d that represent titles owned by the company and they\u2019re available worldwide.\nYou won\u2019t have to change your Netflix region to watch them. Geo-restrictions can ONLY be overcome with a VPN \u2013 no other solution works. They allow you to switch your IP to another location, pretend that you\u2019re there, and unblock websites that are region-locked.\nISP Blocking\nISPs have total control over your internet experience. They can use bandwidth throttling to deter you from gaming, torrenting, streaming, and so forth. In the same fashion, they can block websites to prevent bandwidth congestion and enforce their proprietary apps.\nFor example, ISPs offer their apps for streaming that you need to pay for. If you use Netflix, your money doesn\u2019t fill their pockets and they\u2019ll intentionally throttle all bandwidth spent on Netflix, making the streaming experience choppy and laggy.\nIn some cases, they can completely block websites and VoIP services. People use VPNs in the UAE to enjoy Skype, WhatsApp, Viber, and other free messaging apps for this reason.\nCensorship & Legal Reasons\nCensorship and legal reasons are often combined in many countries. China, Turkey, Russia, Belarus, and many other countries block websites that counter their political or religious beliefs. Censorship is a serious issue in 2025 and makes the internet extremely limited.\nChina blocks all Google services, social media, YouTube, and all mainstream sites, leaving you with nothing but crumbs. Some countries block porn, while others restrict access to anti-religious content found on some platforms. The same can happen in reverse.\nWebsites can use self-blocking in specific countries to adhere to legislation. That was the case with PornHub, which self-restricted access to its site to people in Texas. If you are in a country or state where the site is inaccessible, we recommend reading our selection of the best VPNs for Pornhub.\nSchool & Workplace Policies\nUnblocking websites at school and the workplace is often a primary interest for internet users. However, we understand that restricting certain sites is sensible. After all, you\u2019re at school to learn, not to juggle between Facebook and TikTok.\nConversely, your workplace should be a place to work and earn your keep and not have fun all the time. This is why gaming sites, social media platforms, and adult portals aren\u2019t allowed in these places. Schools and companies don\u2019t want you to be distracted \u2013 understandably.\nIf you ever need to access a site blocked by your school, feel free to check out our list of the best VPNs for school.\nIs It Legal to Unblock Websites?\nWhile a VPN and other tricks can help you access restricted sites, some wonder if this is the right call. We discussed the VPN legality in a separate guide where we explained that this service is usually legal in most countries. By most, we mean more than 90%.\nHowever, the legality of this service is valid unless you use it to perform illicit online activities. Downloading copyrighted torrents, despite the VPN\u2019s ability to conceal this activity, is still illegal. It\u2019s like murdering someone and not getting caught.\nThis still means you\u2019ve performed something you shouldn\u2019t. Unblocking websites at school, bypassing geo-blocks, and circumventing censorship are benign and usually won\u2019t get you in trouble. It will, however, go against certain policies and rules.\nNetflix has an anti-VPN policy that forbids the use of IP-changing tools to access its region-locked content. However, no one landed in jail for watching Netflix with a VPN. One thing to worry about is your country\u2019s legislation, which might differ if the country is more \u201cstrict.\u201d\nFor example, many countries deem gambling illegal, so if you unblock a website like Betfair or a random online casino, it\u2019s against the law. Many Muslim countries don\u2019t allow pornography, so again, watching PornHub there will be law-unfriendly.\nBefore you unblock a website of a sensitive nature (excluding Netflix and most streaming sites), inform yourself about your country\u2019s laws and legislation. If the site is illegal in your country, don\u2019t do it and fully respect the laws put in place. They\u2019re there for a reason!\nFinal Words\nDespite the type of website block, a VPN remains the most dependable option to get over it. This especially applies to geo-restrictions that can only be circumvented with a Virtual Private Network. Other restrictions can sometimes be remedied with alternatives.\nProxies can help you unblock websites at school, while Tor gives access to otherwise restricted Onion domains. Other methods might work for you as well but they\u2019re way less effective and aren\u2019t guaranteed to always work.\nAs for the VPN, we also gave you a few choices. NordVPN tops the list as the best overall option, but ExpressVPN and even Private Internet Access should fit the bill. Their large server networks can help you change your IP and unblock websites in seconds."

      "text": "A VPN installed on your Firestick is a major upgrade. We all know how powerful this tiny USB flash-drive-like device is. You plug it into any device with an HDMI port and turn it into a proper Smart TV with access to tons of streaming platforms. Sounds like a fairy tale! Well, in reality, it\u2019s not like that. While a Fire TV Stick lets you watch Hulu, MAX, Netflix, and other services, it\u2019s not always the case. These platforms are region-locked, so they won\u2019t work just anywhere. This is where the best VPN for Firestick comes into play.\nMost people install a VPN on their Amazon Fire TV Stick for streaming purposes. It lets you change your IP address, unblock the desired streaming services, and watch plentiful content. However, we must warn you that not all providers are optimized for streaming (these are).\nWorse yet, many of them don\u2019t even work on Amazon\u2019s little device. This list will circumvent such VPNs and focus on the cream of the crop. Don\u2019t worry. We tested them all, so we\u2019re not babbling nonsense based on someone else\u2019s experiences.\nThe 5 Best VPN Services for Amazon Fire TV Stick\nOur list contains 5 amazing options with features like:\n- Unlimited bandwidth for streaming\n- Fast speeds thanks to modern protocols\n- 10 Gbps server networks\n- Multiple simultaneous connections (7 to unlimited)\n- Netflix unblocking (up to 30+ catalogs), and many more\u2026\nWe\u2019ve focused on premium options to ensure we really give you the best-rated picks that you can enjoy without any limits. A separate list covers the best free VPNs for Firestick, but this one focuses on popular and capable providers, such as:\n7492 servers\n118 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n10 simultaneous connections\n9.4 /10\n3000 servers\n105 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n8 simultaneous connections\n9.1 /10\n6500 servers\n112 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n10 simultaneous connections\n8.8 /10\n3000 servers\n100 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\nUnlimited connections\n8.7 /10\n12000 servers\n100 covered countries\n45 days money-back guarantee\n7 simultaneous connections\n8.4 /10\n1. NordVPN\nPros\n- 6,400 servers in 111 countries\n- 300+ Mbps speeds\n- NordLynx VPN protocol\n- Natively supports Firestick\n- Uncapped bandwidth\n- Smart DNS\nCons\n- Rare connection issues on other systems (Windows/macOS)\n- Double VPN servers are slightly slower\nWon\u2019t settle for nothing but the #1-rated Firestick VPN? Here you go. NordVPN offers top-tier support for the Amazon Fire TV Stick, with a native app available for free through the Amazon Store. Once installed, you have access to over 6,400 servers in 111 countries!\nHaving tested this provider a thousand times, we can only sing praises about its performance. It works with a myriad of streaming services, including Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Hulu, MAX, Hotstar, and at least 20 or 30 more. Another perk is speed.\nNordVPN performs like a champ on all servers, with the speeds reaching well over 300 Mbps in our tests. This is more than enough to watch 4K movies and series without a hitch. NordVPN hits the speed mark thanks to NordLynx, a NordVPN-made VPN protocol.\nIt\u2019s a combination of WireGuard and NordVPN\u2019s technical prowess that resulted in the fastest man-made protocol in 2025. This VPN even includes Smart DNS, which can be set up for streaming on US-based platforms on older generations of Firestick.\nAs our favorite Fire Stick VPN, NordVPN is also unlimited. This means uncapped bandwidth on all devices. We appreciate its Meshnet support, which is often used for remote file sharing or even getting over the Netflix password-sharing ban. Handy for Firestick users!\nNordVPN\u2019s other features make this VPN worth your money. It includes Double VPN servers, a no-log policy, malware protection, AES-256 encryption, 10 simultaneous connections, and much more. See how to try NordVPN for free and obtain a 30-day free trial on our site.\n2. ExpressVPN\nPros\n- MediaStreamer works on all devices\n- Parental Control\n- Servers in 105 countries\n- Fast Lightway protocol for streaming\n- Built-in obfuscation\n- No-logging policy (18+ audits)\nCons\n- It lacks Double VPN connections\n- Not the cheapest Fire TV VPN\nExpressVPN is a leading choice on this list, bearing the title of the best VPN for Firestick along with NordVPN. We must commend its 3,000+ servers in 105 countries, all ready for the ultimate 10 Gbps performance. It\u2019s almost on the level of NordVPN performance-wise.\nIts average speeds were way over 250 Mbps in our tests, indicating a smooth streaming experience. Speaking of which, installing this provider\u2019s native VPN app on Firestick lets you access over 15 Netflix catalogs and foreign TV channels before you can say \u201cBBC.\u201d\nExpressVPN comes with tons of features to make you feel like a king. You\u2019ll enjoy its MediaStreamer, which consequently works on the 1st gen of Firestick. Moreover, there\u2019s a great ad blocker that also prevents trackers and malicious sites from doing you bad.\nThis great Amazon Fire TV VPN also offers Parental Control, which helps with blocking porn sites if you have children in your household. Above all, there\u2019s the Lightway protocol made by ExpressVPN to further accentuate raw performance and unrelenting speed.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that ExpressVPN has obfuscation, making it work in China. If you find yourself there, it\u2019s good to know you\u2019ll also enjoy added security in the form of a kill switch, AES-256 encryption, reliable DNS protection, and a no-log policy with multiple audits.\nExpressVPN is nearly ideal but it\u2019s a bit expensive compared to other best-rated VPNs for Fire TV Stick. Fortunately, you can drop the price additionally with 3 free months for the annual plan, thanks to which, the price slides down by 49% for superb savings.\n3. Proton VPN\nPros\n- One of the most secure VPNs for Firestick\n- Works with Prime Video, Netflix, and BBC iPlayer\n- NetShield ad blocker\n- It offers a free version with unlimited bandwidth\nCons\n- No Smart DNS support\n- Expensive Unlimited plans\n- Unimpressive speeds\nProton VPN is in many ways a powerhouse. For one, it\u2019s a VPN fully compatible with all Firestick generations (except the first). Second, it\u2019s very fast and offers over 6,600 servers in almost 115 countries. Third, its app is rich with streaming-optimized servers.\nLike CyberGhost, it can unblock Netflix and many other streaming portals, so you have ample performance for streaming. Proton VPN fares well against NordVPN security-wise but its speed is a tad slower even when using WireGuard. Still, it will be more than enough.\nThis VPN\u2019s Firestick app looks nice and there\u2019s a free version with limited streaming and only a handful of servers. Proton VPN also supports Onion Over VPN connections, which you can use outside this device if you want to get on the dark web through Tor.\nThe provider is based in Switzerland, so you also get security features like Secure Core and NetShield. The former ensures several encryption layers and untraceable connections. NetShield removes ads and trackers to aid your privacy and browsing quality.\nWhile it\u2019s one of the top-rated VPNs that work on Firestick, Proton VPN isn\u2019t flawless. Its lack of Smart DNS hurts compatibility with older Fire TV Stick generations \u2013 the first one, specifically. It can also be slightly expensive if you want other Proton\u2019s apps.\nIts 2-year plan, which should be the most affordable, is around $3.6 a month. The silver lining is its free plan with unlimited traffic and 8 server locations. Using it won\u2019t yield any streaming because of slow speed and a lack of streaming optimization, so don\u2019t jump in excitement.\n4. Surfshark\nPros\n- NoBorders mode\n- Works with over 30 Netflix libraries\n- Unlimited simultaneous connections\n- RAM-based servers\n- Intuitive apps\nCons\n- Not the best upload speeds\n- No antivirus in the cheapest plan\nSurfshark is perhaps the cheapest premium VPN for Fire TV in 2025. At the price of around $2.2 a month, its price-to-performance ratio is almost unbeatable. Best of all, it has a native Firestick VPN app downloadable for free on Amazon\u2019s website for good measure.\nWe found this provider to be one of the best for Netflix, as it can unblock over 30 libraries. Not only that but Surfshark\u2019s excellent performance is a pleasant surprise, with download speeds rivaling those of ExpressVPN \u2013 almost. Let\u2019s not forget how simple it is to use.\nA single click is all you need to connect to one of its 3,200 servers, all optimized for streaming. Surfshark takes pride in its NoBorders mode, which masks the VPN traffic and allows you to get over firewalls. If that\u2019s not enough, wait till you hear this!\nYou get unlimited simultaneous connections! This means you can protect ALL your devices and not pay a dime more. Surfshark\u2019s security is almost unbeatable, thanks to features like MultiHop, dedicated IP addresses, Private DNS, and even RAM servers.\nThe provider uses WireGuard for almost all connections, with the option to switch to OpenVPN if needed. A great add-on is its Antivirus, which works on computers and phones and cleans unwanted software to keep everything running smoothly.\nFire Stick VPN users prefer Surfshark\u2019s cheap price and easy-going 30-day refund policy that makes the provider risk-free. Surfshark is another safe provider with no logs, unlimited traffic, and all the other quirks we\u2019ve come to expect from serious premium VPNs for Fire TV.\n5. CyberGhost\nPros\n- Streaming-optimized servers\n- Great performance with WireGuard\n- Cheap 2-year plan with a 45-day refund policy\n- P2P servers on Windows/macOS\nCons\n- It doesn\u2019t have obfuscation\n- 7 simultaneous connections\nCyberGhost delivers dedicated streaming servers across all supported platforms. Rest assured, you\u2019ll find them in this exquisite Firestick VPN app as well. From here, you can promptly access Netflix US, ABC, Hotstar, or any other platform you want.\nUnlike Private Internet Access reviewed not long ago, CyberGhost has a native app for Fire OS. Another advantage is the WireGuard protocol whose implementation made CyberGhost much faster overall, fully utilizing the power of the 10 Gbps servers in 100 countries.\nWe like CyberGhost\u2019s many improvements that make the experience awesome. For instance, it offers Smart DNS but not with only US DNS addresses. Instead, you\u2019ll find them in Germany, the Netherlands, and Japan to further help you access their local TV channels.\nThe VPN offers the Security Suite, which works well on a computer. It includes a mighty antivirus and a tool used for updating your apps and keeping them invulnerable to threats. CyberGhost also offers torrenting servers, alas, only on Windows and macOS.\nBeing one of the best Firestick VPNs, the VPN sports unlimited bandwidth. You\u2019ll also find its security features impressive if that\u2019s your concern. CyberGhost\u2019s no-log policy has been audited by Deloitte and it uses RAM-based servers to prevent further data accumulation.\nCyberGhost\u2019s low price is accompanied by a 45-day money-back guarantee for users\u2019 satisfaction. However, you must know it lacks things like obfuscation and MultiHop, plus, it comes with just 7 simultaneous connections, which won\u2019t suffice for some users.\nHow to Set Up a VPN on Firestick?\nThe beauty of Fire TV Stick is its simplicity. Once you plug it into your monitor or TV, you can start downloading apps from the Amazon Store and extending your Firestick\u2019s capabilities. Let\u2019s see how to set up a VPN on Fire TV Stick and connect to it.\nGetting a Subscription\nYou\u2019ll first want to subscribe to a service from our list. We have 5 of them \u2013 all are great, so pick one and go with it. We recommend NordVPN as one of the most affordable premium providers for Firestick, with a 60% to 70% discount for 2-year plans.\nClick the button above, visit its site, and select the plan that suits you the most. After that, enter your email address and provide a payment method you\u2019ll use. With the payment done, go to your mail client, open NordVPN\u2019s email, and confirm your account.\nDuring this step, you\u2019ll also create a secure password to be able to use the app later on. This step is the easiest on either your phone or computer, so you don\u2019t necessarily need to perform it on the Firestick device.\nInstalling a VPN\nBefore using the service, you must download it. Don\u2019t forget to plug your Firestick into the TV/monitor. Now boot it up and go to the Amazon Store.\nSearch for the provider you\u2019ve subscribed to. It\u2019s NordVPN in our case. It should be at the top of search results.\nSelect that provider and then press \u201cDownload.\u201d After a minute or two, it\u2019ll be ready to use and you can find it in your apps or simply run it directly from the Amazon Store. Open the app and sign in with your email and password.\nConnecting to a Server\nAll that\u2019s left is to enjoy the fruit of your labor. Whether you want a VPN for BBC, Netflix, or something else, you need to connect to a server. Open the server list, select the country, and use the connection button to connect. You\u2019ll see a clear signal when you\u2019re connected.\nAfter that, you can go online, watch Netflix movies, or even stream MotoGP races on numerous free channels. We\u2019ll let you do your thing.\nIs a VPN for Firestick Necessary? Why Use It?\nOpenly speaking, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary if you\u2019re in a, let\u2019s say \u201cstreaming-friendly\u201d region. What does that mean? A good example is the USA, in which you\u2019ll find the majority of popular streaming services that offer the best content.\nHowever, you must know that geo-blocks are all around us, which means even US residents can be denied access to certain websites. Geo-blocks are easily remedied by one of our best VPNs for Firestick thanks to their ability to change the user\u2019s IP address to another country.\nSome users will find it almost necessary to use a VPN on their Fire TV device. If you live in the Balkans like some of our members, you\u2019ll find it impossible to watch Hulu, MAX, ABC, ESPN, and many other streaming platforms. The only solution is \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 a VPN.\nApart from streaming, you\u2019ll find many other VPN-related advantages. These providers offer additional security and privacy so that you\u2019re untrackable by your ISP. As they also work on other devices, you can use them to play games online and avoid DDoS, for example.\nA notable benefit is torrenting, which is extremely unsafe without hiding your IP. NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and other providers can conceal your IP address and prevent snoopers from interfering. Changing your IP unblocks other sites \u2013 not just streaming ones.\nThis is why many people manage to access foreign gambling sites or even bypass censorship in China. If you need a VPN on Firestick only, advantages like streaming, security, privacy, and ISP throttling prevention will be more than evident in the first hour of use.\nDo VPNs Work on Older Generations of Firestick?\nThe initial Fire TV Stick was released in 2014 and it\u2019s the only VPN-unfriendly one. The second generation from late 2015 and the third from 2017 will work perfectly fine. Of course, using the Fire TV Stick 4K Max (released in 2021) with a VPN is also possible.\nIf you\u2019re stuck with the first generation from 2014, you might be wondering if there\u2019s a way to set up some of our recommended VPNs for Fire TV Stick. Well, there\u2019s surely no direct way because of how \u201cweak\u201d its hardware is and its lack of VPN support.\nYou can, however, go for a workaround in the form of Smart DNS.\nSmart DNS Implementation\nSmart DNS is available in 4 out of 5 providers on our list \u2013 the last one being the exception. It\u2019s a streaming addon that lets you unblock services like Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu, and a few more without setting up a Virtual Private Network.\nThe reason it works on most devices is because it relies on DNS addresses. Every internet-capable device can take advantage of different DNS settings, which is what we want in this case. Smart DNS isn\u2019t as effective as a reputable VPN for Firestick.\nWhile it will unblock plenty of content, it usually doesn\u2019t offer many locations outside the USA. If you already have one of our top picks \u2013 NordVPN, for example \u2013 you can use its Smart DNS addresses. Here\u2019s how to do it.\n- Go to NordVPN\u2019s website and log in.\n- Under \u201cServices\u201c, select \u201cNordVPN.\u201d\n- Find \u201cSmartDNS\u201d and press \u201cEnable.\u201d\n- When prompted again, press \u201cActivate SmartDNS\u201d and wait for around 10 minutes for the process to complete.\n- Once it\u2019s activated, go back to the same page and you\u2019ll see two Smart DNS addresses.\n- Write them down on a piece of paper or screenshot them.\nFrom here, boot up your 1st gen Fire TV Stick and do the following:\n- Go to Settings and press Network.\n- Find your network and open its properties.\n- Navigate to DNS settings and type in the addresses from above.\n- Confirm your settings and exit.\nWith Smart DNS from NordVPN, you can access the majority of American streaming services, including Fox Now, HBO Now, Peacock TV, Netflix US, Amazon Prime US, ABC Go, and a few more. The process is pretty much identical for other providers on this list.\nUsing a Router\nAnother option is to install a VPN on a router. It\u2019s a good idea if you have a VPN-compatible router, in which case, the setup is a 5-minute process. If not, you\u2019ll have to flash your router firmware, install the new one, and then set up a VPN for Firestick.\nThe problem with this method is that most people have never tried it. This yields the risk factor of bricking your router and losing your warranty. VPNs have done a tremendous job of simplifying the process thanks to step-by-step instructions on their sites.\nSince they support different models and firmware, it\u2019s hard to give a definitive guide on how to do this. The best course of action is to visit the provider\u2019s website, look for its router support, and find a guide for your router model if it\u2019s supported.\nFollowing the steps is simple after that, and once it\u2019s done, connecting your old Firestick to the router is even simpler. This will let you directly take advantage of a VPN and stream ample geo-restricted content without buying a newer generation of this device.\nConclusion\nWe\u2019ve laid out our ranking of the best and most trusted VPNs for Firestick in 2025. If you\u2019ve been too lazy to read everything, we crowned NordVPN as the #1-rated option, with ExpressVPN following closely. These two should be your go-to choices.\nAfter that, we put Surfshark as an affordable provider with plentiful servers and unlimited simultaneous connections on a budget. CyberGhost\u2019s budget nature is more than welcome too, especially with its streaming-optimized servers usable on Firestick.\nProton VPN took the fifth spot. A remarkable Fire TV VPN but with expensive prices and the lack of Smart DNS. The choice is obvious to us. However, we\u2019ll let you decide based on your preferences and needs. Don\u2019t say 5 top-tier options are insufficient."

Unfortunately, many residents are blissfully unaware that they\u2019re exposing themselves and need a VPN for the UK to counter the rising levels of cyber threats.\nThe benefits extend beyond security. While Freedom House highly rates the United Kingdom for internet freedom, there are constant concerns over the government\u2019s extensive surveillance practices.

Let\u2019s get down to it.\n7492 servers\n118 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n10 simultaneous connections\n9.4 /10\n3000 servers\n105 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n8 simultaneous connections\n9.1 /10\n27000 servers\n91 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\nUnlimited connections\n9 /10\n3000 servers\n100 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\nUnlimited connections\n8.7 /10\n12000 servers\n100 covered countries\n45 days money-back guarantee\n7 simultaneous connections\n8.4 /10\n1. NordVPN \u2013 Best VPN in the UK in 2025\nWidely considered the best VPN on the market, NordVPN is our top choice in the UK for several reasons. For one, it offers a vast network with over 6,400 servers in 111 countries. More than 440 of those are distributed across Edinburg, London, Manchester, and Glasgow.\nThe provider\u2019s speeds are pretty impressive. Thanks to 10 Gbps servers, a well-optimized network, and a performance-friendly custom protocol, you can expect stable connections for streaming, downloads, gaming, and torrenting.\nDedicated servers for the latter help you download and seed quickly and securely.\nWhat\u2019s more, NordVPN is the best VPN service for streaming, as it effortlessly circumvents geo-blocks on websites and streaming services, including Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video.\nFrequent independent audits of its no-logs policy and RAM-only servers have proven you can trust NordVPN to wipe your digital tracks. Military-grade encryption prevents snoops and cyber criminals from deciphering what you\u2019re doing online. Also, it offers a kill switch, DNS leak protection, and advanced tools like obfuscation and Onion over VPN.\nIt also offers several extras that aren\u2019t exactly common, such as encrypted cloud storage, a password manager, cyber insurance for businesses, dedicated IP, and a dark net monitor. Some are standalone products bundled with the VPN for an extra fee.\nOne NordVPN subscription covers up to ten of your devices simultaneously \u2014 you can spread the protection across your computer, smartphone, streaming devices, router, and more. You get a 30-day money-back guarantee, allowing you to try the best VPN for the United Kingdom risk-free.\nPros\n- Hundreds of UK servers\n- Blazing-fast connection speeds\n- Audited no-logs policy\n- Unblocks local and international online platforms\n- Feature-rich service\n- Servers in 111 countries\nCons\n- Customer support cannot be reached by phone\n- No GUI for Linux\n2. ExpressVPN \u2013 Best UK VPN for security\nExpressVPN is one of the most trusted VPNs among British citizens and travelers. It packs over 3,000 servers dotted across 105 countries, with a decent chunk of that collection in five United Kingdom locations.\nThey are next-gen 10 Gbps servers, which usually means buffer-less and lag-less connections.\nExpressVPN doesn\u2019t shy away from broadcasting its unblocking capabilities \u2014 and we\u2019ve found they aren\u2019t just empty claims. Looking to unlock foreign content on sites like Netflix, Hulu, or Amazon Prime Video? Just connect to a server in the appropriate country.\nAnd when you travel abroad, you can easily access BBC iPlayer, ITVX, and other home-based platforms. Do you understand better why we consider it an excellent UK VPN?\nA strict, no-logs policy demonstrates an unwavering commitment to safeguarding your online presence and sessions. The VPN has racked up third-party audits over the years, even verifying its pace-setting TrustedServer technology. It scrambles your data with highly secure AES 256-bit encryption and comes with a kill switch, IP/DNS leak protection, and an ad and malicious site blocker.\nThe provider wraps all its offerings in a lightweight package you\u2019ll find easy to use. It\u2019s compatible with Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and several other platforms. According to our tests, it offers one of the best VPN applications for Apple TV.\nThe pricing may not be as attractive for some people (although the service quality justifies it), but there\u2019s a 30-day money-back guarantee to let you test what you\u2019re paying for. Not impressed? You can claim a full refund.\nPros\n- Several UK server locations\n- Fast connection speeds\n- Audited no-logs policy\n- Unblocks websites and streaming services\n- Well-designed, intuitive user interface\n- 24/7 client support\nCons\n- Expensive subscription pricing\n- No 2 or 3-year plans\n3. Private Internet Access \u2013 Cheapest VPN in the United Kingdom\nNeed a VPN that combines a feature-rich service with a truly massive network of servers in the UK and around the world? You can\u2019t go wrong with Private Internet Access. No other provider comes close to its network of over 30,000 servers in 91 countries, including locations in London, Manchester, and Southampton.\nThere\u2019s also a dedicated UK location optimized for buffer-free streaming. That said, PIA doesn\u2019t always provide the fastest connection speeds. We experienced the smoothest connections while using WireGuard ahead of the OpenVPN protocol. Also, with so many servers to choose from and helpful ping labels, you can bypass congested servers.\nIn addition, the provider helps you unblock various geo-restricted websites and online services, including Netflix US and UK libraries. However, it\u2019s not on the same level as NordVPN and ExpressVPN in this area.\nPIA labels itself a no logs VPN and means it. Despite its US (also a Five Eyes country) headquarters, it uses RAM-based servers that automatically wipe your online sessions. Plus, its privacy policy has undergone audits and even came out unexploited from a court process.\nAs for security and privacy features, it comes loaded with them. For example, the VPN employs bank-level encryption. It also has a customizable kill switch, leak protection, split tunneling, and Multi-Hop.\nPrivate Internet Access offers incredibly good value for your money, with low prices (making it the most affordable VPN in the UK) and the removal of an upper limit for connected devices. There\u2019s a 30-day money-back guarantee in case you change your mind.\nPros\n- Massive global network of servers\n- Audited no-logs policy and open-source VPN apps\n- Budget-friendly pricing\n- Feature-rich service\n- Unlimited simultaneous device connections\nCons\n- US jurisdiction\n- Inconsistent connection speeds\n4. Surfshark \u2013 Best for ease of use\nSurfshark is a budget VPN for the UK that delivers in terms of reliability and functionality. With over 3,200 servers in 100 countries, it has 212 servers in the UK. Like NordVPN, they are in London, Manchester, Glasgow, and Edinburg.\nAccording to our tests with Surfshark, you can expect decent connection speeds, especially while using WireGuard. We could stream online videos smoothly during our tests while connected to one of its London servers, even outside the country. It\u2019s not quite in NordVPN territory, though.\nIn addition, the VPN circumvents geo-blocks pretty effectively. Your subscription lets you access restricted content libraries on services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. We also tested it on BBC iPlayer and did not encounter any issues.\nSurfshark implements AES 256-bit encryption and comes with a kill switch, DNS leak protection, obfuscated servers, and Double VPN. The provider keeps its service log-free, not collecting any information it (or other parties) can use to know what you\u2019re doing online.\nIt also includes a few extras that can come in handy. There\u2019s CleanWeb, an ad-blocker that works pretty impressively. Surfshark\u2019s Alternative ID feature is novel in a VPN. It can generate a virtual online identity and email for you, effectively keeping your real identity under wraps. It\u2019s a great way to bypass the UK government\u2019s surveillance measures.\nLike Private Internet Access, your Surfshark subscription can protect your entire household, no matter how many devices are involved. You can try the provider\u2019s features with no strings attached for 30 days. If you\u2019re unsatisfied, you get your money back.\nPros\n- Budget-friendly pricing\n- 200+ UK -based servers\n- Unlimited simultaneous device connections\n- Audited no-logs policy\nCons\n- Netherlands (14 Eyes member) jurisdiction\n- Buggy app launch\n5. CyberGhost \u2013 Excellent value for money\nCyberGhost makes it into our list of the best VPNs for the UK, and for good reason. PIA aside, it has the most extensive network on this list, offering 12,000 servers in 100 countries. The United Kingdom hosts the provider\u2019s servers in London, Manchester, and Berkshire.\nCyberGhost offers optimized streaming, gaming, and torrenting servers, which makes it an excellent choice if you\u2019re heavily into those activities.\nThe streaming category includes dedicated options for services like Netflix UK, BBC iPlayer, ITV, Amazon Prime UK, Sky, and Channel 4. They help you securely access those British platforms from outside the UK, with speedier connections in the bargain.\nCyberGhost\u2019s no-logs policy keeps your browsing private, so UK security agencies and companies can\u2019t get their hands on your data. Even if they insist, its RAM-based servers wipe all information on them when they reboot anyway.\nThe AES 256-bit algorithm encrypts your data, and the VPN\u2019s automatic Wi-Fi protection feature safeguards your connections against lurking nasties on public networks. CyberGhost also comes with a kill switch to prevent your data from leaking whenever the VPN connection drops.\nCyberGhost\u2019s apps are well-designed and user-friendly. You can enjoy VPN coverage on up to seven devices simultaneously, which is above the industry average (but lower than most top VPNs allow these days). Monthly plans have a 14-day money-back guarantee attached, with that limit increasing to 45 days for users on longer-term plans.\nPros\n- Attractive long-term pricing\n- Optimized streaming servers for UK platforms\n- 45-day money-back guarantee\n- Verified no-logs policy\nCons\n- Expensive monthly pricing\n- 14-day refund policy for the monthly plan\n- \u201cOnly\u201d seven simultaneous connections\nWhy You Need a VPN in the United Kingdom\nThe UK is a member of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, a group of nations that collect and share vast amounts of surveillance data. Plus, its Investigatory Powers Act introduced \u201cextreme spying laws\u201d and came into effect in 2016 (despite a petition with over 130,000 signatures against it).\nWhat does this mean for you? While the apparent motive may be national security, these measures allow the government to snoop on your online activities and location data \u2014 even if you\u2019ve not done anything wrong.\nThat\u2019s where a VPN comes in. It encrypts your internet traffic and creates a secure tunnel between your device and the internet, so your data is unreadable. Essentially, that changes your IP address and shields everything you do online from any prying eyes \u2014 including government agencies.\nThere are other reasons for requiring a UK VPN service in 2025:\n- Cyberthreats: Hackers and other cybercriminals are not letting up, with the threat costing billions of pounds each year. A VPN protects sensitive information from prying eyes and potential theft.\n- Bypassing Geo-Blocks: Do you ever crave a show that\u2019s only available on Netflix US? Or BBC iPlayer when you\u2019re abroad? A VPN unlocks access to restricted websites and online services wherever you are.\n- Faster Connections: Sounds counter-intuitive considering the extra steps it adds to your connection, but a VPN can boost your connection speed when your ISP slows it down due to heavy data usage.\n- Wiping Your Tracks: A quality VPN\u2019s no-logs policy means you can research sensitive content or avoid targeted advertising.\n- Save Money Shopping: Prices (from airlines to digital products) can vary depending on location. A VPN helps you find better deals than you can from where you are.\nHow We Selected the Best VPNs for the UK\nSome research should go into selecting the right VPN for you in the UK. That is, if you\u2019re interested in a reliable service, anyway.\nBut with so many providers available, it\u2019s easy to land a dud. So, we did the heavy lifting, tested scores of VPNs, and ranked the top options based on our criteria. Here\u2019s what we watched out for:\n- Privacy and Security: We looked for VPNs with robust encryption, top-notch features, and a strict no-logs policy to ensure your data remains confidential and untraceable.\n- Server Network and Locations: A wider server network means more options for bypassing geo-restrictions and accessing content from different regions. To make this list, each VPN had to have thousands of servers globally, including many in the United Kingdom.\n- Speed and Performance: A VPN shouldn\u2019t significantly slow down your internet connection. We prioritized VPNs with fast speeds for browsing, streaming, and other activities.\n- Device Compatibility: The best UK VPN should work seamlessly on your devices through native support or manual configurations.\n- Ease of Use: We went with VPNs with user-friendly interfaces and intuitive apps. Even newbies won\u2019t face steep learning curves.\n- Customer Support: These providers offer reliable and responsive customer support 24/7 in case you encounter any issues with their service.\n- Money-Back Guarantee: You won\u2019t lose your money if you\u2019re not impressed, as each service offers a full refund window (usually 30 days).\nWhat About a Free VPN for the UK?\nCan you trust a free VPN to shield your online presence from the UK government\u2019s surveillance activities and cyber threats? We don\u2019t recommend doing so, especially since many lack top-level features and extensively log your online sessions for profit.\nBesides, they are typically pretty limited. Many free VPNs have tiny networks (sometimes to force you to upgrade), which leads to congestion and snail-slow connection speeds. Data caps and bandwidth limits are also common, both of which can be frustrating.\nFree VPNs certainly have their allure, but is saving a few pounds a month worth the difference in quality? Short answer: no. Unless you\u2019re only interested in light browsing or are using one as a last resort, you\u2019re better off using a premium VPN, especially if it\u2019s listed above.\nConclusion\nGoing online without protection in the United Kingdom comes with various risks, from government monitoring to hackers looking to steal your personal information. Plus, you have to put up with geo-restrictions when you try to view foreign content.\nA quality VPN service effectively handles those issues \u2014 so we\u2019ve listed several excellent VPNs for the UK. In our experience, NordVPN is the best option in 2025. It comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee, which is enough time to test it and make up your mind.\nFAQs about using a VPN in the UK\nIf you still have questions, we suggest you read on.\nWhat is the best VPN to use in the United Kingdom?\nNordVPN is the best overall UK VPN. It has hundreds of servers in the country, offers blazing-fast connection speeds, effortlessly unblocks content, and all but guarantees your online safety and privacy.\nAre VPNs legal in the UK?\nYes, VPN services are completely legal in the United Kingdom. The government has no laws restricting their usage, and there are no signs that it\u2019s interested in making one. However, breaking existing laws while using a VPN may land you in trouble.\nWhat VPN changes location to UK?\nAny VPN provider with servers in the UK can change your virtual location to that country. That includes all the providers on our list. To do this, they encrypt your online traffic and reroute it to a remote server in a UK location. Your actual IP address is masked, and your device gets a new temporary British IP address."

      "text": "Imagine how convenient it is to use some of the best VPNs on your router. Connecting all your devices to a VPN-enabled router means protection for all of them. Additionally, such a router ensures privacy for all incoming and outbound traffic, including that of your small devices.\nAs a result, you\u2019re creating a shrouded network with the highest level of privacy, safe from ISPs, snoopers, and hackers. Be aware that not all VPN services are compatible with routers, especially those that are free of charge. They\u2019re limited and lack many features you\u2019ll find in premium choices.\nToday\u2019s list will consist of premium picks you\u2019ll enjoy fully. We ensured they support all popular router models and even offer options to buy VPN-compatible routers for added convenience. Read on to discover some of the most impressive VPNs your money can buy!\nBest VPNs to Use on Routers in 2025\nWe\u2019ll begin our guide with the most important thing \u2014 the list of our favorite providers. After testing probably dozens, our team was confident these five are the most befitting according to their performance, security, privacy, and much more:\n- NordVPN \u2014 the best router VPN overall\n- ExpressVPN \u2014 great for high-speed connections\n- Private Internet Access \u2014 ultimate privacy for all your devices\n- Surfshark \u2014 budget-friendly router VPN, with top-tier security and encryption\n- CyberGhost \u2014 great for streaming, torrenting, and no-lag gaming\nNow that you have the list, feel free to use it right away. If not, we suggest going through our opinions on each router VPN, where we explain their most vital features.\n1. NordVPN\nPros\n- Works on 15+ router firmware\n- VPN-ready routers can be bought from the site\n- NordLynx and OpenVPN protocols\n- Unblocks Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Prime Video, Hulu\u2026\n- Obfuscation for bypassing censorship\n- 7,800+ servers globally\nCons\n- No support for Verizon and Xfinity\n- Infrequent connection problems\nNordVPN takes the #1 spot as the clear winner. It\u2019s not just the best VPN for routers, but a fantastic package overall. This service supports a wide range of firmware, including DD-WRT, AsusWRT Merlin, pfSense, OpenWRT, Tomato, Sabai, and many more.\nAdditionally, it is compatible with popular router manufacturers, including Asus, Netgear, and MikroTik, among others, which will likely result in native compatibility with your router. To accompany its versatility, NordVPN lets you buy VPN-ready routers directly from its site.\nThese devices already have NordVPN installed and are ready to use with its modern NordLynx protocol right away. Best of all, we found that these routers support up to 30 simultaneous connections, which is ideal for larger families or groups of friends.\nApart from this vast compatibility, NordVPN offers many additional qualities, as explained in our review. You\u2019ll enjoy bank-grade encryption, Double VPN servers, and even built-in obfuscation to help you bypass censorship. Another perk is the performance!\nNordVPN performs like Usain Bolt, with 10 Gbps servers in 118 countries. It\u2019s also the fastest provider for routers, making it perfect for gaming or watching 4K Netflix series. More impressively, users can enjoy Meshnet, which offers extensive file-sharing features.\nAccompanied by a no-log policy, RAM-only servers, and Threat Protection Pro for blocking ads and trackers, NordVPN is a state-of-the-art router VPN for all users. We say for all users because it\u2019s very affordable and offers a 30-day refund policy if you change your mind.\n2. ExpressVPN\nPros\n- Affordable Aircove routers\n- Intuitive app dashboard\n- Very reliable kill switch\n- Fast speeds\n- Great for streaming\n- No-logging policy\nCons\n- Not the most wallet-friendly provider\n- It doesn\u2019t support MultiHop\nLike our #1-rated VPN for routers, ExpressVPN supports a wide range of models and firmware. This amazing router VPN is compatible with firmware from Asus, Linksys, and Netgear. However, users can also opt for a manual setup on DD-WRT, D-Link, Netduma, Tomato, and Sabai models.\nWe love ExpressVPN\u2019s Aircove routers, which the company has recently started offering. These WiFi 6 routers offer built-in VPN protection, eliminating the need for manual setup. Purchase the model you want, subscribe to ExpressVPN risk-free, and enjoy.\nThe best thing about ExpressVPN is its ease of use. You can control your routers through a simple dashboard where you can engage with many of its features. For example, you can enable Network Lock, a kill switch, to protect your devices against IP leaks.\nIn addition, users can take advantage of ExpressVPN\u2019s Advanced Protection. It\u2019s ideal for blocking pesky websites, trackers, and ads. We love ExpressVPN\u2019s proprietary Lightway Turbo protocol, which offers impeccable performance aided by over 3,000 10 Gbps servers.\nExpressVPN is secure enough to satisfy even the most advanced users. With a no-logging policy, AES encryption, Private DNS, and over 18 security audits, you can be sure this VPN is a bulwark of privacy. Best of all, it\u2019s excellent for other activities, such as streaming and peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing.\nThis means it can unblock Netflix and conceal your torrenting activities from your ISP or other government bodies. ExpressVPN requires a bit of extra money compared to the best VPN for routers (NordVPN) but there\u2019s a 61% discount (+ 4 free months) to make up for it.\n3. Private Internet Access\nPros\n- Support for ASUS WRT, pfSense, and DD-WRT\n- Unlimited simultaneous connections\n- It offers ad-blocking abilities\n- Smart DNS is easy to use for streaming\n- Affordable price for its 2-year plan\nCons\n- It could be slightly faster\n- No app for Firestick\n- Based in the USA (5 Eyes)\nPrivate Internet Access is a highly reliable VPN compatible with many routers. However, it also offers unlimited simultaneous connections, making its router setup a bit unnecessary. If you\u2019d still like to use it, you\u2019ll be happy to hear about its compatibility.\nIt\u2019s not as great as NordVPN, but you can still install it on Merlin, ASUS WRT, pfSense, OpenWRT/LEDE, and DD-WRT firmware. If your router is unsupported, flashing its firmware is an option; however, you should only do this if you\u2019re tech-savvy.\nPIA\u2019s appeal lies in its security and privacy. Although it is a VPN based in the USA, it doesn\u2019t store any logs and utilizes the strongest 256-bit encryption. We must mention its WireGuard support, which works flawlessly in this router VPN and ensures excellent performance.\nPrivate Internet Access does many things right, including MultiHop connections, ad-blocking, and obfuscation. Installing this VPN on a router yields the benefit of anonymous torrenting plus the option to watch American Netflix and BBC on all your devices.\nUnlike NordVPN and ExpressVPN, PIA doesn\u2019t let you buy a VPN-ready router. However, if you already have a compatible model, you likely don\u2019t need a new one. Private Internet Access\u2019s obvious quality is impeccable device support, which, sadly, only excludes the Firestick.\nOn the brighter side, you\u2019ll get other commodities like dedicated IP addresses, Smart DNS, and even antivirus at just $1/mo. PIA\u2019s prices are remarkably modest, and at just over $2 a month for the 2-year plan, it isn\u2019t easy to find a more impressive choice.\n4. Surfshark\nPros\n- It works with over 30 Netflix catalogs\n- QNAP, pfSense, and Synology NAS support\n- MultiHop (customizable entry/exit servers)\n- Antivirus adds to device protection\nCons\n- Occasional kill switch problems in the past\n- Costly monthly plans\n- Linksys setup requires router flashing\nOr is it? We have Surfshark as a strong contender for the best VPN for routers. This provider has all you need, including simultaneous connections, top-tier WireGuard implementation, and a no-logging policy audited by Deloitte and Cure53.\nWhen it comes to router support, Surfshark has an extensive list. It includes OPNsense, Tomato, Keenetic, Asus Merlin, Freebox, pfSense, Synology NAS, QNAP, MikroTik, and many others. Most of these models rely on OpenVPN, but WireGuard is also a viable option.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Surfshark requires firmware flashing on Linksys routers, while others work perfectly fine. For WireGuard, we recommend using either OpenWRT or DD-WRT software, as they provide full support and offer fast VPN speeds. So far, so good.\nBut let\u2019s move to better stuff. Surfshark is powerful enough for streaming. Protecting all your devices means you\u2019ll also be able to watch over 30 Netflix libraries. Its desktop and mobile apps also include bonus features, such as static IP addresses and MultiHop for added security.\nSurfshark\u2019s One plan offers improvements such as antivirus protection and Search Features. The former removes threats from all your devices, while the latter is a true incognito browser for searching without ISP monitoring. Surfshark also includes basic VPN features.\nThese include split tunneling, a kill switch, IP leak protection, and many more. Following in the PIA\u2019s footsteps, Surfshark keeps the price at bay and won\u2019t cost over $3 a month. That said, you don\u2019t have to spend a mini-fortune on the best VPN for routers in 2025.\n5. CyberGhost\nPros\n- Helpful router VPN setup guides\n- Dedicated servers for P2P and streaming\n- IPv6 leak protection in all subscriptions\n- 45-day money-back guarantee\nCons\n- No obfuscated servers\n- OpenVPN connections are slower\n- P2P servers aren\u2019t available on all devices\nCyberGhost boasts over 12,000 servers in 100 countries worldwide. It\u2019s a well-equipped VPN for routers, supporting Tomato, Raspberry Pi, Synology NAS, and many more. On its site, you\u2019ll find a heap of router VPN setup guides, so everything is simple.\nWe also appreciate that you can visit Flashrouters and find routers with CyberGhost pre-installed. Once you have one, you need to connect your devices to it (with a valid CyberGhost subscription) and enjoy all the security and privacy it provides.\nEven if you opt for the manual setup, CyberGhost will provide you with the necessary configuration files, which can be easily implemented afterward. CyberGhost\u2019s WireGuard support is welcome because it works with specific router models, allowing you to experience it in the best light.\nIn our test of CyberGhost, we praised it for its streaming and P2P capabilities. This will be particularly prevalent in this case, especially if you use multiple devices to go online. CyberGhost can also protect your IPv6 address against leaks, a feature some of its rivals lack.\nAdditionally, as one of the top VPNs for routers, it excels in privacy and security. It doesn\u2019t keep any traffic logs, which Deloitte confirmed in a recent audit. The provider offers optional extras, including dedicated IP addresses and Smart DNS, which is compatible with all devices.\nCyberGhost lacks obfuscated connections, so it\u2019s a poor choice in China. This is countered by a relatively affordable price for its 2-year plan, which includes a few free months. The service costs a small amount above $2 monthly and offers a substantial 45-day money-back guarantee. Excellent stuff!\nWhat to Look for in a Router-Compatible VPN?\nLet\u2019s face it. Most people need a VPN for their iPhone, Windows computer, or any other \u201ctypical\u201d device. Very few users will bother to install a VPN on a router. Well, those who do will need to take into account a few important factors, such as:\nRouter Compatibility\nThe best VPN for routers can\u2019t be the one that doesn\u2019t support them. You want a provider that supports as many models as possible to ensure yours is on the list. We selected NordVPN and ExpressVPN as the two leading providers because of this criterion.\nThese two work on a variety of routers, and in addition, offer the option of buying a router with a preinstalled VPN. This might cost a tad more at first, but you\u2019ll rid yourself of the manual setup, which, if you\u2019re inexperienced, you might not know how to perform.\nProtocol Support\nIn addition to sheer compatibility, it\u2019s also beneficial to consider protocols. Our favorite picks offer modern protocols that work with routers. NordVPN\u2019s NordLynx works seamlessly with most models, and so does ExpressVPN\u2019s Lightway, which significantly enhances security.\nWireGuard in the rest of the VPNs is no less awesome. Best of all, it works with the majority of firmware, including OpenVPN.\nConnection Speed\nConnection speed was one of our most important criteria. Some VPNs can degrade your performance, which is especially true for free options with slow 1 Gbps servers. These providers reach speeds of up to 300 Mbps in our tests, making them impressively fast.\nHowever, be aware that your router\u2019s connection speed also affects the overall connection speed. Some of them are optimized for speed but not coverage. Conversely, some prioritize coverage while limiting connection speed to 50-100 Mbps.\nSecurity Features\nLast but not least, you should always pick a provider with at least standard security features. We often mention the importance of a kill switch that disables all internet traffic if the VPN connection breaks to keep your IP private. What are the other features?\nSome of these features include AES-256-bit encryption, IP/DNS leak protection, RAM servers, Private DNS servers, MultiHop, no logging, and more. You won\u2019t be using a VPN on a router only.\nInstead, you\u2019ll also install it on your computer or phone, and these devices benefit from added security and privacy.\nHow to Install a VPN on a Router?\nThe setup phase is what bothers most users. Is it safe? How do you do it? These are just some of the questions.\nWe can answer the first question with a YES, as long as you\u2019re not flashing your router. Flashing your router\u2019s firmware isn\u2019t always a good idea if you\u2019re inexperienced.\nYou can brick the device, potentially voiding your warranty. The second question requires a bit more coverage because there are dozens of router manufacturers and hundreds, if not thousands, of models you can have. This is how the process looks roughly:\n- You first need to subscribe to a VPN service. NordVPN is our recommendation because of its extensive router support and impressive performance.\n- Next, go to your account and find the router configuration files. Download them.\n- Open the web browser and type in your router\u2019s IP address. Press Enter.\n- You\u2019ll now need to sign in to access the router\u2019s control panel. These credentials should be at the bottom or the back of your router. Provide them and sign in.\nThis is the base for a router VPN setup if the router you\u2019re using is VPN-friendly. You should be able to find the VPN section in the control panel and work your way from there. The process differs from that of DD-WRT and OpenWRT, making it challenging to provide a definitive guide.\nWe suggest reading this page from NordVPN to find out more about the setup process for at least 10 different firmware versions. Simply find your router/firmware, click on it, and you\u2019ll get step-by-step instructions with images on how to install this great VPN on your router.\nBear in mind that if your router isn\u2019t VPN-friendly, you\u2019ll first need to flash it. After this is done\u2014hopefully with success\u2014you can proceed with the instructions on your selected provider\u2019s website.\nWhy Use a VPN on Your Router?\nThe question of why to use a VPN is typical for people with no experience with them. However, you might be wondering what kind of specific benefits you can get by installing a VPN on your router. Lots of them are there, but we listed the most prominent ones.\nSecurity for All Devices\nBy far, the best benefit is security for ALL your devices. Think about this. Instead of connecting to a VPN on each device individually, you can just connect to a VPN-enabled router and call it a day. This makes things so much simpler!\nSince all devices in your home are already hooked up to the router wirelessly, all of them will have added security and privacy. Think about your washing machine or boiler. These devices can be connected to the network and ALSO protected by a VPN \u2014 sounds silly, but it\u2019s true.\nThat said, if you worry about leaking your browsing history or any internet activity to the public, using the best VPN for routers is a blessing. With every device connected to it, there\u2019s no chance your ISP can track you or your online footprints.\nSafe Torrenting and Streaming\nAll five providers we presented are fully compatible with P2P. A simple connection to one of their many servers offers anonymous torrenting, which many users desire. This is especially welcome in the USA, where torrenting activities are often frowned upon.\nStreaming is another huge factor for many. You can use this service to bypass geo-blocks and unblock restricted sites in a blink. This allows access to sites like BBC iPlayer, Netflix, Hulu, or even gambling sites and adult platforms. Again, this will apply to all devices.\nAs a result, your family can watch one movie on Netflix US while you, in your room, can watch something else at the same time simply by connecting to a VPN router.\nGaming With No ISP Throttling\nISP throttling spoils the fun by trumping your speed and destroying your connection stability. Don\u2019t ask us how we know it! Well, we\u2019re glad the torture can be cut short with a VPN that eliminates your ISP from the equation and prevents it from harming you.\nOnce your connection is encrypted, your ISP can\u2019t track or limit you in any way. This allows you to enjoy the full speed of our favorite VPNs (up to 300+ Mbps in our tests), which is ideal for gaming. It\u2019s even better if you have a gaming router with neck-breaking speeds.\nThat, in itself, is a joy for multi-player gaming sessions combined with the safety of a VPN.\nBypassing Censorship\nWe must address bypassing censorship because many people struggle with it. Blocked websites and the lack of freedom of speech already sound infuriating. If you\u2019re feeling nauseated by just thinking of them, a router VPN can help you in many ways.\nIts ability to hide your IP address and obfuscate your traffic effectively counters deep-packet inspection. NordVPN, ExpressVPN, and Surfshark are your best picks in this regard, especially if you\u2019re in China. These will work flawlessly thanks to built-in obfuscation.\nSummary\nIn summary, the top VPNs for routers are NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Private Internet Access (PIA), Surfshark, and CyberGhost. If you want the most juice out of your squeeze, consider NordVPN as the end-all-be-all solution for privacy, security, speed, and stability.\nExpressVPN costs a bit extra but provides excellent Advanced Protection, the Lightway Turbo protocol, and exclusive access to its powerful Aircove routers. PIA\u2019s compatibility isn\u2019t impressive, but that can\u2019t be said about its privacy and unlimited simultaneous connections.\nSurfshark\u2019s affordability makes it an attractive option for users who prioritize unique security features, robust streaming capabilities, and dedicated IP addresses. Finally, we have CyberGhost, which works fine on all popular router firmware and costs less than a cup of coffee per month.\nRouter VPN FAQ\nWe\u2019re not done yet! Let us quench your thirst for more information by answering your questions.\nIs it safe to install a VPN on my router?\nIt is. The VPNs we presented have no security vulnerabilities and can be used without worry. If you have a router that requires a firmware update, it\u2019s another story, because if you\u2019re inexperienced, you can brick it and likely void your warranty. Apart from this minor inconvenience, there\u2019s nothing to be scared of.\nAre free VPNs usable on a router?\nSome of them are, but generally, free VPNs are never as good as paid VPNs. They lack pretty much everything. From speed and security to device compatibility, streaming prowess, torrenting allowance, customer support, etc. We\u2019d always choose a premium router VPN instead.\nIs it necessary to use a VPN on my router?\nGenerally speaking, VPNs are not always necessary, but they\u2019re beneficial for added privacy and security. Similarly, you don\u2019t need to install a VPN on your router if you don\u2019t want to. Instead, you can install it on your other devices because the setup is much simpler. It\u2019s your call."

      "text": "Isn\u2019t it strange that so many phone users seek the best VPN for Android? Apparently, it\u2019s not given that over 90% of users go online on their phone. While we can argue about Android\u2019s popularity against iOS, we know that at least 3.9 billion people use the former.\nThat\u2019s a lot of living souls in need of a reputable Android VPN app. This service offers a wealth of benefits for your privacy and security. It encrypts your traffic, anonymizes your online activities, and makes everything you do online private.\nAn even more popular advantage is bypassing website blocks. People use some of the best VPN apps for Android to watch Netflix or stream various sports events. The key aspect is to find a provider that fulfills all your needs because, sadly, many of them aren\u2019t so great.\nOur cybersecurity experts have done all the heavy lifting for you. We tested dozens of VPN services and narrowed our selection to just a few top choices for Android in 2025. Let\u2019s see what they offer and the benefits they provide.\nBest VPN Apps for Android Phones and Tablets\nThis guide will heavily lean into the premium VPN market. We have another guide where we present you with free VPNs for Android. Unfortunately, they\u2019re not as great, so they couldn\u2019t make it to our list.\nNow that we mentioned it, here\u2019s the list you wanted:\n- NordVPN \u2013 the #1 VPN app for Android devices\n- ExpressVPN \u2013 fast and stable VPN for Android\n- Private Internet Access \u2013 unlimited connections on a budget\n- Surfshark \u2013 Android VPN app packed with advanced features\n- CyberGhost \u2013 optimized for P2P and streaming\nLet\u2019s discuss each top pick separately to understand why it made our list.\n1. NordVPN\nPros\n- 6,400+ worldwide servers\n- Tapjacking Protection\n- Private DNS servers\n- Meshnet works on Android\n- Affordable price\nCons\n- No GPS override tool\n- It lacks discounts for monthly plans\nOur favorite pick, NordVPN, knows what it means to provide an equally amazing experience on all platforms. Its Android VPN app is filled with features to make you jump in excitement. Let\u2019s start with its servers \u2013 6,400+ in 111 countries. Now, these numbers are jaw-dropping.\nNordVPN also offers Double VPN servers. They double your encryption and prevent you from being tracked by government agencies and ISPs. This VPN app comes with special P2P servers, anonymizing torrenting on your Android phone in seconds.\nWe love this VPN for its performance. NordVPN has uncapped bandwidth and offers 10 Gbps servers. This is reinforced by its NordLynx protocol, which makes every connection smooth and suitable for heavy downloads and streaming on any platform.\nAndroid VPN users can enjoy watching ITV outside the UK or unblocking Netflix US. In addition, NordVPN has handy security features. They include AES-256 encryption, a reliable kill switch, and Threat Protection. The latter blocks malware and ads.\nInterestingly, NordVPN includes Meshnet on Android. It\u2019s suitable for remote control and access to other devices. A feature unique to this great VPN for Android is Tapjacking Protection, warning you if a malicious app tries to trick you into an unintended action.\nNordVPN uses its in-house DNS to handle your DNS requests. Better yet, it\u2019s protected by an ironclad zero-log policy to keep your online activities concealed.\nFinally, NordVPN offers a 7-day free trial for Android users.\n2. ExpressVPN\nPros\n- One of the fastest Android VPNs\n- Parental Control\n- Dozens of third-party security audits\n- It can unblock Netflix catalogs\n- Perfect Forward Secrecy\nCons\n- The least affordable VPN on the list\n- It doesn\u2019t have MultiHop/Double VPN servers\nExpressVPN takes the second place as yet another excellent VPN for Android phones and tablets. It offers a simple app that won\u2019t eat through your battery but still performs like a champ. After all, it\u2019s based on the Lightway protocol designed to churn out performance.\nExpressVPN is simultaneously one of the fastest VPNs you can use on Android. Moreover, its 3,000 servers are more than impressive for torrenting, streaming, or playing various mobile games. Its Android app is similar to the Windows app, so you get a premium experience.\nIts kill switch works reliably. Our team likes its Advanced Protection that blocks ads, malicious sites, trackers, and even adult sites. The app also includes split tunneling, which routes only specific apps through the VPN.\nBeing one of the most popular VPNs for Android, ExpressVPN includes something called Keys. It\u2019s a password manager, which users with a heap of passwords will appreciate. ExpressVPN\u2019s no-log policy underwent significant audits from third parties.\nIt\u2019s the most audited VPN in the industry, with successful evaluations from PwC, KPMG, Cure53, and other companies. It\u2019s almost at the top of our ranking of Android VPNs for inclusions like RAM servers, Private DNS, and Perfect Forward Secrecy for the highest privacy levels.\nSadly, ExpressVPN lacks Double VPN servers and has no abundance of very advanced features like NordVPN. Befitting to the title of a great Android VPN, ExpressVPN\u2019s price isn\u2019t the lowest. Don\u2019t worry, you still get a 7-day free trial as an Android user.\n3. Private Internet Access\nPros\n- Port Forwarding on Android\n- Obfuscation is included in mobile apps\n- Dedicated IP addresses\n- Unlimited simultaneous connections\n- Very affordable, at around $2/mo\nCons\n- Not the most reliable option for streaming\n- It doesn\u2019t have a free plan\n- No Firestick app\nThis US-based VPN has been with us for well over a decade. It perfected its formula, quickly becoming a go-to Android VPN for millions of users. Its enormous server fleet counts 30,000 servers and perhaps more. An even better thing to hear is this \u2013 unlimited connections.\nGiven its extremely low price, budget users will love that this VPN compatible with Android can protect all their devices! Private Internet Access comes crawling with features but also works with Netflix and allows you to play online games thanks to fast speeds.\nIt relies on WireGuard most of the time, including features like port forwarding, a kill switch, and PIA MACE to kick out all ads and trackers. Our favorite feature of this Android VPN app is Automation, as it lets you assign multiple auto-connection rules at a time.\nThis will ensure the VPN connects right away on certain actions to protect your privacy. Obfuscation is also available, so you can mask your VPN traffic and appear as a \u201cnormal\u201d person online. This feature is useful if you travel to China and other censored regions.\nPrivate Internet Access lets you get a dedicated IP address for conveniences like avoiding captcha puzzles or preventing IP bans. Windows users still get a few more features like SOCKS5 and Shadowsocks proxies but also an optional antivirus.\nThat\u2019s not an issue, as you can equip all your devices with PIA with one subscription. Private Internet Access has a gigantic discount that drops its price to just around $2/mo. To test it out without paying, you can take advantage of its 7-day free trial on Android as well.\n4. Surfshark\nPros\n- MultiHop servers\n- GPS Override function\n- Split tunneling\n- CleanWeb (ad blocker)\nCons\n- You have to pay more for its standout features\n- \u201cOnly\u201d 3,200 servers\n- Some issues with the kill switch in the past\nOne of the cheapest premium VPNs for Android on this list is simultaneously one of the best. Surfshark and its beautiful UI serve thousands of mobile users. This VPN skimps on nothing, so you still enjoy zero logging, superb 256-bit encryption, and MultiHop servers.\nWe just scratched the surface with these. Namely, Surfshark\u2019s Android VPN application is streaming-friendly, letting you access around 30 Netflix libraries. It\u2019s also a great iPhone VPN because it allows you to use WireGuard on all platforms to improve your connection speed.\nSurfshark\u2019s Android app offers CleanWeb, which effectively blocks ads and trackers. Moreover, it has two kill switches, one standard and the other Android-native, which disables internet traffic for split-tunneling-bypassed apps. Pretty useful.\nWe discovered that its app contains a GPS Override function, which allows for geo-spoofing. There\u2019s also the IP Rotator, which periodically rotates your IP while keeping your online location the same, and in the process, allowing for a constant connection.\nSurfshark\u2019s base version is very cheap but we recommend paying slightly more for the One plan. This plan packs useful extras, such as an antivirus that works directly on your phone and discovers threats. Its Search browser is also useful for anonymous browsing.\nSurfshark has upped its game significantly in 2025. It now offers dependable 10 Gbps servers in 100 countries, unlimited bandwidth, and 24/7 support for all your needs. Grab its discount below and enjoy this amazing premium VPN with a few free months on top.\n5. CyberGhost\nPros\n- Servers optimized for streaming\n- Intuitive and well-optimized Android VPN app\n- Dependable VPN kill switch\nCons\n- No obfuscation technology\n- 14-day refund policy for the monthly plan\n- Just 7 simultaneous connections\nOur recent CyberGhost review was very favorable, especially when discussing its mobile apps. It\u2019s on the list of the best VPNs for Android for its speed, security, privacy, and streaming/P2P optimization. This VPN has it all and is still priced modestly.\nHow so? We don\u2019t know. We can only discuss what we tested. CyberGhost\u2019s Android VPN application offers 12,000+ servers in 100 countries. Our favorites were streaming servers that we used to access MAX, BBC iPlayer, and numerous Netflix libraries.\nYou can expect standard security features here. A kill switch, 256-bit encryption, and all that stuff. Being a Romanian service, the VPN also keeps no logs and has an audit from Deloitte to prove that. While its Windows app is confusing, its mobile apps are impeccable.\nIt\u2019s easy to enable WireGuard and enjoy blazing-fast performance, for instance. Another thing we like is the kill switch, which safely disables your internet traffic if the VPN connection breaks. CyberGhost lacks obfuscation, which might be its biggest pitfall.\nThis means traveling to China won\u2019t be so enjoyable, as you can\u2019t get over censorship. CyberGhost\u2019s unlimited bandwidth surely tips the scale, and so does its immense focus on service quality, especially with bonus features like Smart DNS and dedicated IPs.\nDespite its 7 simultaneous connections, which is underwhelming, CyberGhost retains its position as one of the most affordable VPNs for Android in 2025. There\u2019s a 3-day free trial on Android plus a 45-day money-back guarantee for its dirt-cheap 24-month plan.\nHow to Install and Use a VPN on Android?\nWe always say how VPNs are so complex under the hood, yet so simple for the end user. You\u2019ll agree that installing an app on your phone is a no-brainer in 2025. That is unless you\u2019re a time traveler from centuries ago. We\u2019ll assume you\u2019re not.\nIf you\u2019re still unsure how to use a VPN on Android or even install it, here\u2019s an in-depth guide to help you out. The guide will cover all Android devices, including phones, tablets, and TVs.\n1. Subscribe to a VPN\nYou\u2019ll need to subscribe to one of the best VPNs for Android first. The overall best pick is NordVPN, so we\u2019ll use it for this guide. Rest assured, all VPNs work the same, with minor differences that shouldn\u2019t confuse you. Click the button below to go to its site.\nFrom here, select the plan you want. Again, we recommend any of the 2-year plans because they\u2019re discounted by more than 65%. Once you select the plan, enter your email address, pay for the subscription, and confirm your account via the mail NordVPN sent you.\n2. Install a VPN on Android\nEasy? This is even easier.\nYou need to install an Android VPN application now. You can download its APK from the VPN\u2019s site. However, we recommend going to Google Play, searching for the VPN you subscribed to, and downloading it.\nThis is simpler, as Google Play will automatically download and install the app for you. Once it\u2019s done, open the app and sign in with your email and password from Step 1. You\u2019ll be greeted by a dashboard that lets you enjoy the VPN from this moment.\n3. Connect to a Server\nAnd how do you enjoy a VPN? You connect to any of its servers! We\u2019ll leave this step to you. Pick any server you want and go online in complete privacy. For this guide, we used a random US VPN server but you can pick any for them in over 110 countries.\nAndroid VPN Benefits: Why Use This Service on Your Phone or Tablet?\nConnecting to a server seems quite simple to yield so many benefits. What\u2019s the deal with the best VPNs for Android? Why are they so popular? Let\u2019s explain everything in depth.\nPublic WiFi Security\nIf you\u2019re young and full of energy, we\u2019ll assume you\u2019re going out in restaurants and cafes. Little did you know that their public WiFi hotspots are insecure and often lack solid encryption, making them easy prey to hackers and snoopers.\nThink of a tiger vs penguin duel \u2013 that\u2019s how hackers can devour these networks. When doing so, they\u2019ll see all the IP addresses of connected users and be able to access their devices and steal data. Which data? Perhaps credit card information? Might be.\nThe trick is to somehow conceal your IP address and avoid such discrepancies. The best VPN for Android rears its head. Connect to one once you\u2019re on public WiFi, encrypt everything you do online, and let hackers smash their heads into the impenetrable 256-bit encryption.\nYou\u2019re fully secured this way and no one can steal any information or follow your online footsteps. That\u2019s the gist of it.\nImproved Privacy\nPrivacy is another focal point of our preferred VPN apps for Android. Through encryption and everything else, they prevent other \u201centities\u201d from spying on you. This is also done through a no-log policy, which means the VPN stores no data of your activities.\nLet\u2019s say someone breaches the VPN and tries to steal its data. If nothing is stored, nothing can be stolen! All 5 providers we recommend have audited no-logging policies and RAM-only servers that store ZERO information about your online whereabouts.\nEven if the CIA or NSA seizes their servers, they will come out empty-handed. If you don\u2019t believe us, do your research and read their audits from PwC, KPMG, Cure53, Deloitte, and other auditing firms. These reports will tell you everything you need to know.\nStreaming & P2P\nP2P isn\u2019t usually something you\u2019ll do on your phone. But you can. With a VPN. It\u2019s best to stay anonymous during torrenting to avoid ISPs, copyright trolls, and other snoopers. But what about streaming? You have plenty of things to discover on this end.\nGeo-restrictions plague our beautiful world. Some websites won\u2019t work in your country. Netflix works everywhere but its catalogs differ based on your location. This, again, calls for an Android VPN that could alter your online location and do some fancy trickery.\nIt\u2019ll trick any website you visit into believing you\u2019re in another country, allowing access promptly. This can be done on any website, not just Netflix. Some people use this to gamble online or unblock adult sites otherwise unavailable in their or foreign country.\nLag-Free Gaming\nOur best-rated VPNs for Android offer impeccable performance for playing games. We know Android gamers are plentiful and lagging or even DDoS attacks scare the living hell out of them. A VPN can aid your cause by removing ISP throttling, thereby, fixing a high ping.\nAs for DDoS attacks, it\u2019s clear how they work. Instead of attacking your IP address, an attacker will have to attack the VPN\u2019s IP instead because your original IP is hidden. This changes nothing because the VPN server is powerful enough to handle the punch.\nCheaper Travels\nWho doesn\u2019t love some summertime or wintertime travels? The more, the merrier! When they\u2019re cheaper because you\u2019ve used our best VPN for Android \u2013 that\u2019s a feast. Prices of flight tickets and hotel rentals often depend on your location.\nThey\u2019ll be more expensive in Germany than Bulgaria because the former is a more developed country. You can use this to prosper by altering your IP to a less-developed country and checking for flight ticket prices. Our experience shows that you can save a lot.\nSometimes it\u2019s hundreds of dollars annually, sometimes less. It all depends on how travel-happy you are.\nSome Famous Android VPN Apps to Avoid\nGoogle Play is more \u201cchaotic\u201d than the App Store, which is why many prefer a streamlined approach to apps and security on iOS. This brings with itself a nasty flow of unfiltered, specky apps that often happen to be VPNs.\nThese really free VPNs will happily provide you with unlimited bandwidth and lots of servers with one obscure condition \u2013 data collection. Such VPNs should be avoided at all costs. This isn\u2019t the only negative case. Free VPNs usually implement other annoyances.\nSome include in-app ads, limited bandwidth, and even intentionally slow speeds to force you to go the premium route. Our #1 advice is to AVOID all 100% free VPNs for Android that promise you everything on a silver platter. If you haven\u2019t heard of it, don\u2019t use it.\nApart from that, we\u2019ll also mention providers like:\n- Turbo VPN\n- Hola VPN\n- Betternet\n- Urban VPN\n- Ninja VPN\nAll of them are free, with fatal flaws like the ones we mentioned. These names surely sound familiar, especially Hola VPN which offers everything and stores even the tiniest private information, which sounds really scary. Let\u2019s be direct and tell this.\nYou should mostly avoid unverified free VPNs for Android. Freemium VPNs are another story, and as mentioned at the start, we have a list of them that you can check. But even they aren\u2019t as great as these five, which you\u2019ll realize the moment you start using them.\nSummary\nSo, what is the leading Android VPN in 2025? That must be NordVPN, closely followed by ExpressVPN.\nThese two are the best VPNs for Android with the leading reputation in security, privacy, performance, streaming, torrenting, and all other aspects.\nWe advise checking more budget solutions too. Private Internet Access and Surfshark are attractive for their unlimited connections, for example. CyberGhost, on the other side, relies on streaming servers to help you access more content on the fly.\nWith this ranking at its end, you have ample choices."

      "text": "Switzerland is known for its stringent privacy laws, making it one of the best legal jurisdictions for a VPN. In today\u2019s Proton VPN review for 2025, we\u2019re discussing one such provider. Proton VPN is renowned for its privacy-oriented nature and robust security.\nHowever, the provider made some significant improvements in the past few years. Apart from its obvious advantages, the VPN offers plenty of servers, great performance, streaming, torrenting, and many more. Does it make it comparable to some of the top names, though?\nBefore we move on to our in-depth Proton VPN review, we must admit that it is one of our favorite options. Its privacy is on par with the best options like NordVPN and ExpressVPN. Additionally, it offers a handy free VPN plan that will undoubtedly attract many users.\nOverall, Proton VPN seems like a complete package. This rings even truer considering its father company Proton which offers a few more security tidbits that you can get along with the VPN service. In today\u2019s Proton VPN analysis, we\u2019ll review its offerings and answer the question of whether you should buy and use it.\nProton VPN\nIf you need a mighty VPN with non-negotiable privacy and plenty of servers, Proton VPN might just scratch that itch. It's a solid service overall, ultimately let down by its average performance and inability to work in China.\nPros\n- Secure Core servers are incredibly safe\n- Open-source applications\n- 12,600 servers in 117+ countries\n- It can unblock Netflix US\n- Free plan with unlimited bandwidth\nCons\n- Proton VPN isn't working in China\n- Not the best speeds\nProton VPN Pricing: How Much Does It Cost?\nWe\u2019ll start this Proton VPN review on a, let\u2019s say, good note \u2013 its price. The service offers a great free plan that we\u2019ll mention later but it\u2019s primarily a premium provider.\nThe price you\u2019ll pay for it is worthy of the \u201cPremium\u201d badge too given the VPN\u2019s qualities we\u2019ll discuss later in this review. Here\u2019s how much it costs at the moment.\nLook at the so-called \u201cRecommended\u201d deal from Proton VPN. It\u2019s a 2-year plan that costs $3.59/mo. You\u2019ll be billed upfront around $86.11 for the first 24 months. Absurdly, the 12-month plan is dangerously close price-wise to the 24-month deal.\nAs you can see, it\u2019s just under $4 or around $48 for the first 12 months. The 24-month plan is very similar to NordVPN\u2019s equivalent which costs just over $3 a month. Yet, NordVPN is in many ways superior to Proton VPN, even security-wise.\nWe also must mention the renewal price, which is way higher. Once the initial deal expires, Proton VPN charges you around $80 a year, which is around $6.67/mo. This is an identical price to ExpressVPN\u2019s annual deal, which, as you can guess, is another superior service.\nLet\u2019s check out its business VPN plans. Proton doesn\u2019t only offer a VPN here. Users can enjoy its Mail & Calendar, Drive, and Pass. To translate, we\u2019re talking about an email service, cloud storage, and a password manager.\nThese three can be obtained along with the VPN in the Proton Unlimited subscription.\nIt\u2019s a bit costlier, though, and the VPN Essentials plan will cost you at least $6.99/mo, with the VPN Professional plan being a speck under ten bucks \u2014 $9.99/mo. In a bit, you\u2019ll find out if Proton VPN is worth the asking price based on our experience with it (spoiler alert: it is).\nMoney-Back Guarantee and Free Trial\nProton VPN offers a 30-day money-back guarantee for all plans, including the monthly one.\nThere\u2019s no free trial, however, so you must either buy it immediately or test it first using a free plan. Speaking of which, we mentioned it earlier in our Proton VPN review.\nThis plan offers unlimited traffic and is almost equally secure to the paid option. However, because you\u2019re paying nothing, some corners have been cut. Proton VPN doesn\u2019t let you pick the server location, so you\u2019re locked to one \u201cFastest\u201d server.\nHowever, it offers 5 countries \u2014 the US, the Netherlands, Japan, Poland, and Romania and automatically connects you to one of these based on your location.\nAnother issue is slow speed, which can ruin your day on many occasions. The free plan isn\u2019t streaming-optimized, it blocks P2P traffic and lacks features like Secure Core servers, Port Forwarding, NetShield, and others, all of which are mentioned in our test below.\nPayment Methods\nProton doesn\u2019t offer plentiful payment methods and we don\u2019t like that, although it has enough. You can pay using credit or debit cards and PayPal. For a VPN that prides itself on being a privacy giant, not offering crypto payments would be crazy. Luckily, it does.\nYou can, however, pay only with Bitcoin, but we won\u2019t be annoying nitpickers. Frankly, we use PayPal for our VPN purchases but if you\u2019re a privacy geek and want everything under control, you\u2019ll lament the lack of your beloved cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Dash, Monero, etc.\nEase of Use & Compatibility\nAfter trying out its apps, our team was pleasantly surprised with how capable they are. All Proton VPN\u2019s apps look stunning and grace us with their presence on all devices. The screenshot below shows you its Windows app, which looks modern and sleek.\nThe situation is the same with mobile apps that support one-tap connections and are snappy and quick. We must praise Proton VPN\u2019s support for Linux. It\u2019s the best VPN for Linux with a proper GUI, which lets even beginners use the service without issues.\nProton VPN\u2019s device compatibility is great overall and users can install it on:\n- Windows, macOS, and Linux computers and laptops\n- Android and iOS tablets and phones\n- Gaming consoles (PS, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, \u2026)\n- Routers (pfSense, AsusWRT, DD-WRT, FreshTomato, MikroTik, OpenWRT, Vilfo, \u2026)\n- TVs (Android Smart TV, Nvidia Shield TV, Firestick TV, Apple TV, Chromecast, \u2026)\nThe provider supports both OpenVPN and WireGuard on routers too. However, you need a WireGuard-friendly router in this case. Simultaneous connections are its forte and you\u2019ll find 10 of them in all plans, except for the free one that offers 1.\nCompared to CyberGhost, Proton VPN offers 3 more simultaneous connections but is on par with NordVPN. For more concurrent connections, you can use Private Internet Access or Surfshark. They offer no limits in this regard and even cost a bit less.\nSecurity Features of Proton VPN\nSo now, we move on to the Proton VPN review of security features. This, we believe, will be the most interesting part of our test. Our team has been with Proton VPN since its inception so we witnessed some interesting improvements in this field.\nWe love how the provider progressed and its trajectory is indeed going in the right direction. Here\u2019s what we think of its security features based on our first-hand experience.\nBasic VPN Features\nWhen it comes to basic features, Proton VPN is no slouch. Like its popular rivals, many of which we mentioned so far, it includes well-known features, such as:\n- 256-bit encryption. As you likely know, it\u2019s the most powerful encryption in the world. Being impenetrable by brute force, worldwide authorities and the military use it to keep their vital information confidential.\n- Automatic Kill Switch. A standard VPN feature that shuts down the internet if the VPN connection drops to prevent IP leaks. There\u2019s even the \u201cPermanent\u201d version which prevents you from going online unless you connect to a VPN. In our Proton VPN test, the kill switch worked well amidst very few connection problems we experienced.\n- NetShield. It\u2019s an ad blocker that also blocks malware and trackers. We deem it a basic feature because it\u2019s easily enabled and works in the background. Sadly, unlike NordVPN\u2019s Threat Protection Pro, we discovered that it doesn\u2019t display blocked threats, which is a shame.\n- DNS and IPv6 Leak Protection. It needs no special explanation. When enabled, these two prevent the leakage of your DNS and IPv6 addresses.\n- Split Tunneling. It allows you to exclude or allow the apps or IPs to use the VPN tunnel. During our test, we used this feature for local banking and shopping sites where we didn\u2019t need to change our IP address.\nAdvanced Security Features\nProton VPN isn\u2019t all about numbers features-wise. NordVPN and Private Internet Access offer more, for example. However, Proton VPN is far from being underwhelming and the advanced features it offers are paramount for online privacy. They include:\nSecure Core Servers\nSecure Core servers are the highlight of Proton VPN. They\u2019re quite similar to Double VPN or Multi-Hop, and in the same fashion, they route your traffic through multiple servers before it reaches the final destination. As a result, no one can trace the origin of the traffic.\nThese servers offer additional encryption, as expected, and because of that, they\u2019re a tad slower. In our Proton VPN test, the speed reduction wasn\u2019t very dramatic but indeed noticeable. However, this isn\u2019t the goal of Secure Core servers.\nThe goal is to get you online anonymously and without snoopers breathing behind your back. Secure Core servers are stationed in hardened data centers in Sweden, Iceland, and Switzerland. They\u2019re used in pairs with \u201cnormal\u201d servers to establish a connection.\nFor example, you can select the US server via Iceland, Sweden, or Switzerland. This means your traffic will be routed first through one country and then the other before it reaches the destination. With two IPs and double the encryption, you\u2019re basically a ghost online.\nWireGuard Protocol\nFrom our experience with Proton VPN, it works best when using WireGuard. However, the provider also has this Smart option, which automatically assigns you the protocol based on numerous parameters. In most cases, the provider will use WireGuard.\nAt least that was the case in our test. Some servers are more optimized for OpenVPN in which case, the service will opt for UDP or TCP. We noticed that UDP is slightly faster while TCP was great for overall reliability and sometimes bypassing firewalls.\nAlternative Routing (Stealth VPN on macOS)\nSince we mentioned firewalls, let\u2019s briefly talk about Alternative Routing. It\u2019s almost equivalent to Stealth VPN, which the VPN uses on macOS. In 2025, Proton VPN included an update where Stealth VPN now works on Windows, improving the service dramatically.\nAlternative Routing is your means of getting over firewall restrictions if you encounter blocking problems.\nThe main purpose is to get to Proton\u2019s sites if they\u2019re blocked but the provider claims it\u2019s also handy for general restrictions. We tested Alternative Routing in China but the results weren\u2019t so great. More about that near the end of our in-depth review of Proton VPN.\nWhat about Stealth VPN which now works on Windows and macOS? Again, it\u2019s not as great as you expect it to be, and while it does work in the case of many firewall restrictions, the Great Firewall will be an unbeatable obstacle.\nStealth VPN, however, masks your VPN connection and makes it look like a normal connection instead. It\u2019s handy if you are in school or the workplace and want to circumvent stubborn network restrictions. In this scenario, it works perfectly fine.\nDark Web Monitoring\nDark Web Monitoring isn\u2019t an in-app feature. It\u2019s instead found if you log in to your account from the website. You can, from here, enable Dark Web Monitoring with a simple click and protect your private information from public eye exposure.\nIt works the same as the Dark Web Monitor from NordVPN or Alert from Surfshark. If your private information is exposed, the Dark Web Monitor informs you, letting you take action by changing your credentials if the email or password is endangered.\nIn our test, the tool found nothing because we used a new email address that we usually don\u2019t associate with anything else than VPNs.\nPrivate DNS\nPrivate DNS servers are used by Proton VPN for added privacy. They handle your DNS requests and prevent third-party DNS services from seeing them. For added customization, the provider allows you to use a custom DNS server.\nHowever, after trying out a few, we can tell you from experience that Proton VPN\u2019s DNS is the best option. You have to really trust a specific DNS to use it and since most of them will track you in some way and store your sensitive data, this isn\u2019t the smartest option.\nAs you\u2019ll see soon in this Proton VPN review, the provider\u2019s no-logging policy is perfect, so you can be sure nothing is stored on its servers.\nPerfect Forward Secrecy\nForward Secrecy also known as Perfect Forward Secrecy or simply PFS, is another feature worth mentioning. Proton VPN prides itself on using this feature to protect you against data breaches by assigning unique encryption keys to each connection.\nOne connection with a specific encryption key will be unique, and once the connection is stopped, the encryption key is deleted and never used again. Even if the encryption key is compromised, which is impossible to happen, it would be useless, as a result.\nFull-Disk Encryption\nAs expected from a privacy-focused service, Proton VPN\u2019s server technology is impressive. Like other similar providers, it uses RAM to host its servers. Apart from that, the service went a step ahead to secure all of its servers with full-disk encryption!\nThis allows the provider to store config files and server certificates on the exit server to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. The attacker can\u2019t steal the server certificate and compromise the server as a result, making Proton VPN\u2019s servers \u201cbulletproof.\u201d\nThese servers aren\u2019t used in all countries. Instead, Proton VPN reserved them for high-risk countries with frequent data breaches and surveillance. For instance, one such country is Russia, where the authorities are notorious for anti-privacy practices.\nIP and DNS Leak Test Results: Ironclad Security\nAn integral part of our review of Proton VPN is an IP/DNS leak test. We performed quite a few, testing all 115+ countries that the VPN offers. For the sake of simplicity, we\u2019ll show you our test results with the US server, which were, by the way excellent.\nThe screenshot above shows us the first Proton VPN test, which was performed on ipleak.net, a famous IP/DNS Leak Tester. You can see only US IP addresses here and no trace of our native IP or DNS, which was in Europe at the time.\nUsing another website, browserleaks.net, yielded excellent results too. Once again, we faced no leaks, as Proton VPN effortlessly preserved our privacy and ensured much-needed anonymity expected from this company.\nDoes Proton VPN Keep Logs?\nWhen we discovered that Proton VPN doesn\u2019t store logs, we were all but surprised.\nAfter examining its background, the surprise factor dwindled further. We explained that the VPN is from Switzerland, a country with privacy laws so strong, that the authorities can\u2019t and won\u2019t impose logging obligations on the VPN services.\nInterestingly, another provider, PrivadoVPN, is also from this country.\nThis VPN is another no-log option with extremely strong privacy and security. So, this is no accident. Proton VPN\u2019s father company is Proton \u2014 again, a Swiss cybersecurity giant. More impressively, the provider\u2019s VPN apps are open-source, which adds to transparency.\nWe have three important factors \u2014 a Swiss jurisdiction, Proton, as a reputable company, and its open-source nature. All three are already screaming security and privacy, ensuring us that a VPN like this would never store logs. You\u2019d be a fool for not trusting this company.\nProton VPN\u2019s Privacy Policy Review\nThe first glance at the privacy policy gave us goosebumps. It\u2019s so short, yet so concise. The privacy policy states that Proton VPN doesn\u2019t keep any logs of your:\n- IP address\n- DNS requests\n- Visited websites\n- Traffic and communications\n- Session length\n- Location-based information\nLogging is extremely minimal and Proton VPN will store only the necessary data for the service to function. This data includes your email address and basic payment information, which must be familiar to the provider for it to work.\nProton VPN has proven its claims in 2019 in a legal case in which it was ordered to hand out the collected logs to identify a user. The company couldn\u2019t comply because it held no logs on its servers. Besides, let\u2019s not forget its open-source apps.\nCybersecurity experts can, if they want, examine all of them and get proof of the provider\u2019s security and privacy. However, we don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary given its outstanding reputation among people online.\nThird-Party Audits\nOur Proton VPN analysis of the privacy policy is nearly done \u2014 we have to mention its independent audits. In 2023, a famous auditor called Securitum audited the provider\u2019s no-logging policy. Securitum is, not to forget, founded by CERN scientists.\nThis is a well-respected company consisting of experts in the cybersecurity field. Earlier in 2020, the provider had another independent audit from SEC Consult on its apps for Windows, Android, macOS, and iOS. All four received praise from SEC Consult.\nFor all the reasons we have mentioned, Proton is an excellent no-logs VPN.\nProton VPN Review: Server Locations\nWith its server fleet constantly expanding, Proton VPN has arrived at quite an imposing number of around 12,600+ servers in 117+ countries. This server network is far larger than that of ExpressVPN, Surfshark, and even NordVPN, which is a commendable result.\nRegardless, this is one of the most impressive server parks we\u2019ve tested. Bear in mind that these are RAM-only 10 Gbps servers too. In addition, the server variety is impressive, as Proton VPN offers specialty servers for:\n- Streaming\n- P2P/Torrenting\n- Tor Over VPN\nThe latter are welcome for using Tor and venturing into the dark web, for instance. The former two are typical for premium providers such as CyberGhost or NordVPN. We mentioned Secure Core servers earlier and currently, there are 117 of them in 68 countries.\nAfter trying out the majority of server locations, we found that the server distribution is phenomenal. Namely, Proton VPN has nearly 3,200 servers in the US, which is considerably more than CyberGhost. Also, it offers locations in many censored regions.\nThey include Russia, the UAE, Turkey, India, and so forth. So even if you\u2019re a very demanding user, finding a server location that suits your needs will be pretty simple.\nSpeed Tests: Proton VPN\u2019s Performance Evaluation\nIt\u2019s time to divulge our speed test results in this Proton VPN review. We\u2019ll begin by displaying our native internet speed without using a VPN. At the time of testing, we\u2019re in Belgrade, and after evaluating our connection on Ookla\u2019s Speed Test website, we received these results:\nOur team tested Proton VPN for 3 days in a row, 3 times a day by connecting to 3 server locations \u2013 the UK, the USA, and Japan. We also used the Smart protocol option, which meant that the VPN would automatically decide on the protocol it\u2019ll use.\nAll speed tests were performed with the VPN Accelerator ON, which can be found in the app. However, it doesn\u2019t have a huge impact, as you see below. These are our best-case results from the extensive 72-hour test.\nUK Speed Test Results:\nUS Speed Test Results:\nJapan Speed Test Results:\nBased on our tests and overall experience, we\u2019re satisfied with the provider. Its speeds aren\u2019t the best compared to NordVPN and ExpressVPN. However, the speed reduction isn\u2019t extremely dramatic in most cases.\nWe\u2019ve had an anomaly where the US server was faster than the UK server despite the former being farther from us (screenshot #2). This happened in all tests, by the way.\n| UK Server | US Server | Japan Server | |\n| Download Speed Loss | 51.6% | 23.9% | 65% |\n| Upload Speed Loss | 6% | 41.1% | 17.5% |\nIn practice, Proton VPN performed well, with stable connections and a lag-free experience. It\u2019s not particularly great for gaming but if you value this trait, again, you\u2019ll want to use NordVPN instead. Glance at our NordVPN speed test results here.\nStreaming & Torrenting With Proton VPN: How Good is It?\nThe presence of streaming and torrenting-optimized servers reassures us that the provider will be reliable enough for these purposes. Starting with streaming, our team had a solid ride within this Proton VPN review. Netflix worked if that\u2019s your concern.\nWe unblocked catalogs from the US, Canada, Australia, and the UK, while the Japanese library was a bit problematic occasionally. Our experts tested other platforms, such as Hotstar, MAX, and BBC, all of which would work flawlessly. Pluto TV is in this group too, as can be seen in the screenshot below.\nBy working flawlessly, we don\u2019t mean just unblocking the streaming service. The experience, in terms of smoothness, is also great, with only occasional buffering that would disappear after 1-2 seconds. Torrenting support is vital for Proton VPN as a premium service.\nWith or without its Port Forwarding function, torrenting is a breeze. We used a server in Serbia and downloaded Linux Mint in no time. The speed reduction was hardly noticeable, except for upload speeds that dwindled a bit.\nThis, after all, isn\u2019t too important for torrenting for many of you. In general, Proton VPN can be compared to the top-rated VPNs in torrenting but not in streaming. NordVPN is again better, unblocking 30+ instead of a few Netflix libraries like this provider.\nUsing Proton VPN for Bypassing Censorship\nIt\u2019s that time for the Proton VPN review where we\u2019ll discuss the uselessness of this provider\u2019s anti-censorship features. We\u2019ve teased you a bit about it but now, it\u2019s official. After testing the VPN in China, our experts discovered that it wouldn\u2019t work.\nOn Windows, we used Alternative Routing to no avail. On macOS and Windows, we used Stealth VPN with the same results. We then found this article on its website:\nThis article confirms that it\u2019s not working, as the provider itself admits it. If you\u2019re in China or planning to travel there, this provider won\u2019t be great. Consider NordVPN and its obfuscated servers that work incredibly well in China at the time of testing.\nExpressVPN and Surfshark also work well based on our tests. For more information, we have a guide on using a VPN in China successfully. In that guide, we also present you with a few of the most dependable providers for this country.\nCustomer Support\nProton VPN\u2019s customer support isn\u2019t the best around. If you haven\u2019t bought it yet, you\u2019ll be locked to email support, which can be pretty slow to respond. Only customers are allowed to use 24/7 live chat support, and by customers, we of course mean paid customers.\nSo again, if you\u2019re a free user, live chat support is a no-go. This is in stark contrast to Hide.me which doesn\u2019t exclude 24/7 live chat support from its free users. Whatever the case, live chat support is okay but not impressive. It is helpful enough.\nOn its site, you\u2019ll find a wealth of guides in the Support Center. They will help you set up the VPN, unblock streaming services, get a refund if needed, troubleshoot issues, and so on. The provider is available on other platforms, such as Mastodon and Reddit.\nReddit users often communicate with Proton VPN\u2019s developers and troubleshoot their problems. We found that the provider is very talkative on Reddit and ready to help and answer many feature requests.\nConclusion\nAt the end of our Proton VPN review, we\u2019ll answer the question from the start. Is the provider worth your money and is it any good? The latter question is easy to tackle \u2014 it is very good, yes. But is it worth your money? Well, that\u2019s a complex conundrum.\nAs a whole, we think Proton VPN has a lot of amazing things going for it.\nIt performs decently, offers solid security, and comes with some of the best privacy features we\u2019ve seen so far. Coupled with a robust server fleet and a free subscription plan, it\u2019s hard to find something overly negative about the provider.\nA few years ago, Proton VPN\u2019s price was the main problem but with the discount in place, it\u2019s very affordable for many. Its 2-year plan is in the price range of NordVPN and perhaps Surfshark\u2019s mid-tier plan. Unfortunately for Proton VPN, these two cheap VPNs are better.\nEven NordVPN, our #1 rated service is often a tad cheaper while offering more. To its detriment, Proton VPN isn\u2019t working in China, isn\u2019t the most capable for streaming, and doesn\u2019t come with more powerful features like Threat Protection Pro or Meshnet from NordVPN.\nIf you\u2019re infatuated by its privacy and want to pay for it no matter what, then, by all means, go for this provider. If you\u2019re more rational, you\u2019ll realize that NordVPN is better and usually costs less. Proton VPN, on the other hand, will beat most of its rivals on sheer privacy/security alone, which is what many users will appreciate the most."

      "text": "Paperwork, check. Passport, check. Portable charger, check. VPN? The thrill of a new journey awaits, and you\u2019ve meticulously planned your itinerary and double-checked everything. Or almost everything. What about your online privacy and security while you\u2019re on the go? That\u2019s where using a VPN for travel comes in.\nConnecting to public Wi-Fi networks at airports, cafes, and hotels can put your personal information at risk. Cybercriminals target these networks and unsuspecting people, and stealing your data can be surprisingly easy. Plus, a good travel VPN will help you stay connected to your home by bypassing network restrictions. That capability is especially useful in countries with strict internet censorship.\nThat said, VPNs are not all on the same level. This article will explore the best VPNs to trust on your next trip abroad to make your experience safer and more enjoyable.\nThe Best VPN for Travel \u2014 Our 5 Favorite Options of 2025\nThe VPN market is saturated with providers. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t all offer the same degree of quality and reliability. Randomly selecting the VPN to use on your next journey may result in a choice that falls short in several areas.\nSo, to help you navigate through the clutter, we\u2019ve thoroughly tested and reviewed dozens of services to identify the best VPNs for travel. Let\u2019s get down to it.\n7492 servers\n118 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n10 simultaneous connections\n9.4 /10\n3000 servers\n105 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n8 simultaneous connections\n9.1 /10\n27000 servers\n91 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\nUnlimited connections\n9 /10\n6500 servers\n112 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n10 simultaneous connections\n8.8 /10\n3000 servers\n100 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\nUnlimited connections\n8.7 /10\n1. NordVPN\nNordVPN tops the list of the best VPNs for travel, and for good reason. NordVPN offers a comprehensive suite of features, including military-grade encryption, to secure your online traffic during your trips from prying eyes.\nThe service has a wide-spectrum toolkit with advanced features like Onion over VPN and Double VPN, as well as extras like an ad-blocker and dedicated IP addresses (although it\u2019s a paid option). It comes with a system-wide and app-specific kill switch and prevents the exposure of your DNS queries.\nIt\u2019s based in Panama, a privacy-friendly jurisdiction. On top of that, NordVPN has a verified no-logs policy and uses RAM-only servers. There\u2019s no chance the details of your online sessions will be exposed to governments or malicious entities.\nThe VPN\u2019s widespread network comprising over 7,100 servers in 118 countries is another reason why it\u2019s our top VPN for traveling in 2025. It includes all the popular countries and some pretty obscure locations. That means you\u2019ll almost always have connection options nearby on your adventures.\nThey\u2019re high-speed 10 Gbps servers, so you needn\u2019t worry about buffering or lags while browsing or streaming, especially while using its custom NordLynx protocol. We were able to confirm this during the tests conducted with NordVPN.\nSuperior capabilities add to its effectiveness as a travel VPN. From your hotel room, you can access region-blocked content wherever it has a server location. That includes streaming services like Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Hulu, HBO Max, and more. An added bonus, you can rely on NordVPN if you are traveling to a country with heavy internet censorship (it\u2019s notably one of the most reliable VPNs in China).\nNordVPN is compatible with the major operating systems and devices and allows up to 10 simultaneous device connections per account. A 30-day money-back guarantee backs your subscription, ensuring it\u2019s risk-free.\nPros\n- Expansive global network of servers\n- Blazing-fast connection speeds\n- Unblocks geo-restrictions\n- Multiple security audits\n- Several advanced and extra features\n- Privacy-friendly jurisdiction\nCons\n- No customer support available by phone\n- No GUI for Linux\n2. ExpressVPN\nExpressVPN is one of the best VPNs for both domestic and international travel. This service is fully loaded with security and privacy features, ensuring that you\u2019re not exposing anything to the watchful eyes of foreign governments and cybercriminals.\nBank-level AES 256-bit encryption scrambles your online traffic, so it stays for your eyes only. Network Lock (its iteration of a kill switch) and IP/DNS leak protection plug any loopholes that could expose your data. Obfuscation disguises your VPN use in restrictive countries that frown on the technology. In addition, we found that its Threat Manager is pretty effective at blocking malicious data sharing.\nIf you\u2019re a privacy-conscious traveler, you don\u2019t want your online activities potentially leading back to you. ExpressVPN\u2019s no-logs policy and TrustedServer technology ensure that will never happen. They\u2019re both verified by third parties, so you can be sure. If you\u2019re curious, more details about this can be found in our ExpressVPN review.\n3,000+ servers across 105 countries offer plenty of choice for your international trips. ExpressVPN uses 10 Gbps servers and is easily one of the fastest VPN services around. As a result, you\u2019ll barely notice any difference from your original connection. Couple that with excellent unblocking capabilities, and you have a reliable provider for your streaming needs.\nExpressVPN supports Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and several other platforms. It allows you to connect up to eight devices simultaneously on one account. The only significant downside is the rather expensive pricing, but a 30-day money-back guarantee lets you opt out if you\u2019re not convinced it\u2019s worth it.\nPros\n- Servers located in 105 countries\n- Lightning-fast connection speeds\n- Unblock most streaming libraries\n- Excellent customer support\n- Multiple security audits\nCons\n- Pricey VPN plans\n- Less advanced features than NordVPN\n3. Private Internet Access\nPIA\u2019s headquarters is in the United States. While that\u2019s a Five Eyes member country, the provider uses RAM-based servers and has proven its no-logs stance in court. Twice.\nPlus, all its apps are open-source, just in case you want to check the code under the hood yourself.\nWe find the VPN\u2019s array of security and privacy tools pretty impressive, making it a great option for staying safe online while traveling. It implements AES 256-bit encryption, but you can also choose the more performance-friendly AES 128-bit algorithm. Its MACE feature blocks ads, trackers, and malware, and the VPN prevents DNS queries from leaking.\nDon\u2019t let PIA\u2019s massive US presence trick you into thinking it\u2019s strictly an American VPN. While it has servers in every state, the VPN also has upwards of 30,000 servers across 91 countries globally.\nNo competitor comes close to that offering. And while sheer size doesn\u2019t tell the entire story regarding performance, combined with its 10 Gbps connections, you won\u2019t have to endure sluggish speeds. We experienced the best results using WireGuard.\nPrivate Internet Access unblocks Netflix US and a few other libraries. It also works with services like Amazon Prime Video and Hulu. That said, you may find its unblocking abilities somewhat inconsistent.\nStill, it\u2019s the best VPN for traveling with several family members or a big group \u2014 one subscription covers all the devices you want it to, no problem. Plus, its device compatibility is on par with other top-rated VPN services.\nRisk-free, you can check out what Private Internet Access has to offer for 30 days after buying a plan.\nPros\n- Unlimited simultaneous device connections\n- Vast network of servers\n- Affordable pricing\n- Audited no-logs policy\n- Open-source apps\nCons\n- Inconsistent unblocking capabilities\n- Five Eyes jurisdiction\n4. Proton VPN\nProton VPN\u2019s user-friendly apps are easy to install and use, making it the best travel VPN for beginners. They are also packed with high-level functionality to keep your data safe and private during your trips abroad.\nFor instance, Secure Core servers are particularly useful if you\u2019re constantly on the go. It ensures that hopping on public networks doesn\u2019t come back to haunt you because you\u2019ll get a double encryption layer that prevents tracking and data stealing.\nIn addition, Proton VPN covers the fundamentals. It comes with industry-standard encryption and a kill switch that leaves no loopholes when the VPN connection drops. Moreover, it directs all your DNS requests through a secure tunnel to prevent leaks.\nOn top of that, Proton VPN is transparent. Its no-logs policy has undergone multiple audits, and the provider goes the extra mile with its perfect forward secrecy and RAM-only server technology. Not to mention open-source apps that every expert can freely examine.\nProton VPN is the closest to Private Internet Access in terms of sheer size. Its impressive network contains more than 9,900 servers across 117 countries. Speeds are not quite on the same level as NordVPN or ExpressVPN, but they are pretty fast, regardless.\nDedicated streaming, torrenting, and Tor over VPN servers come in handy if you frequently engage in those activities. You\u2019ll find the streaming-optimized options especially convenient on trips abroad. Proton VPN is a very efficient VPN for Dubai and the UAE in general. During our tests, it easily unblocked several local and international platforms.\nProton VPN\u2019s ten-device simultaneous connection limit is respectable too. However, if you purchase a long-term account, you can also enjoy a hefty 60%+ discount and pay roughly three quids a month. At this price, you\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a beefier VPN.\nExcept for NordVPN and PIA, that is.\nPros\n- Massive network of servers globally\n- Multiple security audits\n- Dedicated servers for streaming, P2P, and Onion over VPN\n- User-friendly service\nCons\n- It won\u2019t work in China\n- Speeds could be a tad better\n5. Surfshark\nSurfshark hasn\u2019t been around for as long as the other services on this list. However, its spot among the top VPNs for travel is well-earned. In fact, it\u2019s easily one of the best providers on the market.\nAdvanced tools like obfuscation, NoBorders, and Multi-Hop make Surfshark an excellent option for highly restrictive countries like China. That aside, it employs strong encryption, a kill switch, and DNS leak protection.\nSurfshark boasts a no-log policy, a claim that independent auditors have tested and found factual. You can be sure you won\u2019t leave digital breadcrumbs that could lead right back to you while connected to its servers.\nThe VPN\u2019s network, comprising more than 3,200 servers, spans 100 countries on six continents. That\u2019s plenty enough to ensure you have options nearby wherever you travel. Its connection speeds have significantly increased recently, and you can now enjoy bufferless and lag-free experiences while online.\nWe can say the same for the provider\u2019s ability to bypass geo-restrictions. In our tests, Surfshark performed excellently, unblocking platforms like Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video hassle-free.\nSurfshark VPN is a favorite among cost-conscious travelers for its affordable long-term pricing. And, like Private Internet Access, there\u2019s no need for an extra subscription if you have many devices or are traveling in a group.\nAll Surfshark plans come with a 30-day money-back guarantee, which leaves you with enough time to decide whether to commit.\nPros\n- Unlimited simultaneous device connections\n- Feature-rich VPN\n- Affordable long-term pricing\n- Fast connection speeds\nCons\n- Expensive monthly pricing\n- Inconsistent torrenting performance\n- No antivirus in the Starter plan\nHow to Use a VPN While Traveling\nIt\u2019s a pretty straightforward process. Here\u2019s what to do in 5 steps to safeguard your online presence while you\u2019re traveling.\n- Choose the most reliable service: Select a reputable premium VPN service that caters to your travel needs. You want to consider factors like server network size, speed, security and privacy features, and streaming capabilities. We recommend NordVPN, as it checks all the right boxes.\n- Subscribe: Visit the VPN\u2019s official website and choose a subscription plan that works for you. Provide the required information, and complete the transaction using one of the payment methods available.\n- Download the VPN App: Most premium VPNs have clients (and manual configurations) for Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, routers, and several other devices. Head to the download page to download the appropriate app for your gadget.\n- Configure: Launch the VPN app and sign in with your account credentials. Configure the app to fit your travel needs. For instance, you may choose a protocol like NordLynx or WireGuard for better speeds and security. Make sure to enable the kill switch.\n- Connect to a VPN Server: Navigate to the server selection menu and choose a server in a different location. Click the \u201cConnect\u201d button and wait for the VPN to establish a secure connection.\nCongratulations \u2014 you\u2019re all set to use the internet securely and without restrictions while traveling. If you\u2019re in a country with heavy-handed restrictions, confirm that the VPN has changed your IP address using a tool like whatismyipaddress.com.\nWhy You Need a VPN for Your Next Domestic or International Trip\nYou\u2019re sipping a latte in a Parisian caf\u00e9 or lounging in a pool in a Bali resort, casually surfing the internet.\nThe issue?\nYou\u2019re connected to an unsecured public Wi-Fi network \u2014 a potential hotbed for hackers looking to intercept your data. Without a VPN, your sensitive information is fair game.\nThere may be other issues to worry about, especially if you\u2019re traveling to a country with strict internet censorship measures. These nations (like China, Russia, or Iran) block access to many popular websites you\u2019re used to back home. Thankfully, a VPN comes through, allowing you to bypass these restrictions by connecting to a server in a different country.\nPlus, it can maintain your online privacy by masking your IP address so your ISP can\u2019t track your online activities. This will come in handy in regions with invasive surveillance practices. Think you\u2019re unlikely to visit one of those? Think again. Many liberal countries are in alliances like the 5/9/14 Eyes and have privacy-unfriendly data retention laws.\nMoreover, a VPN can help you catch up on local content back home by spoofing your location to trick the platforms and websites you frequently use. For instance, a quality streaming VPN provider will unblock American Netflix even if you\u2019re away from the US. You can also use your bank account without triggering fraud detectors.\nHow to Choose a VPN for Travel\nWe didn\u2019t exactly use this article as an excuse to country-hop the world (wouldn\u2019t that be a great perk?). Still, our global team of experts has meticulously evaluated 40+ services to identify the best VPNs for travelers in 2025.\nHere are the top factors we took into account while making this list:\n- Security and Privacy: We prioritized VPNs with robust security and privacy features. That includes virtually uncrackable encryption (like AES-256), a strict no-logs policy, and other functionality like a kill switch and DNS leak protection. Our picks are loaded with even more advanced and extra features.\n- Server Locations: The more server locations a VPN has, the better, so we looked for providers with a vast global network. That way, you can easily find a fast and reliable connection wherever your travels take you.\n- Bypassing Geo-Restrictions: Also, we selected VPNs that can bypass geo-restrictions and region blocks on streaming services and websites. As a result, you can access your favorite content from anywhere in the world,\n- Connection Speed: Traveling usually means relying on different Wi-Fi networks, and some will be slower than others. We tested VPNs to ensure they offer fast and consistent connection speeds, minimizing buffering and lagging for your online activities.\n- Ease of Use: A VPN should be easy to set up and use, even for those who aren\u2019t tech-savvy. We favored VPNs with intuitive interfaces and user-friendly apps across various devices and operating systems.\n- Customer Support: What\u2019s more, we only considered providers with responsive and knowledgeable customer support through multiple channels. Each travel VPN on our list is available 24/7.\n- Compatibility: Whether you\u2019re traveling with a smartphone, tablet, or laptop, each VPN presented has you covered. You can even download or manually configure your hotel room\u2019s smart TV.\n- Money-Back Guarantee: For peace of mind, we recommended VPNs offering a money-back guarantee. Consequently, you can try any service risk-free and get a refund if you\u2019re not satisfied with the experience.\nCan You Use a Free VPN When Traveling?\nIf you\u2019re trying to save money while traveling, hopping on a free VPN instead of a paid version can seem like a good idea. While we see the appeal, we don\u2019t recommend doing so unless you have to. Here\u2019s why: they come with significant drawbacks.\nProviders offering freemium VPNs usually severely limit their free versions to nudge you into an upgrade. That means a small network of servers to choose from, which also translates into congestion in peak hours and slow connection speeds. Plus, you may have to deal with data caps and bandwidth throttling, both of which are frustrating.\nMoreover, many free VPNs employ weak encryption and lack the advanced features you may need on your travels. They may also extensively log your data to make a profit, which defeats the primary purpose of using a VPN in the first place.\nOverall, relying on a free VPN while traveling is likely to expose you to more risks than benefits. You\u2019re better off using a cheap VPN service if pricing is an issue.\nFinal Words\nYou don\u2019t want to expose your sensitive information to hackers lurking on unsecured networks, ISPs, and privacy-unfriendly governments on your trips.\nA VPN helps safeguard your privacy when you travel abroad \u2014 and breaks restrictions to geo-blocked content in other locations.\nThis article explored several options and what they offer to help you choose the best VPN for travel. Our top choice is NordVPN, thanks to its impressive global server network, blazing-fast connection speeds, and powerful collection of security and privacy options. Interested in giving it a go? A 30-day money-back guarantee offers a way out if you\u2019re not 100% satisfied.\nFAQs\nHere are some frequently asked questions about using a VPN while traveling around the world.\nWhich VPN is best for travel?\nNordVPN is the best VPN for travel overall, with its 7,100+ servers in 118 countries worldwide. It offers speedy connections and ensures your traffic is shielded from restrictive governments and hackers. Plus, the service has exceptional geo-block bypassing capabilities for added convenience.\nShould you use a VPN when traveling?\nYes, you should. A VPN safeguards your personal information while on the go, ensuring your online presence and data stay safe and private in other countries. What\u2019s more, it helps you to access websites and online services locked to your home country or other foreign regions.\nA VPN is our standard companion for fun and/or business trips. Inquire yourself with more VPN benefits outlined in this article \u2013 you\u2019ll be amazed at what this \u201clittle\u201d service can do.\nHow to get a VPN for international travel?\n- Subscribe to a reliable travel VPN like NordVPN.\n- Download the VPN app to your device.\n- Launch the app and select a server in a different location.\n- Enjoy a private online experience free from restrictions."

      "text": "So, you\u2019ve tried to watch your favorite shows on streaming platforms, only to hit a wall with the message \u2018This content isn\u2019t available in your region.\u2019 Welcome to the world of geoblocking, where streaming services restrict access based on your location, all thanks to complicated licensing agreements.\nLuckily, there\u2019s a way around it. One of the fastest and simplest tools to unlock geo-restricted content is Smart DNS. This clever service reroutes your internet traffic to make it appear as though you\u2019re browsing from another country, allowing you to access that locked content without any hiccups. Unlike a VPN (Virtual Private Network), Smart DNS doesn\u2019t encrypt your data, so it\u2019s faster but not as private.\nIn the following lines, we\u2019ll explain exactly how Smart DNS works, how it compares to VPNs and proxies, and, most importantly, how you can start using it today to bypass restrictions and stream the content you love.\nWhat is Smart DNS: Definiton\nAt its core, Smart DNS is a service designed to help you bypass geo-restrictions by altering the way your device interacts with the internet. Think of it like tricking the internet into believing you\u2019re browsing from a different country, even though you\u2019re still sitting on your couch. It\u2019s particularly useful for streaming, where services like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+ block content based on your location.\nBut unlike a VPN, which hides your IP address and encrypts your traffic for privacy, Smart DNS focuses purely on speed and accessibility. It reroutes only your DNS (Domain Name System) queries, which are like the \u201cphonebook lookups\u201d of the internet that connect domain names (like netflix.com) to their respective IP addresses. By doing this, Smart DNS lets you slip past regional blocks without affecting your internet speed.\nSo, why not just use a VPN, you ask? Well, while VPNs offer stronger privacy through encryption, they can sometimes slow down your connection due to the added security layers. Smart DNS, on the other hand, prioritizes speed and works on devices that don\u2019t natively support VPN apps, such as certain Smart TVs, gaming consoles, and streaming devices.\nHow Does Smart DNS Work?\nWhenever you try to visit a website, your device makes a DNS request, which is essentially asking for the IP address associated with the domain name. Normally, these DNS requests are handled by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). But with Smart DNS, those requests get rerouted through a proxy server in a different location.\nHere\u2019s what happens in the background:\nDNS Rerouting\nWhen you access a website or streaming platform that\u2019s geo-restricted, Smart DNS intercepts your DNS request and replaces your original location with the IP of a region where the content is allowed.\nNo Encryption\nUnlike a VPN, which encrypts all your internet traffic, Smart DNS leaves your data untouched. This lack of encryption is what makes Smart DNS much faster, as there\u2019s no additional overhead slowing down your connection.\nUnblock Content\nOnce the rerouted DNS request is processed, you\u2019ll be able to access geo-blocked content as if you were in the allowed region, whether that\u2019s US Netflix, BBC iPlayer, or any other restricted site.\nBecause Smart DNS focuses solely on rerouting location data, it\u2019s the perfect choice for streaming lovers who want fast, seamless access to international content without worrying about privacy. However, while it\u2019s ideal for streaming, it doesn\u2019t provide the same level of security or anonymity that a VPN does.\nBenefits of Using Smart DNS\nUsing Smart DNS for streaming content offers several advantages, especially if you\u2019re focused on accessing geo-restricted platforms like Netflix (see our article on how to unblock Netflix), Hulu, or BBC iPlayer without sacrificing speed.\nHere are the key benefits:\n- Faster Streaming: Since Smart DNS doesn\u2019t encrypt your traffic, it offers faster connection speeds compared to VPNs. This means less buffering and smoother streaming, even for high-definition content.\n- Wide Device Compatibility: Smart DNS works on many devices that don\u2019t support VPNs, such as Smart TVs, game consoles, and streaming devices like Apple TV, making it a versatile solution for accessing geo-restricted content.\n- Easy Setup: It\u2019s simple to configure Smart DNS, and once it\u2019s set up, there\u2019s no need to toggle it on or off. This ease of use makes it beginner-friendly and hassle-free for continuous streaming.\nLimitations of Smart DNS\nWhile Smart DNS has some clear advantages for streaming, it does come with limitations that may make it unsuitable for certain use cases. Understanding these limitations can help you decide when to use Smart DNS and when another solution, like a VPN, might be better.\n- No Encryption: Smart DNS doesn\u2019t secure your traffic, meaning your online activities are visible to your ISP and other third parties. If privacy is a concern, a VPN is the better option.\n- Limited Access to Some Content: While it works with many streaming services, platforms like Netflix and Hulu continually update their geo-blocking techniques, which may block Smart DNS services over time. At this point, VPNs remain the best option. This is especially true if you\u2019re looking to change regions on the Prime Video platform.\n- No IP Masking: Unlike a VPN, Smart DNS doesn\u2019t hide your actual IP address, which may leave your browsing activity visible and limit access to some region-restricted websites.\n- Not Suitable for Privacy-Sensitive Tasks: If you\u2019re dealing with sensitive information or need protection for tasks like online banking or secure browsing, Smart DNS won\u2019t provide the required encryption or privacy.\nBest VPNs with Smart DNS Feature\nFor users who want the speed of Smart DNS but also the flexibility and security of a VPN, some top VPN providers offer Smart DNS as part of their service.\nThis gives you the best of both worlds, with seamless streaming for geo-restricted content and the option to switch to a fully encrypted VPN connection when privacy matters.\n7492 servers\n118 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n10 simultaneous connections\n9.4 /10\n3000 servers\n105 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\n8 simultaneous connections\n9.1 /10\n27000 servers\n91 covered countries\n30 days money-back guarantee\nUnlimited connections\n9 /10\n1. NordVPN\nNordVPN\u2019s built-in feature makes it the best SmartDNS VPN. It offers a SmartDNS feature that\u2019s easy to use and affordable compared to others.\nDuring our tests and analysis of NordVPN, we found that its SmartDNS delivers fast and stable connections for US-based streaming, though it lacks support for UK services like BBC iPlayer. However, with NordVPN\u2019s SmartPlay feature, it seamlessly combines SmartDNS and VPN technology for enhanced streaming.\nSmartPlay automatically activates when you access geo-blocked content, offering a blend of speed and encryption when needed, making NordVPN excellent for streaming. Backed by over 6,800 servers in 111 countries, NordVPN offers exceptional performance for unblocking content globally, even though the SmartDNS feature is limited to US servers.\nPriced at around $3 per month on a long-term plan, NordVPN offers a budget-friendly solution without sacrificing performance. It also includes a 30-day money-back guarantee, giving you plenty of time to try the service risk-free.\nAlthough SmartDNS is great for streaming, NordVPN shines with its additional security features, such as Threat Protection to block malware and ads, AES-256 encryption, and an advanced kill switch for protecting your identity online.\nPros\n- Affordable pricing\n- Fast US streaming\n- Easy SmartDNS setup\n- Excellent server network (6,800+)\n- Strong security features\n- Supports 10 devices\nCons\n- Limited to US servers for SmartDNS\n2. ExpressVPN\nExpressVPN is widely regarded as one of the best VPNs. It natively supports Smart DNS, and its MediaStreamer feature, ExpressVPN\u2019s version of Smart DNS, is an excellent solution for unblocking geo-restricted content.\nMediaStreamer makes it simple to access US-based platforms like Netflix, Hulu, and HBO Max by rerouting your DNS requests through a US server, making it look like you\u2019re browsing from the United States. It\u2019s especially useful for devices that don\u2019t support VPN apps, such as Apple TVs or game consoles.\nIn our ExpressVPN review, its MediaStreamer feature provided consistent and fast streaming speeds, allowing us to watch content in HD without buffering.While MediaStreamer focuses primarily on unblocking US content, you can switch to ExpressVPN\u2019s full service and connect to any of its 3,000+ servers in 105 countries to unblock content from other regions.\nOne of ExpressVPN\u2019s major advantages is its proprietary Lightway protocol, which significantly boosts performance, delivering speeds of over 10 Gbps in many cases.\nAt around $5 per month on a long-term plan, ExpressVPN is on the pricier side, but it justifies the cost with excellent performance, privacy features, and security. It comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee, giving you the freedom to test it risk-free.\nPros\n- Extremely fast streaming speeds\n- Great streaming capabilities\n- Easy setup with MediaStreamer\n- Large server network (105 countries)\n- Lightway for enhanced performance\nCons\n- Higher pricing compared to others\n- No advanced customization features\n3. Private Internet Access\nPrivate Internet Access (also called PIA VPN) offers a Smart DNS feature designed for seamless streaming on devices that don\u2019t natively support VPNs.\nIn our tests, PIA\u2019s Smart DNS delivered a solid performance, maintaining fast speeds across various US platforms. We also noticed that Private Internet Access supports Smart DNS for Germany, the UK, the USA, Japan, and the Netherlands. PIA\u2019s 29,000+ servers in 91 countries ensure that when you switch to the full VPN, you can unblock global content easily.\nPIA also excels when it comes to privacy. While SmartDNS doesn\u2019t include encryption, PIA\u2019s regular VPN service offers AES-256 encryption, a kill switch, and a strict no-logs policy. It is a great choice for users who want privacy alongside streaming capabilities. Additionally, PIA\u2019s MACE feature helps block ads and malware, ensuring a smoother browsing and streaming experience.\nAt around $2 per month, PIA is one of the cheapest Smart DNS VPN options available. Plus, you get a 30-day money-back guarantee, so your investment is always protected.\nPros\n- Extremely affordable pricing\n- Large server network (84 countries)\n- Strong privacy features with the VPN\n- SmartDNS support for 5 countries\nCons\n- Primarily focused on US content for Smart DNS\n- Streaming is solid, but not as good as NordVPN\nHow to Enable and Use Smart DNS\nEnabling Smart DNS is straightforward, and in this guide, we\u2019ll use NordVPN as an example to walk you through the setup. Follow these simple steps to get it working.\nStep 1: Log in to Your NordVPN Account\nStart by visiting the NordVPN website and logging into your account. If you don\u2019t have an account yet, you\u2019ll need to create one and choose a plan. Once logged in, head over to your Nord Account dashboard.\nStep 2: Activate SmartDNS\nOnce you\u2019re in your Nord Account, look for the SmartDNS section under \u201cServices.\u201d Click on Activate SmartDNS. The system will automatically detect and register your IP address. If this doesn\u2019t happen automatically, you may need to manually whitelist your IP by clicking on \u201cRegister my IP.\u201d\nStep 3: Get Your DNS Addresses\nOnce SmartDNS is activated, NordVPN will provide you with two DNS server addresses. These are the addresses you\u2019ll need to input into your device\u2019s DNS settings to bypass geo-restrictions.\nStep 4: Configure Your Device\nNow that you have the DNS addresses, you\u2019ll need to manually configure your device. Here\u2019s a general overview of how to input the DNS addresses on common devices:\n- Smart TV: Navigate to Settings > Network > Advanced Settings > DNS Settings, and input the DNS addresses provided by NordVPN.\n- Gaming Console (PlayStation/Xbox): Go to Network Settings, select Set up Internet Connection, choose Custom, and then enter the DNS addresses under DNS Settings.\n- Apple TV: Go to Settings > Network > Wi-Fi/Ethernet > Configure DNS, switch to Manual, and enter the provided DNS addresses. That being said, know that NordVPN offers an excellent VPN app for Apple TV.\nAfter you\u2019ve entered the DNS addresses, restart your device to apply the changes. Once it\u2019s back on, your SmartDNS should be active, and you\u2019ll be able to access geo-restricted content like U.S. Netflix, Hulu, or other streaming services.\nConclusion\nSmart DNS offers a fast, simple way to bypass geo-restrictions, making it perfect for streaming content without the speed issues sometimes associated with VPNs. For users focused on streaming, NordVPN stands out as the best Smart DNS VPN with its SmartPlay feature, offering seamless access to geo-blocked content while maintaining speed and reliability.\nExpressVPN, with its MediaStreamer feature, is a great choice for those looking to unblock content globally. It offers excellent streaming speeds and versatility. PIA is a more affordable option, providing solid performance, especially for US-based content.\nFAQs\nTo wrap things up, here are some frequently asked questions that can help clarify any remaining doubts you might have about Smart DNS and how it works with VPN services.\nHow is Smart DNS different from a VPN?\nA VPN encrypts your internet traffic and hides your IP address, providing privacy and security, but this can sometimes slow down your connection. Smart DNS, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t encrypt your data, allowing for faster streaming speeds but without the same level of privacy.\nCan Smart DNS unblock Netflix and other streaming services?\nYes, Smart DNS can unblock streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and BBC iPlayer, but the success of this depends on the service\u2019s ability to detect Smart DNS usage. NordVPN\u2019s SmartPlay and ExpressVPN\u2019s MediaStreamer are particularly reliable for unblocking a wide range of content.\nIs Smart DNS secure for online activities?\nNo, Smart DNS doesn\u2019t encrypt your traffic, meaning your activities remain visible to your ISP and others. It\u2019s excellent for streaming but not ideal for privacy-focused tasks like online banking. For privacy and security, you should use a VPN instead."

      "text": "Imagine the shock on your face when you discover that the movie you wanted to see so badly is geo-restricted. This shock is what makes people use a VPN for Amazon Prime Video. This service, while available worldwide, isn\u2019t the same for everyone. Its libraries are vastly different sometimes, but most of the time, the best library is the one in the USA.\nIs there a way to watch Amazon Prime Video abroad? Sure. You can do it in most countries. However, if you want the creme de la creme titles, you\u2019ll need to access the US library. Being overseas makes it impossible unless you resort to, as we say, trickery.\nA VPN will set your IP to the USA and trick the site into \u201cthinking\u201d you\u2019re there. But Prime Video \u201cprimed\u201d itself with defenses against VPNs, so most are detected. Okay, so you\u2019re in a sea of problems right now. You want the most reliable Prime Video VPN.\nSimultaneously, you want to watch Amazon Prime Video abroad and access the US library with the most content. Luckily, these two go hand in hand. Today\u2019s guide will list the most suitable providers for this platform based on our test, and explain how to change your Amazon Prime Video location.\nChange Your Prime Video Country With These VPNs: Quick Summary\nLooking to modify your Prime Video location but can\u2019t find a VPN that works? Check out our top 5 picks, all tested by our experts:\n- NordVPN \u2013 the best overall Prime Video VPN\n- ExpressVPN \u2013 the fastest premium VPN for Amazon Prime Video\n- Private Internet Access \u2013 servers in all American states\n- Proton VPN \u2013 streaming-optimized servers in 100+ countries\n- Surfshark \u2013 unblocks Prime Video abroad on all devices\nIf you\u2019re not sure how to change your location on this streaming service, follow these short steps:\n- Get a VPN from our list.\n- Install the VPN on your device.\n- Connect to a server in a country whose library you want to access.\n- Visit Amazon Prime Video, sign in, and enjoy.\nWhy Do You Need a VPN for Amazon Prime Video?\nOkay, so what\u2019s the deal with this streaming service? As said, it will work worldwide but regional differences spawn library differences. People in Germany or the Netherlands don\u2019t have the same content as Americans, Japanese, Canadians, and so forth.\nPractice shows that the latter three have far better and more ubiquitous content. You\u2019ve likely come across a title that you can\u2019t watch, with a message saying \u201cThis video is currently unavailable to watch in your location.\u201d\nWell, there\u2019s a slap from the geo-restriction.\nThe key is to use a VPN for Amazon Prime Video, which, as touched upon, changes your online location. By connecting to a server somewhere else, you\u2019re automatically assigned an IP address from that server. As a result, your online presence originates from that IP address.\nWatch Prime Video Abroad With NordVPN\nIf the title you want to watch is in the USA, technically, such an IP address would let you access this title. However, VPNs recommended for Prime Video by so-called \u201cexperts\u201d often fail. The platform blocks VPN-originating IP addresses, resulting in catastrophic fails.\nThis is why the best VPN for Amazon Prime Video must be streaming-optimized and reliable. After all, the only reason to use it on this platform is to access its region-locked content. Whether you want to watch Prime Video outside the USA or unblock content from other countries (catalogs), you can\u2019t do it without changing your IP address.\nHow to Bypass Geo-Blocks on Prime Video With a VPN?\nThis brings us to another section \u2013 the actual unblocking guide. We gave you a shortlist of the best picks for this scenario and NordVPN stuck out as a champ. We deem this provider the most befitting for its fast speeds, over 6,400 servers, and unrestricted bandwidth.\nHaving tested it at least 100 times, we know how well it works for streaming. It can unblock Netflix, BBC iPlayer, Hulu, and this platform in an instant. Best of all, it works on all devices, making it suitable for people on Fire TV, Android, iOS, macOS, and other systems.\nIn this guide, we\u2019ll explain how to use NordVPN to change your Prime Video country. However, the procedure is identical even if you use other recommended VPNs below.\nStep 1 \u2013 The VPN Setup\nLet\u2019s start with the most vital step. NordVPN fits the bill perfectly, so go subscribe to it. If you\u2019re unsure how, you can tap the button below to go to its website. From here, pick the deal you want but keep in mind its 2-year plans are on sale, with hefty discounts on each.\nWhen the plan is selected, pay for it and provide your email address. After that, you\u2019ll get a confirmation email, which, when opened, will let you create a password to complete the initial subscription process. Now, it\u2019s time to download the service to your device.\nNordVPN has a great free VPN application for Mac, Windows, and other platforms, so be free to choose. With the app installed, open it and sign in with your email and password.\nThe most important part is connecting to a server and changing your Prime Video country to watch the catalog you want abroad. For this scenario, we\u2019ll use the US server but you can go for any you deem suitable. Open the server list, find this country, and click on it:\nOnce you see \u201cConnected\u201d in green, you\u2019re set.\nStep 2 \u2013 Watching Prime Video Abroad\nThe last step is perhaps the sweetest! Now that you\u2019re equipped with the #1-rated VPN for Amazon Prime Video, you\u2019re good to go. Visit the website, sign in or sign up, and start streaming the content you couldn\u2019t before.\nBest VPNs That Work With Prime Video in 2025\nWe\u2019ll assume you can ready half-decently, so you\u2019ve already discovered our recommended VPNs for Prime Video in 2025. We haven\u2019t yet explained why they made it to our list and what makes them so good. Let\u2019s do that now.\n1. NordVPN\nPros\n- Both apps and VPN extensions unblock Prime Video\n- NordLynx protocol\n- 256-bit AES encryption standard\n- Servers based on RAM\n- Smart DNS works on all devices\n- Affordable plans\nCons\n- Double VPN servers can be slower\n- Its browser extension requires a subscription\nNordVPN is our go-to choice because of its overall reliability. We explained how to use it to watch Amazon Prime Video outside the USA and modify your location. However, the provider has another ace \u2013 a nifty little browser extension with location spoofing!\nThis browser extension is vital for unblocking restricted streaming sites. For example, this was one of the rare providers that worked with ESPN+ in our tests. Its location spoofing also lets you access Max anywhere using Chrome, Brave, Firefox, Edge, or Safari \u2013 quite handy.\nApart from that, NordVPN is one of the fastest premium VPNs for Prime Video. Its 10 Gbps server servers perfectly complement NordLynx, NordVPN\u2019s revolutionary protocol. Users also enjoy its limitless bandwidth, which allows for streaming and uninterrupted P2P.\nThe provider\u2019s device compatibility is top-tier. It supports all devices and offers 10 simultaneous connections in all plans. Another perk is Smart DNS, which comes in handy for streaming on non-VPN-friendly devices. We\u2019ll mention its security, which is above average.\nNordVPN\u2019s AES encryption exemplifies what a nearly ideal provider should look like. Coupled with a no-logging policy plus RAM-only servers, you get an ultimate privacy tool. Its price is very low as well, as long as you aim for its 2-year plans. You\u2019ll pay under $3.6 a month.\nIts monthly plans are a tad pricey but nothing to be up in hands about. Rest assured, the provider\u2019s 30-day money-back guarantee is always there to back you up. However, the chances of being disappointed are slim to none.\n2. ExpressVPN\nPros\n- Powerful 10 Gbps servers\n- Advanced Protection blocks ads\n- Works with Amazon Prime US\n- Support for Firestick TV\n- Very easy to set up and use\nCons\n- Needs a few more advanced security features\n- It could be slightly more affordable\nExpressVPN lets you promptly access any blocked website, be it Amazon Prime Video or Netflix. As a reputable Prime Video VPN, ExpressVPN has over 3,000 servers globally, all optimized for streaming. After testing it, both its apps and browser extensions were phenomenal.\nThe latter was especially endearing, with WebRTC leak protection that further hides your original location. As a result, you can change your Prime Video country and access numerous libraries. ExpressVPN was recently reviewed by our experts, with a nearly perfect score.\nLike NordVPN, its speeds are phenomenal and the average reduction is roughly 18-20 percent. ExpressVPN uses Lightway, a protocol developed by this company. It combines speed and security, giving you no chance of finding its shortcomings (there are none).\nThe provider includes a few extras, such as split tunneling and Advanced Protection. Obsessed with ad-blocking will adore the latter because it blocks pop-ups and ads. On the other hand, some will appreciate its MediaStreamer, a fancy-name Smart DNS tool.\nExpressVPN works on any device, including your Firestick. This means you can watch Prime Video outside the USA on a large screen with the VPN anywhere. Plug it into a hotel\u2019s TV, install ExpressVPN, and you\u2019re all set. ExpressVPN has 8 simultaneous connections too!\nThat\u2019s 2 less than NordVPN but really, you won\u2019t be that nit-picky, will you? If you don\u2019t mind paying a premium price, ExpressVPN will be your best friend \u2013 after your dog.

Private Internet Access\nPros\n- No limits on concurrent connections\n- Servers in all American states\n- Automatic kill switch\n- Built-in Multi-hop\n- Excellent performance with WireGuard\nCons\n- No Firestick TV support\n- It lacks a free plan\n- Slightly janky Windows client\nPrivate Internet Access has all you need to change your country on Amazon Prime Video. As one of the top-rated options, it packs a whopping 30,000 servers, unlimited bandwidth, and unlimited simultaneous connections. Best of all? It costs a pocket change a month.\nThis provider offers WireGuard, which powers almost all connections and delivers jaw-dropping performance. PIA\u2019s apps contain MACE, a reliable ad blocker that will keep pop-ups and trackers away. No wonder we listed it as one of the top VPNs for ad-blocking.\nPrivate Internet Access has a handful of US-based servers deemed \u201cfor streaming\u201d, which you can use to watch Prime Video abroad. In addition, it covers the entire US, which means servers in all 51 states. The provider also has Smart DNS, which makes streaming easier.\nWe love its apps across all devices, and while the Windows app is a tad slower, others are perfect. PIA doesn\u2019t support Firestick TV, which is one of its rare shortcomings. The silver lining is its strong security in the form of AES encryption and an automatic kill switch.\nThis US provider also doesn\u2019t store logs and will keep you anonymous at any moment. PIA\u2019s optional extras make this package quite sweet. You can get an antvirus for $1/mo and there are many dedicated IP addresses for just over $2/mo. What about the overall price?\nAs said, it\u2019s the lowest it\u2019s ever been! PIA costs a tad over $2.1 monthly in its 2-year plan with FOUR free months. We mourn the lack of a free plan but hey, this price is almost as if it was free. Such a great VPN for Prime Video can\u2019t be found at this price \u2013 we promise you.\n4. Proton VPN\nPros\n- Over 6,500 servers worldwide\n- Free plan with uncapped bandwidth\n- Streaming and torrenting prowess\n- Audited no-logging policy\nCons\n- Smart DNS support is lacking\n- Its free plan won\u2019t unblock Prime Video abroad\n- Slower than NordVPN and ExpressVPN\nProton VPN might be a surprising pick for some. Well, not for us, as we\u2019ve been using this provider for years. With over 6,500 servers in 111+ countries, it\u2019s one of the largest providers. Moreover, it sports 2,000+ servers in the US alone, enough for this cause.\nMany US servers are optimized for streaming, allowing them to unblock Prime Video outside the USA. Another addition is WireGuard, which, as explained, does a great job of providing speedy connections. However, keep in mind that Proton VPN is slower than NordVPN.\nThe provider is no slouch when it comes to stability. We noticed its 10 Gbps RAM servers perform exceptionally well and during streaming, there\u2019s no buffering and endless loading screens. Proton\u2019s magnum opus is equipped with the VPN Accelerator \u2013 a great thing.\nYou can use it to speed up your connections for torrenting, gaming, streaming, or any other purpose. Its security is on par, if not better than most VPNs for Prime Video. With Secure Core servers and NetShield, you can ensure total privacy with ad-blocking abilities.\nProton VPN\u2019s generosity doesn\u2019t end there, as it also offers a 100% free VPN for Windows and other platforms. You can download its app for FREE and enjoy uncapped bandwidth, a couple of server locations, and a no-log policy. We\u2019d much rather use its premium plans, as they\u2019re far ahead.\nUnlike in the past, Proton VPN\u2019s price has been cut down to be as attractive as its rivals. In 2025, you\u2019ll find ProtonVPN\u2019s 2-year deal at $3.6 or so a month incredibly enticing. It\u2019s a perfect fusion of rock-solid secure, highly compatible, and very reliable VPN service.\n5. Surfshark\nPros\n- The most efficient pick for streaming\n- Ad-blocking is included\n- NoBorders works against censorship\n- Great-looking apps for all devices\nCons\n- Occasional slowdowns\n- Monthly plans are a bit pricey\n- No antivirus in the entry plan\nThe final pick for today is Surfshark. While it costs almost as much as PIA, Surfshark is slightly less awesome. We think PIA is a bit more secure and offers a larger server fleet. Nonetheless, Surfshark is a phenomenal VPN to use on Prime Video because of its streaming prowess.\nWhile testing it, we detected it could unblock pretty much ANY Amazon Prime catalog. The same goes for Netflix, where Surfshark unblocks over 30 libraries in seconds. This provider amplifies the experience with stellar speeds that rarely drop when using distant servers.\nSurfshark\u2019s apps include an ad blocker, split tunneling, and a kill switch, ensuring you at least get the basic stuff. Advanced stuff includes Multi-hop connections, IP Rotation, and NoBorders, which obfuscates your traffic. We think this is quite handy in China and Iran.\nAs explained in our review of Surfshark, the provider\u2019s plans are different. For example, the mid-tier plan has an antivirus that works surprisingly well and detects the most covert threats. A huge plus is Surfshark\u2019s Search browser which works without tracking.\nThe provider\u2019s collaboration with NordVPN brought about significant improvements. As one of the best VPNs for Prime Video, the provider is now faster than before, it offers a verified no-logging policy, and comes with round-the-clock 24/7 live chat support to aid you.\nThe provider isn\u2019t expensive either and offers a 30-day money-back guarantee. On top of that, it has a diverse plan selection, with discounts for 2-year and 1-year plans. Tap the button below, discover Surfshark, and watch Prime Video abroad in a few simple steps.\nCan\u2019t Change Your Prime Video Country? Here\u2019s the Fix!\nLike ESPN+ or Hulu, this streaming service is skillful at detecting VPN connections. If this happens, you\u2019ll see a so-called proxy error or the title you want to watch will still be unavailable. Either way, if things go south, consider NordVPN\u2019s browser extension.\nIn our tests, this extension has proven to be amazing at unblocking streaming services and if you already have NordVPN, it\u2019s easy to install it for free on your browser. From there:\n- Open NordVPN\u2019s browser extension and sign in.\n- Enable Location Spoofing and WebRTC Leak Protection.\n- Connect to a US server and watch Prime Video abroad.\nTry NordVPN\u2019s Browser Extension\nThis is the safest, most efficient route. However, if this doesn\u2019t work or you\u2019re not using NordVPN, you can try the other few fixes, such as:\n- Clearing your browser cache and cookies. We think this is paramount because accumulated browser data can divulge your original location to the site you\u2019re trying to visit.\n- Using another server. Try a few US-based servers and see if you have more luck. Some servers are more \u201coptimized\u201d for streaming than others.\n- Relying on another protocol. Instead of WireGuard, try OpenVPN TCP because it\u2019s great at overcoming censorship and accessing restricted sites. NordLynx and Lightway are phenomenal too and will likely work.\n- Watching Prime Video with a VPN on a different device. This one worked for us many times. If things aren\u2019t great on your Windows PC, switch to your Firestick, Smart TV, iPhone, or any other device and try again.\n- Using a different browser. This one is classic. Many times, our Brave browser made us stare into the \u201cproxy error\u201d message only to make everything work on Edge or Firefox.\n- Contacting customer support. No luck yet? This should be your go-to step. We\u2019re sure our VPNs\u2019 24/7 customer support teams will be helpful.\nDo Free VPNs Work With Prime Video?\nWe often get this question but the answer is the same as it was 2, 3, or 10 years ago.\nNo.\nThis delicate streaming platform relentlessly detects VPNs, preventing even premium providers from functioning normally. As you saw, we cherry-picked only five providers and tested at least 100. This explains how hard it is to watch Prime Video outside the US.\nOf course, you can always try a few providers to see how they\u2019ll work for you. In particular, Proton VPN has a great free variant with limitless traffic and a few servers in the US. After testing it, we noted that it\u2019s always detected by this streaming service but you can try and see if you\u2019re lucky enough.\nBe aware of free providers and their business practices, though. Proton VPN, Hide.me, PrivadoVPN, and Windscribe are safe enough. On the other side, you have providers like Hola, Betternet, Urban-VPN, and others whose logging is extremely intrusive.\nThey\u2019ll bury your privacy six feet deep because of logging your browsing history, IP address, location, etc. Sacrificing your privacy isn\u2019t the focal point of using the best VPN for Amazon Prime Video. You want privacy, security, AND the ability to access this platform.\nConclusion\nThe providers we presented are undoubtedly the most reputable Prime Video VPNs. Apart from this service, they\u2019ll unblock dozens of others, including channels that stream MotoGP for free or anything else. As said, the key is to obtain an IP address from a different country.\nIf you do this with our recommended VPNs for Amazon Prime, you\u2019ll face success. Such a change grants access to another library, where you\u2019ll find different content. NordVPN is the pack leader, while ExpressVPN is a tad behind, being nearly as reliable overall.\nPrivate Internet Access is your budget\u2019s best friend, while Proton VPN combines streaming with top-tier privacy. Finally, Surfshark is for people focused primarily on streaming and unblocking ample geo-restricted content. Enough lecturing \u2013 time to watch Prime Video abroad with one of the 5 amazing providers.\nWatch Prime Video anywhere with NordVPN\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhy can\u2019t I access certain shows on Amazon Prime Video?\nAmazon Prime Video content is geo-restricted. Some movies and series are only available in certain countries due to licensing agreements, so if you\u2019re outside that region, you won\u2019t be able to watch them.\nIs using a VPN for Amazon Prime Video legal?\nUsing a VPN is legal in most countries. However, bypassing geo-restrictions may violate Amazon Prime Video\u2019s terms of service, so you do it at your own risk.\nWill a VPN slow down my Prime Video streaming?\nIt can, but high-quality VPNs with fast servers (like NordVPN) usually have minimal impact. For HD or 4K streaming, choose a VPN with unlimited bandwidth and dedicated streaming servers.\nAre there alternatives to VPNs for changing Prime Video region?\nSmart DNS services can also unblock content by redirecting only your location data, but they don\u2019t encrypt traffic and are less reliable than VPNs."
