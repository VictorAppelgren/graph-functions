Also delete the mortgage‑specific portions of the risk discussion (“Key risks to this view include a potential Fed policy reversal driven by a sudden inflation spike…”, “Watching the Fed’s policy statements, the CPI/PCE releases, Treasury auction results, and the monthly mortgage‑originating volume…”) and replace them with a concise, DXY‑centric risk list that cites only Fed minutes, CPI/PCE, debt issuance, and the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread. Keep all sentences that directly tie Fed actions, term‑premium dynamics, and the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread to DXY movement, ensuring each contains an inline citation (e.g., (LF0UUL917), (B1KYJ1GPU), (Z7O1DCHS7)). The final draft should read exclusively about DXY, its causal chain, catalysts, and risk factors, with no mention of spx, mortgage rates, or equity indices.",
