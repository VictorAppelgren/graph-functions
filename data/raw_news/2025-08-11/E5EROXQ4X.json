  "title": "NYC students make gains in standardized tests \u2014 but 40% still failed reading and math",
  "description": "The percentage of New York City grades 3-8 students passing the state\u2019s standardized reading and math exams jumped this year, according to results released Monday.",
  "content": "More than 40% of grammar school students in the city failed the state\u2019s standardized math and reading texts this year \u2014 but officials praised some gains in the results released Monday.\n\nMore city public school in grades 3-8 passed the proficiency tests this year for English Language Arts and math than they did last year though critics contended those are small victories as the Big Apple\u2019s school spending tops $41 billion and the state\u2019s $36,293 per pupil tab is the highest in the nation.\n\nSome 56.3% of students met the proficiency standards for ELA, up 7.2-percentage points from the 49.1% who passed in 2024, according to the data.\n\nStudents making the grade in math bumped up 3.5-percentage points since 2024, from 53.4% to 56.9%, according to the figures.\n\nBoth pass percentages outpaced the state average while city reading and math scores increased across all grades. The largest gains were in Grade 3, which saw ELA increase by 12.9 percentage points, and Grade 6, which jumped 15 points, the figures showed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a positive that everything got better,\u201d said Danyela Souza, an education research fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a policy think tank. \u201cIt seems there\u2019s real progress in reading, particularly in grades 3 and 5. That\u2019s huge gains we\u2019re seeing,\n\nBut Souza said it\u2019s hard to tell if students have recovered from learning loss during the COVID-19 pandemic because the cut-off scores to pass have been lowered.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier now to pass than five years ago,\u201d she said.\n\nThe city\u2019s gains mirror the ELA proficiency pass rate for all grade 3-to-8 students statewide, which jumped from 46% to 53% over the past year. The pass rate for math increased from 52% to 55%, according to the numbers.\n\nMayor Eric Adams, who is running for re-election this fall applauded the results, claiming the new phonics-based \u201cNYC Reads\u201d programs and \u201cNYC Solves\u201d math curriculum instituted during their tenure have contributed to student gains.\n\n\u201cThese academic gains in English Language Arts and math are a testament to what\u2019s possible when we invest in our young people and believe in their potential, and we are proud of our students, teachers, and the entire school community,\u201d Adams said.\n\nSchools Chancellor Aviles-Ramos said the results showed \u201ckids rise to the occasion\u201d when administrators set high expectations and provide educators the proper tools.\n\n\u201cWe are closing gaps, raising achievement in every borough, and making sure more students than ever are on track for long-term success,\u201d Aviles-Ramos said. \u201cThis is what happens when we stay focused on evidence-based instruction and never lose sight of what\u2019s possible for our young people.\u201d\n\nFor example, 75% of Asian and 73% of white students were proficient in English, compared to 47% of black students and 43.5% of Hispanic students, according to the numbers.\n\nIn math, 80.8% of Asian students and 75% of white students were proficient compared to 43% of both black and Hispanic students.\n\nCritics have also said it\u2019s difficult to determine where New York students stand compared to kids elsewhere. A better indicator may be results of the \u201cNation\u2019s Report Card\u201d \u2014 National Assessment of Educational Progress \u2014 which includes scores from students from all over the country.\n\nNew York students performed dismally on those exams, with results released earlier this year showing two-thirds of fourth graders in the city weren\u2019t proficient in math or reading.\n\nA state Education Department spokesperson insisted \u201cno test is harder or easier to pass from year to year\u201d and that the scaling method used is based on the difficulty of questions on a particular test.",

      "text": "New York\u2019s schools are failing our children.\nA bombshell Citizens Budget Commission report exposes the rank insanity of New York spending on public schools: Combining federal, state and local outlays, it\u2019s now up $36,293 per student, \u201cthe highest in the nation and nearly twice the national average.\u201d\nEven as \u201cstudent performance is middle-of-the-pack\u201d: By the Urban Institute\u2019s calculations, adjusting for demographics, New York kids collectively place an average of 18th or 19th among the states on the gold-standard performance measure, the National Assessment of Educational Progress.\nThat per-student spending figure is a huge jump even from 2021, when it was $29,873. (That, by the way, is the basis for the \u201cnearly twice the national average\u201d finding: The CBC doesn\u2019t yet have current national data.)\nWhy did it soar? Salary increases, pension costs and because the state has decided not to reduce aid to districts with declining enrollment, even as statewide public-school head count is down 7.7% since the 2012-13 school year.\nGov. Hochul had proposed declining-enrollment cuts in the state-aid formula, but the Legislature wouldn\u2019t have it, so as usual she backed off.\nSo New York school districts are set to spend an eye-popping $89 billion (with $39 billion coming from state coffers) in the 2024-25 school year \u2014 up 21% from four years ago.\nThank the power of the state\u2019s teachers unions, which go ballistic at any mention of education \u201ccuts\u201d and torpedo all efforts at accountability. They\u2019d rather trap kids in failing classrooms that do anything to consolidate schools or insist on improvement.\nThey\u2019re also choking the growth of charter schools, which mainly avoid unionization and deliver far more educational bang for the taxpayer buck.\nIn New York City, charters get less than half the per-pupil funding of the regular public schools, even as charter students do markedly better on state exams and other standardized tests.\nMeanwhile, the Board of Regents and State Education Department, under the control of the unions and the Legislature\u2019s progressives, are working to eliminate any meaningful standards for high-school graduation.\nEvery kid with a pulse will get a diploma, and the educrats will cheer the \u201cexcellence\u201d they\u2019ve achieved.\nThe special interests are robbing the public blind in the name of educating New York\u2019s kids, and it\u2019s getting rapidly worse: Again, per-student outlays are up 21% in just these last four years.\nWe\u2019ve already called for the Trump\u2019s Education Department to investigate the state\u2019s bureaucracy, but it\u2019s up to New York voters to hold Hochul and (especially) the Legislature to account: The folks in charge in Albany are exploiting the children to plunder the public."

      "text": "Gov. Kathy Hochul announces plan to get school reading instruction \u2018back to basics\u2019\nNew York needs to get back to the basics when it comes to teaching kids how to read, Gov. Kathy Hochul says.\nThe Governor announced Wednesday that she wants to ditch the trendy \u201cwhole language\u201d method of teaching English and get back to drilling kids on phonics and reading comprehension.\n\u201cDespite the best efforts, it\u2019s showing that it\u2019s not working anymore,\u201d Hochul said of the state\u2019s new reading plan, dubbed \u201cBack to Basics,\u201d at an elementary school in Watervliet, NY.\n\u201cI think every child should have the best shot in life, the best shot to learn how to read, the best shot to become completely literate by the time they leave school.\u201d\nThe whole language approach teaches children to read entire words and try to understand their meaning within context. Proponents of whole language thought that by battering kids with words again and again, they would pick up the meaning within context. The children\u2019s series \u201cDick and Jane\u201d being a prime example.\nPhonics teaches by piecing together or decoding parts of words to connect them together and understand their meaning, but that style was ditched by mainstream educators in the early 2000\u2019s.\n\u201cAbout 20 years ago, they thought \u2018it\u2019s whole different way of learning, why don\u2019t we just put kids in a room with books and they\u2019ll figure it out?\u2019 Do you think that\u2019s very smart?,\u201d Hochul asked the audience at her announcement, which included some fourth graders in the front row.\n\u201cNo,\u201d one tot retorted.\nA growing swath of researchers and activist organizations agree with the fourth grader.\nAn NAACP chapter has gone as far as petitioning Oakland, Ca. schools, demanding they teach traditional phonics, framing it as a civil rights issue, citing disproportionately lower literacy rates amongst Black, Latino and Asian American Pacific Islander students.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just science, it\u2019s common sense,\u201d Hochul said.\nThe Governor\u2019s proposal is backed by the powerful state teacher\u2019s union, school administrators, and the New York State Parent Teachers Association.\n\u201cThese policies are not merely the results of the latest fad,\u201d NYSUT President Melinda Person said. \u201cI want to be really clear about this. This is the result of decades of research, brain science information from 10s of 1000s of studies, that is driving us toward this change in instructional practice.\u201d\n\u201cNYS PTA is excited that Governor Hochul is supporting our great educators, schools, families and children in this important work,\u201d New York PTA President Helen Hoffman wrote in a statement. \u201cThe science of reading instruction has certainly changed over the years, and with this new infusion of resources, support for the important work classroom teachers do each day will be expanded.\nThe proposed state legislation builds off a sweeping overhaul of elementary literacy instruction rolled out by the Adams\u2019 administration in half of the Big Apple\u2019s school districts in May last year.\nThe program known as NYC Reads requires city schools to choose between three sets of approved curriculums that focus on reading education for elementary school students.\n\u201cFor far too long, we gave our teachers the wrong literacy playbook and our students suffered. Thanks to Mayor Adams and Chancellor Banks, NYC Reads is leading the way in revolutionizing literacy instruction through the \u2018Science of Reading,\u2019\u201d Nicole Brownstein a spokesperson for NYC Public Schools told the Post.\n\u201cHowever, our work will be hampered without significant changes at the teacher preparation programs.\n\u201cWe commend Governor Hochul for amplifying and expanding NYC\u2019s clarion call by making literacy a priority for all of New York\u2019s students and are thrilled to have her support in giving our teachers the training and tools they need to shift how we teach our children to read.\u201d\nSpeaking anonymously to the Post a Long Island mom of two elementary school students and a special education high school teacher in literacy intervention told the Post while she overwhelmingly supports the proposal she foresees some hurdles.\n\u201cI think for the new teachers that aren\u2019t locked into a routine this will be an easy transition,\u201d she said.\n\u201cFor those that have been teaching for 20 years and came up and saw success for half of their students over the years with the Teachers College Reading program this will be a difficult transition.\u201d\n\u201cBut those are the ones that need it the most. They need to realize that most of their students struggle to learn to read and this will be a good thing.\u201d\nThere are 685 school districts in the state, not including New York City.\nRay Domanico, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, told the Post that it\u2019s important that the state education department \u201cworks to build support in those districts for the new approach.\u201d\n\u201cYes, money for training will help, but it is critical for the state to be open about which programs they will approve and why they are choosing those programs,\u201d he said.\n\u201cEven under the best of circumstances, this will take more than a single year, but the state should require districts to begin the effort and to demonstrate yearly progress.\u201d\nDomanico added that the details of the legislation will make all the difference, specifically how the state will ensure that every district is using \u201cevidence-based practices\u201d and how they\u2019ll police those who don\u2019t demonstrate compliance.\nThe governor said she plans to include her plan in her state budget proposal which is due later this month. If it\u2019s included in the state budget, it would direct the state department of education to craft regulations for schools to implement into their curriculums. Hochul said she wants schools to adopt the changes by 2025."

      "text": "NYC students score far below state, national averages on SAT, marking some of the lowest scores in years\nNew York City students scored far below the rest of the state and country on the SAT \u2014 producing the lowest average scores in at least seven years, troubling new data show.\nPublic school students in the Big Apple scored an average 473 on the math portion of last year\u2019s standardized test, which is widely used for college admissions in the US. It was a whopping 71 points below the average for the rest of New York, and 32 points below that of the rest of the country.\nReading and writing scores remained flat, with NYC students averaging 482, the same as 2023 \u2014 but the rest of the state and country again far outperformed the city, with average scores of 553 and 519, respectively.\nThe math, reading and writing portions of the test are each scored out of 800, making the highest possible score a 1600.\n\u201cIt\u2019s another wake up call for New York City Public Schools to concentrate on improved instruction in core subjects,\u201d remarked David Bloomfield, an educator professor at Brooklyn College and the CUNY Graduate Center.\nThe Big Apple\u2019s SAT flop continued a steady decline that began in 2022 and marked the lowest average scores in at least seven years, according to data released by the city Department of Education Friday.\nThe tests are typically administered from August through June. A school-by-school or borough breakdown was not immediately available.\nBloomfield was shocked by an especially wide gap between Asian and white test takers compared to Black and Hispanics.\nPerformance among each demographic on the math portion dropped in NYC compared to 2023. Asian students scored an average 582, down four points from the year before, and white students averaged a 536, down eight points from the year prior.\nBut Hispanic students scored an average of 430 on the math section \u2014 more than 100 points less than their white counterparts and five points less than they did the year before. Black students scored an average of 426, down two points from 2023, and 118 points lower than the rest of the state\u2019s average.\nNationally, math scores dropped by three points, and statewide, they ticked down one point.\nAsian kids in NYC did better in reading and writing compared to last year, however, while white students dropped from an average of 555 to 549. Black students\u2019 reading and writing average went up slightly, from 446 to 449, while Hispanic kids\u2019 average dropped 1 point to 445.\nAcross the country, the reading and writing average dropped one point, while the rest of New York, not including the city, increased by one point.\n\u201cThese results are a reminder that we need to keep expanding access to academic support \u2014 especially for students who haven\u2019t traditionally had it,\u201d said Frances Kweller, director of the Manhattan- and Queens-based tutoring company Kweller Prep.\n\u201cThe population of students in New York City compared to the rest of the state, compared to the rest of the country, is poorer and has more kids of color, more special ed kids and more immigrants who whose native language is other than English,\u201d Eric Nadelstern, who was the deputy chancellor for instruction at the DOE under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, told The Post.\n\u201cThose are the factors that I think account for the disparity in SAT scores,\u201d he added, noting also that students who took the test last year were starting high school when COVID-19 lockdowns hit.\nNYC students\u2019 participation in the exam dropped from 71.5% of graduating students taking the exam in 2023 to 70.9% last year. The only demographic whose participation increased were Asians.\nThe College Board, which administers the SAT, transitioned the test to a fully digital format in the spring of 2024.\nMany colleges stopped requiring SAT and ACT scores during the pandemic, but have recently reversed course.\n\u201cColleges are moving back to \u2018test required\u2019 precisely because they have seen a direct correlation between SAT and ACT performance and college readiness and success,\u201d said Linda Quarles, a Brooklyn Tech parent and vice president of the Citywide Council on High Schools.\nLeo Niyazov, an 11th-grader at Brooklyn Technical High School and student at Kweller Prep, knows preparing for the SAT will up his chances of getting into West Point.\n\u201cEven though many colleges are test-optional now, West Point still requires the SAT \u2026 A strong SAT score helps strengthen my whole application,\u201d he said.\nAvish Jain, another Brooklyn Tech 11th-grader, is doing test prep in the hopes that his SAT score helps him get into college on scholarship.\n\u201cI wish more support was available in schools,\u201d he said.\nDOE spokeswoman Jenna Lyle pointed to new data that shows 12% more NYC students passed Advanced Placement exams in 2024 than the year before.\n\u201cWe\u2019re proud that our students are challenging themselves \u2013 and doing better than ever before \u2013 as evidenced by last year\u2019s Advanced Placement exam results,\u201d Lyle told The Post.\n\u201cIn line with national trends, we\u2019ve seen SAT scores dip as more students opt to not retake the test, likely due to increased SAT-optional policies at colleges across the country,\u201d she added."

  "argos_summary": "More than 40% of grammar school students in New York City failed state standardized math and reading tests this year, despite some improvements in proficiency rates for English Language Arts and math. Critics argue that these gains are minimal given the city's high education spending, which exceeds $41 billion annually. The results also highlight significant racial disparities in student performance, with Black and Hispanic students scoring notably lower than their Asian and white peers. Additionally, recent SAT scores for NYC students were the lowest in seven years, further emphasizing the need for educational reform.",
