  "title": "Eric Adams adviser accused of bribery after giving reporter cash inside potato chip bag",
  "description": "Winnie Greco, who resigned from City Hall amid controversy, gave a journalist cash stuffed into an empty bag of sour cream and onion potato chips.",
  "content": "A former City Hall adviser to New York City Mayor Eric Adams and, until Thursday, Aug. 21, a volunteer for his reelection campaign, reportedly gave a local reporter a wad of cash stuffed inside a bag of potato chips.\n\nThe non-profit news outlet The City reported the encounter late Wednesday, Aug. 20, a few hours after Winnie Greco allegedly handed an open bag of Herr's sour cream and onion rippled potato chips to journalist Katie Honan following a Harlem campaign event. Initially, Honan thought it was simply a \u201clight snack,\u201d but after they parted ways, she looked inside the bag and discovered a red envelope containing \u201cat least one $100 bill and several $20 bills.\u201d\n\nHonan texted Greco soon after the discovery to let her know she couldn't accept the money and asked when she could return it. However, she did not receive a response.\n\nThe City reported the incident to the NYC Department of Investigation, and federal prosecutors from the office of Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Joseph Nocella contacted The City\u2019s lawyers, as reported by the outlet. An investigator later retrieved the chip bag that contained the red envelope and cash.\n\nAdams and his broader campaign didn't have any immediate ties to the incident.\n\nA spokesperson for the Brooklyn U.S. attorney's office, John Marzulli, declined to comment when contacted by USA TODAY. Greco's attorney denied the incident was a payoff, according to a statement.\n\nIn a statement to The City and the New York Times, a spokesperson for Adams\u2019 campaign said Greco has been suspended from all volunteer campaign-related activities and holds no position in the campaign.\n\n\u201cMayor Adams had no prior knowledge of this matter,\u201d spokesperson Todd Shapiro said. \u201cHe has always demanded the highest ethical and legal standards, and his sole focus remains on serving the people of New York City with integrity.\u201d\n\nWith less than three months remaining until the general election, Adams is facing significant headwinds in his bid for a second term due to a scandal-filled tenure and consistently low polling numbers. The City and reporter Honan, who previously covered New York City for the Wall Street Journal, have reported extensively on the Adams administration, including on his federal indictment in 2024 and ongoing investigations and indictments of multiple former Adams staffers and associates. Honan's reporting has also focused on Greco\u2019s relationship with Adams.\n\nWinnie Greco, the former director of Asian affairs for the city, has been a fixture in Adams' campaigns and the current administration. She has been a key fundraiser and acted as the main liaison between Adams and the Chinese American community.\n\nShe resigned from her post at City Hall in October 2024 amid scrutiny over her close relationships with people and groups connected to China\u2019s communist regime, and after FBI agents searched two of her Bronx homes in March 2024 in connection with the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn.\n\nAlthough she no longer holds a position at City Hall, Greco has recently reemerged alongside Adams as he campaigns for a second term.\n\nIn an interview with The City on Wednesday, Aug. 20, Greco was asked what her intention was in handing money to the reporter. In response, the news outlet reported she said she\u2019d made a mistake and apologized.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\" she told The City. \"It\u2019s a culture thing. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m so sorry. I feel so bad right now. I\u2019m so sorry, honey.\u201d In a separate call later that evening, Greco said: \"I just wanted to be her friend. I just wanted to have one good friend. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\nGreco's attorney, Steven Brill, in a statement to The City, called the money a gesture of friendship and gratitude in Chinese culture. He also told USA TODAY in a statement that while it \"looks odd,\" it would make more sense and carry less negative connotation \"if one understood Winnie's generosity, and her sincere dedication to the Chinese culture.\" He told USA TODAY that Greco \"apologized and asked for the traditional gift to be returned\" once the reporter alerted her that she could not accept the money.\n\n\"This was no payoff. This was no bag of cash in a dark alley,\" Brill said. \"Any insinuation that this gift had a nefarious intent to influence this reporter or her coverage is misinterpreted and ridiculous.\"\n\nThe reports of Greco's attempted cash handoff to the reporter came hours before a new set of indictments was announced against another former Adams adviser.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney announced on Thursday, Aug. 21, that former adviser Ingrid Lewis-Martin was under investigation for accusations that she engaged in several bribery schemes.\n\nAdams became the first sitting New York City mayor to face federal indictment last year, after charges were filed in September 2024 claiming he solicited and accepted illegal gifts and campaign donations from wealthy foreigners, including accepting luxury airline tickets, meals, and hotel stays. The mayor pleaded not guilty and has maintained his innocence. In April, the Department of Justice, under President Donald Trump, dismissed the corruption case against Adams. The controversial decision spurred more than half a dozen senior federal prosecutors to resign, and sparked a public outcry.\n\nAdams has been in NYC's public eye for decades, formerly serving as an NYPD Captain, a state senator and Brooklyn borough president. He was elected as mayor in 2021.\n\nKathryn Palmer is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY. You can reach her atkapalmer@usatoday.com and on X @KathrynPlmr.",

      "text": "NYC Mayor Eric Adams' corruption case dismissed; charges can't be refiled\nA federal judge on Wednesday dismissed the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, although without the strings attached that had been sought by the Department of Justice.\nU.S. District Judge Dale Ho dismissed the case with prejudice, meaning the charges cannot be refiled at a later date. The DOJ's request for a dismissal without prejudice could have left the Democratic mayor beholden to President Donald Trump's administration, which considers Adams an ally in its immigration crackdown.\n\"Dismissing the case without prejudice would create the unavoidable perception that the Mayor's freedom depends on his ability to carry out the immigration enforcement priorities of the administration, and that he might be more beholden to the demands of the federal government than to the wishes of his own constituents,\" the judge wrote.\nProsecutors had asked for the right to bring charges again\nThe decision comes weeks after a court-appointed attorney, Paul D. Clement, counseled Ho to dismiss the indictment with prejudice. Ho selected Clement, who was a solicitor general under President George W. Bush, to present arguments against the prosecutors' bid to dismiss the charges in part because Adams and the DOJ were aligned in their positions.\nFederal prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss the corruption charges against Adams in February, arguing that Adams can't effectively cooperate on immigration enforcement if he is fighting a corruption case. But prosecutors also asked for the right to bring the charges again.\nHo, however, wrote that the DOJ's assertion is \"unsubstantiated,\" noting that Adams took at least one new immigration-related action while the indictment was pending: allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement to operate at the Rikers Island Jail Complex, a decision Ho said \"appears to be contrary to New York City law.\"\n\"Everything here smacks of a bargain: dismissal of the Indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions,\" Ho wrote.\nAdams pleaded not guilty in September\nAdams pleaded not guilty in September to charges of accepting free travel and political donations from Turkish officials to take actions that benefitted their country. He has maintained his innocence.\n\u201cAs I said from the outset, I never broke the law and I never will. I never put any personal benefit above my solemn responsibility as your mayor,\" Adams said in a video statement in mid-February. \u201cI absolutely never traded my power as an elected official for personal benefit.\u201d\nHo stressed that his decision not to deny the DOJ's motion altogether is not a reflection of Adams' guilt or innocence. The judge wrote that while the court cannot force the government to prosecute a defendant, it can \"shine a light on the reasons that DOJ has decided to dismiss this case, leaving the most important judgment to the public.\"\nAdams, now running for reelection, has been under pressure to resign since the indictment. But New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said she would not oust Adams from office and would instead seek to impose strict new guidelines on his administration.\nContributing: Lauren Villagran, USA TODAY; Reuters"

      "text": "Obama calls Texas GOP redistricting an 'assault' on democracy\nFormer President Barack Obama is throwing his support behind Texas Democrats as the battle over redistricting continues to develop in the Lone Star state.\nThe former president participated in a call with Texas House Democrats on Thursday, Aug. 14, and expressed his support for the delegation as most of its members remain out of state in an attempt to stymie their GOP colleagues' effort to pass a new congressional map. Their redrawing of congressional boundaries mid-decade, and not during a census year as is the norm, could add up to five more Republican seats to Congress in the run-up to the 2026 midterm elections \u2013 if the measure passes.\nIn an Aug. 14 post on X, Obama praised the Texas Democrats, building on his initial public condemnation of Republicans' push to add five new GOP congressional seats more than a week earlier.\nThe former Democratic president has taken a more subdued role in politics since leaving office, and again since a brief return to the national spotlight to support his party in the 2024 election.\n\"I am so proud of the @TexasHDC and the work that they\u2019ve done,\" Obama wrote, resharing a post from the Texas House Democrats thanking him for his support. \"Their willingness to put themselves on the line to highlight the current assault on our democracy has set an example for what all of us have to do.\"\nObama first jumped into the fray in an Aug. 5 post, calling Texas Republicans' push to add five new GOP congressional seats \"a power grab that undermines our democracy.\"\nThe state's battle has ballooned into a multi-state skirmish since Democrats fled their home state Aug. 3, blocking Republicans' attempts to vote on the new maps. In the days that followed, Texas' Republican Gov. Greg Abbott ordered arrest warrants for the Democrats who fled, and Trump suggested the FBI may have to force them back to the state. Abbot said in a statement earlier in the week that he intended to call for a second legislative session, after Texas' House and Senate signaled both chambers would adjourn on Friday, Aug. 15, due to the lack of a quorum prompted by the absent Democrats.\nDemocratic lawmakers, such as New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, have taken a confrontational stance toward the proposed map, with several governors hosting the Texas Democrats after they fled. Hochul said Democrats will \"fight fire with fire\" and counter Texas Republicans' planned redistricting, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Aug. 14 that his state would hold a special election Nov. 4 to ask voters to approve a mid-decade redistricting plan that would likely advantage Democrats in the deeply blue state.\nSomewhat of a map-drawing arms race has ensued, with Republican-led states such as Florida and Ohio looking to redistrict in response.\n'Stand up and fight'\nIn their post thanking Obama for attending the meeting, Texas Democrats shared a photo of the president on a large screen in front of more than a dozen attendees.\n\"Your words reminded us why we broke quorum: Democracy isn't self-executing. It requires us to stand up and fight for it,\" the caucus said in its post. \"We're honored by your support.\"\nPublic opinion on gerrymandering\nIn a recent national poll, public opinion about redrawing maps, referred to as gerrymandering, appeared mixed.\nMore than two-thirds said partisan gerrymandering should not be allowed in the YouGov/Economist poll conducted Aug. 9-11. Yet when asked if it should be allowed in retaliation to another party redrawing its maps, 35% said it would be ok, and 30% said no. Another 36% said they were not sure.\nKathryn Palmer is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY. You can reach her at kapalmer@usatoday.com and on X @KathrynPlmr."

      "text": "Trump approval holds at 40%, lowest of his term, Reuters/Ipsos poll finds\nWASHINGTON, Aug 18 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's approval rating held at 40% in recent weeks, matching the lowest level of his current term, amid weak ratings from Hispanic voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll that closed on Monday.\nThe six-day poll was conducted as economic data showed signs the U.S. labor market is weakening and as Trump oversees a sweeping immigration crackdown, while at the same time the Republican has been engaged in intense diplomacy to end a war between Russia and Ukraine.\nTrump's approval rating was unchanged from a late July Reuters/Ipsos poll, but has dropped seven percentage points since his first days back in the White House in January, when 47% of Americans gave him a thumbs-up.\nThe latest poll showed Hispanics, a group that swung toward Trump in last year's election, have also soured on the president. Some 32% approved of his performance in the White House, matching their lowest level of approval for Trump this year.\nMore than half of respondents -- 54%, including one in five Republicans -- said they thought Trump was too closely aligned with Russia, even as he ramped up a push to broker peace between Moscow and Kyiv. Trump has appeared to embrace Russia's claim that Ukraine must cede territory to Russia in order for the war to stop.\nTrump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, and the poll closed just ahead of the president's meeting on Monday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.\nJust 42% of respondents approved of Trump's performance on crime and 43% thought he was doing a good job on immigration policy. On all policies, Trump's support came overwhelmingly from Republicans.\nAfter returning to the White House in January, Trump ordered a sweeping crackdown on people living in the country illegally, deploying masked agents to arrest and deport migrants across the country. The policy has triggered mass protests in cities including Los Angeles, where about half the population identifies as Latino and many people have family members who are recent immigrants.\nMore recently, Trump ordered federal agents and National Guard troops to aid in law enforcement in Washington, D.C., arguing that crime was rampant there. Statistics show that violent crime shot up in 2023 but has been rapidly declining since.\nThe Reuters/Ipsos poll surveyed 4,446 U.S. adults nationwide and online and had a margin of error of about 2 percentage points.\n(Reporting by Jason Lange; editing by Scott Malone and Deepa Babington)"

      "text": "Who are the European leaders meeting with Trump and Zelenskyy?\nPresident Donald Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and top European leaders at the White House on Monday, Aug. 18 following his one-day Alaska summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nThe coalition of European leaders, all longtime supporters of Ukraine amid its war with Russia, traveled to Washington, DC, as a group to shore up Zelenskyy's position, as Trump continues to push for a peace deal to end the more than three-year-long war.\nHere is what to know about the group of foreign leaders that accompanied Zelenskyy on his trip to the White House on Aug. 18.\nWho were the leaders joining Zelenskyy at the White House?\nThe European leaders joining the meeting were United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, President of the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.\nWho is British Prime Minister Keir Starmer?\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the country's fourth prime minister in less than two years, stepped into office July 2024. His election was a landslide for the Labour Party, ejecting the Conservatives from power after five consecutive Conservative prime ministers held Downing Street.\nThe UK has been a leading supporter of Ukraine since Russia's February 2022 invasion, and it is one of the leading donors of military assistance to Ukraine, alongside the U.S. and Germany, according to a recent briefing from the House of Commons Library. The UK has pledged more than $16 billion in aid since the war began, as of the June 2025 report, of which $10 billion is for military aid.\nIn a statement released ahead of the Aug. 18 summit, Starmer reaffirmed the UK's support of Ukraine, threatening increased sanctions on Russia in response to the ongoing war. \"Our unwavering support for Ukraine will continue as long as it takes,\" he said.\nWho is Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni?\nGiorgia Meloni has been Italy's prime minister since October 2022. She is Italy's first female prime minister and the country's first far-right leader since World War II.\nItaly is one of six founding members of the EU and it's the bloc\u2019s third-largest economy. In the past, Italy has played a valuable role as a bridge between Europe and antagonistic governments in Russia and China, and in some Middle Eastern nations. As with most of EU member states, and similiar to the five other leaders joining her in Washington, DC, Aug. 18, Italy has been a steadfast ally of Ukraine throughout the war.\nIn a joint statement following Trump's meeting with Putin in Alaska on Friday, Aug. 15, Meloni joined several other EU leaders in a pledge to support Ukraine, saying the nation must have \"ironclad\" security guarantees to defend its territorial integrity in any peace negotiations.\n\"Our support to Ukraine will continue. We are determined to do more to keep Ukraine strong in order to achieve an end to the fighting and a just and lasting peace,\" the Aug.. 16 statement said.\nWho is French President Emmanuel Macron?\nFrance's president Emmanuel Macron has led the country since May 2017, and cruised into a second term in 2022 against Marine Le Pen, a far-right populist who attacked the European Union and NATO, and expressed support for Russia.\nIn the early days of the war, Macron fashioned himself as one of Europe's key mediators in the burgeoning conflict, and attempted to establish dialogues with Putin to end the war, though they proved unsuccessful. As of late, Macron has taken a leading role in Europe's push to keep Trump from legitimizing Putin and rewarding the Russian invasion with a hurried deal to end the Ukraine war.\nMacron was the first European leader to visit the White House since Trump's return to office earlier this year.\nWho is German Chancellor Friedrich Merz?\nAmong the four European heads of state who have descended on the White House for the talks, Friedrich Merz is the newest to office, after winning election in May 2025. He is the leader of the center-right Christian Democratic Union party, and heads Europe's largest state economy.\nGermany's decision to send military aid to Ukraine in 2022 marked a significant reversal in the country's long-standing position of never sending offensive weapons to conflict zones. Among European nations, it is among the top providers of aid to Ukraine. According to a May 2025 report from the German government, this aid includes equipment and weapons such as air defense systems, combat vehicles, artillery systems, armored transport vehicles, small arms, and ammunition, as well as other types of support, including medical supplies and clothing. Between the start of the year and May 2025, the report says total German aid to Ukraine exceeds $50 billion.\nWho is Finnish President Alexander Stubb?\nAlexander Stubb is the president of Finland, making him the only leader at the White House meeting representing a nation that borders Russia. He was elected in February 2024, roughly a year after the country joined NATO. A member of the conservative National Coalition Party party, he previously served as the prime minister, finance minister, foreign minister, trade, and Europe minister of Finland.\nFinland has committed more than $4 billion in aid to Ukraine since the war began, according to its Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nWho is European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen?\nUrsula von der Leyen has been president of the European Commission since 2019, and is the first woman to hold the post. She was a lawmaker in Germany prior to taking the position, serving in Germany's legislature and as Federal Minister of Defence, among other roles. In her capacity as president, she manages the organization of the European Commission, including on matters of policy, and often represents the body in international meetings and summits.\nIt's the second meeting von der Leyen has had with the U.S. president in as many months, following a July 27 meeting at one of Trump's luxury golf courses in Scotland, where they reached a U.S.-EU trade deal.\n\"Since the beginning of Russia's brutal invasion, Europe has been at Ukraine's side, united, and we will support you for as long as it takes for a just and lasting peace,\" she said in an Aug. 16 statement following a meeting with Ukraine's president. \"And this peace must be achieved through strength.\"\nWho is NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte?\nMark Rutte is NATO's secretary-general. He took office in October 2024 and was formerly Prime Minister of the Netherlands from October 2010 to July 2024.\nNATO is an intergovernmental military alliance with two North American countries \u2013 the U.S. and Canada \u2013 and 28 European countries. Founded in 1949 after the end of World War II, NATO is the \u201clargest peacetime military alliance in the world,\u201d according to the U.S. Department of State. Ukraine is not a NATO member, but a NATO partner country, which means that it cooperates closely with NATO but it is not covered by the security guarantee in the Alliance\u2019s founding treaty. The prospect of joining NATO is a major sticking point in potential peace talks, with Ukraine wanting the security alliance and Russia strongly opposing it, with Putin long considering NATO's existence and its continued growth as a threat.\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard, Francesca Chambers, USA TODAY; Reuters.\nKathryn Palmer is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "'Like a horror movie': LGBTQ+ community speaks out against same-sex marriage appeal\n\"These regressions feel like ... a horror movie, where the killer just makes this one more revival and the audience gasps because you thought everybody was safe,\" Jeremy Atherton Lin said.\nExhausting and terrifying. That's how Jeremy Atherton Lin described the recent appeal that seeks to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, the 10-year-old Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage in the United States.\nOn July 24, former Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis filed an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court about $100,000 she was ordered to pay to a gay couple to whom she refused to issue a marriage license in 2015 because of her religious beliefs.\n\"The High Court now has the opportunity to finally overturn this egregious opinion from 2015,\" Mat Staver, head of the conservative legal group Liberty Counsel, which is representing Davis, said in a statement.\nBut experts such as Kenneth Gordon, a marital and family lawyer in Florida, say the possibility of overturning Obergefell is a \"long shot.\" Obergefell is sound, from a legal perspective, Gordon said, and same-sex marriage is widely accepted by the general public.\nRegardless of the likelihood of Obergefell being overturned, some queer folks remain fearful about the future of their rights, especially in the wake of the Supreme Court's willingness to overturn Roe v. Wade and effectively end affirmative action in college admissions in recent years.\n\"These regressions feel like ... a horror movie, where the killer just makes this one more revival and the audience gasps because you thought everybody was safe,\" Atherton Lin told USA TODAY.\nAtherton Lin, who is now based in Britain, wrote extensively about the history of same-sex marriage in the United States in his new book, \"Deep House: The Gayest Love Story Ever Told.\" His second book, released in June, also provides readers with an inside look at his relationship with his husband of nearly 20 years. Atherton Lin's partner, whom he references as \"Famous\" in his books, wished to remain anonymous.\nWhere were you when Obergefell was announced?\nAtherton Lin couldn't recall exactly where he was or what he was doing when the Obergefell ruling was announced, but he and his husband had actually already tied their \"first\" knot with a civil partnership in the United Kingdom in 2007, he said.\nIn 2016, after the Obergefell ruling, the two converted their civil partnership to a marriage in the United States, Atherton Lin said.\nAaron Schekorra, executive director of The GLO Center, an LGBTQ+ resource center in southwest Missouri, \"vividly\" remembers when he learned of Obergefell.\n\"I was recently out of college,\" Schekorra told USA TODAY. \"I took my lunch break early and went and sat in a drive-through and just cried. I had to get away from my desk to have that sort of emotional release and that sense of relief. I was in a serious relationship at the time, and I was getting to the point where I should have been considering proposing. I didn't know if that was going to be something in my future.\"\nLike many LGBTQ+ folks, Schekorra didn't waste time. He bought an engagement ring the same week of the ruling, and by November 2015, he was married.\n\"Oftentimes people talk about it as just a marriage or just a relationship or something like that, but there's so much more that goes into it,\" Schekorra said.\nSchekorra has since divorced, but he said even that right is an important one.\nBrooke Friedman of Missouri also remembers where she was when she learned of the ruling: sitting with her family in their living room. Though she was not yet out to her family, Friedman said the group's mood was high.\n\"We were excited that everybody could just love who they want,\" Friedman told USA TODAY.\nFriedman married her wife, Emillie Friedman, in October 2024. The two had met about three years before and quickly moved in with each other and got a dog.\nEmillie said the appeal shocks and scares her, especially because the two plan on having a child together soon. But she remains hopeful.\n\"Nothing is going to change the fact that Brooke and I are legally married. We are married in our hearts.\"\nWhat would happen if Obergefell was overturned?\nEven if Obergefell were overturned, same-sex marriages probably would remain protected in the United States. In 2022, former President Joe Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act into law, which, at the federal level, protects same-sex and interracial marriages.\nThis means a couple who get married in a state like California, where same-sex marriage is legal, would have the same rights in a state like Tennessee, even if that state outlawed gay marriage.\n(This story was updated to correct an inaccuracy.)\nContributing: Maureen Groppe\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

      "text": "Prosecutors ask to drop corruption case against NYC Mayor Eric Adams\nThe Department of Justice has filed a motion to dismiss its corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, the latest move in a row between the Trump administration and career US attorneys.\nSeven justice department lawyers, including the top US prosecutor in Manhattan, resigned over an order to drop the case.\nUS Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News on Friday that it was her understanding that the case against Adams would be \"dismissed today\".\nAdams was indicted last year on fraud and bribery charges. He denies any wrongdoing.\nThe request to drop the charges will require approval by a judge.\nEarlier in the week, acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove - Bondi's second-in-command - ordered the Manhattan federal prosecutor's office to end the case.\nBove argued that the case against Adams had \"restricted\" the mayor's ability to address \"illegal immigration and violent crime\" - two of President Donald Trump's key priorities.\nThe motion to dismiss the case, signed by Bove and two justice department lawyers, said that pursuing the case \"would interfere with the defendant's ability to govern in New York City, which poses unacceptable threats to public safety, national security, and related federal immigration initiatives and policies\".\nBut several Department of Justice employees, including the top prosecutor in Manhattan, Danielle Sassoon, viewed the order to drop the case as politically motivated interference in the independent judicial system.\nSassoon resigned from her post on Thursday and was followed by six of her colleagues.\nShe said dropping the case would set a \"breathtaking and dangerous precedent\".\nThe latest prosecutor to resign in protest at being ordered to drop the charges, Hagan Scotten, wrote in his resignation letter on Friday that US laws and traditions do not allow for \"using prosecutorial power\" to influence elected officials.\n- Who is Danielle Sassoon, prosecutor who quit in protest from Trump justice department?\n- Foreign bribes, cheap flights: What is Eric Adams accused of?\n\"If no lawyer within earshot of the President is willing to give him that advice, then I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion,\" Scotten wrote in the letter addressed to Bove. \"But it was never going to be me.\"\nIn a letter accepting Sassoon's resignation, Bove said his office would be investigating the attorney, claiming she had \"lost sight of the oath that you took when you started at the Department of Justice\".\nIn a statement, Bondi's chief of staff Chad Mizelle defended the decision to dismiss the charges, saying it showed \"that this DOJ will return to its core function of prosecuting dangerous criminals, not pursuing politically motivated witch hunts\".\nMr Mizelle said that prosecutors who refuse direct orders \"have no place\" in the department.\nAdams was indicted last year for allegedly accepting gifts totalling more than $100,000 (\u00a375,000) from Turkish citizens in exchange for favours.\nIn Sassoon's resignation letter, she also said Adams' lawyers had met justice department officials and asked for a \"quid pro quo\", saying the New York City mayor could help enforce Trump's immigration policies if the case against him was dismissed.\nBut Adams denied that was the case.\n\"I want to be crystal clear with New Yorkers: I never offered - nor did anyone offer on my behalf - any trade of my authority as your mayor for an end to my case. Never,\" he said in a statement on Friday.\nAdams, a Democrat, has accused investigators of pursuing a politically motivated case against him because of his criticism of former President Joe Biden's immigration policies.\nThe New York mayor has also expressed a willingness to work with Trump since he won the White House. He flew to meet Trump at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida days before the Republican president took office.\nAfter a meeting with US border tsar Tom Homan on Thursday, Adams said he would agree to allow Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to re-establish an office at the city's Rikers Island jail.\nTrump has denied that he had any involvement in asking prosecutors to dismiss the case against Adams.\nBut Bove's letter described his instructions to drop the case as \"direct orders implementing the policy of a duly elected President\".\nThe governor of New York state, Kathy Hochul, has the power to remove Adams from office.\nWhile she has not said she would take such action, she also indicated she hasn't entirely ruled it out, telling MSNBC that she was \"consulting with other leaders in government at this time\".\n\"The allegations are extremely concerning and serious,\" she said. \"But I cannot, as the governor of this state, have a knee-jerk, politically motivated reaction.\""

      "text": "NYC Mayor Eric Adams will seek reelection as independent, blames criminal case for delay\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams announced Thursday morning that he will run for reelection as an independent after a scandal-plagued term.\nThe announcement comes the day after the Trump administration's Department of Justice formally dropped corruption charges against him. Adams blamed the criminal case for delaying his reelection campaign.\n\"There isn't a liberal way or conservative way to fix New York, but there is a right way and a wrong way,\" Adams said in video posted to X. \"Though I am still a Democrat, I am announcing that I will forgo the Democratic primary for mayor and appeal directly to all New Yorkers as an independent candidate in the general election.\"\nThe embattled mayor's 11th-hour decision means he will not face a crowded field of nine candidates, including former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, in June's Democratic primary.\nAdams was elected mayor in 2021. The primary election for the mayoral seat is June 24, 2025 and the general election is Nov. 4, 2025.\nAdams indicted on corruption charges, case dropped by Trump administration\nIn September, Adams was indicted on federal charges over allegations he accepted free travel and political donations from Turkish officials as bribes. It was the culmination of several probes into his administration as he led the biggest city in the U.S. He pleaded not guilty and has continuously denied wrongdoing.\nIn February, the Trump administration's DOJ intervened in the case, directing the prosecutors to drop it as it improperly interfered with Adams' reelection campaign. Initially, DOJ leadership wanted Adams to sign an agreement that charges could be filed against him again in the future.\nBut when the judge dismissed the case Wednesday, he did so with prejudice, meaning charges cannot be refiled in the future. Had the charges been dismissed without prejudice, Adams could have been beholden to the administration, which could have leveraged him in its immigration crackdown.\nWho is Eric Adams?\nEric Adams is the mayor of New York City, which includes five boroughs: Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx and Staten Island.\nAdams has been in NYC's public eye for decades, formerly serving as an NYPD Captain, a state senator and Brooklyn borough president. He was elected as mayor in 2021.\nAdams leads an overwhelmingly Democratic city and once aligned himself with former President Joe Biden. But Adams became critical of Biden when the city received a wave of migrants, and he has suggested his indictment was retribution for falling out with the Biden administration.\nTrump, who has argued that his own criminal charges against him were politicized, has appeared to have grown sympathetic towards Adams. Trump previously said he would consider pardoning the mayor.\n(This story has been updated with more information.)\nContributing: USA TODAY's John Bacon, N'dea Yancey-Bragg; Reuters\nKinsey Crowley is a trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

      "text": "A former top City Hall advisor and current campaign confidante to Mayor Eric Adams attempted to give money to a reporter from THE CITY following a campaign event in Harlem Wednesday.\nThe failed payoff \u2014 a wad of cash in a red envelope stuffed inside an opened bag of Herr\u2019s Sour Cream & Onion ripple potato chips \u2014 was made by Winnie Greco, a longtime Adams ally who resigned last year from her position as the mayor\u2019s liaison to the Asian community after she was targeted in multiple investigations. She resurfaced recently as a consistent presence in his re-election campaign.\nOn Wednesday, City Hall reporter Katie Honan spotted Greco near the announcement of the opening of Adams\u2019 newest campaign office, in Harlem. Greco later texted Honan after the event when she spotted her again and asked her to meet across the street from the campaign office next to a TD Bank.\nGreco and Honan walked to the Whole Foods next door. While inside the store, Greco handed Honan the opened bag of chips with the top crumpled closed. Honan, thinking it was an offer of a light snack, told Greco more than once she could not accept the chips, but Greco insisted that she keep them.\nThe two parted ways. Before entering a nearby subway station, Honan opened the bag and discovered a red envelope inside stuffed with cash, at least one $100 bill and several $20 bills. The reporter then called Greco and told her she could not accept the money and asked if she was still nearby so she could give it back. Greco said she\u2019d left the area. Honan told her she had to take the money back, and Greco said they could meet at some point in Chinatown.\nThe reporter then texted Greco, \u201cI can\u2019t take this, when can I give it back to you?\u201d She did not get a response.\nIn an interview later Wednesday, THE CITY asked Greco what her intention was in handing money to the reporter. In response, she said she\u2019d made \u201ca mistake\u201d and apologized over and over.\n\u201cI make a mistake,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s a culture thing. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t understand. I\u2019m so sorry. I feel so bad right now. I\u2019m so sorry, honey.\u201d\nShe then called THE CITY back, advising that we call her attorney, Steven Brill, and adding, \u201cCan we forget about this? I try to be a good person. Please. Please. Please don\u2019t do in the news nothing about me.\u201d\n\u201cI just wanted to be her friend,\u201d Greco added. \u201cI just wanted to have one good friend. It\u2019s nothing.\u201d\nBrill denied that his client\u2019s payment to THE CITY reporter was nefarious in any way.\n\u201cI can see how this looks strange,\u201d Brill said. \u201cBut I assure you that Winnie\u2019s intent was purely innocent. In the Chinese culture, money is often given to others in a gesture of friendship and gratitude. Winnie is apologetic and embarrassed by any negative impression or confusion this may have caused.\u201d\nAfter THE CITY informed the Adams campaign about the interaction with Greco, campaign spokesperson Todd Shapiro said Greco was immediately suspended from the campaign.\n\u201cWe are shocked by these reports,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cWinnie Grecco [sic] holds no position in this campaign and has been suspended from all VOLUNTEER campaign-related activities. Mayor Adams had no prior knowledge of this matter. He has always demanded the highest ethical and legal standards, and his sole focus remains on serving the people of New York City with integrity.\u201d\nFollowing the interaction at the Whole Foods, Honan brought the chips bag and envelope with money back to THE CITY\u2019s office and handed it over to her editors. THE CITY then contacted the city Department of Investigation (DOI). Anticipating possible law enforcement investigations, THE CITY did not open the envelope or count the money inside.\n\u201cDOI received allegations from THE CITY and declines further comment,\u201d said Diane Struzzi, DOI spokesperson.\nLater Wednesday, federal prosecutors from the office of Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Joseph Nocella contacted THE CITY\u2019s lawyers, and on Wednesday evening an investigator retrieved the chip bag containing the red envelope and cash.\nThe Brooklyn U.S. attorney has been investigating Greco since early last year after the FBI raided her homes in February 2024 following THE CITY\u2019s reporting on illegal straw donations raised at Adams\u2019 campaign fundraisers she\u2019d organized.\nThe DOI is also looking into allegations uncovered by THE CITY that she pressured a campaign volunteer to do personal tasks for her in exchange for getting him a city job.\nA Long History\nGreco has been a fixture of Adams\u2019 political career for over a decade, during which time she helped him raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for his mayoral campaigns and connected him to influential members of the Chinese-American community while escorting him on multiple trips abroad to China.\nShe served for much of that time as an unpaid, volunteer \u201cambassador\u201d to Brooklyn Borough Hall, while not taking any official roles for his political campaigns despite her prolific fundraising.\nAs part of the fundraising, she connected groups of campaign donors to Adams, with some contributors telling THE CITY and Documented in 2023 that they either did not give or were reimbursed by managers. Making donations under someone else\u2019s name is illegal under the city\u2019s public campaign finance program, which provides $8 for every $1 in small donations from New York City residents.\nGreco also helped raise funds for a nonprofit linked to Brooklyn Borough Hall as a board member of One Brooklyn, which touted Adams\u2019 initiatives and raised his profile ahead of his 2021 mayoral run.\nOver those same years, Greco also collected donations for a nonprofit organization of her own \u2014 with the stated goal of erecting a \u201cfriendship archway\u201d in Brooklyn\u2019s Chinatown that would serve as a gateway for businesses and culture. That venture, which relied on an archway being gifted by a district government of Beijing, collapsed, leaving some donors with questions about their contributions.\nHer first appointment to a paid government job came when Adams became mayor in January 2022. Within days of attending his New Year\u2019s Eve inauguration on a stage in Times Square with a small circle of close associates, Greco was named his Asian affairs director at a salary of $100,000, while her niece also landed a role at City Hall, eventually becoming one of the mayor\u2019s schedulers.\nGreco was so close to Adams and his inner circle that his senior advisor, Ingrid-Lewis Martin, was known to introduce Greco at events as \u201cmy sister.\u201d Lewis-Martin is currently being prosecuted by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for allegedly receiving bribes and is expected to be indicted Thursday on influence-peddling charges.\nIn November 2023, THE CITY reported on two instances where people who interacted with Greco alleged that she had misused her government position.\nA businessperson told THE CITY that Greco allegedly demanded $10,000 to her archway nonprofit as the cost of entry to a Chinese-themed event with Adams at Gracie mansion, for what was a free event.\nAdditionally, a campaign volunteer claimed that Greco promised to help him get a city job if he helped oversee renovations to her home in The Bronx, which he did. After he was hired by the Adams administration, Greco continued to compel him to assist her with construction-related tasks and other personal business while on the job, the aide claimed.\nIn an unusual arrangement, Greco also lived for nearly nine months in a two-room suite at a Queens hotel that was under city contract to house formerly incarcerated individuals.\nThe mayor\u2019s press office and an attorney for the hotel owners asserted to THE CITY that Greco paid for her hotel stay but did not provide evidence.\nThe city Department of Investigation opened a probe in November 2023 after THE CITY\u2019s reporting. In February 2024, the FBI raided Greco\u2019s Bronx home and a second house nearby she had purchased recently. She then went on medical leave for a few months and came back to City Hall with a new role, and an increased salary of close to $200,000.\nShe resigned from the mayor\u2019s office in October."

In the memo, Bove argued the mayor's case was distracting him from dealing with illegal immigration, violent crime and his reelection campaign.\nIn a 57-page indictment filed in September, federal prosecutors claim Adams quietly solicited and accepted illegal gifts and campaign donations from wealthy foreigners including accepting luxury airline tickets, meals, and hotel stays.\nThe request from the DOJ to Manhattan prosecutors comes after speculation President Donald Trump would seek to end the case against Adams, a Democrat, to whom he has grown sympathetic. The Republican president previously said he would consider pardoning Adams and called him a political prosecution victim.\nAdams, who has proclaimed his innocence, calling the charges against him baseless, thanked the Justice Department on Tuesday for \"its honesty\" and said the move ends \u201ca monthslong saga that put me, my family, and this city through an unnecessary ordeal.\u201d\nUSA TODAY has reached out to The Southern District of New York.\nHere's a timeline of the federal corruption allegations against the mayor including when he started connecting with Trump.\nTimeline of Mayor Eric Adams' political career and corruption allegations\n2006: Adams was elected as state senator and went on to serve four terms.\n2013: Adams was elected Brooklyn borough president.\n2016: Adams reportedly gets free upgrades to business class for two round-trip flights from New York to India via Turkey.\n2017: Adams reportedly receives business class tickets for three on round trip from New York to France, Turkey, and China; and a heavily discounted stay in Bentley Suite of St. Regis Istanbul.

      "text": "In March 2021, a 33-year-old tech worker from Flushing, Queens, joined Eric Adams\u2019 mayoral campaign as a volunteer, working regularly with an effusive and understatedly powerful member of Adams\u2019s inner circle named Winnie Greco.\nShortly after Adams got to City Hall, Greco, by then on the city payroll as the mayor\u2019s $100,000-a-year director of Asian affairs, promised the tech worker a job in the administration on the condition that he volunteer once more, he recently told THE CITY \u2014 this time on a kitchen renovation in her Bronx home.\nAfter two months of shuttling a pair of local contractors to the small, white-shingled house and doing tasks that included buying, unloading, and stacking supplies from Home Depot, he was hired in July 2022 as a $62,215-a-year program coordinator at the Mayor\u2019s Office of Immigrant Affairs.\nThen things soured, he said, when he refused some of Greco\u2019s requests to do renovation work on city time and he stopped responding to her directives to come to her office to help respond to her emails and translate English-language messages into Chinese.\nAfter 12 months on the job, he was fired.\nAt roughly the same time the tech worker was volunteering on Adams\u2019 campaign, a Chinese-American business executive became a supporter as well, making significant in-kind contributions to the effort. (Both people asked THE CITY to withhold their names. The executive out of fear of retribution and the tech worker so as not to hurt his current job search.)\nRequests from Greco, a prolific volunteer Adams fundraiser, for more support continued after the mayor\u2019s election, the executive said, and included an appeal for a $10,000 donation as the price of admission to a Chinese-focused government event with Adams at Gracie Mansion.\nThe executive was willing to support the new mayor, but told THE CITY that Greco asked that the check be made out to a nonprofit she founded a decade earlier to construct an ornamental Chinese-themed \u201cFriendship Archway\u201d in Brooklyn\u2019s Sunset Park in partnership with a Beijing borough government \u2014 a project Adams has championed relentlessly.\nThe executive told THE CITY that five other people confided that they too had been approached by Greco in a similar fashion.\nThe two accounts, made in detailed interviews over the past two months, raise questions about whether one of Adams\u2019s most trusted advisers and biggest fundraisers has potentially violated city ethics rules.\nThe allegations were shared with THE CITY in the weeks before the FBI raided the Brooklyn home of 25-year-old Brianna Suggs, Adams\u2019s chief campaign fundraiser, as part of a probe of whether his\u2019 2021 mayoral campaign engaged in illegal fundraising involving money from Turkey.\nAdams has defended Suggs, and said last week that his campaign\u2019s conduct was guided by his frequent morning reminders that, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to follow the law.\u201d\nAdams\u2019 campaign spokesperson Evan Thies said Greco, a volunteer, had no official role in the 2021 campaign, wasn\u2019t paid by the campaign and had no hiring authority in the administration.\nWhen asked about Greco\u2019s alleged behavior since joining the administration, mayoral spokesperson Charles Lutvak said, \u201cOur administration will always follow the law, and we always expect all our employees to adhere to the strictest ethical guidelines.\u201d\nSpeaking of Greco, Lutvak continued, \u201cThroughout the time Mayor Adams has known Winnie, she has been a faithful public servant and advocate for her community. He is not aware of any inappropriate behavior whatsoever, and she strongly denies any allegations of illegal behavior.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cThis matter is under review,\u201d but, in response to multiple queries, wouldn\u2019t say what is being reviewed and by which entity.\nGreco referred all questions from THE CITY to the mayor\u2019s office.\nLutvak characterized the tech worker as a junior staffer who was terminated for \u201cdocumented cause,\u201d but wouldn\u2019t provide specific details after multiple queries from THE CITY, which reviewed the worker\u2019s annual performance review from May this year and his weekly work-tracker updates.\n\u201cThis simply appears to be trumped up accusations by a disgruntled former employee who tried and failed to get his job back,\u201d Lutvak said.\nBoth the tech worker and the business executive supported their accounts with documentary evidence.\nThe campaign volunteer shared screenshots of his work on the Bronx house \u2014 including on weekdays after he started his government position \u2014 as well as a text message in which he told his boss he was helping Greco with her emails.\nThe business person shared a copy of a signed check whose date correlates with the purported Greco meeting.\nRichard Briffault, former chair of the New York City Conflicts of Interest Board, said he\u2019s not aware of any rule or decision that specifically deals with the situation described by the business executive, but pointed to a prohibition on improper use of a city position to fundraise for private charities.\n\u201cThis could violate City Charter section 2604.b.2 \u2014 \u2018No public servant shall engage in any business, transaction or private employment . . . which is in conflict with the proper discharge on his or her official duties,\u2019\u201d said Briffault, a law professor at Columbia University.\nHe said the allegations described by the tech worker appear more clear-cut.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s obvious is that it\u2019s clearly in violation of the city\u2019s ethics rules for a public servant to force a subordinate to do personal errands for them whether it\u2019s on work time or not on work time,\u201d he said.\nFrom Fundraiser to Family\nBefore Greco joined city government the day after Adams\u2019 Jan. 1, 2022, swearing-in, she was an \u201cHonorary Ambassador to the Brooklyn Borough President\u201d when Adams held the office from 2014 to 2021, per a spokesperson at the time.\nShe was also a prolific fundraiser, unpaid by either Borough Hall or Adams\u2019 campaigns, with the might to reportedly help raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for Adams\u2019 campaign in a single night.\nIn her eight-year volunteer role with the borough president, Greco pitched Chinese government officials, business people and others for meetings and public appearances with Adams. Some of the business people would later host fundraisers for Adams\u2019 mayoral campaign.\nFor years, Greco, who emigrated from Fujian province in China and whose Chinese name is Zheng Qirong, would also shepherd Adams and other New York elected officials and business people on trips to China \u2014 dating back to a 1998 excursion with two dozen state lawmakers that lasted 15 days, according to an online posting from a corporation founded by Greco.\nNow, ensconced in an administration that runs much like a family, Greco is part of its core.\nShe was one of only about a dozen associates onstage with Adams at his mayoral swearing-in ceremony at Times Square in the early hours of Jan. 1, 2022.\nEarlier this year, she traveled to a work-related gathering in San Francisco, along with Adams\u2019 son, Jordan Coleman, as reported by Documented.\nAnd while she has often operated behind the scenes, Greco\u2019s influence has become most visible at Gracie Mansion, where Chinese holiday events \u2014 like the one described by the business executive who told THE CITY of the $10,000 donation request \u2014 bring throngs of business and provincial association leaders, many of them campaign contributors seeking to gain access to Adams.\nAt a recent celebration of the Chinese Mid-Autumn Harvest Festival at the mayor\u2019s official residence, Adams\u2019 chief confidant and top political advisor at City Hall, Ingrid Lewis-Martin, called Greco her \u201cbaby sister.\u201d\nShe then introduced Greco\u2019s mother, who was visiting from Hong Kong, to the crowd \u2014 and to the mayor.\n\u201cI have the pleasure of introducing Winnie\u2019s mom to her son, her son who this sister right here, Winnie, worked in partnership with a number of you and me to help elevate to become the 110th mayor of the City of New York \u2014 our Eric Adams,\u201d she told the crowd.\nLewis-Martin then said to Adams, who was standing off stage, \u201cCome out here and meet your mom.\u201d\nMoney, Money, Money\nAs Adams positioned himself for a run for mayor in his second term at Borough Hall, the role of Chinese-American donors, with Greco\u2019s help as a volunteer fundraiser, began to emerge in a critical way. This was the moment, early in a campaign, when a mayoral hopeful seeks to establish his gravitas with a display of fundraising might.\nAdams\u2019 first large fundraiser was held on April 18, 2018, at the Royal Queen Restaurant in Flushing\u2019s New World Mall, and was organized by Greco according to sources in the Chinese-American community.\nRecords obtained by THE CITY show the Adams campaign reported the Queens event bringing in $21,900 from 31 donors, mostly Chinese Americans. (City Campaign Finance Board records show an additional $40,000 received that day from largely Chinese-American donors, but the Adams\u2019 campaign didn\u2019t link the donations to the event.)\nWhen Adams experienced a major setback that June \u2014 committing a political blunder that turned some of his Chinese-American supporters against him \u2014 he tapped Greco to bail him out.\nHis woes began when he exuberantly backed then-Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s call for the state legislature to abolish the entrance exam for the city\u2019s specialized high schools, in which Chinese students have excelled, but which has yielded a disproportionately small share of Black and Latino students.\nAgainst a backlash of fundraiser cancellations by Chinese-American groups, Greco quickly assembled a meeting at Park Asia restaurant in Sunset Park, where Adams tried to make amends to an angry audience.\nWith Greco seated nearby, Adams sought to use the meeting to stake out a middle ground. But after the pushback continued, Adams reversed his position on the entrance exam just days later, telling Chinese news outlets it should remain in place.\n\u201cMy goal is not to disappoint friends,\u201d he told one outlet.\nSuddenly the fundraisers were back on \u2014 and so was the financial muscle-flexing, with two 2019 events organized by Greco generating over $45,000, plus nearly $200,000 in potential matching funds, according to campaign finance records.\nOne of those fundraisers, held Oct. 10, brought in $32,400 from dozens of $250 contributions \u2014 the maximum amount eligible for the Campaign Finance Board\u2019s $8-to-$1 public matching funds program. Nine of the donations came through money orders, a relatively hard-to-trace form of payment.\nAs THE CITY previously reported, a college graduate said two of the money orders were forged in his and his father\u2019s names, with his father\u2019s occupation listed as \u201chousewife.\u201d\nIn 2021, after Adams\u2019 primary runoff victory, when donors were eager to give to a man who was poised to gain control of City Hall\u2019s levers for at least the next four years, Greco helped assemble a new group, multiple sources said, that hosted a string of fundraisers for the Adams campaign over the next six months \u2014 the Alliance of Asian American Friends.\nThat July 2, the Alliance hosted a \u201cThank you banquet\u201d for Adams, again at the Royal Queen Restaurant, with over 100 attendees.\nGreco, Alliance president Tian Ji Li and Adams sat down next to each other at the main table, a video of the event shows.\n\u201cBig applause for Winnie Greco, who for the past three years has been a liaison, she\u2019s been our ambassador, she\u2019s the one who talks to us, and she\u2019s the one who promotes Adams in our community,\u201d Li, who formerly employed Greco at one of his Chinatown stores, said to the crowd in Mandarin. \u201cThank you! You are the most important one.\u201d\nThe group\u2019s fundraising hit its apex at a party in Queens on Dec. 12, 2021, after Adams had already won the mayoralty.\nAccording to two major Chinese-language newspapers in the US, US China Press and Sing Tao Daily, and two sources in the Chinese-American community, guests said the event, attended by Greco, Li, Adams and his brother Bernard, raised over $400,000 for Adams\u2019 transition.\nAn Adams 2021 campaign official said the total received on that date was far less, but a review of Campaign Finance Board records shows a number of donors who attended the event \u2014 including Li \u2014 made $5,100 contributions in the days beforehand.\nWhile the Alliance operated, Greco worked for months from a campaign office inside the New World Mall, according to the mall\u2019s building manager, Shastri Etwaroo, and the tech worker who worked there with her.\nCampaign finance laws require that rent for such offices be recorded at fair market price as a campaign expenditure. But Adams campaign filings show no rent payments on the space and an Adams campaign official said the campaign has no records of the office.\nThe mall is owned by Lian Wu Shao, chairman of JMart supermarkets, who hosted a fundraiser for Adams at his home on Aug. 8, 2021, that was the subject of an investigation by THE CITY. The event brought in nearly $55,000 from over 200 donors \u2014 many of them low-wage JMart or mall workers, or people listed as unemployed who donated exactly $249 or $250 each, the maximum amount to qualify for the City\u2019s matching fund program.\nOne mall worker told THE CITY she was reimbursed for her donation of $249, while a JMart worker said she thought her contribution had gone to an infrastructure project rather than a mayoral campaign, and almost a dozen others claimed they donated at the behest of or with encouragement from mall managers raising questions about potential straw donations.\nShao didn\u2019t respond to multiple phone calls seeking comment.\nGreco also used an office on nearby Main Street, in a building owned by Li, from June to October, according to the former tech worker. Adams campaign filings show only a single $1,800 payment covering a portion of the June 2021 rent on that space, covering 22 days.\nAsked about the lease and the rent paid by the Adams campaign, Li said that a 22-day lease at the office would have cost around $20,000.\n\u201cThese numbers you\u2019re telling me, I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d he said.\nThe Adams campaign said the office was only used for a short while during the primary but didn\u2019t specify the time.\nThe Archway\nAfter years of forging ties between New York elected officials and China \u2014 most notably through the international trips and signing of \u201csister city\u201d agreements \u2014 Greco turned her attention to a singular project that would come to dominate her attention, and Adams\u2019, during their time at Borough Hall.\nShe pitched both Adams and his predecessor at Borough Hall, Marty Markowitz, on a plan that would see the Chaoyang District government in Beijing gift and ship an ornate 40-foot archway to the main drag of Brooklyn\u2019s Chinatown, spanning 8th Avenue near 61st Street.\nHer vision called for the Beijing district government to pay for the cost of constructing and shipping the main structure, while local nonprofits \u2014 including one that she founded in 2012 \u2014 would cover the cost of maintaining it.\nThe plan initially required no funding from the city government, records show.\nGreco\u2019s tenacious advocacy on the archway started almost immediately when Adams became borough president in 2014. It included raising funds from the Chinese-American community that she said would pay for the maintenance.\nShe used her nonprofit, the Sino-America NY Brooklyn Archway Association \u2014 for which she actively fundraised while volunteering at Brooklyn Borough Hall \u2014 to cover $7,000 in costs for her first trip with Adams to China in May 2014, according to an Adams spokesperson at the time.\nOn that trip, Adams signed sister city agreements with Yiwu and with Chaoyang, the Beijing borough set to gift the archway to Brooklyn, an internal Borough Hall memo shows.\nOn the same trip, a stop in the Gulou district of Fuzhou included a meeting with Lu Jianwang, president of the Manhattan-based American Changle Association. Earlier this year, the FBI arrested Lu and another Changle leader, with federal prosecutors alleging they were operating a spy station on behalf of the Chinese government that monitored Chinese-American immigrants.\nAccording to the Department of Justice, Jianwang and an associate conspired to act as agents of the Chinese government and also obstructed justice by destroying evidence, including communications with a Chinese official, when the FBI confronted them in 2022.\nLast year, the Director of National Intelligence issued a memo advising local U.S. officials to carefully scrutinize overtures from the Chinese government, including proposals to create \u201csister city\u201d partnerships with U.S. municipalities.\nBut many residents of the city\u2019s Chinese neighborhoods look at such relationships as expressions of ethnic pride rather than the ploys of an American global rival. One prominent elected official likened the agreements and China excursions as akin to the trips to Ireland or Israel sponsored by local Irish and Jewish groups.\nAfter that first trip to China with Greco, Adams pressed for the archway with City Hall at every turn, to the point that a former high-ranking official in de Blasio\u2019s administration characterized him as \u201cobsessed\u201d with it.\nIn 2017, de Blasio and Adams announced that the archway would soon be arriving pending a traffic study by the DOT. But in January 2020, City Hall said that the Chinese government had rescinded its offer of gifting the archway \u2014 seemingly derailing the project.\nGreco\u2019s archway group reported raising more than $221,000 between 2013 and 2018, according to available IRS filings, but said it spent most of that money on fundraising events along the way.\nThen Greco\u2019s nonprofit stopped filing its required IRS statements after 2018, although the fundraising for the archway continued, according to multiple Chinese-American community leaders.\nIn mid-2019, Greco circulated a poster on WeChat advertising a groundbreaking ceremony for the archway that had been planned for October of that year, with some seats going for $50,000 and a number for donations of $100,000, according to a screenshot viewed by THE CITY.\nThe fundraiser was ultimately canceled, and it\u2019s not clear whether any funds had been collected.\nIn May 2022, the IRS revoked the archway nonprofit\u2019s tax-exempt status over its failure to file financial statements in each of the prior three years, an IRS database shows.\nRobin Mui, publisher of the Sing Tao US newspapers, who is friends with Adams and Greco, told THE CITY that he\u2019s running the archway group since Greco can\u2019t while on the government payroll.\nMui said he recently spoke to Adams and got the green light to move forward with the archway.\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Let\u2019s get on it,\u2019\u201d Mui told THE CITY. \u201cI\u2019m going to mobilize the community and ask them to donate. I don\u2019t think that will be a problem.\u201d\nAt the same time, a budget snapshot for the city Department of Transportation shows completion of the archway isn\u2019t expected until April 2029 \u2014 which would be Adams\u2019 last year in office should he win a second term.\nMui was required by the U.S. State Department to register the newspaper as a foreign agent in 2021, but on the registration form, he argued that the U.S. segment of the Hong-Kong based publication is editorially independent.\nHe told THE CITY a change in ownership in Hong Kong sparked the registration requirement, with which he had no choice but to comply.\nMultiple sources told THE CITY that Chinese-American community members have been trying to figure out how much was raised for the archway organization and how the money was spent. They say the lack of any visible movement toward construction \u2014 particularly with its two biggest proponents now at City Hall \u2014 is a sore point.\nQueenie Ho, chair of a Brooklyn neighborhood advisory board, said she believed Greco\u2019s main engagement with the Chinese-American community was almost exclusively related to fundraising.\n\u201cShe is always asking for donations. If she is not raising funds, then we don\u2019t see her,\u201d said Ho.\n\u201cDifferent Chinese organizations participated in those fundraising events for Eric Adams. But even after he got elected as a New York City mayor, the archway on 8th Ave of Brooklyn was never installed,\u201d she added. \u201cWe Chinese communities feel manipulated, used, and dumped.\u201d\nIn the Halls of Power\nEven after joining city government, Greco has continued to appear at fundraisers for Adams \u2014 now for his 2025 re-election efforts.\nIn June, she attended one in Manhattan, along with Adams, where donations were made from a number of people whose LLC was subsequently awarded the management of the East Broadway Mall, according to the publication Documented.\nOn a recent Friday evening, Greco could be seen making the rounds at a Sunset Park restaurant event honoring a local nonprofit, giving a peck on the cheek to a local community leader, and embracing Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez in a long hug.\nAcross the street from the restaurant, her red Cadillac XT5 was parked with a placard in the window that read, \u201cTHIS VEHICLE IS ON OFFICIAL NYPD BUSINESS.\u201d\nA City Hall spokesperson said city agencies issue parking placards to staff who conduct official business, but he didn\u2019t address the placard\u2019s claim regarding police work.\nAfter assuming her administration position, Greco was joined at City Hall by her niece, Wai Ying Cheng, a recent college graduate, who was hired on the same day, and assigned to the mayor\u2019s office at a salary of $80,000.\nThis June, Cheng became a scheduler for the mayor, with a pay hike to $120,000 \u2014 $20,000 more than her aunt, the city\u2019s Director of Asian Affairs, receives, payroll records show. Lutvak, the mayoral spokesperson, called Cheng \u201can integral and high-performing member of the team.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t until May 2022, according to the tech worker who said he\u2019d done work on Greco\u2019s home, that Greco began to land him interviews with people at the Mayor\u2019s Office of Immigrant Affairs.\nHe was hired two months later, according to city personnel records. But even afterward, the worker said, Greco continued to ask him to clean her kitchen and take out the debris from her home renovations \u2014 this time while on the city clock.\nHe says he tried to complete most of the requests on weekends but declined a few times to go to her house when asked to go during work hours.\nHe also says he informed his supervisors, including deputy commissioner Miosotis Mu\u00f1oz and assistant commissioner Erick Salgado, every time he was called out of the office to Greco\u2019s desk located three floors up in the same building, where he helped her read and reply to emails she received.\n\u201cI felt obligated to help her. Two weeks after I began working at MOIA she said to me, \u2018Do you know how much effort I made to get you hired?\u2019\u201d he told THE CITY.\nIn March of this year, the former tech worker got a three-month warning from Mu\u00f1oz and Salgado. He was terminated on June 26.\nSalgado didn\u2019t respond to messages seeking comment and Mu\u00f1oz referred questions to the MOIA press office, which referred questions to City Hall.\nBut the tech worker said he recalls one of his weekly meetings with Salgado that took place in April, during which he asked Salgado what he could do to improve his performance.\nHe says the reply he got back from Salgado was: \u201cBe good to Winnie.\u201d"

He said European nations are the \"first line of defense\" but added \"we're going to help them out also. We'll be involved.\"\nUkraine has sought security guarantees as part of any peace deal to prevent Russia from attacking the country again, and that was a major focus of the Aug. 17 meeting. Trump indicated the U.S. is prepared to help with security, drawing praise from Zelenskyy and European leaders.\n\u201cWe will speak more about security guarantees,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cThis is very important that the United States gives such strong signal and is ready for security guarantees.\u201d\nZelenskyy said he needs U.S. assistance to help Ukraine\u2019s army, as well as weapons and intelligence as part of a peace deal with Russia. Pushed to weigh in, Trump pointed to Europe again, saying \"they want to give protection, they feel very strongly about it.\"\n\u201cAnd we'll help them out with that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important. I think it's very important to get the deal.\"\nSending U.S. troops would be a huge step, though, and a thorny political issue, including with Trump's MAGA base.\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt reiterated Trump's opposition to U.S. troop involvement in Ukraine peacekeeping.\n\u201cThe president has definitively stated U.S. boots will not be on the ground in Ukraine, but we can certainly help in the coordination and perhaps provide other means of security guarantees to our European allies,\" Leavitt said Aug. 19.\nDuring the Fox interview Trump also discussed his Aug. 18 conversation with Putin. He said he didn't call Putin in front of Zelenskyy and the European leaders.\n\u201cI thought that would be disrespectful to President Putin,\" Trump said. In describing his relationship with Putin, Trump said \"there's a warmth there.\"\nTrump is trying to setup a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy that would be followed by a three-way meeting that he would moderate. He suggested Putin and Zelenskyy are \"getting along a little bit better than I thought.\"\n\"Otherwise I wouldn't have setup the\" two-way meeting, he said.\nContributing: Francesca Chambers, Joey Garrison"

  "argos_summary": "The article exposes a scandal involving Winnie Greco, a former political aide turned NYC Director of Asian Affairs, who allegedly accepted a red envelope containing $10,000 in cash from a donor during a grocery trip, then tried to keep the money. Greco, who has been a key fundraiser for Mayor Eric Adams, faces accusations of using her nonprofit for personal gain, demanding donations for a never-built archway in Brooklyn\u2019s Chinatown, and exploiting her city position to solicit personal favors. She was suspended from her role and her niece was hired at a higher salary than her. The investigation, prompted by a reporter\u2019s tip, led to a federal probe, a federal search of her home, and a federal indictment for bribery. The article also details Greco\u2019s continued presence at fundraisers, her alleged misuse of city resources, and the broader context of her political influence and questionable fundraising practices. The piece underscores the potential corruption and abuse of power within NYC politics, highlighting the need for accountability and transparency. ",
