  "description": "Sportscar manufacturer Porsche will soon drop out of Germanys blue-chip DAX index following a dramatic share price slump.",
  "content": "The Porsche brand logo as lettering can be seen on the rear of a vehicle from the sports car manufacturer Porsche in Munich (Bavaria) on April 6, 2025.\n\nLuxury carmaker Porsche will soon drop out of Germany's blue-chip DAX index following a protracted share price slump, as U.S. tariffs take their toll on the European auto industry.\n\nIn a Wednesday statement, STOXX Ltd said that Porsche would exit the DAX on Sept. 22 as part of a regular reshuffle and be replaced by online listings company Scout24.\n\nPorsche is poised to become a member of the midcap MDAX index later this month, according to the update from a unit of stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse.\n\nThe manufacturer of high-performance sports cars, such as the renowned 911 model and luxury sports utility vehicles, has been hit particularly hard by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on European autos.\n\nPorsche, which entered the DAX three years ago after its initial public offering in Sept. 2022, has repeatedly lowered its outlook in recent months, citing the impact of U.S. tariffs, weak demand in China and a slower-than-expected transition to electric mobility.\n\nCompany shares have fallen by more than a third over the last 12 months.\n\nPorsche CEO Oliver Blume said in an interview with German newspaper FAZ on Thursday that the company aims to return to the DAX \"as soon as possible\" and cited technical factors for the firm's index relegation.\n\nA spokesperson for Porsche referred CNBC to Blume's comments to FAZ when asked to comment on the new orientation.",

      "text": "- Macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds weigh substantially on half-year results. Porsche responds with comprehensive strategic realignment measures.\n- Extensive rescaling and a more flexible product portfolio are its objectives.\n- Special charges of around 1.1 billion euros, including for battery activities, US tariffs and the strategic realignment.\n- Group sales revenue in the first half of the year at 18.16 billion euros, with operating profit at 1.01 billion euros.\n- Record deliveries in North America as well as in the Overseas and Emerging Markets.\n- The proportion of electrified vehicles in Europe is around 57 per cent, exceeding the target set at the time of the IPO.\n- Success in quality ranking and in motorsport.\n- CEO Oliver Blume: \u201cThe world is changing dramatically. That's why we are fundamentally developing Porsche. Our completely revamped product range is very well received by our customers. We therefore expect that we will begin to see positive momentum again from 2026 onwards.\u201d\n- CFO Dr Jochen Breckner: \u201cThe aim of our strategic realignment is to strengthen our profitability and resilience.\u201d\nIn the first six months of 2025, the sports car manufacturer generated a group sales revenue of 18.16 billion euros (previous year: 19.46 billion euros). Group operating profit amounted to 1.01 billion euros (previous year: 3.06 billion euros). The group operating return on sales was 5.5 per cent (previous year: 15.7 per cent).\nBusiness performance was impacted by ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges. \u201cWe continue to face significant challenges around the world. And this is not a storm that will pass. The world is changing dramatically \u2013 and, above all, differently to what was expected just a few years ago. Some of the strategic decisions made back then appear in a different light today. That is why we are fundamentally developing Porsche further,\u201d says Oliver Blume, Chairman of the Executive Board of Porsche AG. \u201cOur completely revamped product range is very well received by our customers. We expect that we will begin to see positive economic momentum again from 2026 onwards.\u201d\nAccording to Blume, three factors in particular are shaping the current situation for Porsche: \u201cIn China, demand in the premium and luxury segment has fallen sharply. In the US, import tariffs are also putting huge pressure on our business. Looking ahead, the movement of the dollar could also have an impact. In addition, the transformation to electric mobility is progressing more slowly than expected overall, with consequences for the supplier network.\u201d In light of these conditions, Porsche\u2019s management is resolutely pushing ahead with extensive measures to rescale and recalibrate the company. In the first half of 2025, special expenses for the company's realignment amounted to around 200 million euros, and to around 500 million euros for battery activities. The US import tariffs resulted in an additional burden of 400 million euros because Porsche offered its customers price protection.\nSecond package of measures to be negotiated with employee representatives\n\u201cThe aim of our strategic realignment is to strengthen our profitability and resilience,\u201d says Dr Jochen Breckner, Member of the Executive Board for Finance and IT. In the second half of this year, Porsche will start negotiations with employee representatives on a second package of measures, as announced. \u201cIn order to make Porsche fit for the future, we will discuss far-reaching approaches,\u201d says Breckner. \"These measures are expected to have a positive impact on earnings and cash flow in the coming years.\u201d\nAutomotive net cashflow amounted to 394 million euros (previous year: 1.12 billion euros). The automotive net cashflow margin was 2.4 per cent (previous year: 6.3 per cent). In the first half of this year, Porsche delivered 146,391 vehicles to its customers worldwide. Of these, 36.1 per cent were electrified. This percentage is made up of 23.5 per cent all-electric vehicles and 12.6 per cent plug-in hybrids. In Europe, the proportion of electrified vehicles was around 57 per cent. This exceeded the target set at the time of the IPO. The best-selling model was the Macan, with 45,137 deliveries worldwide. Porsche set new delivery records in North America as well as in the Overseas and Emerging Markets.\n\u201cWe will continue to manage supply and demand in close coordination with our sales regions in accordance with our 'value over volume' strategy. This is based on our highly attractive product range and the strength of our brand,\u201d says Breckner. \u201cWe are also seeing positive momentum from our individualisation offerings.\u201d\nPlanned ramp-up of battery cell production at V4Smart\nA few months after the founding of V4Smart GmbH, the Porsche AG subsidiary has reached its first milestone with the second production line in N\u00f6rdlingen (Bavaria) now ramped up as planned. Alongside the line in Ellwangen, it is currently the only production facility in Europe for high-performance lithium-ion round cells.\nPorsche has also performed well in terms of quality. In the recently published J.D. Power APEAL study in the US, Porsche ranked first among all manufacturers in customer perception. In motorsport, the sports car manufacturer achieved an impressive double victory last weekend. At the season finale of the Formula E in London, Porsche won the world championship title in both the team and manufacturer standings. Prior to that, Porsche celebrated its second consecutive class victory in the LMGT3 category at the 24 Hours of Le Mans with the Porsche 911 GT3 R. In the overall standings, the Porsche 963 finished second at Le Mans after a thrilling finale.\nForecast for 2025 adjusted after tariff agreement\nFollowing the EU Commission's agreement with the US government on import tariffs, Porsche has adjusted its outlook for 2025. This takes into account the expected effects of the new tariffs as well as the tariff effects that have been in place since June, which had not yet been included in the previous forecast. The updated forecast now includes expected import tariffs of 15 per cent from August 1, as well as potential countermeasures such as price adjustments. These are designed to mitigate the financial impact. Porsche continues to expect group sales revenue in the range of 37 to 38 billion euros. This is in line with the previous forecast. At the lower end of the range, Porsche expects a group return on sales of 5 per cent and an automotive net cashflow margin of 3 per cent. At the upper end of the range, a group return on sales of 7 per cent and an automotive net cashflow margin of 5 per cent are expected. The upper end remains in line with the original forecast from the end of April. The outlook includes expected special effects related to the strategic realignment, amounting to around 1.3 billion euros.\n| Porsche AG Group |\nH1 2025 |\nH1 2024 |\nAlteration |\n| Sales revenue |\n\u20ac18.16 billion |\n\u20ac19.46 billion |\n-6.7% |\n| Operating profit | \u20ac1.01 billion |\n\u20ac3.06 billion |\n-67.0% |\n|\nOperating return on sales |\n5.5% | 15.7% |\n|\n|\nDeliveries to customers |\n146,391 | 155,945 | -6.1% |\nDisclaimer\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements and information that reflect Dr. Ing. h.c.

      "text": "The U.S. and European Union on Thursday revealed fresh details about their trade framework, including on hotly contested and anticipated pharma and semiconductor tariffs.\nAfter weeks of heated negotiation, Brussels and Washington finally arrived at a trade agreement late last month, setting out 15% blanket tariffs on EU exports to the U.S. Under the deal, the EU also committed to purchase $750 billion worth of U.S. energy and invest at least an additional $600 billion in the U.S.\nMany political and business leaders in Europe at the time expressed concerns about the deal being unbalanced. Several questions remained unanswered including on what tariff rate would apply to some goods U.S. President Donald Trump has hit with sectoral duties.\nThursday's announcement at last shed more details at a time when many other trading partners are still waiting, and negotiating, for similar clarity on their respective trade deals with the U.S.\nSpeaking to journalists on Thursday after the announcement, EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic said that \"this is the most favorable trade deal the U.S. has extended to any partner.\"\n\"But this is not the end. This is the beginning. This framework is the first step, one that can grow over time to cover more sectors, improve market access and strengthen our economic ties even further,\" he added.\nLumber, tech and regulation\nKey points in the statement include the U.S. committing to \"apply the higher of either the U.S. Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff rate or a tariff rate of 15 percent, comprised of the MFN tariff and a reciprocal tariff, on originating goods of the European Union.\"\nAs of Sept. 1, the U.S. will apply only MFN duties on several goods from the EU, including \"unavailable natural resources (including cork), all aircraft and aircraft parts, generic pharmaceuticals and their ingredients and chemical precursors.\"\nSeveral so-called Section 232 tariffs have been capped at the wider 15% tariff rate, including those on lumber, semiconductors and pharmaceuticals, according to a senior U.S. administration official. This is sharply below the rates Trump has sometimes threatened, as well as a 100% levy on semiconductors.\nMeanwhile, the statement noted that the EU intends to \"to eliminate tariffs on all U.S. industrial goods and to provide preferential market access for a wide range of U.S. seafood and agricultural goods.\" This was already broadly covered in the initial framework.\nThe statement also included insights into the EU's energy purchasing and investment pledges, which previously raised questions about their feasibility and about potential repercussions if the commitments do not materialize.\nThe latest announcement reiterated figures for planned spending from the EU, including on artificial intelligence chips, energy and broader investments in the U.S., but described them as intended and expected, rather than as guaranteed commitments, a senior administration official pointed out.\nThursday's statement also noted plans for the EU to \"substantially\" increase its procurement of U.S. military and defense equipment, even as Europe has committed to growing its own defense capabilities.\nNotably, the latest agreement does not introduce changes in terms of the EU's Digital Services Act, which includes regulations for big tech companies and has long been a point of contention in trade talks for Trump.\nSefcovic on Thursday noted that the digital sector had been kept out of trade talks.\nHe also addressed questions regarding the wine and spirits sector, which is not covered by the deal. The EU's trade commissioner suggested that, while it would not be easy to come to an agreement on this issue with Washington, \"these doors are not closed forever.\"\nPharma\nEurope's pharmaceutical sector \u2014 the U.S.' top source for pharma imports \u2014 will also see tariffs capped at up to 15%. Critically, the rate will not stack on top of other EU-wide tariffs.\nFrom Sept. 1, the Trump administration has also agreed to only apply its MFN drug pricing policy to generic pharmaceuticals. The directive aims to reduce U.S. drug prices by tying them to the typically lower prices paid by other developed nations.\nBack in April, the Trump administration had launched a so-called Section 232 investigation on pharmaceutical products to examine the impact of imports on national security. In recent weeks, Trump threatened levies as high as 250% on the pharma sector and sent an ultimatum to major firms demanding that they lower U.S. drug prices.\nThe White House leader has long lambasted the sector over what he has dubbed \"abusive\" pricing practices, while simultaneously urging firms to move their manufacturing operations stateside in an effort to bolster domestic production.\nThat prompted a flurry of U.S. investment commitments over recent months, including from Novartis, AstraZeneca and Roche, as well as pricing adjustments from Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly.\nAutos\nThe U.S. and EU on Thursday said they had agreed to a conditional 15% tariff for European autos and auto parts bound for the U.S. \u2014 but only after Brussels introduces legislation to reduce their industrial duties, according to a senior administration official.\nThe official added that the mere introduction of EU legislation to reduce the rate of industrial tariffs would be enough to kick-start this trade-off.\n\"With respect to automobiles, the United States and the European Union intend to accept and provide mutual recognition to each other's standards,\" the U.S. and EU said in a joint statement published Thursday.\nUnder the terms of the trade framework struck in late July, the EU said it would eliminate the \"already low\" duties on industrial goods from the U.S.\nSpeaking late last month, Trump had hailed the initially disclosed framework agreement as the biggest trade deal ever made and one that promised to be \"great for cars.\"\nThe prospect of a 15% tariff rate on autos and auto parts represents a substantial reduction from the U.S. president's threat to impose charges of 30%. It also nearly halves the existing tariff rate on Europe's auto sector from 27.5%.\nIndustry groups had previously expressed deep concern about the costs associated with the tariff reality.\nThe German Association of the Automotive Industry, or VDA, which represents more than 620 companies involved in the German auto sector, warned a U.S. tariff of 15% on auto products would \"cost German automotive companies billions annually and place a burden on them in the midst of their transformation.\""

The company will move into the mid\u2011cap MDAX and aims to re\u2011enter the DAX as soon as possible. The exit reflects the broader impact of U.S. trade policy on European automakers and signals a shift in the composition of Germany\u2019s blue\u2011chip benchmark.",
