  "description": "Ransomware criminals struck more than 450 confirmed victims",
  "content": "\u2022 Since 2022, the group hit 450 companies and stole millions of dollars\n\nBlackSuit, a ransomware group and a successor to the Royal gang, managed to compromise 450 organizations in the United States and steal $370 million in ransom payments, before being dismantled by US law enforcement agents, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has said.\n\nA press release published on the US Immigration and Customs Enforcements (ICE) website, said ICE\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations (its main investigative arm), in coordination with both US and international law enforcement agents, \u201csuccessfully dismantled critical infrastructure used by BlackSuit ransomware\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe operation resulted in the seizures of servers, domains and digital assets used to deploy ransomware, extort victims, and launder proceeds,\u201d it was said.\n\nThe announcement said that since 2022, Royal and BlackSuit ransomware groups have compromised more than 450 known victims in the United States, including healthcare, education, public safety, energy, and government sector organizations.\n\nThese attacks brought them more than $370 in cryptocurrency, based on today\u2019s prices.\n\nUnfortunately, no one was arrested, and if history taught us anything - these threat actors will be back sooner rather than later.\n\nWhile disrupting the infrastructure is a commendable move and will certainly make things difficult for the threat actors in the short-term, they will have no issues reestablishing the hardware, especially with $370 million in their pocket.\n\nPreviously, the FBI, US Homeland Security, the US Department of Justice (DoJ), and other partners, defaced BlackSuit\u2019s main website, as well as extortion and data leak sites, in a sting called \u201cOperation Checkmate\u201d.\n\nA US Department of Health and Human Services report published in late November 2023 said BlackSuit was first spotted in May that year, showing \u201cstriking parallels with Royal, the direct successor of the former notorious Russian-linked Conti operation\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis operation strikes a critical blow to BlackSuit\u2019s infrastructure and operations,\u201d said US Secret Service Criminal Investigative Division Special Agent in Charge William Mancino.\n\n\u201cThe US Secret Service is committed to working alongside our law enforcement partners to dismantle criminal enterprises and prevent the deployment of malicious ransomware that victimizes businesses and organizations.\u201d\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 Top ransomware group BlackSuit has dark web extortion sites seized and shut down\n\u2022 Take a look at our guide to the best authenticator app\n\u2022 We've rounded up the best password managers",

The group was dismantled by US law enforcement agents, including ICE\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations (ICE), which seized servers, domains, and digital assets used to deploy ransomware, extort victims, and launder proceeds.

      "text": "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says the cybercrime gang behind the Royal and BlackSuit ransomware operations had breached hundreds of U.S. companies before being taken down last month.\nHomeland Security Investigations (HSI), DHS's main investigative arm, which took down the group's infrastructure in cooperation with international law enforcement partners, added that the cybercriminals also collected over $370 million from their victims.\n\"Since 2022, the Royal and BlackSuit ransomware groups have compromised over 450 known victims in the United States, including entities in the healthcare, education, public safety, energy and government sectors,\" the HSI said in a Thursday press release.\n\"Combined, the groups have received more than $370 million in ransom payments, based on present-day valuations of cryptocurrency. The ransomware schemes used double-extortion tactics \u2014 encrypting victims' systems while threatening to leak stolen data to further coerce payment.\"\nThe U.S. Department of Justice confirmed on July 24 that law enforcement seized BlackSuit's dark web extortion domains, replacing the contents of the gang's leak sites with seizure banners as part of a joint international action codenamed Operation Checkmate.\nThe cybercrime group behind these two ransomware operations surfaced as Quantum ransomware in January 2022 and was believed to be a successor to the notorious Conti cybercrime syndicate. While they initially deployed encryptors from other groups (like ALPHV/BlackCat), they later developed their own Zeon encryptor, rebranding as Royal ransomware in September 2022.\nIn June 2023, after targeting the City of Dallas, Texas, and testing a new encryptor called BlackSuit, the Royal ransomware gang switched to the BlackSuit brand.\nCISA and the FBI confirmed in a November 2023 joint advisory that Royal and BlackSuit shared similar tactics, linking the Royal ransomware gang to attacks targeting over 350 organizations worldwide since September 2022, which resulted in ransom demands exceeding $275 million.\nAn August 2024 joint advisory from the two agencies later confirmed that the Royal ransomware had rebranded as BlackSuit and demanded over $500 million from victims since its emergence more than two years before.\nChaos ransomware rebrand\nSince BlackSuit's infrastructure was dismantled, the Cisco Talos threat intelligence research group has found evidence suggesting the BlackSuit ransomware gang will now likely rebrand itself again as Chaos ransomware.\nThe cybercriminals' new ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation has already been linked to double extortion attacks, where they use voice-based social engineering for access and deploy an encryptor that targets both local and remote storage for maximum damage.\n\"Talos believes the new Chaos ransomware is unrelated to previous Chaos builder-generated variants, as the group uses the same name to create confusion,\" the researchers said.\n\"Talos assesses with moderate confidence that the new Chaos ransomware group is either a rebranding of the BlackSuit (Royal) ransomware or operated by some of its former members.\n\"This assessment is based on the similarities in TTPs, including encryption commands, the theme and structure of the ransom note, and the use of LOLbins and RMM tools in their attacks.\"\nRed Report 2025: Analyzing the Top ATT&CK Techniques Used by 93% of Malware\nMalware targeting password stores surged 3X as attackers executed stealthy Perfect Heist scenarios, infiltrating and exploiting critical systems.\nDiscover the top 10 MITRE ATT&CK techniques behind 93% of attacks and how to defend against them.\nPost a Comment Community Rules\nYou need to login in order to post a comment\nNot a member yet?

      "text": "Best password manager of 2025: reviewed, rated, and ranked by the experts\nLooking to keep all your passwords in one super secure location? This is the guide for you\nPassword managers are used to store, automatically fill, and generate secure and unique passwords to help keep all your online accounts from being broken in to.\nMy team of experts have been testing the best password managers for over 11 years, and in that time have racked up over 5000 hours in testing. I also frequently write about new updates and product changes made to password managers.\nNordPass remains the best password manager for the vast majority of people, offering a very easy to use app that is highly secure. Dashlane and Roboform also offer great password manager apps.\nI also have guides to the best free password managers, the best password managers for families, and the best business password manager - but before you check out those guides, here are my top recommendations for the best password manager overall:\nReader Offer: Save 52% on NordPass Premium\nNordPass provides an accessible, competent, easy-to-use solution that most people will love, according to TechRadar editors. Save 52% on NordPass Premium plus 1 month extra with code TECHRADARPASS.\nPreferred partner (What does this mean?)\nBenedict has spent over 7 years writing about security issues, covering everything from major data breaches and cyber attacks, to the malware and credentials thefts that threaten livelihoods and personal security. He has a passion for security products that keep people safe, and the knowledge to help them make the right decision.\nBest Password Manager Quick List\nBest overall\nBest password manager overall\nThis feature-packed password manager has just about everything you could hope for, and is great for all users - individual, business, enterprise. The free tier is lacking somewhat, but the prices for the premium plans represent good value considering what you get.\nBest for security\nBest password manager for security\nAnother popular and well-loved password manager, Dashlane is keen to pitch its strong security credentials as a leading feature. While all the managers here have a good reputation in this regard, Dashlane also prides itself on its easy to use interface, so it isn't a chore to navigate.\nBest for mobile\nBest password manager for mobile\nRoboForm works great on mobile (both Android and iPhone), and the free version includes cloud syncing, which is a nice bone to be thrown. Multi-device syncing is for paid users only, though, but prices are good.\nLoad the next 8 products \u2193\nBest for mid-size\nBest password manager for mid-sized business\nA great choice for medium-sized businesses, Keeper has some features that admins would love, including a policy engine and organizational structures. Prices can escalate quickly with add-ons though.\nBest for free\nBest free password manager\nBitwarden\u2019s free tier alone should cater to most users\u2019 needs. Unless you\u2019re a serious power user who requires some very advanced features, it is more than capable of storing all your passwords securely across all your devices - all without paying a penny.\nBest for enterprise\nBest password manager for enterprise\nThere\u2019s no out-of-the-box plan with N-able Passportal - this manager is a bona-fide enterprise offering, tailored to your needs based on consultation. Despite its advanced features, we found its user interface intuitive.\nBest for familes\nBest password manager for families\n1Password works well for families and businesses, with its sharing functionalities and some great security features that protect users from phishing and keylogging attacks.\nBest for privacy\nBest password manager for privacy\nBest known for its secure email service and VPN, Proton has now thrown its hat into the password management ring, and acquitted itself very well thus far. Its lack of pedigree in this area may deter some users, though.\nBest passwordless\nBest passwordless password manager\nOne of the notable features of this manager is the option to log in without a master password - you can use your fingerprint, a QR code or even a selfie instead. The overall package from LogMeOnce isn\u2019t bad either, making it a strong contender.\nBest for small business\nBest password manager for small business\nAs the name suggests, this is a solid password manager, but the price is high for what you get, and the lack of admin features makes this suitable only for small businesses. Individuals may look elsewhere.\nBest for Apple users\nBest password manager for Apple users\nA boon for Apple users, this password manager can integrate with iCloud and even has an app for Apple watch. Its sleek interface is right at home on the Cupertino giant\u2019s pristine devices too.\nThe best password managers of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest password manager overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want great performance: When we tested this manager, we found the performance and interface to be top in the class, making for a seamless and hassle-free experience throughout.\n\u2705 You want it on every platform: With apps for Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android, as well as browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, Brave, and Safari, NordPass can be used on just about anything you have.\n\u274c You won\u2019t use it much: NordPass might be overkill if you're a casual single user, as you might not make full use of its many additional features.\n\ud83d\udd12 NordPass is a great password manager option for many individuals, families, and organizations, thanks to its array of advanced features and professional interface. It might be a bit too much for the needs of some, though. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nThe vendors of one of the best VPN services around, NordVPN, have now made a password manager, and it\u2019s of a similarly impeccable standard.\nUnlike some, NordPass offers a free tier which provides storage for an unlimited number of passwords able to be accessed anywhere. The one downside being that only one active session can be used at a time, meaning that if you are logged in on more than one device, you will have to sign one out.\nThe premium plan offers the same as the free tier, with password strength detection, credential leak monitoring, and trusted password sharing to sweeten the deal at $1.89 per month.\nThe family plan allows six users to access all of the features offered on the free and premium plan, with the two year commitment coming in at just $2.79 per month for the whole family.\nThere is 24/7 email support and an online help center too, which helps to sweeten the deal further. All things considered, we believe NordPass to be a very capable password manager that offers plenty of value for money. There are even NordPass promo codes to bring the cost down more.\nRead our full NordPass review.\nBest password manager for security\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want to prioritize security: With features like real-time phishing alerts, Dashlane is great for those who want to keep constant vigilance on their security posture.\n\u2705 You want to go with the crowd: Dashlane is one of the most popular password managers for business, and its reputation should be of reassurance.\n\u274c You're on a budget: With all its premium features, Dashlane doesn't exactly come cheap, and its miserly free version only lets you use a single device.\n\ud83d\udd12 Dashlane is very close to its main rival NordPass, but it puts a bit more emphasis on security features. Its premium plans can be expensive, but it is one of the go-to choices for millions of users for a reason. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nDashlane has established itself as one of the most prominent password managers for businesses and individuals alike, and it wasn't hard for us to see why.\nWith the ability to store an unlimited amount of passwords and protect them with multi-factor authentication, we couldn't find any reason to doubt this password manager on the basis of its convenience and security offerings.\nSet up was easy, taking us no more than five minutes to get going. There were only a handful of steps, and the interface was laid out well, making it simple to navigate.\nOn top of this, there is also the option to store files in the manager - although the best cloud storage providers may be a better option if you require lots of safe and easily accessible storage. Dashlane premium also comes with a VPN, and although we found it perfectly serviceable, again you may want to consider using the best business VPN available if this is a top priority for your firm.\nThe only real downsides we found with this manager were the limited live chat hours and the cost of the lowest paid-for plan, which is one of the most expensive out there. And we think it's needed to get the most out of it, since the free tier is limited to only one device.\nBut we believe the price is justified considering the top-draw features on offer. There are also plenty of Dashlane promo codes to keep costs down too.\nRead our full Dashlane review.\nBest password manager for mobile\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want easy autofill: RoboForm has some great autofill capabilities, making it easy to complete login forms.\n\u2705 You want good value: RoboForm is very reasonably priced, but still has the top-end features you would expect of a premium manager.\n\u274c You want free device syncing: Syncing your passwords between devices is one of the most basic functionalities all good password managers should have, but the free version of RoboForm omits this.\n\ud83d\udd12 RoboForm is a well-priced password manager that has great autofill functionality. Device syncing isn't available on the free version. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nRoboForm is another competent password manager in our view, with extensions for major browsers and apps for iPhone and Android devices.\nThe setup was fairly straightforward, although we found the mobile apps did require us to create a few more authentication methods, such as PIN codes and biometrics, in addition to the standard master password.\nWe were impressed with the free version, which has a lot of features considering, such as the ability to store your vault in the cloud - which is usually reserved for paying password manager customers - or on your device only. We found that it can also check up on weak and reused passwords and has a password generator to fix them.\nWhat you don\u2019t get, however, is the ability to sync your passwords across multiple devices - you\u2019ll have to pay for that privilege, although we found the price of its premium tiers to be reasonable. These plans also offer secure password sharing, multi-factor authentication and round-the-clock support, which we are always pleased to see.\nRead our full Roboform review.\nBest password manager for mid-sized business\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want plenty of features: Keeper has a lot of features to get your hands on, making it a great choice for medium-sized teams.\n\u274c You want everything included: With Keeper, you have to purchase add-ons separately to get all those great aforementioned features - and the prices mount up.\n\u274c You want a free option: True to its premium stylings, there is no free version of Keeper, only a free trial for 30 days.\n\ud83d\udd12 Keeper is a great pick for businesses and has plenty of features available. However, you do have to pay extra for those add-ons, and there isn't a free tier. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nUnlike our previous entrants, there is no free version of Keeper, although there is a free 30-day trial should you wish to try it out with no commitment. But we found that the real selling point of this password manager is its feature set aimed at small to medium-sized businesses.\nThese include security auditing and flexible controls for organizations thanks to the Admin Console, which allows you to perform all sorts of management tasks. There are also additional modules you can purchase to extend Keeper to your firm\u2019s needs.\nHowever, some of these require further payment to add on and they can be quite expensive for what they are.\nThere is also a family plan, that let us share files between members securely as well as message each other with encryption, providing us with a handy alternative to popular messenger apps such as WhatsApp.\nIn our testing, Keeper was simple to set up desktop and mobile devices. Businesses will also be pleased to know that there are various ways of getting multiple users over to the manager, such as via domain name auto-provisioning, SSO and API/SDK.\nRead our full Keeper Security review.\nBest free password manager\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You don\u2019t want to pay anything: There isn\u2019t another password manager on the market that gives away so much without demanding any of your money.\n\u2705 You want open source software: Being open source means it can\u2019t really get away with hiding any major flaws or inconvenient truths.\n\u274c You value a slick interface above all else: Although its UI is perfectly usable, there are occasions where it isn't as seamless as we'd like.\n\ud83d\udd12 Bitwarden is absolutely stellar when it comes to value, giving away a very competent password manager with features that its rivals usually closet behind a paywall. Some minor UI issues are the only real drawbacks. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nThe first open source password manager to make an appearance on our list, Bitwarden offered us plenty of features, making it ideal for individuals and businesses alike, even for those who opt for its free tier. We had multi-device synchronization, optional self-hosting and unlimited password storage - all without paying a penny.\nBeing open source means that others can contribute to the app's development and view the process, giving users peace of mind that there'll be no way for the company to cover up any flaws.\n2FA is also available with the free tier, via email or an authenticator app. The premium tier, however, offers more 2FA options, such as physical security keys and integration with Duo Security, a specialist third party who can provide authentication via its mobile app, SMS message or phone call.\nPremium plans impressed us with their weak password and unsecured website detection, as well as business-focused features such as password sharing, fine-grained access control and user groups.\nDespite being open source, download and setup is still a breeze. The interface is clear enough (if a little basic) and there is even a command line option if you really want to get into it.\nThe desktop app is pretty basic, but Bitwarden is compatible with a whole host of browsers and platforms, including more obscure ones such as F-droid. In the end, it certainly gives its paid-for rivals a run for their money.\nRead our full Bitwarden review.\nBest password manager for enterprise\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're an enterprise: N-Able Passportal is made for large organizations, and offers tailored packages to suit your specific needs.\n\u2705 You want control: Being enterprise focused, Passportal also provides plenty of admin controls to manage employee use and security protocols.\n\u274c You want an off-the-shelf product: There are no pre-packaged plans for Passportal or even prices listed on its website - you have to contact support for a quote based on your requirements.\n\ud83d\udd12 N-able Passportal is a seriously capable password manager built for enterprise use. It offers plenty of control and admin tools, but it does require consultation to get going. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nWhen it comes to the best business password managers, look no further than the manager formerly known as Solarwinds Passportal. With some seriously advanced features, administration control for large teams and high-level security possibilities, it\u2019s one of the most powerful managers we've ever tested.\nIn addition, we also found it offered great customer support and had an easy to use interface. The rest of the company\u2019s ecosystem was also at our disposal should we have needed it.\nThe main issue we have with N-Able Passportal is that you have to get a quote from their sales team if you are interested in purchasing it (there is no free option) as there is no off-the-shelf product to choose from or even a price guide to view on their website.\nBut if you need to lock your business down tight, no matter its size, in a reliable and intuitive way, then Passportal should at least make it into your shortlist of password managers.\nRead our full N-Able Passportal review.\nBest password manager for families\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're a family: 1Password is great for family use, thanks to its sharing features.\n\u2705 You want good security: 1Password has a lot of useful security features, such as keylogging and phishing protection.\n\u274c You want a free password manager: 1Password is another manager that doesn't have any free options available.\n\ud83d\udd12 1Password is another popular choice among the third-party password managers, with a good track record and useful features for families and the security conscious. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nAnother very popular choice for a lot of people, 1Password has a great service for families with its shared password functionality.\nThere are two consumer plans offered, one for personal use and another for families with up to five members. There are also business and enterprise plans.\nSetup was once again easy for us, and even gave us the option to create what it calls an Emergency Kit - which you\u2019ll need if you ever have to recover your account if you forget your master password, for instance.\nWe like the fact that protection is provided against breaches, keylogging hacks and phishing attacks, and that we could only use 1Password in verified browsers. In fact, in our discussion with veteran security expert Roger Grimes, he singled out 1Password as the exemplar for highly secure password managers.\nWhile there is no free option, we think 1Password is a great choice for many, especially families.\nIt's worth seeing what 1Password promo codes are currently available for ways to save on your purchase.\nRead our full 1Password review.\nBest password manager for privacy\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 Privacy is a priority for you: Proton's track record in the online privacy market is second to none, and this focus has carried over into its new password manager as well.\n\u2705 You don't want to pay anything: Like Bitwarden, Proton Pass has a very well-rounded free version, although Bitwarden has the edge in terms of features and pedigree.\n\u274c You want support on every platform: Proton Pass is currently lacking desktop apps for macOS and Linux, and Safari is missing an extension too.\n\ud83d\udd12 Proton Pass is a very competent password manager, with some great features, including email aliasing and a 2FA authenticator. Although it is relatively new to the field, the company's ethos and reputation are reasons to be positive about this one. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nProton is perhaps best known for its secure mail and VPN services, but it has recently entered the password manager game, bringing along its trademark emphasis on privacy.\nThe interface of Proton Pass was something we found very appealing, staying true to its purple palette. It's neat and tidy, and was easy for us to navigate our way around.\nThere are extensions for Chrome, Edge and Firefox, as well as the privacy browser Brave, which is no surprise given the company's philosophy. But Safari misses out, as do desktop versions for macOS and Linux, although these are coming soon.\nWhile the free plan permits an unlimited number of devices, there are still various features that only paying customers on the Proton Pass Plus plan get. These include an integrated 2FA solution and vault sharing with up to 10 people. Proton Sentinel, which is specifically designed to prevent hackers taking over your account, is also for Plus members only.\nIf you want the ultimate package, though, then there is Proton Unlimited for \u20ac9.99 per month, which gives you access to the company's entire suite of products, including its email service, VPN and cloud storage solution.\nA very handy feature in Proton Pass is email aliasing - similar to what NordPass has. This means that when you sign up to services, you can keep your real address hidden to protect you from spam and potential scams. The free version allows users to create up to 10 aliases, whereas those on Proton Plus get an unlimited amount.\nDespite Proton's reputation in the privacy field, some users may be put off by the fact that Proton Pass isn't even a year old yet, so this is uncharted territory for the Swiss firm. However, given how well its other products perform, there's little reason to doubt its ability to produce a high-quality, secure password manager.\nAlthough it's still relatively new, we feel that Proton Pass has earned its place in our guide, as it continues to show signs of expansion and improvement.\nRead our full Proton Pass review.\nBest password manager for small business\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're a small business: With its good password sharing features, we think KeepSolid Passwarden would make a great choice for small teams.\n\u274c You're not willing to spend: KeepSolid Passwarden is relatively expensive compared to the competition, so be warned.\n\u274c You're larger than a small team: With a lack of admin features, centralized management and SSO, KeepSolid Passwarden wouldn't really be suitable for large businesses or enterprises.\n\ud83d\udd12 KeepSolid Passwarden offers all the features you could want from a password manager if you're an individual or small team, but if you're anything bigger, then this probably isn't for you. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nWe found KeepSolid Passwarden to be a capable password manager that can be used by everyone, from single users to families and businesses.\nSetup was the usual affair, taking us just minutes to download and create an account. We also received a recovery key in the event we get locked out for losing our master password. The import wizard was also impressive, letting us move passwords from other popular managers, such as LastPass, Dashlane, and 1Password, or a CSV file.\nThe manager can sync across multiple devices, has two-factor authentication and can be used in small teams to allow for password sharing from a single vault. The primary problem we had with Passwarden is its expense, which might not be worth it for personal users who won't need all the features it has to offer, such as password sharing.\nWe also thought the lack of administrative features, such as centralized password management and single sign-on, was disappointing, making for a password manager that works well in small team environments, but not really suitable for use within larger organizations. For those, N-able Passportal or Keeper are better options.\nIf you are using a password manager as part of a small business, though, we think this could be a great option.\nRead our full KeepSolid Passwarden review.\nBest for Apple users\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're an Apple person: mSecure offers iCloud syncing, and even has an Apple Watch app, making it a great choice for Apple fans.\n\u274c You want to a free option: mSecure is yet another service that has no free option available.\n\ud83d\udd12 mSecure would be a great password manager for Apple users, given its iCloud support and Apple Watch app. It also makes regular improvements to its service, based on what we've seen so far. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nmSecure comes with unlimited password storage and several different categories to save more than just passwords. There are also custom fields, useful when certain accounts require more than a password, such as an additional secret word, security question or PIN. In addition, you can also create groups for your passwords to better organize them.\nSetting up mSecure was quick and easy for us during our testing. Support for third-party devices and software was also something we welcomed. For instance, mSecure can sync with popular cloud storage providers Dropbox and Apple's own iCloud, and naturally has an app for Apple Watch too.\nThere are a few minor gripes we have with mSecure, though, including a lack of user support and no free option, but overall mSecure still remains affordable and capable enough for the majority of people.\nRead our full mSecure review.\nBest passwordless password manager\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You don't want a master password: LogMeOnce lets you do away with a master password and instead just use your fingerprint, PIN, a QR code, or even a selfie.\n\u274c You want it on alternative browsers: Browser extensions are only available for Chrome, Safari and Edge, so Firefox and other users may want to look elsewhere.\n\ud83d\udd12 LogMeOnce is a competent password manager that offers convenience in the form of passwordless access to your vault. Its lack of support for browsers outside the mainstream is the only real negative. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nAs well as offering features such as cross-platform and unlimited device support, even with its free tier, what set this password manager apart for us was the lack of a master password requirement. Instead, we could log in using facial recognition via Apple\u2019s Face ID or even a selfie, as well as our fingerprint or PIN number.\nWhat\u2019s more, we could choose to lock away certain passwords with one of these different methods, thus applying different levels of security and convenience to each of our credentials.\nAdditional security features include the ability to encrypt and store passwords online to make accessibility easier. Single Sign-On (SSO) is also available as with other password managers, which allows secure authentication for third-party applications.\nWe mark this manager down, though, for only having extensions for four browsers - namely Chrome, Safari, Edge and Internet Explorer (although the latter is no longer supported by Microsoft and we do not recommend you continue using it).\nIf you want greater browser extension support, then Bitwarden is an ideal choice, as it is compatible with many mainstream and alternative, privacy-focused browsers.\nRead our full LogMeOnce review.\nD\u00e9sir\u00e9 has been musing and writing about technology during a career spanning four decades.

But the advantages of using one are quite clear.\nRather than being tied to the first-party managers offered by the likes of Apple and Google, using a standalone password manager means that you can access your credentials no matter what platform or device you are on.\nThey also give you the ability to organize your passwords how you like, by letting you create folders and grant different levels of access to certain items in your vault. Some come with additional tools, like a VPN in some cases, too.\nHow does a password manager work?\nA Password manager is a very simple and easy to use utility that requires minimal user interaction, since most of its actions are automated. They will work across numerous platforms, and they should feature a browser extension for use on desktop computers, as well as an app for smart devices such as your mobile phone. The passwords you use on each platform will synchronize across all the devices you use the password manager with.\nOnce you set up your password manager, you can go ahead and create whatever digital accounts you want. They will usually throw up a prompt to create a strong password for you when doing so - this is the password generation feature of the manager. Once you accept, it will then store the password and username for you in its vault, so when you next go to log in, you should find your credentials already filled out for you.\nIf you ever want to change or update your password for an existing account, you can do this too. Again, a prompt will usually appear from the password manager, confirming whether you want to overwrite the existing password with the new one you have created, ensuring your password manager remains up to date. Some password managers even have a version history, so you can see the previous passwords you have used.\nAs for importing your existing passwords stored on another manager, this should be a fairly straightforward process. Many managers will give you the option to import and export your passwords as a csv file, or any one that can be opened with spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets. This allows you to export them out from your old manager and import them into your new one.\nIf you have your passwords stored manually in a spreadsheet, you can also import that into your new manager too, providing you follow the correct formatting for the manager in question.\nWhat are the most secure password managers?\nUnderstandably, this is one of the most important questions to ask of a password manager. You would expect any password manager worth its salt would be secure as a given, but no one is perfect and some have had issues. LastPass, for instance, although a very reputable and popular choice, did suffer a security breach, and although the company reassured users that no passwords were accessible, it is still a cause for concern.\nThe managers offered by big tech companies, mainly Google and Apple, are generally very secure, as you might expect. Not only do they have the pockets deep enough to maintain the best protection possible, it would also be a huge PR disaster should they incur any major breaches, and companies of that size have an awful lot to lose.\nHow safe are password managers?\nAll the best password managers are very safe, using the best encryption methods to store your passwords securely.\nZero-knowledge architecture is one of the core principles for managers to keep your passwords as safe as possible. This means that no one but the user has access to the passwords contained in the encrypted vault. Even the vendor and providers of the cloud backup service for your passwords are unable to see what your passwords actually are - only you have the power to decrypt your stored passwords, using your master password, or biometric data if you have this set up on supported password managers.\nComplex algorithms are used to encrypt passwords, and there are different methods. Some managers, such as NordPass, use something called XChaCha20, which is military grade and considered to be at the cutting edge of current encryption technology. It is also favored by big tech companies like Google, and is faster than more traditional methods such as AES-256.\nAlso, NordPass claims that such methods may be crackable with new technologies - for instance, quantum computing could put traditional methods of encryption at risk - but it believes XChaCha20 is resistant to these dangers.\nAll good password managers will also allow for biometric login and feature multi-factor authentication, two aspects which most people will be familiar with by now. The former involves technologies that recognize the physical aspects of the user, such as fingerprint scanners and facial recognition cameras, to authenticate them as the legitimate user.\nMulti-factor authentication is an added layer of security on top of your password to make sure that it\u2019s actually you who has entered your password on a given site or service, usually by sending a text message code on your phone that you have to input to make sure it is you. There are also separate authenticator apps you can have on your phone that give you a code to authenticate your login instead, if you\u2019d rather not receive an SMS code.\nAnd as with any piece of digital tech, how it is used by an individual or business goes a long way in determining how secure it remains. At the very least, make sure you are accessing your manager on a secure and protected network - always be cautious when using them in spaces with public wifi - and make sure you're using the best malware removal tools and the best antivirus software for your system.\nSmartphones are generally very secure in this regard, although you should always be careful when downloading apps to make sure they are trustworthy - the Google Play store, for instance, has had its fair share of malicious apps doing the rounds recently.\nAlso, if you are using a master password to secure your password vault, then make sure it is a strong one. This will be one that you will have to remember yourself, so a long and complex string of various random characters will probably be out of the question.\nCurrent expert advice suggests that for passwords you choose yourself, a string of three random words together is quite strong, as it will be hard to guess and easy to remember for yourself. Whatever you use, just make sure to avoid ones that are easy to crack, like your mother\u2019s maiden name, your birthday, or \u2018password1234\u2019.\nCan a password manager be hacked?\nIn a word: yes - in the sense that virtually any computer system can be hacked in theory. But the password managers in our list have a great safety record and utilize industry-standard encryption methods to protect your most valuable of assets. If we ever catch wind of any compromises to their security posture, we\u2019ll be sure to let you know straight away.\nOf course, many of you will probably be aware by now of the breach suffered by LastPass, one of the most popular password managers around, where users\u2019 password vaults were stolen. The company did assure them that they remained encrypted, so unless the hackers also guessed their master passwords too, they should remain safe. However, other personal data that were stolen, including names, payment information and the addresses of their IP, email and physical location, were not encrypted. For these reasons, LastPass no longer makes it onto our list of the best password managers.\nSpeaking of encryption, all good managers will use the strongest methods available when storing user passwords in their databases, which are extremely difficult to crack without the digital keys needed to unlock them. So the question then becomes can a hacker obtain these keys? In the case of LastPass, its subsidiary, GoTo, recently announced the encryption keys for its users\u2019 accounts were stolen in the same attack that affected the password manager, but it is yet to confirm whether the same is true for its service.\nLastPass isn\u2019t the only password manager to succumb to a breach, however. Many Norton LifeLock users had their accounts hacked in late 2022 via a credential stuffing attack, with the company warning them that unwarranted access to the suite\u2019s password manager may have occurred.\nPasswordstate also saw its users fall victim to a devious fake software update that stole their stored passwords. Unsurprisingly, none of these password managers made it onto our list.\nShould you use your browser to manage your passwords?\nIt of course makes sense from a convenience perspective to use your browser\u2019s integrated password manager, such as that in Google Chrome. And although it is a perfectly solid choice, there are various reasons why you may want a dedicated password manager instead or in addition to your browser\u2019s.\nFirstly, your browser\u2019s password manager will likely not work with other devices quite so easily.\nIf you use Google Chrome on a desktop and have an iPhone, then passwords associated with apps will not be saved to the manager in Chrome - by default they will be saved to Apple\u2019s own password manager, Keychain. Keychain and Chrome password managers will not sync together, and there is no browser extension for Keychain that will work on Chrome. Therefore, you will be running two managers concurrently, one used for mobile app passwords, and the other for website passwords. If you have an account for a service that has both a website and an app, then they will be saved to both managers separately.\nAs you can imagine, things can start to get messy and disorganized fast. The solution would be to have a dedicated, third-party manager like those on this list, so they can centralize and sync all your passwords for both websites and apps across all your devices. They will usually have an app for mobile and for desktop, as well as an integrated extension compatible with most common web browsers, so no matter what platform you\u2019re on, you\u2019ll always have access to your passwords.\nSecondly, dedicated password managers often come with a lot more useful extras. For instance, a small but useful feature of many password managers is the ability to give a nickname to your account passwords, so you can locate them easily. Sometimes, you will find that searching for your account credentials by username or by the URL that the account is stored on may not yield the results you're looking for.\nWhere to find the password manager on Chrome\nGoogle Chrome is the most popular web browser in the world right now, so there\u2019s a good chance you're using its integrated password manager already.\nOn desktop platforms, you\u2019ll find it under settings - autofill - password manager. You can see all your passwords here, and search for them via their username or the web page they are used on. It will also show you any passwords that have been compromised, based on known data breaches and leaks.\nThere is also the Google Password manager, which is the official password manager for Android, and has now taken over the integrated manager in Chrome as well. This means it now stores passwords you use on Android apps as well, not just website passwords.\nDo password managers work with apps?\nAll the best password managers will have an app associated with them, and will work on both Android and Apple iOS devices. This means that passwords you use for other apps will be able to be stored in your password manager and easily accessible on your device, allowing for instant login.\nThey will be cross-platform, so can be used across all your different devices, as well as having an extension you can download to allow them to work in popular browsers, such as Google Chrome and Apple's Safari.\nHowever, as many smart devices now have biometric login capabilities, such as using fingerprint scanners and facial recognition, a lot of apps will simply require this to log in instead, without the need to input a password every time. This biometric data is stored on the device itself, such as your iPhone or Android phone, so a password manager isn\u2019t used in these cases.\nHowever, many password managers now support biometric data too, so you can save it to the manager as well.\nHow to choose the top password managers\nChoosing the best password manager comes down to your personal needs, and whether others will be using it in addition to yourself, such as your family or the rest of your business.\nThe top two on our list, NordPass and Dashlane, are arguably the best all-round password managers available, more than capable of servicing anyone from single users to large organizations. But if you don\u2019t want to pay a penny for a password manager, then there\u2019s only one choice in our view: Bitwarden.\nHere are some key considerations when choosing a password manager:\n1. Security: This is of course one of the most important aspects of any password manager. We have done our best to check every manager featured in this guide adheres to best practices in terms of securing your vault and personal data.\nThey will use industry standard encryption methods to ensure that no one knows what your passwords are. Some will also offer biometric login in addition to or instead of a master password, and many will also offer two-factor authentication (2FA) to help prevent hackers accessing your account if they somehow manage to steal your master password.\nMany are also starting to support passkeys as a way of logging in too, which are thought to be both easier and more secure than using a master password.\n2. Synchronization: Although many other vendors will offer free versions of their managers, be aware that oftentimes, some fairly basic features will be omitted, such as cross-platform synchronization and unlimited storage and devices. Bitwarden does include these, though.\n3. Compatibility: We\u2019ve also indicated what platforms and browsers each manager is compatible with, which is another very important consideration when choosing a password manager. In fact, it is one of the main advantages of using a third-party password manager in the first place, since managers integrated with Apple, Google and Microsoft products will usually only work within their respective ecosystems.\nThe managers in this list, though, will work across at least some of them, since they will be compatible with Windows and Mac (and even Linux in some cases), as well as Android and iPhone.\nFor those who value the utmost privacy when online, you should look for a password manager that has a browser extension for specialist privacy browsers, like Brave. Again, we\u2019ve done our best to inform you which browsers and platforms each manager works with.\n4. Price: When it comes to price, bear in mind that while many will show monthly costs, they will often bill you annually, so keep in mind that you will have to part with a larger sum rather than spreading the cost throughout the year.\nMost managers on the market today will charge anywhere from $10 to $60 a year for individual plans, with family plans being somewhat more expensive. Business plans, on the other hand, can be more costly, and some even offer tailor-made enterprise plans that will require consultation before getting a quote.\nHow we tested the best password managers\nWe tested close to 30 of the most prominent password managers around, and picked out the very best to feature in this guide. During our testing, we made sure to try them out on every platform possible, to make sure they offered a consistent experience across all manner of devices and browsers.\nWe spent a considerable amount of time with each password manager to ensure that there were no nasty surprises that wouldn't necessarily crop up during a brief run through. We also tried to use them in every kind of situation we could think of, again in an effort to reveal any shortcomings that may have otherwise gone unnoticed.\nThe last thing you want to do is to change your password manager after discovering major flaws or aspects that you personally can\u2019t live with, so we do our best to be as thorough as possible and consider all the different types of users that will deploy password managers for their specific wants and needs.\nHowever, it is worth noting that good password managers usually offer easy ways to export your vault from one manager to another, so if you don\u2019t personally like a manager after spending a lot of time with it, don\u2019t feel you\u2019re stuck; most vendors offer easy-to-follow guides on switching to their manager from others - they want to win your custom, after all.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

      "text": "Best Authenticator App for 2025: Features and Security Reviewed and Compared\nAdd an extra layer of online security with the best authenticator app\nAuthenticator apps are security tools that enhance the security of your online accounts. They work by enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA), which adds an extra layer of verification beyond just a username and password. Since passwords alone can be easily stolen, guessed, or leaked in data breaches, authenticator apps help ensure that even if someone has your login credentials, they still can\u2019t access your account without a second form of authentication.\nAuthenticator apps typically work by generating time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs), which are unique codes that refresh every 30 seconds. When you log in to an account protected by 2FA, you'll be prompted to enter the current code displayed in your authenticator app. Because the code changes constantly and is tied to your device, it\u2019s virtually impossible for a hacker to guess. In some cases, authenticator apps can also send push notifications that you simply approve to confirm your identity.\nMany authenticator apps go a step further by offering biometric verification, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, to open the app or to approve a login request. This adds another layer of protection, ensuring that even if someone has access to your device, they still can\u2019t bypass authentication without your physical presence. Overall, authenticator apps provide a simple yet powerful way to safeguard your digital identity and reduce the risk of account takeovers.\nOur security experts have been testing and evaluating authenticator apps for years, looking at how each one verifies your identity, its compatibility across devices and platforms, adherence to security and compliance standards, overall usability, and the range of additional security features it offers.\nWe've also listed the best security keys and the best password managers.\nReader Offer: Save 61% on NordPass for Business\nNordPass provides an easy-to-use and highly secure solution that most businesses will love, according to Techradar editors. Plans start at less than $1.79 per user per month - plus get 3 months extra.\nPreferred partner (What does this mean?)\nThe best authenticator apps of 2025 in full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest authenticator app overall\n1. Authenticator App by 2Stable\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Authenticator App by 2Stable delivers a robust suite of features for users who value both privacy and convenience.\nOne area where the app excels is in secure cloud sync, which works through iCloud. This helps sync your 2FA codes across your iPhone, iPad, Mac, and even your Apple Watch. For users embedded in the Apple ecosystem, this significantly enhances the user experience. It also includes biometric authentication features adding yet another layer of protection.\nWe also like the app\u2019s backup and restore functionality that stores 2FA tokens in an encrypted format, which helps reduce the risk of being locked out if you change or lose your device.\nOther thoughtful touches include Apple Watch support, widgets for quick access, multiple import options, the ability to use the app without creating an account, and a lot more.\nThe app\u2019s biggest limitation is that it isn\u2019t available on Android devices, though the developers claim this is in the works. The $50 annual price tag could be another hindrance for many, though the app offers a feature-restricted free version that can manage two accounts.\nAll things considered, 2Stable\u2019s Authenticator app is best suited for users who view security and convenience as equally important, and don\u2019t mind paying a premium for both.\nBest authenticator app for security\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDeveloped by the makers of NordVPN, NordPass Authenticator benefits from the company\u2019s established reputation in digital security. That said, NordPass Authenticator isn\u2019t a general-purpose authenticator app. Instead the app is built for companies that already rely on NordPass Business for their password management needs.\nUsing NordPass Authenticator saves NordPass Business users the effort to copy codes from a separate app, as it allows all your employees to generate and use TOTP codes directly within the NordPass Business vault. This simplifies the login process for enterprise users and reduces friction in daily workflows.\nAlso, because it\u2019s part of the NordPass Business infrastructure, admins can enforce policies around 2FA usage, monitor access logs, and maintain visibility into how 2FA is being used within your organization. That level of control simply doesn\u2019t exist in standalone authenticator apps.\nOn the downside though, NordPass Authenticator lacks the robust backup and recovery features found in other authenticator apps. There\u2019s no option for cloud backups, like you get with 2Stable\u2019s authenticator app, nor the ability to restore your tokens on a new device. In the same vein, it also lacks any ability to sync tokens across multiple devices.\nNordPass Authenticator is bundled along with the NordPass Business product, plans for which start from $1.99/user/month when paid for a year, or $1.79/user/month when subscribed for two years.\nBest cross-platform authenticator app\n3. Authy\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAuthy is a popular 2FA app that\u2019s developed by Twilio. The app stands out for its ease of use and advanced features despite being available for free, and has a clean, responsive, and easy to navigate user interface.\nNot only does Authy support both Android and iOS, it also doesn\u2019t restrict you to a single device. Thanks to its multi-device sync you can access your 2FA tokens across your smartphones, and tablets.\nAlso, unlike many other apps in the genre, Authy offers more than just basic 2FA functionality. One of its most popular features is the encrypted cloud backup system. This helps you access your 2FA token even if you lose or replace your phone. You can also lock Authy behind a PIN, fingerprint, or facial recognition, which adds an extra layer of protection.\nYet, despite its strong feature set, Authy isn't without drawbacks. For starters, your Authy account is tied to your phone number. This makes you vulnerable to SIM swap attacks and also means you\u2019re sharing personal information with Twilio.\nAlso, once you\u2019ve set up 2FA tokens in Authy, moving them to another app isn't straightforward as there\u2019s no mechanism to export your data. So, if you ever want to switch to another authenticator, you\u2019ll have to laboriously first disable 2FA on each of your online accounts and then re-enable it using the new authenticator app.\nBest authenticator app for ease of use\n4. Google Authenticator\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMany folks have a love/hate relationship with Google and if you're in the latter category, you probably want to move on to the next option on this list. For everyone else, say hello to the easiest and most basic authenticator app on the planet.\nGoogle Authenticator has been around for over a decade, is free, and will work with virtually every service that supports TOTPs. The app is as streamlined as it gets. There are no bloated menus, and you don\u2019t need to set up an account to use the app.\nFor a long time that was the extent of Google Authenticator\u2019s capabilities. But the app has received significant updates in 2025. The biggest news for Google Authenticator users is the introduction of cloud syncing. You can now backup your codes to your Google account and sync it across all your devices, whether they're Android phones, iPhones, or iPads, as long as they are logged into the same Google account. The app now also has a Privacy Screen feature, which helps protect access with your device's screen lock, PIN, or fingerprint, and facial recognition.\nDespite the improvements, there are a few areas where it lags behind some of its peers. For instance, while there is a search facility to find specific accounts, you don\u2019t get any organization features that you get with some other apps like Authy. Also, Google Authenticator remains a mobile-only app, and while it does work on iOS devices as well, unlike Duo Mobile, it can only backup and sync to a Google account.\nBest authenticator app for enterprise\n5. Duo Mobile\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDeveloped by Cisco, Duo Mobile is best known for its use in corporate environments. Duo Mobile does more than just generate time-based TOTPs. It's built to work as part of a broader identity and access management system, but many of its core features make it a solid 2FA app even for personal use, especially since it\u2019s available for free.\nDuo Mobile works on Apple and Android phones, and tablets, as well as on smart watches. The app has a straightforward interface that makes it easy to manage multiple accounts.\nOne of the standout features of Duo Mobile is push-based approval. Instead of typing in a 6-digit code, supported services can send you a push notification on your phone when trying to log in. Simply tap \"Approve\" and you're in. It\u2019s fast, intuitive, and eliminates the need to manually input codes.\nThat said, the app also supports standard TOTP codes, so you can still use Duo Mobile to generate codes just like you would with other authenticator apps. The app also supports account recovery through secure cloud backups, via iCloud on iOS and Google Drive on Android.\nBut while you can back up and restore accounts, you can\u2019t actively sync the codes between devices like you can with Authy or 2Stable\u2019s Authenticator app. Similarly, Duo Mobile is a mobile-only app. So if you're looking to access your 2FA tokens from a computer or browser, you'll need to look elsewhere.\nBest authenticator app for LastPass users\n6. LastPass Authenticator\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nLastPass Authenticator is a good enough 2FA app, but it works best as an add-on for LastPass password manager users, rather than as a top-tier general-purpose authenticator on its own.\nThe app has a clean, user-friendly interface, and the process to add, remove, and view tokens is pretty straightforward. Like most 2FA apps, LastPass Authenticator works with virtually any online service that supports TOTPs. The app also scores for supporting fingerprint, and PIN protections, which helps keep your tokens secure if someone gets access to your unlocked phone.\nThat said, while it works as a general 2FA app, many of its interesting features are tied to your LastPass account.\nFor instance, unlike some of its peers, like Authy, which allows real-time sync across multiple devices, LastPass Authenticator only backs up and restores tokens through your LastPass account.\nIt also supports push notification for login approval, but again only when paired with the LastPass password manager. While it works on both Android and iOS, the app is strictly mobile-only, and doesn\u2019t have a desktop or browser extension.\nAll things considered, while LastPass Authenticator is functional as a standalone 2FA app, it doesn\u2019t offer much for non-LastPass users.\nBest authenticator app for Microsoft users\n7. Microsoft Authenticator\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMicrosoft Authenticator is a good authenticator app, but it's primarily designed with Microsoft account users in mind. The app is available for both Android and iOS, works with any service that supports 2FA, and is fairly intuitive to use. It also offers a search function to sort through your 2FA accounts, which is helpful if you\u2019ve enabled it for several services.\nThe app also by default locks itself behind the device\u2019s biometric and PIN to add an extra layer of protection if someone gets access to your phone.\nAnd that\u2019s the extent of its non-Microsoft account linked features. The app offers an encrypted cloud backup of your 2FA tokens, but this is linked to your Microsoft Account, or iCloud for iOS users.\nAlso, if you use Microsoft services, you\u2019ll benefit from push-based logins that you can approve with a tap. Like many of its peers, Microsoft Authenticator too is a mobile-only app.\nFor a long time, Microsoft Authenticator has offered password autofill and even some basic password management functions. However, as of August 2025, these features are being deprecated to make the app a streamlined authenticator app, which further limits its appeal to non-Microsoft account users.\nBest authenticator app for Apple users\n8. Step Two\nOur expert review:\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nStep Two is a good authenticator app that\u2019s designed specifically for the Apple ecosystem. While it\u2019s not the most feature-rich authenticator out there, it offers a clean, distraction-free interface that works well across iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch. If you regularly use multiple Apple devices, Step Two ensures your codes are available on all of them without any manual setup.\nTokens are automatically and securely synced via iCloud. This means your 2FA tokens are always backed up and restored across devices tied to your Apple ID cutting out the risk of losing access to them if you upgrade your phone.\nYou can use the app for free to manage up to 10 accounts/services. For a one-time purchase of $10, you can use Step Two to handle any number of accounts.\nThe biggest drawback of the app is that it is made exclusively for Apple platforms. This means that if you ever switch to Android, there's no way for you to transfer your tokens from Step Two.\nThe app also falls short of 2Stable\u2019s authenticator app in terms of features. For starters, it only supports the Safari browser, unlike 2Stable\u2019s that supports all the best web browsers.\nAuthenticator app FAQs\nHow to choose the best authenticator apps\nWhen deciding which authenticator app to use, first consider what your actual needs are, as sometimes free and budget software may only provide basic options, so if you need to use advanced tools you may find a paid platform is much more worthwhile. Additionally, higher-end software can really cater for every need, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require from your authenticator app.\nHow do authenticator apps work?\nWithout fail, one of the easiest ways to begin using 2FA is by using your smartphone's camera and scanning a QR code provided by the company or website. Once you do, the authentication app gets to work by issuing an ever-changing unique code. That code is valid as the second form of identification for just a few seconds before the authentication app refreshes it.\nYou only have to scan the QR code once on a device. If you're using sync and backup (like many of the apps below), you probably won't have to scan a QR code during setup on another device. Otherwise, you will.\nThe codes are generated using a standard HMAC-Based One-Time Password (HOTP) algorithm developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). However, at no time does the IETF gain access to the codes.\nIs 2FA all the protection we need?\nWhen 2FA options first arrived, many thought online vulnerability would finally end in the tech world. But, unfortunately, that isn't the case. 2FA, like every other form of online security, isn't 100% secure. Try as they might, a hacker or two will figure out a way to gain access to something they shouldn't. In January 2022, for example, Crypto.com was attacked. Nearly 500 accounts were compromised, and the thieves made off with more than $31 million in cryptocurrencies.\nDespite its imperfections, 2FA still provides better protection than passwords alone.\nHow we tested the best authenticator apps\nTo test for the best authenticator apps we first set up an account with the relevant platform. We then tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each authenticator app to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

Operation Eastwood, supported by Europol and Eurojust, saw 12 countries take simultaneous actions against offenders and infrastructure belonging to the criminal network.\nAs a result of the operations, 2 suspects were arrested, 7 arrest warrants were issued, 24 houses were searched, 100 servers were disrupted, over 1,000 supporters were notified of their legal liability, and major parts of the NoName057(16) main infrastructure were taken offline.\nThe criminal network unsurprisingly primarily attacked targets in Ukraine, but had recently shifted its focus to Ukraine\u2019s allies in the Russia/Ukraine war, many of which are NATO members.\nAdvanced privacy threats need advanced protection\nCriminals now use AI to invade your online privacy and scam you, making it hard to stay safer online.

While the company is famous for providing free antivirus software, it's worth noting that this now comes bundled with an anti-malware feature that uses behavioral monitoring to spot rogue programs.\nWhat's even better is that not only are Avast's basic products free, but they are also available for mobile devices as well as for desktops, which makes Avast a particular ideal choice if you have multiple devices you need to check.\nEven better is that ransomware protection is included in the free version of the Avast Antivirus platform, so you don't even need to pay to upgrade for this, though additional security features are available if you do.\nFor business users, there are paid-for internet security options to cover a range of needs and options.\nRead our full Avast Antivirus review.\nBest ransomware protection for a lightweight solution\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nJust about every antivirus tool claims to be \u2018lightweight\u2019, but Webroot Antivirus is really the only one to deliver on this front. Installation takes seconds, the program files barely use 2MB of your hard drive, RAM footprint is tiny, and there are no bulky signature updates to tie up your bandwidth.\nConsidering this, there's no compromise on features, which makes it all the more impressive. Along with the core protection, there's smart behavior monitoring, accurate real-time anti-phishing, a firewall and network connection monitor, enhanced anti-ransomware, and other interesting bonuses.\nIt's not easy to compare Webroot's accuracy with the competition, as the big testing labs rarely evaluate the company's products. However, when they are reviewed, they generally score high, and our own tests show solid and reliable protection.\nFeatures include always-on security, identity protection, real-time anti-phishing, firewall monitor.\nRead our full Webroot Antivirus review.\nFind the best deals on Webroot products with our Webroot promo codes.\nBest ransomware protection for experts\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you judge antivirus software on the length of its feature list, ESET NOD32 Antivirus might be a bit of a disappointment. There\u2019s no firewall, password manager, file shredder, vulnerability scanner or any of the bundled bonuses you'll often find in its rivals.\nThis doesn't mean the package is short on power, however. It's just more focused on the fundamentals. ESET NOD32 Antivirus comes with real-time malware protection, some of the best heuristic detection around, an anti-ransomware layer, exploit protection, URL filtering to block malicious websites, and modules to prevent attacks using PowerShell and malicious scripts.\nA Device Control module limits the risk of infection from other devices by controlling access to USB sticks, external hard drives, optical storage media, even devices connecting by Bluetooth and FireWire. It's an unusual addition, but could make a difference if others are regularly plugging devices into your PC.\nJust bear in mind that ESET NOD32 Antivirus isn't aimed at beginners. The interface is clumsy sometimes, some features are very advanced, and even the Help isn't always helpful.\nExperienced users will appreciate ESET\u2019s power and configurability, however. Above-average protection does a good job of keeping you safe, and a lightweight design ensures the package won't slow you down.\nESET Internet Security builds on NOD 32 and triples the number of devices covered plus offers firewall, botnet protection, webcam protection, antispam and more. Alternatively, you can purchase the ESET Smart Security Premium edition for not much more. It adds all of the above as well as password management and secure data.\nRead our full ESET NOD32 Antivirus review.\nBest ransomware removal software\nThe best malware removal software available right now is: Malwarebytes Premium\nIf you're suffering from a malware infection and free software isn't getting the job done, Malwarebytes Premium could be the silver bullet you need. It uses heuristic analysis to identify new strains of malware, cleans up existing infections, helps protect you from phishing scams, and helps stop you downloading further malicious software in the future, including ransomware.\nBest ransomware removal software overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you have a ransomware infection, Malwarebytes Anti-Malware should be your first port of call. It\u2019s updated daily, so you can trust it to identify and remove new threats the minute they appear.\nThe first time you install Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, you\u2019re given a 14-day trial of the premium edition, which includes preventative tools like real-time scanning and specific protection from ransomware. After two weeks, it reverts to the basic free version. This has to be activated manually, but is still a top-notch security tool. We recommend running it at least once a week to check or any nasties that you haven't noticed, or if you notice that your web browser has suddenly started acting strangely (likely a result of adware).\nRecently, Malwarebytes bought Adwcleaner, which \u2013 as its name suggests \u2013 targets and removes annoying programs that hijack your browser by changing your homepage, resetting your default search engine, or adding unwanted toolbars. It\u2019s also available free, and along with Anti-Malware, is a great addition to your security toolkit.\nRead our full Malwarebytes Anti-Malware review.\nBest free ransomware removal software\n2. Avast Free Ransomware Decryption Tools\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNot all ransomware encrypts data in the same way, so security software providers have to create specific solutions as new threats emerge. At the time of writing, the security experts at Avast have developed Free Ransomware Decryption Tools to tackle 21 different strains of file-locking ransomware.\nTo help you work out which one you need, Avast has provided a detailed description of how each form of ransomware works, what extension you\u2019ll see on the encrypted files, and an example of the type of message the virus creators have prepared for their victims.\nOnce you\u2019ve downloaded the appropriate tool, it will guide you through the process of wiping out the ransomware without paying the criminals. You\u2019ll need to provide two versions of the same file \u2013 an encrypted one, and the original.\nThis will be easiest if you made a backup before the infection, but Avast also suggests locations where you might be able to find unaffected original files. The tool will then compare the two and use the results to determine the password.\nWe've listed the best endpoint protection software.\nBest ransomware protection FAQs\nWhat is ransomware?\nAdam Kujawa, Director of Malwarebytes Labs:\n\u201cThe term malware, or \u2018malicious software,\u2019 is an umbrella term that describes any malicious program or code that is harmful to systems, including ransomware. Hostile, intrusive, and intentionally nasty, malware seeks to invade, damage, or disable computers, computer systems, networks, tablets, and mobile devices, often by taking partial control over a device\u2019s operations. Like the human flu, it interferes with normal functioning. The motives behind malware vary - it can be about making money off you, sabotaging your ability to get work done, making a political statement, or just bragging rights.\"\nHow to choose the best ransomware protection for you?\nWhen deciding which ransomware protection to use, first consider what your actual needs are, as budget software may only provide basic options, so if you need to use advanced tools you may find a more expensive platform is much more worthwhile. Additionally, higher-end software can usually cater for every need, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require from your ransomware protection.\nHow we test\nTo test for the best ransomware protection we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, then we tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each ransomware protection platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nWe've also rated the best identity management software.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

The operation, coordinated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and international partners, led to the seizure of critical infrastructure used by the group, including servers and digital assets. Despite this disruption, experts warn that the threat actors may quickly reestablish their operations, as no arrests were made during the operation.",
