  "description": "Russia and China have solidified their strategic energy cooperation by signing a legally binding memorandum to advance the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline project, further integrating their economies and challenging Western influence.",
  "content": "Russia and China used a Eurasian summit this week to manifest closer ties in defiance of the U.S., pledging increased cooperation and signing about two dozen agreements, including in the energy sector.\n\nDuring the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in China, Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Chinese President Xi Jinping for bilateral talks and multi-lateral discussions agreements with the leaders of about 20 non-Western nations, including India. The Chinese signaled to the West a new world order in which Eurasian strongmen will not be bullied by the United States, and threats and tariffs will only push closer ties within the anti-West axis.\n\nThe summit was also a stage on which countries announced stronger cooperation in many fields, including military, industry, and energy.\n\nRussia and China, in particular, signed a legally binding memorandum to move forward with a second major pipeline to carry natural gas from Russia\u2019s huge Siberian gas fields to China via Mongolia.\n\nThe agreement was announced on Tuesday by Alexey Miller, the chief executive of Russia\u2019s gas giant Gazprom, who signed the deal with China\u2019s state energy firm CNPC for the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline.\n\nRussia is betting on selling increased volumes of energy products to China after losing Europe as a key oil and gas export market following Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine. Gazprom has lost most of the European market, reported an annual loss for the first time in more than two decades, and is threatened by the EU pledge to end dependency on Russian energy, including a halt to all imports of Russian gas by the end of 2027. So it is only natural that Gazprom believes that its future revenues and sales will come from the East.\n\nRussia has tried for years to get China to commit to the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline, without success. Now a legally binding memorandum has been signed, but key sticking points remain \u2013 including the price China will (be willing to) pay for the supply. It\u2019s not clear who and how will finance the huge multi-billion-dollar project, either.\n\nCurrently, Russia supplies pipeline gas to China via the Power of Siberia pipeline, one of the biggest projects recently completed by Gazprom and the first conduit for Russian gas to China.\n\nPower of Siberia 2 is designed to ship gas from Russia\u2019s Western Siberia Altai region to northeast China via Mongolia.\n\nThe memorandum on Power of Siberia 2 signed on Tuesday doesn\u2019t include details and issues such as prices or capacity commitments, so the key sticking points remain.",

      "text": "The EU has dropped its share of Russian gas imports from 45% to 19%, thanks to the REPowerEU Plan, launched in May 2022 to reduce the EU\u2019s dependency on Russian energy. However, the EU saw a rebound in Russian gas imports in 2024. The European Commission has therefore presented a roadmap to ensure the EU fully ends its dependency on Russian energy, while ensuring stable energy supplies and prices across the EU. The roadmap will see a gradual removal of Russian oil, gas and nuclear energy from the EU markets in a coordinated and secure manner as the EU transitions to clean energy. EU countries will prepare national plans by the end of 2025 setting out how they will contribute to phasing out imports of Russian gas, nuclear energy and oil. At the same time, efforts will continue to accelerate the EU\u2019s energy transition and diversify energy supplies to eliminate risks to the security of supply and market stability. The roadmap includes measures to gas: stop all imports of Russian gas by the end of 2027 by improving the transparency, monitoring and traceability of Russian gas across the EU markets. New contracts with suppliers of Russian gas will be prevented and spot contracts (for immediate payment) will be stopped by the end of 2025.oil: take fresh action to address Russia's \u2018shadow fleet\u2019 (vessels employed by Russia to evade sanctions) transporting oilnuclear: restrict new supply contracts co-signed by the Euratom Supply Agency for uranium, enriched uranium and other nuclear materials deriving from Russia By phasing out Russian energy, the REPowerEU roadmap will reduce the security risks the EU is facing. It will also contribute to the economic plan set out by the Competitiveness Compass, the Clean Industrial Deal and the Affordable energy action plan. A cleaner and independent energy system helps boost the economy while also making a huge contribution to Europe's decarbonisation ambitions. The Commission will put forward legislative proposals to support the roadmap next month.

      "text": "A new IISS report warns\u2026\nA massive Russian airstrike killed\u2026\nRussia's Gazprom Group, a state-controlled energy giant, has disclosed its first annual net loss in 23 years, signaling a significant shift in financial performance attributed to dwindling gas shipments to Europe and pricing pressures.\nIn the wake of restricted gas flows to Europe, historically Gazprom's primary market, and plummeting gas prices exacerbated by geopolitical tensions, Gazprom Group, which encompasses oil and power ventures alongside its core gas operations, reported a substantial 629 billion-ruble ($6.84 billion) loss for the fiscal year, contrasting starkly with the net income of 1.23 trillion rubles in 2022.\nThe market response has been notable, with Gazprom's shares experiencing a sharp 4.4% decline, reflecting investor concerns over dividend prospects. Gazprom's principal shareholder, the Russian government, faces fiscal strain amidst heightened military expenditures and ongoing Western sanctions.\nThe decline in gas revenues, underscored by a 40% drop in gas revenue to 4.88 trillion rubles, has led Gazprom to explore revenue diversification strategies. Despite gas revenue setbacks, the group witnessed positive performances in its oil and power segments, with revenue from the oil business rising by 6.7% to 3.88 trillion rubles and sales at its power utilities business increasing by 8.8% to 617 billion rubles.\nDespite efforts to increase gas shipments to foreign markets, notably to China, Gazprom continues to grapple with the loss of its traditional European market. While the Power of Siberia link to China is gradually reaching its nameplate capacity, it cannot fully offset the decline in European gas demand.\nThese financial challenges come amidst a broader context of Gazprom's diminishing profitability, with the first half of 2023 witnessing a significant decline in net profit compared to previous years, highlighting the ongoing economic pressures facing the energy giant.\nBy Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:\nJulianne Geiger is a veteran editor, writer and researcher for Oilprice.com, and a member of the Creative Professionals Networking Group."

The Power of Siberia 2 project will be the largest and the most capital-intensive project in the global gas industry, CEO of the Russian gas holding Gazprom Alexey Miller told reporters.\n\"It should be understood that the project of the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline construction and the Soyuz Vostok gas pipeline construction, the transit gas pipeline via Mongolia and related gas transport facilities in China, it will now be the largest, having the greatest scale and the most capital-intensive project in the gas industry globally,\" Miller said.\nThe fundamental document on this project has been signed today, the chief executive said. \"This is the legally binding memorandum,\" he noted.\nIssues related to financing of gas pipeline construction and commercial terms of supplies will be discussed and updated now, he added."
