  "description": "The meeting came after Trump on Monday announced plans to use a 1973 D.C. Home Rule Act provision to send National Guard troops to D.C. and temporarily federalize the city.",
  "content": "Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser and the city's police chief traveled to Justice Department headquarters on Tuesday to meet with Attorney General Pam Bondi and other senior administration officials to discuss the temporary National Guard takeover in the nation's capital.\n\nThe meeting came hours after President announced plans Monday to temporarily federalize law enforcement in the nation's capital, both through deploying hundreds of D.C. National Guard troops, and taking control in the near-term of the city's local police force.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the meeting, Bowser said the sit-down was focused on coordination and strategy with the federal government.\n\n\"What I\u2019m focused on is the federal surge and how to make the most of the additional officer support that we have,\" Bowser said. \"We have the best in the business with [Metropolitan Police Chief] Pamela Smith to lead that effort, and to make sure that the men and women who are coming from federal law enforcement are being well-used, and that if there\u2019s National Guard here they\u2019re being well-used.\"\n\nIS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT\n\nThe meeting with Bondi and other senior Trump officials, including FBI Director Kash Patel and U.S. Marshals Service Director Gady Serralta, came after Trump on Monday announced plans to use a 1973 D.C. Home Rule Act provision to send National Guard troops to D.C., as part of an effort to \"reestablish law order and public safety\" and temporarily federalize the city.\n\nD.C. officials, for their part, also urged calm on Tuesday, with Chief Smith stressing to reporters that they regularly work alongside federal law enforcement officials. \"I think this is going to be a good effort,\" she said Tuesday.\n\n\"It's going to be an effort that's supported by both teams, the Metropolitan Police Department, as well as our federal partners,\" she said.\n\n\"What we've done at this point is we have provided the team \u2013 the administrator \u2013 with a strategic plan on how we will provide resources around our city,\" she said.\n\n\"I think it's something that is doable. We know that we have to get illegal guns off of our streets, and if we have this influx or enhanced presence, it's going to make our city even better.\"\n\nFBI OUSTS FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR, AGENT INVOLVED IN J6 PROSECUTIONS, WITH MORE EXPECTED\n\nThe effort was separately praised by Bondi, who described the sit-down with Bowser on social media as \"productive.\"\n\n\"We agreed that there is nothing more important than keeping residents and tourists in Washington, D.C., safe from deadly crime,\" Bondi said on Tuesday. \"At President Trump\u2019s direction, @TheJusticeDept will work closely with D.C. city government and [the] @DCPoliceDept to make Washington, D.C. safe again.\"\n\nTrump has long vowed to \"clean up\" D.C., a goal he has stressed since his first term in office.\n\nTrump in March signed an executive order, \"Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force,\" designed to address issues with a city he has long derided as \"filthy,\" \"horribly run\" and \"crime-ridden,\" among other things.\n\n\"We want to have a great, safe capital,\" he told reporters earlier this year. \"And we\u2019re going to have it. And that includes cleanliness and it includes other things.\"\n\nBowser stressed at a press conference Monday that crime rates have fallen in the city, pointing to preliminary figures compiled by the D.C. Police Department and released earlier this year.\n\nSince then, \"We haven\u2019t taken our foot off the gas,\" Bowser said Monday. She said D.C. is continuing its efforts to fight violent crime, even without the authorities of a full state.\n\n\"I can\u2019t say that given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we\u2019re totally surprised\" by the Trump administration's efforts, Bowser said during the press conference Monday. \"I can say to D.C. residents that we will continue to operate our government in a way that makes you proud.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMeanwhile, the DC Police Union also said Monday that it supported the administration taking over the police force, but stressed they backed the move only so long as it is a \"temporary measure.\"",

      "text": "President Donald Trump is weighing whether to deploy up to 1,000 National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., as early as this week, Fox News has learned, in an effort to help deal with what he characterized as a surge in violent crime.\nThe plans come just one day after Trump vowed on Truth Social to evict homeless persons from that nation's capital. \"The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,\" Trump said on social media. \"We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital. The Criminals, you don\u2019t have to move out. We\u2019re going to put you in jail where you belong.\"\nTrump's plans, which are expected to be detailed further at a 10 a.m. press conference Monday, would likely involve members of the D.C. National Guard, or the 2,700-member National Guard force that acts at the express authority of the commander in chief.\nUnlike other branches, Trump would not have to get the sign off of local authorities to act \u2014 likely making their activation a tempting option.\nFBI OUSTS FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR, AGENT INVOLVED IN J6 PROSECUTIONS, WITH MORE EXPECTED\nWhen speaking to reporters in the Oval Office last week, Trump railed against what he described as a \"ridiculous\" level of crime in the nation's capital, buffeted most recently by the assault on a former DOGE staffer earlier this month.\n\"We want to have a great, safe capital,\" Trump said last week. \"And we\u2019re going to have it.\"\nTrump also told reporters that his White House lawyers are looking into ending the Home Rule Act, a law passed by Congress in 1973 that gave Washington, D.C., residents the right to elect their own mayor and local representatives.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also told reporters last week that Trump had ordered law enforcement personnel to increase their presence in the capital, though the additional details on the scope and timeframe of that presence remain unclear.\nTrump is expected to address those plans in a press conference Monday morning.\nHowever, for Trump, delivering on this promise could be fraught with long-term legal complications \u2014 in part, because crime in the city is actually down to its lowest point in nearly 30 years.\nFEDERAL JUDGES GRILL TRUMP LAWYERS OVER 'LIBERATION DAY' TARIFFS ON EVE OF ENFORCEMENT\nViolent crime in the first seven months of 2025 has dropped by roughly 26% compared to 2024, according to data compiled by the D.C. Police Department and released earlier this month. Overall, crime in the nation\u2019s capital has dropped by roughly 7%.\nOn Sunday, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said in an interview with NewsNation that Washington, D.C., \"is more violent than Baghdad.\"\nWashington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser, for her part, told MSNBC in an interview Sunday that \"Any comparison to a war-torn country is hyperbolic and false.\"\nHowever, it's not the first time Trump has sought to crack down on crime in the nation's capital \u2014 an effort he has returned to frequently, including during his first term in office.\nTrump in March signed an executive order, \"Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force,\" designed to address issues with a city he has long derided as \"filthy,\" \"horribly run\" and \"crime-ridden,\" among other things. \"We want to have a great, safe capital,\" he told reporters. \"And we\u2019re going to have it. And that includes cleanliness and it includes other things.\"\nHowever, those powers aren't indefinite, experts explained to Fox News Digital.\nTrump does have the authority to activate the 2,700-member D.C. National Guard without the approval of local officials. Guard troops provide \"mission-ready personnel and units for active duty in the armed services\" in Washington, D.C., according to their website.\nBeyond that, Trump's ability to exercise authority in the nation's capital is bound by the Home Rule Act.\nIn the more than 50 years since that law was passed, \"there really hasn't been a serious conversation about ending home rule governance,\" George Derek Musgrove, a history professor at the University of Maryland in Baltimore County, told Fox News in an interview.\n\"And the problem with our federal system is that there are places where Trump really doesn't have any supporters, and therefore, with the limits of executive power, really doesn't have that much sway,\" Musgrove said. \"And he's constantly probing for ways around that.\"\nOther options available to Trump aren't without their own limits. In order to call up the local police force for any meaningful length of time, as Trump has suggested, a president must be able to assert \"special conditions of an emergency nature,\" according to the 1970s law.\n\"If D.C. doesn\u2019t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take federal control,\" Trump said last week.\nHowever, that's easier said than done, individuals familiar with the law told Fox News Digital.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"DC is just a tempting target because there's not even a lot of legal gymnastics you have to do in order to exert tremendous power [in a city with ]a 90% Democratic jurisdiction. He has it already,\" Musgrove said.\n\"But it is morally questionable, I think, and violates democratic principles,\" he added."

      "text": "Key facts about President Donald Trump: What to know\nDonald Trump served as the 45th President of the United States and was re-elected in 2024 to become the 47th President. He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022. Trump married Marla Maples in 1993, and they have one daughter, Tiffany Trump.\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest child of President Trump, has five children: Kai Trump, Donald J. Trump III, Tristan Trump, Spencer Trump, and Chloe Trump. Eric Trump is married to Lara Trump, who currently hosts FOX News Channel's \"My View with Lara Trump.\" Eric and Lara have two children, Eric Luke Trump and Carolina Trump. Ivanka Trump is married to Jared Kushner, and they have three children: Arabella Kushner, Joseph Kushner, and Theodore Kushner. Tiffany Trump welcomed her first child, Alexander Boulos, in 2025 with her husband, Michael Boulos."

      "text": "The FBI on Thursday is ousting at least three officials, including the former acting director and an officer involved in the January 6 investigations, Fox News has learned.\nFormer FBI acting director, Brian Driscoll, is among those being forced out of the bureau, sources familiar with the matter told Fox News, along with Walter Giardina, a special agent at the bureau who played a role in the investigation of Trump trade advisor, Peter Navarro, and Steven Jensen, the acting director in charge of the Washington Field Office.\nDriscoll, for his part, served as acting director of the FBI prior to the confirmation of FBI Director Kash Patel, and Jensen played a key role in the January 6 investigations.\nSenior FBI officials told the agents in question that they needed to leave by Friday, with no specific reason given to them individually.\nFBI AGENTS GROUP TELLS CONGRESS TO TAKE URGENT ACTION TO PROTECT AGAINST POLITICIZATION\nOne individual with knowledge of the removals described it as \"retribution.\"\nIndividuals familiar with the matter told Fox News that more ousters are expected at the bureau by the end of the week, though the exact number of personnel included, or their roles at the bureau, are unclear.\nU.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro refused to answer several questions from Fox News about the FBI ousters during a press conference Thursday morning.\nStill, news of their removals comes months after thousands of FBI personnel in February were forced to fill out a sprawling questionnaire asking employees detailed questions about any role they may have played in the investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riots \u2014 ranging from whether they had testified in any criminal trials to when they last participated in investigation-related activity.\nThe questionnaire, first reported by Fox News Digital, sparked urgent fears about politicization within the bureau, and concern that it could be used to retaliate against agents involved in the January 6 investigations.\nThose concerns reached a fever pitch later that month, after then-Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordered the bureau to compile a list of all current and former personnel who worked on investigations related to January 6, 2021, riots case.\nThat information included details on \"thousands\" of employees, including their unique identifying number, their current title and their role and title at the time of the investigation.\nA group of nine current FBI agents and employees in U.S. District Court later filed a lawsuit over the list, citing fears that it could threaten their careers and risks disrupting the bureau's essential work.\nFormer Justice Department officials have cited concerns that the probe or any retaliatory measures carried out as a result could have a chilling effect on the work of the FBI, including its more than 52 separate field offices.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents Association (FBIAA), a voluntary professional association that represents more than 14,000 active and retired FBI special agents, told Fox News in a statement on Thursday that they are \"deeply concerned\" about the reported oustings and said they are \"actively reviewing all legal options\" to defend FBI agents who were summarily fired from the bureau without cause or process.\n'CORRUPT' FBI MUST BECOME 'PRISTINE,' TRUMP SAYS, ASSERTING PATEL WILL 'STRAIGHTEN IT OUT'\nThe FBIAA is \"deeply concerned by reports that FBI Special Agents\u2014case agents and senior leaders alike\u2014are going to be summarily fired without due process for doing their jobs investigating potential federal crimes,\" the group said in a statement.\n\"Agents are not given the option to pick and choose their cases, and these agents carried out their assignments with professionalism and integrity. Most importantly, they followed the law,\" the FBIAA said.\nFormer FBI and Department of Justice officials previously warned in interviews with Fox News Digital that such firings, while within Trump's authority, could have a chilling effect on the rest of the bureau should the administration move to get rid of the personnel involved in the Jan. 6 investigations.\nThe Trump administration has not yet said whether it will move to take action against the individuals involved.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIn February, President Donald Trump declined to answer questions over whether his administration would remove FBI employees involved in the investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, telling reporters only that he believes the bureau is \"corrupt\" and that then-FBI director nominee, Kash Patel, would \"straighten it out.\"\nThe FBI did not respond to Fox News' request for comment."
