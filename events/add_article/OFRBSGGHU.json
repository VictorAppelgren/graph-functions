      "summary": "On September 3, Ukraine suffered casualties from a Russian air strike that launched 526 projectiles, while the Ukrainian Air Force intercepted 430 drones and 21 missiles. President Zelenskyy condemned the attack as a display of Russian impunity and vowed a layered defense. Russian President Putin offered a face‑to‑face meeting in Moscow, which Kyiv rejected, insisting no real peace intent. Concurrently, Russian fuel shortages from drone strikes on refineries have driven domestic gasoline prices up 54% and forced export bans, while India’s growing imports of Russian crude have helped stabilize global markets.",
