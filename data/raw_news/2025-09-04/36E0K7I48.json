  "content": "We have a pretty tricky Pips puzzle on our hands today. Even the Medium tier gave me a bit of difficulty as I started it out wrong and had to clear the board and try again. The Difficult tier is daunting in shape and size. Let\u2019s dive right in!\n\nLooking for Wednesday\u2019s Pips? Read our guide right here.\n\nIn Pips, you have a grid of multicolored boxes. Each colored area represents a different \u201ccondition\u201d that you have to achieve. You have a select number of dominoes that you have to spend filling in the grid. You must use every domino and achieve every condition properly to win. There are Easy, Medium and Difficult tiers.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of a difficult tier Pips:\n\nAs you can see, the grid has a bunch of symbols and numbers with each color. On the far left, the three purple squares must not equal one another (hence the equal sign crossed out). The two pink squares next to that must equal a total of 0. The zig-zagging blue squares all must equal one another. You click on dominoes to rotate them, and will need to since they have to be rotated to fit where they belong.\n\nNot shown on this grid are other conditions, such as \u201cless than\u201d or \u201cgreater than.\u201d If there are multiple tiles with > or < signs, the total of those tiles must be greater or less than the listed number. It varies by grid. Blank spaces can have anything. The various possible conditions are:\n\u2022 = All pips must equal one another in this group.\n\u2022 \u2260 All pips must not equal one another in this group.\n\u2022 > The pip in this tile (or tiles) must be greater than the listed number.\n\u2022 < The pip in this tile must be less than the listed number.\n\u2022 An exact number (like 6) The pip must equal this exact number.\n\u2022 Tiles with no conditions can be anything.\n\nIn order to win, you have to use up all your dominoes by filling in all the squares, making sure to fit each condition. Play today\u2019s Pips puzzle here.\n\nBelow are the solutions for the Easy and Medium tier Pips. After that, I\u2019ll walk you through the Difficult puzzle. Spoilers ahead.\n\nLet\u2019s do a complete walkthrough of today\u2019s Difficult Pips. It starts out like this:\n\nAs daunting as this Pips looks, it actually gives us a very solid path and a clear starting point. Since the bottom Dark Blue 18 group can only be solved with three 6\u2019s, we\u2019ll start there. I placed the double 6 domino first, then the 6/0 domino inot the Orange 0 group, since those five Orange tiles all have to be blanks. I plopped the double blank domino in next, since it\u2019s the only one that fits, like so:\n\nNext up, we have a Blue = group of five tiles and a Pink = group of three tiles. Now it\u2019s mostly a matter of checking how many dominoes you have with how many pips on each side. We have a lot of 5\u2019s and 3\u2019s. We have a lot of a lot of things, but only 5\u2019s were enough to fulfill the Blue = group condition.\n\nWe also have a limited number of blank pip dominoes, which led me to believe the Pink = group must have 4\u2019s. So I placed the 0/5 domino into Orange and Blue, and the 0/4 domino into Orange and Pink. Then I used the 5/5 domino to continue filling in the Blue group, and the 4/5 in Pink/Blue right above.\n\nWe only have one more Pink tile and one more Blue tile at this point, and both are adjacent to a Purple 2 group. So I placed the 4/1 domino into Pink/Purple and the 5/1 group into Blue/Purple, like so:\n\nAt this point, half the board and change is done, and I\u2019m pretty sure that everything is kosher so far. I can\u2019t think of any other way these tiles could be filled.\n\nIt\u2019s still not super clear what goes where, but there\u2019s one big clue: The Green 6 tile has to have a 6 pip domino and the Blue 2 has to have two 1 pip dominoes since there aren\u2019t any blanks remaining. So I placed the 6/2 domino into Green/Dark Blue and the 2/1 domino into Dark Blue/Blue. With those filled in, the only way to finish up the Orange = group was our final double domino (3/3). The final 1 pip had to go in Blue so I placed it there, with the 3 spilling over into Purple \u2260.\n\nFinally, the 5/2 domino went into Purple \u2260 / Pink = and the 2/3 went right next to that, like so:\n\nToday\u2019s Pips had the most varying conditions of any we\u2019ve seen in a long time. Ironically, in some ways this makes it easier even though it looks like it would be more challenging. Very specific conditions take away some of the vagueness of less complicated puzzles. Identifying those is crucial to a smooth solution. How did you do today?\n\nBe sure to follow me for all your daily puzzle-solving guides, TV show and movie reviews and more here on this blog!",

      "text": "It\u2019s Thor\u2019s Day. The first week of September is flying by. The latest NYT Games puzzle is keeping many of us occupied, as we figure out how to fit dominoes on a grid of colorful tiles. It\u2019s a fun little challenge that\u2019s made for a nice change of pace from my usual word puzzles. Let\u2019s solve today\u2019s, shall we?\nLooking for Wednesday\u2019s Pips?

Spoilers ahead.\nEasy\nMedium\nDifficult\nLet\u2019s do a complete walkthrough of today\u2019s Difficult Pips. It starts out like this:\nA bit of a tricky Pips today, as it\u2019s not entirely clear how to start. We have several Total groups, a couple = groups and just one > tile, that really could be a few different things. I decided I\u2019d use the Purple 24 group as my anchor point. With no 6 pips dominoes, my best guess was this would need four 5 pip tiles and one 4 pip tile to complete. I decided to place the 2/5 domino in the Pink > tile, over into the Purple 24 Group.\nBased on the number of 3 and 4 pips dominoes, I figured the Dark Blue = group would be 3\u2019s and the Green = Group would be 4\u2019s. There were extras of each, but more 4\u2019s than 3\u2019s. I used the extra 4 in the 0/4 domino to place in the Blue 0 tile, down into the Purple 4 group. Then I placed the 1/5 domino in Orange 4 / Purple 24 and the 3/5 domino in the Dark Blue = / Purple 24, like so:\nThis felt like a pretty solid foundation. One entire corner was filled in and I had a good sense of where I wanted to go from here. I stuck the 2/4 domino into Orange 4 / Green = and then the 3/4 domino into Dark Blue = / Green = and finally, rounded out the Orange 4 with the 1/0 domino into Purple 0, like so:\nI had just three dominoes left, so unless I\u2019d screwed up badly I knew I was about to wrap this one up. I placed the 0/5 domino into the open tile down into Purple 24, finishing that group. The 1/4 domino went into the open tile / Green = and wrapped that group up. Finally, the 0/3 domino went into Purple 0 and the last open tile and that, ladies and gentlemen, was that.\nThis one took a bit to get started as there were no super obvious ways to begin, but with a little deduction and domino counting, I got off to a good start and was able to knock this out pretty quickly.

      "text": "The final weekend of Advent is here, with Christmas Eve jingling its way to us this Sunday and Old Saint Nick squeezing down our chimneys in time for Christmas morning.\nIt\u2019s the first very wintry weekend in these parts also, with a rainy morning gone chilly, transforming into a very wet snowfall just in time for Yuletide.\nWhat better way to spend such a cold, grey, festive weekend than kicking back in the cozy warmth of your home and streaming some new shows and movies? There\u2019s both new content and some recent theatrical releases that have made their way to streaming this weekend. Let\u2019s dive right in . . . .\nRebel Moon: Part One \u2014 A Child Of Fire (Netflix)\nZack Snyder\u2019s big Star Wars / Dune knockoff, Rebel Moon, lands on Netflix this Friday. It\u2019s getting panned by critics with a dismal 22% Rotten Tomatoes score, but fans\u2014Snyder has a passionate, vocal following\u2014are being gentler, with a 72% audience score. I\u2019ll have to watch for myself this weekend and report back. I generally enjoy some stuff about Snyder\u2019s films, while almost always walking away disappointed by the script. Also, movies should be stand-alone or trilogies or longer epics like Harry Potter, but not this two-part nonsense. A trilogy is usually comprised of three complete movies which form a three-act whole, but a two-parter (like the most recent Mission Impossible) is just one long movie with a cliffhanger. Stop it, Hollywood!\nWhat If...? (Disney+)\nMarvel\u2019s much-loved What If...? animated show returns with another season of hypothetical stories that ask the question in the title. What if Iron Man made his suit out of glass instead of iron? That sort of thing. A new episode releases Friday, Saturday and Sunday before settling into a normal weekly release cycle. I like this idea! Kind of halfway between dropping a whole season and releasing weekly.\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians (Disney+)\nI\u2019ve actually (weirdly) never read the Percy Jackson books despite being an avid YA reader, and I didn\u2019t see the movies, either. But I watched the first two episodes of Percy Jackson and the Olympians on Disney+ and really enjoyed it! (Here\u2019s my review). It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s a charming, family-friendly fantasy series that I have high hopes for. I think the first two episodes were still finding their feet, and I\u2019m excited to see where the show takes us when our heroes set out on their quest.\nSouth Park: Not Suitable For Children (Paramount+)\nSouth Park is back with yet another extended special, Not Suitable For Children. This time around Matt Stone and Trey Parker tackle OnlyFans and online adult influencers in an episode that, well, is not suitable for children! I really enjoyed their last special, Joining The Panderverse, and can\u2019t wait to watch this one!\nThe Creator (Disney+)\nThe Creator is finally out on streaming which I\u2019m very excited about since I missed it in theaters. I kept meaning to go and I kept putting it off and then it was gone and I was sad. Now it\u2019s here! By all accounts it\u2019s a much better, more powerful science-fiction movie than Rebel Moon, too. John David Washington stars in the film, which is about a future war between humankind and AI and one man\u2019s surprising change of heart.\nBeaue Is Afraid (Paramount+)\nI\u2019ve been waiting for the weird A24 Joaquin Phoenix-led Beau Is Afraid to hit streaming and now it\u2019s finally out on Paramount+ / Showtime. It\u2019s sort of a horror movie, I guess. More theater of the absurd by the looks of it. But director Ari Aster has scared us before with such grim films as Midsommar and Hereditary.\nSaltburn (Amazon Prime Video)\nAnother very, very weird-looking film, Saltburn only recently left theaters (and might actually still be in some). A story of debauchery, decadence and wealth that follows an Oxford student who invites another student to his family estate for the summer. This was written and directed by Emerald Fennel and has quite a cast, including Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi and Rosamund Pike, who I\u2019ve only seen in The Wheel Of Time in recent years. Margot Robbie co-produces. It looks . . . very strange!\nSlow Horses (Apple TV)\nWe\u2019re now in the back half of our little weekend streaming guide. These are three of the shows I\u2019m currently watching with weekly episodic releases on their respective streaming platforms.\nSlow Horses is once again a top-tier spy thriller-comedy and Gary Oldman is at his rather disgusting best once again. My only complaint about the Apple TV series is how short each season is. I\u2019m sorry, but six episodes per season is simply not enough and I feel (once again) that we\u2019re being sold a little short. And this season is really good! I don\u2019t want it to end in just one more episode!\nFargo (Hulu)\nI\u2019m really loving Season 5 of Fargo. The blend of Minnesota midwest crime, The Wizard Of Oz and The Nightmare Before Christmas (with just a spoonful of Home Alone) really makes for a wild ride. I just think the political commentary is too heavy-handed and on-the-nose. Other than that, it\u2019s great!\nReacher (Amazon Prime Video)\nI need to write a review of Season 2 of Amazon\u2019s Reacher, based on the thriller novels by Lee Child. I liked Season 1 . . . a lot more. This one feels off, with more plot holes, less chemistry between actors and other issues that are harder to pin down. I think Alan Ritchson is perfect for the role, but did he need to bulk up even more? Reacher isn\u2019t gym-bulky in the books. And there was a certain seen with a tossed barbeque that just really made no sense. It\u2019s still fun, but, eh. Not as good. And if I hear \u201cnobody messes with the Special Investigations Unit\u201d one more time . . . But gripes aside, it\u2019s still good brainless fun, kind of like the novels.\nWhat are you watching this weekend? Any Christmas recommendations? Let me know on Twitter or Facebook."
