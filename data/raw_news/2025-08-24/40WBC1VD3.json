  "content": "Cutdown day is coming Tuesday for the Giants, which could spell the end of Tommy DeVito\u2019s time playing for his hometown team.\n\nThe Giants\u2019 No. 4 quarterback at least put forth a strong performance in the preseason finale Thursday against the Patriots, completing 17 of 20 passes for 198 yards with three touchdowns and zero interceptions.\n\nThe New Jersey product made eight starts (3-5) over the previous two seasons with the Giants, but the team signed veteran quarterbacks Russell Wilson and Jameis Winston in the offseason and spent a first-round draft pick on Jaxson Dart.\n\n\u201cI think you go back the past couple of years, from his rookie year \u2026 and then last year playing a couple of games, and even everything he did through this preseason, I think there\u2019s plenty of tape out there that shows he can play in this league,\u201d receiver Wan\u2019Dale Robinson said of DeVito after practice. \u201cHe\u2019s just grown since he got here. I remember when he first got here, it was like this dude doesn\u2019t know anything going on with this offense, he\u2019s really quiet.\n\n\u201cBut now he\u2019s probably the most experienced one in that quarterback room with knowing the offense. He\u2019s just grown up a lot. I\u2019m excited for Tommy with all the opportunities he gets and I hope everything works out for him.\u201d\n\nThe Giants released veteran safety K\u2019Von Wallace and placed cornerback T.J. Moore on injured reserve.\n\nMoore was at the team facility Sunday after undergoing surgery on his fractured leg.\n\n\u201cHe was just here a little while ago. Good spirits, but tough injury for him,\u201d Giants coach Brian Daboll said before practice.\n\nTight end Theo Johnson and offensive lineman Josh Ezeudu were among those who did not practice Sunday.\n\nTight end Jermaine Terry and safety Raheem Layne worked on the side with trainers.",

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21. Terms Pertaining to Certain Third Party Content, Data and Information Providers and Mobile Application Platforms.\n21.1 AP Material. By accessing the Services, you specifically acknowledge and agree that (i) Associated Press text, photo, graphic, video and/or audio material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium; (ii) No Associated Press materials nor any portion thereof may be stored in a computer except for personal and non-commercial use; (iii) The Associated Press will not be held liable for any delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions therefrom or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part thereof or for any damages arising from any of the foregoing; (iv) The Associated Press is an intended third party beneficiary of these terms and conditions and it may exercise all rights and remedies available to it; and (v) The Associated Press reserves the right to audit possible unauthorized commercial use of AP materials or any portion thereof at any time.\n21.2 Mobile Applications.

He ended up with three rushing attempts for 12 yards. That is not much to work with, but getting him in a game was an important step, as far as getting him ready for the real thing in a few weeks.\n\u2014 With the starters resting, the first-team offensive line was rookie left tackle Marcus Mbow, left guard Aaron Stinnie, center Austin Schlottman, right guard Evan Neal and right tackle Stone Forsythe."

      "text": "Access the Giants like never before\nGet texts from Paul Schwartz with all the latest Giants news and insights, exclusive to Sports+ subscribers.\ntRY IT NOWWan\u2019Dale Robinson is an established receiver now in the NFL, entering his fourth season with the Giants.\nWorking with the team\u2019s overhauled quarterbacks room this preseason has given Robinson optimism that the Giants offense can quickly improve a low-octane unit that ranked 30th in yards per game and 31st in scoring in 2024.\n\u201cI feel confident. I think we worked really hard this summer, doing a lot of different things and getting a lot of people involved and moving a lot of different places,\u201d Robinson said after practice Sunday in East Rutherford, N.J. \u201cI think seeing it out there in these preseason games, you kind of saw, even if it wasn\u2019t the starters, there was the standard that was set throughout camp.\u201d\nThe Giants averaged 35.7 points per game in their three preseason wins, even if imported starter Russell Wilson attempted only 14 passes (with 10 completions) in two appearances before sitting out Thursday\u2019s 42-10 win over New England.\n\u201cJust his attention to deal with everything,\u201d Robinson said when asked what he\u2019s learned most about Wilson during training camp. \u201cWhenever it comes to routes, he wants to know that you\u2019re gonna be in certain spots and he\u2019s gonna let you know exactly what he needs out of you, which is definitely something I\u2019ve felt like we needed as a whole team.\n\u201cSo I\u2019m always trying to make sure I\u2019m doing the right thing, running to the ball, but it\u2019s just like I said, the attention to detail, just the \u2018want to be great\u2019 is exactly what you get out of him.\u201d\nThe 10-time Pro Bowler will start Week 1 against the Commanders on Sept. 7 and beyond, but if the 36-year-old Wilson falters, the Giants have impressive first-round pick Jaxson Dart and veteran signal caller Jameis Winston behind him.\nDart, the 25th pick in the draft, completed 32 of 47 passes for 372 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions \u2014 plus a rushing score \u2014 in the preseason.\n\u201cHe\u2019s got some moxie to him. I\u2019m just really excited to watch him go out there and play,\u201d said Robinson, who registered a career-high 93 receptions last season. \u201cIt looked like he was all in command and knew exactly where he needed to go with the ball.\n\u201cA couple of receivers we were talking to were like, this is going to be a pretty good quarterback once he knows exactly all the checks and everything going on. It\u2019s going to be really exciting for him.\u201d\nGiants coach Brian Daboll still hasn\u2019t declared whether Dart or Winston will serve as the No. 2 quarterback behind Wilson for Week 1, saying only \u201cwe\u2019ll see\u201d and referring to the rookie as \u201ca backup quarterback\u201d before the start of Sunday\u2019s practice.\n\u201cRuss had a lot of reps, by far and away, the most reps of practice,\u201d Daboll said of camp. \u201cYou script practice for things you want to see, for all the quarterbacks, but for your team most importantly. I think [offensive coordinator] Mike [Kafka] did a really good job with that.\u201d\nRobinson \u2014 part of a returning receiving corps also featuring Malik Nabers and Darius Slayton \u2014 liked the feeling of walking off the field following productive showings by the offense.\n\u201cIt won\u2019t take some getting used to, we\u2019ll be happy for it, but we came in the locker room after each game and were like, this is what we want,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cWe want to come in here happy, scoring 30 points, with the wins. \u2026 I think [that\u2019s possible]. At the end of the day, we still gotta go out there and prove it, and go out there and put points on the board.\n\u201cSo we\u2019re definitely excited to get going, just trying to take each day one at a time and continue to get better. Then whenever game week comes and Sunday comes, we\u2019ll be ready to kick off and ready to go.\u201d"

      "text": "If Thursday was the end of one of the unlikeliest chapters in Giants\u2019 history, Tommy DeVito made it a memorable goodbye to his paisans.\nGreeted warmly at the start of the second half by many of the same fans who once stood in meet-and-greet lines around the corner to pay about $200 for his autograph, the fourth-stringer DeVito completed 15 of his first 17 passes and threw three touchdowns in leading the Giants\u2019 practice-squad hopefuls through the end of a 42-10 preseason victory against the Patriots.\n\u201cIt means a lot,\u201d the North Jersey product said. \u201cThe ovation. Stuff from Jersey. If I was in the stands, I\u2019d be cheering for anybody who was the hometown kid, too. It felt good getting two whole quarters to play and feel the energy, excitement, and love for the game again.\u201d\nOnce an undrafted rookie who impressed Giants coaches at a pre-draft local tryout, DeVito became one of the most viral players in the NFL during the 2023 season after he surprisingly beat the Packers in prime time for his third straight win, talked openly about living with his parents so that he could feast on his mother\u2019s homemade chicken cutlets, and celebrated touchdown passes with a pinched-fingers homage to his Italian heritage."

  "argos_summary": "The Giants are heading into a cutdown day that could end Tommy DeVito\u2019s tenure with the hometown team after a strong preseason performance against the Patriots. With veteran quarterbacks Russell Wilson and Jameis Winston signed and rookie Jaxson Dart drafted, the Giants\u2019 quarterback room is crowded, and DeVito\u2019s future is uncertain. The team also released safety K\u2019Von Wallace, placed cornerback T.J. Moore on injured reserve, and saw other players miss practice due to injuries. Despite the roster shake\u2011ups, the Giants remain hopeful that their new quarterback depth and offensive improvements will help them compete in the upcoming season.",
