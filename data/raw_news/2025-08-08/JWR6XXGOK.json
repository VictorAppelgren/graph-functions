  "description": "Inside the exclusive Seychelles resort where both British and Hollywood royalty have reportedly stayed.",
  "content": "Nicolas Louys steps inside the primary suite of an 8,000-square-foot villa in the Seychelles and immediately points to the bed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m led to believe that we have the biggest mattress in the Indian Ocean. And there\u2019s a story behind it,\u201d he says with a laugh.\n\nLouys is the deputy general manager at North Island, one of the country\u2019s most exclusive resorts. As he looks at the bed, which is more than twice the size of a king mattress, he recalls how an extremely tall guest visited years back and found the existing king-size mattress to be a bit small.\n\n\u201cOn his second visit, we personalized his mattress without letting him know and surprised him. And it\u2019s been this size [ever since],\u201d he explains, adding that they change the mattress every five years.\n\nLouys was asked multiple times if this visitor was a professional basketball player. But despite repeated attempts over the course of two days to get him to reveal a name, he doesn\u2019t budge. He responds with mischievous smiles and laughter instead, dodging each question with charm. The island\u2019s non-disclosure agreements bind him to protect guests\u2019 privacy \u2013 which is one of the island\u2019s most appealing qualities.\n\nNorth Island is a luxury resort that aims to find a balance between opulence and the great outdoors. It\u2019s located about 15 minutes away from the Seychelles\u2019 main island by helicopter, which is the preferred mode of transport for guests. The private island has just 11 villas. Ten are nearly 5,000 square feet, but Villa 11 is almost twice as big.\n\nDespite the size, Villa 11, which is also known as Villa North, is meant for two guests. It has only one bedroom, along with a study, private kitchen, plunge pool and multiple outdoor seating areas. Prices for this villa start at 13,000 euros, or approximately $15,000, a night, according to Louys.\n\nEach of the island\u2019s villas come equipped with an iPad and iPhone, which guests can use to call their personal butler for requests both big and small, day or night.\n\n\u201cWe say, \u2018any venues, any menus, anytime.\u2019 I\u2019ve had guests wake up at four o\u2019clock in the morning and they want have their breakfast. They want to stick with their time zone from back home. So we accommodate it,\u201d Louys says. \u201cIf you\u2019re paying that price tag to come to this environment, you expect to\u2026 have that service that you experience back home.\u201d\n\nGiven the island\u2019s price point, Louys says that many guests are usually either well-known public figures or business executives who are accustomed to private chefs and butlers. Both British and Hollywood royalty have reportedly honeymooned on the North Island, and a number of celebrities have allegedly visited as well.\n\nLouys, of course, can\u2019t confirm either way.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve read a lot of reports about this kind of information. I\u2019ve read many articles of various high-profile clients being at North Island, but I\u2019m not too sure if they did or not,\u201d he says with a smile.\n\nNorth Island\u2019s hefty price tag affords guests a luxurious vacation. But it also helps fund the island\u2019s ongoing conservation work.\n\nLong before 11 villas dotted North Island\u2019s beaches, a Seychellois family established a plantation on the island in 1826. For over 100 years, farmers grew a variety of crops and raised livestock. Along with the plants and animals that were purposely imported, invasive species accidentally arrived as well. Eventually, this activity began wreaking havoc on local wildlife.\n\n\u201cThey had the brilliant idea of bringing cats over because they thought it\u2019ll kill rats that were obviously a problem for them\u2026 but actually the cats quickly jumped on the native birds,\u201d explains Mathilde Le Gressus, North Island\u2019s conservation coordinator.\n\n\u201cAnd after, they thought: okay, the cats didn\u2019t work, so we can try with an owl \u2013 the huge white European owl that we find in Europe. And they also attacked the native birds. So it was just a combination of things that made it worse and worse and worse.\u201d\n\nThroughout this period, the plantation\u2019s main crop was dried coconut, known as copra. As the copra industry began to collapse in the 1970s, the farm was abandoned, leaving domestic animals running wild. This phenomenon wasn\u2019t unique to North Island \u2013 similar stories echoed across the country.\n\nIn 1997, a South African company and private shareholders purchased North Island, intending to both revive its biodiversity and develop a luxury resort. This coincided with a national island restoration program, in which the government partnered with non-profit organizations and private islands. The coalition worked towards removing invasive species, paving the way for native plants and animals to make a comeback.\n\nNorth Island symbolically called its conservation program the Noah\u2019s Ark Project, which is fully financed by the resort\u2019s revenue. After a yearslong effort to eradicate rats, the team slowly began reintroducing endangered wildlife. Today, sea turtles nest on the shores. Aldabra Tortoises roam freely. And hundreds of birds that were once on the verge of extinction chirp away in the trees.\n\nThis symbiotic relationship between luxury tourism and conservation is a growing trend, according to Xavier Font, a professor of sustainability marketing at the University of Surrey, in the UK. There is always potential for greenwashing in this space, Professor Font explains, along with concerns such as carbon emissions from flights and displacing local communities. But he\u2019s quick to point out the many ways in which high-end properties can benefit the environment if managed correctly.\n\n\u201cWe can always look at this and be critical, but what could happen to some of those locations had they not been managed in this way?\u201d Font says. \u201cWould it be better if there was no tourism at all? Or would it be better if there was another type of tourism, maybe more volume of tourism?\u201d\n\nBack at Villa 11, Louys points out handmade glassware from the Netherlands that decorates the room. He highlights the Herm\u00e8s toiletries. And at the foot of the bed, he presses a button hidden on what appears to be an upholstered storage bench, giving rise to flatscreen TV.\n\nEach villa comes equipped with a personal golf cart, and the following day, Louys hops in his own. He\u2019s searching for the island\u2019s local celebrity, an Aldabra Tortoise named Brutus.\n\nIn 2003, the Noah\u2019s Ark Project brought 15 of these giant tortoises to join the few that survived North Island\u2019s plantation. About 170 roam the island today. Most tend to stay in a particular spot, but Louys explains that Brutus likes to wander everywhere. Because of his adventurous spirit, he\u2019s had a few accidental run-ins with golf carts and now wears small white reflectors on his shell so drivers can see him at night.\n\nThese reptiles can live for well over a century. Louys says Brutus is at least 150, meaning he\u2019s witnessed both the island\u2019s farm and restoration. He\u2019s also met many of the island\u2019s well-known guests over the years. And given Louys\u2019 professionalism and commitment to privacy, curious visitors have a better chance of getting Brutus to spill the beans than anyone else.\n\n\u201cHe has seen all of the famous and non-famous [people] that have stayed with us,\u201d Louys says with a chuckle as he pats the tortoise\u2019s head. \u201cAnd if you manage to convince him, he will tell you all the stories.\u201d",

      "text": "Professor Xavier Font\nAbout\nBiography\nI research and consult on topics related to sustainable tourism production and consumption. In the past I published widely about sustainable tourism certification, and more recently I've broadened to research on sustainability marketing and communication, and the use of sustainability evidence to inform policy.\nI am currently leading on a project seeking to transform tourism industry's emissions measurement and carbon trading with crypto-based systems. Partnering with Therme Group, a global organisation focused on urban wellbeing destinations, a team of researchers from Surrey's Institute for Sustainability, the Academy of Blockchain and Metaverse Applications, and the Centre for Sustainability and Wellbeing in the Visitor Economy are working to develop new digital platforms that significantly enhance the tourism industry's ability to measure and reduce its carbon footprint.\nI serve as advisor in the Travalyst coalition of Amadeus, Booking, Google, Expedia, Skyscanner, Travelport, Trip, TripAdvisor and Visa, where I use my research experience to inform efforts to align sustainability frameworks for the supply chain of the tourism industry, that can be persuasively communicated to nudge consumers.\nI have conducted over 200 courses for more than 5,000 businesses on how to market and communicate sustainability. Recently, I was the Principal Investigator for the University of Surrey for the \u20ac24.5 million Interreg project Experience to develop low season sustainable tourism visitor experiences.\nA substantial part of my time is spent in PhD supervision: I currently supervise 10 students, I've already supervised 20 to completion, and examined over 25.\nAt present, I am the Editor in Chief of the Journal of Sustainable Tourism.\nNews\nIn the media\nResearchResearch projects\nUsing sustainability evidence to inform tourism policiesTourism stakeholders have collected data on the (un)sustainability of their industry that is incomplete and lacks comparability, and what evidence exists does not inform policy. A team based at the Centre for Sustainability and Wellbeing in the Visitor Economy (SWELL) has invested over 15 years in the development of methodologies to gather sustainability evidence and to engage stakeholders in the use of such evidence. Concerns about the lack of data on the environmental and social impacts of tourism available to policymakers led the European Commission to contact Prof Graham Miller (2001-2022) to develop the European Tourism Indicator System (ETIS) in 2003-2006. The evaluation of the limited impact of ETIS (see Font et al., 2021) led to SWELL to further engage with the European Commission to re-evaluate the assumptions behind evidence-based policymaking informing sustainability dashboards, and SWELL engaging with other policymakers to experiment on the design, use and evaluation of sustainability evidence to inform tourism policy. - The European Commission contracted Prof Font's team to analyse the state of the art in the use of sustainable tourism indicators and certification programmes, resulting in a white paper from the Commission.\n- The European Commission contracted Prof Font to conduct the stakeholder participatory activities and data gathering for the 2020 European Tourism Convention, which informed the European Agenda for Tourism 2050 during the covid period. This has now resulted in the article by Guix & Font (2022) and was instrumental for 3) below.\n- The European Commission contracted Prof Font to conduct the stakeholder consultation for the sustainability elements of the Tourism Transition Pathway, the most significant European-wide policy to identify the key policy pathways towards a sustainable tourism ecosystem across the EU. The policy is now informing all tourism-related funding across the EU. The article reflecting on this research will be submitted in 2023.\n- 23 Europeans cities and 5 small consultancy companies and NGOs are engaging with the team led by Dr Alector Ribeiro to experiment with citizen democratic participation processes in tourism policy. Dr Ribeiro has published over 40 journal articles on tourism sentiment analysis amongst residents, that informed this collaboration (see Woosnam & Ribeiro, 2022).\n- We haven conducted experiments on how to develop and present sustainability data cost-benefit analysis (revenue vs carbon footprint or resident sentiment) to policymakers, resulting from Dr Torres-Delgado's Marie Curie Fellowship at Surrey (2021-23) and Font et al. (2021), which is being used by Green Destinations, a global NGO supporting more than 150 destinations across the world to gather sustainable tourism data, to change how they collect and display data to policymakers.\n- SWELL is testing methodologies to better evaluate the impact that policy interventions promoting pro-sustainability behaviour change achieve. We have adapted methods developed in the School of Sociology around complexity science to better understand the barriers and opportunities to generate change. We applied these to evaluate an Interreg EUR24m project to reduce tourism seasonality, and a five-year project from the province of Barcelona to engage small firms to act more sustainably and testing the development of sustainability-oriented innovations in the city of Barcelona.\nFounded by Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex, Travalyst is a coalition of some of the biggest names in travel. Our mission is to make the travel industry more sustainable. We do this by convening leading industry players in a pre-competitive coalition to collaborate on bringing consistent sustainability information to the mainstream for the first time. This means we can empower consumers to make better choices: for themselves, and for the planet. My role in Travalyst is as a member of the Independent Advisory Group, using my research expertise in sustainable tourism marketing and certification, to inform efforts to align sustainability frameworks on accommodation and transport.\nThis project contributed to realise the potential of common natural and cultural assets to deliver innovative and sustainable growth in the French-English Channel (FCE) region. With a budget over \u20ac24.5m, to our knowledge, this is the largest sustainable tourism project ever funded by the European Commission, and it provided an excellent platform for experimentation and data collection. The project contributed to reduce seasonality in the Oct-March period by supporting the development of experiential, sustainable tourism offer that improves the economy, contributes to healthy communities and preserves the environment. To break the cycle and successfully extend the season, EXPERIENCE developed a new tourism strategy to tackle all the challenges at once. We capitalised on successes with experiential tourism observed in other countries. We applied this to the FCE region to attract off-season visitors. The new strategy was composed of 5 delivery plans designed to break existing tourism convention and bring global innovation in season extension to our region. We:\n- United and trained traditional (tourism offices) and atypical actors (foresters/artisans) to recognise unique regional tourism selling points\n- Created new off-season tourism offer, harnessing regional selling points to create exciting itineraries\n- Adapted regional summer tourism infrastructure for off-season use\n- Promoted the FCE region for experiential tourism Oct-Mar\n- Ensured offer is demand-driven for continued off-season visitors growth in FCE region\nThis project run from 2019 to 2023 and is now completed.\nAnimal welfare in the travel industryWe are analysing the animal welfare policies of 50 national travel associations, from the largest outbound tourism markets in the world and the countries that receive most tourists to ride elephants, swim with dolphins and engage with tigers. We are using institutional theory to explain the relative power of these national associations to influence the practices of their members, and to interpret the quality of the policies (or lack of) towards quality control of tourist-captive animal encounters.\nThe team includes Prof Xavier Font, Dr Joe Kantenbacher, Dr Maria-Jesus Bonilla-Priego (U.Rey Juan Carlos III, Spain)\nResearch projects\n- The European Commission contracted Prof Font's team to analyse the state of the art in the use of sustainable tourism indicators and certification programmes, resulting in a white paper from the Commission.\n- The European Commission contracted Prof Font to conduct the stakeholder participatory activities and data gathering for the 2020 European Tourism Convention, which informed the European Agenda for Tourism 2050 during the covid period.

Our final year students are capable of producing outstanding pieces of work that are of relevance to daily sustainability operations. And our postgraduate students bring a wealth of international examples to the classroom that allows us to question much theory and makes us reflect on the need for culturally sensitive transfer of sustainability practices.\nSustainable development goals\nMy research interests are related to the following:\nPublications\nObjective Environmental life cycle assessment of hair care products shows that the highest environmental impact is associated with the use phase, rather than conception, production, packaging, distribution or disposal of the products themselves. To measure the water consumed in the use phase, an innovative and cost-effective methodology was developed and tested to measure the water consumed to rinse off hair care products (rinsability). Methods Over 4 months, we tested the rinsability of 10 shampoos and 10 hair conditioners applied to 148 females, split between six hair characteristics: length, volume, dryness, thickness, curliness and damage. The volunteers were received in a hair salon on 20 different occasions for about 30 min each time. A team of hairdressers was specifically trained to detect two indicators of when a product is rinsed: a visual disappearance of the product and a clean touch. The volunteers were asked to have their hair washed at home 48 h before their arrival, using a standardized shampoo to control for sebum apparition. Results According to this test, on average, 7.1 L of water are needed to rinse a shampoo and 6.3 L to rinse a hair conditioner. However, there are significant differences depending on hair types: long and abundant hair requires more water to rinse shampoos and conditioners, whereas hair thickness, curliness, dryness and damage do not significantly affect the water required. Conclusion We suggest that data on product rinsability are essential when considering the water footprint for shampoos and hair conditioners. This method could be adopted for industry-wide experimentation to assess the water footprint of products and set reduction targets.\nCertification provides a structure to manage, improve, and communicate sustainability performance. However, this systematic literature review of 93 articles shows that there has been little change in the research questions, theories, methods, and insights gained over 20 years to understand the motivations for functioning, and benefits of sustainable tourism certification. To support researchers to increase the rigor, novelty, and significance of their research, we categorize past research into three key stages of the sustainability certification journey: exploration, implementation, and outcomes, based on the Antecedents-Decisions-Outcomes framework. Disaggregating each stage of the framework into its corresponding challenges, actions, and competencies results in a 9-cell matrix that is used to analyze aspects that are well researched and identify where research gaps exist. The matrix shows that we have little understanding of the competencies needed by businesses to explore, implement, or exploit certification programs, and we know little about the processes involved in making internal changes in a business to comply with certification. This review's matrix approach helps identify directions for further research and practice. It emphasizes the need for (1) theory-driven research questions and robust methodologies to understand the implementation decisions taken by applicants, and (2) measuring the actual impacts of sustainability certifications.\nStakeholders must purposely reflect on the suitability of process models for designing tourism experience systems. Specific characteristics of these models relate to developing tourism experience systems as integral parts of wider socio-technical systems. Choices made in crafting such models need to address three reflexivity mechanisms: problem, stakeholder and method definition. We systematically evaluate application of these mechanisms in a living lab experiment, by developing evaluation episodes using the framework for evaluation in design science research. We outline (i) the development of these evaluation episodes and (ii) how executing them influenced the process and outcomes of co-crafting the process model. We highlight both the benefits of and an approach to incorporate reflexivity in developing process models for designing tourism experience systems.\nThis study inductively applies the Feedback Intervention Theory by empirically demonstrating the effectiveness of continuous, real-time eco-feedback and its interaction with motivational factors in modifying showering behavior. We conducted a covert true experiment across six tourist accommodations in Denmark, Spain, and the UK, where we deployed smart technology, in the form of a timer to provide the eco-feedback, coupled with persuasive messages. Data from over 17,500 showers showed that continuous, real-time eco-feedback reduced water runtime by 25.79% (CI = 8.24%; 39.98%). When the eco-feedback was paired with the most effective message - priming pro-environmental values and requiring a high effort to comply - water runtime was reduced by 23.55% (CI = 17.53%; 29.13%). The study's robust experimental design, and its emphasis on actual behavior measurement, highlight the potential of smart technology to facilitate resource conservation.\nWe develop a content analysis framework that uses a pattern matching technique and a priori coding of stakeholder inclusiveness and engagement, and materiality of sustainability reports. Our analysis identifies the institutional logics behind the sustainability reports of the largest 50 international hotel groups in 2014, 2018, and 2021. We find that the quantity (under 60%) of sustainability reports barely increases over the eight years, but the quality improves. While multiple logics coexist, reporting evolves from a predominant market logic towards a more stakeholder logic, which results in greater transparency and more compliance with increasingly regulated reporting requirements. A longitudinal analysis shows that materiality orientation changes first, followed by stakeholder orientation, and, finally, transparency. We exemplify the values of institutional logics to analyze the multiple and conflicting rationales for the largely subjective and ambiguous practices that shape the quality of sustainability reports.\nWe argue that governments\u2019 decisions to target certain tourist markets must consider both benefits and costs. We design a composite indicator methodology to assess economic benefits, using six classic indicators of market desirability (leadership, dynamism, seasonality, length of stay, expenditure and connectivity), which we complement with two carbon footprint indicators indicative of some of the costs incurred by the planet (CO2e per tourist night and CO2e per tourist trip). We model how target market decisions should change as the weight given to carbon costs changes from zero (current scenario) to 25% and 50% in the set of indicators used to select target markets. Adding carbon data in a cost-benefit analysis makes regional and national markets much more attractive than distant markets due to their low carbon footprints, despite shorter tourist stays or lower expenditures. Our method can inform government strategies to decarbonize while maintaining a clear market focus. \u2022Target market decisions must include data on environmental costs.\u2022A cost-benefit composite indicator can help decarbonize target market decisions.\u2022Incorporating carbon data changes target market priorities.\u2022Marketing to low-carbon, low-season, high-expenditure markets boosts sustainability.\nThis article reports on the benchmarking of organizational structure, governance and finances of accreditation in a number of industries and certification programs in tourism, as part of the research on the feasibility and desirability of a Sustainable Tourism Stewardship Council. There are a variety of governance structures widely accepted and potentially transferable to new accreditation bodies, with the biggest changes coming in the form of outsourcing the accreditation function from standard setting and compliance with ISO guides. Financial benchmarking has shown great weaknesses in the sector, over-relying on seed funding from donors and the general inability of the sector to be self-financing, which casts a shadow over the long term survival of accreditation in its present form.

In this book, tourism is seen to be both a significant contributor to global environmental change and one of the economic sectors that potentially will be most impacted by such changes.\"--Jacket. Includes bibliographical references and index.\nThis chapter considers whether certifying (small- and medium-sized) tourism businesses for sustainability will contribute to greater consumer interest and build the market for ecotourism and sustainable tourism. The chapter reviews the literature on green consumer behaviour and sustainable tourism demand and the limited works available on the market for certified sustainable tourism. It also investigates key marketing challenges (as presented in the literature) in the green and sustainability marketplaces with respect to positioning, branding, business-to-business promotion and distribution. It is concluded that, while certification may be a valid method to involve businesses in quality and sustainability oversight of their businesses, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that certification of sustainable tourism will have market benefits, and that such benefits should not be used to justify government, NGO or donor support of tourism certification.\nThis chapter reflects on the ability of PAN (Protected Area Network) Parks to deliver the expected benefits of certification to both national parks and stakeholder tourism businesses in Europe. The anticipated benefits included an improvement of the product through better management and an increased volume of business from certification branding and marketing. It is indicated that while both certified and applicant PAN parks report a range of benefits, there is an equally long list of challenges and costs that parks face both to behave in a more sustainable way and to prove this to PAN Parks for verification purposes. The chapter discusses the feasibility of providing benefits through working towards meeting the criteria and verification requirements.\nPurposeThis research considers new and unexplored explanations of why consumers continue to engage in environmentally damaging, fast fashion consumption. It explains why rational arguments alone do not prevent fast fashion consumption or encourage consumers to move toward greater adoption of sustainable fashion consumption behaviours.Design/methodology/approachThis research compared the effects of a \"neutral\" control and an \"intrasexual rivalry\" experimental condition on: (1) likelihood to buy, and (2) willingness to pay, of frequent female fast fashion shoppers (N = 184).FindingsWomen use fast fashion as a conspicuous signal to other women, although this is not necessarily why they waste fast fashion purchases. Mating motives appear to produce a significant increase in fast fashion buying behaviour with women feeling intrasexual pressure to engage in consumption, and utilising consumption themselves as a self-promotion strategy.Practical implicationsRetailers tackling wasteful fast fashion consumption can demonstrate that sustainable consumption provides a superior conspicuous signal to fast fashion consumption, instead of solely using rational messaging.Originality/valueGrounded in evolutionary psychology, this study uses three theories of intrasexual rivalry, conspicuous consumption and conspicuous waste to understand how both the volume and variety of fast fashion consumed are used as conspicuous signals in a mate attraction context.\nThis study extends current research on cross-contextual inconsistencies in pro-environmental behaviour (PEB) intentions. We compare the mechanisms influencing PEB intentions in tourism and post-visit home contexts. We find that moral obligation, moral disengagement, and perceived anonymity are consistently linked with PEB intentions in both contexts, but public self-awareness has a substantial impact on PEB intentions only during travel. While public self-awareness does not work consistently in relation to PEB intentions across tourism and home contexts, perceived anonymity has a consistently strong impact on moral disengagement and PEB intentions in both contexts. This study extends previous research on the contextual inconsistency of PEB intentions by elucidating the mechanisms by which deindividuation (anonymity and absence of public self-awareness) may limit PEB intentions through failure of moral self-regulation. This research also contributes to the literature on moral disengagement and deindividuation by demonstrating how the predictive effects of deindividuation components depend on the environment. Our findings will help practitioners and policymakers to devise effective, context-aware strategies to promote sustainable behaviours.\nThe lack of standards pertaining to wild animal welfare practices in tourism creates an opportunity to introduce soft regulations to improve public accountability and foster positive change. We developed a rating and ranking system to embed the ideologies of a non-governmental organisation to improve wild animal welfare practices, acting as institutional entrepreneurs to gain pragmatic legitimacy within tourism distribution channels. The new system aims to create change in three ways: (i) informing, (ii) ordering, (iii) surveyance and control of wild animal welfare. We candidly report on the methodological choices behind the system's design and implementation. We evaluate tourism distribution channels on four aspects, their: (i) policy and commitment statements, (ii) target setting and performance measurement, (iii) industry engagement and (iv) consumer awareness initiatives. An analysis of data from 12 international companies in 2020 and 2022 demonstrates how the system allows for shallow engagement in wild animal welfare practices, yet also offers the potential for significant improvements. We reflect on three methodological challenges: (i) quantification and commensuration during system design, (ii) the availability and credibility of data sources and (iii) the transparency of results.\nO objetivo do estudo foi identificar o comportamento respons\u00e1vel de empresas de turismo no Brasil e seus motivos para implementar tais a\u00e7\u00f5es. A pesquisa obteve 1.350 respostas de empresas de turismo pertencentes a diversos segmentos, tais como alojamento, viagens, alimenta\u00e7\u00e3o e transporte tur\u00edstico. A metodologia foi composta por coleta de dados quantitativa via internet, seguida de interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o baseada em estat\u00edstica descritiva e an\u00e1lise de clusters. Os resultados indicaram que, entre as empresas de turismo do Brasil, as medidas ambientais s\u00e3o as mais frequentemente implementadas, com destaque para aquelas voltadas para a economia de energia ou \u00e1gua. A an\u00e1lise evidenciou dois grupos distintos, respaldados pelo referencial te\u00f3rico, quando se trata das raz\u00f5es para implementar as pr\u00e1ticas respons\u00e1veis: um com foco nos neg\u00f3cios e outro com foco nos indiv\u00edduos. Enquanto o primeiro apresenta raz\u00f5es inerentes ao neg\u00f3cio, tais como redu\u00e7\u00e3o de custos e amplia\u00e7\u00e3o da competitividade; o outro grupo tem motivos ligados ao modo de vida e aos valores do indiv\u00edduo. O grupo, que tem motiva\u00e7\u00f5es centradas no indiv\u00edduo, revelou-se maior e com mais implementa\u00e7\u00f5es das medidas investigadas nos tr\u00eas pilares da sustentabilidade. Por fim, n\u00e3o houve constata\u00e7\u00e3o de diferen\u00e7as no desempenho financeiro entre empresas dos dois grupos.\nTourism statistics point towards increased tourist mobility in holiday destinations, with a subsequent rise in associated externalities, above all those related with the use of hire cars. This paper therefore suggests that a fixed-rate tax should be levied on vehicle hire in order to reduce congestion externalities and thus achieve more efficient traffic levels. With this purpose in mind, count data models were used to assess alternative ways of modelling the demand function for hire cars in Mallorca (Spain) so that the corrective potential of the proposed tax could then be analysed. Although the inelasticity that was observed might indicate a low short-run capacity to internalise costs, it also represents a high potential for raising revenue that could be used to fund alternative means of group transport. In the mid-run, this would lead to increased elasticity and, in consequence, to better internalising effectiveness.\nDrawing from the field of complex evaluations we discuss a novel application of process tracing for the evaluation of complex tourism interventions. We argue that to better evidence impact of tourism interventions and facilitate policy transfer we ought to adopt approaches to evaluation that allow us to deepen our understanding of causal mechanisms at play in an intervention. We adopt process tracing as a qualitative, theory-based evaluation method to make within-case causal inferences about impact. To showcase the method, we apply it to evaluate the outcomes of a real-world EU-Interreg sustainable tourism intervention called \"EXPERIENCE,\" implemented across six pilot regions across France and England. We argue that deepening our understanding of how interventions work in a local context is necessary for the design and transferability of future interventions across similar contexts.\nPurpose - The purpose of the study was to examine the relative importance of corporate social and environmental responsibility (CSER) in comparison to standard, price, duration, destination, brand and disruption using choice- based conjoint analysis (CBC). Design/methodology/approach - CBC was used as the data collection survey technique, and counts analysis for preference and hierarchical Bayes estimation (HB) for importance levels data analysis methods, from Sawtooth Software Inc. Findings - Results show that 2: 1 Royal Caribbean Cruise Line cruise consumers prefer companies with CSER policies and practices. However, their actual product choice selection of cruise package attributes revealed that consumers overall placed less importance on CSER when choosing cruises. Experienced consumers were more brand image- conscious than those new to cruising, and consumers who were less price- sensitive were most willing to choose companies with CSER policies and practices. Research limitations/implications - The information provided is specifically on \"what\"cruise consumer preferences and importance attributes are but does not explicitly explain \"why\"the respondents made the choices they did. This was at the time a limitation of the software used to conduct the study. Practical implications - The Conjoint Analysis CBC Sawtooth Software pre- 2014 version choice simulators do not facilitate questions that provide answers as to \"why\"respondents make the choices they do in the market simulations. Social implications - The knowledge contribution is of value to both academia and industry, as the quantitative statistical data on the cruise consumers' choice preferences are of value in understanding and identifying solutions/approaches towards \"opening the bottleneck\"that exists between private sector sustainable development practices and consumer lifestyle changes. Originality/value - This was the first time that CBC/HB was applied within academia to examine the cruise consumers' choice preferences in a UK context and also the first time that CSER was applied as a direct variable in a cruise package to determine the preference and important values of a brand in a consumer behaviour decision- making context.\nCollaborative approaches to destination design require conscious and reflexive stakeholder involvement in activities and decision making. Design science studies such participatory processes by observing design teams in practice. From these observations, scientists have identified design strategies and processes that design teams use to support their work in identifying problems and developing solutions. Observing design processes in tourism destinations provides an opportunity to identify successful co-design strategies for destination design. This study presents three key co-design strategies based on data collected from five living labs in five destinations. Each co-design strategy is presented with a recommended use, suggestions for stakeholder involvement, and activities to develop solutions efficiently and effectively with the available resources. Together, the strategies provide a framework to optimise decision-making in relation to shaping destination design processes, and to validate processes and outcomes.\nThis article introduces the ethical reasons for tourist destinations to follow marketled or supplyoriented strategies when developing tourism as an economic option. Economic, environmental and social issues will be used to exemplify the consequences of either pure strategy. The article argues that there is a need to take into account the public sector, the private sector, nonprofit organizations and the residents in order to design sustainable tourism strategies.\nThis paper outlines the consultation of recreation managers and stakeholders in forests in the United Kingdom, Portugal and Finland regarding their use of Environmental Management Systems (EMS) to plan, manage and monitor visitor impacts, The results show that there is a critical mass of sites already using the components of an EMS or capable of doing so, with some potential to fully implement an EMS. This informs the development of criteria of an EU funded feasibility study for an ecolabel for forest recreation and tourism sites.\nHybridity is the combination of different belief systems (institutional logics) that guide organ-isational practice. We analyse 32 decarbonisation business plans of tour operators to study the interplay between the market logic (incumbent) that supports the pursuit of continuous economic expansion, and the post-growth logic (challenger) that rejects the idea of unbridled growth. Through a mixed-method approach that combines content analysis and regression modelling, we find that the configurations of hybridity (i.e., the exact ways in which logics are combined) influence organisations' abilities to adopt science-based decarbonisation. We identify eight distinct transition patterns in the embedding of post-growth thinking into business plans that support a new theorisation of post-growth as a process of hybridisation.\nThis study explores the power of the story-based \u2018Most Significant Change\u2019 evaluation method to evidence the impacts of a complex sustainable tourism intervention implemented through the cross-border EU-INTERREG \u2018EXPERIENCE\u2019 project across six regions on the French-English Channel. The method provides a participatory evaluation framework to capture contextual changes by collecting and analysing personal stories of change considered significant by those directly affected. As intervention-driven changes are often unpredictable and non-linear, the method supports researchers in exploring and learning about unexpected or complex outcomes emerging from the stories. Findings highlight the effectiveness of this narrative approach in capturing complex, unforeseen changes that may not be quantifiable through pre-defined performance indicators. The study contributes to evaluating EU-funded regional development programmes in tourism. \u2022Explore the power of \u2018Most Significant Change\u2019 technique as a story-based evaluation tool.\u2022The method boosts ownership of evaluation amongst project partners.\u2022The study uncovers less-known impacts of tourism intervention on local communities.\u2022Challenges faced by small local authorities in evaluating tourism interventions.\nThis report is a policy briefing containing the main findings of the PhD project Co-Creation of Sustainability-Oriented Innovations (SOIs) in Tourism. This project was conducted in close partnership with the Barcelona City Council to co-design institutional innovations to address sustainability challenges in the city by widely engaging stakeholders in a participatory process. To enable an open participatory process, the project was nested in the Consell de Turisme i Ciutat, which gathers key public, private and civil society organizations to discuss the main tourism development issues in the city of Barcelona. The project gathers data by conducting individual interviews, and a series of stakeholder workshops to better understand the complexity of designing SOIs collectively. Amongst the main findings, this report identifies how individual and collective conceptual nuances of innovation and sustainability affect the stakeholders' ability to embark on sustainability innovations in tourism. Further, it describes collective objectives, drivers and barriers that stakeholders identified when developing SOIs. The report also offers an analysis of current tourism specific and non-tourism SOIs in Barcelona and potential ways in which these existing SOIs could be leveraged to facilitate systemic change. One of the key findings of the study is a collection of co-created SOIs by the stakeholders, which are analysed in terms of their sustainability impact and their type of innovation. These SOIs include a wide range of policy actions and interventions related to management, product development and marketing, education, incentives and monitoring and evaluation. Amongst these SOIs, during the project, the stakeholders decided to focus on expanding on four SOIs which could have a greater potential to create systemic change in the sustainable development of the city and thus in the tourism sector. These four SOIs are presented in this report as one-page business plans to facilitate its potential application. Finally, the study provides a series of recommendations to enhance collaboration and governance mechanisms to allow SOIs to thrive as collective actions that are powered by legitimacy, trust and a fair distribution of power. In this line, to empower stakeholders to utilize the findings of this project the report introduces the idea of creating a Sustainability Innovation LivingLab.\nTourism interventions, as tools for social change and preservation of natural and cultural assets are inherently complex. This study presents an improved method for the evaluation of complex tourism interventions. We argue that participatory methods can promote a culture of evaluation that supports partners throughout evidencing project impacts, eliminating negative attitudes to evaluation resulting from fear of being judged on performance. We demonstrate that Theory of Change (ToC) is an effective tool that allows organisations to actively co-create and own an evaluation strategy to ensure the delivery of project outcomes. We show how ToC can be applied as a useful process and impact evaluation tool. This paper represents a novel methodological application of ToC based on participatory approaches to evaluation to disseminate knowledge and to improve decision-making in the field of tourism interventions and tourism policy making.\nGuiding tourists in displaying civilized behavior is pivotal in destination management. This research tries to understand what forms of interpretation can effectively promote tourists' desirable behaviors. Grounded in social information processing theory, it introduces the tool of anthropomorphic interpretation cues and investigates its' efficacy in shaping tourists\u2019 civilized behavioral intentions through meaningful experience. Hypotheses are developed by integrating the social information processing theory, the three-factor theory of anthropomorphism and the narrative transportation theory, in three experiments. First, we confirm how anthropomorphic interpretation cues substantially enhance civilized behavioral intentions. Second, we show that the perception of meaningful experience mediates the effect of anthropomorphic interpretation cues in interpretive communication. Third, we show that the presence (vs. absence) of narrative within anthropomorphic interpretation cues amplifies the intervention effect. These findings offer valuable insights for destination managers, suggesting the strategic implementation of anthropomorphic cues and narrative approaches in interpretation to encourage tourists' civilized behavior. [Display omitted] \u2022This study focuses on the impact of anthropomorphic interpretation cues on tourists civilized behavioral intentions.\u2022Anthropomorphic interpretation cues can enhance tourists civilized behavioral intentions.\u2022Meaningful experience mediates the effect of anthropomorphic interpretation cues on tourists civilized behavioral intentions.\u2022Narrative strengthens the anthropomorphic interpretation cues on tourists civilized behavioral intentions.\nThe visitor economy is responsible for a substantial percentage of the global carbon footprint. The mechanisms used to decarbonize it are insufficient, and the industry is relying on carbon trading with substandard credits that allow businesses to outsource the responsibility to decarbonize. We aim to transform carbon markets, help finance climate investments, and support decarbonization strategies. We identify and define the problem, outline the components and their interactions, and develop a conceptual model to transform carbon markets. The new, blockchain-based Carbon Tokenomics Model rolls out a decentralized database to store, trade, and manage carbon credits, with the goal of enabling sustainable climate finance investment. We outline the criteria needed for an industry-wide carbon calculator. We explain the process needed to increase rigor in climate investments in the visitor economy and introduce a delegated Proof of Commitment consensus mechanism. Our inclusive and transparent model illustrates how to reduce transaction costs and how to build consumer and industry trust, generating much-needed investments for decarbonization.\nThis study inductively applies the Feedback Intervention Theory by empirically demonstrating the effectiveness of continuous, real-time eco-feedback and its interaction with motivational factors in modifying showering behavior. We conducted a covert true experiment across six tourist accommodations in Denmark, Spain, and the UK, where we deployed smart technology, in the form of a timer to provide the eco-feedback, coupled with persuasive messages. Data from over 17,500 showers showed that continuous, real-time eco-feedback reduced water runtime by 25.79% (CI = 8.24%; 39.98%). When the eco-feedback was paired with the most effective message-priming pro-environmental values and requiring a high effort to comply-water runtime was reduced by 23.55% (CI = 17.53%; 29.13%). The study's robust experimental design, and its emphasis on actual behavior measurement, highlight the potential of smart technology to facilitate resource conservation.\nVolunteer tourism organisations are largely unaccountable for the claims they make about generating benefits from the projects that they sell. The few evaluations of how volunteer tourism projects fail or succeed tend to underestimate the importance of contextual factors affecting the mechanisms introduced to achieve a desired sustainability outcome. Realistic evaluation is a recently developed methodology to critically develop testable context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) propositions that explain what works, for whom, under which circumstances. Our study makes a theoretical contribution by uniquely integrating realistic evaluation with collaboration theory to study the volunteer tourism supply chain, in order to demonstrate how to develop an evaluative framework to map out the components of CMO configurations. Our study also makes a methodological contribution by unpacking the black box of the mechanisms to deliver sustainable change through the supply chain of the volunteer tourism industry, which can be subsequently used to systematically monitor and evaluate context-specific circumstances that affect how different volunteering supply chains affect the sustainability of the projects\u2019 outcomes.\nWith the use of institutional theory, we study why organizations join a voluntary sustainable tourism association and how the organization\u2013association dynamics change over time. We find a disconnection between the joining and monitoring motivations for the association and its members that leads to conflicting forces and confusion, resulting in goal misalignment and loss of monitoring data. Voluntary associations need to accommodate for organizations' need of social identity, the desire to learn from each other and the sense of belonging from membership (mimetic forces), with the desire to institutionalize the members to behave in increasingly standardized way (normative and eventually coercive forces).\nWe study how risk conditions derived from the COVID-19 pandemic may impact on both the desire to travel and intention to visit of tourists and, therefore, on different stages of the destination choice process. We analyse 5134 million flight searches and 379 million flight picks during 2020 for the 17 largest European tourism source markets. An unweighted index number is employed to measure the average variation for searches and picks, for the year 2020, in relation to the reference base period (year 2019). This is done for air travel in general and to Spain specifically. The study then proceeds to conduct an analysis of 17 international travel destinations that are in the evoked sets of the two largest outbound markets in Europe (Germany and UK). We also identify which markets are most favourable to Spain. The research design can inform cost-efficient marketing decisions in a situation of high uncertainty.\nStakeholder consultations serve as powerful legitimising devices upon the balance of participants, the quality of the process and its effective results. We propose a deliberative digital stakeholder consultation methodology based on an appreciative inquiry approach to materiality assessment. We illustrate its application in a four-month consultation for the European Commission (2020 European Tourism Convention, towards a European Agenda for Tourism 2050). An interactive, online consultation (due to COVID-19) enabled dynamism and co-creation. Appreciative enquiry introduced the human elements of ownership and legitimacy towards policy. The choice of topics, language and attitudes reframed problems into opportunities with shared responsibilities. Technology allowed to explore new forms of open, democratic and inclusive engagement, and materiality provided structure and transparency that legitimised the process. \u2022A digital consultation articulates a European tourism COVID-19 recovery agenda.\u2022Online stakeholder consultation is fast, free, effective, efficient and democratic.\u2022Deliberative stakeholder consultation grows input, throughput and output legitimacy.\u2022Appreciative inquiry facilitates dialogic, transparent materiality assessment.\u2022Dialogic materiality assessment is effective in agenda-setting for public policy.\nSustainable tourism is not a static target, but a dynamic process of change, a transition. This book considers how monitoring using indicators can assist tourism to make such a sustainability transition. It encourages the reader to view tourism from a broad, interdisciplinary perspective and draws on material from a wide range of sources. The book explains why monitoring is important for different groups of stakeholders; public and private sector, NGOs and communities. It also examines important monitoring considerations such as what and where to measure, how much will monitoring cost and how the data can be presented. The book puts particular emphasis on indicator use and implementation. It highlights the process and techniques to develop and use indicators and then provides clear and detailed examples of monitoring in practice around the globe at different geographic scales. \u00a9 G.A.

This paper explores the successes and challenges of five programs operating partly or wholly in developing countries that have introduced socioeconomic criteria to complete the triple bottom line of sustainability. The analysis suggests that social standards are ambiguous; the assessment methodologies are inconsistent and open to interpretation; there is considerable variation on what is understood as sustainable depending on the type of tourism companies targeted; and the programs working more intensely on social issues will have the greatest challenges to expand. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\nA survey of around 900 tourism enterprises in 57 European protected areas shows that small firms are more involved in taking responsibility for being sustainable than previously expected, including eco-savings related operational practices but also reporting a wide range of social and economic responsibility actions. Two-step cluster analysis was used to group the firms in three groups based on their motivations to be sustainable. Business driven firms implement primarily eco-savings activities and are commercially oriented. Legitimization driven firms respond to perceived stakeholder pressure and report a broad spectrum of activities. Lifestyle and value driven firms report the greatest number of environmental, social and economic activities. No profile has a higher business performance than average. The study has implications for policy programmes promoting sustainability behaviour change based primarily on a business case argument.\nThis paper adds to previous conceptualisations of lifestyle entrepreneurship in tourism by framing the identity construction of such enterprises in terms of their ethical commitment to global issues, social and economic inequalities, and radical criticism of neoliberal capitalism. The study addresses a gap in the tourism studies literature which usually conceptualises entrepreneurs as either commercially oriented or lifestyle oriented. Such dichotomies do not easily accommodate entrepreneurs who are driven by a set of values associated with 'doing good'. A linguistic narrative analysis - combined with features of structural narrative analysis - is used to reveal three prominent entrepreneurial identities among a group of values-based Italian entrepreneurs: the intellectual and educational, the professional and entrepreneurial, and the empathic 'free speech'. These entrepreneurial identities challenge several assumptions about entrepreneurship in small non-commercially oriented tourism firms, thereby revealing some key theoretical and practical insights.\nThis research aims to identify, and critically understand, the key opportunities for and barriers against tour operators and their ground handlers sourcing and selling more sustainable tourism products. The study is framed in literature of organisational culture and buyer-seller collaborations both downstream (sustainable supply chain management) and upstream (business to business marketing). Semi-structured interviews help to identify the tour operators\u2019 barriers, opportunities and key decision making criteria. The findings suggest that a supportive organisational culture is a prerequisite to success for companies that wish to scale up the volume of sustainable products they source and sell. Sustainability only sells when it contributes to an organisation\u2019s ability to meet its requirement of quality of service, especially in relation to suitability of the products to its target markets and reinforcing professional and trustworthy relationships. For services that are keenly priced, and/or that have tight health and safety regulations, buyers and sellers often lack the motivation to consider sustainability requirements unless they are clearly valued and marketed. Business to business marketing requires suppliers to understand the relative importance of sustainability to each of their buyers and, in response, to develop appropriate arguments to explain the importance of sustainability within their buyers\u2019 organisational needs.\nMost travel trade associations ignore their responsibility towards sustainable development broadly and animal welfare in particular. We analyse the development and implementation of animal welfare standards across 62 national and international associations using interviews, surveys, content analysis of published materials and websites. Only 21 associations mention sustainability in their websites, and only 6 refer to animal welfare. Of these, three associations have well-developed animal welfare activities (ABTA, ANVR and GSTC) and only one (lightly) monitors its members\u2019 sustainability and animal welfare standards (ANVR). ABTA\u2019s Animal Welfare Guidelines are the de facto industry standard, despite being designed for information (not auditing) purposes and lacking enforcement mechanisms. We examine jolts that prompt some associations to respond to external pressures and the institutional entrepreneurship process that triggers a process of reflexivity, theorisation and diffusion of a broader sense of responsibility. We examine the field-level conditions that lead to mostly mimetic pressures on large European tour operators (that compel them to act due to reputational risk management), with minimal normative pressures that would diffuse animal welfare practices across other association members. Change is not divergent, and the resources allocated to animal welfare protect trade associations\u2019 members from criticism without binding them to implementation.\nThere is limited research studying how pro-environmental behavioural intentions gained in a tourism context subsequently influence intentions and actual behaviour at home. This study reports on a three-stage study that surveys Chinese domestic tourists on holiday, and at home one week and one month after the holiday experience. The findings suggest that the stated pro-environmental intention on holiday does not convert into actual pro-environmental behaviour at home. Neither pro-environmental intention nor pro-environmental behaviour are seen to change over time or location. It is the availability of infrastructure (physical context) that affects a change, as evidenced by Dinghu Mountain National Nature Reserve, which provides environmental information and significantly more facilities to enable pro-environmental behaviour than Chinese nationals find in their daily home environment. Implications are offered for ways to apply the ABC theory to policies that seek to achieve long-term environmental behavioural change, such as strong government policy interventions.\nThis paper outlines the consultation of recreation managers and stakeholders in forests in the United Kingdom, Portugal and Finland regarding their use of Environmental Management Systems (EMS) to plan, manage and monitor visitor impacts, The results show that there is a critical mass of sites already using the components of an EMS or capable of doing so, with some potential to fully implement an EMS. This informs the development of criteria of an EU funded feasibility study for an ecolabel for forest recreation and tourism sites.\nAbstract This section of the journal encourages discussion between several authors on a policy-related topic. The same question may, therefore, be addressed from different theoretical, cultural or spatial perspectives. Dialogues may be applied or highly abstract. This Dialogue starts with this contribution and is followed by three comments by Jim Butcher http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19407963.2016.1258512; Fernando Correia http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19407963.2016.1258511; Mary G. McDonald http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19407963.2016.1258513. Introduction Academics are expected to engage with industry and policy-makers to conduct research that has impact. For those of us researching sustainable tourism, this means creating a positive benefit on the triple bottom line of the environment, society and the economy, and therefore the mandate of creating an impact could be seen as a legitimisation of our inner calling. But these same academics are faced with the conflict of engaging in a policy-making process that is not fit for purpose, and that appropriates and narrowly defines the sustainability discourse, stifling a deeper and more meaningful debate of whether the purpose of sustainable tourism is to make the tourism industry more sustainable, or to use tourism as a tool for sustainable development (Sharpley, 2000 Sharpley, R. (2000). Tourism and sustainable development: Exploring the theoretical divide. Journal of Sustainable Tourism, 8(1), 1\u201319. doi: 10.1080/09669580008667346 [Taylor & Francis Online] ). This dialogue starts with an opinion piece on the challenges to achieve meaningful impact when the system pays lip service to the ill-defined concept of sustainability, that most individuals do not want to implement because changing one\u2019s behaviour is complex, and as such the policy instruments developed are half-hearted. Consumers tend to misunderstand the causes and consequences of unsustainable behaviour, and their cognitive dissonance between what they do and want to believe in results in downplaying the importance of the impacts caused. Sustainability is subservient to trade and consumption, and many sustainability policies are implemented to be able to justify continued over-development, which may explain why the sustainability solutions implemented do not compensate for the increased consumption. This allows consumers to enjoy without guilt experiences marketed as sustainable, while the market-based instruments introduced to inform consumer choice have limited effect. The dialogue calls for tourism academics to conduct research that is purposefully informing behaviour change, in full knowledge of the limitations of the system we work within.\nMethods to capture the complexity of using policy instruments would allow us to better evaluate the reasons for their effectiveness. Drawing from complexity science, we produce a Causal Loop Diagram to analyse the implementation of two informational policy instruments in a tourism destination: the Global Sustainable Tourism Council criteria and the European Tourism Indicator Scheme. To interpret the emerging system structure, we use complexity theory concepts of emergence; interdependence and interconnectivity; co-evolution; self-organisation; feedback; historicity and path dependence. This qualitative methodology sheds light on the interplay of factors that facilitate and impede the continuous use of these policy instruments. It shows how adopting a complexity science approach to evaluation studies can be invaluable to making tourism policy interventions more impactful. \u2022Evaluations of policy instruments should acknowledge tourism policy complexity.\u2022Causal Loop Diagrams help detect what facilitates and hinders policy instrument use.\u2022Complexity theory concepts help interpret non-linearity in policy instrument use.\u2022We help tourism managers navigate the complexities of using policy instruments.\nSpain currently produces around 7000 million litres of mineral water a year, of which about 20% is produced in Catalonia, and there is a need for greater regulation and research into bottled waters and their impact on human health. A total of 29 samples were analysed from different brands of commercially bottled water, and 71 chemical elements were determined in each sample. The aim was to classify each brand based on composition, compare lithological origins, verify compliance with international standards for drinking water, and report benefits for human health. More than 60% of the samples were of the calcium bicarbonate type, had a low mineral content, and were associated with granitic aquifers, ranging from leucogranites to granodiorites. In contrast, 17% were of the sodium bicarbonate type, had harder waters, and were related to thermal springs. The thermal springs of the bottled waters from the Montseny-Guilleres massif (Vichy Catalan, Malavella, and San Narciso) emerge at a temperature of 60 degrees C with their own natural gas. Two samples exceeded European standards for As and Hg concentrations in water for human consumption, while one showed a concentration of U greater than that set out in international recommendations.\nCreating shared value (CSV) involves connecting company success with social progress. This shared element of CSV resonates with the mandate of destination management organisations to be accountable to all stakeholders for the progress of the destination. This study tests the feasibility of a destination\u2019s stakeholders adopting a CSV approach and by doing so, to take responsibility for that destination\u2019s future. Semi-structured interviews gathered opinions from 16 members of the General Council, the Executive Committee, and the Steering Committee of the highly acclaimed Turisme de Barcelona (TdB), the official organisation for the promotion of tourism in Barcelona, Spain. The results show that the complexities of changing the organisation\u2019s mandate, in a public-private partnership where consensus is needed, would be extremely difficult to navigate. Even if possible, the outcomes would likely step on the toes of other institutions. The feasibility of integrating CSV into the mandate, in order to move destination marketing organisations towards destination management organisations is problematised as a 'wicked' problem using Foucault's notion of power in stakeholder relationships. The results show the inherent difficulties of introducing sustainability values into a multi-stakeholder, public-private partnership, and allow lessons to be drawn about how realistic CSV may be as a guiding philosophy.\nThis paper explores global differences in travel risk perception based on i) attitudes towards travel abroad, and ii) the time required to plan travel. Baseline data from 2019 is compared with data from 2020, the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. A methodology based on Big Data is developed through the Skyscanner metasearch engine, working with 20,756 million flight searches and 1979 million flight picks worldwide. We conduct an exploratory analysis by region, followed by a cluster analysis of 45 countries. We argue that the findings respond to uncertainty avoidance, with clear differences between Europe, America and Asia-Pacific. This knowledge has marketing implications for tourist destinations in terms of what marketing messages to convey and the best time to introduce marketing campaigns for each country or group of countries, so that the opportunity for reactivation of tourism is maximised.\nThis article presents a grounded theory to explain why some small businesses in tourism adopt sustainable business practices while others do not, even when they share environmental and wider sustainability concerns. It does so based on research undertaken among business owners in Crete. The paper starts by considering studies on sustainability awareness, knowledge and the mechanisms for accepting responsibility. Secondly, it summarises the influence of task difficulty and effort on sustainability self-efficacy. Thirdly, it focuses on social comparisons and vicarious experiences, as a way of learning what is important. Finally, it examines powerlessness due to perceived situational constraints. In so doing, the study finds that self-efficacy helps to explain sustainable attitude formation and the attitude-behaviour gap; it partly shifts the locus of responsibility for an inability to act sustainably away from the individual and towards their context. The paper contributes to the theoretical literature on small businesses and sustainability, and leads to new avenues for policy interventions.\nTourists' perceptions of climate change affect decisions and choices to visit destinations, which are disappearing because of climate change impacts. Values and motivations are two of the personal variables underpinning tourists' decisions. The study addresses both the limited values research in tourism and reveals unconscious motives by using projective techniques. Projective techniques avoid some of the social desirability bias present in much ethical research. Choice ordering technique and the list of values assist by assigning importance, with narrative responses providing meaning. The construction technique builds a story from a stimulus, with photo-elicitation using participants' personal holiday photographs. A sample of pre, during and post visit tourists to the Arctic and Venice were interviewed. Results, which provide a more nuanced understanding of how the personal variables of values and motivations are underpinned by self-interest, inform policies and the messages designed to influence pro-sustainability behaviour.\nWhile extensive research covers the disclosure of performance in sustainability reports, there is limited understanding of the process of how such reports are developed and whose priorities they reflect. We investigate the sustainability reporting, focusing on stakeholder-related practices disclosed by the 50 largest hotel groups worldwide, by testing the AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard. We use the three interrelated dimensions (inclusiveness, materiality and responsiveness) to assess the disclosure of how organisations (1) identify and engage with stakeholders, (2) determine the importance of sustainability issues, and (3) respond to stakeholder concerns. We find the low transparency and imprecision of decision-making criteria and processes suggest sustainability reporting is more of a legitimisation exercise than one of accountability. We find the stakeholder identification approach does not inform the organisation's transparency, whereas the dialogue mechanisms used to empower stakeholders, as their participatory role in decision-making and the reporting process, shape the disclosure of materiality and responsiveness. We demonstrate how that the ability to determine stakeholder engagement, materiality analysis and responsiveness of the sustainability reporting process can improve the role of sustainability reports as a mechanism for accountability, and we argue the importance of the alignment between the degree of disclosure on inclusiveness, materiality and responsiveness\nSustainability policies and corporate reports demonstrate the impacts cruise companies acknowledge as their responsibility, and the actions put in place to address them. This paper develops a corporate social responsibility index based on the Global Reporting Initiative, with industry specific additions including labor and human rights, health and safety, and environmental and economic aspects. Companies disclose more management than performance data, which is typical of early stages of development. Companies disclosing less information focus on soft indicators which are easy to mimic and demonstrate posturing. Items disclosed tend to be marginal to the core of the business, have a positive economic impact or pre-empt sector regulation. Reports echo the voice of the corporations and not the demands of stakeholders. Institutional isomorphism has not influenced a homogenization in reporting, with only the largest firms reporting at this stage.\nPurpose - This paper aims to analyse the influence of environmental proactivity on cost and differentiation competitive advantages, and to explore the double relationship between environmental proactivity and business performance. Design/methodology/approach - The population consists of all three- to five-star hotels in Spain. A sample of 350 hotels was classified according to environmental proactivity and performance levels, employing a two-step cluster analysis. Significant differences between groups were examined. Findings - The results show two types of environmental behaviour (reactive and proactive), with proactive hotels developing significantly better on both cost and differentiation competitive advantage and achieving significantly higher performance levels. Hotels which achieve above average business performance levels are significantly more environmentally proactive. Research limitations/implications - The present paper demonstrates that environmental management is related to competitive advantages and business performance. Environmental management systems are more developed in higher category, chain-affiliated and larger hotels. This could be due to having more resources to develop their environmental capability. The environmental proactivity scale employed in this study is presented as a reference measure for hotel managers to benchmark their current practices and implement environmental improvements. Originality/value - First, measuring environmental proactivity using four managerial systems (operative, information, strategic and technical) is innovative and provides a more detailed approach to measuring environmental proactivity. Second, demonstrating a double association between environmental proactivity and performance provides fresh insights into the relationship between these variables.\nWe aimed to evaluate the impact of sustainable tourism indicators on destination competitiveness with reference to the European Tourism Indicator System (ETIS), a scheme funded by the European Commission to address the evidence gap in tourism policy making. To do this, we evaluate the absorptive capacity of destination management organisations (DMOs) to implement and use sustainable tourism indicators to make policy decisions. We provide evidence of how DMOs have acquired knowledge about the importance of sustainable tourism indicators through ETIS, and how they have assimilated it by developing their own systems based on the principles of ETIS. However, we find that the European Commission had unrealistic expectations that DMOs, or their policies, would be transformed as a result of the use of indicators, or that indicators would be exploited to improve tourism sustainability and competitiveness. We contribute to the study of policy science by showing how absorptive capacity can be used to analyse and evaluate policy interventions, despite being a linear rational approach to explaining a complex policy context.\nWe develop a methodology to identify patterns between sustainability motivations, actions, and engagement. We apply this methodology to analyse a 3 \u00bd year intervention that yielded 151 sustainability actions undertaken by 46 outbound tour operators. We find three aspects that can be explained by the tour operators\u2019 motivations to act sustainably, namely a connection between: i) the actions taken in the context of the organisation\u2019s business model, ii) the intensity of the approach, measured by the resources invested in it and the operator\u2019s commitment level, and iii) the evolution of the response. These patterns demonstrate how ethical motivations are common and a precondition to acting sustainably but, in themselves, these motivations are not sufficient to integrate sustainability practices into the core business or to maintain commitment over time. It is the combination of a high ethical commitment with clear strategic intent, materialised in commercial and operational motivations, that increases the connectedness, and intensity, of sustainability actions amongst ethically committed firms.\nAn increasing number of hospitality firms attempt to foster sustainable practices among their customers. Amongst these, incentives for customers to bring their own reusable products stand out. In this study, we analyse the explanatory factors of the willingness of consumers to bring a reusable container if a discount is offered and the minimum discount required in order for these consumers to be willing to do so. Several factors are proposed to explain an individual\u2019s willingness to bring a reusable coffee cup (RCC) including their environmental concern and involvement, personal restrictions for using an RCC, and socio-demographic characteristics. An empirical application, conducted on 1,371 individuals using the Heckit model, allows us to conduct a joint modelisation and provide a novel methodological contribution to the study of the willingness, and barriers, of individuals towards the use of RCCs in the coffee shop industry.\nEthical decisions to visit disappearing destinations are self-serving and influences feed into self-interest. Data were collected from a sample of pre-, during- and post-visit tourists to Venice and Svalbard, using expressive techniques and scenarios using the Hunt\u2013Vitell model to understand ethical decisions, and the constructive technique and collage to understand influences. The results show that travel decisions are driven by individual selfishness, and any threat to freedom (i.e. the right to travel) is underplayed. The preferred scenario for long-term benefit for planet and people is via short-term economic and social negative impacts on the destination\u2019s locals, rather than the tourists\u2019 own experience. Respondents believe that they are blameless for their purchasing habits as they lack perceived behavioural control, and instead corporations ought to be providing sustainable products as the norm and not sell products that harm. In the scenarios, where respondents express concern for the locals in a disappearing destination (i.e. if we do not visit, they will not benefit from our expenditure), individual selfishness to visit could be the driver, rather than an altruistic act to provide support. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed.\nThe Materiality Balanced Scorecard is an integrated framework that links sustainable hospitality performance management and reporting, as an instrument to define, communicate and operationalise strategic sustainability objectives. We integrate the Balanced Scorecard as a well-established performance management system with the inclusiveness, materiality and responsiveness principles of the AA1000 Stakeholder Engagement Standard, to aid an organisation to respond to its stakeholder expectations. The framework provides a systemic, structured and integrated approach, and an opportunity for sustainable value creation. We test the framework with data reported by 20 of the world\u2019s largest hotel groups, to find that current sustainability reports lack hierarchical cause-and-effect chains and hard evidence of impact at the system level. We argue that hospitality organisations can improve their management controls by addressing the quality, transparency and consistency of their sustainability response, thereby responding to sustainable development challenges without undermining their organisational viability.\nWe advocate the adoption of more expansive and creative methodological approaches the study of tourism. More specifically, we argue that by examining how individuals narrate their experiences and social practices, researchers can gain an insight into the meanings actors attach to their actions. Considered from this perspective, narratives become performative; they prompt actors to take actions that (they feel) actualise the story they are seeking to tell. To illustrate its value, we use linguistic narrative analysis to explore how the owner-managers of small values-based tourism firms narrate the operation of their business. A dataset of first person accounts made of both narratives in storified form featuring a chronological order with beginning, middle, and end, and narratives without a storified form largely recounting opinions, feelings, and points of view, are interpreted to offer new perspectives on the behaviours of small firms in tourism. We argue that narrative approaches should complement methods used routinely by tourism scholars to examine this constituency of actors (and others).\nWhile there is a growing literature related with corporate social responsibility (CSR) in hospitality and tourism large firms, much remains to be done in the case of CSR in tourism small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In this paper we provide three studies regarding this particular aspect through the evidence present in different destinations: Catalonia, European natural parks and Chile. Among the conclusions that can be highlighted is the prevalence of altruism in the reasons for being responsible, the introduction of increasingly advanced measures or their impact on different business variables, and the link to financial performance.\nThe Carbon Footprint Calculator featured here is part of the SusTPol project (Sustainable Tourism evidence-informed Policy), an initiative funded by the EU with the goal of promoting sustainable tourism practices. The SusTPol project is specifically focused on assisting Destination Marketing and Management Organizations (DMMOs) in making informed decisions by Sustainable Tourism Indicators. This Carbon Footprint Calculator can help DMMOs to take steps towards reducing the environmental impact of their tourism activities.\nThis study explores the way in which consumers interpret and process the marketing and communication of sustainable forms of tourism in destinations, in order to inform policy makers about the appropriateness of different types of sustainability messages. Through a thematic analysis of focus group data, we explore the ways in which consumers engage with, and respond to, explicit discourses of sustainability in marketing a tourist destination. We find that overt discourses of sustainability are often rejected by consumers, thus suggesting that messages concerned with sustainability should place greater priority upon consumer experience and opportunities afforded by the purchase and consumption of the travel experience (that happens to be sustainable) they can expect at their chosen destination. As such, commitments to sustainability manifest within organisational philosophy and practice should not drive the principle, overt discourse communicated to consumers. Rather, as embedded within product and practice, such messages would have greater power and effect if they occupied a more subliminal position in destination marketing materials.\nAttempts to promoting sustainable tourism and ecotourism as quality products suffer from the lack of methods to ensure these are not just a green wash. The current proliferation of awards, labels and endorsements has confused consumers to the extent of preferring to ignore these green messages. Several initiatives have emerged to address the proliferation of small, little known, limited value ecolabels in tourism and hospitality, and to ensure that the larger ones meet internationally accepted criteria. This paper will review progress made by a wide range of public, private and non-profit agencies in developing environmental standards and method to measure them, which will be set against the internationally agreed process for compliance assessment. From the above experiences, the author will outline the prospects to environmental certification in tourism and hospitality, which are the development of an international accreditation system, following agreed standards, and linked to national, regional or sector-specific certification programmes. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Mixed methods were used to study perceptions of EMAS and reasons for being certified, with current and lapsed EMAS-certified firms triangulated against expert interviews and documentary evidence. Four groups of hotels were differentiated: Strategic hotels (22%) (with high levels of integrated environmental management), Followers (48%), Greenwashers (11%) and Laggers (19%) (with low levels of integrated environmental management). Most hotels were found to be internally driven in their purpose and ad hoc in their decision-making, with limited understanding of externally driven benefits and motivation for more systematic management systems. This questions the success of EMAS as both a continuous improvement management and as a market-based regulation tool for hotels. Few hotels overall related high environmental standards to the possibilities of gaining market advantage: most wished to avoid legal challenges. The paper also illustrates the ways in which hotels opportunistically switch certification systems to get what they see as a better deal.\nAcademia is generally carbon intensive. Many academics are highly aeromobile to an extent that is now being framed as a form of 'climate hypocrisy'. Technological advances are not enough to reduce the negative impacts of flying, and behaviour change is needed. As tourism academics our knowledge of the industry means that we have a greater than average responsibility to show leadership, and yet currently will remain responsible for a disproportionate amount of carbon emissions. At individual and societal levels, we morally disengage from the significance of our impacts and exonerate ourselves with worthy causes, we absolve ourselves from personal responsibility, we disregard the impacts at the destination, and we discredit those impinging on our \"rights\" to fly. It is time for academic institutions to take responsibility and for academics to show leadership in the sector by auditing our own impacts, reducing them within our current institutional constraints, and envisaging and experimenting with low carbon business models that make us proud of being part of a sustainable solution, and not just reporting how unsustainable everyone else's behaviour is.\nThe relationship between sustainability, competitive advantages, and performance is a topic with no conclusive results in the tourism industry. To contribute to the debate, the purpose of this study is i) to analyze the influence of sustainability on cost and differentiation competitive advantages and ii) to examine the possible synergistic relationship between sustainability and performance. Perceptual as well as hotel-specific objective performance measurements are used, such as occupancy rate, average daily rate (ADR), and revenues per available room (RevPAR), to examine all the relationships. Structural equation models based on Partial Least Squares (PLS-SEM) are applied to test all the hypotheses. Data is collected from 3-, 4- and 5-star hotels in Spain. The results show that sustainability positively and significantly influences cost and differentiation advantages, perceptual performance, ADR, and RevPAR. In addition, those hotels with these three performance variables whose values are above the median obtain a significant relationship between sustainability and performance. Consequently, there is evidence of a synergistic sustainability-performance relationship in the hotel industry. Therefore, this study offers academic evidence on the strong relationships that exist between these variables in the hotel industry. This research work analyses all three sustainability pillars (economic, environmental, and social sustainability), and the practices that best explain each of the three sustainability pillars are indicated so that hotel managers can optimize their sustainable management.\nThe impact of mainstream tourist hotels on destination economies is clearly an important question for public policy-makers wishing to develop robust tourism policy. We adapt the methodology of value chain analysis to measure the local economic impact of a large, single tourism enterprise, to show how to generate commercially realistic data using the example of an analysis of a 1000 room all-inclusive resort in southern Turkey in partnership with TUI UK and Ireland. The data break down package revenues according to their beneficiaries and identifies areas for improvement. We further report and reflect on a 6-month evaluation of a tour operator-hotel partnership to deliver on a set of positive recommendations arising from the date to improve future impact.\nAwards and labels can help consumers choose more environmentally benign tourism products and encourage more attention to the environment by producers. As in other areas, however, there is an increasing clutter of environmental awards and labels in tourism. Concerns exist about the value and appropriateness of some claims associated with these. This paper reviews and assesses environmental awards in tourism and recreation using comparative analysis. Sixteen awards relating to manufacturing, forestry, tourist attractions and tourism companies are appraised under the classifications of focus, criteria, certification system and results. Having identified the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches it is concluded that the time is ripe to rationalise awards and labels in the tourism industry and that an environmental management systems approach provides a flexible template to fulfil such a need and drive the agenda of environmental improvements in the industry.\nThis book provides a holistic approach to understand the challenges and opportunities related to the planning and management of sustainable development in tourism. The editors present a collection of empirical studies, best-practice cases, and theoretical discussions to draw insights on the economic, social, environmental, and political dimensions of sustainability. Specifically, using a range of case studies examining sustainability applications within various tourism industry sectors as well as different geographical regions, this book is of value to tourism policymakers, practitioners, academicians, and students, encouraging them to develop proactive behavior. This publication represents an up-to-date, innovative guide in helping readers understand the challenges facing sustainable tourism development and implementation as well as the potential opportunities for both developed and developing nations in pursuing sustainability goals in their tourism plans. .\nLittle is known about the factors underlying the pro-environmental behaviour of marketing managers. This paper explores the determinants of green marketing practices in the Red Sea hotel sector in Egypt. The research model assesses green marketing practices against the personal and organisational values of the marketing managers, together with a range of organisational and demographic variables expected to influence hotels\u2019 environmental behaviour. From a valid sample of 89 marketing managers responsible for 194 hotels, it was found that organisational contextual variables, and in particular targeting Western tourists, being affiliated to an international hotel chain and the marketers\u2019 own demographics, including age, academic subject studied and gender, were the best predictors of more proactive green marketing. Personal environmental values did not explain the pro-environmental behaviour of marketers, and the organisational environmental values that had explained part of their ethical behaviour had resulted from voluntarism rather than utilitarian or conformance-based values. Government policies also appeared to be ineffective determinants. The implications for green marketing practices are also discussed.\nSustainability communication in accommodation businesses tends to be factual and descriptive, as companies are concerned with product-based messages that focus on what they do; they appear not to understand the potential benefits of constructing messages that would influence consumers to behave more sustainably, which is effectively sustainability marketing myopia. An analysis of 1,835 sustainability messages from award-winning businesses shows that messages communicate facts not emotions, and benefits for society as a whole rather than for the individual customer. The messages are explicit, but passive and not experiential hence they positively affect the cognitive but not the affective image of the business. The lack of message normalization and customer focus reinforces the image of sustainability being a niche concern. We reflect on the reasons for these shortcomings and highlight opportunities to improve persuasive communication, which we have now applied commercially in more than 400 website analyses and 60 training courses.\nThe need for sound, progressive policy is important but the robust evidence upon which to base realistic policy, and the institutional capacity and political appetite to deliver it, are often lacking. The paper reviews the link between evidence and policy and highlights recent methodological advances in value chain analysis which allow researchers to efficiently collect relatively robust policy-relevant evidence in data-poor contexts. It summarises the evidence generated from a World Bank study of tourism in Ethiopia that questioned important tenets of tourism policy and strategy, to assess the extent to which this evidence has been taken up into policy and to account for the apparent failure of evidence up-take. We conclude that the failure of evidence-based policy may have had as much to do with weaknesses in the research process as with the indigenous policy-making process.\nPurpose \u2013 The purpose of this paper is to test whether volunteer tourism organisations are prepared to learn from feedback on the quality of their responsibility communications, and consider whether analysis and communication of results can influence market improvement. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 A purposive sample of five influential website pages of eight volunteer tourism organisations are scored across 19 responsible voluntourism criteria, and compared against the results of two years previously. Findings \u2013 The authors report mixed results on how communicating results has encouraged change and industry improvement in responsibility, based on previous research that showed responsibility to be communicated inconsistently at best, potentially greenwashing at worst, across organisations, product types and responsible values. Research limitations/implications \u2013 The paper applies sustainability marketing literature to explain the changes in responsibility communication performance using an innovative tool to benchmark and audit responsibility in online marketing content and providing insight into how best practice marketing necessitates responsible operations. This paper considers whether and how, when presented with evidence, organisations choose to improve for a more responsible voluntourism offer. Originality/value \u2013 The paper is original in providing a practical, industry-informed analysis of the reasons why volunteer operators communicate in the way they do, and the ability to influence their communications to be more reliable, in the context of increased criticism for shallow volunteering. This experiment allows industry associations and lobby groups to influence industry practice based on the evidence that improved communications are possible when specific, tailored advice is provided.\nSmall firms in tourism are characterised by informal approaches to management, allowing their owners to meet a variety of often overlapping business and personal goals. Environmental certification schemes generally require members to subscribe to formal environmental management systems (EMS), even when aimed at small business operators. This paper examines in detail the managerial approaches of a small group of owner-managers who are operating within the approximately 3000-member Green Tourism Business Scheme (GTBS) available in the UK and Ireland. The findings suggest that the type of environmental practices adopted most willingly reflect the formality of management within the business and the owner-managers\u2019 various backgrounds, values, reasons to be in business, expectations from acting and their understanding of the \"environment\". It finds that the \"Plan-Do-Check-Review\" approach of most EMS does not easily relate to the complex motivations and needs of the world of small business. The paper concludes that environmental engagement is more likely to be fostered if owner-managers\u2019 managerial approaches and assumptions are better understood and that shared visions for environmental engagement are encouraged through informed dialogue. Both economic benefits and the fostering of \"feel good\" factors should be stressed if small tourism businesses are to adopt EMS programmes.\nPurpose \u2013 This paper demonstrates how the tour operating industry must take responsibility of the sustainability of its suppliers as part of the quality expected by tourists, in order to remain competitive. Design/methodology/approach \u2013 Case studies resulting from telephone surveys, interviews and document searches. The theoretical approach is that of using sustainable supply chain management both as a method of corporate social responsibility and a strategy for industry survival. Findings \u2013 Price wars have forced mass tourism operators to small margins, while ignoring the growing special interest market. Sustainability is now part of quality expectations and the industry as a whole has to reinvent itself to meet changing demands, while also embedding corporate social responsibility in a way that makes business sense. Research limitations/implications \u2013 The challenge is transferring experience to less sophisticated and mature markets, where at present there is little evidence of demand for sustainable products. Practical implications \u2013 Industry wide standards are necessary as the lever for change in those industries where short return on investment eco\u2010savings will not be possible, and where the future of a whole industry relies on joint action. Originality/value \u2013 The paper makes a contribution to the limited knowledge of sustainable supply chain management in the service sector. Most research emphasizes environmental issues in manufacturing.\nWhat motivates firms to adopt environmental management practices is one of the most significant aspects in the contemporary academic debate in which the review of the existing literature yields, with an obvious contextual bias toward developed world, contested theories and inconclusive findings. Providing a unique model that brings together the individual and organizational levels of analysis on firms\u2019 adoption of environmental management practices, this study aims to provide a new insight from the context of developing world. Data from 158 Red Sea hotels reveal two identifiable dimensions of environmental management\u2014planning and organization, and operations\u2014that can be explained as originating from different values. Whereas organizational altruism is a powerful predictor of both dimensions, managers\u2019 personal values and organizational competitive orientation are only relevant to environmental operations. The evidence also indicates that contextual variables such as chain affiliation, hotel star rating, and size are important to explain hotels\u2019 environmental management behaviors.\nPurpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence of customers\u2019 environmental concerns, customers\u2019 perceptions of a hotel\u2019s environmental practices and of the hotels\u2019 environmentally friendly images, on their willingness to pay a price premium to stay at environmentally friendly hotels. Design/methodology/approach The theoretical framework comprises both the Social Identity Theory and the Value-Belief-Norm Theory. The data was collected from a survey conducted to 454 customers staying at eco-friendly hotels in Spain. The research model is tested by using a structural equation modelling approach. Findings The findings illustrate that customers\u2019 environmental concerns have a greater explanatory value on their willingness to pay a price premium than do their perceptions of the hotel\u2019s environmental practices. Furthermore, these causal relationships are similar in magnitude when considering the mediating effects of the hotel\u2019s environmentally eco-friendly image and the environmental practices. Practical Implications The empirical findings provide managers with a better understanding of how customers\u2019 environmental concerns, and their senses of identification with environmentally friendly hotels, influence their behavioural intentions towards willingness to pay a premium. The findings help hoteliers to understand how to market their products in such a way that their environmentally friendly practices are not perceived as being achieved at the expense of any other set of benefits; few customers will appreciate a trade-off in benefits, particularly to oneself. Originality/Value The paper contributes to the literature by highlighting those cognitive processes that influence the customers\u2019 willingness to pay a price premium to stay at environmentally friendly hotels. Hence, the study provides valuable information to hotel managers.\nWe use the concept of absorptive capacity to better understand the relationship between sustainability information acquisition, proactivity and performance. A quantitative analysis of a survey of 408 tourism enterprises in Catalonia (Spain) shows that: i) growth-oriented motivations are related to communication with industry-related sources, and to individual and informal channels, while lifestyle motivations are related to communication with other stakeholders; ii) sustainability implementation is related to communication with other stakeholders, to the use of collective and formal channels, and to the perceived usefulness of information; and iii) sustainability performance is related to the introduction of environmental and economic practices, to the use of both industry and broader sources of information, and to the perceived usefulness of information. We suggest that sustainability training and education may be more successful in achieving behaviour change when they are adapted to the absorptive capacity and learning styles of their target audiences.\nThe past decade has seen significant growth in the tourism and hospitality literature on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Indeed, over 70% of the articles on this topic have been published in the past five years. Through the application of a stakeholder lens, this paper explores how CSR has developed within the extant literature, paying particular attention to current gaps and highlighting the contributions of the research in this special issue. This emerging research on CSR in the context of tourism and hospitality is pushing past the boundaries of early approaches to corporate sustainability by providing empirical evidence to support the importance of integrating a range of stakeholder perspectives and needs throughout the planning, implementation, and evaluation of CSR initiatives. We observe that while there is ample research on certain stakeholder groups such as management, employees, shareholders, and consumers, there is less emphasis on the role of communities and ecosystems as stakeholders and very little related to suppliers, NGOs, and government. Although tourism and hospitality firms may not be subject to the same pressures as other industries, there remain important opportunities to both document and engage these external stakeholders in the journey towards sustainability.\nSustainability and Poverty Alleviation in Developing Countries. The Role of the Hotelier and the Researcher. This article reflects on the process of sustainable change that took place within a project in Colombia to improve the contribution of hotels towards poverty alleviation. Most donor projects for poverty alleviation are community based projects, usually business start-ups, or capacity building of small firms. A forgotten area of research and practice has been the benefits of the supply chains of hotels and other tourism companies, particularly in mass tourism destinations. This action research project considers the behaviour of hotels towards their corporate social responsibility, and the meaning of actions taken and planned as the outcome of a workshop.\nEste trabalho \u00e9 resultado de avalia\u00e7\u00e3o de uma iniciativa do Turismo de Base Local (CBT) no Peru, pela companhia de turismo GAP Adventures e sua funda\u00e7\u00e3o, a Planeterra.

Num n\u00edvel mais profundo de an\u00e1lise procurou- se compreender os fatores cr\u00edticos de sucesso para esta iniciativa, quais sejam: as liga\u00e7\u00f5es com o setor privado; a proximidade com o mercado de turismo; a cria\u00e7\u00e3o de produtos atraentes e competitivos; a lucratividade; a vontade da comunidade para se engajar-se no turismo, e; a implementa\u00e7\u00e3o de um processo de monitoramento e avalia\u00e7\u00e3o. Considerou-se que a an\u00e1lise de projetos neste n\u00edvel mais profundo ajudar\u00e1 tomar decis\u00f5es mais informadas sobre os projetos de CBT podem ser vi\u00e1veis, se a comunidade estiver apoiada por doadores, com chances de sobreviv\u00eancia financeira.\nCorporate social responsibility practices have been mostly analyzed in the large manufacturing business context, with little attention paid to the service sector and even less to small and medium-sized accommodation enterprises. This study aims to fill this gap through analyzing how these enterprises take responsibility. A survey of nearly 400 enterprises showed that the main reason for acting responsibly is altruistic, although competitiveness reasons are also important. Aspects of the \u201cresource-based view\u201d of the firm are validated through the positive impact of environmental cost-savings in financial performance, but also because other practices (not always related with economic reasons) are influencing their competitiveness. The article concludes that further implementation of these practices is necessary to achieve the full potential of competitive advantages.\nThis chapter reflects on the challenges of promoting corporate environmental and social responsibility among tour operators, through the efforts made by the Our Operators' Initiative for Sustainable Tourism Development (TOI), a network of tour operators who seek to improve their environmental performance and to incorporate sustainable development principles in their business operations. The chapter focuses on the range of indicators decided upon by the TOI, presented under 5 areas of management: product management and development, internal management, supply chain management, customer relations, and cooperation with destinations.\nThe pressures of tourism on rural destinations have meant that environmental considerations have become paramount. Practical solutions to delicate problems are being sought. This volume, the result of the EU-funded TOURFOR Project, brings together current thinking and synthesizes it for students and practitioners alike. With case studies of rural destinations - especially woodland and forest - from the UK, Portugal and England, the book is linked to the EU's good management award scheme.\nEfforts to design and communicate sustainable tourism products have been based on the premise of explicit market demand for sustainability. This study tests whether it is possible to design mainstream sustainable tourism products that circumvent customer scrutiny of their sustainability features, by making sustainability implicit (as part of quality product design) and communicating hedonistic benefits instead. This is akin to using the peripheral route of communication, as explained in the Elaboration Likelihood Model, as the central route emphasises the consumer-driven message of overall quality of experience; the approach lessens the need for customers to be conscious of the sustainability consequences of their actions. The methodology proposed to achieve this is User-Centred Design (UCD), which places insights into customer needs, values and demands at the heart of new product design. We designed sustainable tourist activities using UCD and then appraised customer demand for them. Although this may seem counterintuitive, the results show that it can be more effective than traditional methods in mainstreaming sustainable activities, through choice-editing of unsustainable ones and normalising the appearance and communication of sustainability, provided a focus on sustainability is maintained by the product provider.\nTourism marketing has typically been seen as exploitative and fuelling hedonistic consumerism. Sustainability marketing can, however, use marketing skills and techniques to good purpose, by understanding market needs, designing more sustainable products, and identifying more persuasive methods of communication to bring behavioural change. This article summarises the latest research on the theories, methods and results of marketing that seeks to make tourist destinations better places to live in, and better places to visit. It explores sustainability marketing\u2019s two fundamental approaches, that of market development, using market segmentation, and that of sustainable product development. It introduces a Special Issue of the Journal of Sustainable Tourism on sustainable marketing, sharing evidence on the motivations, mechanisms and barriers that businesses encounter, and on successes in changing consumer behaviour and pursuing sustainability goals. Particular attention is given to the methodologies of sustainable tourism marketing, to the subject\u2019s breadth and complexity, and to its many innovations. Further research is called for to fully understand what contextual aspects influence these pro-sustainability interventions to achieve which outcomes in other settings, in order to validate some of the exploratory studies discussed, and establish the feasibility of scaling up pilot studies for more general use.\nStandards are documents that establish a basis, example, or principle for firms to conform to, linked to uniform units of measurement. Compulsory standards are enforced through national legislation and industry membership requirements and tend to cover health and safety, competence standards, occupational safety, land-use planning, licensing of businesses, and consumer protection. Voluntary standards go beyond these to suggest best practice and are usually coupled with training manuals for companies to make the necessary improvements to meet the requirements. Although certification of quality in hotels has a long tradition, it has focussed on environmental concerns only fairly recently, and is now starting to consider sociocultural issues. Most programmes have developed as bottom-up initiatives with little knowledge of each other and generally operate as specific responses to manage the key negative impacts or challenges of a particular subsector in a particular location. In the last 10 years, they have moved on dramatically to become one of the buzzwords of sustainable tourism and ecotourism, considered as a potential mechanism to combat greenwashing but not without a fair share of skeptics (Morris, 1997). This chapter will discuss the development of sustainability standards from local efforts to make business improvements to becoming part of the suite of governance and regulatory tools of the global tourism industry. The key propositions of this discussion are that standard setting and certification are valuable tools to bring stakeholders together in their sustainability efforts, and they can be part of a suite of tools to encourage improvement. At the same time it is necessary to proceed with caution and not take certification as the answer to greening the industry. This chapter outlines current developments in the sector to create a basis to critically understand and analyse key issues in the application of sustainability standards. This leads to the discussion of efforts to globalise standards, and the challenges encountered. Finally the chapter considers the range of stakeholders that can have an impact on developing standards, and hypothesises how the tourism industry could change through sustainability standard enforcement, considering both its feasibility and desirability.\nThe demand for ecotourism and outdoor recreation is increasing, and the pressures on land use are becoming more obvious. A large part of the experience of ecotourism and recreational landscape depends on the maintenance of forested land. Effective management of tourism and recreation in forests can provide extra income to help offset the costs of sustainable timber production and encourage biodiversity conservation. This multi-author book considers the compatibility between tourism, forestry and conservation, the management of natural resources and the involvement of stakeholders and the community. Issues are presented through case studies from a range of countries and topics covered include National Parks, peri-urban forestry and wilderness management, as well as practitioner-oriented contributions\nVolunteer tourism has been heavily criticised for its negative consequences on destinations and volunteers, often the direct result of unrealistic demand-led marketing and lack of consideration for the environmental and social costs of host communities. While some industry participants have responded through adherence to best practice, little information or support is available about how to responsibly market volunteer tourism. This research uses an online content analysis based on the International Voluntourism Guidelines for Commercial Operators to understand the use of responsibility as a market signalling tool. Five influential web pages of eight organisations are scored across 19 responsibility criteria and compared against the organisation\u2019s legal status, product type and price. We find that responsibility is not used for market signalling; preference is given to communicating what is easy, and not what is important. The status of the organisation is no guarantee of responsible practice, and price and responsibility communications display an inverse relationship. We conclude volunteer tourism operators are overpositioning and communicating responsibility inconsistently, which highlights greenwashing, requiring at least industry-wide codes of practice, and at best, regulation. This paper reflects on its methodological limitations, and on its practical achievements in encouraging change within some of the organisations examined.\nThe proliferation of schemes to certify sustainable tourism and ecotourism across the world has not succeeded in changing purchasing patterns and consumer behavior due to the global nature of the tourism industry, both in terms of supply and demand. Following the footsteps of industries such as forestry, organic farming and fishing, tourism is now the next target for a global accreditation body to regulate claims of sustainability. This article discusses the challenges of setting global sustainability standards in a diverse industry such as tourism, and the process followed by a team of consultants to encourage a wide representation of views and realities in developing an international accreditation body for sustainable tourism and ecotourism certifiers, the Sustainable Tourism Stewardship Council.\nGreenhushing selectively communicates fewer pro-sustainability actions by businesses than are practiced; based on a perception of customers\u2019 rights to consumerism. We first studied the gap between the communication of sustainability practices in the audits and websites of 31 small rural tourism businesses in the Peak District National Park (UK). The analysis showed that businesses only communicate 30% of all the sustainability actions practiced. Their websites emphasised customer benefits, using explicit, affective, experiential and active language that legitimises the customers\u2019 hedonistic use of the landscape, while downplaying complex issues and normalising sustainability to reduce customer guilt. Just one website mentioned climate change. We found that greenhushing results from a low moral intensity, masking potentially negative consequences of perceived lower competence, whilst protecting business from more cynical consumers who may interpret their statements as hypocritical. Subsequent textual analysis and interviews were used to understand how communication constitutes these organisations. We propose that greenhushing reshapes and constitutes tourism businesses through their communications. Moreover, greenhushing is a form of public moralisation that adopts communication practices similar to greenwashing, reflecting the social norms expected from a business; however, in this case, located in a moral muteness, rather than moral hypocrisy, that businesses accept but resent.\nEvaluating whether sustainability indicator schemes contribute to better sustainable destination management has proven challenging. We adopt a systems thinking approach to shed light on the elusive impacts of sustainable tourism indicator schemes. We conduct online participatory workshops with 19 experts in sustainable tourism monitoring, to produce a causal loop diagram that illustrates how destination systems behave when indicator schemes are implemented. The results show that until now, these schemes have been expected to follow utopian, evidence-based, policy pathways to change, but we now understand that this linear-thinking approach fails to recognize the complex interplay of factors that occur during implementation. We find that indicator schemes can spark a rich, yet unappreciated, series of conceptual, instrumental, and structural dynamics. We conclude that the hidden power of these schemes lies in their ability to foster dialog, stimulate learning, incentivize network development, challenge stakeholder worldviews, and steer systems change toward sustainable destination management.\nWhile the increasing number of tourism certification programmmes has allowed for bottom-up initiatives among local players involved with sustainable tourism efforts, in doing so, it has led to market confusion, and high start-up costs. In order to understand how to best set high standards for sustainable tourism and ecotourism certification programmmes around the world, and to make these programmmes widely beneficial, the Rainforest Alliance has spearheaded a feasibility study for a global tourism accreditation body, entitled the Sustainable Tourism Stewardship Council. \u00a9 2003 X. Font et al.\nThis article reports on the benchmarking of organizational structure, governance and finances of accreditation in a number of industries and certification programs in tourism, as part of the research on the feasibility and desirability of a Sustainable Tourism Stewardship Council. There are a variety of governance structures widely accepted and potentially transferable to new accreditation bodies, with the biggest changes coming in the form of outsourcing the accreditation function from standard setting and compliance with ISO guides. Financial benchmarking has shown great weaknesses in the sector, over-relying on seed funding from donors and the general inability of the sector to be self-financing, which casts a shadow over the long term survival of accreditation in its present form.

Latin American businesses were surveyed about their motivations for acting sustainably and any sustainability actions undertaken. Based on their responses, TwoStep cluster analysis found four clusters (cost, legitimisation, biospheric, and lifestyle). Acceptance of responsibility to be more sustainable depends on one\u2019s level of empathy with, and attachment to, sustainability, explained by a beneficiary focus (personal norms that drive one to act to help oneself or others) and a cultural focus (acting in response to individualistic or collectivistic social norms). Lifestyle businesses are argued to be culturally individualistic but self-transcendent in benefit focus.\nDrawing on social contagion theory, nudge theory and norm activation theory, this study investigates how residents' pro-environmental behaviour may influence tourists' behaviour, thus, collaboratively achieving a tourist destination's sustainability. Findings from a field experiment and three scenario experiments confirm that tourists have a stronger intention to behave pro-environmentally in those destinations where residents also display pro-environmental behaviour, and the tourists' perceptions of pro-environmental atmosphere mediates this effect. Furthermore, moral inspiration is found to be a mediating effect between perceived pro-environmental atmosphere and tourists' pro-environmental intentions, while the field cognitive style of tourists moderates this effect. These findings fill the research gap of social contagion theory in tourism and contribute to nudge theory on the mechanisms of encouraging pro-environmental behaviours. [Display omitted] \u2022Residents' displaying pro-environmental behaviours increase tourists' intentions.\u2022With nudge theory, explaining the mechanisms of pro-environmental contagion.\u2022Under norm activation theory, we design and interpret nudge.\u2022Field cognitive styles moderate the effect of nudge.\u2022Destinations should make residents' pro-environmental behaviours visible.\nThis article analyses the use of mixed methods in papers published in the Journal of Sustainable Tourism over the 10 years, 2005\u20132014. First, a content analysis of the articles shows that mixed methods are used primarily for expansion and development of results, and less often for triangulation or complementarity. Sequential designs are slightly more popular than simultaneous designs, with qualitative research preceding the quantitative element. In the majority of cases, both the quantitative and qualitative methods have equivalent importance, yet where one is dominant, this is usually the quantitative part. Second, we contextualise the content analysis by exemplifying the use of mixed methods in selected papers, using commentary from authors who have recently published mixed methods papers. We reflect on the reasons for, strengths and weaknesses of using mixed methods, and we argue that mixed methods provide sustainable tourism academics with more opportunities for pragmatic transformative research for societal change, and increasing research reliability in relation to social desirability bias, stakeholder comparisons and transdisciplinarity. The paper notes the need for greater understanding of mixed methods by researchers, its special value and growing importance in sustainable tourism research, and its challenges and strengths for authors and editors.\nThis research note outlines the results from a consultation exercise carried out by Tourfor, a European Commission project aiming to develop an ecolabel for forest-based recreation and tourism, based on implementing an environmental management system. The paper will first present the rationale of the project and then discuss the willingness of providers and agencies to apply for this ecolabel, perceived benefits, criteria, and the ecolabel management methods. The paper concludes that there is a critical mass of sites willing to apply for the ecolabel, and outlines suggestions from the respondents regarding the ecolabel.\nThis article presents a multi-criteria methodology to identify target markets for the hotel industry, based on objective and quantitative criteria from official statistical sources, using five dimensions: volume, evolution, seasonality, length of stay and expenditure. The methodology allows tourism organisations to: i) identify market indicators that respond to their organisational goals; ii) build a composite indicator that reveals the suitability of these markets; and iii) evaluate market segments based on their attractiveness and their market share. We test and illustrate the methodology using pre- and post-pandemic data for international tourism demand to Spain, illustrating the value of different target markets both for the country's hotel industry and for individual hoteliers. \u2022Hoteliers need to better understand the value of target markets to take informed decisions.\u2022We provide a viable tool to select tourism markets.\u2022A multicriteria criteria ranking is a comprehensive and objective tool to rank markets.\u2022Our index includes market volume, evolution, seasonality, length of stay, and expenditure.\u2022The index clearly captures market changes before and after covid-19.\nPurpose: This article examines the choices made by the hotel industry about what to include, and who to be accountable to, in their sustainability reports; a process defined as materiality assessment. Design/methodology/approach: The article is based on the findings of semi-structured interviews with: 1) eight sustainability managers (from eight of the world\u2019s 50 largest hotel groups) to explore their understanding of, and use of, materiality and any barriers to its uptake; and 2) eight industry sustainability experts to assess the general industrywide application of materiality. Findings: Sustainability managers from large hotel groups are evasive when disclosing their materiality criteria, their decision-making processes and how they aggregate stakeholder feedback; they limit their disclosure to the reporting process. Sustainability managers are disempowered, with limited resources, time, knowledge and skills to apply to materiality assessment. Experts confirm that hotel groups are unsystematic and opaque about their decision-making and how they control their materiality assessments. Practical implications: Materiality assessment is concealed from the public and may be constructed around business imperatives with high managerial capture. The hospitality industry needs to improve its sustainability reporting, by examining how it defines and applies materiality and by addressing the barriers identified, if it is to demonstrate an enduring commitment to sustainability and organisational legitimacy. Originality/value: This article addresses the limited knowledge of how hotel groups undertake materiality assessments. It identifies gaps in the conception and application of materiality by pinpointing barriers to its uptake and recommending areas in need of further research.\nThis chapter considers whether certifying (small- and medium-sized) tourism businesses for sustainability will contribute to greater consumer interest and build the market for ecotourism and sustainable tourism. The chapter reviews the literature on green consumer behaviour and sustainable tourism demand and the limited works available on the market for certified sustainable tourism. It also investigates key marketing challenges (as presented in the literature) in the green and sustainability marketplaces with respect to positioning, branding, business-to-business promotion and distribution. It is concluded that, while certification may be a valid method to involve businesses in quality and sustainability oversight of their businesses, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that certification of sustainable tourism will have market benefits, and that such benefits should not be used to justify government, NGO or donor support of tourism certification.\nPurpose This study examines the direct effect of outcome message frames (gain vs loss) on cause involvement and the moderating roles of consumers' corporate social responsibility (CSR) scepticism and biospheric values. Furthermore, the authors analyse (1) the effects of gain-framed messages on consumer attitudes towards an environmental cause (i.e. the use of reusable coffee cups) and towards the company promoting the cause (a coffee shop chain); (2) how consumer attitudes towards the cause affect their attitudes towards the company; and (3) how consumer attitudes towards both the cause and the company affect their behavioural intentions towards both the cause and the company. Design/methodology/approach Using a 2 x 1 scenario-based, experimental design with a gain vs loss stimuli, Study 1 (n = 466) examines the moderating effects of CSR scepticism and biospheric values on the relationship between message framing and consumer cause involvement. Using gain-framed stimuli, Study 2 (n = 958) analyses the effects of cause involvement variations on attitudes and behaviours, through structural equation modelling. Findings Gain-framed messages are more effective than loss-framed messages at increasing cause involvement in consumers. Both CSR scepticism and biospheric values moderate the relationship between gain-framed messages and cause involvement. Cause involvement enhances consumer attitudes towards both the cause and the company promoting it, while company attitudes towards a cause positively influence consumers' behavioural intentions. Originality/value This study recommends that environmental CSR advertising managers should use gain-framed messages to positively influence consumer cause involvement.\nDespite Volunteer Tourism (VT) being firmly rooted in sustainability, there is a lack of detailed understanding of how the VT supply chain influences sustainability. Specifically, while recent analytical frameworks evaluating relations in the VT supply chain have detected power imbalances amongst the main stakeholders, little is known about how and why the different active components of VT stakeholders\u2019 relations influence sustainability. Based on a case study of the four main stakeholders in VT (sending and receiving organizations, volunteers, and host projects), this paper illustrates the nuanced details of how collaborative relations within the supply chain can lead to sustainability. The study determines how and why VT organizations\u2019 values are the main drivers for the VT supply chain to achieve sustainability outcomes. It demonstrates how operationalising power-sharing and shared decision-making throughout the whole supply chain enables VT to improve sustainability performance. In the surveyed host projects, accumulative short-term outcomes (based on skills transfer and confidence building) can facilitate long-term transformative change such as social mobility.\nLinear logic models are insufficient to understand how interventions work in complex areas such as sustainable tourism. We present Participatory Systems Mapping (PSM), a novel method to develop shared understandings and collective management of complex policy issues among stakeholders. We use PSM with stakeholders in Barcelona to support the design of an upcoming evaluation of an existing sustainability programme. Discussion during workshops, and analysis of the PSM map produced, suggest sharing best practices and improving peer-to-peer learning are pivotal to improving sustainability. We show how a complex systems approach, implemented via PSM, can provide a more holistic understanding of the contexts and interactions of tourism policy. We offer learning and guidance on how the method can be used by others.\nWorkshop methodologies based on overarching knowledge structures are necessary for a shift of the tourism sector towards sustainability. We adopted a participatory action research approach and designed a workshop methodology based on the main tenets and tools of the theory of change, design thinking, and sustainable business models. We tested this methodology within a project initiated by a destination management organisation to promote innovation during the covid-19 crisis and used the results to identify improvements and recommendations for future applications. Although further tests are needed, the study proved that the developed methodology has great potential for promoting the systemic change, creativity, collaboration, empathy, and empowerment that are necessary for a sustainability shift.\nTo mainstream sustainability, we need to understand the value gained from sustainability by users. We apply a user-centred design methodology to develop an agile, iterative, incremental and reflexive process to understand the sustainability value proposition for Lufthansa City Center travel agents. We analyse the failure of sustainability communications within the online platforms used by these agents and explore why the agents factor out sustainability information during the customer sales process. We identify how agents and customers understand sustainability, and we explore opportunities to co-create sustainability value. Furthermore, we prototype, and then test, methods of empowering travel agents to communicate sustainability to their customers as a value-adding proposition.\nWithin the travel and tourism industry in Europe today there are some 5000 recipients of green certification logos, including a wide range of accommodations as well as tour operators, destinations, golf courses, parks, beaches, and marinas. As discussed in chapter 7, since the 1980s, scores of eco-sensitive certification programs in Europe were developed in a piecemeal fashion by a variety of government agencies, NGOs, and industry association to cover parts of the mass, sustainable, and ecotourism markets. Both the loose use of terminology and Europe\u2019s large number of small, sometimes overlapping, certification systems create customer and industry confusion.2 Most of the green certification schemes described in the previous chapter measure the environmental impacts or management of a tourism structure or business such as a lodge or tour operator. This chapter aims to demonstrate that certification programs that measure the quality of natural areas may be more likely to succeed than certification schemes of tourism facilities because they assess aspects of the environment that are more important to both long term sustainability and to the traveling public. This will be illustrated by examining two nature-based certification programs in Europe, the well-established Blue Flag for beaches and the World Wide Fund for Nature\u2019s PAN Parks program that is in its inception stages.\nThe use of ecolabels and certification schemes in the tourist industry is reviewed. Over 70 schemes are described, from the developed countries of the Northern Hemisphere and Australia. Ways for widening the applicability and hence validity of these ecolables are suggested in conclusion. The book is divided into an introductory section (Chapters 1-2) and four parts. Part 1 discusses the contexts of tourism ecolabels (Chapters 3-6). Part 2 presents the practical approach of ecolabels development (Chapters 7-12). Part 3 reviews the recent changes in ecolabels and their current developments (Chapters 13-15). A strategic analysis of tourism ecolabels is presented in Chapter 16. Part 4 presents a directory of current ecolabels. Ecolabels are viewed as marketing tools that promote good environmental performance. The book is indexed.\nEco-innovation is essential if we are to improve the environmental impacts of tourism firms. Building on the natural-resource-based view (NRBV) of the firm, we hypothesize that eco-innovation is the mediating factor between four firm-level antecedents (opportunity-recognizing and opportunity-capitalizing capabilities, top managers\u2019 attitudes and stakeholder pressures) and three outcomes (cost and differentiation, with respect to a firm\u2019s competitive advantage, and its resulting organizational performance). Partial least squares structural equation modelling is applied to the data from a survey with hotel managers in China, and confirms all of the hypotheses, except two, namely: i) that cost competitive advantage is positively related to hotel performance, and ii) that eco-innovation fully mediates the relationships between opportunity-recognizing capability and both dimensions of competitive advantage. Our contribution to the NRBV theory with a novel, integrated model to predict the mediating role that eco-innovation plays between firm-level resources and capabilities, and competitive advantages.\nNon-compliance with social distancing (SD) measures clearly has negative effects on both public health and post-pandemic economic recovery. However, little is as yet known about people\u2019s views on and factors influencing their behavioral intentions toward SD measures. This study draws on moral disengagement theory and the norm-activation model to investigate mechanisms that promote or hinder compliance with SD measures. A longitudinal research approach was adopted to compare changes in the main factors over three periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in England (UK). The results reveal significant differences between the three periods regarding intentions to comply with SD measures, altruistic value, moral obligation and moral disengagement, with no significant change in ascription of responsibility. Residents showed had the strongest intentions to comply with SD measures during the first national lockdown, with the highest moral obligation and lowest moral disengagement levels, compared with the lowest intention to comply during the first re-opening period. Altruistic value is important in promoting moral obligation and compliance with SD measures, whereas the predictive powers of ascription of responsibility and moral disengagement were weaker than expected. These findings offer guidance to policymakers and researchers in developing more effective policies and public communication strategies. The results suggest that communication is key to normalizing SD compliance, which can be achieved most effectively by fostering residents\u2019 altruistic value and moral considerations. Particular attention must be paid to re-opening periods between lockdowns, with clear messages to remind residents of prosocial aspects of SD compliance and public health. In addition to appropriate communication and education, technologies such as apps, QR codes and contactless shopping settings may also be used to facilitate compliance with SD measures.\nThe outcomes of volunteer tourism have rarely evaluated, and the sustainable practices, such as equality within this sector, are questionable. Extant research has indicated that miscommunication and poor volunteer placement management can lead to ineffectiveness and negative experiences for stakeholders such as host project staff and volunteers. Collaborative relations between the main stakeholders at a local level were evaluated and deconstructed to enable a better understanding of operational practices that influence sustainable outcomes for host projects. This evaluative study examined the role of the receiving organisation at the host destination in achieving sustainable outcomes utilising a case study in South Africa. An evaluative framework integrating realistic evaluation, collaboration theory and supply chain analysis offered in-depth insights into why the local contextual settings influence how collaborative relations among stakeholders can influence sustainable outcomes. The receiving organisation\u2019s knowledge of the local socio-economic contextual settings of each host project is critical to the successful engagement between hosts and volunteers which leads to equality. The evaluative framework offers an understanding of how and why the local contextual settings and the prosocial approach by the local agent are essential in enabling sustainability performance in volunteer tourism.\nCreating Shared Value hinges on the interdependence between a company\u2019s success and social welfare, and also the identification and expansion of connections between that company and society. Because critics say the concept is counterproductive, in that it focuses too narrowly on the company\u2019s economic value creation, we take a materiality analysis approach of corporate social responsibility (CSR). This approach provides evidence of what is important to stakeholders and promotes meaningful corporate disclosure, central to the Global Reporting Initiative. This study reports on a materiality analysis of the cruise industry, comparing stakeholder concerns/demands with both the relevant literature and existing CSR reports to determine to what extent the current industry definition of its social responsibility matches the expectations of its stakeholders, and subsequently, to theorise reasons for the patterns found. Results evidence that cruise companies tend to both over-report immaterial issues and under-report material issues, without responding to stakeholders\u2019 requests.\nThe context and nature of PAN Parks Tourism is one of the largest sectors in Europe, and has the potential to become a key element of the preservation of rural European landscapes and social structures, through the regeneration of economically depleted areas with the economic input of tourism. Although coastal and city tourism are still the highest in terms of visitors numbers, it is rural and mountain tourism that is growing fast in the European context, and this is mostly around protected areas. The IUCN (1994; in Blangy & Vautier, 2001) lists four reasons why the nineties have offered increased opportunities for protected areas, all of which apply to Europe: \u2022 Human populations are relatively stable and affluent; \u2022 There are declining pressures on land in many areas because of agricultural surpluses and reduced military activity; \u2022 There is a high level of public support for conservation, and \u2022 There is a climate of international cooperation Therefore the threat on protected areas in Europe has diminished in some aspects such as resource extraction and agriculture, some of the greatest threats in other regions (WWF, 2000), yet increased in aspects such as land use pressures due to limited land availability. Tourism and recreation are one of the greatest contributors to land use pressure in Europe\u2019s national parks (FNNPE, 1993), yet despite being a threat, it is also one of the key levers for the preservation of Europe\u2019s remaining wilderness areas (Font & Tribe, 2000).\nManagement of environmental impacts is a key requisite to achieve sustainable tourism and recreation; and Environmental Management Systems (EMSs) provide the framework to assess, plan, act upon, control and monitor environmental management and performance. Although a large proportion of tourism and recreation sites would be in a position to work towards an EMS, few of them are aware of what they need to do to implement such systems. This case study analyses to what extent the elements of an EMS are present in the current management of a Forest Enterprise site in the UK providing outdoor recreation, promoting nature conservation and producing timber. This paper demonstrates how an EMS can be applied to put a structure to the management of a multi-purpose site, and concludes that this site, representative of other Forest Enterprise sites, can meet the basic demands of an EMS.\nMessages with a clear focus on personal benefits and social and personal norms could impact holidaymakers' preferences towards opting for sustainability actions. This argument was explored using a three stage, sequential, mixed methods study. Firstly, analysis of current sustainability messages from three responsible tour operators revealed a low likelihood of them influencingcustomer preferences towards sustainability actions. An online survey of consumer beliefs and values proved that a manipulated message was more persuasive than the real messages used by the tour operators. This informed an experiment in message design that showed preferences for: i) obtaining individual gains from acting pro-sustainability (the importance of self-benefit), ii) doing what others are doing (the appeal of conforming to the descriptive norm), and iii) doing what others think one should do (the appeal of conforming to the injunctive norm). The findings have led the ANVR to relaunch their sustainability programme, focusing on customer benefits.\nSustainable Tourism as a Competitive Tool in Chile. This paper reviews the Chilean tourism planning taking place to develop and promote sustainability among tourism entrepreneurs in order to develop, position and promote itself as a sustainable tourism destination. This article frames this policy of market-based instruments in ecological modernisation theory, and then outlines in detail the information evaluated, the institutions involved, the processes and organs established and the development path taken. The article suggests some lessons learned from this process for other destinations in the form of critical factors that enable this process and give greater assurance to ensure that policies, plans and programs are successful and endure over time.\nThis paper develops a methodology for the early detection of reactivation of tourist markets to help mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 crisis, using Skyscanner data on air passenger searches (>5,000 million) and picks (>600 million), for flights between November 2018 and December 2020, through ForwardKeys. For future travel during the May to September 2020 period, the desire to travel (based on the number of flight searches) has dropped by about 30% in Europe and the Americas, and by about 50% in Asia, while intention to travel (the number of flight picks, the final selections amongst flight searches) has dropped a further 10-20%. Most source markets remain optimistic about air travel during the last quarter of 2020, suggesting a U shape recovery. However, optimism has dwindled as time passes, suggesting a flatline L shape. A traffic light dashboard for domestic and inbound air travel demand to Spain shows how destination managers might use Big Data relating to the early recovery of key source markets to develop targeted marketing strategies. We show how Big Data provides timely granular data essential in highly volatile situations, and we argue that destination management organisations must improve their Big Data analytical and evidence-based, decision-making skills.\nPrograms to certify \"green\" or sustainable tourism standards are rapidly growing, and it is possible that certification might change in function and effect from awarding excellence to becoming de facto requirements to trade. Because certification often relies on governmental support, it could be perceived as an anti-competitive barrier to trade in the context of international practice such as the General Agreement on Trade in Services, which could reduce the appeal of standards as a self-regulatory method. This paper provides a pro-sustainability standards reading of the agreement and related World Trade Organization documents to discuss what policies and practices might be criticized as trade-restrictive and provides arguments against such criticisms. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This article reviews how sustainability systems are being challenged by organizational habit and perceptions rather than analytical decision-making with respect to the relationship between health and safety, quality and sustainability. Environmental indicators are identified as the most conflictive; the key findings demonstrate that most challenges require a change in human behaviour rather than a technical solution. The data suggests that tour operators need to develop sustainability auditing tools that consider the impacts upon health, safety and quality within the accommodations. The Travelife sustainability auditing system provides a useful case study to demonstrate the necessary requirement for a complementary approach when conducting accommodations audits.\nPrevious research explains the various factors that motivate or discourage the owner-managers of small firms to behave sustainably. However, it has failed to develop a meaningful understanding of how these factors inter-relate or combine to influence their decisions. This research identifies and explains how socio-cultural and industrial norms influence the intentions and behaviours towards sustainability of owner-managers of small tourism firms. This grounded theory study shows how selective peer association allows the use of norms that match one's values to predict the difficulties, benefits and therefore justification for pro-sustainability (in)action. Locally-held socio-cultural norms determine what is commonly (dis)approved of through reflective and comparative processes. Connectedness to the locality triggers empathy for nature and the local society, but not a corresponding sense of responsibility. This dissonance is managed by allocating responsibility to industry actors perceived as more powerful, particularly tour operators and consumers, and to the widespread greed and short term culture dominating the sector.\nThis paper examines the reasons for different levels of environmental engagement among small firms in tourism. Drawing on theories of motivation, notably Social Cognitive Theory, Motivation Systems Theory and Goal Orientation Theory, as well as the literature on environmental sensitivity, it proposes a novel conceptual framework that is subsequently used to inform an empirical study. The findings of the research suggest that varying levels of environmental engagement may be explained by differences in worldviews, self-efficacy beliefs, context beliefs and goal orientation. The paper concludes by considering the policy implications of the results.\nThis article reviews the procedural complexity of tourism policy-making by the European Commission leading up to the 2010 Communication. Initially, the European Commission had to present interventions affecting tourism as a community action or measure; intended to assist in the implementation of the Internal Market. Later, integration of the sustainable development principle into European Treaties established a framework for governance and a foundation for tourism policy, and the Lisbon Treaty in 2007 established a European policy that explicitly related to tourism, albeit a complementary competence in character. This article highlights a lack of leadership from the Member States throughout the process and contrasts this with the self-serving, driving force of the Commission in making tourism policy that focuses primarily on promotional actions. Consequently, the Commission has not created a robust, dynamic, flexible European model for tourism, designed in a way to best serve the needs of the Member States.\nThis article proposes that reactance theory can be used to better understand how tourists\u2019 perceptions of climate change affect their travel decisions. Reactance theory explains how individuals value their perceived freedom to make choices, and why they react negatively to any threats to their freedom. We study the psychological consequences of threatening tourist's freedoms, using a range of projective techniques: directly, using photo-expression, and indirectly, through collage, photo-interviewing and scenarios. We find that reactance theory helps to explain the extent of travel to two destinations: Svalbard and Venice, providing a nuanced understanding of how travellers restore their freedom to travel through three incremental stages: denying the climate change threat, reducing tensions arising from travel and heightening demand particularly for the most visibly threatened destinations. The theory suggests a fourth stage, helplessness, reached when consumers dismiss the value of destinations once they can no longer be enjoyed, but for which we, as yet, have no data. Reactance theory questions the validity of awareness-raising campaigns as behavioural change vehicles, provides alternative explanations of why the most self-proclaimed, environmentally aware individuals travel frequently, and helps identify nuanced, socially acceptable forms of sustainability marketing, capable of reducing resistance to change.\nThis study explores destination stakeholders\u2019 perceptions of volunteer tourism (VT) using equity theory. In this paper, 26 semi-structured interviews were conducted to understand individuals\u2019 needs, motivations, expectations and their assessments of inputs and outcomes. Equity theory sheds light on the micro-level of interaction between residents and volunteers and demonstrates why and how residents of Cusco (Peru) with an active role in VT develop certain perceptions in direct encounters with volunteer tourists. The data reveal how perceptions differ according to the respondents\u2019 social roles within VT. Heterogeneity, dynamism and a fluctuation between materialities and affection are discussed as important outcomes of these interactions.\nThis article studies the determinants of altruistic behaviour in a collectivistic country. A focus group discussion identified the determinants and their causal relationships. Partial least square and covariance-based structural equation modelling provide similar results in 605 questionnaires, which support the model\u2019s fit. The tourists are likely to perform more altruistic behaviours if they are exposed to persuasive communication that enhances self-efficacy beliefs, more than communication tapping into one\u2019s sustainability attitudes. The study shows the potential of focusing on altruistic messages in a collectivistic country (Bangladesh) in comparison to the individualistic messages typically shown to be more persuasive in Western countries. Keywords: Altruistic tourist behaviour, persuasive communication, attitude, self-efficacy belief, structural equation modelling, collectivism.\nWhat is the purpose of a tourism journal specialising in sustainability, and how does it best serve the needs of knowledge development, academia and wider society? Now that the Journal of Sustainable Tourism (JoST) is over 30 years old, and we've recently had a change in the editorial team, we thought it would be timely to consult with the editorial board to refresh and renew our aims and long-term outcomes, and ensure that our activities and use of resources are aligned with delivering outputs that will head us in the right direction. Editorial board members were invited to shape the ambitions and directions of the journal. We agreed that JoST aims to be a leading knowledge vehicle, theoretically rigorous yet solution-oriented, transformational journal, that contributes to solve the sustainability needs of society, with accumulated, developed, rapid and relevant knowledge that reaches beyond academia.\nA hometown is the place to which an individual has an affective bond resulting from either being born there or living there for lived for a long time. This article investigates people's intention to support the revival of tourism in their hometowns post-COVID-19. The research hypothesises that individuals are affected by the threat to ontological security, freedom of movement, and freedom of information, and this synthetic threat will affect their intention to support their hometown. Based on compensatory control theory and psychological reactance theory, the study investigates how the need to belong, combined with psychological reactance, reveals the underlying mechanisms of perceived threat on intention to support one's hometown. The survey responses from 658 residents in China were analysed using a structural equation model. The results showed that the perceived threat has a positive effect on intention to support one's hometown and need to belong mediates that relationship. Instead, despite perceived threat to their freedom, residents did not report psychological reactance when faced with hometown appeals. These results could help destinations to revive in the post-pandemic era; destination management organisations, especially in China, should be able to appeal to residents for promotional support without expecting psychological reactance.\nWe study the formation of pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs) by integrating both the promoting (moral obligation) and inhibiting (moral disengagement) PEB mechanisms. Results of a sample of 285 tourists at a National Nature Reserve in China affirm that moral obligation positively affects PEB intention, while moral disengagement has significant negative impact. There is little difference in the relative importance of moral obligation and moral disengagement in affecting PEB intention. Social influence plays an important role in regulating the impacts of moral variables on PEB intentions. This study also broadens knowledge of the structure of PEB, by unveiling low-effort PEB intention as a precursor to high-effort PEB intention, and a mediator between moral obligation / moral disengagement and high-effort PEB intention. This study provides insights and implications for tourism practitioners and policy makers, and opens up future research exploration of the paradox of the promoting and inhibiting PEB mechanisms.\nIn this editorial, we reflect on how the Journal of Sustainable Tourism can contribute towards sustainable tourism researchers achieving more impact with their research. We propose some changes that can be tested in, and introduced gradually and collaboratively with, the community of the editorial board and authors. To support impactful mind sets, we will promote research that reflects diverse academic communities. To promote impactful research topics, we will encourage authors to frame their submitted articles against the Sustainable Development Goals, while research that is time sensitive will be fast tracked so it can contribute to current debates. To promote impactful methodologies, we shall favour articles that use mixed methods and action research, and those that conduct longitudinal, experimental, and evaluative research. To promote impactful partnerships, we will favour multidisciplinary approaches and research that has been co-created with stakeholders. To promote impactful communication and dissemination, we will continue to build an online community on social media for sustainable tourism researchers, we will promote articles in social media to raise their visibility, and we will provide free access to those articles that are deemed to have the greatest potential to impact positively on society.\nDrawing on Taylor and Todd\u2019s \u201cdecomposed theory of planned behavior,\u201d this study explores the sustainability beliefs, attitudes, social norms, perceived behavioral controls, and behavioral intentions of accommodation managers and considers how these relate to their uptake of water-related innovations. An online survey is used to capture data from more than 300 accommodation establishments located in Catalonia (Spain). Using a structural equation model to interpret the data, 17 hypotheses are established, of which 15 are found to be significant. The findings show how the second-order constructs informed by organizational innovation literature explain the attitudes, social norms, and perceived behavioral controls of the managers; these factors inform 56% of the sustainability behavioral intentions. We explore the cognitive mechanisms that motivate managers to introduce sustainability practices in their businesses. We contribute to theory by demonstrating the benefits of studying the belief structures that inform taking sustainability actions from the perspective of innovation\nThis paper develops a methodology for the early detection of reactivation of tourist markets to help mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 crisis, using Skyscanner data on air passenger searches (>5,000 million) and picks (>600 million), for flights between November 2018 and December 2020, through ForwardKeys. For future travel during the May to September 2020 period, the desire to travel (based on the number of flight searches) has dropped by about 30% in Europe and the Americas, and by about 50% in Asia, while intention to travel (the number of flight picks, the final selections amongst flight searches) has dropped a further 10-20%. Most source markets remain optimistic about air travel during the last quarter of 2020, suggesting a U shape recovery. However, optimism has dwindled as time passes, suggesting a flatline L shape. A traffic light dashboard for domestic and inbound air travel demand to Spain shows how destination managers might use Big Data relating to the early recovery of key source markets to develop targeted marketing strategies. We show how Big Data provides timely granular data essential in highly volatile situations, and we argue that destination management organisations must improve their Big Data analytical and evidence-based, decision-making skills.\nWhile recent research on sustainability communication demonstrates the relevance of message framing, research on the effects of message framing on consumers' emotions is scant. Using the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework, this paper examines the impact of environmental advertisements (stimuli) on two discrete emotions - hope and guilt - (organism) and how these emotions influence consumers' behavioral intentions (responses). Relying on the prospect theory, this study focuses on positive (gain) and negative (loss) frames. Study 1 shows that, in the context of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), a gain message elicits hope while a loss-message triggers guilt. Study 2 shows that both emotions positively influence consumers' attitudes toward the cause; however, only hope affects attitude toward the company. Attitudes toward the cause and the company, in turn, influence consumers' behavioral intentions.\u867d\u7136\u6700\u8fd1\u5173\u4e8e\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5173\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u60c5\u7eea\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5374\u5f88\u5c11. \u5229\u7528\u523a\u6fc0-\u6709\u673a\u4f53\u53cd\u5e94 (S-O-R) \u6846\u67b6, \u672c\u6587\u8003\u5bdf\u4e86\u73af\u5883\u5e7f\u544a (\u523a\u6fc0) \u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u79bb\u6563\u60c5\u7eea--\u5e0c\u671b\u548c\u5185\u759a (\u6709\u673a\u4f53) \u7684\u5f71\u54cd, \u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u60c5\u7eea\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u610f\u56fe (\u53cd\u5e94). \u57fa\u4e8e\u524d\u666f\u7406\u8bba, \u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6b63 (\u589e\u76ca) \u548c\u8d1f (\u635f\u8017) \u5e27. \u7814\u7a761\u8868\u660e, \u5728\u4f01\u4e1a\u793e\u4f1a\u8d23\u4efb (CSR) \u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b, \u6536\u76ca\u4fe1\u606f\u5f15\u53d1\u5e0c\u671b, \u800c\u635f\u5931\u4fe1\u606f\u5f15\u53d1\u5185\u759a. \u7814\u7a762\u8868\u660e, \u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u7eea\u90fd\u4f1a\u79ef\u6781\u5f71\u54cd\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u5bf9\u539f\u56e0\u7684\u6001\u5ea6; \u7136\u800c, \u53ea\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6001\u5ea6. \u5bf9\u4e8b\u4e1a\u548c\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6001\u5ea6\u53cd\u8fc7\u6765\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u610f\u56fe.\nAs increased stakeholder pressure requires companies to be transparent about their CSR practices, it is essential to know how reliable corporate disclosure mechanisms are, testing the gap between corporate social responsibility claims and actual practice. This study benchmarks corporate social responsibility policies and practices of ten international hotel groups of particular importance to the European leisure market. We found that corporate systems are not necessarily reflective of actual operations, environmental performance is eco-savings driven, labour policies aim to comply with local legislation, socio-economic policies are inward looking with little acceptance of impacts on the destination, and customer engagement is limited. Generally larger hotel groups have more comprehensive policies but also greater gaps in implementation, while the smaller hotel groups focus only on environmental management and deliver what they promised. As the first survey of its kind in tourism, both the methodology and the findings have implications for further research.\nThis chapter reflects on the ability of PAN (Protected Area Network) Parks to deliver the expected benefits of certification to both national parks and stakeholder tourism businesses in Europe. The anticipated benefits included an improvement of the product through better management and an increased volume of business from certification branding and marketing. It is indicated that while both certified and applicant PAN parks report a range of benefits, there is an equally long list of challenges and costs that parks face both to behave in a more sustainable way and to prove this to PAN Parks for verification purposes. The chapter discusses the feasibility of providing benefits through working towards meeting the criteria and verification requirements.\nSustainable supply chain management (SSCM) encapsulates the trend to use purchasing policies and practices to facilitate sustainable development at the tourist destination. Most research has focused on environmental aspects of manufacturing, while other aspects of sustainability or the challenges for the service sector are largely ignored. Yet SSCM is particularly important for tour operators, as the product depends on the activities of suppliers, such as accommodation, transport and activities. Therefore, tour operators' contribution to sustainable tourism will be more effective through the definition and implementation of policies that acknowledge responsibility for the impacts of suppliers. Exploratory research of SSCM practices amongst tour operators generated a wide range of examples of good practice across the whole supply chain, and recommendations are made for more widespread engagement."

      "text": "Between colonization in the 1770s and the 1980s the staple of the Seychelles economy was plantation agriculture; spices such as cinnamon, coconut as well as tobacco, and food crops were grown. By the early 20th Century the plantations extended over most of the land mass of the Seychelles, the native forests had largely been obliterated. .The problems were compounded by the introduction of alien predators, collection of animals for food, mining of guano and in the latter 20th Century the applications of pesticides. Under these multiple assaults many native species populations became rare, fragmented or extinct.\nEconomic changes over the last three decades have coincided with more enlightened views: over the 1970s and 1980s the plantations became unprofitable and have mostly been abandoned; this coincided with the start of tourism, which has provided\n|\n|\nsustainable funding for islands managing their biodiversity sensitively. The result has been that the Seychelles, despite being one of the smallest countries is a world leader in environmental restoration. Restoration or rehabilitation has been conducted on a number of the islands, and typically involves several stages:\n- The removal of alien predators such as rats\n- The control or removal of alien plants and replacement with native species\n- The reintroduction of native animals\nThe island restoration programme initiated in 1999, initially under a GEF MSP-Management of Avian Ecosystems- in the Seychelles points the way to sustainable mechanisms of island restoration. A collaborative effort between Nature Seychelles, private island owners and the Seychelles Government, the program is ongoing. Components include biological assessment of islands, cost analysis of restoration and maintenance, education and awareness, island management plans, removal of alien predators and other invasive alien species, establishment or rehabilitation of native coastal habitats, translocation of globally threatened endemic species and socio-economic valuation of restored ecosystems and ecotourism,. Islands in the programme include Fr\u00e9gate, Cousine, North and Denis Islands, private 5 -star hotel resorts. Establishment of new populations of endangered species will not only lead to down grading of the threat status of these species on the IUCN Red List but also to enhancing ecotourism potential thus inducing hotel owners to contribute to conservation efforts. The program has been financed by the GEF, the Seychelles government and island owners and has involved international partners such as BirdLife International.\nBiodiversity management has developed immensely in the last 30 years, now standard procedures have been developed to remove alien species, rehabilitate native forest and re-introduce native species. Nature Seychelles has published biological assessments of many Seychelles islands as well developing a manual of assessment methods. The organisation has also published several papers on the subject including methods of eradicating Mynah birds.\nThe removal of rats is a prerequisite for restoration, and the methods first developed in New Zealand have been refined for the Seychelles climate and conditions. The process involves the application of a poison in a cereal based carrier pellet to all parts of the island. This can be done on foot, by placing bait on a 25 metre grid across an island on flat islands or by spreading the bait from a helicopter on large or rocky islands. To date three islands have been successfully cleared of rats: Fr\u00e9gate Island Private, Bird Island and Denis Island. Several others have been cleared of cats.\nForest restoration has also been carried out on several islands since Cousin was restored, Cousine and Aride have both had successful forest recovery programmes, removing alien species, constructing and stocking a nursery and replanting with native trees.\nThe final element is the re-introduction of native species, to date mainly birds. Several species have been reintroduced to restored islands in planned programmes in recent years: the Seychelles magpie robin has been reintroduced to three islands, the Seychelles warbler to three and the Seychelles fody to two. Re-introduction should not be taken lightly, a thorough understanding of the species ecology and hence suitability of the islands is needed. Birds are the best studied taxon, and hence have been reintroduced first, but as research and interest in restoration increase, reintroduction of other groups such as reptiles and insects seems likely in the near future.\nCousin, the first restored ecosystem\nCousin was acquired for conservation in 1969; at the time it was managed as a coconut plantation. The primary motive for the purchase of Cousin was that it held the last population of the Seychelles warbler, numbering about thirty birds that were largely restricted to the mangrove woodland, the last fragment of native forest. Early management was low key; the most important action was to collect coconuts that had fallen to the ground. This prevented the growth of a dense under-story of young palms that would prevent native plants from growing.\nWith the coconut under control the native trees began to regenerate, one of the most abundant being Pisonia grandis (Mapou in kreol), the sticky seeds being spread on the plumage of seabirds. Other trees that prevailed in small numbers have also recovered. In the early 1990s most of the remaining coconuts palms were removed and now the vast majority of the vegetation is native.\nCousin was one of the few islands that remained free of rats and mice, and hence cats were never introduced to control them. With the recovering forest and absence of alien predators native animals flourished. The Seychelles warbler population increased 10 fold, colonies of seabirds expanded greatly, and the endemic skinks and Bronze eyed gecko occur at high densities. A small number of Seychelles Magpie robins were introduced in the mid 1990s; there is now a thriving population of 30 birds.\nRestoring whole island ecosystems on Denis Island: A private sector and NGO collaboration\nDenis island has seen extensive environmental disturbance in the past, with removal of guano and creation of a coconut plantation over most of the island. Pesticides have been used in the past and the island was infested with mice and rats. Like many islands in the Seychelles its flora and fauna consisted mostly of alien species. The island owners have been desirous for some time to restore Denis to its natural state.\nIn 1999 the island management agreed on a joint program with Nature Seychelles which has proven expertise in species rehabilitation and island restoration. Denis Island management funded the eradication of rats and mice in 2000 and 2002. Nature Seychelles through a World Bank GEF project has undertaken a complete biological assessment of the island, cost analysis of restoration and maintenance, an island management plan and planting of native trees. It has undertaken the translocation of globally threatened endemic species.\nThe aim of the habitat management was to promote a more extensive high-canopy forest of native tree species which provide plenty of invertebrate food for birds and other endemic wildlife. The first stage of the habitat management by Nature Seychelles\u2019 island assessment and restoration teams involved the removal of hundreds of coconut palms, most of which were self-sown plants from the original plantation palms, from around thirty hectares of woodland. In places these palms grew so thickly as to exclude all other vegetation.\nA nursery was established by Nature Seychelles to provide about 2000 young trees of various native species for planting out. The second phase of work by the team was the planting of these saplings in the areas cleared of coconut growth. With additional natural regeneration, all the woodland areas should begin to fill with native trees in a few years time.\nDenis Island now has no introduced predators: during this project, two cats (apparently the last individuals on the island) were killed, and the population of Mynah birds was considerably reduced. Unfortunately, despite an eradication attempt by the island management in 2000 black rats were once again on the island. However, in 2002 another eradication was successful.\nTwo rare species of Seychelles birds the Seychelles Warbler and the Seychelles Fody were transferred by Nature Seychelles to Denis in 2004 and these are successfully breeding.\nSince 2002, Denis island management pays for a permanent conservation officer. The officer undertakes measures to guarantee that rodents do not re-invade the island and has ensured that dangerous pesticides have been phased out and practices on the island are compatible with conservation. It is hoped the full potential of the island will be realised when the native habitats fill most of the island and other endemic wildlife is established."

CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.\nSquaring our urge to see the world with the need to ease the impact of flights on the planet is now a major concern among top travel companies.\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, flights account for at least 2% of all global carbon emissions, with the sector\u2019s impact growing faster than road, shipping and rail.\nWith a 2017 EU study showing that 85% of programs to offset planet-warming emissions from air travel do not work, pioneering operators are now looking towards a new approach, advising those who want to go on long-haul trips to take fewer of them and to stay for longer when they do.\nUK-based operator Responsible Travel advises travelers to take this approach, saying it screens its vacations to ensure they reach high conservation standards and respect local cultural heritage.\nNatucate\u2019s North Island sabbatical\nIn the Seychelles one company, Natucate, is taking this to the next level. Operating on the archipelago\u2019s North Island, its dedicated conservation trips are aimed at people taking sabbaticals or looking to maximize their entire vacation allowance.\nThese trips can last between 26 and 52 days, with the chance to do work to protect native turtle populations and giant tortoises, teaming up with small non-government organizations, or NGOs, on the ground who have the expertise to educate visitors and ground them in the world of conservation.\n\u201cThe trend we are seeing is that people will maybe use more holidays in one go, then only do one international flight every two years, but then stay much longer,\u201d says Daniel Kaul, CEO of Natucate.\nKaul began Natucate 10 years ago, having spent time as a university student volunteering in various National Parks across the United States. Keen to move into conservation tourism and change his career, he wanted others to experience what he had and learn about nature firsthand.\nHe says the trend towards longer trips has multiple benefits for all parties.\n\u201cWe see that people want to stay longer and have a more conscious impact on conservation and to understand the conservation work we are doing better. They prefer this to coming for seven days and hurrying,\u201d he says.\n\u201cTheir contribution over a long time is needed by the NGO and, of course, they learn how the product works, learn how to work independently, and the whole project benefits.\u201d\nHowever, such long trips also have a positive long-term impact away from the Seychelles.\n\u201cIt\u2019s helping to spread the word about conservation,\u201d says Kaul. \u201cWe have people who come back from a long sabbatical and they run a donation event and collect funding for those conservation projects. But we also see people engage with NGOs back home and think about wildlife or nature conservation and what you can do in your neighborhood. You can do something for biodiversity in your garden. And that\u2019s definitely an outcome many of our clients tell us about.\u201d\nTurtles, tortoises and trees\nOn North Island itself, a private island northwest of the main Seychelles island of Mah\u00e9, Natucate\u2019s clients can participate in long-form conservation and gain a greater understanding of the region\u2019s biodiversity.\n\u201cWe send people there for longer periods of eight or more weeks to assist the research team and scientists on the island,\u201d explains Kaul. \u201cAnd we do monitoring of green turtles, Hawksbill turtles, which include daily beach patrols. Sometimes we need to move nests a bit more towards the island so that they don\u2019t get affected by the water.\u201d\nVisitors also assist in taking GPS locations of giant tortoises on the island, ensuring they remain protected, with their whereabouts known. But it isn\u2019t just about the fauna. Kaul is keen to emphasize that the work Natucate does in the Seychelles is holistic too.\n\u201cWe want to help endemic vegetation,\u201d he says.\nThat involves removing alien vegetation and planting native trees.\n\u201cWe planted trees which should be there, because this island used to be a coconut area.\u201d\nIn the water, clients and scientists work together to identify and track fish and other marine species, ensuring the health of the ocean remains a top priority.\nA growing travel trend\nThe concept of the sabbatical, though, is clearly what drives this Natucate project on North Island. And it\u2019s a growing trend. Payroll processing company Gusto found that 6% of US employees took a sabbatical in January 2022, double the number in January 2019.\nThis, they say, is linked to a wider understanding of burnout and the wish to put personal needs ahead of ambition in the wake of the pandemic.\n\u201cOne hundred percent,\u201d says Kaul when asked if he\u2019s noticed the urge for longer breaks following Covid.\n\u201cWe see so many people who are just desperate to rest their brains. They want to go to the wilderness and to stay as remote as possible. They want to do something good and conscious. And just enjoy nature. People want to do a conscious conservation sabbatical with us just to get a break from normal life.\u201d\nKaul says that in the time since restrictions have eased, there has been a noticeable demographic shift in those taking such long breaks.\n\u201cIt used to be much younger and would typically be gap year students or students coming immediately after they finish school,\u201d he says. \u201cNow the average age of our clients is older than 35. Seventy percent are female and a lot of them are taking a long sabbatical.\u201d\nKaul says that one client stayed with them for 16 months working on a conservation project. It\u2019s clear that a slower, more mindful take on travel is emerging on North Island.\nBig tourism comes on board\nNatucate\u2019s work has clearly helped lead the change. And, says Kaul, he is pleased with the direction of travel in the wider tourism sector when it comes to interacting with the natural world.\n\u201cWe are seeing a massive trend that even the big tourism companies and I don\u2019t say this negatively are looking into sustainability and are looking into conservation. They\u2019re saying \u2018We can actually create a code of conduct for how to swim with whale sharks\u2019 or telling visitors not to do elephant activities in Thailand, for example. I see a lot of movement there.\u201d\nNatucate\u2019s efforts in the Seychelles perhaps point towards a healthier way for us all to travel. In a world where fast-paced, short trips are losing their allure, this slower, more mindful way of doing things looks set to have a future."
