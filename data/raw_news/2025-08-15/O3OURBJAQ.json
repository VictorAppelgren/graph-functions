If not, type it in manually.\n\u2022 Agree to the bonus offer terms and verify your age.\n\u2022 Deposit $10 or more and place a $10+ wager on any sport\n\nWhile the welcome offer promo code can only be used once by new BetMGM users, there are many other ongoing promos for existing customers. And if you live in a state where BetMGM also offers casino play, you may also qualify for BetMGM casino bonus code offers, as well as bonuses that can be obtained through online poker or racebook wagers. It is one of the top online casinos.\n\nHere are the top BetMGM sportsbook offers for current customers:\n\u2022 Parlay plus: Increases payouts for 4- to 7-leg parlays.\n\u2022 Parlay insurance: Get a bonus bet refund if one leg of your parlay loses (typically capped at $25).\n\u2022 Known as Lion\u2019s Boosts, these daily enhanced odds apply to top games and events.\n\u2022 Viewable from the app or site\u2019s top banner.\n\u2022 Choose your favorite NFL or NBA team and receive team-specific promos and odds boosts.\n\u2022 Get a $100 bonus when your friend signs up via your referral link and meets requirements.\n\nAll BetMGM users are automatically enrolled in BetMGM rewards program known as MGM Rewards. You earn points through real-money bets and by visiting MGM Resorts properties.\n\nYou can use the BetMGM sportsbook bonus code first-bet offer on any sports betting market. Once you have placed that initial wager, you will then find sport-specific BetMGM sportsbook promos available each season.\n\nThe NFL is the most popular sports betting market, so through the years, BetMGM Sportsbook has offered a multitude of valuable football betting promos to those sports bettors, making it one of the top NFL betting apps.\n\nThis list of NFL betting promos includes items such as odds boosts, parlay boosts, parlay insurance (both for same game and multi-game parlays) and other ways to get bonus bets. You can use these bonus bets to wager on NFL prop bets and NFL parlays.\n\nBetMGM claims a place among the top NBA betting sites in part due to offering deals such as a \u201cBet $10, Win $200 in bonus bet deals\u201d.\n\nThe qualifiers for this offer can vary, but one example of this is that if you wager $10 or more on an NBA contest and any player in that game makes a 3-point shot, you will get $200 in bet credits. This all but assures you will get the bet credits due to the fact that 3-point shots are incredibly common.\n\nOther NBA deals are also available, including the popular Select Your Squad offer.\n\nNo sport has more games available to bet on than MLB, which is why BetMGM sporadically offers a \u201cBet $10, Get $200\u201d in bonus bets deal to baseball bettors. This deal was based on a bet being placed rather than the outcome of the wager, so the $10 qualifying bet was guaranteed to generate the $200 in bonus bets.\n\nBetMGM sportsbook also gets creative with its ongoing promotions for this sport and will highlight these on the MLB betting page.\n\nThe NHL had its best TV ratings in nearly a decade last year, and BetMGM rewarded those viewers who wagered on hockey with a \u201cBet $10, Get $200 in bonus bets\u201d if a goal is scored in that game. It\u2019s the type of deal that is typically only available for a short time, so keep an eye out for it at the start of the season or during the Stanley Cup Playoffs.\n\nHockey bettors can also benefit from odds and profit boosts as well as parlay insurance deals that are often made available during the season.\n\nNo time of year gets more attention from sports bettors than the pro football playoffs, which is why BetMGM goes all out with offers designed to win over new customers and is considered one of the top Super Bowl betting sites.\n\nIn recent years, BetMGM Sportsbook offered a \u201cBet $10, Get $200\u201d in bonus bets deal that granted those first-time customers $200 in bet credits if at least one touchdown was scored in the game that was wagered on. This is a very high percentage deal since a playoff game with no touchdowns is very rare, and in this case the deal paid out the $200 in bonus bets. Also keep an eye out for its Super Bowl betting promos.\n\nMarch is when college basketball betting sites are deluged with potential new customers, which has led to BetMGM offering a \u201cBet $10, Win $200\u201d BetMGM bonus code during the NCAA tournament in previous years.\n\nBetMGM also provides a full slate of March Madness odds, including live in-game betting options, and has a varied selection of NCAA welcome bonuses available at that time of year.\n\nThe current BetMGM bonus code and introductory offer is comparable to the Caesars sportsbook promo code previous flagship offer that generated a $1,000 bonus bet refund for a first-bet loss, but the BetMGM deal has a higher ceiling at $1,500. BetMGM also intermittently provides a \u201cBet $5, Get $150\u201d in bonus bets offer or a \u201cBet & Win\u201d offer that rivals the sign-up deals available via the bet365 bonus code and at DraftKings and FanDuel.\n\nThe BetMGM bonus code is designed to go toe-to-toe with other online sportsbooks, as well as compete with newcomers to the market such as the ESPN BET promo, DraftKings promo code and the FanDuel promo code. This combination of elements keeps BetMGM in competition for a spot at or near the top of the best online sportsbooks.\n\nYou can use the BetMGM promo code USATODAY in Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, Washington, D.C., West Virginia and Wyoming. It is expected there will be a BetMGM Missouri bonus code offer once Missouri sportsbook apps go live later this year.\n\nEditor's note: This offer is not available in Nevada, New York or Puerto Rico.\n\nBetMGM lands a spot in the upper tier of sportsbooks due in part to offering one of the best betting interfaces on the market today.\n\nYou can quickly find the bets you are looking for or create customized parlay wagers with ease on the betting app and website. BetMGM is well known for having very competitive odds, meaning that you can feel comfortable making this your go-to betting site.\n\nBetMGM is also one of the best sites when it comes to live in-game betting, as it updates the odds very quickly and has a streamlined betting process that gets your wager placed fast.\n\nAnother benefit of wagering at BetMGM is that it shows pregame bettors the percentage of bettors who are landing on either side of the three standard odds types. Combine that with its stellar reputation for reliability, decades of quality customer service and a wide variety of ongoing promotions, and it\u2019s easy to see why so many sports bettors rely on BetMGM as one of their prime picks.\n\nBetMGM sportsbook offers a streamlined betting experience across both its desktop site and mobile app. The website presents betting markets, promotions and account tools in an intuitive layout, while the app delivers the same features with fast load times and easy navigation.\n\nAvailable on iOS and Android, the BetMGM app is free to download and ideal for betting on the go, giving players seamless access to odds, wagers, one-game parlays and live betting.
