  "description": "The review seeks to \"remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions,\" according to a letter.",
  "content": "The Trump administration is launching a \"comprehensive\" review of the Smithsonian Institution, taking a microscope to the nation's premier museum system amid a culture war campaign that has targeted leading American institutions.\n\nAdministration officials sent a letter on Aug. 12 to Smithsonian Secretary Lonnie Bunch III announcing there would be a review to determine if the Institution's materials conformed to the Trump administration's views on teaching history.\n\n\"This initiative aims to ensure alignment with the President's directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions,\" the letter states.\n\nThe letter sets a timeline for the Smithsonian to turn over materials for review and make changes. It states that within 120 days, the Smithsonian is expected to begin making \"content corrections where necessary, replacing divisive or ideologically driven language with unifying, historically accurate, and constructive descriptions.\"\n\nIn a statement, the Smithsonian said it would \"continue to collaborate constructively with the White House.\"\n\n\"The Smithsonian\u2019s work is grounded in a deep commitment to scholarly excellence, rigorous research, and the accurate, factual presentation of history. We are reviewing the letter with this commitment in mind,\" the statement reads.\n\nThe review will focus on Smithsonian exhibits, along with the process for creating them. It is expected to be completed early next year, which is the 250th anniversary of the nation's founding.\n\nThe letter cites the anniversary, saying, \"As we prepare to celebrate... it is more important thanever that our national museums reflect the unity, progress, and enduring values that define theAmerican story.\"\n\nFounded in 1846, the Smithsonian is a public-private partnership established by Congress. It has 21 museums, 14 education and research centers and includes the National Zoo. Federal funds make up about 62% of its budget, according to the Institution's website. It is governed by a 17-member Board of Regents that includes Vice President J.D. Vance, Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts, six members of Congress and nine members of the public.\n\nThe Trump administration's review will initially focus on eight museums, including the Museums of American History, African American History and Culture and Natural History, and the Museum of the American Indian.\n\nTrump's second administration has been marked by an aggressive culture war campaign that has taken aim at institutions such as Harvard University, which is locked in a legal battle with the administration, and the Kennedy Center, where the president named himself chair. Trump has also targeted diversity efforts and transgender athletes.\n\nThe president laid the groundwork for the Smithsonian review with an executive order in March entitled \"restoring truth and sanity to American history.\" The order includes a section called \"Saving Our Smithsonian\" that directs Vance to work with other administration officials on \"seeking to remove improper ideology from such properties.\"\n\nThe executive order was met with criticism by some historians who questioned whether it would allow for a balanced and accurate telling of history.\n\nThe Smithsonian recently removed references to Trump from an exhibit on presidential impeachment but later restored them.",

      "text": "Smithsonian ignores Hiroshima, Nagasaki bombings on 80th anniversary\nIn the absence of special events, the Enola Gay, the plane that bombed Hiroshima, will quietly remain on display at the National Air & Space Museum's airport annex.\n- The 19-museum Smithsonian Institution is under pressure from the Trump Administration over what the president has called \"woke' content.\n- A proposed 1995 Air and Space Museum exhibit on the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings was scuttled over objections that it overemphasized the suffering of Japanese victims.\nEighty years ago, the world entered the nuclear age when Enola Gay, a modified U.S. Army Air Corps B-29 Superfortress, dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Three days later, on Aug. 9, 1945, a second atomic strike hit Nagasaki.\nThe Smithsonian\u2019s National Air and Space Museum, despite holding the Enola Gay in its collections, is not hosting any events or special exhibits to mark the anniversary on Aug. 6, a spokesperson confirmed to USA TODAY. The museum will instead share information and existing web content about the bombings on social media.\nThe otherwise unmarked anniversary comes as the nation\u2019s museums stand at a crossroads after President Donald Trump\u2019s March executive order aiming to restore what he called \u201ctruth and sanity\u201d to museums and history education.\nTrump\u2019s executive order is but the most recent offensive in long-running wars over America\u2019s past, including the mid-1990s when a planned exhibit of Enola Gay for the bombings\u2019 50th anniversary sparked a major clash between the Smithsonian, politicians, and veterans\u2019 organizations.\nTrump White House officials blasted Lonnie Bunch III, secretary of the Smithsonian and founding director of the institution\u2019s National Museum of African American History and Culture, as \u201ca Democrat donor and rabid partisan\u201d in April comments to the New York Times. (The White House did not comment for this story.)\nIn June, the Smithsonian, in response to Trump\u2019s order, initiated a content review for its 19 museums. The National Museum of American History recently removed references to Trump\u2019s impeachments from an exhibit on the presidency but said it will soon restore them.\nA 'duty' to history\nTwo nuclear disarmament advocates with personal connections to the atomic bombings told USA TODAY that they would\u2019ve liked to see the Smithsonian tackle the anniversary \u2212 likely one of the final major anniversaries where a significant number of Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors remain alive \u2212 in a more prominent and even-handed manner.\nAri Beser, a multimedia storyteller and author, is the grandson of 1st Lt. Jacob Beser, an Army Air Corps radar specialist who was the only person to fly on both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombing missions.\n\u201cI think that the Smithsonian has a duty to memorialize history from every angle,\u201d said Beser, a member of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to understand the historical context in which these decisions are made, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t learn from the negative consequences of what they did.\u201d\nNorth Carolina author Kathleen Burkinshaw, whose Japanese mother survived the Hiroshima strike before immigrating to America with her Air Force father, lives today with chronic pain from reflex sympathetic dystrophy that she believes is related to her mother\u2019s radiation exposure.\nShe expressed concern about potentially oversimplified narratives that focus on the war-winning nature of the bombs without acknowledging the human suffering they caused.\n\u201cThey just hear that (the bomb) wins wars,\u201d Burkinshaw said of the students to whom she speaks about her mother\u2019s experience. \u201cWell, at what cost?\u201d\nThe Enola Gay controversy\nBut when the Smithsonian planned a special Air and Space Museum exhibition featuring the Enola Gay ahead of the bombing's 50th anniversary in 1995, attempts to broach the impact and legacy of the weapons set off a political firestorm.\nThe proposed exhibit, initially entitled \u201cCrossroads\u201d and later dubbed \u201cThe Last Act,\u201d was to include photos and artifacts from both Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as information about survivors\u2019 experiences. One proposed centerpiece: a dead 12-year-old Hiroshima girl\u2019s lunchbox, deformed by the heat of the blast, with charred rice and peas still inside.\nThe draft exhibit would have asked visitors to consider historical debates over whether the bomb was necessary to end the war before a planned (and surely bloody) American invasion of Japan\u2019s home islands. Museum patrons also would have wrestled with the dawn of the nuclear age that began in August 1945.\nAir and Space Museum director Martin Harwit, a Czech-American astrophysicist, told USA TODAY that his 1950s stint in the U.S. Army as a technician monitoring massive thermonuclear weapons tests in the Pacific made a \u201csignificant difference\u201d to his approach at the Smithsonian.\nHowever, veterans groups \u2013 most notably the Air Force Association and American Legion \u2013 believed the exhibit script painted Imperial Japan as victims rather than as the initial aggressor in the Pacific War. Despite a committee review in early 1994, the revised script failed to satisfy both the veterans and members of Congress, who believed it still didn\u2019t focus enough on Japanese forces\u2019 brutality.\nUltimately, the Smithsonian pulled the plug on the exhibit. Instead, the Enola Gay was displayed with very little contextual material; now the plane sits at the museum\u2019s off-site Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia.\nThat did not satisfy the critics. More than 80 members of Congress, predominantly Republicans, publicly demanded Harwit\u2019s resignation, which he submitted just before Senate hearings weeks before the plane went on display.\nTom Crouch, a key Smithsonian figure involved in producing the scuttled 1995 exhibit, declined comment when reached by USA TODAY.\n\u201cI am sure you understand the sensitivity of the topic, particularly now,\u201d Crouch wrote via email. \u201cI would not feel comfortable commenting on the subject given the current pressures on the Secretary (of the Smithsonian). Sorry.\u201d\n'Greater calamities'\nHarwit, now 94, argued that Americans need more than just feel-good history about the war. He fears \u201cpeople have forgotten all about\u201d the threat of nuclear war.\n\u201cAs we celebrate the end of World War II, nobody will wish to be reminded that the very nuclear weapons which ended (the war) could someday lead to even greater calamities,\u201d he said.\nDavis Winkie's role covering nuclear threats and national security at USA TODAY is supported by a partnership with Outrider Foundation and Journalism Funding Partners. Funders do not provide editorial input."

      "text": "Trump names a new head of the Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in DC: himself\nWASHINGTON \u2212 Former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, renowned for her grace and elegance, once served as an honorary chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, which was named for her slain husband.\nPresident Dwight Eisenhower first envisioned the cultural center, which sits on the east bank of the Potomac River, as an \u201cartistic mecca\u201d in 1959 .\nMore than six decades later, just shy of three weeks of being sworn-in as president for the second time, Donald Trump announced on social media that he had found an \u201camazing\u201d chairman to take the Kennedy Center reins: Himself.\nTrump also said he had decided to \u201cimmediately terminate multiple individuals\u201d from the Kennedy Center's board of trustees, including the chairman, who he said did not share \u201cour Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\u201d\nWhat drew Trump\u2019s ire?\n\u201cJust last year, the Kennedy Center featured Drag Shows specifically targeting our youth \u2014 THIS WILL STOP,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe Kennedy Center is an American Jewel, and must reflect the brightest STARS on its stage from all across our Nation.\u201d\nAlthough Trump has not released public statements against drag, he has sought to bar transgender student athletes from playing women\u2019s sports and cut off federal money for schools that don\u2019t comply. A Wednesday executive order also could block transgender athletes from entering the country for the 2028 Olympics.\nBillionaire philanthropist David Rubenstein, who served as board chairman since 2010, was appointed to the Kennedy Center board by former President George W. Bush.\nAlthough Trump claimed he had \u201cimmediately terminated\u201d Rubenstein, an old news release on the center\u2019s website said he was retiring in January 2025.\nThe release also said that Rubenstein would lead the Kennedy Center Foundation, a new organization established by the board of trustees \u201cfocusing on advancing national philanthropic support for the Kennedy Center.\u201d\nKennedy Center did not respond to email and phone calls asking for comment.\nThe center is described on the website as a \u201cliving memorial to President John F. Kennedy.\u201d It attracts millions of visitors each year to more than 2,000 performances and is home to the National Symphony Orchestra and Washington National Opera."

      "text": "Smithsonian puts Trump's name back in museum's impeachment display - with changes\nThe Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History has restored references to President Donald Trump after removing them from a presidential impeachment display in late July.\nFirst reported by The Washington Post on July 31, changes to \"The American Presidency: A Glorious Burden\" entailed the total removal of what the museum called a temporary placard briefly covering Trump's two impeachments in 2019 and 2021.\nA more permanent display about the president has since been added, as have artifacts from the proceedings. Some text was changed between displays, specifically concerning Trump's involvement with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and accusations of election interference.\nSmithsonian was 'not asked by any Administration' to change exhibit\nThe previous, temporary Trump plaque, which was added in 2021, was taken out in July to return the display to how it appeared nearly 20 years ago in 2008, according to a Smithsonian statement shared with USA TODAY on Aug. 1. The Washington Post also noted that the exhibit said that \"only three presidents have seriously faced removal,\" meaning Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon.\nThe change was made because it \"did not meet the museum\u2019s standards in appearance,\" the Smithsonian Institute said in an Aug. 2 statement, adding that it blocked the view of other objects inside the case.\n\"We were not asked by any Administration or other government official to remove content from the exhibit,\" it said, telling USA TODAY in a separate statement that, \"A future and updated exhibit will include all impeachments,\" noting that updating and renewing permanent galleries \"requires a significant amount of time and funding.\"\nThe museum unveiled an updated exhibit on Aug. 8.\n\"At the heart of the Smithsonian\u2019s work is a steadfast commitment to scholarship, rigorous research, and the accurate, factual presentation of history,\" the institute said in a statement shared with USA TODAY on Aug. 11. \"The National Museum of American History has completed its update to the Impeachment case within 'The American Presidency: A Glorious Burden' exhibition. The updated display now reflects all presidential impeachments.\"\nTrump added back to impeachment display\nIn September 2021, a \"temporary label on content concerning the impeachments of Donald J. Trump\" was added, according to the Smithsonian.\nFrom September 2021 to July 2025, a large placard was suspended at the forefront of the display with the title, \"Case under redesign ('history happens').\" It mentioned the impeachment proceedings brought against Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon, who resigned before he could be formally impeached, as well as Trump.\nBehind it were more permanent sections about Johnson's impeachment, including tickets and newspaper clips from the time; Nixon's Senate hearing and resignation, including testimony papers, a filing cabinet and photos from the proceedings; and Clinton's trial, with tickets and Senate question cards.\nFrom late July to the exhibit reopening on Aug. 8, the removal of the placard meant there were no references to Trump, who is the first and only president in American history to be impeached twice.\nNow, Trump occupies a smaller placard at the bottom of the display case, which also includes 2019 and 2021 tickets to the impeachment proceedings acquired in June 2025, the Smithsonian said in a statement shared with USA TODAY.\nChanges to text describing Trump impeachments\nChanges were also made to the text describing the Trump proceedings, as reported by the Post and The New York Times and confirmed via photos by USA TODAY.\nThe word \"alleged\" was added to the text about Trump's 2020 impeachment trial, changing the sentence, \"The charges focused on the president\u2019s solicitation of foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election....\" to, \"The charges focused on the president\u2019s alleged solicitation of foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election and defiance of Congressional subpoenas. Trump was acquitted in January 2020.\"\nMore significant changes were made to the description of the second 2021 impeachment. Specifically, the phrases \"repeated 'false statements'\" and \"'encouraged \u2012 and foreseeably resulted in \u2012 imminent lawless action at the Capitol'\" were removed when discussing Trump's involvement in Jan. 6.\nPreviously, the placard read: \"On January 13, 2021, Donald Trump became the first president to be impeached twice. The charge was incitement of insurrection, based on repeated 'false statements' challenging the 2020 election results and his January 6 speech that 'encouraged \u2012 and foreseeably resulted in \u2012 imminent lawless action at the Capitol.' Because Trump\u2019s term ended on January 20, his acquittal on February 13 made him the first former president tried by the Senate.\"\nNow, it reads: \"On January 13, 2021, Donald Trump became the first president to be impeached twice. The charge was incitement of insurrection based on his challenge of the 2020 election results and on his speech on January 6. Because Trump\u2019s term ended on January 20, he became the first former president tried by the Senate. He was acquitted on February 13, 2021.\u201d\nThe Smithsonian declined to clarify the reason behind these changes.\n\"Adhering to principles foundational to our role as the nation's museum, we take great care to ensure that what we present to the public reflects both intellectual integrity and thoughtful design,\" it said in its Aug. 11 statement.\nThe controversy surrounding the Smithsonian's change to the display came after the White House in May pushed for the removal of art director Kim Sajet from her role as director of the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery, citing her \"strong support\" of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).\nIn March, Trump also signed an executive order demanding the removal of \"anti-American ideology\" from the Smithsonian and other cultural institutions and tasked a White House official, Lindsey Halligan, with scrutinizing \"improper ideology\" at said institutions."

      "text": "Trump signs executive order targeting transgender girls, women athletes\nPresident Donald Trump sought to bar transgender student athletes from playing women\u2019s sports and cut off federal money for schools that don\u2019t comply. His executive order Wednesday also could block transgender athletes from entering the country for the 2028 Olympics.\nSchools receiving taxpayer money are \"on notice\" that they could lose federal funding if they don't comply with the order, Trump said before signing the document amid a crowd of supporters at the White House.\n\u201cFrom now on, women\u2019s sports will be only for women,\u201d he said.\nThe order directs the Department of Education, which Trump wants to eliminate, to pursue \"enforcement actions\" under Title IX, the federal law prohibiting discrimination based on sex in educational institutions. Some legal experts question whether the Trump administration's interpretation of the law would hold sway in court, though.\n\"Trump is giving his opinion about his interpretation of Title IX,\" said Scott Schneider, a Texas attorney who handles Title IX cases. \"Ultimately, it's an issue that is in litigation and in which courts have taken certainly contrary views to what's in that executive order.\"\nThe Biden administration expanded protections for transgender students with new Title IX rules, but they recently were overturned by a federal judge. Now Trump wants to use the law to go after schools with trans-inclusive policies.\nEvery executive branch agency is tasked with reviewing educational grants under the order and withholding funding from programs that don't comply.\nThe order calls for the departments of Homeland Security and State to police transgender athletes. The agencies will seek to prohibit transgender women from entering the country to participate in athletic competitions. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem will \"deny any and all visa applications\" from transgender female athletes, Trump said Wednesday, which could affect the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.\nTrump said Secretary of State Marco Rubio also will be pressing Olympic organizers on transgender policies. The International Olympic Committee allows each sport's governing body to set rules on transgender participation.\nTrump campaigned on opposing transgender athletes in women's sports and pitched the executive order as delivering on that promise. He gathered lawmakers in the East Room of the White House to celebrate Wednesday and was surrounded by children in athletic jerseys as he signed the order. The order is among several early measures Trump's administration has taken targeting transgender people.\nLegal and civil rights experts have said it's not clear Trump has the authority to implement such broad restrictions immediately and unilaterally at the federal level. To prevent transgender students from playing school sports legally, Congress would likely have to amend the 1972 sex discrimination law known as Title IX, or the Education Department would have to process new regulations.\nThe question of whether transgender student-athletes have a right to play on their chosen team has remained unresolved by the courts, Schneider said. For that reason, he said, the president's announcement won't have wide-ranging implications.\n\"There is no real practical significance to it,\" he said. \"Absent a court decision in your jurisdiction, or a change in Title IX, the status quo is maintained.\"\nThough many states already have restrictions in place to curb or block trans athletes' participation in school sports, others provide explicit protections for them.\n\u201cMake no mistake, multiple states have attempted to enact similar bans. We\u2019ve confronted them in court repeatedly and have won repeatedly,\" Carl Charles, a Lambda Legal senior attorney, said in a statement. \"There is no reason to think a national ban will avoid being similarly squashed.\"\nThe president and other Republicans in recent years have exaggerated the extent to which trans youth, who make up only 1.4% of American teenagers, according to federal survey data, participate in sports. A 2017 study of 17,000 young people found that about 1 in 10 trans boys said they played sports, and the statistic is roughly the same for trans girls.\nThe GOP-controlled U.S. House of Representatives recently passed a bill seeking to accomplish the same objective as Trump's order. Curbing civil rights for transgender people came up often in Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, and after his victory, it became a point of contention for some Democrats as well.\nThe order this week comes after former President Joe Biden tried to bolster protections for queer and transgender students, who face disproportionate harassment and barriers to education, research shows. His administration's efforts, which involved rewriting Title IX, met conservative opposition at every turn.\nJust before Trump took office, a federal judge vacated the Biden administration\u2019s revisions to the regulations, which temporarily expanded the definition of sexual misconduct in schools in some states to include gender identity."

      "text": "Harvard, Trump administration face off in court over canceled funding\nThe court hearing in Boston marked a crucial moment in the White House's escalating conflict with Harvard.\nBOSTON \u2013 Harvard University urged a federal judge to order the Trump administration to restore about $2.5 billion in canceled federal grants and cease efforts to cut off research funding to the prestigious Ivy League school.\nBut a lawyer for the Trump administration told the judge the canceled grants reflect a government priority not to send money to institutions that practice antisemitism.\n\"Harvard prioritized campus protesters over cancer research,\" said Michael Velchik, a senior lawyer at the U.S. Justice Department. He told the judge she shouldn't be hearing the case in the first place, arguing the matter belonged in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, which handles monetary disputes.\nThe court hearing before U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs on July 21 lasted more than two hours, but ended without a ruling. The case marks a crucial moment in the White House's escalating conflict with Harvard, which has been in the administration's crosshairs after it rejected a list of demands to make changes to its governance, hiring and admissions practices in April.\nThe university, in nearby Cambridge, Massachusetts, says that hundreds of research projects, including some related to cancer treatment, infectious diseases and Parkinson's would be in jeopardy unless the judge declares the grant cancellations unlawful.\nThe country's oldest and richest university has become a central focus of the administration's broad campaign to leverage federal funding to force change at universities, which Trump says are gripped by antisemitic and \"radical left\" ideologies.\nSteven Lehotsky, a lawyer for Harvard, said the government has made wholesale cuts to research under the guise of combating antisemitism, but hasn't identified any connection between the two.\n\"The administration has given no consideration to patients, the public at large and the harm of all this research being cut off,\" Lehotsky told the court.\n\"The Trump administration's proposition is simple and commonsense: Don\u2019t allow antisemitism and DEI to run your campus, don't break the law, and protect the civil liberties of all students,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement.\nAmong the earliest actions the administration took against Harvard was canceling hundreds of grants awarded to researchers under the premise that the school had not done enough to address harassment of Jewish students on its campus.\nThe Trump administration has since sought to bar international students from attending the school, threatened Harvard's accreditation status and opened the door to cutting off more funds by finding it violated federal civil rights law.\nDemonstrators 'dismayed, shocked, disgusted' by Trump admin actions\nThinking about how different her life might have been if her parents hadn\u2019t come to the United States decades ago has a \u201cvisceral impact\u201d on Salini Pillai.\nThe rising Harvard junior was among the dozens of people gathered outside the Boston courthouse after proceedings ended for the day. She was born in the United States, but her parents immigrated to the country in pursuit of higher education.\n\u201cThey came here for all of the ideals that this country promises, and the fact that ... people get to pick and choose who gets those freedoms and who doesn\u2019t is something that I fundamentally disagree with and I find very scary,\u201d she said.\nThe administration\u2019s actions have had a noticeable impact on the campus, she said, adding that she believes her international friends are being \u201cused as sort of a pawn\u201d and that the university's research has suffered without the support of federal funding.\nThough some may question why Harvard, which has an endowment of more than $50 billion, needs financial support, Pillai said research often relies on government funding because of the \u201camount of capital that\u2019s required to do certain amounts of groundwork and research.\u201d\nShe added that the university acts as a type of litmus test for higher education more broadly.\n\u201cEven if Harvard isn\u2019t the one that\u2019s most impacted by this precedent, the downstream effects of ... Harvard being subjected to these sort of funding cuts is ... immense,\u201d she said.\nSeveral people at the rally were affiliated with Crimson Courage, an organization Harvard alumni formed in April to support the university amid the threats it faced.\nAmong them was Helen Fairman, a 1991 graduate who said the organization's members have benefited from pursuing higher education in their respective lives and want to see others have the same opportunities.\n\u201cWe know how important it is, and we\u2019re all just banding together to try to ... salvage what we can at Harvard and push back,\u201d she said.\nEvelyn Kim, a class of 1995 alumna who\u2019s also involved in Crimson Courage, said higher education is in an \u201cexistential battle\u201d against the Trump administration that\u2019s left her \u201cdismayed, shocked (and) disgusted.\u201d\nLike Pillai, Kim said her activism is about far more than backing her alma mater.\n\u201cThis is not just a Harvard story,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThis is a national story, it\u2019s a local story, it\u2019s an international story.\u201d\nJudge: halting grants for any reason is \"major stumbling block\"\nBurroughs said she had problems with the government's argument that it can terminate Harvard's federal funding grants for any policy reasons.\n\"That's a major stumbling block for me,\" the judge said.\nBurroughs also questioned the government's stance that there doesn't have to be an adversarial process to assess whether Harvard has taken steps to root out antisemitism on campus.\n\"If you can make this decision, that we're going to withdraw all this funding for reasons oriented around speech, the consequences to that, in terms of constitutional law, are staggering to me,\" Burroughs said.\nMeanwhile, as part of Trump's spending and tax bill, the Republican-led Congress increased the federal excise tax on Harvard\u2019s income from its $53 billion endowment to 8% from 1.4%. Income from the endowment covers 40% of Harvard's operating budget.\nHarvard President Alan Garber said last week that the various federal actions since Trump returned to office in January could strip the school of nearly $1 billion annually, forcing it to lay off staff and freeze hiring.\nHarvard has said it has taken steps to ensure its campus is welcoming to Jewish and Israeli students, who it acknowledges experienced \"vicious and reprehensible\" treatment following the onset of Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza in October 2023.\nBut, Garber has said the administration's demands have gone far beyond addressing antisemitism and unlawfully seek to regulate the \"intellectual conditions\" on its campus by controlling who it hires and who it teaches.\nThose demands, outlined in an April 11 letter from an administration task force, included calls for the private university to restructure its governance, alter its hiring and admissions practices to ensure an ideological balance of viewpoints and end certain academic programs.\nAfter Harvard rejected those demands, university officials say the administration began retaliating against the campus in violation of free speech protections under the First Amendment by abruptly cutting funding that officials say is vital to supporting scientific and medical research.\nBurroughs, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, has already barred the administration in a separate case from halting its ability to host international students. She is expected to issue a written ruling in the funding case in the coming weeks.\nTrump has expressed optimism that Harvard will eventually settle with his administration. Fields on Friday said a good deal was more than possible and that the administration is \"confident that Harvard will eventually come around and support the president\u2019s vision.\"\nIn court, the administration has argued that Burroughs lacks jurisdiction to hear the challenge and that the grant contracts made clear they could be canceled if the funded projects do not carry out federal government policy objectives.\nReuters contributed.\n(This story was updated to add new information.)"

      "text": "Philanthropy at the Smithsonian\nWe thank all those who make today's Smithsonian possible.\nAs a unique public-private partnership, the Smithsonian leverages an extraordinary commitment from Congress to activate private support, connecting with more Americans where they are, with more impact. We could not do this without your support. Thank you. We invite readers to flip through the Smithsonian Annual Report below from FY2023 (October 2022\u2013September 2023).\nJames Smithson, the founding donor of the Smithsonian, was an Englishman and a scientist. He never stepped foot in the United States but admired its founding ideals of equality and freedom. When he died, he bequeathed his estate to the young nation to establish the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., \u201cfor the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\u201d\nThe institution was established in 1846\u2014nearly a decade after Smithson\u2019s gift\u2014and relied solely on Smithson\u2019s endowment. As the Smithsonian grew, Congress recognized it as an essential service to the nation and provided public funds as well.\nSmithson\u2019s gift inspired a unique public-private partnership that leverages an extraordinary commitment from Congress to activate additional private support to connect with more Americans. It also laid the foundation for a rich history of giving to expand and enhance the Smithsonian\u2019s priorities.\nToday, federal funds make up about 62% of the institution\u2019s annual budget. Congressional funding helps sustain our unparalleled collections, provide for infrastructure and administrative services, and ensure our place on the National Mall and in the nation\u2019s imagination.\nPrivate funds amplify the impact of Congressional support. A staff of about 300 advancement professionals across the institution work with leadership to raise $300 million annually from individuals, corporations, foundations and others. Donors\u2019 contributions support our dynamic exhibitions, vast educational resources, multi-disciplinary research in more than 140 countries, and more.\nPhilanthropy is especially crucial as we plan and build the National Museum of the American Latino and the Smithsonian American Women\u2019s History Museum. These landmark institutions will illuminate the diverse stories that shape our national identity and shared achievements.\nIn a rapidly changing world, private philanthropy bolsters the Smithsonian\u2019s role as a trusted global center of learning. Donors\u2019 support allows us to explore the world through the lenses of art, science, history and culture; cultivate a passion for learning; inspire curiosity and wonder; and work together toward a single, bold vision: to build a better future for all.\nThere are many ways to give to the Smithsonian. Direct giving, online giving, membership, gift planning, and foundation and corporate sponsorships provide unrestricted funds which go toward the greatest need across the Smithsonian.\nYou can also give directly to specific museums, research centers, projects and/or initiatives at the Smithsonian.\nAs a nation, we are still striving to live up to the founding principles James Smithson so admired. The Smithsonian matters more than ever as a force for civic engagement in America that reaches people where they are. Join generations of donors who have made the Smithsonian what it is today\u2014an institution that educates, sustains and serves the nation as only the Smithsonian can.\nFunds Raised by Source\nFiscal Year 2023\nFunds Raised by Purpose\nDistinguished Benefactors Room\nThe Smithsonian honors its most generous donors by prominently recognizing them in the Distinguished Benefactors Room in the Smithsonian Castle. Distinguished Benefactors are individual donors whose gifts total $1 million or more, and foundations and corporations that have made one-time gifts of the same amount. In addition to being recognized in the Castle, Distinguished Benefactors are listed in the Smithsonian\u2019s Annual Report.\nWhile the Castle is closed for renovation, we invite you to learn more about the Distinguished Benefactors Room."

      "text": "DEI explained: What is DEI and why is it so divisive? What you need to know.\nDonald Trump kicked off the campaign to abolish diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives during his first term. Now he's back in the Oval Office to finish the job.\nDuring an address Tuesday night before a joint session of Congress, the president claimed his administration had eliminated DEI.\n\"We have ended the tyranny of so-called diversity, equity and inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and, indeed, the private sector and our military,\" Trump said. \"And our country will be woke no longer.\"\nJust hours after he took the oath of office on Jan. 20, Trump began issuing executive orders to dismantle programs, put pressure on federal contractors to end \u201cillegal DEI discrimination\u201d and direct federal agencies to draw up lists of private companies that could be investigated for their DEI policies.\nCabinet officials quickly followed. In one of his first directives to Pentagon employees, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sent a short note with \"DoD \u2260 DEI\" in large black letters. \"Those who do not comply will no longer work here,\" he wrote.\nSome companies like Facebook and Instagram owner Meta canceled DEI programs altogether to align themselves with the Trump administration.\n\"President Trump's speech confirmed what we already knew: He is intent on attacking all pathways to the American Dream that give all people the freedom to thrive in our nation and instead hoard opportunity for the privileged few,\" Andrea Abrams, executive director of the progressive advocacy group Defending American Values Coalition, told USA TODAY in a statement. \"His baseless attacks on DEI are attacks on the promise of America, the promise that everyone should be able to build the life of their dreams without barriers standing in their way.\"\nWith Trump fueling the backlash, tensions are running high in a nation already polarized over DEI. But what is DEI?\nWhat is the meaning of DEI?\nDEI stands for diversity, equity and inclusion. Beyond that, there is little agreement on what it means.\nOn the one hand, DEI is a broad-brush term that refers to the policies and measures that organizations use to prevent discrimination, comply with civil rights laws and create environments more welcoming to people from marginalized backgrounds.\nSupporters of these diversity programs say they help companies hire and retain top talent and boost innovation and profits.\n\"Talk to any CEO of a major Fortune 500 company. They\u2019ll tell you that their bottom line, dollar wise, does better when there\u2019s more diversity in the room,\" Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, a former civil rights lawyer and a Democrat, recently told the New York Times.\nCritics see diversity initiatives differently. They say DEI focuses on race and gender at the expense of individual merit and they have challenged these initiatives in courtrooms and on social media as illegal discrimination \u2013 so called \u201creverse discrimination\u201d \u2013 against white people.\nSome of the \u201cwoke\u201d excesses critics object to? Linking executive compensation to diversity goals and sponsoring fellowship or internship programs open only to certain groups.\nDEI \u201cpostulates that American society is systemically racist, oppressive, animated by white supremacy or any of many other ills attributed to America, its founding, and its culture,\u201d Mike Gonzalez, a senior fellow at The Heritage Foundation, recently wrote. \u201cDEI does not promote diversity, etc., to which few people would object. It seeks to dismantle our entire society and recast it.\u201d\nWhy is there a DEI backlash?\nA wave of DEI initiatives swept through the federal government and corporate America after George Floyd's 2020 murder forced a historic reckoning with race in America. That wave was quickly met with a forceful backlash from conservative foundations, think tanks and political operatives that joined forces to make DEI a mainstream flashpoint.\nIn 2023, the Supreme Court struck down race-conscious college admissions. The ruling didn\u2019t have direct implications for companies but it energized conservative groups led by Stephen Miller, now White House deputy chief of staff for policy, and anti-affirmative action activist Edward Blum, who have targeted corporate \u201cwokeism\u201d at nearly four dozen companies from Apple to Pizza Hut-owner Yum! Brands.\nThey took aim at controversial measures such as setting hiring targets, which they say are illegal racial quotas, for women and people of color.\nThe organization that Miller co-founded, America First Legal, recently called on the Labor Department to investigate federal contractors, like Meta and Lyft, with DEI policies that it says may violate federal law and Trump's executive order. On Tuesday, the Trump administration sided with Blum's American Alliance for Equal Rights in challenging a recently enacted Illinois law that requires nonprofits to publicly disclose demographic information such as the race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation and gender identity of its officers and directors.\nAnother activist, Robby Starbuck, wrung concessions from corporations like Walmart and Target through pressure campaigns on social media.\n\u201cThe tenets of DEI demand that you discriminate against white people by giving preferential treatment to other races,\u201d harming white men and Asians, Starbuck said on a recent podcast.\nWhat is \u2018illegal\u2019 DEI?\nWhat does the Trump administration mean by \u201cillegal\u201d DEI?\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Justice Department recently issued policy guidance on what constitutes \"unlawful DEI-related discrimination\u201d and which programs it will target.\n\u201cFar too many employers defend certain types of race or sex preferences as good, provided they are motivated by business interests in \u2018diversity, equity, or inclusion.\u2019 But no matter an employer\u2019s motive, there is no \u2018good,\u2019 or even acceptable, race or sex discrimination,\u201d EEOC Acting Chair Andrea Lucas said in a statement.\nDavid Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at the NYU School of Law, said the guidance offers a window into how the Trump administration will interpret and enforce a landmark 1964 civil rights law that bars employment discrimination.\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was enacted to help qualified women and people of color land jobs. The Trump administration has alleged that ensuing corporate DEI practices have unfairly disadvantaged and discriminated against white men.\n\u201cThe documents unsurprisingly take a broad view of what forms of DEI are unlawful,\u201d Glasgow said in a LinkedIn post. \u201cHowever, I think it's notable that even this vehemently anti-DEI administration appears to acknowledge that many forms of DEI remain lawful.\u201d\nAccording to Joelle Emerson, CEO of of culture and inclusion platform Paradigm Strategy, programs that may run afoul of the Trump administration include:\n- Exclusion from training opportunities;\n- Access to mentoring, sponsorship or workplace networking opportunities, raising the risk that employee resource groups not open to everyone could be targeted;\n- Limiting access to internships, fellowships and other programs to specific underrepresented groups;\n- Including or excluding a job candidate from a hiring pool based on race, sex or other protected characteristics (such as corporate America's use of the NFL's \u201cRooney rule\u201d);\n- Training that separates workers into groups by protected characteristics.\nAccording to employment lawyer Jon Hyman, the law does not prohibit employers from:\n- Promoting a diverse workforce of qualified employees from different backgrounds;\n- Ensuring fair treatment, access and opportunity for everyone while working to remove barriers \u201cthat have historically led to unequal outcomes;\u201d\n- Creating an environment where people from all backgrounds feel welcome.\n\u201cWhat the law does prohibit \u2013 and has since 1964 \u2013 is hiring preferences, quotas, or any other form of discrimination based on a protected class. That includes unfair treatment in hiring, firing, compensation, promotions, or any other term or condition of employment,\u201d Hyman, a shareholder with Wickens Herzer Panza, said in a LinkedIn post.\nNot all DEI was created equal\nSome of the initiatives that sprang from the Me Too movement in 2017 and Floyd\u2019s murder were ineffective or performative, such as workplace training sessions on race, diversity advocates say.\n\u201cDEI has become a political football but that does not mean it\u2019s immune from criticism,\u201d Y-Vonne Hutchinson, CEO and founder of DEI firm ReadySet, said in a TED Talk last year. \u201cPeople in organizations made real mistakes.\u201d\nThe problem now, according to diversity advocates: The political right has conflated the term DEI with programs that most people support and that benefit everyone.\n\"The discrimination that people like me face hasn't gone away,\" said Hutchinson, who is Black.\nDEI vs. merit?\nIn an effort to avoid potential legal challenges, companies are removing mentions of diversity from their securities filings and increasingly they are adding a new term: \u201cMeritocracy.\u201d\nOil company ExxonMobil recently said it is focused \u201con building an engaged, global workforce; grounded in meritocracy.\u201d\nBob Sternfels, global managing partner for consulting firm McKinsey, recently told employees: \u201cWe don\u2019t guarantee equity in outcomes, but we do strive to ensure everyone has a fair shot to succeed in our meritocracy.\u201d\nMeritocracy gained currency last year when Alexandr Wang, founder of artificial intelligence start-up Scale AI, coined the term \u201cMEI\u201d or \u201cmerit, excellence and intelligence\u201d which he said meant hiring \u201conly the best person for the job.\u201d\nIn fulfilling campaign pledges to cancel in the public and private sectors, Trump has boosted the conservative talking point, calling for America to become a \u201ccolorblind and merit-based\u201d society.\nFew people would disagree that the workplace should be merit-driven. But in recent years, conservative activists have positioned DEI as the polar opposite of merit.\n\u201cDEI was never intended to be about merit,\u201d The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Gonzalez said.\nTrump \"has restored merit as the cornerstone of all federal policy,\" Miller said during a White House briefing.\nBusiness leaders have talked up the concept of merit for years. High-tech entrepreneur and investor Mitch Kapor has said corporations operate a \u201cmirrortocracy,\u201d not a meritocracy, a self-reinforcing system that concentrates power, influence and decision-making authority in the hands of one demographic group.\nGlasgow said he\u2019s \u201cdeeply frustrated\u201d that conservatives pit DEI against merit.\nAccording to Glasgow, DEI helps make sure systems are meritocratic by breaking down barriers and expanding the talent pool so companies can hire and promote the best people.\n\u201cWe know from decades of extensive research that, in the absence of DEI efforts, humans do not make perfectly merit-based decisions,\u201d Glasgow wrote on LinkedIn. \u201cFar from being opposed to merit, DEI supports merit-based decision-making.\u201d\nCreating a true meritocracy \"means creating and stewarding rigorous systems for hiring, feedback and promotion\" and eliminating discrimination, said fairness, access, inclusion and representation strategist Lily Zheng, author of \"Reconstructing DEI.\"\n\"DEI done right is how we achieve our aspirations of meritocracy,\" Zheng wrote on LinkedIn.\nDid DEI change corporate America?\nAfter Floyd\u2019s murder, America\u2019s largest corporations worked to reverse decades of disparities and remove bias from hiring and retention practices.\nThose efforts seemed to get results. Between 2020 and 2022, the number of Black executives rose by nearly 27% in S&P 100 companies, according to a USA TODAY analysis of workforce data collected by the federal government.\nBut the DEI backlash slowed that momentum. The ranks of Black executives fell 3% in 2023 from the prior year at twice the rate of white executives. Data for 2024 is not yet available.\nToday, white men still dominate the corridors of power. Even with recent gains, Black Americans are outnumbered 12 to 1 by white people in executive roles.\nCivil rights leaders warn DEI rollbacks could erase hard-fought gains in the workplace.\nWithout DEI, \"we risk reverting to environments where homogeneity is the norm, bias and discrimination go more unchecked and the status quo remains unchallenged, where our nation will increasingly default to the belief that competence and privilege lie first and foremost with white men,\" said Rev. Adam Russell Taylor, president of the Christian nonprofit Sojourners.\nThat belief \"contradicts our best civic and religious values and makes our workplaces less competitive,\" he said.\nIs DEI dying?\nWeaponized by critics, the term DEI has been phased out of corporate lingo and struck from public filings and less polarized terms like inclusion and belonging have taken its place. For example, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, BlackRock, recently folded DEI and talent management staff into one \u201cTalent and Culture\u201d group.\nBut what about the substance of the work?\nSome initiatives such as prioritizing diversity among suppliers are getting the ax as the political and legal climate shifts. Participating in external workforce surveys such as the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s Corporate Equality Index, which measures business support for LGBTQ employees, is also on the outs.\nDon\u2019t write off DEI just yet, says James White, a seasoned Black executive and former Jamba Juice CEO. His belief? Companies that have been doing the work will keep doing it for one simple reason: It\u2019s good for business.\nCostco successfully fought off an anti-DEI shareholder proposal from a conservative group, saying \u201cour commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary.\u201d\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has said he plans to eliminate some diversity initiatives that were costly and ineffective but remains committed to programs to boost the diversity of his company\u2019s workforce and customer base.\n\u201cYou have to separate the anti-DEI movement from what is really happening at the companies,\u201d White said. \u201cThere is clickbait and headlines that get people agitated, but the best leaders at the best companies are still trying to find ways to attract, hire and retain the very best talent available from the widest demographic set available to them.\u201d\nEmerson urged corporations to continue their efforts even in the face of legal and political headwinds.\n\u201cI want to remind all companies: You don\u2019t have to stop doing those things,\u201d Emerson said. \u201cThe things that have the biggest impact when hiring people from underrepresented backgrounds are things that are not only entirely legal, they are things that are in line with prioritizing the values of hard work and merit that the administration is touting in these executive orders.\u201d\n(This story was updated to add new information.)"

      "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1. Purpose and Policy. Over the past decade, Americans have witnessed a concerted and widespread effort to rewrite our Nation\u2019s history, replacing objective facts with a distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth. This revisionist movement seeks to undermine the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light. Under this historical revision, our Nation\u2019s unparalleled legacy of advancing liberty, individual rights, and human happiness is reconstructed as inherently racist, sexist, oppressive, or otherwise irredeemably flawed. Rather than fostering unity and a deeper understanding of our shared past, the widespread effort to rewrite history deepens societal divides and fosters a sense of national shame, disregarding the progress America has made and the ideals that continue to inspire millions around the globe.\nThe prior administration advanced this corrosive ideology. At Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania \u2014 where our Nation declared that all men are created equal \u2014 the prior administration sponsored training by an organization that advocates dismantling \u201cWestern foundations\u201d and \u201cinterrogating institutional racism\u201d and pressured National Historical Park rangers that their racial identity should dictate how they convey history to visiting Americans because America is purportedly racist.\nOnce widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement, the Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology. This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive. For example, the Smithsonian American Art Museum today features \u201cThe Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture,\u201d an exhibit representing that \u201c[s]ocieties including the United States have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement.\u201d The exhibit further claims that \u201csculpture has been a powerful tool in promoting scientific racism\u201d and promotes the view that race is not a biological reality but a social construct, stating \u201cRace is a human invention.\u201d\nThe National Museum of African American History and Culture has proclaimed that \u201chard work,\u201d \u201cindividualism,\u201d and \u201cthe nuclear family\u201d are aspects of \u201cWhite culture.\u201d The forthcoming Smithsonian American Women\u2019s History Museum plans on celebrating the exploits of male athletes participating in women\u2019s sports. These are just a few examples.\nIt is the policy of my Administration to restore Federal sites dedicated to history, including parks and museums, to solemn and uplifting public monuments that remind Americans of our extraordinary heritage, consistent progress toward becoming a more perfect Union, and unmatched record of advancing liberty, prosperity, and human flourishing. Museums in our Nation\u2019s capital should be places where individuals go to learn \u2014 not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history.\nTo advance this policy, we will restore the Smithsonian Institution to its rightful place as a symbol of inspiration and American greatness \u2013- igniting the imagination of young minds, honoring the richness of American history and innovation, and instilling pride in the hearts of all Americans.\nSec. 2. Saving Our Smithsonian. (a) The Vice President, in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and the Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Staff Secretary, Lindsey Halligan, Esq., shall work to effectuate the policies of this order through his role on the Smithsonian Board of Regents with respect to the Smithsonian Institution and its museums, education and research centers, and the National Zoo, including by seeking to remove improper ideology from such properties, and shall recommend to the President any additional actions necessary to fully effectuate such policies.\n(b) The Vice President and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall work with the Congress to ensure that future appropriations to the Smithsonian Institution:\n(i) prohibit expenditure on exhibits or programs that degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with Federal law and policy; and\n(ii) celebrate the achievements of women in the American Women\u2019s History Museum and do not recognize men as women in any respect in the Museum.\n(c) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of the Interior shall take any other measures within their authority to promote the policy of this order.\n(d) As appropriate, the Vice President shall, in consultation with the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and Special Assistant to the President and Senior Associate Staff Secretary, Lindsey Halligan, Esq., work with the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Senate Majority Leader, to seek the appointment of citizen members to the Smithsonian Board of Regents committed to advancing the policy of this order.\nSec. 3. Restoring Independence Hall. The Secretary of the Interior shall provide sufficient funding, as available, to improve the infrastructure of Independence National Historical Park, which shall be complete by July 4, 2026, the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.\nSec. 4. Restoring Truth in American History.\n(a) The Secretary of the Interior shall:\n(i) determine whether, since January 1, 2020, public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior\u2019s jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology;\n(ii) take action to reinstate the pre-existing monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties, as appropriate and consistent with 43 U.S.C. 1451 et seq., 54 U.S.C. 100101 et seq.,and other applicable law; and\n(iii) take action, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to ensure that all public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior\u2019s jurisdiction do not contain descriptions, depictions, or other content that inappropriately disparage Americans past or living (including persons living in colonial times), and instead focus on the greatness of the achievements and progress of the American people or, with respect to natural features, the beauty, abundance, and grandeur of the American landscape.\nSec. 5. General Provisions.
