      "title": "Via Bets on Connected Transit as It Heads to IPO",
      "summary": "Via Transportation’s IPO filing outlines a unified cloud‑based stack that merges trip planning, real‑time dispatch, eligibility checks and fare payments, positioning the company as a programmable transit platform. It cites an $82 billion serviceable market in North America and Western Europe, with revenue growing from $248.9 million in 2023 to $337.6 million in 2024 and 100% platform revenue in 2025. The platform enables agencies to consolidate disparate systems, cutting costs (e.g., a Florida agency saw a 50% drop in cost‑per‑ride) while offering dynamic pricing, subsidies and digital wallet payments. The filing notes that 14% of people use travel apps weekly, and Citymapper serves as the consumer front‑door for the service. Overall, the narrative frames modern transit as a software‑driven, data‑rich ecosystem that boosts efficiency, equity and rider experience.",
