  "content": "How Eric Trump Became One of Crypto's Greatest Evangelists\n\nThe real-estate executive has been at the vanguard of the first family's rapid entry into the cryptocurrency business.\n\nThe new probes represent an aggressive variation on efforts to use financial documents to take down opponents.\n\nThe agreement settles claims that the lender facilitated $800 million of payments related to the looting of the Malaysian sovereign-wealth fund.\n\nThe Fed chair opened the door for rate cuts next month when he said the labor market might be softening enough to rein in inflation that is being pushed up by tariffs.\n\nThe central bank retired a previous strategy and on Friday unveiled a new approach that updates how inflation and employment are balanced.\n\nThe Ivy League Keeps Failing This Basic Investing Test\n\nElite universities are again stuck with illiquid assets just when they badly need cash.\n\nApplied Value sets its expansion sights on private equity and the thousands of private equity-backed companies in need of expert advice.\n\nThe tax-and-spending legislation enacted in July has tax breaks for some savers but makes an already-complex process trickier.\n\nCompanies increasingly are failing to pay the bills they rack up in chapter 11 for goods and services, leaving suppliers and service providers to eat losses when bankruptcy restructurings don't go as expected.\n\nFind insight on Aegon, Mediobanca and more in the latest Market Talks covering financial services.\n\nProponents see Ethereum becoming the platform of choice for the financial world.\n\nShares of Intuit were down 5.1% in after hours trading following the results.",

  "summary": "The US Federal Reserve Chair, Rick Rick Rickard, has opened the door for rate cuts due to the softening of the labor market and potential increases in inflation. An agreement settles claims that the lender facilitated $800 million in payments related to the looting of a Malaysian sovereign-wealth fund. The tax-and-cheating legislation enacted in July has tax breaks for some savers but makes it difficult for companies to pay bills in chapter 11. The Ivy League continues to struggle with financial issues, with universities struggling to maintain their financial stability.",
