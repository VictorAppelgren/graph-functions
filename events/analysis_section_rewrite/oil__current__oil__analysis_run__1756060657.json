      "feedback": "Overall: solid acknowledgement of a 0–3 week horizon and the key militant/policy levers, but the causal chain is too loose, the numbers are underutilized, and the piece overweights Yemen-Israel signals for a Ukraine‑focused horizon; tighten the map, quantify where possible, and lay out explicit triggers and invalidation conditions. Actionable edits: reconstruct a clean 4‑step causal chain (frontline dynamics → Western policy/aid/actions → market and risk premia channels → price/volatility feedback) and cite each link to a source (e.g., Kursk incursion claims and prisoner swap from 9SQ5JOJKU; Western aid and potential ground presence from 9SQ5JOJKU; Red Sea/shipping disruption signals from I2SJU04DF and QOTVY47UC); explicitly label claims as contested where sources differ (e.g., Kyiv’s claimed Kursk gains vs Russian counterclaims) (9SQ5JOJKU; I2SJU04DF; QOTVY47UC). Add near-term catalysts with dates or windows (new Canadian military aid 2B CAD and contemplated ground forces; Norway Patriot/Radar funding) and tie them to market signals (defense spend, USD risk appetite, energy flows) (9SQ5JOJKU). Rebalance emphasis toward 0–3 weeks by pruning low‑probability Middle East inputs unless you explicitly frame them as global risk signals; if kept, treat NBX9RA9WX as a peripheral risk indicator rather than core driver. Quantify where possible: insert the concrete figures from sources (2B CAD in Ukraine aid; 7B NOK for air defense; 146 servicemen exchanged; 95 Ukrainian drones intercepted; 48 shot down) and describe them as “immediate policy/kinetic moves” and “headline risk” rather than generic statements (9SQ5JOJKU; I2SJU04DF; QOTVY47UC). For invalidation, specify explicit end‑points: a credible de‑escalation/diplomatic track or a durable Red Sea shipping corridor reopens that soothes risk premia; absence of any new Western aid/ sanctions move within 2–3 weeks or a large frontline shift should prompt scenario revision (07T878D0A; 9SQ5JOJKU; I2SJU04DF; QOTVY47UC). Strengthen the timing and thresholds: state key levels to monitor (frontline posture changes in Kursk Sudzha/ Donetsk axis; new sanctions/aid announcements; Red Sea port/shipping disruptions; energy-market responses) and outline what constitutes a clean invalidation versus a continuation scenario, then conclude with a concise, source‑anchored risk path. Citations to anchor every assertion: (9SQ5JOJKU) for Ukraine-Russia dynamics and aid signals, (I2SJU04DF) and (QOTVY47UC) for Yemen/Houthi/Israel tensions and shipping risk, (07T878D0A) for policy/long-range weapons debate, and (NBX9RA9WX) only as peripheral risk context if kept.",
