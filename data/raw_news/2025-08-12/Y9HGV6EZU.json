Today, the brand unveiled a new Ram 1500 concept race truck that previews the design for next year. Returning to the racetrack marks a major milestone, part of a pedal-to-the-metal drive for Ram that covers 25 product announcements over 18 months. The news of Ram\u2019s return to NASCAR was officially announced by Tim Kuniskis, CEO of Ram brand, during a live NASCAR event at the Michigan International Speedway this weekend. Jaw-dropping moments included a Ram 5500 hauling a custom trailer built specifically for smoky donuts, courtesy of Ram\u2019s NASCAR concept truck. Anderson Silva, Hall of Fame MMA icon, took to the track to shoot HEMI\u00ae-branded T-shirts into the crowd. \u201cFor more than a decade, customers and our dealer network asked about getting back into NASCAR. The desire was always there, but we didn\u2019t have a plan that delivered the last tenth and following just didn\u2019t fit our DNA,\u201d said Kuniskis. \u201cNow we have a solid plan that will set us apart from the field and will bring fresh new interest and engagement to America\u2019s motorsport.\u201d Joining the CRAFTSMAN Truck Series, in a way that only Ram can, is a natural, strategic move for the brand, as more than 40% of NASCAR fans are truck owners. The popular and competitive race series gives Ram a high-performance showcase as it launches a series of exciting and capable new trucks. \u201cRam returning to the NASCAR CRAFTSMAN Truck Series is a major moment for the sport, and a sign that NASCAR remains a strong platform for blue chip brand partners,\u201d said John Probst, NASCAR executive vice president and chief racing development officer. \u201cWe are excited to welcome Ram back to the sport. Its identity includes high performance, durability and innovation \u2013 characteristics that embody NASCAR and, specifically, the CRAFTSMAN Truck Series.\u201d Ram 1500 NASCAR Concept The Ram 1500 concept race truck unveiled today was molded by the Ram design team. The concept resembles a production truck, adopting elements from the Ram Truck Sport lineup (Warlock, Rebel and RHO), but honed with an aerodynamic signature to slip through the air efficiently, yet with enough airflow to cool a race engine that revs over 9,000 rpm. Body lines around the fenders and grille carry a familiar appearance, framing a large Ram logo that separates this truck from the pack. The one-off body design is covered by a two-tone Gloss Black canvas with Molten Red lower. The Ram design team created an impactful and exciting livery that complements the visual emotion of Ram\u2019s design DNA and highlights Direct Connection and Symbol of Protest logos. Mopar\u2019s Direct Connection aftermarket unit is adding performance options for Ram trucks and earns prominent signage on the concept race truck. \u201cThere will be more details on our NASCAR CRAFTSMAN Truck Series program later this year,\u201d added Kuniskis. \u201cWe are undoubtedly having fun with this project, and I truly look forward to sharing information on our team and how getting back on track relates to the future of Ram performance.\u201d In conjunction with the news, the brand showed off its \u201cRam-Demption\u201d campaign, featuring Kuniskis behind the wheel of Ram\u2019s NASCAR concept truck at Darlington Raceway in South Carolina, with the iconic Goodyear Blimp and jets flying overhead. Different versions of the \u201cRam-Demption\u201d video include 60-second, 30-second and 15-second spots that will run across NASCAR media and the Ram brand\u2019s social media channels, plus a long-form video running on www.ram.com and on YouTube. \u201cRam-Demption\u201d was created in partnership with Argonaut agency. Ram\u2019s racing news is part of a power celebration that includes a popular demand return of the 5.7-liter HEMI V-8, as orders open for the engine\u2019s availability in the 2026 Ram 1500. Ram exited factory support of NASCAR\u2019s CRAFTSMAN Truck Series in 2012 after a 17-year run and focused on launching the new 2013 Ram 1500. Ram\u2019s return is one part of a strategy to build on the greatest variety of sport trucks and off-road enthusiast trucks the brand has ever offered. Ram boasts a rich history of performance trucks, including the Power Wagon, SRT10 Viper Truck, TRX, RHO, Rumble Bee, Little Red Express and Warlock. In 2004, a Ram SRT-10, piloted by NASCAR driver Brendan Gaughan, set a Guinness World Record for the world's fastest production truck with an average speed of 154.587 mph (248.784 km/h) at the Stellantis Proving Grounds in Chelsea, Mich. Ram Brand Ram offers a full lineup of pickups and commercial vehicles: light-duty Ram 1500, heavy-duty 2500/3500, 3500/4500/5500 Chassis Cab and ProMaster vans. Ram light-duty and heavy-duty pickups offer products in the fastest growing segment within the pickup space\u2014Sport trucks.

Ram Professional is making considerable changes in process, execution and resources with a focus on commercial offerings, dedicated B2B-focused expertise, and sales and service support, which are critical to growing in this segment.
