  "title": "Fmr. Canada Trade Minister: 35% Tariffs Are Not Tenable",
  "description": "Former Canadian Minister of International Trade Mary Ng discusses the US Canada relationship amid a trade war and China implementing more levies on Canadian rapeseed. She speaks with Vonnie Quinn and Romaine Bostsick on \"The Close.\" (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Mary, Canada is facing difficulties on multiple fronts. Obviously, China in the news today. But you know, you've had a 25% tariff on non USMCA goods for several months at this point and the economy is suffering. What advice would you give to Mark Carney right now? Well, the prime Minister is at the negotiating table and and he and his team will continue to do that. And I think my advice would echo that of Canadians. It's really important that Canada gets a good deal and not just any deal. And I think Canada has a lot of advantages that that we should feel strong about. Part of that as well is how is it that we can continue to do the work here in Canada by being stronger, by being more competitive, by being more productive? All the things that the Prime Minister is currently doing and at the same time doing the work that's necessary to safeguard access to this important market, which, by the way, is not only good for candidates, actually also good for the United States as well. You're also waiting for a decision about lumber. Is it very pivotal in what way that decision comes down? I mean, obviously, in a sense it is. But there's also the possibility of giving subsidies to lumber producers, for example. But that's going to inflame tensions even more. So it's a real catch 22 situation, isn't it, Mary? While softwood lumber is a really important industry here in Canada because the forestry sector is so important to Canada. But I would also say to the Americans, as I have in the past and continue to do so, I know that you want to build homes and I want and I know that you want homes that are affordable. And when you make Canadian lumber more expensive into the United States, it just really makes building homes more expensive. Those are the conversations I've had, certainly with your home building associations in the past when I've gone down to America. And they would agree. So the question really is how do we find a path forward so that the supply continues to go into America? Yeah. And and that there's a there's a win win, essentially. But it's not tenable to have, you know, 35 plus percent tariffs on on an industry like this. It's not tenable to have 50% tariffs on, you know, on an important sector like steel or aluminum or copper, because the inputs that go into the United States ultimately are then borne and paid for by American businesses, manufacturers. Right. Importers. Well, well, this is what I'm curious about. Obviously, we have steel, you have autos, you have lumber. There are a lot of commodities and there's a lot of cross-border trade in that, not just one finished goods going back and forth, but you have a lot of raw materials that go into one country, get refined in some way, go back to the other, and then come back. That's like almost 70% of your trade right now is with the United States, or at least it was coming into this year, Mary. And I am curious as to what options you discussed before you left the administration there under Trudeau, what options were discussed and maybe what options are being discussed under Carney to supplement whatever might be lost with U.S.. Well, you know, I just want to pick up that point you just made about the integration, the nature of the integration of the market between Canada and the United States and the Canada-U.S. Mexico agreement, what you call USMCA. There we call it, because my here, the the good thing at the moment is that there is still Kuzma compliant or USA compliant that really is about you know according to the Bank of Canada just a few days ago covers over 90% of Canada's exports in United States and those are and really what does that mean? It just means that 75% of the content that needs to be created and you know, you're seeing that in sectors like whether it's energy or whether it is auto manufacturing. If you if we're able to keep to that Kuzma compliant then there really is no tariffs and I think that is that is really good for Canada and I think that that our administration our government needs to keep working with the Americans to ensure that there's a win win there. And and we are seeing that because I know that the American companies, because the supply chains are so integrated, do not want to see a higher cost borne on those inputs that go in and across the border, as you rightly pointed out several times before, finished goods made. But when we talk about what the relationship is going to look like and I don't necessarily mean just Canada, U.S., but really Canada's relationship with the world, I know that at least under Carney and I think it kind of started under Trudeau, there was some attempt at a reset with India and the relationship there to improve trade ties. I know there has been further outreach by Carney to other Asian nations, and I am curious as to do you think we're entering sort of a world where sort of one sort of big global trade environment is just no more, that this is going to be about regional blocs and in some cases, certainly on the U.S. side, more one on one bilateral type of trade deals and agreements. Well, the Americans have certainly decided to change the architecture and the way in which they're trading and the various relationships that they're having around the world. I as Canada's trade minister, I've been the longest serving trade minister in my country. I've never not had trade diversification in my mandate from the prime, from the Prime Minister. Canada has access to 65% of the world's economy through a network of free trade agreements right now. And we are doing a number of things right now in response to what the United States have put forward, and that is let's reduce some of that reliance, because I think in investment terms, you don't want to have all your eggs in one basket. You want to make sure that your portfolio is diversified. We have great partners through the CPP so that the, you know, the old TPP, the Trans-Pacific Partnership with countries like Japan and Australia and Singapore and Vietnam and all the rest, but also with Europe and, and, and a whole range of network. So I do think that there is an opportunity to diversify and and, and continue to create an economy that can work not only for Canada but for many of our global partners around the world. And I think that is the work for sure that's taking place right now. In the short term, though, it's going to hurt Mary before all of those relationships can be up and running. Right. So from Thursday, for example, China is putting on more than 75% tariffs on rapeseed. Now farmers are about to harvest what's going to be canola, right? What do they do with all of that if they can sell it to China and other places? You're going to have we're going have to look for new markets. I mean, the you know, the the getting tariffs on Canadian products that are not responsive to what we have always respected, which is an international rules based system, is just is just not good. So we are going to have to look at other markets. We're going to have to look at how we are stronger within Canada. There's a great piece of work that's being done by all the provinces and territories here in Canada around removing trade barriers. I would say to the world, look, I mean, Canada is a good place to invest. It's a good place to invest with a strong foundation of a rules based society, with great people and talent. And the kind of work that the Prime Minister now is doing is building big projects in this country, right? I mean, critical minerals to which we have you know, we have we have an abundance of those minerals that can be mined sustainably in our north. We have infrastructure projects that that can come online. We are a huge energy supplier and an energy mix that includes LNG, that includes a range of mixes, as you know, in this country. So there. Yes, you're totally right. It is going to be hard in the short term, even in the medium term. But I think that this is the hard work that we're going to need to do. And I don't think Canada's alone in this, quite candidly.",

  "summary": "Former Canada Trade Minister, Michael L. Ignativ\u00e9, has stated that 35% tariffs on non USMCA goods are not acceptable for Canada, despite the country's economy being hit by a 25% tariff on non-USMCA products. He also highlighted the need for Canada to secure a good deal with the United States, citing a potential decision on lumber subsidies as a crucial factor. L.A. suggests that giving subsidies to lumber producers could exacerbate tensions and inflame tensions. Largest tariffs on an industry like softwood lumber are not tenable, particularly on an important sector like steel or aluminum or copper, as inputs that go into the US ultimately pay for by American businesses, manufacturers. LAG decisions regarding lumber subsidies could also exacerbate tensions. The former trade minister also emphasized the importance of working with the American government to ensure the supply continues to flow into America. He highlighted the integration of the market between Canada and the US and India, highlighting the integration issue of the US-U.S. Mexico agreement, which covers over 90% of Canada's exports in the US, as well as the potential cost of tariffs. Lagging tariffs on imported raw materials, he said, were not acceptable. LALA imports cost Canada significantly less than imports, but the Bank of Canada maintains Kuzma compliant or USA compliant status, which means that 75% of the country\u2019s exports are imported.",
