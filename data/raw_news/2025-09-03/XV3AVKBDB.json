  "content": "Democratic member of \"the Squad,\" Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., unleashed on the United States and pro-Israel politicians in a fiery, expletive-filled speech at the \"People\u2019s Conference for Palestine\" in Detroit on Sunday.Tlaib, who is the first person of Palestinian descent to be elected to Congress, railed against Israeli leaders and supporters of Israel, shouting, \"I want to say to all of them, every genocide enabler, look at this room motherf---ers, we ain\u2019t going anywhere.\"  \"They thought they could rape us, kill us, violently uproot us from our olive tree farms, starve our children to death, and we would disappear. Well, guess what, now we\u2019re in Congress, and we\u2019re in every corner of the United States,\" she said, adding, \"We are just getting started.\"Tlaib also drilled into the United States as an \"empire in Washington, D.C.,\" saying, \"the political structures that I have to work in, that we all are surrounded by, was built on slavery and genocide and rape and oppression.\"AOC CAMPAIGN DENIES LINK TO WOMAN CHARGED WITH 'TERRORISTIC THREAT' AGAINST SCHOOL OVER JEWISH STUDENTSTaking aim at the Trump administration, Tlaib claimed that \"what\u2019s been tested on the killing fields of Gaza is already being deployed right here in the streets of America.\"\"What our government is willing to do to Palestinians, they are willing to do to all of you,\" she asserted. \"It is no surprise to me, as the daughter of Detroit, that I see our government, that has supplied the bombs and excuses Israel from destroying literally every single day hospitals, communities in Gaza, and manufacturing mass starvation, is also the same government that\u2019s defunding healthcare and food assistance programs here in our country.\"\"Gaza is the compass in this country,\" said Tlaib.Tlaib previously came under bipartisan criticism after sharing a video on social media that included the phrase \"From the river to the sea,\" a pro-Palestinian liberation slogan.'SQUAD' MEMBERS 'DECIDE TO LIE AND TWIST FACTS' ABOUT ISRAEL'S HISTORY, SAYS PROMINENT ARAB ACTIVISTIn 2023, the House of Representatives voted to censure Tlaib for anti-Israel comments made in the wake of the Jewish nation's war against Hamas. The People\u2019s Conference for Palestine, organized by a dozen pro-Palestinian groups, began Friday and ran through Sunday. Even before it started, the event drew scrutiny for featuring speakers with extremist views, including two former prisoners of Israel released in a Hamas deal.The conference opened on Friday afternoon with an elaborate ceremony, in which a speaker, after leading the crowd in chants, invited attendees to rise for \"our national anthem\" as a band began playing a song in a foreign language. People wearing keffiyehs proceeded in, holding Palestinian flags.During a panel at the conference, another speaker, Sachin Peddada, a Ph.D. student in economics and research coordinator at Progressive International, called the U.S. \"evil\" and repeatedly ripped on the country as an \"empire\" motivated by greed.'SQUAD' ERUPTS IN FURY AS TRUMP TAKES BOLD ACTION AGAINST IRANIAN NUCLEAR THREATPeddada urged the pro-Palestinian movement to \"destroy the idea of America in Americans\u2019 heads so that they can see the humanity of everybody outside the warping of American exceptionalism and imperialism and all these evil things.\"  \"To obfuscate that point or beat around the bush there does not serve us; we live in an evil country, that\u2019s just what\u2019s happening,\" he said as the crowd broke into applause.",

      "text": "Key facts about President Donald Trump: What to know\nDonald Trump served as the 45th President of the United States and was re-elected in 2024 to become the 47th President. He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022. Trump married Marla Maples in 1993, and they have one daughter, Tiffany Trump.\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest child of President Trump, has five children: Kai Trump, Donald J. Trump III, Tristan Trump, Spencer Trump, and Chloe Trump. Eric Trump is married to Lara Trump, who currently hosts FOX News Channel's \"My View with Lara Trump.\" Eric and Lara have two children, Eric Luke Trump and Carolina Trump. Ivanka Trump is married to Jared Kushner, and they have three children: Arabella Kushner, Joseph Kushner, and Theodore Kushner. Tiffany Trump welcomed her first child, Alexander Boulos, in 2025 with her husband, Michael Boulos."

Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., in a 234 - 188 vote on Tuesday night.\nThe punishment, while largely symbolic, was a formal public rebuke of her most recent anti-Israel comments made in the wake of the Jewish nation\u2019s war against terror group Hamas.\nTwenty-two Democrats voted with 212 Republicans to censure Tlaib. Four GOP lawmakers voted against the measure. Four lawmakers voted present. The measure was introduced by freshman Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., on Monday.\n\"If this is not worthy of censure, what is? When you can call for the annihilation of a country and its people, if that\u2019s not worthy of a censure, what is?\" McCormick said on the House floor Tuesday.\nIn the text of his resolution, the Georgia Republican accused Tlaib of \"promoting false narratives regarding the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and for calling for the destruction of the state of Israel.\"\nTlaib, the only Palestinian American in Congress, has come under bipartisan criticism after sharing a video on social platform X that included the phrase \"From the river to the sea,\" a pro-Palestinian liberation slogan.\nHer critics have pointed out that the rallying cry implicitly calls for the destruction of Israel as a state. Hamas has also co-opted the phrase.\n\"It is fundamentally a call for a Palestinian state extending from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, territory that includes the State of Israel, which would mean the dismantling of the Jewish state,\" the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s website says. \"It is an antisemitic charge denying the Jewish right to self-determination, including through the removal of Jews from their ancestral homeland.\"\nTLAIB ACCUSES BIDEN OF SUPPORTING \u2018GENOCIDE\u2019 OF PALESTINIANS, WARNS: \u2018WE WILL REMEMBER IN 2024\u2019\nTlaib has remained unrepentant over her use of the phrase.\n\"It is important to separate people and governments,\" she said on the House floor earlier in the day. \"The idea that criticizing the Israeli government is antisemitic sets a dangerous precedent.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe House voted to advance McCormick\u2019s resolution earlier on Tuesday, when a vote to kill the measure was defeated 208 to 213, with one lawmaker voting \"present.\"\nA resolution to censure Tlaib, brought by Rep.

      "text": "Members of the \"Squad\" are undermining coexistence between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East, Israeli-Arab activist Yoseph Haddad told Fox News Digital.\n\"Representatives of the Squad are trying to harm the coexistence and partnership that exist in the region between Arabs and Jews,\" Haddad said. \"I think it was [Alexandria] Ocasio-Cortez herself who said she had no idea about the geopolitics of this region\u2014she\u2019s right. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib know exactly what\u2019s going on here, but they decide to lie and twist the facts.\"\nHaddad, the CEO of Together Vouch for Each Other \u2014 an organization founded in 2018 by young Israeli Arabs to bridge cultural and religious divides \u2014 has emerged as a prominent voice in Israel\u2019s public diplomacy efforts following Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 massacre.\nSince the attack, Jewish communities across the United States and Europe have faced a sharp rise in antisemitic incidents, with pro-Hamas demonstrations appearing on college campuses as early as October 8.\nLAWSUIT ALLEGES ANTI-ISRAEL GROUP LEADERS ARE 'HAMAS' FOOT SOLDIERS IN NEW YORK CITY'\n\"The first group is what I call the useful idiots \u2014 people who have no idea what\u2019s going on but joined because it felt like the cool thing to do,\" Haddad said. \"Then there are the paid protesters. You see the same faces at different rallies holding different signs \u2014 sometimes it\u2019s about LGBTQ issues, sometimes it\u2019s pro-Palestinian, sometimes it\u2019s about internal American problems.\"\n\"It\u2019s always the same person, just a different outfit and a different sign,\" he continued. \"And the third group \u2014 the most dangerous\u2014are the extremists who\u2019ve come from the Middle East. Those are the ones we should be most concerned about.\"\nHaddad traced the rise of extremist voices in the West to waves of immigration and population displacement from conflict zones in the Middle East. While the majority of Muslim immigrants fled persecution in search of a better life, he said, a vocal minority brought with them the ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood, effectively holding their communities hostage.\n\"When you have so many immigrants all around the world, it\u2019s enough for 10 or 20 percent of them to be extremists \u2014 and suddenly, you\u2019re dealing with millions of extremists,\" he said.\n\"Ostriches, when there is a danger and there is a problem, what they do is they stick their head in the sand thinking the problem will just pass because nobody will notice them,\" he added. \"And this is what the weak governments are doing right now, becoming like an ostrich. The only problem is that no one will skip them over, it will make it easier to chop their heads off.\"\nAddressing accusations that Israel enforces an apartheid system between Jews and Arabs, Haddad rejected the comparison outright.\nHARVARD DEAN'S COUNCIL MEMBER RESIGNS FROM POST AFTER LAWSUIT CLAIMS HE 'AIDED AND ABETTED' HAMAS\n\"In real apartheid, like in South Africa, everything was segregated \u2014 transportation, hospitals, courts, sports, even walking on the sidewalks,\" Haddad said. \"But if you actually come to Israel and see life here, it\u2019s the complete opposite \u2014 180 degrees different.\"\n\"Stop speaking from a place of emotion \u2014 that\u2019s exactly what The Squad is doing,\" he continued. \"Start talking about facts. Then you\u2019ll realize that anyone who concludes Israel is an apartheid state is an imbecile.\"\nHe also mentioned a run-in he had with a protester, who he refers to as \"the useful idiots.\"\nThey have no clue \u2026 One time, I read the charter of Hamas to some pro-Palestinian useful idiot, I read it to them, and I said you agree to this, and they said no, no, no I didn\u2019t know that. And I said yes, but this is what you are supporting, and he had the headband of Hamas on his head. You understand that this is what you are supporting.\n\"He literally took the band off after that. Such useful idiots like this you have a lot, not just in the United States, you can see it in Europe as well.\"\nWhen asked what he believes the Palestinians ultimately want, Haddad pointed to slogans often heard at anti-Israel and antisemitic protests, such as \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free\" and \"There is only one solution: Intifada revolution.\"\n\"The majority of Palestinians do not want to live side by side with Israel,\" Haddad said. \"So when people talk about a two-state solution and question Israel\u2019s commitment, I say: Don\u2019t ask the Israelis \u2014 ask the Palestinians. You\u2019ll be shocked to find that many of them aren\u2019t willing to accept it.\"\nHaddad pointed out that history can be approached in multiple ways \u2014 through religious texts like the Torah for Jews, the Bible for Christians and the Quran for Muslims. Even those who are atheists can look to history books for evidence of the deep-rooted connection of the Jewish people to the land of Israel.\nHaddad argued that the Torah explicitly mentions the presence of Jews in Israel, tracing their presence back thousands of years. He also highlighted the Biblical reference to the birthplace of Jesus in Jewish Bethlehem, challenging the notion that Palestinian Muslims have a historical claim to the land before the Jews.\nHaddad noted that while Jerusalem is never mentioned in the Quran, the term \"sons of Israel\" appears more than 43 times. He also emphasized that the name \"Palestine\" was imposed by the Romans as a punishment for the Bar Kokhba revolt.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHaddad highlighted that in 1947, Arabs had the opportunity to establish a Palestinian state through the U.N. Partition Plan, which the Jews accepted despite receiving less land and fewer resources. However, the Arabs rejected the plan and opted to wage war. When the Jews emerged victorious, 156,000 Arabs remained within what became Israel. Sharing his personal connection to this history, Haddad explained that his grandfather was one of those Arabs who stayed and eventually became part of the Arab Israeli identity.\n\"It\u2019s either you accept the fact that Israel exists and is here to stay, or you continue with this cycle of bloodshed and death that we are trying to escape,\" said Haddad. \"But the ones who will suffer the most are you, the Palestinians, whether in the West Bank or Gaza.\"\nSeveral requests for comment sent to Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib and Omar were not returned."

It is home to many holy sites and has deep religious roots dating back to biblical times. Bordered by Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria, Israel is roughly the size of New Jersey.\nBenjamin Netanyahu, from the right-wing Likud party, is the longest-serving prime minister of Israel. He previously served as prime minister from 1996 to 1999 and later from 2009 to 2021, before returning to the role in 2022.\nThe State of Israel was established in 1948 and was officially admitted to the United Nations (UN) in 1949. Israel has a long-standing conflict with Arab states and the Palestinians, characterized by years of violence and terrorist attacks against the Jewish state.\nOn Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorists launched a deadly attack on Israel, prompting Israel to formally declare war on Hamas. In June 2025, Israel launched strikes aimed at Iran's nuclear facilities and top military leaders. On June 13, 2025, Israel initiated strikes targeting nuclear sites in Iran, marking the beginning of fire exchanges between the two nations and the start of the Israel-Iran war. In retaliation for U.S. strikes against its nuclear program, Iran launched at least 14 missiles toward Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. According to President Donald Trump, the United States carried out strikes on three of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities in Operation Midnight Hammer on June 22, 2025."

According to the outlet, Abdul worked on the \"Squad\" member\u2019s Democratic primary campaign as a youth organizer in the summer of 2018. State Sen. Julia Salazar reportedly told the Post that Abdul also worked on Salazar's campaign during that timeframe as a paid canvasser.\nOcasio-Cortez's campaign office denied that Abdul was ever a campaign staffer.\n\"This person was never staff on the campaign and any representation of such is false,\" the campaign said in a statement. \"Their comments are appalling and we condemn threats of violence without hesitation.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nReached by Fox News Digital, Abdul's attorney, Geoffrey St. Andrew Stewart, declined to comment on the case."

      "text": "A controversial pro-Palestinian gathering in Detroit is drawing scrutiny for featuring speakers with extremist views\u2014including two former Israeli prisoners released in a Hamas deal\u2014alongside Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., a prominent anti-Israel congresswoman.\nThe second annual \"People's Conference for Palestine\" conference, which is being organized by a dozen different pro-Palestinian groups, will begin Friday afternoon and will end on Sunday.\nRep. Tlaib will speak alongside several individuals accused of espousing antisemitic rhetoric, including a professor who has compared Jews to Nazis, a journalist who quipped about Hamas kidnapping \"several dozen hipsters\" at \"some sort of rave\" on Oct. 7, 2023, and a high-profile activist who once said Israel is \"built on the idea that Jews are supreme to everyone else\" and lost her position on the board of a major philanthropic organization amid antisemitism complaints.\nDNC SUMMER MEETING DERAILED AFTER TENSIONS FLARE OVER DUELING RESOLUTIONS: \u2018LOSING OUR FUTURE\u2019\nTlaib, herself, has been no stranger to criticism about her anti-Israel views either. She was censured in 2023 by her colleagues in Congress over alleged inflammatory rhetoric about the Israel-Hamas war. The censure followed several comments from Tlaib that drew backlash, including her use of the phrase \"From the river to the sea,\" a slogan that many Israel supporters consider a call for the destruction of Israel.\nTlaib also came under fire in 2023 for being part of a secret Facebook group for many years that glorified terrorists following the attacks on Israel on October 7, 2023.\nThe congresswoman will be joined at the conference by two former prisoners held by Israel who gained their freedom through an Israeli prisoner swap with Hamas. One of those individuals, Hussam Shaheen, was sentenced by Israeli authorities to almost 30 years in prison during the early 2000s for murder and conspiracy to commit murder.\nThe other former prisoner, Omar Assaf, was formerly an official of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP). The DFLP is not a U.S.-designated terror group, but it has been targeted by U.S. sanctions.\nWHITE HOUSE DEMANDS ALL GAZA HOSTAGES RETURN HOME \u2018THIS WEEK\u2019 AMID STALLED TALKS\nOther attendees of this weekend's conference include Raja Abdulhaq, who is listed on the conference's website as the co-founder of the Quds News Network (QNN), which was suspended from Twitter in 2019 for alleged ties to terrorism, a company spokesperson reportedly told the Times of Israel. Subsequently, other major social media platforms, like Instagram, Facebook and TikTok, all took steps to restrict QNN's presence on their platforms.\nWesam Ahmed, another speaker, is listed as a \"human rights advocate\" with Al-Haq, an entity accused by the Israeli government of having ties to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).\nMeanwhile, Michigan-area activist and former candidate for Congress, Huwaida Arraf, is also slated to speak. Arraf is known for being a co-founder of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), which has previously been investigated by the FBI for possible ties to terrorists. In 2021, Arraf also penned an article which promoted using violent tactics against Israelis.\n\"The Palestinian resistance must take on a variety of characteristics \u2014 both nonviolent and violent,\" she wrote at the time. \"But most importantly it must develop a strategy involving both aspects.\"\nHowever, when reached for comment, Arraf shot back at criticism that she may be antisemitic, arguing any accusations of such are \"meant to smear and silence Palestinians and anyone who dares to speak up for their rights.\"\n\"My record is clear,\" she added. \"I have spent my life opposing all forms of racism, discrimination, and oppression. Conflating criticism of a government with hatred of a people is dishonest and dangerous\u2014it weaponizes antisemitism instead of confronting it.\"\nA Michigan high school principal was forced to apologize to students and parents in 2023 after Arraf went off script at a \"diversity assembly\" and reportedly attacked Israel.\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION DEMANDS $1B SETTLEMENT FROM UCLA OVER CAMPUS ANTISEMITISM CLAIMS\nMultiple university professors accused of antisemitism will also be at the event with Tlaib. One of them, Hatem Bazian, came under fire by his university, the University of California \u2013 Berkley, in 2017 after he shared an anti-Israel cartoon that drew widespread backlash for comparing Jews to Nazis, among other tropes.\n\"Mom, look! I is chosen! I can now kill, rape, smuggle organs & steal the land of Palestinians yay #Ashke-Nazi,\" read the caption of a political cartoon shared by Bazian, the chairman of American Muslims for Palestine and the co-founder of Students for Justice in Palestine.\nThe caption was layered over an image of an orthodox Jewish individual who was juxtaposed next to an image of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un wearing a kippah and other traditional Jewish garb. That photo was also layered with its own caption: \"Donald Trump: Now my nukes are legal & I can annex South Korea & you need to start paying me 34 billion a year in welfare.\"\nIn 2015, Bazian, whose SJP group has fueled anti-Israel riots on college campuses, raised alarm bells when he called for an \"intifada in this country that changes fundamentally the political dynamics in here,\" which is widely interpreted as calling for violence against Jews. He went on to say, \"They're gonna say some Palestinian being too radical \u2013 well, you haven't seen radicalism yet.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nAnother speaker at the event, journalist Eugene Puryear, has been slammed for trivializing Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023, attacks that killed over a thousand innocent Israelis.\n\"As you might have seen, there was some sort of rave or desert party where they were having a great time, until the resistance came in electrified hang gliders and took at least several dozen hipsters,\" Puryear said on Oct. 8, one day after the attack, according to a report from the Anti-Defamation League.\nLinda Sarsour, who had to walk-back her remarks after stating Israel \"is built on the idea that Jews are supreme to everyone else,\" and lost her seat on the board of the Women's March amid allegations of antisemitism, will make an appearance as well on Friday afternoon. Sarsour previously denied the allegations of antisemitism that came during her time with the Women's March.\n\"Ask them this, how can you be against white supremacy in America and the idea of being in a state based on race and class, but then you support a state like Israel that is based on supremacy, that is built on the idea that Jews are supreme to everyone else,\" Sarsour asked a crowd in 2019, according to Israeli news outlet Haaretz.\nMahmoud Khalil, the former Columbia University student who the Trump administration tried to deport for allegedly inciting anti-Israel violence on his campus, will also be in attendance.\nIn addition to the speakers, the organizers added special programming geared for kids. \"We're proud to introduce a two-day Children\u2019s Program for ages 6\u201312, featuring engaging activities and an educational curriculum that explores Palestinian history, culture, and resistance,\" the conference's website says.\nFox News Digital reached out to the conference for comment on its list of speakers, but did not immediately receive a response. Fox News Digital also reached out to several of the speakers for comment but, with the exception of Arraf, did not immediately hear back.\nFox News' Cameron Cawthorne and Andrew Mark Miller contributed to this report"

      "text": "A panelist speaking at the \"People's Conference for Palestine\" in Detroit on Friday called the United States \"an evil country\" and expressed a need to \"destroy the idea of America in Americans\u2019 heads.\"\nSpeaking on a panel titled \"No Weapons for Genocide: The People Demand an Arms Embargo,\" Sachin Peddada, a Ph.D. student in economics and research coordinator at Progressive International, repeatedly ripped on the United States as an \"empire\" motivated by greed.\nIn response to a question about how Americans can get more involved, Peddada paraphrased a quote by deceased Palestinian author Bassel al-Araj, saying, \"The average American will never understand the plight of the Palestinian person because the state of Israel is a carbon copy of the United States.\n\"And, therefore, the thing to do is to destroy the idea of America in Americans\u2019 heads so that they can see the humanity of everybody outside the warping of American exceptionalism and imperialism and all these evil things.\"\nAs Peddada said these words, the crowd broke into applause.\nWHITE HOUSE DEMANDS ALL GAZA HOSTAGES RETURN HOME 'THIS WEEK' AMID STALLED TALKS\nPeddada continued, saying, \"We have to dismantle this idea of American exceptionalism, of supremacy, of being beyond reproach.\n\"I think it\u2019s very important that we normalize criticism as a healthy process and learn from our experiments in the world to push the boundaries of what is possible, to continue to fight for more and more and to see how the empire responds to us, to continue to push farther and harder.\"\nAt another point during the panel, Peddada declared, \"We live in an evil country.\"\nHe said that, since Oct. 7, 2023, \"We can say with certainty that the U.S. has been the most complicit country \u2014 complicit is not even the right word to use \u2014 but the most responsible country for what is happening not only in Gaza but also the West Bank and also all over the global south.\"\nPeddada claimed that the U.S. is a country that has \"functionally for decades been the sole superpower of the world\" and has \"an agenda that is driven primarily by the accumulation of profit at the expense of human lives.\nCOLUMBIA PROFESSOR WHO CALLED OCT. 7 HAMAS ATTACKS 'AWESOME' TO TEACH COURSE ON ZIONISM\n\"To obfuscate that point or beat around the bush there does not serve us; we live in an evil country, that\u2019s just what\u2019s happening,\" he said as the crowd again broke into applause.\n\"That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re all evil,\" he added. \"But it does mean we have a unique responsibility. We have a unique position here in the heart of the empire to act in solidarity with all of our siblings in Gaza and in the West Bank, all around the world.\"\nCommenting on the remarks, one user on X posted, \"As an American, I find this galling.\"\n\"My culture and history have already been relentlessly attacked \u2014 statues of Washington, Jefferson, and other Founders torn down as \u2018controversial,\u2019\" he said. \"Now we have conference speakers openly talking about \u2018destroying the idea of America.\u2019\"\nSQUAD MEMBERS SUED FOR 'INCITING' COLUMBIA ANTI-ISRAEL ENCAMPMENT\nThe People\u2019s Conference for Palestine, organized by a dozen pro-Palestinian groups, began Friday and will run through Sunday. Even before it started, the gathering drew scrutiny for featuring speakers with extremist views, including two former prisoners of Israel released in a Hamas deal, alongside Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., a prominent anti-Israel congresswoman.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe conference opened Friday afternoon with an elaborate opening ceremony, in which a speaker, after leading the crowd in chants, invited attendees to rise for \"our national anthem\" as a band began playing a song in a foreign language. People wearing keffiyehs proceeded in, holding Palestinian flags.\nFox News Digital reached out to Progressive International and the People's Conference for Palestine for comment but did not immediately receive a response.\nFox News Digital's Alec Schemmel contributed to this report."

  "argos_summary": "Rep. Rashida Tlaib delivered a fiery, profanity\u2011laden speech at a pro\u2011Palestinian conference in Detroit, calling pro\u2011Israel politicians \"genocide enablers\" and asserting that the U.S. is complicit in the Gaza conflict. She reiterated her longstanding anti\u2011Israel stance, including the slogan \"From the river to the sea,\" and warned that the U.S. government is defunding aid to Palestinians while supporting Israel\u2019s military actions. The speech has intensified criticism of Tlaib, who was already censured by Congress in 2023 for similar remarks, and has drawn attention to the broader debate over U.S. foreign policy and domestic political polarization.",
