  "description": "Just because a business does not make any money, does not mean that the stock will go down. Indeed, Cartier Resources...",
  "content": "Just because a business does not make any money, does not mean that the stock will go down. Indeed, Cartier Resources (CVE:ECR) stock is up 191% in the last year, providing strong gains for shareholders. But while history lauds those rare successes, those that fail are often forgotten; who remembers Pets.com?\n\nGiven its strong share price performance, we think it's worthwhile for Cartier Resources shareholders to consider whether its cash burn is concerning. In this report, we will consider the company's annual negative free cash flow, henceforth referring to it as the 'cash burn'. First, we'll determine its cash runway by comparing its cash burn with its cash reserves.\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nWhen Might Cartier Resources Run Out Of Money?\n\nA cash runway is defined as the length of time it would take a company to run out of money if it kept spending at its current rate of cash burn. As at June 2025, Cartier Resources had cash of CA$11m and no debt. In the last year, its cash burn was CA$4.4m. Therefore, from June 2025 it had 2.5 years of cash runway. Arguably, that's a prudent and sensible length of runway to have. The image below shows how its cash balance has been changing over the last few years.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Cartier Resources\n\nHow Is Cartier Resources' Cash Burn Changing Over Time?\n\nBecause Cartier Resources isn't currently generating revenue, we consider it an early-stage business. So while we can't look to sales to understand growth, we can look at how the cash burn is changing to understand how expenditure is trending over time. Over the last year its cash burn actually increased by a very significant 68%. Oftentimes, increased cash burn simply means a company is accelerating its business development, but one should always be mindful that this causes the cash runway to shrink. Admittedly, we're a bit cautious of Cartier Resources due to its lack of significant operating revenues. So we'd generally prefer stocks from this list of stocks that have analysts forecasting growth.\n\nGiven its cash burn trajectory, Cartier Resources shareholders may wish to consider how easily it could raise more cash, despite its solid cash runway. Companies can raise capital through either debt or equity. Many companies end up issuing new shares to fund future growth. We can compare a company's cash burn to its market capitalisation to get a sense for how many new shares a company would have to issue to fund one year's operations.",

  "argos_summary": "Cartier Resources has seen a 191% share price rise in the past year despite operating at a negative free cash flow of CA$4.4\u202fmillion, giving it a 2.5\u2011year cash runway with CA$11\u202fmillion in reserves and no debt. The company\u2019s cash burn has surged 68% year\u2011over\u2011year, reflecting accelerated development but also shrinking runway, and its lack of revenue raises caution for investors. While the firm remains debt\u2011free and has a solid balance sheet, shareholders should monitor its ability to raise additional capital to sustain growth.",
