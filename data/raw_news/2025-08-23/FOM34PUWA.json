  "content": "Aug. 23\u2014GRAND FORKS \u2014 In 2014, the Grand Forks Herald reported that the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International estimated that some 100,000 UAS-related jobs would be created in the U.S. by 2025 and would create an economic impact of $82 billion. At that time, AUVSI also projected that North Dakota would see more than 100 new jobs and an economic impact of $10.2 million because of the UAS sector by this year.\n\nHowever, AUVSI has since stopped tracking those numbers because its researchers realized they did not portray an accurate picture of the impact, according to spokesperson Ryan Carver. The organization now considers those numbers \"defunct.\"\n\nSo what economic impact has the UAS industry had on Grand Forks and North Dakota? For a number of reasons, that's a difficult question to answer.\n\nFor starters, much of the work being done by companies like General Atomics and Northrop Grumman is proprietary or confidential, and so those companies presumably wouldn't report all data associated with that work in voluntary surveys.\n\nBut also, there's no standard way that the industry groups UAS-related occupations for data purposes, according to Tom Swoyer, president of\n\nFor example, Swoyer said, an employer might officially categorize themselves under \"light manufacturing,\" but they're building drones. Also, a company like Northrop Grumman might be doing hundreds of millions of dollars of work in Grand Forks County \u2014 but because the contracts for the work were signed in California, for example, that work would show up in California's economic data, not North Dakota's.\n\nThe Grand Forks Region Economic Development Corporation tracks a cluster of UAS-related jobs each year and also distributes a voluntary employment survey to the region's UAS employers. The EDC tracks the same data every year, and so the data is consistent. But for the reasons outlined by Swoyer, attempts to track that data are \"imperfect,\" according to Kevin Hatcher, business development manager of the EDC.\n\nThe EDC's 2025 numbers show a 97% increase in UAS-related jobs in the U.S. in the last decade. According to that data, there were 712 UAS-related jobs in the U.S. in 2015, compared to 1,400 in 2025, with an average salary of $105,912.\n\nAt the local level, more granular data is difficult to come by. Grand Forks County Administrator Tom Ford said the county hasn't tracked that kind of data in a number of years.\n\nLandon Johnson, UAS business development manager for the North Dakota Department of Commerce, said the state doesn't centrally track UAS economic impact, although he plans to rectify that in the future.",
