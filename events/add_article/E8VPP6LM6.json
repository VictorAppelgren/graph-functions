      "summary": "On August 21, 2025, India passed legislation banning real‑money online gaming, requiring the President’s signature before it takes effect. The law would render the company’s Indian operations illegal, prompting it to pursue legal challenges and seek injunctive relief while the case proceeds. Clairvest’s forward‑looking statements note that the legislation could materially affect the company’s prospects and that the company intends to contest its validity. The release underscores the company’s intent to defend its business model against the new regulatory regime.",
