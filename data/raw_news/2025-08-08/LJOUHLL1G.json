  "content": "Hi, thanks as always for reading TechCrunch. We want to talk with you quickly about something important.\n\nWe\u2019ve discovered that scammers are impersonating TechCrunch reporters and event leads and reaching out to companies, pretending to be our staff when they absolutely are not. These bad actors are using our name and reputation to try to dupe unsuspecting businesses. It drives us crazy and infuriates us on your behalf.\n\nAnecdotally, this isn\u2019t just happening to us; fraudsters are exploiting the trust that comes with established news brands to get their foot in the door with companies across the media industry.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of the most common scheme we\u2019ve been tracking: impostors impersonating our reporters to extract sensitive business information from unsuspecting targets. In several cases we know about, scammers have adopted the identity of actual staff members, crafting what looks like a standard media inquiry about a company\u2019s products and requesting an introductory call.\n\nSharp-eyed recipients sometimes catch discrepancies in email addresses that don\u2019t match our real employees\u2019 credentials. But these schemes evolve quickly; bad actors keep refining their tactics, mimicking reporters\u2019 writing styles and referencing startup trends to make their pitches increasingly convincing. Equally troubling: victims who agree to phone interviews tell us the fraudsters use those calls to dig for even more proprietary details.\n\nWhy are they doing this? We don\u2019t know, though a reasonable guess is that these are groups looking for initial access to a network.\n\nAs for what to do about it, if someone reaches out claiming to be from TechCrunch and you have even the slightest doubt about whether they\u2019re legitimate, please don\u2019t just take their word for it. We\u2019ve made it easy for you to verify.\n\nStart by checking our staff page. It\u2019s the quickest way to see if the person contacting you actually works here. If the individual\u2019s name isn\u2019t on our roster, you\u2019ve got your answer right there.\n\nIf you do see someone\u2019s name on our staff page, but our employee\u2019s job description doesn\u2019t square with the request you are receiving (i.e., a TechCrunch copy editor is suddenly very interested in learning about your business!), a bad actor is trying to con you.\n\nIf it sounds like a legitimate request but you want to make doubly certain, you should also feel free to contact us directly and just ask (you can learn how to reach each writer, editor, sales exec, marketing guru, and events team member in our bios).\n\nWe know it\u2019s frustrating to have to double-check media inquiries, but these groups are counting on you not taking that extra step. By being vigilant about verification, you\u2019re not just protecting your own company \u2014 you\u2019re helping preserve the trust that legitimate journalists depend on to do their jobs.",
