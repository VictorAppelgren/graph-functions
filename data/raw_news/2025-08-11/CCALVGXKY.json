Generate Key Takeaways\n\nHairless French Bulldog Crowned 'World's Ugliest Dog' Was Rescued From Horrific Backyard Breeding originally appeared on PetHelpful.\n\nEvery August, thousands of dog parents and animal fans gather at the Sonoma County Fairgrounds to watch the crowning of the 'World's Ugliest Dog.' This event, which has been held for nearly 50 years, aims to recognize and celebrate the imperfections that make every dog unique, and this year's competitors did not disappoint.\n\nDogs of all sizes, abilities, and backgrounds are celebrated at this one-of-a-kind event, but only one dog can be crowned the 'ugliest.' As this year's winner proved, though, 'ugly' is sometimes he most beautiful thing you can be!\n\nPetunia is a 2-year-old hairless French Bulldog mix who lives with her human and canine friends at Luvable Dog Rescue in Eugene, Oregon. Not long ago, she was rescued from an unthinkable situation, but now she's living her best life like the queen she is.\n\nOn August 8, she was officially crowned the World's Ugliest Dog!\n\nUgly who? This hairless dog is adorable! Her handler, Shannon Nyman, summed her up perfectly when she told TODAY, \"She's a mix between Yoda, she's a mix between a hippo, a bat \u2014 she's got it all.\"\n\nNow she has a crown, too! Each of this year's competitors, from thin-haired Chinese Crested pups to senior Chihuahuas who can't keep their tongues in their mouths, was just as unique as Petunia.\n\nRelated: Hairless Xolo-French Bulldog Mix Crawling Into Foster Dad's Lap For the First Time Could Melt Any Heart\n\n\"The reporter who said 'I'm still waiting to see an ugly dog,' is so real,\" one commenter admitted. \"Also, Petunia is a stunner! Winners win, but she's not ugly at all!\"\n\nYou can say that again! This precious pup has all the hallmark wrinkles of a French Bulldog, and her adorable peach fuzz could leave anyone smiling from ear to ear. Given her charming personality, though, it's really no surprise that she took home first place.\n\nEach of the ten finalists strutted their stuff in front of four judges, who scored them all based on looks, stage presence, backstory, and their MUG Root Beer red carpet appearance. When you hear this rescue dog's story, though, it's easy to see how she stole everyone's hearts.\n\nNyman is a volunteer at Luvable Dog Rescue, which rescued Petunia, along with 50 other dogs, from a horrific backyard breeding situation in May of this year. The dogs were living in crates in a Las Vegas backyard, and many of them, like her, are experiencing lifelong health complications.\n\nHer unique looks, although charming, are the result of unethical breeding and long-term neglect.\n\nNyman explains, \"Most of these bully breeds are being irresponsibly bred, unethically bred, so they have what's called BOAS \u2014 brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome \u2014 so they need to get their soft palate reduced in order for them to breathe and function well.\"\n\nFortunately, 'Pinky' Petunia, whose skin was a bright pink color when she was first rescued, underwent a successful surgery after her rescue. She is now a healthy and happy dog who enjoys breathing normally and getting daily spa treatments from her rescue family.\n\nNow that she's been crowned the World's Ugliest Dog, everyone knows just what a queen this rescue dog is. Congratulations, Petunia!\n\n\n\nLooking for more PetHelpful updates? Follow us on YouTube for more entertaining videos.

      "text": "The 2025 winner of the World's Ugliest Dog Contest has bloomed into an adorably quirky champion after being rescued from living in a crate in a neglected situation.\nIt's only fitting her name is Petunia.\nThe 2-year-old hairless French bulldog mix appeared live on TODAY alongside handler Shannon Nyman on Aug. 11. She basked in her victory, three days after winning $5,000, a spot on limited-edition cans from sponsor Mug Root Beer and the coveted bragging rights for being selected as the World's Ugliest Dog.\n\"I think she's feeling great,\" Nyman said on TODAY. \"She loves all the attention, she loves all the affection, all the humans petting her.\"\nPetunia beat out nine other dogs at this year's contest on Aug. 8 at the Sonoma County Fair in Santa Rosa, California. A panel of four judges, including NBC News correspondent Gadi Schwartz, scrutinized the dogs based on looks, stage presence, backstory and how well they graced the red carpet.\n\"She's a mix between Yoda, she's a mix between a hippo, a bat \u2014 she's got it all,\" Schwartz said on TODAY.\n\"She's a total creature,\" Nyman told Schwartz about Petunia during the contest.\nThe contest, which has been celebrating imperfection for nearly 50 years, advocates for adopting dogs instead of buying them from breeders. Petunia and many of the other contestants are rescue dogs from shelters and puppy mills.\nPetunia is cared for by the Luvable Dog Rescue in Eugene, Oregon, where Nyman is a volunteer.\n\"Even a wonky dog deserves to be loved,\" Nyman said. \"And that's what we prefer to call them: not ugly, wonky.\"\nPetunia was rescued from a backyard breeder situation in Las Vegas where the owner was hoarding more than 50 dogs that were living in crates, according to Nyman. Petunia is hairless because of the unethical breeding practices she endured before she was rescued.\n\"Most of these bully breeds are being irresponsibly bred, unethically bred, so they have what's called BOAS \u2014 brachycephalic obstructive airway syndrome \u2014 so they need to get their soft palate reduced in order for them to breathe and function well,\" Nyman said.\nPetunia had BOAS after spending the first two years of her life in a crate. Rescued in May, she was given surgery to fix her breathing and is now happy and healthy.\nShe now gets daily coconut oil treatments after initially having a reddish hue that had the volunteers at Luvable Dog Rescue dubbing her Pinky Petunia. After basking in her victory, she will now be getting back to normal life.\n\"We're going to go back home to Oregon. She's going to go back to her friends, probably go for a long walk in the woods,\" Nyman said.\nNyman added that the rescue is going to launch Wonky Dog, a for-profit LLC of animal philanthropists raising money for rescue dogs."
