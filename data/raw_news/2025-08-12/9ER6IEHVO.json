  "title": "$34.5B Google Chrome Purchase Offer Shocker From AI Startup",
  "description": "Many see Perplexity\u2019s bid to buy Google\u2019s Chrome browser as a strategic statement rather than a likely transaction.",
  "content": "AI-powered search startup Perplexity has made an audacious $34.5 billion offer to buy Google\u2019s Chrome browser, a bid that far exceeds the company\u2019s own $18 billion valuation.\n\nThe unsolicited proposal comes as Google faces mounting pressure from US regulators to loosen its grip on the search market. Last year, a federal judge ruled that Google illegally monopolized online search, and the US Department of Justice (DOJ) has suggested that selling Chrome could help level the playing field.\n\nPerplexity confirmed to The Wall Street Journal that multiple large venture capital funds have agreed to finance the deal in full. The startup said the proposal is \u201cdesigned to satisfy an antitrust remedy in highest public interest by placing Chrome with a capable, independent operator,\u201d per The Journal\u2019s report.\n\nEstimates of Chrome\u2019s market value range between $20 billion and $50 billion, making Perplexity\u2019s $34.5 billion bid a competitive, though still ambitious, offer.\n\nThe offer lands at a delicate time for Google. US District Judge Amit Mehta is reviewing potential remedies after ruling last year that the search giant illegally monopolized the online search market. One option under consideration is forcing Google to divest Chrome.\n\nIn a filing, the DOJ said divesting Chrome would \u201cpermanently stop Google\u2019s control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet.\u201d\n\nChrome is no small asset; the browser has roughly 3.5 billion users and dominates more than 60% of the global market, according to industry estimates. Judge Mehta is expected to announce his decision this month.\n\nBrowsers have become key battlegrounds in the AI era; they not only control access to search traffic but also generate valuable user data for advertising and personalization. Both OpenAI and Yahoo have reportedly expressed interest in Chrome should it hit the market.\n\nGoogle has given no indication it\u2019s willing to sell Chrome. In earlier testimony, Google CEO Sundar Pichai argued that being forced to divest the browser or share data with rivals would \u201charm Google\u2019s business\u201d and pose \u201csecurity risks.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very possible that [Judge Mehta] would hold off on requiring a sale until the appeals process is worked out,\u201d Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, told Reuters.\n\nMany see Perplexity\u2019s bid as a strategic statement rather than a likely transaction, aimed at signaling to the court and the public that a motivated buyer exists if regulators demand a sale. Such a public offer also keeps Perplexity in the spotlight at a time when AI firms are vying for influence, partnerships, and market share.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Perplexity has made a high-profile acquisition attempt. Earlier this year, the startup reportedly explored a merger with TikTok amid concerns over the app\u2019s Chinese ownership.\n\nPerplexity has also been expanding its own products, recently launching an AI-powered browser called Comet. But acquiring Chrome would instantly give it access to billions of users, something that could supercharge its competition with AI rivals like OpenAI.\n\nDuring Google\u2019s antitrust trial, ChatGPT product lead Nick Turley stated OpenAI would be interested in buying Chrome and creating an \u201cAI-first\u201d browsing experience.",

      "text": "UNITED STATES OF AMERICA v. GOOGLE LLC\nNotice (Other) \u2014 Document #1062\nDistrict Court, District of Columbia\nDescription\nNOTICE of Plaintiffs' Initial Proposed Final Judgment by UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (Attachments: # 1 Text of Proposed Order)(Herrmann, Karl) (Entered: 11/20/2024)\nCase 1:20-cv-03010-APM Document 1062 Filed 11/20/24 Page 1 of 23 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, et al., Plaintiffs, Case No. 1:20-cv-03010-APM v. HON. AMIT P. MEHTA GOOGLE LLC, Defendant. STATE OF COLORADO, et al., Plaintiffs, Case No. 1:20-cv-03715-APM v. HON. AMIT P. MEHTA GOOGLE LLC, Defendant. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF PLAINTIFFS\u2019 PROPOSED FINAL JUDGMENT Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM Document 1062 Filed 11/20/24 Page 2 of 23 I. Introduction For more than a decade, Google has unlawfully maintained its monopolies in general search services and search text advertising through a web of anticompetitive practices. As this Court found after a lengthy trial, \u201cGoogle is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly\u201d over both the general search services and search text advertising markets. See Mem. Op., United States et al. v. Google LLC, 20-cv-3010 (APM), ECF No. 1032 (\u201cOp.\u201d), at 4. Google has manipulated its control of Chrome and Android to benefit itself, while sharing monopoly profits under conditions to induce third parties across the ecosystem to help Google maintain its monopolies. Google\u2019s exclusionary conduct has, among other things, made Google the near- universal default for search and ensured that virtually all search access points route users\u2019 valuable queries and interaction data to Google. Google\u2019s unlawful behavior has deprived rivals not only of critical distribution channels but also distribution partners who could otherwise enable entry into these markets by competitors in new and innovative ways. Google\u2019s conduct has resulted in significant anticompetitive effects\u2014causing \u201cmarket foreclosure,\u201d \u201cpreventing rivals from achieving scale,\u201d and \u201cdiminishing the incentives of rivals to invest and innovate.\u201d Op. at 216. The Court\u2019s opinion describes the decade-long harm Google inflicted on the markets for general search and search text advertising and the depths of that harm. At the same time, it also provides a roadmap to the components necessary to restore competition to these markets that have \u201crevolutionized how we live\u201d and how search advertisers reach potential customers. Id. at 1. While following that map requires a comprehensive remedy, making those changes would unleash a significant opportunity for existing competitors and innovative technologies to offer consumers who use general search services and the advertisers who sell to them meaningful choices and competitive rates for the first time in over a decade. Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed remedy is 1 Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM Document 1062 Filed 11/20/24 Page 3 of 23 grounded in longstanding precedent demanding robust remedies for monopolization. Having found a violation of the law, courts are empowered to \u201cprevent future violations and eradicate existing evils.\u201d United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 F.3d 34, 101 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (quoting United States v. Ward Baking Co., 376 U.S. 327, 330\u201331 (1964)). Any remedy requires a \u201ccomprehensive\u201d and \u201cunitary framework\u201d to restore competition with provisions \u201cintended to complement and reinforce each other.\u201d See New York v. Microsoft Corp., 531 F. Supp. 2d 141, 170 (D.D.C. 2008). And a remedy for Google\u2019s unlawful monopolization must simultaneously (1) unfetter these markets from Google\u2019s exclusionary conduct, (2) pry them open to competition, (3) deny Google the fruits of its statutory violations, and (4) prevent Google from monopolizing these and related markets in the future. See Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 103 (quoting Ford Motor Co. v. United States, 405 U.S. 562, 577 (1972) and United States v. United Shoe Mach. Corp., 391 U.S. 244, 250\u201351 (1968)); see also Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Rsch., Inc., 395 U.S. 100, 132\u201333 (1969) (antitrust remedies can extend to related markets); Int\u2019l Boxing Club of N.Y., Inc. v. United States, 358 U.S. 242, 262 (1959) (same). The Proposed Final Judgment serves all of these ends. Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed remedy is also grounded in the market realities of general search services and search text advertising as we find them today. As the Court found, Google\u2019s illegal conduct contributes to a significant (and growing) scale gap that continues to exacerbate the harms found by the Court. Op. at 34. Search engines rely on user data to improve search quality\u2014an outcome that drives more users to a search engine. Id. at 35. Users attract advertisers, and advertising dollars fund general search engines, creating a perpetual feedback loop that further entrenches Google. Id. at 230\u201331. Thus, Google\u2019s exclusionary conduct has ensured not only that rivals are denied distribution but also that rivals are unlawfully 2 Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM Document 1062 Filed 11/20/24 Page 4 of 23 disadvantaged with respect to quality. Id. The playing field is not level because of Google\u2019s conduct, and Google\u2019s quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired. The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages. Restoring competition to the markets for general search and search text advertising as they exist today will require reactivating the competitive process that Google has long stifled: The remedy must enable and encourage the development of an unfettered search ecosystem that induces entry, competition, and innovation as rivals vie to win the business of consumers and advertisers. To reach this goal, the remedy must address each of the ingredients necessary to create opportunities for competition to emerge. The promise of new technologies, including advances in artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d), may present an opportunity for fresh competition. But only a comprehensive set of remedies can thaw the ecosystem and finally reverse years of anticompetitive effects. A successful remedy requires that Google: stop third-party payments that exclude rivals by advantaging Google and discouraging procompetitive partnerships that would offer entrants access to efficient and effective distribution; disclose data sufficient to level the scale-based playing field it has illegally slanted, including, at the outset, licensing syndicated search results that provide potential competitors a chance to offer greater innovation and more effective competition; and reduce Google\u2019s ability to control incentives across the broader ecosystem via ownership and control of products and data complementary to search. Google\u2019s ownership and control of Chrome and Android\u2014key methods for the distribution of search engines to consumers\u2014poses a significant challenge to effectuate a remedy that aims to \u201cunfetter [these] market[s] from anticompetitive conduct\u201d and \u201censure that there remain no practices likely to result in monopolization in the future.\u201d Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 103. To address these challenges, Google must divest Chrome, which has \u201cfortified [Google\u2019s] 3 Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM Document 1062 Filed 11/20/24 Page 5 of 23 dominance,\u201d Op. at 33, so that rivals may pursue distribution partnerships that this \u201crealit[y] of control,\u201d id. at 159 (citations omitted), today prevents. As to Android\u2014a critical platform on which search competitors rely and for which Google has myriad obvious and not-so-obvious ways to favor its own search products\u2014there are two options: one that swiftly, efficiently, and decisively strikes at the locus of some anticompetitive conduct at issue here, and a second option that invites Court and Plaintiff oversight into longer-term behavioral remedies that may be more protracted and less certain due to Google\u2019s conduct. The most straightforward solution\u2014the first option\u2014would be to divest Android, which would prevent Google from using Android to exclude rival search providers. But Plaintiffs recognize that such divestiture may draw significant objections from Google or other market participants. As an alternative to the divestiture of Android, Plaintiffs have presented behavioral remedies that would blunt Google\u2019s ability to use its control of the Android ecosystem to favor its general search services and search text ad monopolies as well as limit Google\u2019s ability to discriminate in favor of its own search and ads businesses. This alternative option would require vigilance and oversight by the Court and Plaintiffs; if such efforts ultimately fail to achieve the high standards for meaningful relief in these critical markets, the Court could require return to the first option. Google is further prohibited from owning or acquiring any interests in search rivals, potential entrants, and rival search or search ads-related AI products, and it must immediately divest any such interests it owns. Plaintiffs\u2019 remedy proposal also ensures efficacy, efficiency, and administrability by deploying a Technical Committee to investigate and examine the issues that will invariably arise relating to Google\u2019s implementation of the remedies, similar to the approach approved by the D.C. Circuit in United States v. Microsoft. See Massachusetts v. Microsoft Corp., 373 F.3d 1199, 4 Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM Document 1062 Filed 11/20/24 Page 6 of 23 1243\u201344 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (\u201c[T]he Government\u2019s ability to enforce the decree is clearly strengthened, not diminished, by the existence and composition of the Technical Committee\u201d). Plaintiffs\u2019 proposal also provides a streamlined path for the regular evaluation and modification often required of monopolization remedies, including the eventual divestiture of Android if Google chooses to retain ownership but persists in exploiting its control to the detriment of competition. United Shoe, 391 U.S. at 250\u201351. Moreover, the remedy must restore incentives for innovation and disruptive entry that Google\u2019s conduct has\u2014for over a decade\u2014diminished. For example, in recent years \u201c[t]he integration of generative AI is perhaps the clearest example of competition advancing search quality.\u201d Op. at 41. AI has the ability to affect market dynamics in these industries today as well as tomorrow. The remedy must prevent Google from frustrating or circumventing the Court\u2019s Final Judgment by manipulating the development and deployment of new technologies like query-based AI solutions that provide the most likely long-term path for a new generation of search competitors, who will depend on the absence of anticompetitive constraints to evolve into full-fledged competitors and competitive threats. II. The Proposed Final Judgment Guided by governing case law, and with these market realities and dynamics in mind, Plaintiffs respectfully submit the Initial Proposed Final Judgment (\u201cPFJ\u201d), which provides the Court with a comprehensive and unitary remedy to address the harms in the general search services and search text advertising markets, ensure that Google cannot further cement its monopolies by engaging in anticompetitive conduct, and prevent Google from circumventing the Court\u2019s judgment. To that end, Plaintiffs propose a variety of interconnected and self-reinforcing remedies to: (1) stop and prevent exclusionary agreements with third parties; (2) prevent Google from self-preferencing through its ownership and control of search-related products; (3) prevent 5 Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM Document 1062 Filed 11/20/24 Page 7 of 23 Google from stifling or eliminating emerging competitive threats through acquisitions, minority investments, or partnerships; (4) disclose data critical to restoring competition; (5) increase transparency and control for advertisers; (6) end Google\u2019s unlawful distribution; and (7) allow for the enforcement of the PFJ while preventing circumvention. Those remedies are summarized below for the Court\u2019s convenience. Further, and to correct for the fact that Google\u2019s unchecked monopolies have frozen the general search ecosystem for more than a decade, Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed remedies run for a period of 10 years, with some exceptions as detailed below and in the PFJ. A. Stopping and Preventing Exclusionary Agreements with Third Parties An effective remedy must prevent Google from entering into contracts that foreclose or otherwise exclude competing general search engines and potential entrants, including by raising their costs, discouraging their distribution, or depriving them of competitive access to inputs. As detailed in Section IV, the PFJ prohibits Google from providing third parties something of value (including financial payments) in order to make Google the default general search engine or otherwise discouraging those third parties from offering competing search products. See Op. at 216 (finding \u201cGoogle\u2019s distribution agreements are exclusionary contracts that violate Section 2\u201d and \u201cclearly have a significant effect in preserving [Google\u2019s] monopoly.\u201d) (citations omitted). The PFJ also prohibits Google from entering exclusive agreements with content publishers; bundling, tying, or comingling its general search engine or search access points with any other Google product; entering revenue share agreements related to the distribution of general search services; or participating in investments in, collaborations with, or acquisitions of its competitors or potential competitors in the general search services or search text ads markets without prior approval of the United States. The proposed remedies are designed to end Google\u2019s unlawful practices and open up the market for rivals and new entrants to emerge. 6 Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM Document 1062 Filed 11/20/24 Page 8 of 23 B. Prohibited Ownership And Control That Enables Self-Preferencing In order to safeguard against the possibility of further foreclosure and exclusion of rivals and potential entrants including via self-preferencing, the PFJ requires Google to divest Chrome. As the Court recognized, \u201cGoogle\u2019s near-complete control of the most efficient search distribution channels is a major barrier to entry,\u201d and the Chrome default is \u201ca market reality that significantly narrows the available channels of distribution and thus disincentivizes the emergence of new competition.\u201d Op. at 159. Plaintiffs\u2019 PFJ addresses this \u201crealit[y] of control,\u201d id., and will restore incentives to rivals and potential entrants to compete. Plaintiffs\u2019 PFJ further provides that Google is prohibited from owning not only a browser\u2014following its divestiture of Chrome it may not reenter the browser market for five years\u2014but also from owning or acquiring any investment or interest in any search or search text ad rival, search distributor, or rival query-based AI product or ads technology. Google\u2019s financial entanglements with current or future rivals risk compromising the proposed remedy. Investments in or acquisitions of potential rivals would stifle emerging competition or reduce their incentives to challenge Google. Such arrangements frustrate the PFJ\u2019s remedial goals of fostering innovation and transforming the general search and search text ads markets over the next decade. Google must disclose any such investments it owns, immediately refrain from using these interests to discourage or disincentivize competing products, and must divest these holdings within six months. Plaintiffs\u2019 PFJ also provides for further contingent structural relief\u2014the divestiture of Android\u2014if Plaintiffs\u2019 proposed conduct remedies are not effective in preventing Google from improperly leveraging its control of the Android ecosystem to its advantage, or if Google 7 Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM Document 1062 Filed 11/20/24 Page 9 of 23 attempts to circumvent the remedy package. See, e.g., United Shoe, 391 U.S. at 249\u201351.1 Similar to United Shoe, Plaintiffs propose with respect to Android \u201cthat relatively mild remedies should be tried as a first resort, and that the possibility of more drastic measures should be held in abeyance.\u201d Id. at 249. Indeed, in United Shoe, when the initially imposed behavioral remedies failed to establish the decree\u2019s goal of \u201cworkable competition,\u201d the Supreme Court ordered the district court to consider the government\u2019s subsequent request to break the defendant into \u201ctwo fully competing companies.\u201d Id. at 247, 251\u201352 (\u201cthe time has come to prescribe other, and if necessary more definitive, means to achieve the result\u201d). Alternatively, Google may also choose to divest Android at the outset in lieu of adhering to the requirements of Section V as they relate to Android. C. Conduct Remedies That Prevent Self-Preferencing An effective remedy must also ensure that Google cannot circumvent the Court\u2019s remedy by providing its search products preferential access to related products or services that it owns or controls, including mobile operating systems (e.g., Android), apps (e.g., YouTube), or AI products (e.g. Gemini) or related data. As noted in Section V, the PFJ prohibits, among other things, Google from using any owned or operated asset to preference its general search engine or search text ad products. The PFJ further prohibits Google from engaging in conduct that undermines, frustrates, interferes with, or in any way lessens the ability of a user to discover a rival general search engine, limits the competitive capabilities of rivals, or otherwise impedes user discovery of products or services that are competitive threats to Google in the general search services or search text ads markets. Op. at 119\u201321, 210 (finding that Google\u2019s contractual 1 As the Court in Microsoft recognized, \u201cconduct remedies may be unavailing\u201d in cases such as this, where \u201cyears have passed since [Google] engaged in the first conduct.\u201d Microsoft, 253 F.3d at 49. 8 Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM Document 1062 Filed 11/20/24 Page 10 of 23 requirements that Chrome be preinstalled and the Google Search widget be placed on the home screen of all Android devices was an unlawful exclusive agreement). D. Restoring Competition Through Syndication And Data Access Data at scale is the \u201cessential raw material\u201d for \u201cbuilding, improving and sustaining\u201d a competitive general search engine. Op. at 226 (finding that \u201cGoogle\u2019s exclusive agreements\u2026deny rivals access to use queries, or scale, needed to effectively compete.\u201d). Through its unlawful behavior, Google has accumulated a staggering amount of data over many years, at the expense of its rivals. Id. Plaintiffs\u2019 PFJ aims to remedy this anticompetitively acquired advantage. As set forth in Section VI, the PFJ requires Google, among other things, to make its search index available at marginal cost, and on an ongoing basis, to rivals and potential rivals; and also requires Google to provide rivals and potential rivals both user-side and ads data for a period of ten years, at no cost, on a non-discriminatory basis, and with proper privacy safeguards in place. Section VI further requires that Google provide publishers, websites, and content creators with data crawling rights (such as the ability to opt out of having their content crawled for the index or training of large language models or displayed as AI-generated content). To remove barriers to entry and erode Google\u2019s unlawfully gained scale advantages, Section VII requires Google to syndicate (subject to certain restrictions) its search results, ranking signals, and query understanding information for ten years. The PFJ only requires Google to syndicate queries that originate in the United States. Section VII also requires Google to syndicate its search text ads for terms of one year subject to certain restrictions. E. Restoring Competition By Improving Transparency And Reduction Of Switching Costs Google\u2019s unlawful maintenance of its search text advertising monopoly has undermined advertisers\u2019 choice of search providers, as well as rivals\u2019 ability to monetize search advertising, 9 Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM Document 1062 Filed 11/20/24 Page 11 of 23 and has enabled \u201cGoogle to profitably charge supracompetitive prices for search text advertisements\u201d while \u201cdegrad[ing] the quality of its text advertisements\u201d and the related services and reporting. Op. at 258\u201365 (finding \u201cGoogle\u2019s text ads products has degraded\u201d and \u201cadvertisers receive less information in search query reports.\u201d). As set forth in Section VIII, Plaintiffs\u2019 PFJ will remedy these harms by providing advertisers with the information, options, and visibility into the performance and cost of Google Text Ads necessary to optimize their advertising across Google and its rivals. In particular, the PFJ requires Google to include fulsome and necessary real-time performance information about ad performance and costs in its search query reports to advertisers, and further requires Google to increase advertiser control by improving keyword matching options to advertisers. Op. at 263\u201364 (finding Google degraded SQR content and reduced control over keyword matching). The PFJ also prohibits Google from limiting the ability of advertisers to export search text ad data and information for which the advertiser bids on keywords, and further requires that Google provide to the Technical Committee and Plaintiffs a monthly report outlining any changes to its search text ads auction and its public disclosure of those changes. F. Limitations On Distribution And User Notifications To Restore Competition A comprehensive and unitary remedy in this case must also undo the effects on search distribution. See Op. at 3 (\u201c[M]ost devices in the United States come preloaded exclusively with Google. These distribution deals have forced Google\u2019s rivals to find other ways to reach users.\u201d). To remedy these harms, the PFJ requires Google to divest Chrome, which will permanently stop Google\u2019s control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet. In addition, the PFJ contains multiple provisions that will limit Google\u2019s distribution of general search services by contract with third-party devices and search access points (e.g., Samsung 10 Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM Document 1062 Filed 11/20/24 Page 12 of 23 devices, Safari, Firefox) and via self-distribution on Google devices and search access points (e.g., Pixel) which will facilitate competition in the markets for general search services and search text advertising. These provisions are designed to end Google\u2019s unlawful distribution agreements, ensure that Google cannot approximate its unlawful practices with updated contracts, and eliminate anticompetitive payments to distributors, including Apple. As set forth in Section IV, the PFJ prohibits Google from offering Apple anything of value for any form of default, placement, or preinstallation distribution (including choice screens) related to general search or a search access point. See Op. at 238, 240\u201344 (\u201cApple, a fierce potential competitor, remains on the sidelines due to the large revenue share payments it receives from Google\u201d). As set forth in Section IX, for non-Apple distributors and third-party devices, the PFJ similarly prohibits\u2014with limited exceptions\u2014Google from offering anything of value for any form of default, placement, or preinstallation distribution (including choice screens) related to general search or a search access point. The PFJ further prohibits Google from preinstalling any search access point on any new Google device, and requires it to display a choice screen on every new and existing instance of a Google browser where the user has not previously affirmatively selected a default general search engine. The choice screens must be designed not to preference Google and to be accessible, easy to use, and minimize choice friction, based on empirical evidence of consumer behavior, among other requirements. User choice will be improved when consumers better understand the benefits that Google\u2019s rivals can provide. For that reason, Colorado Plaintiff States have included a provision requiring Google to fund a nationwide advertising and education program. The fund\u2019s purpose is to enhance the effectiveness of distribution remedies by informing users of the outcome of this 11 Case 1:20-cv-03010-APM Document 1062 Filed 11/20/24 Page 13 of 23 litigation and the remedies in the Final Judgment designed to increase user choice. The program may include short-term incentive payments to individual users as a further incentive to choosing a non-Google default on a choice screen. G. Administration, Anti-circumvention, and Anti-retaliation A remedy that prevents and restrains monopoly maintenance will require administration as well as protections against circumvention and retaliation, including through novel paths to preserving dominance in the monopolized markets. This is especially important in the types of markets implicated here. As set forth in Section X, Plaintiffs\u2019 PFJ requires Google to appoint an internal Compliance Officer and establishes a Technical Committee to assist Plaintiffs and the Court in monitoring Google\u2019s compliance. See United States v. Microsoft Corp., Civ. No. 98- 1232 (CKK), 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22864, at *22 (D.D.C. Nov. 12, 2002) (establishing a Technical Committee \u201cto assist in enforcement of and compliance with this Final Judgment.\u201d). This section of the PFJ provides Plaintiffs tools to investigate complaints about Google\u2019s compliance and prohibits Google from taking retaliatory or circumventing actions. \u2055 \u2055 \u2055 Plaintiffs\u2019 PFJ reflects extensive efforts to engage with market participants, utilize formal discovery, and collaborate with experts. Given that third-party outreach and discovery on Google are ongoing, Plaintiffs will continue to investigate and evaluate the remedies necessary to restore competition to the affected markets. Plaintiffs reserve the right to add, remove, or modify provisions of the PFJ as needed following further engagement with market participants and additional remedies discovery. Consistent with the Court\u2019s scheduling order governing remedy proceedings, Plaintiffs will file a Revised PFJ on March 7, 2025.

This move comes amid ongoing antitrust scrutiny of Google, with regulators suggesting that divesting Chrome could enhance competition in the search market. Perplexity's offer is seen as a strategic statement to demonstrate a viable buyer exists if regulators mandate a sale, while Google has not indicated any willingness to sell.",
