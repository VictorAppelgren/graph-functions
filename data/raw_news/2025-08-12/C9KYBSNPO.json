  "title": "Norway Oil Fund Grows in First Half on Equity-Market Strength \u2014 Update",
  "description": "",
  "content": "Norway's sovereign-wealth fund returned 5.7% in the first half, driven by strong equity markets.\n\nNorges Bank Investment Management--the arm of the central bank that manages the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, commonly known as the oil fund--said Tuesday that the fund had a market value of 19.586 trillion kroner ($1.914 trillion) as of June 30.\n\n\"The result is driven by good returns in the stock market, particularly in the financial sector,\" said Norges Bank Investment Management Chief Executive Nicolai Tangen.\n\nEuropean banks made the greatest contribution, driven by expectations of increased public expenditure and further healthy profitability.\n\nAside from financials, telecoms and utilities were the strongest sectors, while healthcare produced the weakest return in the period, it said.\n\nThe telecoms sector benefited from stable revenue streams, expectations of consolidation in Europe, and new sources of revenue in artificial intelligence, while utilities were boosted partly by investors seeking more stable investments in a period of falling oil and gas prices, it said.\n\nWithin the healthcare sector, stocks in healthcare providers in particular lost value amid uncertainty around changes to U.S. healthcare policy, it added.\n\nThe Norwegian krone appreciated against several major currencies during the first half, with currency movements contributing to a 1.01 trillion kroner hit to the fund's value, it said.\n\nThe fund was 70.6% invested in equities, 27.1% in fixed income, 1.9% in unlisted real estate and 0.4% in unlisted renewable-energy infrastructure.\n\nEquity investments returned 6.7% in the half, while fixed-income investments returned 3.3%, unlisted real-estate investments returned 4% and unlisted renewable energy infrastructure returned of 9.4%.\n\nThe results come after the fund said late Monday that it sold its stakes in several Israeli companies and ended ties with Israeli fund managers following complaints that some of its investments might be contributing to Israel's military action in Gaza.\n\nNorway's ministry of finance last week wrote to the country's central bank and the oil fund's ethics council to review the Israeli investments and provide an assessment of any measures that are deemed necessary by next week.\n\nThe fund said it has since decided to focus on its investments in Israeli companies that form part of its benchmark index. It was invested in 61 Israeli companies at the end of the first half, but has spent the last few days selling 11 that weren't part of the index.\n\nTangen said in a statement that the situation in Gaza is a serious humanitarian crisis and the fund will now further strengthen its due diligence.\n\n\"These measures were taken in response to extraordinary circumstances,\" he said. \"The measures we are taking will simplify the management of our investments in this market and reduce the number of companies that we and the council on ethics monitor.\"\n\nThe wealth fund is managed by Norway's central bank, but decisions to exclude companies from the portfolio are made based on recommendations from an ethics council appointed by the ministry of finance. The council's job is to scrutinize investments to ensure they comply with a strict set of ethical guidelines.",
