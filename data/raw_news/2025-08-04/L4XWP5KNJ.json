  "title": "Z.ai Launches GLM-4.5: China's Most Advanced Open-Source AI Model",
  "description": "Z.ai's GLM-4.5 introduces China's first open-source Mixture of Experts model, offering fast, cost-efficient, agent-native AI performance for global developers.",
  "content": "New York, July 29, 2025 \u2014 Chinese AI company Z.ai has released GLM-4.5, its latest open-source base model that sets a new performance benchmark for open foundation models. Built on a fully self-developed architecture, GLM-4.5 is China's first open-source Mixture of Experts (MoE) model and aims to deliver high performance while reducing deployment costs for developers.\n\nThe GLM-4.5 lineup includes two versions: The 355B-parameter flagship and the lighter GLM-4.5-Air at 106B parameters. Both integrate native reasoning, coding, and agentic capabilities and were evaluated across 12 benchmark tests. GLM-4.5 ranked third globally overall and first among open-source and Chinese-developed models.\n\nDesigned with efficiency in mind, GLM-4.5-Air leads its class in the 100B-parameter range. The models also offer fast generation speeds (100+ tokens/sec) and competitive pricing at $0.11/million input tokens and $0.28/million output tokens.\n\nWhat sets GLM-4.5 apart is its architecture. Agentic functions like multi-step planning, visualisation, and workflow management are embedded directly into the model's core, offering unified reasoning, perception, and action within a single framework.\n\nIn contrast to closed models, GLM-4.5 is released under an open, auditable licence, with on-premise deployment and fine-tuning options\u2014providing more transparency and control for enterprises.\n\nZ.ai has been recognised by OpenAI as one of the few global companies building competitive AI models. It was also listed in Stanford's 2025 AI Index as a developer of and is the first Chinese firm to sign the Frontier AI Safety Commitments.\n\nSince 2020, Z.ai's open-source models have exceeded 40 million downloads. The company's portfolio includes the GLM series, AutoGLM agent models, small-footprint Flash models, and a growing suite of developer tools and APIs.\n\nFounded in 2019, Z.ai (formerly Zhipu) is a leading Chinese AI company focused on developing next-generation cognitive models. Since launching the GLM pre-training framework in 2020, Z.ai has released several industry-leading models, including GLM-130B and ChatGLM, with over 40 million global downloads. Its product suite includes Z.ai, QingYan, CodeGeeX, CogVLM, and CogView, as well as an innovative Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) platform for developers and enterprises. Recognised with numerous industry awards, Z.ai is driving progress towards the era of artificial general intelligence.",
