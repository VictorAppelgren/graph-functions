  "content": "Dario Amodei, Anthropic CEO, speaking on CNBC's Squawk Box outside the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Jan. 21st, 2025.\n\nAnthropic on Tuesday announced it has closed a $13 billion funding round at a $183 billion post-money valuation, roughly triple what the artificial intelligence startup was worth as of its last raise in March.\n\nThe most recent funding round was led by Iconiq, Fidelity Management & Research Company and Lightspeed Venture Partners. Other investors including Altimeter, General Catalyst and Coatue also participated, Anthropic said.\n\n\"This financing demonstrates investors' extraordinary confidence in our financial performance and the strength of their collaboration with us to continue fueling our unprecedented growth,\" Anthropic finance chief Krishna Rao said in a statement.\n\nAnthropic's valuation has been on a steep climb since it announced its AI assistant Claude in March 2023. The Amazon -backed startup was founded by former OpenAI research executives, including its CEO Dario Amodei.\n\nOpenAI and Anthropic are fierce competitors in the AI market. OpenAI, which rocketed into the mainstream following the release of its AI chatbot ChatGPT in 2022, is preparing to sell stock as part of a secondary sale that would value the company at roughly $500 billion, as CNBC reported in August.\n\nAs of August, Anthropic said its run-rate revenue has reached over $5 billion, up from roughly $1 billion at the beginning of the year. Anthropic serves more than 300,000 business customers, the company said.\n\nAnthropic said it will use its fresh capital to deepen safety research, meet growing enterprise demand and support international expansion.\n\nWATCH: As Anthropic goes, so goes the generative AI trade, says Big Technology\u2019s Alex Kantrowitz",

      "text": "Anthropic raises $13B Series F at $183B post-money valuation\nAnthropic has completed a Series F fundraising of $13 billion led by ICONIQ. This financing values Anthropic at $183 billion post-money. Along with ICONIQ, the round was co-led by Fidelity Management & Research Company and Lightspeed Venture Partners. The investment reflects Anthropic\u2019s continued momentum and reinforces our position as the leading intelligence platform for enterprises, developers, and power users.\nSignificant investors in this round include Altimeter, Baillie Gifford, affiliated funds of BlackRock, Blackstone, Coatue, D1 Capital Partners, General Atlantic, General Catalyst, GIC, Growth Equity at Goldman Sachs Alternatives, Insight Partners, Jane Street, Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, Qatar Investment Authority, TPG, T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., T. Rowe Price Investment Management, Inc., WCM Investment Management, and XN.\n\u201cFrom Fortune 500 companies to AI-native startups, our customers rely on Anthropic\u2019s frontier models and platform products for their most important, mission-critical work,\u201d said Krishna Rao, Chief Financial Officer of Anthropic. \u201cWe are seeing exponential growth in demand across our entire customer base. This financing demonstrates investors\u2019 extraordinary confidence in our financial performance and the strength of their collaboration with us to continue fueling our unprecedented growth.\u201d\nAnthropic has seen rapid growth since the launch of Claude in March 2023. At the beginning of 2025, less than two years after launch, Anthropic\u2019s run-rate revenue had grown to approximately $1 billion. By August 2025, just eight months later, our run-rate revenue reached over $5 billion\u2014making Anthropic one of the fastest-growing technology companies in history.\nAnthropic\u2019s trajectory has been driven by our leading technical talent, our focus on safety, and our frontier research, including pioneering alignment and interpretability work, all of which underpin the performance and reliability of our models. Every day more businesses, developers, and consumer power users are trusting Claude to help them solve their most challenging problems. Anthropic now serves over 300,000 business customers, and our number of large accounts\u2014customers that each represent over $100,000 in run-rate revenue\u2014has grown nearly 7x in the past year.\nThis growth spans the entire Anthropic platform, with advancements for businesses, developers, and consumers. For businesses, our API and industry-specific products make it easy to add powerful AI to their critical applications without complex integration work. Developers have made Claude Code their tool of choice since its full launch in May 2025. Claude Code has quickly taken off\u2014already generating over $500 million in run-rate revenue with usage growing more than 10x in just three months. For individual users, the Pro and Max plans for Claude deliver enhanced AI capabilities for everyday tasks and specialized projects.\n\u201cAnthropic is on an exceptional trajectory, combining research excellence, technological leadership, and relentless focus on customers. We\u2019re honored to partner with Dario and the team, and our lead investment in their Series F reflects our belief in their values and their ability to shape the future of responsible AI,\u201d said Divesh Makan, Partner at ICONIQ. \u201cEnterprise leaders tell us what we\u2019re seeing firsthand\u2014Claude is reliable, built on a trustworthy foundation, and guided by leaders truly focused on the long term.\u201d\nThe Series F investment will expand our capacity to meet growing enterprise demand, deepen our safety research, and support international expansion as we continue building reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems."

The talks are still in early stages and the details could change.\nBloomberg was first to report the discussions. All three firms are existing investors in OpenAI, but Thrive Capital could lead the round, as CNBC previously reported. SoftBank, Dragoneer and Thrive Capital did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.\nOpenAI's valuation has grown exponentially since the artificial intelligence startup launched its generative AI chatbot ChatGPT in late 2022.\nThe company announced a $40 billion funding round in March at a $300 billion, by far the largest amount ever raised by a private tech company. Earlier this month, OpenAI announced its most recent $8.3 billion in fresh capital tied to that funding round.\nLast week, OpenAI announced GPT-5, its latest and most advanced large-scale AI model. OpenAI said the model is smarter, faster and \"a lot more useful,\" particularly across domains like writing, coding and health care. But it's been a rocky roll out, as some users complained about losing access to OpenAI's prior models.\n\"We for sure underestimated how much some of the things that people like in GPT-4o matter to them, even if GPT-5 performs better in most ways,\" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman wrote in a post on X.\nWATCH: OpenAI staffer reportedly to sell $6 billion in stock to SoftBank and other investors"

      "text": "OpenAI is close to releasing an AI-powered web browser that will challenge Alphabet's market-dominating Google Chrome, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.\nThe browser is slated to launch in the coming weeks, three of the people said, and aims to use artificial intelligence to fundamentally change how consumers browse the web. It will give OpenAI more direct access to a cornerstone of Google's success: user data.\nIf adopted by the 400 million weekly active users of ChatGPT, OpenAI's browser could put pressure on a key component of rival Google's ad-money spigot. Chrome is an important pillar of Alphabet's ad business, which makes up nearly three-quarters of its revenue, as Chrome provides user information to help Alphabet target ads more effectively and profitably, and also gives Google a way to route search traffic to its own engine by default.\nOpenAI's browser is designed to keep some user interactions within a ChatGPT-like native chat interface instead of clicking through to websites, two of the sources said.\nThe browser is part of a broader strategy by OpenAI to weave its services across the personal and work lives of consumers, one of the sources said.\nOpenAI declined to comment.\nThe sources declined to be identified because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\nLed by entrepreneur Sam Altman, OpenAI upended the tech industry with the launch of its AI chatbot ChatGPT in late 2022. After its initial success, OpenAI has faced stiff competition from rivals including Google and startup Anthropic, and is looking for new areas of growth.\nIn May, OpenAI said it would enter the hardware domain, paying $6.5 billion to buy io, an AI devices startup from Apple's former design chief, Jony Ive.\nA web browser would allow OpenAI to directly integrate its AI agent products such as Operator into the browsing experience, enabling the browser to carry out tasks on behalf of the user, the people said.\nThe browser's access to a user's web activity would make it the ideal platform for AI \"agents\" that can take actions on their behalf, like booking reservations or filling out forms, directly within the websites they use.\nTough competition\nOpenAI has its work cut out - Google Chrome, which is used by more than 3 billion people, currently holds more than two-thirds of the worldwide browser market, according to web analytics firm StatCounter. Apple's second-place Safari lags far behind with a 16% share. Last month, OpenAI said it had 3 million paying business users for ChatGPT.\nOther AI startups like The Browser Company and Brave have announced AI-powered browsers capable of performing actions on a user's behalf this year. Perplexity, a well-funded startup known for its search engine, also launched its AI browser, Comet, on Wednesday.\nChrome's role in providing user information to help Alphabet target ads more effectively and profitably has proven so successful that the Department of Justice has demanded its divestiture after a U.S. judge last year ruled that the Google parent holds an unlawful monopoly in online search.\nOpenAI's browser is built atop Chromium, Google's own open-source browser code, two of the sources said. Chromium is the source code for Google Chrome, as well as many competing browsers including Microsoft's Edge and Opera.\nLast year, OpenAI hired two longtime Google vice presidents who were part of the original team that developed Google Chrome. The Information was first to report their hires and that OpenAI previously considered building a browser.\nAn OpenAI executive testified in April that the company would be interested in buying Chrome if antitrust enforcers succeeded in forcing the sale.\nGoogle has not offered Chrome for sale. The company has said it plans to appeal the ruling that it holds a monopoly.\nOpenAI decided to build its own browser, rather than simply a \"plug-in\" on top of another company's browser, in order to have more control over the data it can collect, one source said."

Lightspeed Venture Partners is leading the funding, with participation from General Catalyst and others, the sources said.\nThe financing, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, signals continued investor demand for top-tier AI companies, even in the face of potential disruption from China's DeepSeek. Anthropic is backed by Amazon and Google, and had initially set out to raise $2 billion, according to a source.\nAnthropic declined to comment.\nThe company's last private market valuation was $18 billion. Amazon has poured $8 billion into the startup.\nAnthropic was founded by early OpenAI employees and is the creator of the popular chatbot Claude. Earlier Monday, Anthropic released what it says is its \"most intelligent AI model yet.\" Its so-called hybrid model combines an ability to reason \u2014 or stopping to think about complex answers \u2014 with a traditional model that spits out answers in real time."
