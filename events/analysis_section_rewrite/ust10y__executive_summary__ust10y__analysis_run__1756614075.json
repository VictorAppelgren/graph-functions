A 50–100 bp rise in copper futures from the tariff‑induced supply shock could lift inflation expectations and push the 10‑year above 4.3 % (F7K7Y35U5), whereas a Treasury rollback in early 2026 could flatten copper by 2–4 % and pull the 10‑year back toward 4.0 % (F7K7Y35U5).”  \n5. **Keep** sentence 9 (Fed’s 25‑bp cut expected to steepen the 10‑year but term‑premium compression may keep it near 4.23 % unless a stronger stimulus follows, citations B1KYJ1GPU, XTQIQRP5K, NIT6JFIQF, FAN5RYW6T).  \n6. **Condense** sentence 10 into risk bullet: “Risks: unexpected Fed hikes, inflation resurgence lifting the 10‑year above 4.3 %, or debt‑pressure‑driven term‑premium widening (LF0UUL917).”  \n7. **Condense** sentence 11 into watch‑list: “Watch signals: Fed Sept 16‑17 meeting, core PCE, tariff announcements, 2‑yr/10‑yr spread; a sharp move will invalidate the 1–2 % term‑premium projection (97MD1FHW8, LF0UUL917).”  \n8. **Omit** sentence 13 (confidence discussion) to stay within 5‑sentence limit and avoid filler.  \n\nResulting brief (5 sentences, all with citations, explicit magnitude ranges, and a clear catalyst window).",
