      "title": "TD Cowen Upgrade and Delivery Restructuring Could Be a Game Changer for EPAM Systems (EPAM)",
      "summary": "TD Cowen upgraded EPAM Systems to ‘Buy’ after three quarters of organic revenue acceleration and the completion of its post‑Ukraine restructuring, highlighting the company’s growing AI‑driven services and improved sales execution. EPAM is projected to reach $6.5 billion in revenue and $582 million in earnings by 2028, with a consensus fair value of $212.69—about 20% above its current price—though margin recovery remains vulnerable to wage inflation and talent competition. The narrative underscores both the upside from AI and platform expansion and the structural risks of shifting demand toward low‑code solutions, geopolitical exposure, and intense competition from larger cloud providers. The article also lists 193 other companies identified as having promising cash‑flow potential yet trading below their fair value, offering a broader value‑investment context. ",
