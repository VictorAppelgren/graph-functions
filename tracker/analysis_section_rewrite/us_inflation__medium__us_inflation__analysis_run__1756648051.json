      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**\n\n1. **Remove unsupported macro‑terms** – The draft references “term premium” and “fiscal drag” without any source. Delete those phrases or replace them with evidence‑based language (e.g., “defense bill increases fiscal outlays” citing O6LHRBLFM).  \n2. **Add citations to every claim** –  \n   - “10‑year yield will rise 20–30 bp” → add a quantitative estimate from a credible source (e.g., a Fed projection or Treasury analysis; if none, remove the specific magnitude).  \n   - “Fed officials signaled earlier rate cuts” → keep GK86UUQPN.  \n   - “Defense bill earmarks >$150 B for AI/missile defense” → keep O6LHRBLFM.  \n   - “Labor market stall speed could lift unemployment to 6 %” → keep GK86UUQPN.  \n   - “Fed may hold or raise rates if inflation remains elevated” → keep GK86UUQPN.  \n3. **Condense the narrative** – Keep only the core causal chain: defense bill → fiscal outlay → potential 10‑year lift; Fed dovish stance → short‑term rate cut → net 10‑year effect. Remove any extra speculation (“fiscal drag keeps curve upward”).  \n4. **Clarify catalyst windows** – Explicitly state dates:  \n   - Defense bill passage: expected Q4 2025 (August–September).  \n   - Fed policy minutes: July 2025 and August 2025.  \n   - Labor market revisions: August 2025 (jobs report) and September 2025 (BLS revision).  \n5. **Rephrase alternative scenario** – Instead of “if the Fed holds or raises rates, the 10‑year could fall 10–20 bp,” say “Fed tightening or persistent inflation could compress the term structure, pushing the 10‑year down 10–20 bp” and cite GK86UUQPN.  \n6. **Risk & watch list** – Keep the three risks but add inline citations:  \n   - “Defense bill may not pass in full” → O6LHRBLFM.  \n   - “Fed may hold/raise rates” → GK86UUQPN.  \n   - “Sharper labor slowdown triggers recession and rapid Fed easing” → GK86UUQPN.  \n   Watch signals: Fed minutes (GK86UUQPN), defense bill status (O6LHRBLFM), labor revisions (GK86UUQPN).  \n7. **Confidence statement** – Keep “moderate confidence” but back it with the fact that the defense bill and Fed signals are the primary drivers.  \n8. **Ensure asset focus** – All statements must reference the 10‑year U.S. Treasury (ust10y) with explicit sign/magnitude. Remove any mention of other assets or unrelated topics.  \n\nImplement these edits to produce a concise, evidence‑anchored 3–6‑month outlook for ust10y.",
