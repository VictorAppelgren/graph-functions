      "feedback": "The draft shows ambition and pulls hard numbers from the sources, but it currently fails the SECTION FOCUS on format, causal discipline, and evidence density. Actionable edits: (1) reformat to exactly four Movers lines (2 Up, 2 Down) with the required fields and citations only on facts/numbers; choose Up 0–3 weeks, Up 3–6 months, Down 0–3 weeks, Down 3–6 months and ground each line in a tight causal hook (e.g., Intel stake terms as a driver for risk-on; Regime A durability from MSFT/SHOP data; regulatory headwinds; Regime shift to Regime B/C); anchor each fact to IDs (e.g., XQWTVR71K; 0G3A676BP; QFDWCTAYB; IGP1Q4ZEJ) and pair with a single, explicit “What to watch” item and a probability (e.g., 60%, 55%, 40%, 35%); (2) for the Trade/Outlook, since Intel is tradable, present a Swing Trade line with precise fields: Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence %; use concrete triggers (final stake terms, vesting timetable, passive vs voting rights) and assign numbers anchored to sources (e.g., Entry on disclosure, Stop if terms non-passive, Target 8–12%, R/R ~1.5x, Trigger official terms disclosure, Probability 60%, Confidence 70) and cite the stake details (XQWTVR71K) where used. (3) strengthen the first-principles spine by opening with a succinct 1–2 sentence map of Regime A/B/C, then tie every mover to the regime, e.g., Regime A durability from Azure contracted revenue and Shopify moat (0G3A676BP)(48JXC9VDP)(QFDWCTAYB); (4) prune extraneous narrative (e.g., broad base-case prose and unrelated macro items) and keep the causal chain tight: cloud/AI capex → revenue visibility → margin leverage → FCF → re-rating; (5) quantify with consistent numeric anchors and avoid vague statements; when you cite numbers, show the source ID next to them and ensure no numbers without IDs appear; (6) resolve conflicts by noting where sources imply similar outcomes (MSFT/SHOP anchors for Regime A) but also flag any regulatory or macro caveats (IGP1Q4ZEJ; 9X7XOLXMH) in-draft rather than in separate prose; (7) ensure no trailing citation lists or unrelated sections—keep the feedback self-contained and aligned with four-line Movers plus 1–2 line Outlook. This will yield a clean, decision-ready swing framework with explicit triggers, probababilistic rigor, and a coherent, data-backed causal chain.",
