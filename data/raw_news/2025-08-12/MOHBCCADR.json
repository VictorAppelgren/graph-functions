  "description": "Using the artistry of sports, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art sends its unique \"Get in the Game\" exhibition to Crystal Bridges Museum of Modern Art in Arkansas.",
  "content": "An exhibition aimed at attracting sports fans to an art museum is now going on the road to other museums.\n\nSFMOMA, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, organized the exhibit, Get in the Game: Sports, Art, Culture,\u201d and presented it at its museum last fall through Feb. 18, 2025. The exhibit heads next month to the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas and will be at the P\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami in Florida March-September 2026.\n\nSFMOMA marketed the exhibit by saying it\u2019s art about, and created by, athletes and an opportunity to play on a 22-person foosball table and other artworks.\n\n\u201cAt its heart, Get in the Game: Sports, Art, Culture offers a collection of stories that show how sports impacts our culture and our psyches,\u201d SFMOMA says. \u201cThey\u2019re the type of stories that fuel our collective passion for \u2018the game.\u2019\u201d\n\nFrom the Olympics to the local recreation league, SFMOMA says, the exhibition enables museum goers to \u201cexperience how some of our most iconic images have been formed and unforgettable human stories have played out in the world of sports.\u201d\n\nViewers of the exhibition, according to the Crystal Bridges Museum, can discover the depth of swimmer Diana Nyad\u2019s determination \u201cthrough an unexpected portrait angle\u201d; feel the pressure faced by Billie Jean King through a reenactment of her legendary Battle of the Sexes tennis match against Bobby Riggs, and celebrate Scottie Pippen\u2019s legacy as an NBA superstar \u201cin lustrous ceramic.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition spawned a 169-page book, Get in the Game: Sports, Art, Culture, distributed by Simon & Schuster. Soccer great Megan Rapinoe wrote the forward to the book, and illustrations were done by surfer AJ Dungo, who illustrated the 2019 graphic novel In Waves.\n\nAt Crystal Bridges Museum, the exhibition will present more than 150 sports-related pieces, inviting visitors to \u201cexperience moments of joy, connection and personal resonance,\u201d museum officials say. The pieces will encourage \u201creflection on well-being, mindful action, physical activity and mental health awareness.\u201d\n\nArtists and athletes share a \u201crich, creative expression,\u201d the officials say, and the exhibition calls on visitors to \u201cget in the game and discover interconnections between sports, art and contemporary culture.\u201d\n\nThe exhibition, which is sponsored by Bank of America, begins Sept. 13 and runs through Jan. 26, 2026. Admission is $15 or free for museum members and youths age 18 and under. On Sept. 11, the museum will host an opening lecture by Austen Barron Bailly, the museum\u2019s chief curator, and a conversation with soccer great Mia Hamm, a two-time Olympic gold medalist.\n\nFounded by philanthropist Alice Walton, Crystal Bridges is a nonprofit charitable organization. It opened in 2011 and had nearly 785,00 annual visitors in 2023.",
