  "description": "Josh Williams left Kaulig Racing and has already found a new home in the Nascar Xfinity Series, welcoming Optum Health to Nascar.",
  "content": "Josh Williams is set to return to the Nascar Xfinity Series after parting ways with Kaulig Racing after the 21st race of the 2025 season.\n\nWilliams will make his return next weekend, when the Xfinity Series competes at Daytona. Optum, an information and technology-enabled health services firm, has partnered with Williams to sponsor the No. 45 car for Alpha Prime Racing in four races. Alloy Employer Services, Williams\u2019 longtime partner, will also continue to sponsor his effort.\n\nIn addition to sponsoring the No. 45 car, Optum is also partnering with Williams to sponsor his well-known hospital tour, in which he visits children's hospitals near each race track.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s real important for me to have companies that believe in me, my career, and my dedication to the hospital tour,\u201d Williams said. \u201cAlloy Employer Services has been behind me for years and having Optum join the program is another reminder that what we\u2019re doing matters. This has been a trying time for my family, me and my fans, and the support throughout the garage and my partners has been a bright spot. I\u2019m looking forward to representing Optum at races throughout the year as well as on the Josh Williams Hospital Tour.\"\n\nWilliams will also return to race at the Charlotte Roval, Las Vegas and Phoenix.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that Optum Health has come on board as an official sponsor of Josh Williams, in partnership with Alloy Employer Services,\u201d Chris Estey, CMO at Alloy Employer, said. \u201cThis exciting collaboration brings together Optum\u2019s industry-leading commitment to employee well-being and Alloy\u2019s dedication to proactive risk management, fueling Josh\u2019s drive both on the track and in promoting employee health, safety, and wellness at workplaces across America.\u201d\n\nWilliams signed with Kaulig Racing in 2024 and had high expectations with the No. 11 team. However, after more than a year and a half, both sides recognized it was not working out. Williams had six top 10s in 54 races with the team. Kaulig\u2019s entire Xfinity Series program has struggled this year compared to past results, with only 20 top 10s split between its three cars.\n\nWilliams is well-liked and respected in the Nascar community as one of the few drivers who can completely work on his own racecar if needed. His old-school racer mentality has led him to have a unique presence in Nascar.\n\nNow, as Williams looks ahead, these four races will help him prepare for what\u2019s next in 2026.",

      "text": "Josh Williams will not give up on his dream to be Nascar\u2019s top old-school racer. The Floridian sports a mullet and a goatee that makes him look like a 20th century racecar driver. But he\u2019s really just a 29-year-old who\u2019s hungry to race.\n\u201cI call them helmet holders, seat warmers or steering wheel holders,\u201d Williams said of old-school drivers. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of guys left who can build a car from the ground up, that can pull it down, that can set the bump steering.\n\u201cI want to be the old school guy that brings it back. That\u2019s my goal. To see people recognize it and label me as an old school guy, that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for. That\u2019s how I am, how I\u2019ve always been and I\u2019m not going to change.\u201d\nWilliams believed he\u2019d have a breakthrough 2022 season when he joined BJ McLeod Motorsports in the Nascar Xfinity Series. The move enabled him to make his Cup Series debut for the team McLeod co-owns with Matt Tifft, Live Fast Motorsports, at the Bristol dirt track with a 25th-place finish.\nHowever, he failed to qualify for three of the first eight Xfinity events of the year, a major blow for any team. McLeod eventually maneuvered Wiliams' owner points to solidify his spot in races going forward and he stayed with the team through the first 23 events. He ended up returning to the Mario Gosselin-run DGM Racing, an organization he spent a handful of years with, breaking onto the NASCAR scene. In 2020, Williams scored six top 10s with DGM \u2013 a best finish of sixth at Kansas \u2013 and finished 15th in the championship standings.\n\u201cIn this day and age, it\u2019s so hard because the Xfinity Series is flooded with quite a bit of funding,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult situation because, even if you do have the funding, somebody\u2019s beat you to it. We\u2019re building our brand and growing our partners.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to focus next year on having better equipment. We need to be more prepared and bring really good cars to the racetrack. We gave it 100% effort at Phoenix and we drove inside of the top 10, but had a bad pitstop at the end and ended up 15th. That\u2019s a really good day for us, and you\u2019ll see more of that out of us next year.\u201d\nWilliams ended the year on a strong note with a 15th-place finish at Phoenix. He also ran two more Cup Series events for Live Fast Motorsports. He earned another 25th-place finish at the Indianapolis road course and finished 31st at the Charlotte Roval.\nWhile Williams could take his limited funding to a larger team to run fewer races but in top-tier equipment, he\u2019s focused on growing with the opportunities he currently has.\nThe year of learning, he explained, is one he wants to forget.\n\u201cI would say it was a great learning experience,\u201d Williams said of 2022. \u201cI learned a lot of things about myself. You have to put it into perspective that everybody\u2019s got good years and everybody\u2019s got bad years. I\u2019m going to mark this one up as a rough one and forget about it. I\u2019m focusing on next year and really try to come out strong, run up towards the front and have some successful finishes.\u201d\nOne bright side to Williams\u2019 year, however, is that he\u2019s been nominated for the Comcast Community Champion of the Year for his years of giving back to children. He\u2019s visited over 150 hospitals in person and on Zoom during the pandemic. Through these visits, he\u2019s met with countless children, as well as their families, to show his support.\nAs Williams\u2019 work with children started to expand, he enlisted the help of OhmniLabs to use their Telepresence robots, providing an opportunity for some children to virtually experience at-track garage tours from their hospital beds. This year, he formed a relationship with the Ryan Seacrest Foundation, which builds closed circuit TV and radio studios in children\u2019s hospitals throughout the country to increase experiences for patients who can\u2019t make the trip out to the track.\n\u201cI\u2019ll probably cry a bit,\u201d Williams said if he wins the honor, which will be announced at the end of November. \u201cI\u2019m a softy. It\u2019s super special, not just for me but for the Seacrest Foundation. We\u2019ve been able to work together and visit all of these places. To give back to them on a higher level, that\u2019s amazing.\u201d\nAs Williams focuses on his future, the goal is showcase his talent and get back to his 2020 numbers. He\u2019s using the work ethic he\u2019s had since his days in the ARCA Menards Series, when he competed and worked on cars for his family-owned team.\nEven though Williams has moved up through the rankings, one thing hasn\u2019t changed and that\u2019s his eagerness to work on his own cars. He hasn\u2019t announced his plans for 2023, but expect him to return to the Xfinity Series."

Williams\u2019 stint with Kaulig produced six top\u201110s in 54 races, and he is known for his old\u2011school driving style and ability to work on his own cars.
