  "title": "Xi, Putin Tighten Ties in Beijing With Apparent Gas Breakthrough",
  "description": "President Vladimir Putin appears to have secured a diplomatic win he has sought for years, with a massive pipeline deal that would tie Russia and China together for\u2026",
  "content": "The head of Russia\u2019s Gazprom PJSC, speaking to Russian media in Beijing, said the gas giant has signed a legally binding agreement to build the long-anticipated Power of Siberia 2 pipeline to China via Mongolia. While Beijing has yet to confirm details of the deal, securing any advance in the project is a diplomatic coup for Putin as Moscow grapples with the impact of Western sanctions.\n\nThe announcement came as Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Putin shared bonhomie over tea in Beijing on Tuesday. Xi welcomed Putin by calling him an \u201cold friend\u201d and added that \u201cChina-Russia relations have withstood the test of changing international circumstances.\u201d Putin thanked Xi for the warm welcome and said Russia\u2013China ties \u201care at an unprecedentedly high level.\u201d\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\u2022 There was an error, please provide a valid email address.

Please try again\n\nXi and Putin have pushed their nations closer together since Russia\u2019s full invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. Xi is using a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization security bloc and a major military parade in the Chinese capital this week to tighten relations with Putin and other world leaders, especially Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nProgress on the Power of Siberia 2, though, would set a new benchmark for the closeness of their relationship. Discussions around the mega-project have been stalled for years. While Russia has been eager to advance it in order to compensate for lower European deliveries following the invasion in Ukraine, China has been far more cautious. Gas demand has been slowing and Beijing is wary of excessive dependence on a single supplier.\n\nIn comments made to Russian wires from Beijing, Chief Executive Officer Alexey Miller said the gas producer could ship as much as 50 billion cubic meters a year via the Power of Siberia 2 for 30 years. Gazprom would also increase flows by smaller amounts on two other pipelines to China.\n\nChina has yet to comment on details of the deal. China\u2019s state-owned Xinhua News Agency, reporting on bilateral meetings, did not specifically mention the pipeline, though it reported that the two countries signed more than 20 cooperation agreements, including in the field of energy.\n\nMiller\u2019s comments leave several questions about Power of Siberia 2 unanswered. The price China pays for the gas hasn\u2019t been decided, although it will be lower than what Gazprom currently charges customers in Europe, Miller said, according to the reports.",
