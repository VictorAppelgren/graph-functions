Steam can still be installed on Chromebooks, but it now comes with a notice announcing the end of support.\n\n\u201cThe Steam for Chromebook Beta program will conclude on January 1st, 2026,\" reads the notification. \"After this date, games installed as part of the Beta will no longer be available to play on your device. We appreciate your participation in and contribution to learnings from the beta program, which will inform the future of Chromebook gaming.\u201d\n\nSteam originally launched on Chromebooks in early 2022 as an alpha that ran on just a handful of newer and higher-specced devices with Intel chips inside. A beta version arrived later that year, with reduced system requirements and support for AMD CPUs and GPUs. Between then and now, neither Google nor Valve had said much about it.\n\nThe Steam beta was one component of a \"gaming Chromebook\" push that Google made in 2022 and 2023. It saw the release of laptops with better hardware and high-refresh-rate screens and optimized versions of GeForce Now and Xbox Cloud Gaming. Google had reportedly been working to add Steam support to ChromeOS since at least 2020.",

      "text": "After debuting in 2022, the Steam for Chromebook Beta will stop working in early 2026. At the time, it was a big ChromeOS effort, but there hasn\u2019t been an update in ages.\nEntering \u201cSteam\u201d into the ChromeOS Launcher starts the install process like before, but there\u2019s now an intermediary message: \u201cThe Steam for Chromebook Beta program will conclude on January 1st, 2026. After this date, games installed as part of the Beta will no longer be available to play on your device. We appreciate your participation in and contribution to learnings from the beta program, which will inform the future of Chromebook gaming.\u201d\nAt the time, this was part of a sizable gaming push for ChromeOS. Steam joined Android apps and cloud streaming to provide a third way to play games on Chromebooks. Later in 2022, Google announced the first Gaming Chromebooks.\nSteam for Chromebooks launched in Alpha that March before reaching Beta in November with lower hardware requirements: Intel Core i3 and AMD Ryzen 3 with 8 GB of RAM. However, Core i5 or Ryzen 5 and 16 GB is recommended. It uses the Linux version of a game, with Google maintaining a list of compatible titles, which is currently at 99.\nWhen support ends at the start of next year, existing games that are already installed will be removed. With hindsight, the fact that Steam for Chromebook never entered stable was a pretty good indicator of the effort\u2019s standing.\nGoogle alludes to there being a future for Chromebook gaming. This comes as the technical underpinnings of ChromeOS eventually get migrated to Android. In that regard, there will always be Android apps from the Play Store for local games, as well as streaming services.\nMore on Chromebook:\n- Google specifies how it will be the \u2018ChromeOS experience on top of Android\u2019\n- Google confirms ChromeOS and Android are being merged into \u2018a single platform\u2019\n- Chromebooks are better than ever, but is that enough for Google?\nThanks Noah\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "After prematurely announcing that Steam on Chromebooks was ready for testing last week, Google is making the release official today. The alpha version of Steam on Chrome OS is currently available in the Chrome OS 14583.0.0 Dev channel, as announced via a post in Google's Chrome Developers Community.\nNot all Chromebooks will be able to run Steam, however. Google said only the following machines can try the alpha:\n- Acer Chromebook 514 (CB514-1W)\n- Acer Chromebook 515 (CB515-1W)\n- Acer Chromebook Spin 713 (CP713-3W)\n- Asus Chromebook Flip CX5 (CX5500)\n- Asus Chromebook CX9 (CX9400)\n- HP Pro c640 G2 Chromebook\n- Lenovo 5i-14 Chromebook\n\"Because many games have high performance demands, we\u2019ve focused our efforts thus far on a set of devices where more games can run well,\" Google said.\nChromebooks also need to hit specific requirements to run Steam, including an Intel 11th-gen Core i5 CPU, Intel Iris Xe graphics, and 8GB of RAM. Google made it clear that using a supported machine with a lesser configuration\u2014such as one that includes an i3 CPU or 4GB of RAM\u2014will not cut it. In fact, you may want higher specs to run some games, like The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, two games Google claimed work well with the alpha."

      "text": "We have a wild report from Android Police this morning, as the site claims that Google is working to bring official Steam support to Chrome OS. Yes, Valve's Steam. The gaming platform. On Chromebooks.\nThe story apparently comes from a direct source: Kan Liu, the director of product management for Chrome OS. During an interview with Liu at CES, the site says Liu \"implied, though would not directly confirm, that Google was working in direct cooperation with Valve on this project.\" The idea is that, according the Liu, \"gaming is the single most popular category of downloads for Play Store content on Chromebooks,\" and Steam would mean even more games.\nAnyone can put Steam on Chrome OS now. Chrome OS supports Linux apps. Steam has a Linux client and sells Linux games. You can install Steam and use it as a Chrome OS game store right now. You wouldn't get the entire Windows collection of Steam games, but there is a modest-and-growing collection of games that support Linux. No one does this because Chromebooks are not gaming hardware. They usually have just enough GPU power to run YouTube, scroll a webpage, and that's about it\u20143D graphics are not really going to happen. To make matters worse, Chrome OS' hardware acceleration for the Linux sandbox is actually pretty bad, and nearly identical hardware can run games at a higher FPS using Windows or a real distribution of Linux.\nThere's also the issue that Google already has a gaming-focused solution for Chromebooks: the Stadia game-streaming platform. Stadia offloads game rendering to the cloud and only streams a live video to your Chromebook, so it doesn't require hot-and-heavy gaming hardware. It's a perfect solution for a light, limited Chromebook. A push for Steam on Chromebooks would muddy Google's Chrome OS gaming strategy. Muddying its own strategies with competing products is something Google is really good at, though."

      "text": "It has been almost three years since Chromebook users got word that Steam support is coming to ChromeOS. We're still not totally there yet, but today Google announced that it's ready to enter beta testing.\nIn a blog post, Zach Alcorn, Google product manager, announced that Steam on Chromebooks is available as a beta with ChromeOS 108.0.5359.24 and later. Steam on ChromeOS entered alpha in March, and Alcorn said the updates announced today are based on \"thousands of gameplay reports.\"\nAMD support\nThe Steam on ChromeOS alpha required not just an Intel CPU, but also an Intel 11th-gen Core i5 chip with Intel's Iris Xe graphics. The beta supports Intel's latest 12th-gen chips and extends support to Team Red. Alcorn said the beta supports AMD's Ryzen 5000 C-Series CPUs.\nGoogle's beta also lowers spec requirements to an i3 CPU in the case of Intel-based Chromebooks, while AMD Chromebooks require a Ryzen 3 chip or greater.\nThe RAM requirement has also dropped from 16GB of RAM to 8GB.\nHowever, Alcorn said an i5 or Ryzen 5 and 16GB is still recommended \"for the best experience.\" In fact, some supported games will only work with 16GB of memory. As is the case with any local gaming, the more powerful the machine you have, the better the performance you can expect.\nChromebooks that support Steam testing\nWith these updated requirements, the number of Chromebooks that can test Steam has tripled. Below is the full list of supported devices that Alcorn shared. Unsurprisingly, they include the high-refresh rate (up to 144 Hz) cloud-gaming Chromebooks announced last month.\n- Acer Chromebook 514 (CB514-1W)\n- Acer Chromebook 515 (CB515-1W)\n- Acer Chromebook 516 GE\n- Acer Chromebook Spin 514 (CP514-3H, CP514-3HH, CP514-3WH)\n- Acer Chromebook Spin 713 (CP713-3W)\n- Acer Chromebook Spin 714 (CP714-1WN)\n- Acer Chromebook Vero 514\n- Asus Chromebook CX9 (CX9400)\n- Asus Chromebook Flip CX5 (CX5500)\n- Asus Chromebook Flip CX5 (CX5601)\n- Asus Chromebook Vibe CX55 Flip\n- Framework Laptop Chromebook Edition\n- HP Elite c640 14 inch G3 Chromebook\n- HP Elite c645 G2 Chromebook\n- HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook\n- HP Pro c640 G2 Chromebook\n- Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming Chromebook 16\n- Lenovo 5i-14 Chromebook\n- Lenovo Flex 5i Chromebook 14\n- Lenovo ThinkPad C14"

      "text": "The final nail is all but driven into Google Stadia's coffin, with Google announcing that it will shut down the game streaming service on January 18. In a meeting with the press this week, Google said it still sees cloud gaming as a huge profit driver for the company moving ahead. With Stadia on its way out, though, Google will have to rely on gaming platforms and manufacturing partners. Today, three so-called gaming Chromebooks were announced from Acer, Asus, and Lenovo, boasting high specs for Chromebooks, including refresh rates up to 144 Hz. Google said it optimized the devices for streaming games from Nvidia GeForce Now, Amazon Luna, and the Xbox Cloud Gaming beta.\nGaming Chromebooks: Specs and features\nThe Acer Chromebook 516 GE, Asus Chromebook Vibe CX55 Flip (CX5501) 2-in-1, and Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming Chromebook announced today stand out with more premium specs than the average, more budget-friendly Chromebook, including higher-resolution screens that support gamer-level refresh rates and beefier CPUs. Google said the computers range from $399\u2013$799.\nHere's a quick overview of the specs:\n| Model | CPU | RAM | SSD | Display | Price |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Acer Chromebook 516 GE | Up to Intel Core i7-1260P | 8GB LPDDR4x (speed not specified) | 256GB NVMe-PCIe 3.0 SSD | 16-inch 2560\u00d71600 @ 120 Hz IPS | $650 with an i5-1240P |\n| Asus Chromebook Vibe CX55 (CX5501) | Up to Intel Core i7-1165G7 | Up to 16GB (type and speed not specified) | Not specified | 15.6-inch 1920\u00d71080 touchscreen @ 144 Hz | Price TBD |\n| Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming Chromebook | Up to Intel Core i5-1235U | 8GB LPDDR4x-4266 | Up to 512GB PCIe 2242 SSD | 16-inch 2560\u00d71600 @ 120 Hz IPS | Starts at $599 |\nThe systems go up to Intel i7 CPUs, but Google said it tested game streaming with i5 and i3 chips with \"phenomenal\" results. The Acer and Asus laptops also come with HDMI 2.1 and 2.0, respectively, leaving the potential for a decent gaming monitor.\nBut can\u2019t other Chromebooks stream games, too?\nIt's important to note that any Chromebook, so long as it meets the streaming platform's requirements, could use these cloud services, (albeit max resolution and framerates would be limited, depending on the system). The big difference is that Google purportedly optimized these three machines for streaming games from the cloud, including from the chipset to ChromeOS' core constructs.\nIn its press briefing, Google said it optimized the three Chromebooks to run three partner streaming platforms (via downloadable web apps): Nvidia GeForce Now, which is launching a new Chromebook streaming mode that supports 1600p at 120 fps, Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming beta, and Amazon Luna. Notably, Xbox Cloud Gaming and Luna don't support resolutions higher than 1080p."
