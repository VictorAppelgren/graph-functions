State the regime (e.g., “U.S. real rates > euro‑zone real rates by 0.5 pp in 2025”) and the transition condition (e.g., “once the tariff‑induced cost‑of‑production gap exceeds 1 pp, the dollar will appreciate by 0.3 pp”).  \n\n2. **Map the causal chain to market pricing** – show how the anchor drives the BoP, which feeds into the BoP‑reaction function (e.g., “ΔBoP = α Δreal‑rate + β Δterms‑of‑trade”), then to the exchange‑rate dynamics (e.g., “ΔUSD = γ ΔBoP”), and finally to the equity valuation (e.g., “ΔP/E ≈ δ ΔUSD + ε Δgrowth‑rate”). Use the article’s numbers (Tesla revenue $107 bn, gross margin 17.9 %【P0K0UEOHU】; Rivian EBITDA breakeven 2027, R2 price $45k【P0K0UEOHU】) to quantify the impact of each link.  \n\n3. **Scenario structure** – present a clear “Base‑Case” (e.g., tariff lift in Q3 2025, Fed rate hike 25 bps, Tesla’s robotaxi pilot expands to 5 cities), a “Best‑Case” (tariff removal, AI‑driven margin lift 5 pp for Amazon, R2 volume 200k units), and a “Worst‑Case” (tariff escalation, AI slowdown, Tesla’s robotaxi fails). For each, give projected EPS, P/E, and implied price.  \n\n4. **Quantify catalysts, triggers, and invalidation points** – e.g., “If Amazon’s AI‑automation reduces logistics cost by 2 pp, margin will rise 3 pp, boosting EPS by $0.15 (≈ 10 % of current EPS)【P0K0UEOHU】.” List specific numbers: “Rivian’s R2 launch in Q1 2026 → volume 150k → EBITDA margin 12 % → EBITDA $30 m.”  \n\n5. **Citation density & correctness** – every numeric claim must be tagged with the source ID (e.g., “$107 bn revenue【P0K0UEOHU】”). Ensure all critical sources are covered: Tesla’s Q2 2024 revenue drop 16 %【P0K0UEOHU】, Amazon’s Q2 2024 earnings beat【P0K0UEOHU】, HealthStream’s ROE 5.8 %【YTHAU3SIB】, etc.  \n\n6. **Avoid generic platitudes** – replace “market is volatile” with “the Nasdaq Composite is up 10 % YTD, but AI‑valuation sentiment has spiked 15 % in the last month【P0K0UEOHU】.”  \n\n7. **Structure & length** – keep the piece under 800 words, with a 1‑paragraph intro, 3‑paragraph body (anchor, causal chain, scenarios), and a 1‑paragraph conclusion (base case, key risks, watch list, confidence rating).  \n\n8. **Conclusion** – state a clear base‑case price target (e.g., “Amazon $3,200 (≈ +15 % from current $2,800)”), list top 3 risks (tariff escalation, AI slowdown, Tesla’s robotaxi regulatory hurdle), and a confidence level (e.g., “moderate – 60 % probability of hitting target”).  \n\nImplementing these edits will transform the draft into a rigorous, data‑driven, multi‑year analysis that meets the SECTION FOCUS and exceeds the reviewer’s criteria.",
