  "description": "The 300 companies on this year's list offer employees challenging work, competitive compensation, career advancement opportunities and work-life balance.",
  "content": "orking in technology-focused roles can be intense. Frequently, the jobs are fast-paced, filled with complex intellectual challenges, and involve continual upskilling to stay current\u2014all of which can cause extreme burnout. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that some companies are updating their policies and benefits to attract top tech talent who may be looking for greener pastures.\n\n\u201cA lot of large tech companies are beginning to recognize that there\u2019s an opportunity here,\u201d says David Smith, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. Employers are \u201crecognizing that we have to account for the impact that work\u2014and life outside of work\u2014can have on our overall ability to perform,\u201d he says. \u201cBurned out employees don\u2019t perform at the levels that you\u2019re looking for\u2014and you\u2019re going to have a hard time retaining them. They\u2019re going to look for something else.\u201d\n\nThe employers that are more likely to retain tech workers, Smith says, understand that employees want the ability to customize their benefits and work arrangements to accommodate their specific needs. For instance, some workers may be caring for children while others are caring for aging parents, or employees \u201cmight be in that sandwich generation caring for both of them,\u201d he says. And the companies that enable workers to pursue their careers while fulfilling their roles outside of work will have an edge over other employers.\n\nSemiconductor firm Micron Technology, based in Boise, Idaho, has taken employee health and caregiving considerations seriously, with on-site childcare centers, nearby health clinics and fitness areas. The company also offers financial wellness benefits including retirement plans and stock purchase plans, \u201cMicron\u2019s wellbeing programs support physical, mental, social, career and financial health, so our team members can thrive both inside and outside of work,\u201d says Fran Dillard, vice president of Micron\u2019s global culture, workforce and talent acquisition. Micron even offers \u201cteam member advocates\u201d who help employees navigate insurance plans and flexible work arrangements. \u201cWe invest in our people\u2019s whole selves,\u201d says Dillard.\n\nThis investment in employees is no doubt a large part of the reason Micron Technology earned the No. 3 spot on Forbes\u2019 list of America\u2019s Best Employers For Tech Workers 2025.\n\nThe second-annual list, made in partnership with research firm Statista, surveyed more than 25,000 tech workers across all industries at companies with at least 1,000 employees in the United States. The respondents, who primarily work in IT or tech-focused jobs\u2014including software development, data analysis, technical support and cybersecurity\u2014were asked whether they would recommend their current employer, any previous employer (within the last two years) and companies they knew through peers in their industry, or through friends or family who worked there.\n\nParticipants were also asked to share their opinions on their current employer based on criteria including salary and benefits, advancement opportunities, management style, whether there is an environment of fairness and trust, and if the company has a positive reputation. Data from the past three years of Forbes-Statista employee surveys was included.\n\nThe responses were collected and analyzed, with the most recent data from current employees weighted more heavily than data from past employees or those who had never worked for the company. Each employer was then given a score, and the 300 companies with the highest scores made our list of America\u2019s Best Employers For Tech Workers of 2025.\n\nTopping the list this year was Microsoft (No. 1), which rose from No. 8 in 2024, followed by Google (No. 2), which jumped from No. 5 last year. Rounding out the top five\u2014in addition to Micron Technology\u2019s No.-3 ranking (a marked rise from its No. 52 ranking in 2024)\u2014was Salesforce, which maintained its No. 4 spot from last year, and Computer Task Group at No. 5.\n\nComing in at No. 7 was Cincinnati Children\u2019s, which credits its success to the training resources available to its technical staff, which includes biomedical engineers, network engineers, cybersecurity experts, medical records personnel, and a virtual reality development team. \u201cThis investment is vital to ensure our staff remains at the top of their skill level given the rapid changes in our field,\u201d says Tony Johnston, the hospital\u2019s senior vice president of information services and chief information officer.\n\nCincinnati Children\u2019s also offers flexibility to its tech staff members with both hybrid and full-time remote work options. Other benefits include generous leave plans (including 100% paid short-term disability for up to 6 weeks, followed by 80% paid leave), education assistance, retirement plans (with the option of individual consultations) and in-house mental health counseling.\n\nLabcorp (No. 10), a global laboratory services company that made the list for the first time this year, says a main driver attracting tech talent to the company is its focus on bettering the wellbeing of patients and the community through innovative technologies. \u201cWhat sets us apart is the opportunity for our tech teams to work at the intersection of health, science and cutting-edge technology,\u201d says Bola Oyegunwa, the company\u2019s executive vice president and chief information and technology officer. \u201cWhether it\u2019s programming robotics for automated lab testing, deploying cloud-native applications or leveraging generative AI to solve complex healthcare challenges, our teams are deeply embedded in meaningful work to advance our mission to improve health and improve lives.\u201d\n\nLabcorp also offers a broad range of learning and mentorship opportunities so that workers can advance in their careers. \u201cI\u2019ve seen firsthand how managers prioritize individual development\u2014even if it means stepping outside traditional roles to explore new skills,\u201d adds Bola Oyegunwa. \u201cMany of our tech leaders started their careers here years ago and grew through stretch assignments and cross-functional collaboration.\u201d\n\nThe company offers unique perks, like free laboratory testing at any of Labcorp\u2019s 2,000 Patient Service Centers, along with more traditional benefits such as a health savings account, tuition reimbursement and medical, dental and life insurance options.\n\nAt Arizona-based electronics manufacturer Microchip Technology (No. 21), which rose from No. 99 last year, many employees are motivated by the company\u2019s training programs. And these programs don\u2019t just cover advanced technical skills but also include managerial skills, such as leadership development, conflict management and mentorship, says Steve Sanghi, the CEO of Microchip. One of the many benefits of this in-house training is that up to 50% of the jobs at Microchip are filled internally. And when there aren\u2019t any current openings, the company often finds opportunities for employees to work on other assignments or new tasks that will help them grow depending on the person\u2019s interests and goals. This is in addition to the company\u2019s flexible work policies, profit-sharing and stock option benefits and on-site medical centers.\n\nAt the heart of the company\u2019s philosophy, Sanghi says, is the idea that the employee organization chart should be flipped upside down because the employees in the trenches\u2014who understand the work best\u2014are trusted to make their own decisions about which projects to pursue rather than taking orders from on high. And because there\u2019s less interference from above, \u201cthe work gets done faster, the decisions get made faster,\u201d says Sanghi, and \u201cthe employees really like the culture of empowerment.\u201d\n\nTo find other companies that provide a culture of employee empowerment, growth and satisfaction, check out our full list of America\u2019s Best Employers For Tech Workers here.\n\nTo create this second-annual list of America\u2019s Best Employer For Tech Workers, Forbes partnered with market research firm Statista and surveyed more than 25,000 tech workers in the United States employed at companies across all sectors with at least 1,000 people in the country. Tech workers were defined as professionals who identified themselves as having a job focused on \u201ctech\u201d or \u201cIT functions,\u201d including software development, cybersecurity, cloud computing, data project management, technical support and more.\n\nSurvey respondents were asked how likely they would be to recommend their current employer, their previous employer (within the past two years), and companies they knew through peers in their industry, or through friends or family who worked there. Current workers were also asked to evaluate their employers based on such criteria as: salary, professional development opportunities, workplace flexibility, the ability of employees to express ideas and opinions openly, and if the company has a reputation for being technologically progressive. Data from the past three years of Forbes-Statista employee surveys was included.\n\nResponses were tallied and analyzed, with data from current employees weighted more heavily than older data or than responses from past employees or people who had never worked at the company. Each employer was then given a score, and the top 300 companies made our list of America\u2019s Best Employers For Tech Workers 2025.\n\nAs with all Forbes lists, companies pay no fee to participate or be selected.

      "text": "Everything you need to know about how we produce Forbes Best Employers Lists\nBy Rachel Rabkin Peachman\nE ach year, Forbes produces numerous lists celebrating the best employers in a range of categories\u2014from companies that set an example in their support for veterans to organizations leading the way in their approach to pay equity. How do we go about creating those lists? Unlike many other lists, we do not solicit or accept submissions. For our employer rankings (listed below), Forbes partners with market research firm Statista, which surveys thousands of employees and conducts extensive research and data analysis to identify top companies, institutions and organizations in their respective categories around the country and the world.\nWhile the methodological details vary by list, they share commonalities, which we address below through answers to the most frequently asked questions we receive about our employer lists.\n*TAKE FORBES BEST EMPLOYERS SURVEY BELOW\nWho is Statista?\nStatista is a global data and business intelligence platform offering a collection of statistics, reports and insights on more than 80,000 topics from 22,500 sources in 170 industries. Its Ranking division (Statista R)\u2014dedicated to the creation of company, brand, and product rankings and lists\u2014is Forbes\u2019 longtime research and data partner. With a team of more than 100 analysts, Statista R provides market research and data analysis, proprietary surveys and access to thousands of consumers, all of which form the basis of Forbes employer lists and rankings.\nWhich employer lists does Forbes produce each year, and when are they published?\nCurrently, Forbes produces the following employer lists with Statista annually, with a few exceptions noted below. Typically, each list is published in the same month it was published the previous year.\n- Canada\u2019s Best Employers (January)\n- America\u2019s Best Large Employers (February)\n- America\u2019s Best Midsize Employers (February)\n- America\u2019s Best Startup Employers (March)\n- America\u2019s Best Employers For Diversity (April)*\n- America\u2019s Best Employers For New Grads (May)\n- Canada\u2019s Best Employers For Diversity (July)*\n- Canada\u2019s Best Employers For Company Culture (July)\n- America\u2019s Best Employers For Women (July)\n- America\u2019s Best Employers By State (August)\n- America\u2019s Best Employers For Tech Workers (September)\n- World\u2019s Best Employers (October)\n- World\u2019s Top Companies For Women (October)\n- America\u2019s Best Employers For Engineers (Oct/Nov)\n- America\u2019s Best Employers For Veterans (November)\n- America\u2019s Dream Employers (November)\n*May not be published each year.\nCan companies register to be considered for a list?\nCompanies do not need to register to be eligible for consideration. Some lists are based primarily on surveys; others rely largely on company research\u2014or on a combination of both. In conducting its surveys, Statista asks respondents to name the companies they want to evaluate. An autofill function aids this process. Respondents can also write in any company. To ensure that a company is included in the autofill prompt, email a request to forbeslists@statista.com. (Note, though, that doing so will not impact whether a company makes a list.)\nFor lists based primarily on metrics\u2014such as a company\u2019s growth, revenue, reputation, programs and employee benefits\u2014Statista\u2019s analysts first identify a pool of companies in each category, which is further narrowed down through the list\u2019s criteria. Statista then conducts desk research and analysis of publicly available data on each company to determine the final list. As with survey-based lists, Forbes does not accept submissions from companies, but companies are welcome to email Statista at forbeslists@statista.com to ensure inclusion in the autofill prompt.\nHow are companies evaluated?\nCompanies must meet several benchmarks to be eligible for consideration. Depending on the category being ranked, initial qualifying criteria may include metrics such as employee count, number of years in business, industry category and location. Beyond that, the specific evaluating factors\u2014including survey responses\u2014are incorporated into a scoring model that is unique to the methodology of each list. The companies with the highest scores are included on the final list.\nIs there a fee to be considered or selected for placement on a list?\nNo. Unlike outlets that charge companies a fee to be considered or selected for a \u201cBest Of\u201d list\u2014a practice known as \u201cpay to play\u201d\u2014Forbes does not. Forbes employer lists are driven by survey results and research.\nWho are the survey respondents, and can I participate in a survey?\nThe answer depends on the methodology of each list. If a list involves a survey, as it does for America\u2019s Best Large Employers, prospective participants may access the survey in the following ways:\n- The bulk of survey respondents are drawn from online access panels, composed of people who have agreed to participate in online market research or were recruited through organizations that share surveys with their professional members. To this end, Statista uses a handful of survey companies that maintain online international access panels. Survey respondents provide demographic information, enabling each survey company to collect a representative sample of people on any given topic. (Note that Statista is not given personally identifiable information about respondents, and respondents are not told which company has commissioned the survey or how the results will be used.)\n- Forbes Best Employers survey is accessible year-round, allowing responses to be incorporated into various lists when applicable. Eligible participants may take the survey at any time (directly below), and those responses will be sorted into corresponding categories and included in the upcoming year\u2019s analysis. For those who are interested in being a respondent for an employer list, please take the anonymous survey here.\nTake Forbes Best Employers Survey\nI noticed that Forbes produces other lists with Statista in addition to the employer lists. How can I participate in those lists?\nYes, Forbes partners with Statista on the following additional lists:\n- America\u2019s Best Management Consulting Firms (March)\n- World\u2019s Best Banks (April)\n- America\u2019s Best Executive Recruiting Firms, America\u2019s Best Professional Recruiting Firms, and America\u2019s Best Temporary Staffing Firms (May)\n- World\u2019s Best Insurance Companies\u2014Homeowners, Auto, Life (June)\n- America\u2019s Best Banks In Each State and Americas Best Credit Unions In Each State (June)\n- Canada\u2019s Best Executive Recruiting Firms, Canada\u2019s Best Professional Recruiting Firms, and Canada\u2019s Best Temporary Staffing Firms (July)\n- World\u2019s Best Management Consulting Firms (August)\n- America\u2019s Best Insurance Companies (September)\nAs is the case with the employer lists, Forbes does not accept submissions for the above lists, and each is constructed using its own methodology grounded in data obtained through surveys and research. While Forbes does not offer year-round surveys for the lists directly above, for some, you may pre-register to participate (see below), and you\u2019ll be alerted when the list\u2019s survey period opens.\nPre-register for America\u2019s Best Recruiting And Temp Staffing Firms Surveys\nPre-register for Canada\u2019s Best Recruiting And Temp Staffing Firms Surveys\nFor a few lists that don\u2019t have a pre-registration option, Forbes publishes callouts\u2014such as this one\u2014during the list\u2019s annual open survey period. Eligible participants may take those surveys while they are active. If the current year\u2019s survey period is closed, you may search for the following year\u2019s callout on Forbes.com, typically three to five months before that list\u2019s publication month.\nWhere can I send a correction about my company\u2019s information?\nPlease email listdesk@forbes.com. This inbox primarily fields messages about lists run with Statista (and with HundredX, another Forbes data partner). Forbes\u2019 staff will update the information on our website and in our database as soon as possible. (For general correction requests unrelated to Statista lists, please email corrections@forbes.com.)\nWhere can I ask a question about my company\u2019s scoring?\nPlease email forbeslists@statista.com. As Forbes\u2019 data partner, Statista\u2019s analysts are best equipped to answer questions about scoring, methodology details, and data collection and analysis."
