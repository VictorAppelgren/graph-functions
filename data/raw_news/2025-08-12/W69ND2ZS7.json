They settled shortly after.\n\"Grateful to have finished the process of dissolving my marriage with Jeff with support from each other and everyone who reached out to us in kindness, and looking forward to next phase as co-parents and friends,\" MacKenzie wrote in her first tweet. \"Happy to be giving him all of my interests in the Washington Post, Blue Origin, and 75 [percent] of our Amazon stock plus voting control of my shares to support his continued contributions with the teams of these incredible companies. Excited about my own plans. Grateful for the past as I look forward to what comes next.\"\nBezos responded with a tweet of his own, thanking MacKenzie for her \"support and kindness in this process.\"\n\"I\u2019m so grateful to all my friends and family for reaching out with encouragement and love.

I\u2019m grateful for her support and for her kindness in this process and am very much looking forward to our new relationship as friends and co-parents.\"\n\"In all our work together, MacKenzie's abilities have been on full display. She has been an extraordinary partner, ally, and mother. She is resourceful and brilliant and loving, and as our futures unroll, I know I'll always be learning from her,\" he concluded.\nBezos didn't have a prenup with Scott, and the separation left her with a 4% stake in the online shopping giant, or around $36 billion at the time.\n\"Bezos handled his first divorce as fast as an Amazon delivery,\" Christopher Melcher, an attorney and partner at Walzer Melcher & Yoda LLP, told Fox News Digital of Bezos' first marriage. \"It was quick but not painless. Billions of dollars were at stake, which were earned during marriage and had to be split because there was no premarital agreement.\"\nTony Gonzalez\nGonzalez and S\u00e1nchez began dating in 2000.

There was friction [at the beginning]. But Tony and [his wife October] were at Thanksgiving with us [this year], and we're really good friends,\" she said.\n\"That took about five years, but we always communicated. I'm not saying that being best friends with your ex is the end-all be-all \u2014 but you do need to be able to communicate.\n\"I'm so proud of it. My son looks at me, and he's like, 'I'm the luckiest boy in the world because I can have Thanksgiving with both my parents, and they don't have to be married.'\"\nHenry Simmons\nS\u00e1nchez was briefly engaged to \"NYPD Blue\" star Henry Simmons in the early 2000s.\nNot much is known about their relationship, but it was reported that S\u00e1nchez called off her engagement with Simmons shortly after meeting her ex-husband, Patrick Whitesell.\nPatrick Whitesell\nPatrick Whitesell and S\u00e1nchez tied the knot in 2005.

According to TMZ, the former couple's assets and properties were divided per the agreement.\nAccording to People, celebrity divorce lawyer Laura Wasser mediated the divorce agreement.\nSanchez and Whitesell were married for 13 years before filing for divorce in April 2019.

The outlet noted that the wedding party has water cabs ready to escort guests to the Italian city. A city ordinance has already been sent out, blocking off traffic from 6 PM to midnight between Madonna dell'Orto and nearby streets, the outlet reported.\nThe party is reportedly being held in the Sant'Alvise complex, which is a 14th century church, monastery, and Barco. Per Vanity Fair, Bezos will be escorted by 10 bodyguards during the kick-off party and the Italian government has recruited reinforcements to maintain the privacy and safety of all attendees amid recent protests."
