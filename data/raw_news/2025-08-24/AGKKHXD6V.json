  "title": "Gaming Headsets Are Overrated, Here's What I Use Instead",
  "description": "Precise positional audio isn\u2019t limited to gaming headsets.",
  "content": "If you primarily play online games, your headset is a crucial piece of gear. It provides a real advantage by helping you pinpoint where your enemies are. However, the truth is that a \u201cgaming\u201d headset isn\u2019t necessarily the best tool for the job. Here's why.\n\nThe Many Downsides of Gaming Headsets\n\nGaming headsets are often marketed as the ultimate solution for hearing footsteps in games, but that isn\u2019t necessarily true. While some models are tuned specifically for gaming, simply slapping the \u201cgaming\u201d label on a set of headphones and adding a built-in mic and some RGB lights does not magically make them better.\n\nMore often than not, there is a mismatch between price and performance. Much of the cost goes to premium \u201cgaming\u201d branding, design, and flashy lights. The built-in microphone on most gaming headsets is serviceable and fine for Discord, but it's unlikely to impress anyone.\n\nThe worst part of gaming headsets is the sound quality. They rarely match even entry-level audiophile headphones that cost a third as much. They might work fine for games, but you won\u2019t enjoy listening to music on them, as even AirPods and most other decent earbuds typically outperform gaming cans in non-gaming tasks.\n\nSound quality and price aside, one of the biggest issues with most gaming headsets is that they use a closed-back design. While this is great for preventing sound from leaking in or out of your headphones, it is not ideal for competitive gaming.\n\nWhat you want instead is a pair of open-back audiophile headphones. In addition to offering far better sound quality than gaming headsets, open-backs have a wide, natural-sounding soundstage that makes them feel more true-to-life.\n\nThis works because open-back headphones use vents or grills behind the driver that let air and sound pass through. With less sound bouncing around inside the earcups, there are fewer reflections and standing waves that muddy the audio.\n\nAnother benefit of this design is better transient response. As Audio-Technica explains, transient response describes how quickly the headphone drivers can react to sudden changes in the audio signal. For instance, percussive sounds like gunfire and footsteps are reproduced more sharply and cleanly compared to closed-back cans.\n\nThis superior clarity and sound separation can provide a real advantage in competitive shooters, as it's easier to detect approaching footsteps and their direction, even during intense gunfights around an objective.\n\nAll in all, using open-back headphones resembles using a surround sound speaker setup, except without the need for good room acoustics. You get spacious, accurate audio that makes it easier to locate footsteps in online games, while single-player worlds feel more open and immersive thanks to the added detail and separation.\n\nI own the Sennheiser HD 599 open-back headphones and the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless gaming headset (which SteelSeries generously provided), and I consistently find spatial audio to be more precise and realistic on the Sennheisers. Plus, the Sennheisers are significantly lighter since they're open-back and wired, which makes them more comfortable for all-day listening.\n\nAlthough the SteelSeries headset offers plenty of per-game sound profiles, I find them to be more of a gimmick than a useful feature with a competitive advantage. This is probably because any well-designed FPS already has a headphone-optimized audio mix built in that provides excellent spatial awareness without the need for extra tweaking.\n\nSingle-player games benefit from open-back cans as well. Individual sounds in the environment and soundtrack are easier to pick apart, making the whole experience feel more immersive and natural-sounding.\n\nWhile some gaming headsets are open-back and share these benefits, your choices are limited. Examples include the Drop PC38X (previously Sennheiser + Drop), the Corsair Virtuoso Pro, and the Turtle Beach Atlas Air. However, these still suffer from the typical downsides of gaming headsets, like inflated prices and underwhelming sound quality compared to similarly priced audiophile headphones.\n\nYou Can Pair Them With a Better Mic\n\nIf you are paying good money for a decent gaming headset, there is a good chance the included microphone will not be horrendous.\n\nHowever, once you factor in the premium you are paying for the \u201cgaming\u201d label, it becomes clear that you could get far better value by investing in a quality standalone microphone and a pair of audiophile headphones instead.\n\nMy Shure MV6 is a phenomenal dynamic mic that holds its own against more expensive Shure models, though the price might be steep for some. Before Shure sent me this mic, I used the HyperX SoloCast, a compact and affordable condenser mic that still outperforms any headset microphone by a wide margin.\n\nPlus, I find it more convenient to keep my mic and headphones separate. A standalone mic can be used for streaming, recording, or work calls with speakers, and if your headphones ever break or you decide to upgrade them, you will not lose your microphone along with them, like you would with a headset.\n\nOnce you get a pair of decent-sounding cans, it\u2019s hard to settle for anything less. You\u2019ll want to use them for gaming, music, movies, calls, and even YouTube. I found myself doing exactly that after replacing my old gaming headset with a pair of Sennheisers.\n\nThe best part is that a good set of headphones can last for years. Unlike phones, computers, or even cameras, headphones don\u2019t evolve rapidly. If you like their sound signature (the frequency response that shapes how they sound) now, chances are you\u2019ll still enjoy it ten years from today.\n\nBrands like Sennheiser, Audio-Technica, Beyerdynamic, Sony, and Philips are known for excellent build quality, and their headphones are built to last. Many people report using the same pair daily for over a decade\u2014a level of longevity you\u2019re unlikely to get from most gaming headsets.\n\nIn fact, they'll last you so long if you take care of them that you'll probably want to buy more audiophile headphones before those kick the bucket. Before you know it, you'll become a headphone collector.\n\nWhile I've praised open-back headphones for their phenomenal spatial sound and clarity, they do have some drawbacks.\n\nFirst and foremost, open-back headphones leak a lot of sound. Everyone in the room can hear your games and your well-behaved teammates This isn\u2019t an issue if you\u2019re gaming alone, but it can be disruptive if someone else is around. My PC is in my bedroom, so as much as I love gaming on my Sennheisers, I usually switch to my SteelSeries headset when my wife wants to sleep or scroll through her phone in peace.\n\nSound leakage also works the other way\u2014you hear everything around you, including loud PC fans when the graphics card heats up during gaming sessions. Active noise cancellation isn\u2019t really an option either. So, if you live with loud roommates or in a noisy area, be prepared for distractions that'll ruin the immersion, or just don't get open-back headphones.\n\nThat said, it's worth pointing out here that audiophile closed-back headphones are a thing, such as the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x. While these won't have the same airy soundstage of open-back cans, they're still overall a better option than gaming headsets.\n\nAnother downside of open-back audiophile headphones is that they\u2019re typically wired-only. Cables can be inconvenient, which is why I reach for my SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless or my GameBuds when gaming on my TV or laptop.\n\nAlthough wireless audiophile headphones are a thing, most of them are Bluetooth-only, which introduces a lot of latency\u2014honestly, that's a dealbreaker for competitive gaming. If you must have wireless headphones, then you might be better off with a wireless gaming headset that uses a proprietary 2.4GHz dongle, since its latency is much lower and essentially not an issue in practice.\n\nIf you can live with a wired setup and want the best overall sound quality along with excellent spatial audio for competitive shooters, open-back audiophile headphones will give you the best experience. While they leak sound and aren\u2019t wireless, nothing else can match their sound accuracy, especially at a significantly lower price than high-end gaming headsets.",

      "text": "Summary\n- When it comes to headphones, finding the perfect pair is like chasing a unicorn.\n- Surviving with imperfect headphones is the name of the game, settling into a comfort zone of acceptable audio quality.\nI have a drawer full of (somewhat) expensive headphones, and even more that I've sold, gifted, or thrown away over the years. I'm by no means an audiophile, but despite my best efforts I can never just be happy with a single pair. Is it me, or is it the headphone makers who are wrong?\nMy Headphone Journey Has Been Long\nThe first ever set of headphones I used was a revelation to me. I was about six or seven years old, and we had a pair of over-ear headphones hooked up to the family Hi-Fi of which I didn't know the brand or anything else. All I know is that the music sounded so much better on these headphones, where I could close my eyes and pick out every instrument from my mom's classical music compilations.\nI don't think I'll ever experience such a huge jump in music fidelity and immersion ever again in my life, but ever since, I've always been chasing the headphones that would give me that same sort of feeling. That warm, balanced sound, where you can pick out and unpack the layers of music in the soundscape. Money is always an issue, and for a long time I had to simply deal with whatever perceived imperfections my current headphones had. After all, it's way more productive to focus on the positives, than fixate on a minor flaw!\nThings were definitely complicated by the death of the headphone jack, and the rise of Bluetooth headphones. I really love the convenience of true wireless buds, but especially in the early years the actual listening experience on something like standard Airpods was shockingly bad.\nThe Perfect Headphones Just Don\u2019t Exist\nFor me, I don't think I'll ever find the \"perfect\" set of headphones for my needs. I definitely don't want to walk down the path of madness represented by audiophilia and headphones that cost as much as a used car. I'm sure those open-backed, gold-plated, wired headphones sound amazing hooked up to an equally expensive amplifier, but the fatal flaw here is practicality. I don't just need my headphones to sound great, they should be usable where I need them.\nI'm sure there will be plenty of people recommending the best all-round headphones, and goodness knows we take a crack at finding the best headphones every year, but I think in my case it's a sisyphean task and a fool's errand all in one.\nThere Are Levels of Survival We\u2019re Willing to Accept\nSo at this point in my life I've settled into a sort of comfort zone where I'm OK with imperfect headphones at basically any reasonable price. Currently I use Samsung Buds 2 Pro, which are the best true wirless earbuds I have ever used in every category. They almost (but not quite) don't make me wish for full-sized phones when I use them.\nMy wired headphone needs are handled by a pair of Sony WH-1000XM4s, which are also my traveling over-ear headphones. I really love these overall, but to me, they do overemphasize bass a little and the pass-through could be better. My daily drivers are still the AirPods Max, which I wear all-day, every day during the week.\nThese are the headphones I have the least complaints about personally, except that they do not support wired, lossless audio. Since, even if you pay the egregious amount for a compatible cable, you are pushed through a lossy digital-to-analogue process and then again from analog-to-digital, rather than the one-time conversion you'd get with headphones that also have analog input support.\nPlaying Musical Chairs With My Headphones Is the Best I Can Do\nEach of the headphones I currently own has some piece of the puzzle that would add up to the last pair of practical daily all-purpose headphones I'd need, but as of today there's just no way of combining all of those positive attributes into a single product.\nSo, picking the right headphones or the right job is really the best I can do, but above all else, I needed to curb my pointless nitpicking of otherwise brilliant headphones to the detriment of my own enjoyment, and that's by far the hardest thing to do."

      "text": "Quick Links\nSummary\n- Speakers are convenient, and comfort is not a factor because you don't have to wear them.\n- A good surround sound speaker system can provide you with an experience that's almost as immersive as a good pair of headphones.\n- Speakers typically last longer than headphones because they get handled less.\nMany gamers feel obliged to use headphones to get the best possible experience. But what if I told you that you could get a quality gaming experience from speakers as well without having to sweat under those cans?\nComfort Is a Non-factor With Speakers\nWhile there are some very comfy headphones on the market, you'll always be able to feel their presence on your head. Even the lightest of headphones can't go unnoticed, and I often find that they sit too tight or too loose on my ears. As someone who wears glasses, I find that ear pads range from somewhat comfortable to unbearably painful.\nThe worst part about wearing an over-ear gaming headset is that your ears get sweaty, especially during prolonged gaming sessions on hot summer nights. Like in-ear headphones, gaming over-ear headphones trap bacteria in and around your ear, which can lead to painful ear infections. You also have to clean headphones regularly to maintain their hygiene.\nNow, compare that to speakers. You never come into physical contact with your speakers during regular use, so comfort is not a factor. They just sit on your desk or entertainment unit and get the job done. You never have to put them on and take them off. There are no tangled or frayed cables that break down further with each use. Other than the occasional dusting, you never have to clean them, either. Most importantly, speakers won't give you sweaty ears and \"headphone hair\" that headphones are known for.\nAlso, if you enjoy snacking while gaming, you might find yourself wrestling with your headset's microphone when trying to grab a bite. A standalone microphone with a nice stand combined with a pair of speakers offers superior sound quality and infinite comfort.\nI love the convenience that speakers provide. I can just sit down at my desk, turn a game on, and play without having to tether myself to the desk with a pair of headphones. I like to take frequent breaks from my desk, so I don't have to fuss around with headphones. Though wireless headphones might sound like a solution to many of these issues, they also come with a higher price tag, use lossy compression, and might not last as long.\nI Want to Hear What's Going On Around Me\nOne thing I never particularly liked about gaming with headphones is that they shut out the world around me. While that's a great trick for immersion, I'm not a fan of not being aware of my surroundings since it makes me feel uneasy.\nI live alone and get the occasional knock on the door from guests or my elderly neighbor, so it's vital that I don't miss it. Also, my cat might call me or stir up some trouble, and I want to make sure he gets the undivided attention he deserves. I'm sure that gamer parents can agree that being aware of your surroundings is far more important than immersing yourself completely in a Call of Duty: Warzone match.\nYou might say, \"just grab a pair of open-back headphones,\" but the issue persists to a large degree. My current gaming headset has an open-back design, and if I increase the volume by more than 50%, I lose the ability to hear my surroundings. It's much easier to crank up the volume on my speakers while still hearing what's happening in and around my house.\nGood Speakers Can Create an Immersive Experience\nGamers generally prefer headphones over speakers because of the higher level of immersion they provide, especially if they're spatial headphones that can reproduce authentic surround sound. Without a doubt, headphones are better at delivering an immersive experience than speakers; that's not the point I'm disputing.\nHowever, let's not rush to dismiss speakers for gaming just yet. A good 5.1 surround sound system can provide accurate spatial audio that won't make you feel like you're falling behind in multiplayer FPS games.\nAdditionally, no matter how hard speakers try to reproduce the growl of a bassy explosion, they simply can't match the depth provided by a real subwoofer. A large subwoofer can reproduce extremely low frequencies of around 20\u201330Hz without distorting them, resulting in desk-shaking vibrations when explosions go off. This effect immerses you (and your neighbors) in a game like nothing else.\nSpeakers Can Last a Lifetime\nSpeakers don't get handled much, so you're unlikely to damage them during regular use. You might be able to fry them by running them at above maximum volume for extended periods, but that's about it.\nOn the other hand, headphones have to sit on your head for hours on end, day after day. The constant exposure to the oils and sweat from your skin and scalp eventually wears down the headband and ear pads. Also, there's a good chance that you'll drop your headphones and break or damage them. I've dropped more pairs than I'd care to admit.\nI bought my Logitech Z333 speakers at the same time I bought my QPAD headphones (the same model as the original HyperX Cloud). They cost about the same, too. Four years later, the speakers look as good as new, whereas my headphones are slowly disintegrating. The headband is worn out, the plastic now has a sticky rubber coating, and the cables are starting to fail.\nIt's worth noting that an exceptionally high-quality pair of headphones might last a few years longer, but they're still subject to the same wear and tear caused by daily use.\nSpeakers Are Less Detrimental to Your Hearing\nIt's no secret that loud sounds are bad for your hearing, but did you know that you could suffer from permanent hearing damage in less than one hour of listening to music on loud headphones?\nI'm not suggesting that loudspeakers can't do similar damage, but speakers that sit a couple of feet away from your ears are inherently less dangerous than headphones that are strapped to your head. Sound waves coming from the speakers must travel through the air before reaching your ears, so they lose some of their energy.\nYou sometimes don't even realize that your headphone volume is too high until it's too late. You're focused on hearing enemy footsteps, so you crank it up, but one flashbang later, you're left with ringing ears. As one Redditor put it, you lose your frame of reference with headphones, making it hard to judge the loudness. In contrast, speakers make it easy to compare your volume level by relating it to environmental sounds.\nHeadphones and speakers each have their list of pros and cons; Give yourself the freedom of choice by owning both a quality set of speakers and headphones. Speakers throughout the day so that you can enjoy your games without losing out on your surroundings, and headphones at night to avoid disturbing your family and neighbors."

If you're only familiar with Bluetooth, you might be wondering what this dongle is even for\u2014there's a reason it exists. Let's go over the pros and cons of each.\nHow Is 2.4GHz Different From Bluetooth?\nLet's start by clarifying what 2.4GHz actually means in the context of computer peripherals. It refers to a type of proprietary wireless technology called USB-RF, where devices like mice and headsets use a small USB dongle to connect to your computer. Unlike Bluetooth, this 2.4GHz connectivity is specific to each manufacturer. In fact, some manufacturers, like Logitech, have multiple 2.4GHz \"standards\" with varying levels of compatibility, but we'll touch on that later.\nYou'll typically find 2.4GHz in gaming-focused peripherals as a way to provide a better and more responsive experience thanks to higher bandwidth and latency optimization. For instance, Bluetooth only supports a maximum polling rate of 125Hz (the mouse reports its position 125 times a second), which translates into a delay of 8ms. In contrast, many 2.4GHz devices support 1,000Hz, with some recent models, like the Razer BlackWidow V4 Pro, reaching over 4,000Hz.\nAlthough Bluetooth also operates on the 2.4GHz frequency spectrum, it prioritizes short-range low-power connectivity, resulting in significantly lower bandwidth and higher latency compared to proprietary 2.4GHz connections. An analysis by RTINGS paints a clear picture: 2.4GHz is both faster and more consistent than Bluetooth when all other factors are equal.\n2.4GHz Has One Massive Flaw\nWhile 2.4GHz is objectively better than Bluetooth in many ways, it has one glaring issue: it's all proprietary. Each manufacturer uses its own 2.4GHz technology, which only works with their devices. So, if you have a Logitech mouse, Razer keyboard, and SteelSeries headset, you'll need three separate 2.4GHz receivers to connect everything. And if you're using these devices with a laptop, you might not even have enough USB ports to connect everything at once.\nOkay, so what? If you don't mind limiting your selection, you can get everything from the same manufacturer. However, even then, there are caveats, such as compatibility issues between different dongles and peripherals.\nFor instance, if you want to use Logitech's gaming-oriented 2.4GHz Lightspeed connection, you can connect two Lightspeed devices to a single Lightspeed keyboard receiver. If you have a Lightspeed mouse and headset, you'll still have to use two separate Lightspeed receivers. Yet, somehow, Logitech has managed to complicate things even further. Older Logitech models use the 2.4GHz dongle or the Unifying Receiver, whereas newer models use Logi Bolt.\nMoreover, if you lose one of these proprietary 2.4GHz receivers or it stops working outside warranty, replacing it is quite expensive. Unlike Bluetooth dongles, you have to buy an original replacement dongle, and it often has to be the exact model that works with your device. For instance, the Logitech G502 X Lightspeed dongle currently costs $31.99 on Amazon. The Razer Blackshark V2 Pro headset receiver is even more expensive at $40.99.\nBluetooth Is Universal but Limited\nMost devices around us support Bluetooth, and for those that don't, you can easily add support with a cheap Bluetooth dongle. I use a $3 Bluetooth dongle on my PC, and it works flawlessly with my keyboard, earbuds, and Xbox controller. Provided you don't go over the bandwidth limit, you can use multiple devices simultaneously via Bluetooth; no dongles are required.\nIt's a simple, easy-to-use, and familiar interface. You can get a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard, which you can then use with your PC, laptop, phone, tablet, and TV without having to worry about dongles. Those of us who have forgotten a 2.4GHz dongle while on the go know the frustration of having a device but being unable to use it. On top of that, Bluetooth is more energy efficient than 2.4GHz, meaning you can easily go days or even weeks without charging your mouse or headphones.\nHowever, while Bluetooth is fine for most people, some of the time, it's not ideal. First, it suffers from higher latency, making it unsuitable for serious gaming. While I use Bluetooth for my controller and single-player games, I would never use it in competitive games like Marvel Rivals or first-person shooters.\nAdditionally, Bluetooth has around half the range, which can be problematic on wireless controllers or if you like walking around the house while chatting with friends on Discord using your wireless headset.\nSpeaking of headsets, Bluetooth suffers from worse audio quality compared to 2.4GHz due to the significantly lower bandwidth. While some Bluetooth codecs promise solid sound quality, they still pale in comparison to proprietary 2.4GHz technologies. This is compounded by the somewhat noticeable delay, which can spoil the experience in rhythm games. You can forget about playing Osu! or Piano Tiles via Bluetooth.\nWhich Wireless Technology Should You Use?\nFirstly, if your device comes with a 2.4GHz dongle, there's really no reason not to use it in favor of Bluetooth. It has better range, performance, and reliability, as it's less prone to signal dropouts and interference. If you're a gamer, forget about using Bluetooth. While it's fine for casual use with a wireless controller, 2.4GHz is simply the better option.\nHowever, if you just need something for the office, there's a good chance you won't even notice the difference between 2.4GHz and Bluetooth, especially when it comes to mice and keyboards. What you will notice is the improved battery life. For example, the Logitech Signature M550 promises a 2-year battery life on a single AA battery. For context, I have to charge my Logitech G502 Lightspeed every two weeks (though I also have RGB enabled).\nWhether you opt for Bluetooth or 2.4Ghz, you should know that it's a congested spectrum. Your Wi-Fi router, microwave, and smart home devices all use 2.4GHz. To get the best performance from your wireless devices, keep the dongle as close as possible and within line of sight.\nWhen Possible, Buy Devices That Support Both\nIf you want to get the superior performance of 2.4GHz but also need something that works universally with any Bluetooth-enabled device, look for peripherals that support both options. It's already common in wireless mechanical keyboards, but we're starting to see it in mice and headsets as well. That way, you'll always have an extra way to connect the device. Even if you lose the dongle, you can continue using it via Bluetooth in a pinch until a new dongle arrives."

      "text": "Quick Links\nYou don\u2019t need to spend over the odds on \u201cgaming\u201d branded products. If you\u2019re happy to forego the branding and RGB you\u2019ll save money, which means you can spend more on the things that matter (like GPUs and games).\nGaming Headsets\nThe cheapest gaming headsets are some of the worst things you can put on your head, and even the more expensive ones can fall short of the mark. The money you\u2019ll spend on a combined headphones-and-microphone unit could be better spent on a good pair of headphones and a separate USB mic.\nDollar-for-dollar, you\u2019ll get better audio quality all around. Not having a microphone clipped to your headphones also means you can wear them out of the house without feeling like you\u2019re in a Tom Clancy novel. If you appreciate the headset form factor, augment your standard headphones with something like the Antlion ModMic clip-on.\nAntlion Audio ModMic USB Attachable Noise-Cancelling Microphone with Mute Switch Compatible with Mac, Windows PC, Playstation 4, and More\nA small attachable microphone that turns any pair of headphones into a headset.\nTake a look at our picks for best headphones, best budget headphones, or even best noise canceling headphones. We\u2019ve also got a list of our favorite gaming microphones and top boom microphones too.\nConsole gamers may find that this isn\u2019t an option, so the headset route might be the best option. Even so, we wouldn\u2019t recommend spending too much. Both Sony and Microsoft\u2019s relatively inexpensive first-party headsets made it into our best gaming headset roundup for a reason.\nGaming Chairs\nGaming chairs have a certain aesthetic, and sometimes that\u2019s all they have going for them. They can be cheaply made, overpriced, and aren\u2019t built to last. Cheap foam compresses over time, and thin covers tear and stretch. They may seem comfortable when you sit in them on the show floor at PAX, but if you want the best bang for your buck you can\u2019t beat a good office chair.\nWe\u2019ve got a list of our favorite office chairs plus a shortlist of the best ergonomic office chairs, too. Not everyone can spring for a Herman Miller Aeron, but not everyone needs to. Since many of these models (Herman Miller chairs in particular) are made to last, you can find bargains if you know where to look.\nHerman Miller Aeron Chair\nIf you want to invest in a chair that'll last you a really long time and have your back thanking you at the end of every workday, spring for Herman Miller's Aeron chair.\nCheck out Facebook Marketplace and similar reseller websites, as well as any office \u201cclosing down\u201d sales to find some of the best lightly-used office furniture at bargain prices. Not only do premium office chairs look good, but they can help improve your posture.\nGaming Mice\nNot all gaming mice are expensive. Some of the best gaming mice are budget gaming mice since they offer comfort and \u201cgood enough\u201d performance in a relatively inexpensive package. But even if you\u2019re a keen gamer, you might not benefit from spending big on a pro-tier peripheral that lights up like a Christmas tree.\nGaming mice are good, but most people aren\u2019t good enough to need a gaming mouse. Don\u2019t get me wrong, you\u2019re probably great at games, but are you \u201cgetting paid to stream Fortnite\u201d good? If you don\u2019t have any energy drink sponsorships, you might want to spend your money on one of the best regular mice instead, like the Logitech MX Master 3S.\nLogitech MX Master 3S\nThe Logitech MX Master 3S takes a great mouse and makes it even better. Keeping the comfortable form factor that will fit the needs of every user, as long as they're not left-handed.\nThese have similarly high DPI so they\u2019re plenty sensitive enough for gaming needs, with additional buttons for switching between sensitivity modes or accessing shortcuts. You might even find a nice ergonomic mouse that preserves your wrist by day and still pwns noobs by night.\nGaming Keyboards\nThe line between gaming and enthusiast keyboards has blurred over the years. Mechanical keyboards are loved by gamers, coders, writers, and anyone who spends most of their day punishing their fingertips. But not all \u201cgaming\u201d keyboards are mechanical.\nMany of these keyboards use old-fashioned membranes and still cost more than the best budget mechanical keyboards. You might just be paying for a name brand, buckets of RGB lighting, and a few extra knobs and hotkeys around the edges.\nYou don\u2019t need to buy a \u201cgaming\u201d keyboard to get a decent typing experience. There are even quality non-mechanical keyboards to choose from. You should properly research mechanical keyboards before you buy so that you understand the difference between switch types, keycaps, and the options you have in terms of buying a ready-made model or building your own.\nYou might even decide your money is better spent on an ergonomic keyboard that uses an unusual shape or splits apart entirely in the middle.\nMicrosoft Ergonomic Keyboard\nFeaturing a split keyboard design, the Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard takes some getting used to, but will keep your wrists in a more natural position, reducing strain.\nGaming PC Cases\nPC cases come in all shapes and sizes. As long as your case fits your chosen form factor and components, you\u2019re halfway there. Other factors to keep in mind are airflow, inputs and outputs (I/O), and budget.\nYou don\u2019t need to spend massive amounts of money to get good I/O and satisfactory cooling. As long as the case has enough vents for the necessary intake and outtake fans, cooling shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Read our guide on picking the right PC case and then choose something that fits your budget.\nSome people like their PC case to be a conversation starter or a desk ornament, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. But if you\u2019re one of the many who choose to hide the case altogether under a desk or behind a monitor, you probably don\u2019t need to spend much more than $100. You might even have a case you can re-use from an old build.\nIf you\u2019re concerned about missing out on RGB lighting, consider adding some RGB fans (which cost marginally more than non-RGB variants) instead.\nPre-Built \u201cGaming\u201d PCs\nBuilding your own PC will save you money, but some would still rather buy a pre-built system. Sometimes you\u2019ll need to go through a system integrator that builds mostly gaming PCs to make this happen, but sometimes companies like Dell and HP are a good choice too.\nSometimes, the biggest difference between \u201cgaming\u201d brands like Dell\u2019s Alienware or HP\u2019s Omen and their performance brands is a fancy PC case and hardware downgrade. Take Dell\u2019s XPS line, as an example: comparably priced XPS models we looked at had slightly better processors and double the RAM and storage (with the same GPU) compared to Alienware models. They also come with Windows 11 Pro, instead of Home.\nThe devil\u2019s in the details in terms of whether these are always the better buys. You might find that stronger power supplies, better cooling, or faster storage and RAM tips the balance slightly. The plain old XPS box is the more boring option, but both models we compared had the same mouse and keyboard in the box.\nCustomizing these pre-built machines is also an option. If you find something you like but you want to swap out the GPU or add more storage, you can do this before you check out.\nGaming Routers\nHigh-performance routers have their place, but for most of us a good budget router will do the trick. Brands like Netgear and ASUS have mesh-like wireless access points that are aimed at gamers and make the rest of the pack look puny, but there are better ways of improving network performance.\nTP-Link Archer AX55\nAn upgraded version of the beloved AX50, the PT-Link AX55 offers a new Qualcomm chip to provide better stability and the addition of OneMesh and WPA3 support.\nIf you\u2019re serious about maxing out your network performance, getting a decent router that supports wired speeds of at least a gigabit is a good place to start (though 2.5Gb, 5Gb, and 10Gb are all options too). Now spend the additional money you would have spent on a maxed-out Wi-Fi model on Ethernet cable.\nIt\u2019s tricky to estimate the cost of an all-wired (or mostly-wired) network, since you may need to get a tradesperson to feed wires and plaster walls. That said, if you have easy access to roof cavities and some confidence in your abilities, you might be able to finish the job in an afternoon.\nIf you have a super-fast internet connection then it\u2019s important to make sure your Wi-Fi speed isn\u2019t limiting performance. For most, this won\u2019t be an issue if your router is only a couple of years old. If you have a large house or office and Wi-Fi dead zones are causing you grief, you might find the money spent on a \u201cgaming\u201d router is better spent on a good mesh Wi-Fi system instead.\nASUS ZenWiFi AX (XT8)\nIt's hard to go wrong with the ZenWiFi AX (XT8) if you want a solid mesh router to bring super-fast internet to every corner of your home.\nCables\nDon\u2019t fall for expensive HDMI cables, they\u2019re no better than the cheap ones. The best HDMI cables deliver the same digital signal and image quality, but you might find you pay more for tougher designs that will last longer (assuming you\u2019re often plugging and unplugging them). The cables that come with your PS5, Xbox Series X, or graphics card don\u2019t need replacing with \u201cbetter\u201d products.\nNot all Ethernet cables are equal, but you can choose the right network cable for the job based on your required speed, length, and whether or not you need shielding.\nCharging cables for smartphones and other USB devices are a bit different. You might find that some are very flimsy, so spending a bit more might be worth it. Ultimately, they all take abuse and will fail in the end. See our roundups of the best Lightning cables and best USB-C cables for some ideas.\nSpend Your Money Wisely\nSome things aren\u2019t worth skimping on. These include graphics cards, processors, RAM, storage devices, coolers, controllers, and displays. The more money you save on unnecessary \u201cgamer\u201d branding, the more you\u2019ll have left for the things that matter."

      "text": "Summary\n- Condenser mics are too sensitive and capture a lot of background noise.\n- Dynamic mics capture less noise and sound better in untreated rooms.\n- While condenser mics can work with the right setup, dynamic mics still sound better in gaming scenarios.\nIf you're a gamer who uses a standalone microphone instead of the one on your headset, you're already on track toward better sound quality than most. However, many \"gaming\" mics are of the condenser type, which might not be the best choice.\nWhy Condenser Microphones Aren't Ideal for Gamers\nCondenser microphones can sound excellent; that's not the issue. The real problem with condenser microphones is their high sensitivity, which means they capture every little detail. While this is desirable in a studio setting for recording vocals, instruments, or ASMR sounds, it's the exact opposite of what a gaming microphone needs to do.\nA gaming microphone's primary role is to clearly record your voice while minimizing unwanted sounds. Your teammates want to hear when your ultimate ability is ready for a counter-attack, not the flurry of keyboard clicks, creaking chairs, or your TV in the background.\nWhat Is a Condenser Microphone, and How Do They Work?\nCondenser mics offer more sensitivity for detailed recordings, but they're not the best tool for every job.\nA condenser's high sensitivity also brings in more background noise. It can capture sounds you're not even aware of, such as PC fans, breathing, and even your mouse sliding on your mousepad. On top of that, condensers have greater levels of self-noise, the inherent electrical noise generated by the microphone's internals. This noise can be further amplified by low-quality components in your motherboard or audio interface.\nThey also struggle with loud noises. Plosives (sound like \"b\" in \"bat\") and sudden loud noises, such as yelling when you get excited during a fast-paced match, cause condenser microphones to clip (cut out or distort). Side note: it's both funny and cringe-worthy when a teammate is flaming you, and their mic cuts in and out.\nStop Buying \u201cGaming\u201d Products (Buy These Instead)\nDon\u2019t assume it\u2019s better just because it says \u201cgaming\u201d on the box.\nGet a Dynamic Microphone Instead\nUnlike a condenser, a dynamic microphone is passive and doesn't need phantom power. It has less self-noise and is less sensitive. While you have to be close to a dynamic mic to sound good, it won't pick up nearly as much background noise. Most dynamic microphones use a cardioid pattern, which focuses on what's in front, capturing your voice while isolating background noise.\nSound quality is completely subjective when it comes to dynamic vs. condenser mics. Still, it's worth mentioning that dynamic microphones typically sound warmer and more natural, which some might find more pleasant compared to the bright, airy tone of a condenser.\nWhat isn't subjective, though, is that dynamic microphones sound better in untreated rooms. Since they're designed for live environments, they're preferred by podcasters, radio hosts, and interviewers prefer them. Gamers benefit from this, too, as a gaming setup shares a similar need for clear sound in less-than-ideal conditions. They're also more durable if that matters to you.\nWhat Is Phantom Power, and Does Your Microphone Need It?\nAnd do you need it to power your microphone?\nDynamic microphones don't need a pop filter that might obstruct your face or vision, as they can handle loud input well. Plosives won't cause clipping, and you can even yell into them. I've tested the Shure MV6 by screaming into it as loudly as possible, and it only slightly distorted the sound.\nShure MV7 podcast microphone\nIf you need something high-end for streaming or with both USB and XLR inputs, the Shure MV7 is worth a closer look.\nUnless your gaming PC is inside a sound chamber, a condenser mic won't sound as good as a dynamic one, even if it's twice as expensive. Put simply, dynamic mics offer the perfect plug-and-play experience.\nThe Best Gaming Microphones of 2024\nNeed a powerful microphone for gaming or livestreaming? Check out some of our favorites.\nPrice is another major factor that benefits dynamic mics. While both condenser and dynamic microphones come in various price ranges, dollar for dollar, you'll get more value from a dynamic mic. This is because dynamic mics are much cheaper to produce, on top of the aforementioned reasons.\nA Condenser Mic Can Still Work With the Right Setup\nWhile a dynamic microphone is the best option for most gamers, there are situations when a condenser mic might be better. For streamers who frequently leave their desk, a condenser mic is more suitable. If you're a streamer who has to move around for challenges and other real-life activities, a dynamic mic might struggle to capture you while you're walking around. Then again, you probably want a wireless lavalier microphone for that.\nIf you're already stuck with a condenser mic, you can fix some of its drawbacks. First, purchase a basic boom arm, shock mount, and pop filter, and turn on the cardioid or supercardioid pattern. The arm will allow you to fine-tune the position of the mic, as it will sound better if it's not too close to your mouth, and the shock mount and pop filter will reduce unwanted sounds caused by vibrations and plosives. If you want to go a step further, treat your room with acoustic panels.\nLastly, use a noise suppression tool if your microphone doesn't have its own software. Discord allows you to use Krisp for free, and if you have an NVIDIA RTX GPU, you can use NVIDIA RTX Voice. These tools are handy with dynamic microphones as well, as they will isolate a human voice from any audio source. Just bear in mind that the better the source audio, the better the results the AI will get.\nCondenser microphones can sound amazing, but they require a good setup and are overkill for voice chat. If you'd prefer a hassle-free setup and something that works really well for gaming and calls, get a dynamic mic instead. You won't regret it. As a matter of fact, you won't regret buying any type of standalone mic over a headset."

      "url": "https://www.howtogeek.com/open-back-vs-closed-back-headphones-difference/",
      "text": "Summary\n- Closed-back headphones offer passive noise isolation, less sound leakage, and punchier bass than open-back designs.\n- Open-back headphones provide a wide soundstage for a natural, airy sound, but they leak a lot of sound.\n- Closed-back headphones are ideal for noisy environments, while open-back headphones are ideal for home use.\nWhen shopping for a new pair of headphones, one of the most important choices you'll make is whether to go with an open-back or closed-back design. This key difference greatly affects how your headphones sound and feel. So, which type is right for you?\nWhat Are Closed-Back Headphones?\nClosed-back headphones have a completely closed design on the back (outer) side of the earcups (housing). You can recognize them immediately because, unlike the perforated design of open-back headphones, these headphones are fully enclosed.\nAir (and sound) can\u2019t pass through the sealed outer shell of these earcups, effectively trapping the sound inside. Closed-back designs are common in over-ear headphones and are almost standard in on-ear and in-ear styles.\nSome examples of closed-back headphones include the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x, Sony WH-1000XM5, HIFIMAN SUNDARA, and the majority of gaming headsets, like my SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless.\nSteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless Gaming Headset\nThe SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless Gaming Headset is a high-end headset for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox gamers. It's a feature-packed product that comes with an unlimited dual-battery system and a 2.4GHz receiver with an OLED screen, numerous EQ presets for different games, and Bluetooth connectivity that can be used simultaneously with the 2.4GHz receiver.\nThe benefit of this closed design is the passive noise isolation it provides, allowing you to shut out the outside world completely. It also leaks less sound outside the earcups, so it won't bother people near you. Note that passive noise isolation is different from active noise cancellation (ANC).\nWhile not a strict rule, closed-back designs are often paired with leather or synthetic leather earpads, as these materials offer better sound isolation than something like velour. A notable exception is the Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO headphones, which famously use velour earpads for improved all-day comfort and a premium feel.\nBeyerdynamic DT 770 PRO Headphones\nThis affordable pair of studio headphones promises a neutral sound to pick up any odd glitches in the audio while mixing tracks and studio monitoring.\nIn terms of sound, a major benefit of the closed-back design is that it can deliver significantly punchier bass. The interior of the earcups effectively forms an acoustic chamber that helps enhance lower frequencies.\nClosed-back headphones are well-suited for most environments and use cases, especially when you're surrounded by others. Whether you need headphones for music or gaming at your desk, for DJing and live performances, during your daily commute, or in the office, they're an excellent choice if you love to fully immerse yourself in the music, movie, or video game you're enjoying.\nWhat Are Open-Back Headphones?\nOpen-back headphones feature a design where the earcups are not sealed on the outside. Instead, they use a perforated or mesh outer shell that allows air and sound to move freely between your ears and your surroundings. Think of them like having a pair of speakers positioned just a few inches from your head.\nSome examples of open-back headphones are the Philips SHP9600, Sennheiser HD 600, beyerdynamic DT 990 PRO, and my Sennheiser HD 599, which are some of the best entry-level audiophile headphones on the market.\nSennheiser HD 599 SE\nThe Sennheiser HD 599 SE are premium open-back headphones. Their spacious soundstage and balanced sound profile, combined with a solid and comfortable build, make them ideal for hours of uninterrupted and enjoyable music listening.\nIf you're into gaming headsets, your options will be limited, but there are a few open-back units, like the Audio-Technica ATH-GDL3WH and Drop + EPOS PC38X. On-ear open-back headphones are an anomaly, but they do exist, with the Grado SR60x being a good example. Earbuds can be semi-open if they have vent holes, like the standard Apple AirPods, or feature a specialized open design like the SHOKZ New OpenFit 2.\nThe benefit of the open-back headphones lies in their wide soundstage. They deliver a more natural, almost \"airy\" sound quality.\nUnlike closed-back headphones, which create a more enclosed sound in your head, open-back headphones produce a sound that's closer to a live performance. Open-back headphones are often paired with soft, breathable earpads like velour and cloth, which further enhance their open sound signature.\nDue to their natural and accurate sound, open-back headphones are often used by professional musicians in studios. They're also ideal for movies, gaming, and focused music listening. You can distinctly hear instruments like bass and drums coming from the front, with guitars and synths coming from the sides, thanks to the \"sound panning\" that's done during the mixing stage of a song.\nThe only caveat is that open-back headphones leak a lot of sound. Remember my speaker-strapped-to-head analogy? That's exactly how they sound\u2014not just to you, but to everyone around you. You'll hear them more loudly because the drivers are right next to your ears, but they'll also be loud to those nearby.\nWhile you could technically wear open-back headphones in public, I wouldn't recommend it. The sound leakage can bother those around you during your commute or at the office, and you won't be able to block out outside noise either.\nAnother characteristic/potential drawback of open-back headphones is that they can't deliver a growly, deep bass. Bass requires air movement to create a \"rumbling\" sensation, but since sound can escape freely through the back and earpads, the bass is often weaker. I personally enjoy this more accurate, less overwhelming bass sound, but it's not for everyone.\nShould You Get Open- Or Closed-Back Headphones?\nWhile the sound characteristics of each headphone type are important, your decision should be based on how you intend to use them. If you need sophisticated, well-balanced headphones for a variety of applications in your home or private office, open-back headphones are an excellent choice (ideally a wired model).\nTheir balanced sound ensures comfort for extended listening sessions, as the bass and overall sound pressure won\u2019t cause fatigue.\nInterestingly, while most gaming headsets are closed-back, I find that open-back headphones can offer more accurate spatial sound, which can help you detect footsteps. That said, the difference is marginal, so don't purchase open-back headphones if that's your only reason.\nDon\u2019t Buy a Gaming Headset, Buy Headphones and a Mic\nWhile gaming headsets undoubtedly make you look good, they don't always sound good.\nIf you travel frequently, work in a noisy environment, or simply need headphones that block outside noise, a closed-back unit is a better fit. They won't leak sound, so you won\u2019t disturb those around you, making them ideal for use in public or shared spaces. Depending on your preferences, you can choose between wired or wireless, with or without ANC. Plus, if you're a bass head, closed-back headphones are a much better option.\nBoth open- and closed-back headphones have their own set of strengths and drawbacks. Open-back headphones deliver a more natural, expansive sound but come with the downside of significant sound leakage. Closed-back headphones excel in providing sound isolation, making them ideal for public spaces, but they may not offer the same level of audio clarity or openness as their open-back counterparts.\nI highly recommend testing both types before committing to a purchase, whether in a store or through a friend's headphones. Even better, consider investing in both types. I constantly switch between my open-back, closed-back, and in-ear headphones, as each offers a completely unique listening experience. Having even five pairs of headphones isn't excessive if each one serves a different purpose."

      "text": "Answer: There are two primary types of over-ear headphones: open-back and closed-back. There is also a third type, semi-open, which attempts to combine the advantages of each. But for this discussion, we will focus on the open-back and closed-back types.\nClosed-Back Headphones\nClosed-back models are very common and are suitable for almost any situation. Some particular advantages of closed-back models are as follows:\n- Good to excellent isolation. A closed-back design reduces or eliminates outside noise from reaching the user. The result is a quiet listening environment that allows the user to hear even very low-level details in the source material. Many studio monitor headphones, which are required to have a high degree of accuracy, are closed-back types. An example of such a headphone is our popular ATH-M50x.\n- Low leakage. Leakage is a term used to describe of the extent to which audio leaks from the headphones. Low leakage is important in situations like recording where the leakage of a signal from a wearer\u2019s headphones could be picked up by the recording microphones. Low leakage would also be important if you are concerned about disturbing others around you.\n- Enhanced low-frequency (bass) reproduction. Much like the cabinet for a loudspeaker, the enclosed earcup of a closed-back headphone can be tuned to provide a specific result. The properties of a driver combined with the air volume of the cup can work together, for example, to extend low-frequency response or boost a particular range of frequencies. An example of this is our Solid Bass\u00ae line of headphones, which use a Double Air Chamber System and sophisticated drivers to provide high-quality, low-frequency reproduction.\nOpen-Back Headphones\nOpen-back models are becoming more popular as they can provide a more natural sound with increased soundstage width and depth. This benefit can be fully realized when listening to recordings of large ensembles, such as a choir, theatrical group or orchestra. Many video gamers prefer open-back type headsets for the same reasons. Some particular advantages of open-back models are as follows:\n- The open-back architecture of the earcup promotes a more natural sound due to less coloration than an enclosed earcup can create. This is largely due to the minimization of standing waves and reflections.\n- Better transient response (how quickly a driver can react to changes in the source material). Due to less air pressure against the rear of the driver, the driver can react more quickly to changes in the signal. This improves accuracy and insures that even the finest low-level sounds are heard clearly.\n- Lighter weight. Less earcup material translates to an overall lighter weight assembly. This can be beneficial when the user is wearing headphones for long periods of time, such as when mastering or gaming. A good example of a mastering headphone is our TEC Award-winning ATH-R70x. Check out our lightweight ATH-PDG1 Premium Gaming Headset for those marathon gaming sessions.\nWe hope this cleared up the differences between open-back and closed-back headphones. But, as always, if you have additional questions or need assistance with A-T products, please contact our Audio Solutions Department."

      "text": "Summary\n- Audiophile headphones prioritize sound quality over other features like ANC or wireless connectivity.\n- High-quality headphones can be a long-lasting investment worth the initial cost for years of superior sound.\n- Audiophile headphones open the door to audio customization with external DAC/AMP devices and customization options.\nIf you're a fan of music but never tried a high-quality pair of headphones, you're missing out. Audiophile headphones built for Hi-Fi audio enthusiasts are a gateway that can completely transform the way you listen to and appreciate sound. Here are a few reasons why you should get a pair.\nSound as an Experience\nBefore we can talk about audiophile headphones, let's first define what they are. You can describe any pair of headphones as \"audiophile headphones\" as long as they prioritize sound quality over other features, such as ANC (Active Noise Cancellation), wireless connectivity, and even build quality in extreme cases.\nThis doesn't mean that audiophile-grade headphones can't have those features\u2014the Sennheiser Momentum, for example, can do it all\u2014it's just that the priority clearly lies in sound quality. They're also different from studio (reference) headphones, which are engineered to have a very flat and accurate frequency response curve that isn't particularly enjoyable for music, movies, and games.\nSennheiser Momentum 4\nThe Sennheiser Momentum 4 bring some major upgrades to the line, including 60-hour battery life you can actually use and a charging case.\nAudiophile headphones have a unique frequency response curve that's responsible for a model's signature sound. Some models have a full, punchy bass, while others emphasize brightness and detail in treble, enhancing the clarity of vocals and guitar solos. Since listening is a subjective experience, you can pick a pair of audiophile headphones based on your personal preference.\nAudiophile headphones are a real treat to use. Regardless of which pair you pick up, as long as they're held in high regard by the audiophile community, you're guaranteed to have a great time using them. They'll allow you to hear all the intricate details in the sound, from the subtle breath between rap verses to the quick vibratos and pinch harmonics in heavy guitar riffs. I got the Sennheiser HD 599 SE last week, and I'm starting to hear details in my favorite songs that I had never noticed before.\nThe clarity, precision, and depth of sound on audiophile headphones are unlike anything else. Nothing beats the endorphin rush you get from listening to your favorite song on a good pair of headphones for the first time.\nHeadphones Can Be a Long-Lasting Investment\nWe tend to think of headphones as just another consumer electronic in our arsenal that needs to be replaced every 3\u20135 years because something better has come out. While this might be true for your computer, mouse, keyboard, and monitor, it doesn't necessarily apply to audio equipment.\nThough there are technological advancements, they tend to be much slower, especially when it comes to drivers and sound quality. High-quality headphones that sounded good twenty years ago will still sound good today.\nFor instance, the Sennheiser HD 650 has been around since 2003, with only a few minor revisions over the years. Other models evolved over time but still retained the same overall sound quality and design. The Audio-Technica ATH-M50s debuted in 2007, were revised as the M50x in 2014, received Bluetooth in 2018 (M50xBT), and saw yet another update in 2021 with the M50xBT2. Even if you have the originals from 2007, you're not missing out on audio quality\u2014just the added features like detachable cables and Bluetooth.\nAudio-Technica ATH-M50X Wired Headphones\nThe famous Audio-Technica ATH M50X headphones are beloved for their pro-level sound quality and relatively low price. And more notably, they have a detachable cable and several replaceable parts, so they last for a very long time.\nOnce you have a sturdy pair of audiophile headphones, take care of them, and they'll take care of your audio needs in return. Even if they're $500 cans, you'll get your money's worth as long as you don't drop them one too many times. All you need to do is replace the ear pads and possibly the headband once they break down, and you'll be good for another 3\u20135 years. Say goodbye to frequent upgrades and hello to your headphone collection addiction.\nComfort, Customization, and Scalability\nOnce you have a pair of audiophile headphones, you'll have opened the door to a world of audio customization. One of the first devices you might want to get to further improve and shape your sound is an external DAC/AMP combo device, such as the iFi Zen DAC V3 or Topping DX3pro+.\nThese amplifiers and DACs are external audio devices that can enhance the sound quality and clarity of your headphones, especially at higher volumes. Depending on the model you get, you can also get additional sound profiles for gaming and music or an equalizer. Amps are actually essential for driving high-impedance headphones, so don't get a high-impedance pair without also ordering an amp.\nIn addition to external devices, you also have more options for customization with popular audiophile headphones. This ranges from custom, well-padded ear pads and headbands from brands that cater to audiophiles, like Wicked Cushions and Brainwavz to advanced mods that involve taking your headphones apart and soldering.\nWhile the idea of collecting multiple quality headphones and external audio devices can be tempting, you don't really need to go down that road to enjoy superior sound. Simply invest in a good pair of headphones from a reputable brand that still fits your budget, and you'll be amazed."

  "argos_summary": "Gaming headsets are often overpriced and deliver poorer sound quality than audiophile headphones, especially because they use closed\u2011back designs that limit spatial audio and transient response. Open\u2011back audiophile headphones provide a wider, more natural soundstage and sharper footstep detection, making them superior for competitive shooters and immersive single\u2011player games, though they leak sound and are wired. Pairing a high\u2011quality standalone mic (dynamic rather than condenser) with audiophile headphones yields better voice clarity and longevity than built\u2011in headset mics. While speakers can offer immersion without leakage, the best overall experience comes from choosing the right headphone type for your environment and investing in durable, well\u2011built models that last years.}",
