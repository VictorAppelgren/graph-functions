  "title": "Trump and Putin\u2019s relationship turns sour as president pushes for resolution with Ukraine",
  "description": "President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin's once-friendly relationship has unraveled amid ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.",
  "content": "While President Donald Trump previously refrained from speaking ill of Russian President Vladimir Putin, those days are over.\n\nThe ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has changed the nature of their dynamic. Although the two appeared to get along, at least publicly, during Trump\u2019s first administration, their relationship has unraveled as the more recent conflict persists.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has refused to mince his words when asked about Putin. Trump said during a Cabinet meeting July 8 he was fed up with Putin and said he was eyeing potentially imposing new sanctions on Russia.\n\n\"We get a lot of bulls--- thrown at us by Putin, if you want to know the truth,\" Trump said. \"He's very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.\"\n\nJohn Hardie, Russia program deputy director at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said Russia started to attract ire from Trump dating back to March after Ukraine agreed to a 30-day ceasefire. But Russia has failed to get on board with a ceasefire.\n\n\"Really, since then, I think Trump has come to view the Russians as the main impediment to a deal,\" Hardie told Fox News Digital Thursday.\n\nAdditionally, Hardie said that Trump has also grown frustrated that Russia will launch drone and missile attacks against Ukraine, even after directly speaking with Putin.\n\n\"What he's sort of latched on to are these Russian drone and missile barrages,\" Hardie said. \"That really seems to resonate with him.\"\n\nTensions only have continued to escalate between the U.S. and Russia since the July Cabinet meeting.\n\nTrump announced July 14 that he would sign off on \"severe tariffs\" against Russia if Moscow failed to agree to a peace deal within 50 days. He then dramatically reduced the deadline to only 10\u201312 days \u2014 which ends Friday.\n\nThe decision to reduce the timeline prompted former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to caution that \"each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war.\"\n\nTRUMP LIFTS VEIL ON US SUBMARINES IN WARNING SHOT TO KREMLIN IN \u2018CLEVER\u2019 REPOSITIONING MOVE\n\nIn addition to economic sanctions, Trump responded to Medvedev and issued a rare statement disclosing that two U.S. Navy submarines would be moved in response to escalating threats from Russia.\n\n\"I have ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that,\" Trump said Aug. 1.\n\nTrump's disclosure of the submarine presence puts additional pressure on Russia to come to the negotiating table, according to Bryan Clark, a retired submarine officer and director of the Hudson Institute think tank\u2019s Center for Defense Concepts and Technology.\n\n\"We have used very sparingly submarines to try to influence adversary behavior before, but this is pretty unusual, to do it against a nuclear-powered adversary like Russia in response to a nuclear threat by Russia,\" Clark told Fox News Digital Monday. \"So I think this is trying to essentially push back on Russia's frequent and long-standing threats to use nuclear weapons in part of the Ukraine conflict.\"\n\nMomentum is picking up on negotiations though, and U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff met with Putin Wednesday.\n\nTrump said in a post on Truth Social afterward that \"great progress\" was made during the meeting. And now, Trump and Putin are expected to meet face to face imminently in an attempt to finally advance negotiations to end the war between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nStill, Hardie said he is skeptical that the meeting between Putin and Trump will result in meaningful progress.\n\n\"I don't expect a summit to produce much,\" Hardie said. \"And I think Putin could try to use the summit to placate Trump and kind of buy more time continues assault on Ukraine, but I think his goal is he'd love to be able to enlist Trump in his effort to impose these harsh terms on Ukraine.\"\n\nRussia has pushed for concessions in a peace deal that include barring Ukraine from joining NATO, preventing foreign peacekeeper troops from deploying to Ukraine after the conflict, and adjusting some of the borders that previously were Ukraine's.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if Trump plans to announce any additional economic burdens upon Russia Friday in accordance with the deadline that he imposed demanding that Russia signal willingness to end the conflict. But according to Trump, the ball is in Putin\u2019s court.\n\n\"It\u2019s going to be up to him,\" Trump told reporters Thursday. \"We\u2019re going to see what he has to say. It\u2019s going to be up to him. Very disappointed.\"\n\nThe White House did not disclose any details regarding potential Friday sanctions, but said that Trump wants to meet with Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Putin to resolve the conflict.\n\n\"The Russians expressed their desire to meet with President Trump, and the President is open to this meeting,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"President Trump would like to meet with both President Putin and President Zelensky because he wants this brutal war to end. The White House is working through the details of these potential meetings and details will be provided at the appropriate time.\"",

      "text": "President Donald Trump unveiled plans Friday to reposition two nuclear submarines as he and Russia\u2019s former president sparred over Trump\u2019s increased pressure on Moscow to end the war with Ukraine.\nAfter Trump announced a new deadline for Russia to end the conflict with Ukraine in early August, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said on Monday that the announcement is an additional \"step towards war.\"\n\"Based on the highly provocative statements of the Former President of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev, who is now the Deputy Chairman of the Security Council of the Russian Federation, I have ordered two Nuclear Submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social Friday.\nMEDVEDEV WARNS THAT TRUMP'S NEW DEADLINE TO END RUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICT IS A \u2018STEP TOWARDS WAR\u2019\nThe announcement comes just weeks after Trump praised the contributions of a guided-missile submarine involved in the strikes against Iran, which launched more than two dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles at key Iranian targets, officials said.\n\"By the way, if anyone thinks our \u2018hardware\u2019 was great over the weekend, far and away the strongest and best equipment we have, 20 years advanced over the pack, is our Nuclear Submarines,\" Trump said June 23 in a Truth Social post. \"They are the most powerful and lethal weapons ever built, and just launched the 30 Tomahawks \u2014 All 30 hit their mark perfectly. So, in addition to our Great Fighter Pilots, thank you to the Captain and Crew!\"\nThe mission, which targeted Iranian nuclear facilities Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan, also involved more than 125 U.S. aircraft, including B-2 stealth bombers, according to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine.\nTRUMP ATTACKS IRAN NUCLEAR SITES: ARE OUR TROOPS IN DANGER FROM RETALIATORY STRIKES?\nCaine did not disclose the name of the submarine that was involved in the Iran strikes. However, he said that a \"guided-missile submarine\" was involved.\nFour of the U.S. Navy\u2019s Ohio-class submarines were converted into guided-missile submarines to accommodate conventional land attacks, as well as Special Operations Forces platforms. These submarines are the Ohio, Florida, Michigan and Georgia, according to the U.S. Navy.\nAll U.S. Navy submarines are nuclear-powered, and Trump did not disclose additional details surrounding the submarines that would be repositioned amid increased tension with Russia. It is incredibly rare for defense officials to comment or reveal the locations of submarines, given the highly classified nature of their deployments and movements.\nTrump initially announced on July 14 that he would sign off on \"severe tariffs\" against Russia if Moscow were to fail to agree to a peace deal within 50 days. However, Trump said Monday that waiting that period of time was pointless as negotiations have continued to drag on for months.\n\"I\u2019m going to make a new deadline, of about 10 \u2014 10 or 12 days from today,\" Trump told reporters in Scotland Monday. \"There\u2019s no reason for waiting. It was 50 days. I wanted to be generous, but we just don\u2019t see any progress being made.\"\nIn response, Medvedev, now the deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia, accused Trump of playing the \"ultimatum game.\"\n\"Trump's playing the ultimatum game with Russia: 50 days or 10 \u2026 He should remember 2 things: 1. Russia isn't Israel or even Iran. 2. Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war. Not between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country,\" Medvedev said in a post on X on Monday.\nTrump\u2019s new deadline comes amid heightened frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin amid stalled progress toward peace between Russia and Ukraine, and just days after Russia launched more than 300 drones, four cruise missiles and three ballistic missiles into Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian air force."

      "text": "Key facts about President Donald Trump: What to know\nDonald Trump served as the 45th President of the United States and was re-elected in 2024 to become the 47th President. He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022. Trump married Marla Maples in 1993, and they have one daughter, Tiffany Trump.\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest child of President Trump, has five children: Kai Trump, Donald J. Trump III, Tristan Trump, Spencer Trump, and Chloe Trump. Eric Trump is married to Lara Trump, who currently hosts FOX News Channel's \"My View with Lara Trump.\" Eric and Lara have two children, Eric Luke Trump and Carolina Trump. Ivanka Trump is married to Jared Kushner, and they have three children: Arabella Kushner, Joseph Kushner, and Theodore Kushner. Tiffany Trump welcomed her first child, Alexander Boulos, in 2025 with her husband, Michael Boulos."

      "text": "President Donald Trump took a different tone on Russian leader Vladimir Putin during his Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, calling out the \"bull----.\"\nTrump was making a contrast between the assistance his administration sent Ukraine during his first term and what former President Barack Obama approved.\n\"I gave them the javelins. Remember? They said, \u2018Trump gave the javelins and Obama gave them sheets.\u2019 Right. They called Obama at that time, Barack Hussein Obama. If you haven't heard, he did a terrible job,\" Trump said. \"That was a war that should have happened. And a lot of people are dying and it should end. And I don't know, we get\u2026 we get a lot of bull---- thrown at us by Putin. If you want to know the truth. He's very nice all the time, but it turns out to be meaningless.\"\nWhen Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, Obama rejected Ukraine's request for lethal aid and instead sent non-lethal military assistance, including items like blankets, night vision devices and medical supplies. In December 2017, Trump marked a shift in U.S. policy toward Ukraine by approving the sale of Javelin missiles and launch units.\nNATO JETS SCRAMBLED AMID RUSSIA'S LARGEST DRONE ATTACK ON UKRAINE\nTrump on Tuesday said the Biden administration's botched withdrawal from Afghanistan gave Putin the green light to launch his full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\"I think that had you not had the situation in Afghanistan, I don't think Putin would have gotten in. I think when he looked at how stupid and incompetent that operation was, he said, \u2018wow, this might be a chance',\" Trump told reporters. \"We're dealing with him now, too. We're not happy with Putin. I'm not happy with Putin, I can tell you that much right now, because he's killing a lot of people, and a lot of them are his soldiers, his soldiers and their soldiers, mostly. And it's now up to 7,000 a week. And I'm not happy with Putin.\"\nLast week, Trump said he was \"very disappointed\" by his phone call with Putin, who afterward refused to back down from his objectives and launched the largest aerial assault on Ukraine since the war began. Trump, meanwhile, reported having a \"very strategic call\" with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as the United States weighed whether to sell Kyiv more Patriot missiles.\nSince beginning his second term, Trump has expressed having a \"good relationship\" with Putin. As the U.S. attempted to negotiate a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine, Trump reported having a \"lengthy and very productive\" call with Putin in March. Meanwhile, a meeting in the Oval Office with Zelenskyy grew increasingly contentious as Trump and Vice President JD Vance accused the Ukrainian leader of being ungrateful for U.S. support and of resisting a peace deal.\n\"You're gambling with World War III, and what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that's backed you far more than a lot of people say they should have,\" Trump told Zelenskyy in February.\nZELENSKYY TOUTS 'FRUITFUL' TRUMP CALL AFTER US PRESIDENT WAS 'DISAPPOINTED' BY PUTIN TALK\nTrump and Zelenskyy met at The Hague during the NATO summit last month, and afterward the U.S. president said of Zelenskyy, \"he couldn\u2019t have been nicer,\" while expressing a mutual desire to see an end to the three-year-long conflict.\nDuring his Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Trump criticized the scale of the U.S. military aid sent to Ukraine under former President Joe Biden, while also praising \"brave\" Ukrainian fighters.\n\"I will say the Ukrainians were brave, but we gave them the best equipment ever made,\" Trump said. Without it, the president said, the conflict, \"probably would have been a very quick war, would have been a war that lasted 3 or 4 days.\"\n\"But they had the benefit of unbelievable equipment and Europe gave them too. We gave them far more because \u2013 Biden shouldn't have done that. He should have equalized,\" Trump said. \"We should have given them the same or we should have given actually less than Europe because it affects Europe much more than us. But we're in there for over $300 billion. Europe's in there for over 100 billion, but still Europe gave a lot.\"\n\"And I will say this. The Ukrainians, whether you think it's unfair that we gave all that money or not, they were very brave because somebody had to operate that stuff,\" Trump added. \"And a lot of people I know wouldn't be operating it. They wouldn't have the courage to do it. So they fought very bravely, but we gave them the best equipment in the world. We make the best military equipment by far. There's nobody close.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe Pentagon paused U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine in June out of concern for U.S. stockpiles of critical munitions, including Patriot missiles, amid the Israel-Iran conflict.\nTrump said Tuesday some U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine have resumed.\n\"We wanted to put defensive weapons because Putin is not, he's not treating human beings right. He's killing too many people. So we're sending some defensive weapons to Ukraine, and I've approved that,\" Trump said."

      "text": "President Donald Trump recently broke with decades of strategic silence when he publicly revealed the repositioning of U.S. nuclear-powered submarines in a thinly veiled warning to Russia.\nThe announcement \u2014 targeted at Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman and former President Dmitry Medvedev after his latest nuclear threats \u2014 sent shockwaves through the defense world not just for its provocation, but for the sheer fact that it was said out loud.\nPresidents have long moved military assets like aircraft carriers and bombers to signal resolve. But submarines, especially the covert, nuclear-powered kind, are rarely mentioned.\n\"We rarely, if ever, talk about submarine movements unless there\u2019s been an undeniable accident,\" Gene Moran, a former Navy captain and Pentagon strategic advisor, told Fox News Digital.\nPlenty of other military assets \u2014 Patriot batteries, aircraft carriers, even B-52 bombers \u2014 are deployed publicly to send a diplomatic message. But this time, the secretive nature of the nuclear submarine positioning may have been the reason for the choice.\n\"Submarine deployments are unverifiable,\" said Moran. \"That\u2019s what gives them strategic value, but also what makes this announcement clever \u2014 if you're aiming for a headline.\"\nTRUMP CONFIRMS 2 NUCLEAR SUBMARINES ARE 'IN THE REGION' TO COUNTER RUSSIA\nVice Admiral Mike Connor, former commander of U.S. submarine forces, said Trump\u2019s statement may have sounded bold, but was in fact consistent with long-standing doctrine.\n\"He didn\u2019t really give away too much,\" Connor, who now serves as CEO of maritime tech company ThayerMahan, told Fox News Digital. \"It\u2019s generally understood, by our potential adversaries, that our submarines are out there, have been out there for 60-plus years, and are able to strike pretty much where they want, when they want, if needed.\"\n\"It\u2019s a more gentle message done this way,\" Connor added. \"It\u2019s not really in your face. It\u2019s just a reminder of what already exists.\"\nThe president was vague in revealing his plans, only announcing that nuclear submarines would be positioned in the \"appropriate regions\" following Medvedev\u2019s accusations that he was escalating the war. Trump told reporters Sunday the submarines are \"already in the region, where they should be.\"\nMoran said Trump may have simply aligned a routine rotation with a strategic message.\n\"It doesn\u2019t cost anything,\" he said. \"But if you do it repeatedly, it begins to reveal where your thresholds are. That has long-term consequences.\"\nHe also cast doubt on the depth of coordination behind the announcement, saying \"Submarines don\u2019t just move at the snap of a finger.\"\nMatthew Shoemaker, a former defense intelligence official, echoed that point.\n\"It\u2019s certainly unusual to announce it from an operational perspective,\" he said, \"which means this is primarily about sending a message to the Russians rather than trying to achieve a military goal.\"\nTRUMP REPOSITIONS 2 NUCLEAR SUBMARINES AFTER 'HIGHLY PROVOCATIVE' RUSSIAN COMMENTS\nMeanwhile, Trump's frustration with Putin has grown in recent weeks amid stalled negotiations to end the war, prompting him to scale back the deadline for Russia to agree to a peace deal.\nTrump's disclosure of the submarine presence puts additional pressure on Russia to come to the negotiating table, according to Bryan Clark, a retired submarine officer and director of the Hudson Institute think tank\u2019s Center for Defense Concepts and Technology.\n\"We have used very sparingly submarines to try to influence adversary behavior before, but this is pretty unusual, to do it against a nuclear-powered adversary like Russia in response to a nuclear threat by Russia,\" Clark told Fox News Digital Monday. \"So I think this is trying to essentially push back on Russia's frequent and long-standing threats to use nuclear weapons in part of the Ukraine conflict.\"\nMark Cancian, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, believes it\u2019s more likely that two already-deployed U.S. submarines were repositioned rather than any new vessels dispatched.\n\"At any one time there are about a dozen U.S. submarines deployed,\" he said. \"We probably just moved two of them to different spots. There hasn\u2019t been any report of new submarine sailings \u2014 you\u2019d have heard about that.\"\nRetired Navy Capt. Todd Sawhill, who served as a targeting expert with the Joint Staff and U.S. Central Command, said there\u2019s precedent for moving submarines in response to tensions \u2014 but rarely is it spoken of this openly.\n\"It is atypical to have a sitting president telegraph it so plainly,\" Sawhill said. \"It\u2019s consistent with Trump\u2019s desire to direct-message, so in that sense it\u2019s not surprising. But it\u2019s not how these things are usually done.\"\nExperts agree that once a U.S. submarine leaves port, it becomes difficult \u2014 though not impossible \u2014 for adversaries to track.\n\"These are very tightly controlled pieces of information,\" Cancian said. \"The U.S. has good confidence that deployed submarines aren\u2019t being followed \u2014 though we\u2019ve been wrong before.\"\nShoemaker noted that geography plays a significant role. \"The closer one gets to an adversary\u2019s shores, the more likely they can find and track our subs,\" he said. \"So it depends on where exactly these subs are sent near Russia.\"\nMoran added that both sides exaggerate their tracking capabilities.\n\"It\u2019s easy to claim you know where your adversary is,\" he said. \"But with modern submarines, that\u2019s a very difficult task.\"\nConnor also pointed to a recent case that underscored the low-profile potency of submarines.\n\"A few weeks ago, there was a strike on Iranian nuclear weapon component manufacturing sites,\" he said. \"There was a lot of noise about the fact that some Air Force planes flew from the U.S. and struck two deeply buried targets. And it was more or less a side note that a submarine \u2014 who knows which one or where it was \u2014struck 30 targets at the same time.\"\n\"It\u2019s a capability that\u2019s always there, not often used and doesn\u2019t need to be talked about too overtly to be effective.\"\nBut unlike the Iran strikes, it appears improbable that the submarines dispatched in response to increased tension with Russia would see the same kind of action, according to Clark.\nThat's because the U.S. hasn't directly intervened militarily to back Ukraine, and the locations where these submarines operate are not best suited to launch attacks against Russian adversaries, since the cruise missiles would go over NATO countries like Romania, Clark said.\n\"It's unlikely to be a cruise missile attack that we threaten or even conduct,\" Clark said. \"I think it's much more likely that we will be using attack submarines to sort of convey to the Russians that we can hold important targets of their own at risk if they do decide to escalate.\"\nAsked whether Russia might respond with its own maneuvers, Shoemaker was unequivocal: \"Yes, almost certainly. Russia routinely and historically likes to do comparable responses to American actions.\"\nMoran pointed to a recent example from 2024: \"Russia moved ships near Cuba, and we responded by surfacing a submarine in Guantanamo Bay. That\u2019s a case of operational schedules aligning with an opportunity to send a message.\"\nBut such cat-and-mouse signaling carries risk.\n\"Missteps can be made. Things can be misinterpreted,\" Moran warned. \"We\u2019ve been here before.\"\nConnor agreed that the oceans will remain a chessboard of silent signaling.\n\"Both countries have the freedom to operate as they would like in international waters,\" he said. \"They\u2019ve done that for decades and will likely continue to do so.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe move appears to be part deterrence, part diplomacy.\nTrump \"is showing annoyance with Russia\u2019s unwillingness to negotiate seriously on Ukraine,\" said Cancian. \"But more significantly, he\u2019s pushing back on Russia\u2019s nuclear saber-rattling \u2014 a pattern that\u2019s existed since the beginning of the war.\""

  "argos_summary": "President Donald Trump has shifted his stance on Russian President Vladimir Putin, expressing frustration over Russia's actions in the ongoing Ukraine conflict. Recently, Trump announced the repositioning of two U.S. nuclear submarines as a warning to Russia amid stalled peace negotiations and increased military aggression from Moscow. He has also imposed a new, shortened deadline for Russia to agree to a peace deal, while signaling potential economic sanctions if progress is not made.
