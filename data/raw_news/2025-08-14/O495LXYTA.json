  "description": "Prosecutors say there was \"no reasonable likelihood of conviction\" in case against rookie running back.",
  "content": "Prosecutors in Florida have opted not to move forward with a case against Cleveland Browns rookie running back Quinshon Judkins following his arrest last month in Fort Lauderdale on a domestic violence charge, the assistant state attorney announced in a memorandum on Thursday.\n\nThe Browns declined to comment on Thursday\u2019s news when reached by The Athletic. An NFL spokesperson said: \u201cWe have been following developments in the matter, which remains under review.\u201d\n\nJudkins, 21, was arrested on July 12 in Fort Lauderdale. The police report alleged that Judkins struck a woman with a closed fist on July 7 and that bruising was still visible to police when the woman reported the incident five days later. Judkins was released from jail on a $2,500 bond July 13, and later canceled a public meet-and-greet and a youth football camp he was scheduled to host in Cleveland.\n\nIn the memorandum released Thursday, in which the state announced it would not move forward with the case, authorities said they reviewed body-worn camera videos, surveillance video of places the couple had been, photos showing bruising and marks on the victim and cell phone text messages and calls. Authorities said the July 7 incident occurred when the couple came to Fort Lauderdale following a family trip to Hawaii in which \u201csome family drama\u201d emerged between Judkins\u2019 family and the alleged victim and her friends.\n\n\u201cThe victim was annoyed with the defendant for not responding to her about the text messages or defending her to his family,\u201d the memo said. A verbal argument then became physical when, \u201cHe pointed his finger at the victim, and she slapped his hand away, also punching him.\u201d The victim claimed Judkins then punched her in the mouth, cutting her lip.\n\nWhile the victim supplied photos from her phone showing bruises and cuts to her face and arms, authorities said when they reviewed closed-circuit security videos of the couple, \u201cno visible signs of the bruising or cuts to the victim\u2019s face or arms could be seen in the videos.\u201d\n\nBecause of this, the memorandum stated, along with the fact that the incident was not captured on any video surveillance and there were no independent witnesses to the incident, as well as the delay in the incident being reported, authorities decided \u201cthere is no reasonable likelihood of conviction, and this case is being declined\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether this decision means Judkins will be able to rejoin the Browns, or when that might happen. The NFL and the Browns have their own investigations into the matter, and it should be noted that Judkins is not currently under contract with the team, as he had not yet signed his rookie deal when he was arrested four weeks ago.\n\nJudkins worked with both the No. 1 and No. 2 offenses at various times during the spring. The Browns drafted Judkins at No. 36 in April with the belief that he would fit their wide-zone run scheme and be a significant contributor during his rookie season.\n\nJerome Ford opened camp as the No. 1 running back. Ford, who\u2019s in the final year of his rookie contract, took a pay cut in the spring to essentially guarantee his roster spot. The other veteran in the running back room is Pierre Strong Jr., who\u2019s also only signed through 2025 and has mostly been a special teams player.\n\nThe Browns also selected a second running back in the draft in fourth-rounder Dylan Sampson. Fellow running back Ahmani Marshall joined the team as an undrafted free agent. It is unclear, for now, how this latest development with Judkins will affect the pecking order in the Browns\u2019 RB room.",

      "text": "Authorities arrested Cleveland Browns rookie running back Quinshon Judkins Saturday on a domestic violence and battery charge, according to the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.\nRecords showed that Judkins, 21, was in jail Saturday night on a charge of \u201ctouch or strike/battery/domestic violence.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe incident allegedly occurred on July 7 when Judkins and a woman left Fort Lauderdale International Airport together in a rental car and got into an argument, according to the arrest report. The woman said that Judkins punched her in the mouth/chin area with his fist, and later in the left arm and thigh after she had moved to the backseat, the report said.\nThe woman contacted police Saturday, saying she initially didn\u2019t call authorities because of Judkins\u2019 career. She chose to contact the police after speaking with her friends and family, per the arrest report.\nJudkins appeared in court for a bond hearing Sunday, with a judge ordering him not to contact the woman or access firearms, according to CBS News Miami. He was released from jail Sunday afternoon on $2,500 bond, per CBS News Miami.\nThe Browns said they are \u201caware and gathering more information.\u201d The Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office did not immediately respond to inquiries from The Athletic.\nThis marks the second consecutive year a Browns second-round draft pick has been arrested in connection with domestic violence before the season. Mike Hall Jr. was arrested on domestic violence charges in August and pleaded no contest.\nJudkins is coming off a national championship season at Ohio State and could be the Browns\u2019 top back this season, although he hasn\u2019t been signed yet. The No. 36 pick in this year\u2019s draft rushed 1,060 yards \u2014 his third time in three seasons \u2014 and caught 22 passes for 161 yards as a Buckeye. Judkins spent his first two seasons at Ole Miss, where he rushed for 2,725 yards and scored 31 touchdowns, averaging 104 yards per contest.\n(Photo: Nick Cammett / Getty Images)"
