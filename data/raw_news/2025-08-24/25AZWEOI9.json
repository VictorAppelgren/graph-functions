  "description": "This deadly bacteria, which hits low-income people the hardest, was once an \u201conly in New York\u201d problem. Extreme heat is now increasing its prevalence.",
  "content": "This story originally appeared on Vox and is part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nAir conditioners have been working overtime this hot summer, from those tiny window units to the massive AC towers that serve the tightly packed apartment buildings in major cities. And while they bring the relief of cool air, these contraptions also create the conditions for dangerous bacteria to multiply and spread.\n\nOne particularly nasty bacteria-borne illness is currently spreading in New York City using those enormous cooling units as its vector: Legionnaire\u2019s disease. The bacterial pneumonia, which usually recurs each summer in the US\u2019s largest city, has sickened more than 100 people and killed five in a growing outbreak.\n\nIf you don\u2019t live in New York City or the Northeast, you may never have heard of Legionnaire\u2019s, but this niche public health threat may not be niche for much longer.\n\nClimate change is helping to make Legionnaire\u2019s disease both more plentiful in the places where it already exists and creating the potential for it to move to new places where the population may not be accustomed to it. Cities in the Northeast and Midwest, where hotter weather meets older infrastructure, have reported more cases in recent years. Recently, Legionella bacteria was discovered in a nursing home\u2019s water system in Dearborn, Michigan\u2014one of the states, along with Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Wisconsin, that have seen more activity in the past few years.\n\nAnyone can contract Legionnaire\u2019s disease by inhaling tiny drops containing the bacteria, and the symptoms\u2014fever, headache, shortness of breath\u2014appear within days. It can cause a severe lung infection, with a death rate of around 10 percent.\n\nWhile healthier people often experience few symptoms, the more vulnerable\u2014young children, the elderly, pregnant people, and those with compromised immune systems\u2014face serious danger from the illness. Around 5,000 people die every year in the United States from Legionnaire\u2019s disease, many of them living in low-income housing with outdated cooling equipment where the bacteria can more readily grow and spread.\n\nLegionnaire\u2019s disease is a microcosm of climate change\u2019s impact on low-income communities. As warmer temperatures facilitate the spread of disease, the most socially vulnerable populations are going to pay the steepest price.\n\nThe Collision of Legionnaire\u2019s Disease, Climate Change, and Economic Disparities\n\nLegionnaire\u2019s disease was first documented after an unusually aggressive pneumonia outbreak during an American Legion conference in Philadelphia in 1976. Soon, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists confirmed the cause of the mysterious illness: a previously unknown bacteria that was accordingly named Legionella. Legionella, unfortunately, is everywhere\u2014in streams, lakes, and water pipes across the country.\n\nBut usually, it occurs in such low concentrations and is so remote that it doesn\u2019t pose a threat to humans. Usually.\n\nNow, city health officials have found the bacteria in the large cooling tanks that serve massive apartment buildings across New York City, particularly in Harlem. Cooling tanks are ideal places for Legionnaire\u2019s to grow and spread. They\u2019re filled with stagnant, warm water that is more hospitable to bacterial growth. Like an evaporative cooler, the systems convert warm stagnant water into cool air for apartment dwellers. They can spray mists laden with the bacteria into the open air, dispersing it across the surrounding air, where it can enter a person\u2019s lungs when they inhale. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 80 percent of Legionnaire\u2019s cases are linked to potable water systems.",

Soon, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists confirmed the cause of the mysterious illness: a previously unknown bacteria that was accordingly named Legionella. Legionella, unfortunately, is everywhere \u2014 in streams, lakes, and water pipes across the country.\nBut usually, it occurs in such low concentrations and is so remote that it doesn\u2019t pose a threat to humans. Usually.\nNow, city health officials have found the bacteria in the large cooling tanks that serve massive apartment buildings across New York City, particularly in Harlem. Cooling tanks are ideal for Legionella to grow and spread. They\u2019re filled with stagnant, warm water that is more hospitable to bacterial growth. Like an evaporative cooler, the systems convert warm stagnant water into cool air for apartment dwellers. They can spray mists laden with the bacteria into the open air, dispersing it across the surrounding air, where it can enter a person\u2019s lungs when they inhale. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 80 percent of Legionnaire\u2019s cases are linked to potable water systems.\nSummers have always been prime time for the spread of Legionnaire\u2019s, and climate change only exacerbates all of these problems. For starters, the quality of natural water is degrading \u2014 creating more favorable conditions for Legionella, which loves acidic water and low oxygen levels, to multiply \u2014 as the planet warms. In the summer, the higher the temperatures and the more humid the air, the easier it is for the bacteria to reproduce in these cooling systems.\nA decade ago, researchers warned that \u201cclimate change might increase the incidence of legionellosis through increased reliance on air conditioning systems,\u201d especially the large units serving city housing buildings. The European Climate and Health Observatory advised in 2022 that higher temperatures and the increased rainfall associated with climate change could soon make Legionnaire\u2019s disease a more widespread issue.\nThe EPA also expects the bacteria\u2019s range to expand as global temperatures rise. Each heat wave and heavy rainstorm creates the hot and wet conditions that allow Legionella to thrive. Flooding can allow Legionella-tainted water to more easily penetrate a community\u2019s water system, too.\nAnd those who live in a low-income area are more likely to be at risk from this increased prevalence of Legionnaire\u2019s disease. As the New York Times reported recently, poorly maintained cooling systems are more likely to see Legionella flourish and pump the bacteria into their neighborhoods \u2014 and low-income housing is more likely to be poorly maintained. Though NYC attempted to require more inspections for defective cooling systems after a 2015 outbreak of Legionnaire\u2019s, inspections have fallen off in recent years, according to reporting from The Gothamist.\nThis dynamic isn\u2019t unique to Legionnaire\u2019s disease. As the EPA has observed, low-income people are more likely to face health consequences from climate change because they are more likely to live in places exposed to extreme weather, they are more likely to have health conditions that make them more vulnerable to infectious diseases and natural disasters \u2014 and they are more likely to live with the kind of aging infrastructure that allows Legionnaire\u2019s to flourish.\nWhat you can do to protect yourself\nLegionnaire\u2019s is a particularly disconcerting health threat: It rains down from the sky in tiny invisible droplets, packed with bacteria so potent it can kill one in 10 people whom it manages to infect through its telltale aggressive pneumonia. It is as deadly as tuberculosis, though Legionnaire\u2019s disease usually kills much faster.\nI asked some experts what people can do about Legionnaire\u2019s disease. The most important advice was to be vigilant about any public health warnings if you reside in an area where Legionella has historically lived or has recently been detected, especially if you have certain preexisting conditions like diabetes, chronic lung disease, or autoimmune disorders, or if you\u2019re over the age of 50. Follow the news and make sure you\u2019re registered for alerts from your local public health officials.\nPeople could consider investing in a high-quality water filter during an outbreak, the CDC says. If you use an evaporative cooler or your home is equipped with a swamp cooler, you can make sure you\u2019re keeping them clean and using filtered water, if possible.\nBut the issue here is ultimately not your small humidifier. The problem resides much further up the water supply chain, in the massive community water systems where Legionella flourish. You can\u2019t suddenly stop drinking water or breathing air, of course, even if there is a local outbreak. The CDC itself notes that point-of-use water filters only provide limited protection.\nSo, whenever you know Legionnaire\u2019s disease is spreading nearby, you should be paying attention to your body, said Janet Stout, president and director of the Special Pathogens Laboratory, who has studied the disease for 30 years. See your doctor immediately if you\u2019re experiencing fever, shortness of breath, or a cough. You could have a special test done for Legionnaire\u2019s disease and potentially receive antibiotics, such as levofloxacin or azithromycin, that have proven effective against the bacteria. Most cases can be cured if they are caught early enough.\nBut this is a truly public health challenge; when bacteria are multiplying in community water systems and then spewing into the open air, anyone can be exposed. There is only so much that any one person\u2019s own, individual effort can do to stop infections.\nThe main way to prevent Legionnaire\u2019s disease, however, or at least significantly reduce its risk, is by staying on top of maintenance to make sure community water sources are kept clean, preventing the bacteria from proliferating. But that kind of maintenance requires vigilance and perhaps even public pressure. In New York City, for example, only 1,200 cooling towers were inspected in the first six months of 2025, a steep drop-off from 2017 when the city had checked more than 5,000 over the same period.\nLandlords and public health authorities must take Legionnaire\u2019s disease seriously. We are going to see more and more outbreaks as climate change continues to heat the planet."

  "argos_summary": "Legionnaire\u2019s disease, a bacterial pneumonia that thrives in warm, stagnant water, is spreading in New\u202fYork City through large cooling towers, sickening over 100 people and killing five in a recent outbreak. Climate change is amplifying the problem by raising temperatures and humidity, which favor Legionella growth, and is pushing the disease into new regions such as Michigan and other Midwest states. The illness disproportionately affects low\u2011income communities that rely on aging, poorly maintained air\u2011conditioning infrastructure, and the death rate can reach 10%. Public health officials warn that early detection, regular inspection of cooling systems, and community water\u2011system maintenance are essential to curb future outbreaks, yet inspections have fallen sharply in recent years.",
