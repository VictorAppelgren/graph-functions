  "content": "Here at Top Comments we welcome longtime as well as brand new Daily Kos readers to join us at 10pm Eastern. We strive to nourish community by rounding up some of the site's best, funniest, most mojo'd & most informative commentary, and we depend on your help!! If you see a comment by another Kossack that deserves wider recognition, please send it either to topcomments at gmail or to the Top Comments group mailbox by 9:30pm Eastern. Please please please include a few words about why you sent it in as well as your user name (even if you think we know it already :-)), so we can credit you with the find! Just a quick note saying hello and wishing everyone currently at the Netroots Nation conference a fascinating, educational, and (most importantly in these times) safe conference in The Big Easy. I really wish that I could be there. Of all the Netroots that I have been to, 2018 Netroots in New Orleans remains my personal favorite. However, I just couldn\u2019t swing it with the finances this year. Another trip to New Orleans remains on my bucket list (not for Mardi Gras, though, I don\u2019t think). Enjoy yourselves. Eat good! (That\u2019s hard not to do in New Orleans.) Visit historic sites. And do forget to report back.\n\nBrillig's ObDisclaimer: The decision to publish each nomination lies with the evening's Diarist and/or Comment Formatter. My evenings at the helm, I try reeeeallllyy hard to publish everything without regard to content. I really do, even when I disagree personally with any given nomination. \"TopCommentness\" lies in the eyes of the nominator and of you, the reader - I leave the decision to you. I do not publish self-nominations (ie your own comments) and if I ruled the world, we'd all build community, supporting and uplifting instead of tearing our fellow Kossacks down. Please remember that comment inclusion in Top Comments does not constitute support or endorsement by diarist, formatter, Top Comments writers or DailyKos. Questions, complaints or comments? Contact brillig.\n\nTop Mojo for yesterday, Thursday, August 7, 2025, first comments and tip jars excluded. Thank you mik for the mojo magic! For those of you interested in How Top Mojo Works, please see his diary on FAQing Top Mojo.",

      "text": "I have not been in the habit of listening to the news on NPR. All I usually listen to on NPR, in fact, is classical music while driving. However, I\u2019ve read many stories here on DK over several years, decrying NPR News as wishy-washy and inclined to kowtow to the government, in fact toeing the government line, and in the case of Trump, pretty much licking his toes.\nYesterday afternoon, while driving back to the RV from a doctor\u2019s appointment, my husband turned on NPR News. I was shocked---in a good way. They led off with news about the economy. It\u2019s heading downhill, they said. They presented some expert opinions to bolster this judgement. Then they segued into tariffs. Further expert opinions opined that tariffs will make a poor economic situation even worse.\nFinally they changed the subject to Trump\u2019s efforts to end the Russo-Ukraine War. They introduced this with recordings: short statements from Trump expressing his opinions on the subject as they changed over time. This was followed by statements from experts, one of whom suggested that Trump is \u201cbeing played\u201d by Putin.\nI was flabbergasted. Was this the NPR News that\u2019s supposedly kowtowing to Trump at every turn? But of course, we all know what happened in the last few days. Trump and his minions completely ended the funding for PBS and NPR. Like everything else they do, they failed to think it through: what would be the effects of doing so? One very obvious effect (or at least it ought to have been obvious) was that these entities would no longer feel any obligation to soft-pedal or completely muffle any criticism of the government---or in this case, of Trump. Apparently it didn\u2019t take long to go into effect.\nSo we can say that, as long as PBS and NPR can find funding elsewhere to replace what was lost, Trump & Co. have done them a big favor. They have been unleashed, no longer obligated to consider the effect of their programming on government entities. What will evolve from this effect? We can only wait and see."

      "text": "As the wrangler of the reconstituted \"Top Mojo\" feature of the daily \"Top Comments\" diary series, I am often called upon to defend explain how it works. This diary is an attempt to memorialize that need for an interested audience, soooo.... if, sometime in the future, you publicly rant something along the lines of \"Why the @(&# didn't my most awesome comment in the history of the blogosphere make it into the Top Mojo list?!?\", then you've hopefully been pointed here, where the answer likely lurks below the little orange sponge thingy:\nQ: Why the hell didn't my comment make the list?!\nA: I don't really know, but there are a few likely explanations. Try them on for size and see if any fit your circumstance (in order of likelihood!):\n- The current Top Mojo is for a different day than you posted your comment.\n- Your comment didn't have enough mojo to make the list when Top Mojo ran.\n- DailyKos search was broken when Top Mojo ran.\n- Your comment couldn't be Searched.\n- Your comment was dropped from consideration because it didn't pass the comment filter.\nQ: Hmm... Hey wait a second! There's a comment filter?!?\nA: Yes, but I'm not going to talk about it until later, in the (probably futile) hope that you'll read the explanations of the first four, because chances are darned good that if your awesomely mojoed comment is at all legitimate, one of the first four is the reason it wasn't in yesterday's list.\nQ: Okay, So what did you mean by \"Top Mojo is for a different day than I posted\"?\nA: Today's Top Comments always has Top Mojo for yesterday's comment history: If you posted your comment today (calendar day as defined by EST time zone), look in tomorrow's TC.\nQ: My head hurts. Why would you do that?\nA: Top Comments is posted daily at 10pm EST, but (obviously) is usually written somewhat earlier. For purposes of discussion, lets assume the TC diarist finished writing at 8pm EST. If Top Mojo looked for today's comments, that would mean at minimum 4 full hours of comments that could never show up in Top Mojo because \"today\" wouldn't be a full day, no matter when you might be reading TC.\nQ: Huh? I mean, why is that?\"\nA: midnight to \"now\" is only 20 hours at 8pm. In practice, the script runs at 6pm EST to give the diarist of the day time to ping me if search happened to be broken then, so that I have a chance of re-running it before publication time.\nQ: No, I mean why don't you run Top Mojo to look for comments in the last 24 hours instead of today/yesterday?\"\nA1: because DailyKos search doesn't let you specify time-of-day. Don't believe me? Go ahead, I'll wait.... (tapping fingers)... See? Told you so. Yes it is, frankly, amazing that search doesn't support time-of-day. Yes, \"they\" are aware that it isn't implemented. No, I don't know why it wasn't a gimme. No, I don't have any special access to the database and can't easily hack around the missing feature without raising other issues (see below).\nA2: Even if it could search based on \"last 24 hours\", you wouldn't want to use that as the basis of Top Mojo. Consider your next most awesome comment ever that you happen to post 1 minute before the script runs: by the time you read Top Mojo tomorrow (remember, TM is for the day before the TC it appears in!), it has 37298 recommends, but when the script ran, it only had 2.\nQ: Alright, but I (and Markos!) live in California, why are you talking about Eastern Time constantly? My day doesn't match, and I see DailyKos all in PST! Why do you hate the rest of the country/world/time zones?\nA: The dailykos search engine doesn't let you specify time zone, so it uses the time zone where the computer is physically located - New York, last I checked. If the DailyKos team moves the servers to a different timezone without changing software, the Top Mojo \"day\" will move accordingly.\nQ: Okay, I get all that. But I posted last night before midnight EST and it still didn't show up in today's TM!\nA: What sometimes happens is that the mojo changes significantly, sometimes enough to bump a comment into the TM list, after 6pm EST. Sorry.\nQ: Can you redo it just before posting?\nA: Sure. Convince the TC diarists. Seriously: there's no technical issue here, but rather a risk of abuse of volunteers issue. The current schedule works pretty well most of the time, but if the TC diarists would be willing to hold off until the last instant to pull in the TM HTML, then TM is there to support them.\nQ: What about posting a longer list so that more comments with great mojo are caught?\nA: Sure, though the current number matches the old TM system (30 comments, more if there are ties for 30). Personally, I think fewer would be better - maybe top 10 - but whatever. One issue is that if you need more than 50 comments to fill your 30 slots, the script needs to run multiple searches which have to be spaced out to avoid the Denial Of Service attack filters and increases the chances of something bad happening a bit.\nQ: Something bad? what does that mean?\nA: Here's explanation 3: Sometimes the site goes down. If a human clicks on a site and gets a blank screen, she says \"huh, how 'bout that?\" and reloads. If a script sees a blank screen, it can be more complicated. Here's the thing about programming (and the TM is a small program, after all): you need to imagine all the things that can go wrong that you care about and plan for what to do about them in advance. In practice, well, we're talking about a minor feature of a community diary, not a mission to Alpha Centauri, so the \"what you care about\" is pretty small - when something breaks, I take a coffee break from my job and try and fix it. Usually when the site is down, or even just search, the result is an empty Top Mojo. Sometimes when the diarist finds out early enough, I can kick the script manually or somesuch and you might never notice, except that since the actual run time is different, the results might be a little different than you might expect.\nQ: But Big Orange was just fine all day (including yesterday at 6pm EST!), I promise!\nA: It doesn't take much to screw things up, but even so, the DailyKos search function is somewhat... fragile. Sometimes the site is just fine, the diary search is just fine, but the comment search is hosed. Sorry.\nQ: Well, what about the secret \"comment filter\"? What's that all about?\nA: Tip jars. Top Mojo tries to avoid including comments that are obviously tip jars. The aim of Top Comments (and thus Top Mojo) is to draw attention to really good comments that you might have missed in your busy day. Tip jars aren't (usually) comments, they are ways to give feedback to diarists that they did good... a nice thing to track for sure, but not what TM is about.\nQ: So how do you filter out tip jars?\nA: sorry, I'm not putting the rules here - there's nothing that you would find surprising and I'm sure you could guess most of the handful of rules in less than 10min, but I do adjust them every once in a while and don't want to have to maintain this FAQ or risk the wrath of someone who is taking it too seriously.\nQ: What was that about unsearchable comments?\nA: Top Mojo results should be accessible for all readers, so the TM search is run as an anonymous reader. Among other things, this means that comments in deleted diaries, and hidden comment chains will not appear in Top Mojo.\nQ: anything ELSE you aren't telling us?\nA: not really, though I'm sure I've forgotten a few cases (and will stick them above this question as they arise)\nQ: I have a great idea! Why don't you implement (insert idea here) feature?\nA: The snarky answer would be \"knock yourself out,\" but I'd love to hear ideas that make it all easier to understand and/or more useful and/or less prone to errors. So, feel free to comment, email, whatever.\nQ: But my most awesome comment ever that didn't appear in Top Mojo isn't covered by any of those!\nA1: Sorry, shit happens.\nA2: Don't you think you are taking Top Mojo a little too seriously? It isn't like you get a prize or a badge on your avatar!\nA3: If you reeeeeally care that much, send me the link to your long lost comment and I'll research it. If it I can figure out what happened and it isn't covered by one of the above cases, I'll fix the script and rerun and you can try talking the diarist into updating the mojo for the day.... If it does turn out to be one of the above, you can buy me a beer at Netroots.\nA4: here, have a Top Mojo sticker!\nGood night, and thanks for your attention!"
