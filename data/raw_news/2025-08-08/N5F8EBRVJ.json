  "description": "Blake Lively scored two victories Friday in her bitter legal battle with her \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d co-star Justin Baldoni, as a judge ruled to keep her deposition transcript under wraps.",
  "content": "Blake Lively scored two victories Friday in her heated legal battle with \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d co-star Justin Baldoni, with a judge ruling to keep her deposition transcript under wraps \u2014 at least for now.\n\nManhattan federal Judge Lewis Liman issued two blistering orders, one of which scolded Baldoni\u2019s side for seemingly trying to \u201cinvite public speculation and scandal\u201d when his lawyers filed a nearly 300-page temporarily sealed transcript of Lively\u2019s deposition on a public court docket.\n\nLiman struck the deposition from the record, saying while it may be normal for judges to consider parts of depositions during litigation, \u201cit is not routine, however, for parties to attach an entire confidential deposition transcript when citing only limited portions of that transcript \u2026 in order to put the other side and the court to the burden of justifying continued sealing.\u201d\n\nThe parts of, or the entire, deposition could still come out at later points in the case, including potentially at the trial, which is currently scheduled for March 2026.\n\nThe \u201cGossip Girl\u201d star\u2019s lawyers Monday accused Baldoni of \u201ccreating a media circus\u201d by leaking details of the deposition the day she was grilled by his lawyers in Manhattan last week.\n\nAnd then by posting the temporarily sealed transcript on the case docket, forcing her to unnecessarily argue for it to remain sealed.\n\nBaldoni\u2019s side \u2014 which includes the film\u2019s production company Wayfarer Studios LLC \u2014 posted the transcript the day after the deposition to bolster their arguments that Baldoni and his lawyers weren\u2019t in cahoots to carry out a smear campaign against her.\n\nBut Liman\u2019s ruling, said Baldoni\u2019s letter only quotes \u201cone fragment of one sentence from Lively\u2019s deposition.\u201d\n\nLiman agreed with Lively, saying: \u201cThe conclusion is inescapable that the Wayfarer Parties filed gratuitous amounts of irrelevant pages so that, if Lively moved for continued sealing of the irrelevant pages, the Wayfarer Parties could then use Lively\u2019s response for their own public-relations purposes. The Court has not only the power but also the responsibility to step in.\u201d\n\nThe judge issued an unrelated ruling Friday addressing a series of letters to the court filed by celebrity blogger Perez Hilton \u2014 who is currently fighting a subpoena from Lively \u2014 ordering him to be more respectful and follow court rules of conduct or risk being held in contempt of court.\n\nHilton filed six letters to the court this week, including one Wednesday in which he called Lively a \u201cplantation-loving princess\u201d and her lawyer \u201cdeplorable.\u201d\n\nLiman barred any further use of \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and \u201cintemperate\u201d language, \u201cdemeaning nicknames,\u201d and \u201cpersonal attacks\u201d in court filings.\n\nHilton exclusively told The Post Friday that he would \u201cdefinitely\u201d follow the judge\u2019s order going forward and wrote a new letter in which he believes he threaded the needle of conveying his outrage while \u201cexpressing that in a respectful manner.\u201d\n\nHilton \u2014 whose real name is Mario Lavandeira, Jr. \u2014 was dragged into the case when Lively issued a subpoena for any work correspondence he may have exchanged with Baldoni\u2019s side, as part of Lively\u2019s argument that she\u2019s been the target of a negative public relations campaign.\n\nHilton is seeking to quash that subpoena, arguing the records her side is seeking are shielded from laws protecting journalists.\n\nLively, 37, filed her bombshell lawsuit against Baldoni \u2014 who directed the flick \u2014 claiming he sexually harassed her, in part, by sharing details of his sex life and porn addiction with her.\n\nThen he eventually tried to tarnish her reputation in the press.\n\nBaldoni, 41 \u2014 an alum of show \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d \u2014 filed a countersuit claiming Lively and her \u201cDeadpool\u201d actor husband Ryan Reynolds extorted and defamed him.",

To the extent addresses are included in filings, is because it is required to do so under federal law to establish either that service of a subpoena has been completed or that service was not completed,\u201d they told The Post. \u201cThis is a required part of the process per FRCP Rules 4 and 45.\u201d\nLively, 37, launched her bombshell accusations against Baldoni, 41, in a $250 million lawsuit in December. She claimed he sexually harassed her on the set of the 2024 movie, which he directed and co-starred in.\nBaldoni \u2014 an alum TV show \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d \u2014 then launched a $400 million countersuit for extortion and defamation against Lively and her husband, \u201cDeadpool\u201d star Ryan Reynolds.\nThat suit was dismissed last month by Manhattan federal Judge Lewis Liman.\nLively is slated to be deposed by Baldoni\u2019s lawyers Thursday."
