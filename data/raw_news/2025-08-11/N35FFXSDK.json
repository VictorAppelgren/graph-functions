  "content": "Google is expected to unveil the Pixel Watch 4 at its upcoming event with the Pixel 10 series. According to the leaked promo material, Google says the Pixel Watch 4 is \u201cprecision crafted\u201d and \u201cperformance ready.\u201d\n\nThe Pixel Watch 4 is to have a new \u201cActua 360\u201d display, and could reach up to 3,000 nits peak brightness. The device will come in the same two sizes as the Pixel Watch 3, 41mm and 45mm sizes, but this time with a redesigned look that uses a domed, curved glass face. But it looks fairly similar to its predecessor. Battery life is rated at 30 hours for the 41mm model and 40 hours for the 45mm version, both with always-on display. Google will be adding a new Quick Charge Dock, charging 25% faster than previous Pixel Watch versions.\n\nAccording to the leak, the Pixel Watch 4 is to have dual-frequency GPS, found on Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Watch 8 and Apple\u2019s Watch Ultra, as reported by 9to5Google. This lets the watch track locations more accurately in urban or crowded settings. The watch has more than forty exercise modes, ECG, SpO2, breathing rate, heart rate variability (HRV), and a Loss of Pulse Detection function.\n\nGemini will play a central role. As per the promo, users will be able to raise their wrist for quick Gemini responses, get personalized help, and receive text suggestions that sound more natural and less AI. The watch will continue to ship with two years of data on Google Fi Wireless for LTE models.\n\nOverall, if the leaked information is right, the Pixel Watch 4 will add a new screen, charging, and GPS accuracy, while placing Google\u2019s Gemini AI at the center of its user experience. The official announcement is likely to come alongside the Pixel 10 series on August 20, 2025, but there might be a delay in the launch.",
