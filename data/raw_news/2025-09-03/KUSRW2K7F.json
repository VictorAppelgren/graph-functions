  "content": "The U.S. economy is enduring a challenging year but isn\u2019t going over a cliff.\n\nThrough increases for imports of steel, aluminum and automotive products, Mr. Trump\u2019s broad reciprocal tariffs and special levies on Canada and Mexico to coerce cooperation on drugs and illegal immigration, the average duty on imports is up about 16 percentage points to 18%.\n\nThough the president\u2019s reciprocal tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act face a questionable future in the courts, he has other options to sustain those.\n\nNegotiations with China and many other major trading partners are unlikely to conclude with comprehensive agreements anytime soon, and the deals with Britain, the European Union, Vietnam and others didn\u2019t alter tariffs much.\n\nHence, higher taxes on imports are likely for the remainder of Mr. Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nAt present levels, those tariffs would generate about $3 trillion in additional revenue over the next decade. That would offset most of the deficit-increasing effects of the president\u2019s additional tax cuts and spending initiatives.\n\nLarge federal deficits and growing national debt are problems, but Mr. Trump\u2019s overall fiscal policies should not significantly alter these trends.\n\nIn the near term, the tariffs are a drag on the economy because those and some of his spending cuts are biting this year, while most tax cuts won\u2019t show up in paychecks until next year.\n\nFor shoppers, tariffs have not been highly visible. Inflation has ticked up and will likely accelerate further this fall.\n\nWhen the president boosted tariffs on washing machines in January 2018, the consumer price index for laundry equipment showed little effect in February and March and jumped 11% by May.\n\nAs inflation accelerates, consumers will borrow more or spend less. It likely will be some of each, as banks are preparing for more losses on credit cards and other loans. With less inflation-adjusted spending, the pace of economic activity will remain slow.\n\nIn January, economic forecasters predicted 2% gross domestic product growth for this year, but with the tariffs, it will likely average only about 1.5%.\n\nThe conventional thinking is that the Federal Reserve could lower interest rates to boost homebuilders, debt-burdened consumers and overall economic growth, but at the expense of stoking inflation.\n\nHowever, the Fed could prove mostly powerless.\n\nFrom September to December last year, the Fed cut the federal funds rate, the overnight rate that banks pay to borrow funds, a full percentage point, but the rate on 10-year Treasury bonds jumped from about 3.6% to 4.6%.\n\nThat 10-year rate is the benchmark for most borrowing throughout the economy. So even as the Fed cut the bank overnight rate last fall, the rate on 30-year mortgages jumped about a percentage point.\n\nIn a full-employment, peacetime economy, a federal deficit exceeding 6% of GDP is unprecedented. Treasury borrowing requirements are overwhelming anything the Fed could do.\n\nWith fiscal and monetary policy essentially unchanged, the impacts of the Trump tariffs on the economy would be largely on the supply side if businesses had some certainty about how trade policy would settle out.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to say the average tariff on imports will stay at 18%, but it\u2019s another to know what rates will be charged on specific products from various countries.\n\nWith more certainty about those tariffs, businesses could adjust supply chains more cost-efficiently by, for example, investing to source more from Vietnam and Mexico and less from China and manufacturing more in the United States. Still, early episodes with items as simple as children\u2019s toys indicate that finding new suppliers can take months.\n\nParents will face fewer choices, shortages and higher prices filling Christmas stockings. Similar frustrations will repeat throughout the economy.\n\nBuilding a new manufacturing capacity for complex products such as automobiles and cellphones can take years.\n\nThe best clarity business may assume is that Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs will stay mostly as they are or rise closer to 20%. That realization will come slowly, and business investment outside hot artificial-intelligence-related activities will recover, but only slowly.\n\nGDP fell 0.5% in the first quarter because imports surged in March ahead of the Liberation Day tariffs.\n\nThat reversed in the second quarter, but tariffs are burdening demand this summer and fall.\n\nIn 2026, the economy should revert to 2% growth, in line with the consensus outlook before the tariffs.\n\nWhile slower than in 2024, we won\u2019t have a recession.\n\nInflation should surge above 3% and then subside as we move through 2026 if the Fed doesn\u2019t enable reckless federal deficits by slashing interest rates.\n\nThe economy will be back on track next year. The hit to growth and purchasing power from tariffs will prove a one-time adjustment as we learn to live with Mr. Trump\u2019s protectionism.\n\u2022 Peter Morici is an economist and emeritus business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.",

  "summary": "The article discusses the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs on the economy, which have increased imports by 16 percentage points to 18%. The tariffs, which cover steel, aluminum, and automotive products, are seen as a significant increase in imports and are likely to increase further. The author suggests that these tariffs could generate $3 trillion in additional revenue over the next decade, offsetting the deficit-increasing effects of additional tax cuts and spending initiatives. However, the author acknowledges that large federal deficits and growing national debt are a significant issue but does not significantly alter overall fiscal policies. The article suggests that the Federal Reserve may lower interest rates to boost homebuilders, debt-burdened consumers, but at the expense of increasing inflation. Despite this, inflation is expected to accelerate further this fall.",

  "argos_summary": "Trump\u2019s tariffs have raised import duties to about 18%, generating $3 trillion in revenue over a decade, but the article argues they will not push the U.S. economy into recession. The tariffs are expected to dampen GDP growth to roughly 1.5% in 2024, with inflation rising above 3% before easing by 2026. The Fed\u2019s rate cuts are limited by a steep 10\u2011year Treasury yield, and fiscal deficits remain high, so monetary policy has little room to offset the trade\u2011policy drag. Businesses will face supply\u2011chain adjustments and higher consumer prices, but the impact is seen as a one\u2011time adjustment rather than a structural collapse.",
