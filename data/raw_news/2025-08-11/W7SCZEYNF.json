  "content": "CINCINNATI \u2014 With the return of Hunter Greene to the rotation, the Cincinnati Reds have six starters for five spots, which could move rookie Chase Burns to the bullpen.\n\nRegardless of the role Burns is in, the Reds are hoping Burns is pitching for the team the rest of the season. Between the minors and majors this season, Burns has already surpassed the 100 innings he threw in his junior year at Wake Forest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in agreement that we do not want this kid stopping pitching,\u201d Reds manager Terry Francona said before Monday\u2019s 4-1 loss against the Philadelphia Phillies. \u201cSo how we get to the end? We might have to get a little creative.\u201d\n\nWhen the Reds acquired starter Zack Littell at the trade deadline, the plan was to move right-hander Nick Martinez to the bullpen and then maybe have Burns join him once Greene was ready.\n\nGreene is now ready, scheduled to make his first start in more than two months in Wednesday\u2019s series finale against the Phillies. Martinez, who picked up his 10th win of the season Saturday in Pittsburgh, will start Friday\u2019s series-opener against the National League Central-leading Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nThat means Burns could be the man headed to the bullpen, giving the Reds a legitimate weapon late in games. Burns, 22, has struck out 10 batters in four of his last five starts, with the lone exception coming in the start at Bristol Motor Speedway when the game was postponed in the bottom of the first inning. Burns struck out two of the three batters he faced in that game, before taking the hill again on Friday in Pittsburgh.\n\nAs a starter, Burns has been mixing in a changeup that is a pitch he\u2019ll need as a starter, but in the bullpen he\u2019ll be able to rely on his 100-mph fastball and his devastating slider. He could slide in behind closer Emilio Pag\u00e1n and setup man Tony Santillan to bolster the back of the Reds\u2019 bullpen.\n\nFrancona said he and pitching coach Derek Johnson talked to Burns about the possibility earlier on Monday.\n\nBurns will eventually move to the bullpen, but the question now is when? That\u2019s something Francona said hasn\u2019t been decided.\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Francona said before Monday\u2019s game. \u201cNo official updates yet.\u201d\n\nBurns didn\u2019t pitch at all last year after the Reds drafted him, but burned through the team\u2019s minor leagues after starting the season at High-A Dayton. At Dayton, Double-A Chattanooga and Triple-A Louisville, Burns threw 66 total innings. Since his debut on June 24, Burns has thrown 34 1/3 innings over eight starts, going 0-3 with a 5.24 ERA, but has struck more than a third of the batters he\u2019s faced, with 57 strikeouts against 151 batters faced.\n\nThe Reds, though, are not looking at a hard innings cap, Francona said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an \u2018-ish,\u2019\u201d Francona said in relation to the target number of innings for Burns. \u201cI think that can be a little cosmetic. You watch how the kid\u2019s throwing and also let the pitching guys and the trainers and the medical people use their judgment.\u201d\n\nMany of Burns\u2019 outings in the minors were on pitch counts, leading to longer outings than maybe would be suggested by his pitch counts. He was also so dominant (89 strikeouts against 13 walks) that there were few stressful innings on his way through the minors.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t necessarily been the case in the big leagues.\n\nBurns gave up five earned runs in his second start, at Boston on June 30, but was tipping his pitches. Taking that game out of the equation, he\u2019s only allowed one other earned run in the first three innings of those seven starts. Even including the game against the Red Sox, batters are hitting just .203/.288/.305 against him the first time through the order. The second time hitters see him, they\u2019re hitting .327/.377/.633.\n\nGreene, who was taken by the Reds with the second pick in the 2017 draft, will make his first start in more than two months Wednesday in the Reds\u2019 series finale against the Phillies. Greene went on the injured list with a right groin strain after his start on June 3 and hadn\u2019t pitched in the big leagues since then.\n\nBurns was expected to go to the bullpen when Greene returned, but that was before lefty Nick Lodolo went on the IL with a blister on his left index finger. Lodolo is throwing smooth plyo balls to keep his arm in shape without dealing with the seams of the baseball that contribute to the blister.\n\nMartinez made a relief appearance last week in Chicago before earning his 10th win of the season Saturday in Pittsburgh, allowing just one run on four hits over seven innings.\n\nLeaving Martinez in the rotation would allow Burns to pitch deeper into the season and perhaps in the postseason, if the Reds were to qualify. Martinez would return to the bullpen when Lodolo was ready. Of course, there\u2019s a lot of things that could happen between now and then.\n\nFor now, Greene is starting Wednesday, followed by Martinez on Friday. Beyond that, nothing is set in stone.",
