  "description": "Wall Street is rallying after the head of the Federal Reserve hinted cuts to interest rates may be coming, though he gave no clear clue about when.",
  "content": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Wall Street is rallying on Friday toward its best day in months after the head of the Federal Reserve hinted the cuts to interest rates that investors and President Donald Trump crave so much may be on the way.\n\nThe S&P 500 leaped 1.6%, and its first gain in six days has it on track to top its all-time high set last week.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 916 points, or 2.1%, and was above its last all-time high, which was set in December. The Nasdaq composite was up 2%, as of 1:25 p.m. Eastern time.\n\n\u201cKa-Powell\u201d is how Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management, described the reaction to Jerome Powell\u2019s highly anticipated speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. \u201cThe Fed isn\u2019t going to be the party-pooper.\u201d\n\nThe hope among investors had been that Powell would hint that the Fed\u2019s first cut to interest rates of the year may be imminent. Wall Street loves lower rates because they can give a boost to the economy and to investment prices, even if they risk worsening inflation at the same time.\n\nTrump has angrily been calling for lower rates, often insulting Powell while doing so. And a surprisingly weak report on job growth this month pushed many on Wall Street to assume cuts may come as soon as the Fed\u2019s next meeting in September.\n\nPowell encouraged them on Friday after saying he\u2019s seen risks rise for the job market. The Fed\u2019s two jobs are to keep the job market healthy and to keep a lid on inflation, and it often has to prioritize one because it has just one tool to fix either.\n\nBut Powell also would not commit to any kind of timing. He said the job market looks OK at the moment, even if \u201cit is a curious kind of balance\u201d where fewer new workers are chasing after fewer new jobs. Inflation, meanwhile, still has the potential to push higher because of Trump\u2019s tariffs.\n\nIn sum, Powell said that \u201cthe stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance.\u201d\n\nTreasury yields tumbled in the bond market as bets nevertheless built that the Fed would cut its main interest rate in September. Traders see an 87% chance of that, up from 75% a day earlier, according to data from CME Group.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.26% from 4.33% late Thursday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, sank to 3.68% from 3.79% in a notable move for the bond market.\n\nOn Wall Street, stocks of smaller companies led the way. They can benefit more from lower interest rates because of their need to borrow money to grow. The smaller stocks in the Russell 2000 index surged 3.9% toward its best day since April.\n\nHomebuilders jumped on hopes that easier interest rates could encourage more people to buy homes. Lennar, PulteGroup and D.R. Horton all rose at least 5%.\n\nTravel companies, meanwhile, climbed amid hopes that easier interest rates could help U.S. households spend more. Norwegian Cruise Line rallied 6.3%, Delta Air Lines flew 6.6% higher and Caesars Entertainment rose 6.3%.\n\nShares of Nio, a Chinese electric-vehicle maker, that trade in the United States leaped 16.8% after it began pre-sales of its flagship premium SUV model, the ES8.\n\nNvidia rose 1.8% to trim its loss for the week. The company, whose chips are powering much of the world\u2019s move in to artificial-intelligence technology, has seen its stock struggle recently amid criticism that it and other AI superstars shot too high, too fast and became too expensive.\n\nNvidia\u2019s CEO, Jensen Huang, said Friday that the company is discussing a potential new computer chip designed for China with the Trump administration. The chips are graphics processing units, or GPUs, a type of device used to build and update a range of AI systems. But they are less powerful than Nvidia\u2019s top semiconductors today, which cannot be sold to China due to U.S. national security restrictions.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, Germany\u2019s DAX returned 0.3% after government data showed that its economy shrank by 0.3% in the second quarter compared with the previous three-month period.\n\nIndexes rose across much of Asia, with stocks climbing 1.4% in Shanghai and 0.9% in South Korea.",

      "text": "Walmart helps pull Wall Street to its 5th straight loss\nWalmart helps pull Wall Street to its 5th straight loss\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Wall Street fell to a fifth straight loss on Thursday, hurt by a drop for Walmart and dampened hopes for coming cuts to interest rates.\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.4%. All its losses have been relatively modest, but it has not risen since setting an all-time high last Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 152 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.3%.\nWalmart was one of the market\u2019s heaviest weights and dropped 4.5% after reporting a profit for the spring that came up short of analysts\u2019 expectations, while Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks held a bit steadier following two days of sharp swings.\nThe moves were stronger in the bond market, where Treasury yields rose after a report forced Wall Street to scale back hopes that the Federal Reserve may soon deliver relief by cutting interest rates.\nU.S. stocks are falling after a weaker-than-expected profit report from a major retailer. The AP\u2019s Seth Sutel reports.\nThe report suggested growth in U.S. business activity is accelerating and hit its fastest rate so far this year. That\u2019s good news for the economy, but the preliminary data from S&P Global also said tariffs helped push up average selling prices at the fastest rate in three years. That\u2019s a discouraging sign for inflation.\nTaken all together, such data has historically aligned more with the Federal Reserve considering a hike in interest rates, rather than a cut, according to Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.\nNo one expects a rate hike to happen, but the overwhelming expectation on Wall Street has been for coming cuts. Traders are betting on a nearly three-in-four chance that the Fed will lower its main interest rate at its next meeting in September, according to data from CME Group. The hope on Wall Street has been that Fed Chair Jerome Powell may give hints on Friday that easier rates may be coming.\nHe will be speaking in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, at an annual conference of central bankers that\u2019s been home to big policy announcements in the past.\nA cut in interest rates would be the first of the year, and it would give investment prices and the economy a boost by potentially making it cheaper to borrow to buy cars or equipment. But it could also risk worsening inflation.\nThe Fed has been hesitant to cut interest rates this year out of fear that President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs could push inflation higher, but a surprisingly weak report on job growth earlier this month suddenly made the job market a bigger worry. Trump, meanwhile, has angrily pushed for cuts to interest rates, often insulting Powell while doing so.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury, which helps set rates for mortgages, rose to 4.32% from 4.29%. The two-year Treasury, which moves more on expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do with short-term interest rates, climbed to 3.78% from 3.74%.\nOn Wall Street, Walmart dropped even though it reported encouraging growth in revenue during the latest quarter and raised its forecast for profit over its full fiscal year.\nAnalysts said the market\u2019s expectations were high coming into the report. The Bentonville, Arkansas, company\u2019s stock came into the day with a gain of 13.5% for the year so far, more than the rest of the market.\nBig Tech stocks are under even more pressure to deliver bigger profits amid criticism that their stock prices ran too high, too fast and have become too expensive because of the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology.\nSeveral AI superstar stocks have swung sharply this week, taking some shine off their skyscraping surges for the year, because of such criticism. But they held a bit steadier on Thursday.\nPalantir Technologies, which at one point on Wednesday was on track to fall more than 9% for a second straight day before paring its loss, rose 0.1%. Nvidia, the chip company that\u2019s become the poster child of the AI boom, edged down 0.2%.\nCoty tumbled 21.6% after the beauty products company reported a loss for the latest quarter, when analysts expected a slight profit. The company, whose brands include CoverGirl and Joop!, said uncertainty about tariffs and the economy are making retailers cautious in their orders.\nOn the winning side of Wall Street was Nordson, which makes products and systems used for precision dispensing and other things. It delivered profit and revenue for the latest quarter that topped analysts\u2019 expectations, and its stock rose 3%.\nAll told, the S&P 500 slipped 25.61 points to 6,370.17. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 152.81 to 44,785.50, and the Nasdaq composite sank 72.55 to 21,100.31.\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed across much of Europe and Asia.\nGermany, Europe\u2019s largest economy, saw its DAX return 0.1% after U.S. and European Union officials offered a framework for their trade deal.\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell 0.6% after a survey showed Japan\u2019s factory activity contracted again in August.\n___\nAP Writers Teresa Cerojano and Matt Ott contributed."

      "text": "Nvidia\u2019s CEO says it\u2019s in talks with Trump administration on a new chip for China\nBANGKOK (AP) \u2014 Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Friday that the company is discussing a potential new computer chip designed for China with the Trump administration.\nHuang was asked about a possible \u201cB30A\u201d semiconductor for artificial intelligence data centers for China while on a visit to Taiwan, where he was meeting Nvidia\u2019s key manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., the world\u2019s largest chip maker.\n\u201cI\u2019m offering a new product to China for ... AI data centers, the follow-on to H20,\u201d Huang said. But he added that \u201cThat\u2019s not our decision to make. It\u2019s up to, of course, the United States government. And we\u2019re in dialogue with them, but it\u2019s too soon to know.\u201d\nSuch chips are graphics processing units, or GPUs, a type of device used to build and update a range of AI systems. But they are less powerful than Nvidia\u2019s top semiconductors today, which cannot be sold to China due to U.S. national security restrictions.\nThe B30A, based on California-based Nvidia\u2019s specialized Blackwell technology, is reported to operate at about half the speed of Nvidia\u2019s main B300 chips.\nHuang praised the the Trump administration for recently approving sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips to China after such business was suspended in April, with the proviso that the company must pay a 15% tax to the U.S. government on those sales. Chip maker Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, was told to pay the same tax on its sales of its MI380 chips to China.\nAs part of broader trade talks, Beijing and Washington recently agreed to pull back some non-tariff restrictions. China approved more permits for rare earth magnets to be exported to the U.S., while Washington lifted curbs on chip design software and jet engines. After lobbying by Huang, it also allowed sales of the H20 chips to go through.\nHuang did not comment directly on the tax when asked but said Nvidia appreciated being able to sell H20s to China.\nHe said such sales pose no security risk for the United States. Nvidia is also speaking with Beijing to reassure Chinese authorities that those chips do not pose a \u201cbackdoor\u201d security risk, Huang said.\n\u201cWe have made very clear and put to rest that H20 has no security backdoors. There are no such things. There never has. And so hopefully the response that we\u2019ve given to the Chinese government will be sufficient,\u201d he said.\nThe Cyberspace Administration of China, the country\u2019s internet watchdog, recently posted a notice on its website referring to alleged \u201cserious security issues\u201d with Nvidia\u2019s computer chips.\nIt said U.S. experts on AI had said such chips have \u201cmature tracking and location and remote shutdown technologies\u201d and Nvidia had been asked to explain any such risks and provide documentation about the issue.\nHuang said Nvidia was surprised by the accusation and was discussing the issue with Beijing.\n\u201cAs you know, they requested and urged us to secure licenses for the H20s for some time. And I\u2019ve worked quite hard to help them secure the licenses. And so hopefully this will be resolved,\u201d Huang said.\nUnconfirmed reports said Chinese authorities were also unhappy over comments by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggesting the U.S. was only selling outdated chips to China.\nSpeaking on CNBC, Lutnick said the U.S. strategy was to keep China reliant on American chip technology.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t sell them our best stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cNot our second best stuff. Not even our third best, but I think fourth best is where we\u2019ve come out that we\u2019re cool,\u201d he said.\nChina\u2019s ruling Communist Party has made self-reliance in advanced technology a strategic priority, though it still relies on foreign semiconductor knowhow for much of what it produces.\n___\nAP Videojournalist Taijing Wu in Taipei contributed to this report."

And the unemployment rate ticked higher to 4.2% as Americans dropped out of the labor force and the ranks of the unemployed rose by 221,000.\n\u201cA notable deterioration in U.S. labor market conditions appears to be underway,\u2019' said Scott Anderson, chief U.S. economist at BMO Capital Markets. \u201dWe have been forecasting this since the tariff and trade war erupted this spring and more restrictive immigration restrictions were put in place. Overall, this report highlights the risk of a harder landing for the labor market.\u2019'\nEconomists have been warning that the rift with every U.S. trading partner will begin to appear this summer and the Friday jobs report appeared to sound the bell.\n\u201cWe\u2019re finally in the eye of the hurricane,\u201d said Daniel Zhao, chief economist at Glassdoor. \u201cAfter months of warning signs, the July jobs report confirms that the slowdown isn\u2019t just approaching\u2014it\u2019s here.\u201d\nU.S. markets recoiled at the jobs report and the Dow tumbled more than 600 points Friday.\nAP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports on a sharp slowdown in hiring.\nBut President Donald Trump responded to the weak report by calling for the firing of Erika McEntarfer, the director of the Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics, which compiles the jobs numbers. \u201cI have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social. \u201cShe will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified.\u201d\nTrump questioned the big revisions, but they are a standard part of the monthly jobs report. The Labor Department revises its numbers as more data comes in. Particularly since COVID-19, businesses have taken longer to respond to the government\u2019s survey on hiring. As more data has come in later than in the past, the potential for large revisions has increased.\nRevelations in the new data raise questions about the health of the job market and the economy as Trump pushes forward an unorthodox overhaul of American trade policy.\nTrump has discarded decades of U.S. efforts to lower trade barriers globally, instead, imposing hefty import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on products from almost every country on earth. Trump believes the levies will bring manufacturing back to America and raise money to pay for the massive tax cuts he signed into law July 4.\nMainstream economists warned that the cost of the tariffs will be passed along to Americans, both businesses and households.\nThat has begun.\nWalmart, Procter & Gamble, Ford, Best Buy, Adidas, Nike, Mattel, Shein, Temu, Stanley Black & Decker, have all hiked prices due to U.S. tariffs. Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate that overseas exporters have absorbed just one-fifth of the rising costs from tariffs, while Americans and U.S. businesses have picked up the lion\u2019s share of the tab.\nTrump has sowed uncertainty in the erratic way he\u2019s rolled the tariffs out \u2014 announcing, then suspending them, then coming up with new ones. Overnight, Trump signed an executive order that set new tariffs on a wide swath of U.S. trading partners to that go into effect on Aug. 7, and that comes after a flurry of unexpected tariff-related actions this week.\n\u201cThere was a clear, significant, immediate, tariff effect on the labor market and employment growth essentially stalled, as we were dealing with so much uncertainty about the outlook for the economy and for tariffs,\u201d said Blerina Uruci, chief U.S. economist for the brokerage T. Rowe Price.\nStill, Uruci said the data suggests we could be past the worst, as hiring actually did pick up a bit in July from May and June\u2019s depressed levels.\n\u201cI\u2019m not overly pessimistic on the U.S. economy based on this morning\u2019s data,\u201d she said, though she does think that hiring will remain muted in the coming months as the number of available workers remains limited due to reduced immigration and an aging population.\n\u201cBecause of immigration policy, labor supply growth has nearly ground to a halt,\u201d said Guy Berger, senior fellow at the Burning Glass Institute, which studies employment trends. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to have very weak employment growth. And we look like southern Europe or Japan.\u201d\nStill, with fewer workers available, the economy doesn\u2019t need to generate many jobs to soak up the unemployed. That could keep the unemployment rate from climbing much, Berger added.\nTrump has sold the tariffs hikes as a way to boost American manufacturing, but factories cut 11,000 jobs last month after shedding 15,000 in June and 11,000 in May. The federal government, where employment has been targeted by the Trump administration, lost 12,000 jobs. Jobs in administration and support fell by nearly 20,000.\nHealthcare companies added 55,400 jobs last month \u2013 accounting for 76% of the jobs added in July and offering another sign that recent job gains have been narrowly concentrated.\nThe department originally reported that state and local governments had added 64,000 education jobs in June. The revisions Friday slashed those jobs to less than 10,000.\nThose revisions also revealed that the U.S. economy has generated an average of just 85,000 jobs a month this year, barely half last year\u2019s average of 168,000 and well below an average 400,000 from 2021-2023 as the economy rebounded from COVID-19 lockups.\nThe weak jobs data makes it more likely that Trump will get one thing that he most fervently desires: A cut in short-term interest rates by the Federal Reserve, which often -- though not always -- can lead to lower rates for mortgages, car loans, and credit cards.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials have repeatedly pointed to a healthy job market as a reason that they could take time to evaluate how Trump\u2019s tariffs were affecting inflation and the broader economy. Now that assessment has been undercut and will put more pressure on the Fed to reduce borrowing costs.\nWall Street investors sharply raised their expectations for a rate cut at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in September after the report was released.\nOn Wednesday, the Fed left its key rate unchanged for fifth consecutive meeting and Powell signaled little urgency to reduce rates anytime soon. He said the \u201clabor market is solid\u201d with \u201chistorically low unemployment.\u201d But he also acknowledged there is a \u201cdownside risk\u201d to employment stemming from the slow pace of hiring that was evident even before Friday\u2019s weaker numbers.\nThe current situation is a sharp reversal from the hiring boom of just three years ago when desperate employers were handing out signing bonuses and introducing perks such as Fridays off, fertility benefits and even pet insurance to recruit and keep workers.\nThe rate of people quitting their jobs \u2014 a sign they\u2019re confident they can land something better \u2014 has fallen from the record heights of 2021 and 2022 and is now weaker than before the pandemic.\nDrees Homes, a homebuilder based outside Cincinnati in Fort Mitchell, Kentucky, has hired about 50 people over the past year, bringing its workforce to around 950. Pamela Rader, Drees\u2019 vice president for human resources, it\u2019s \u201cgotten a little bit easier\u2019\u2019 to find workers.\nA couple of years ago, Rader said jobseekers were focused on getting more pay. Now, she said, they emphasize stable employment, a better work-life balance, and prospects for advancement."

      "text": "Most US stocks fall after a disappointing inflation update, but Big Tech keeps Wall Street steady\nMost US stocks fall after a disappointing inflation update, but Big Tech keeps Wall Street steady\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Most stocks fell on Wall Street Thursday after a disappointing report said inflation was worse last month at the U.S. wholesale level than economists expected. But gains for Amazon and some other influential Big Tech companies helped mask the losses.\nSeven out of every 10 stocks within the S&P 500 fell, though the index edged up by less than 0.1% to set another all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 11 points, or less than 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite dipped by less than 0.1% from its record set the day before.\nThe inflation report said that prices jumped 3.3% last month at the U.S. wholesale level from a year earlier. That was well above the 2.5% rate that economists had forecast, and it could hint at higher inflation ahead for U.S. shoppers as it makes its way through the system.\nThe data forced traders to second guess their widespread consensus that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next meeting in September. Lower rates can boost investment prices and the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and businesses to borrow to buy houses, cars or equipment, but they also risk worsening inflation.\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t slam the door on a September rate cut,\u201d but it may raise some doubt, according to Chris Larkin, managing director, trading and investing, at E-Trade from Morgan Stanley.\nMost stocks fell on Wall Street after a report showed inflation was worse last month at the U.S. wholesale level than economists expected.\nTraders now see a 7.4% chance that the Fed may hold rates steady in September, according to data from CME Group. A day earlier, they were betting on a 100% certainty that the Fed would cut its main rate for the first time this year.\nHigher interest rates drag on all kinds of companies by keeping the cost to borrow high. They can hurt smaller companies in particular because they often need to borrow to grow. The Russell 2000 index of smaller U.S. stocks tumbled a market-leading 1.2%.\nThursday\u2019s disappointing data followed an encouraging update earlier in the week on prices at the consumer level. A separate report on Thursday, meanwhile, said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week. That\u2019s a good sign for workers, indicating that layoffs remain relatively low at a time when job openings have become more difficult to find.\nBut a solid job market could also give the Fed less reason to cut interest rates in the short term.\nThe data helped send Treasury yields higher in the bond market. The yield on the 10-year Treasury climbed to 4.28% from 4.20% just before the data reports\u2019 release and from 4.24% late Wednesday.\nOn Wall Street, Tapestry tumbled after the company behind the Coach and Kate Spade New York brands showed it\u2019s feeling the pressure of tariffs.\nIt detailed how much profit it could lose in its upcoming fiscal year because of tariffs and duties, and its forecast for profit fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations even though its forecast for revenue came in above. Its stock fell 15.7%, despite it also reporting a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected.\nDeere fell 6.8% even though the machinery maker likewise delivered a better profit than expected. There, too, the focus was on where profits are heading. It cut the top end of its forecasted range for profit this fiscal year and said its customers \u201cremain cautious amid ongoing uncertainty.\u201d\nOn the winning side of Wall Street was Fossil Group, which jumped 29.8% after the seller of watches and other accessories reported better profit than expected. It also announced a plan to strengthen its finances, while trimming its forecast for how much it expects worldwide net sales to fall this year.\nBig Tech stocks also helped mask Wall Street\u2019s losses. Amazon rose 2.9% to add to its gains from the prior day when it announced same-day delivery of fresh groceries in more than 1,000 cities and towns.\nBecause Amazon is so huge, with a market value of $2.45 trillion, the movements for its stock carry much more weight on the S&P 500 than the typical company\u2019s.\nAll told, the S&P 500 rose 1.96 to 6,468.54 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged down 11.01 to 44,911.26, and the Nasdaq composite dipped 2.47 to 21.710.67.\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed across Asia and Europe ahead of a key meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday.\n___\nAP Writers Teresa Cerojano and Matt Ott contributed."

Demand for GPUs from the top four cloud service providers is surging, he said, adding that he expects Nvidia\u2019s data center infrastructure revenue to hit $1 trillion by 2028.\nHuang\u2019s highly anticipated announcement revealed more details around Nvidia\u2019s next-generation graphics architectures: Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin -- named for the famous astronomer. Blackwell Ultra is slated for the second half of 2025, while its successor, the Rubin AI chip, is expected to launch in late 2026. Rubin Ultra will take the stage in 2027.\nIn a talk that lasted at over two hours, Huang outlined the \u201cextraordinary progress\u201d that AI has made. In 10 years, he said, AI graduated from perception and \u201ccomputer vision\u201d to generative AI, and now to agentic AI \u2014 or AI that has the ability to reason.\n\u201cAI understands the context, understands what we\u2019re asking. Understands the meaning of our request,\u201d he said. \u201cIt now generates answers. Fundamentally changed how computing is done.\u201d\nThe next wave of AI, he said, is already happening: robotics.\nRobotics fueled by so-called \u201cphysical AI\u201d can understand concepts like friction and inertia, cause and effect, and object permanence, he said.\n\u201cEach one of these phases, each one of these waves, opens up new market opportunities for all of us,\u201d Huang said.\nThe key to that physical AI, and many of Huang\u2019s other announcements, was the concept of using synthetic data generation \u2014 AI or computer-created data \u2014 for model training. AI needs digital experiences to learn from, he said, and it learns at speeds that make using humans in the training loops obsolete.\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so much data and so much human demonstration we can perform,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the big breakthrough in the last couple of years: reinforcement learning.\u201d\nNvidia\u2019s tech, he said, can help with that type of learning for AI as it attacks or tries to engage in solving a problem, step by step.\nTo that end, Huang announced Isaac GR00T N1, an open-source foundation model designed to assist in developing humanoid robots. Isaac GR00T N1 would be paired with an updated Cosmos AI model to help develop simulated training data for robots.\nBenjamin Lee, a professor of electrical and systems engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, said that the challenge in training robotics lies in data collection because training in the real world is time-consuming and expensive.\nA simulated environment has long been a standard for reinforcement learning, Lee said, so researchers can test the effectiveness of their models.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really exciting. Providing a platform, and an open-source one, will allow more people to learn on reinforcement learning,\u201d Lee said. \u201cMore researchers could start playing with this synthetic data \u2014 not just big players in the industry but also academic researchers.\u201d\nHuang introduced the Cosmos series of AI models, which can generate cost-efficient photo-realistic video that can then be used to train robots and other automated services, at CES earlier this year.\nThe open-source model, which works with the Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse \u2014 a physics simulation tool \u2014 to create more realistic video, promises to be much cheaper than traditional forms of gathering training, such as having cars record road experiences or having people teach robots repetitive tasks.\nU.S. car maker General Motors plans to integrate Nvidia technology in its new fleet of self-driving cars, Huang said. The two two companies will work together to build custom AI systems using both Omniverse and Cosmos to train AI manufacturing models.\nThe Nvidia head also unveiled the company\u2019s Halos system, an AI solution built around automotive \u2014 especially autonomous driving \u2014 safety.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the first company in the world, I believe, to have every line of code safety assessed,\u201d Huang said.\nAt the end of his talk, Huang an open-source physics engine for robotics simulation called Newton, which is being developed with Google DeepMind and Disney Research.\nA small, boxy robot named Blue joined him on stage, popping up from a hatch in the floor. It beeped at Huang and followed his commands, standing beside him as he wrapped up his thoughts.\n\u201cThe age of generalist robotics is here,\u201d Huang said."

      "text": "Powell to give his last Jackson Hole speech under watchful gaze of Wall Street and the White House\nWatch live as U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivers a high-profile address at the annual Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium.\n\u25b6 Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Just three weeks ago, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke to reporters after the central bank had kept its key interest rate unchanged for a fifth straight meeting and said the job market was \u201csolid.\u201d\nHis assessment was important because if the job market is healthy, there is less need for the Fed to cut its key interest rate, as President Donald Trump has demanded. Two days later, the Labor Department issued a report that cast doubt on that assessment, showing hiring was weak in July and much lower than previously estimated in May and June.\nSo, there will be a lot of attention paid by Wall Street and the White House to Powell\u2019s high-profile speech Friday at the Fed\u2019s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. If the famously data-dependent Powell shifts gears and takes a gloomier view of the job market, that could open the door for a rate cut at the Fed\u2019s next meeting in September.\nPowell could also stick to the cautious approach he\u2019s maintained all year and reiterate that the central bank needs more time to evaluate the impact of Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs on inflation.\nMost economists expect Powell to signal that a rate cut is likely this year, but won\u2019t necessarily commit to one next month. That could disappoint Wall Street, which has put high odds on a September cut.\nPowell\u2019s speech, his last address at Jackson Hole as chair before his term ends in May, will occur against a particularly fraught backdrop. About a week after the jobs numbers, the latest inflation report showed that price growth crept higher in July. Core prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, rose 3.1% from a year ago, above the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\nStubbornly elevated inflation pushes the Fed in the opposite direction that weak hiring does: It suggests the central bank\u2019s short-term rate should stay at its current 4.3%, rather than be cut. That would mean other borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and business loans, would stay elevated.\n\u201cSo the plot has thickened,\u201d said David Wilcox, a former top Fed economist and now director of economic research at Bloomberg Economics and also a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute. \u201cThe dilemma that the Fed is in has become, if anything, more intense.\u201d\nPowell is also navigating an unprecedented level of public criticism by Trump, as well as efforts by the president to take greater control of the Fed, which has long been independent from day-to-day politics.\nMost observers credit Powell for his nimble handling of the pressures. An iconic moment in his tenure was Trump\u2019s visit to tour the Fed\u2019s renovation of its office buildings last month. Trump had charged that Powell mismanaged the project, which had ballooned in cost to $2.5 billion, from an earlier estimate of $1.9 billion.\nWith both the president and Fed chair in white hard hats on the building site, in front of cameras, Trump claimed the cost had mushroomed even further to $3.1 trillion. Powell shook his head, so Trump handed him a piece of paper purporting to back up his claim.\nPowell calmly dismissed the figure, noting that the $3.1 billion included the cost of renovating a third building five years earlier.\n\u201cThat was just such a classic Powell,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG. \u201cHe just doesn\u2019t get fazed. He\u2019s got a humility that oftentimes I think is lacking among my colleagues in economics.\u201d\nPowell appeared to at least temporarily assuage Trump during the tour, after which the president backed off his threats to fire the Fed chair over the project.\nThe attacks from Trump are the latest challenges for Powell in an unusually tumultuous eight years as Fed chair. Not long after being appointed by Trump in 2018, Powell endured the president\u2019s criticisms as the Fed slowly raised its key rate from the low levels where it had remained for years after the 2008-2009 Great Recession.\nPowell then found himself grappling with the pandemic, and after that the worst inflation spike in four decades that occurred as government stimulus checks fueled spending while crippled supply chains left fewer goods available.\nPowell then oversaw a rapid series of rate hikes that were widely predicted to cause a recession, but the economy continued plugging ahead.\nIn his latest attempt to pressure the Fed, on Wednesday Trump called on Fed governor Lisa Cook to step down, after an administration official, Bill Pulte, accused her of mortgage fraud. Pulte is head of the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\nCook said in a statement that she wouldn\u2019t be \u201cbullied\u201d into resigning and added that she was preparing to answer the charges.\nFor Powell, there\u2019s a difficult decision to make on interest rates. The Fed\u2019s \u201cdual mandate\u201d calls for it to keep prices stable while seeking maximum employment. But while the weak jobs data suggest the need for a cut, many Fed officials fear inflation will get worse in the coming months.\n\u201cThere is still a fair amount that\u2019s still outstanding,\u201d Raphael Bostic, president of the Fed\u2019s Atlanta branch, said in an interview, referring to tariff-led price hikes. \u201cOne feedback we\u2019ve gotten both in our surveys and from direct conversations (with businesses) suggests that many still are looking to see the price that they charge their customers increase from where we are today.\u201d\nOther economists, however, point to the sharp slowdown in housing as a sign of a weak economy. The housing market remains mired in a slump partly due to elevated mortgage rates, even though sales of existing homes did rise in July. Consumer spending has also been modest this year, and growth was just 1.2% at an annual rate in the first half of 2025.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot to like about the economy right now outside of AI,\u201d said Neil Dutta, an economist at Renaissance Macro. \u201cThe weakness in the economy isn\u2019t about tariffs,\u201d but instead the Fed\u2019s high rates, he added."

Here\u2019s what they are, what they\u2019re for and why investors see gold\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 The hottest thing in technology is an unprepossessing sliver of silicon closely related to the chips that power video game graphics. It\u2019s an artificial intelligence chip, designed specifically to make building AI systems such as ChatGPT faster and cheaper.\nSuch chips have suddenly taken center stage in what some experts consider an AI revolution that could reshape the technology sector \u2014 and possibly the world along with it. Shares of Nvidia, the leading designer of AI chips, rocketed up almost 25% last Thursday after the company forecast a huge jump in revenue that analysts said indicated soaring sales of its products. The company was briefly worth more than $1 trillion on Tuesday.\nSO WHAT ARE AI CHIPS, ANYWAY?\nThat isn\u2019t an easy question to answer. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t a completely agreed upon definition of AI chips,\u201d said Hannah Dohmen, a research analyst with the Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\nIn general, though, the term encompasses computing hardware that\u2019s specialized to handle AI workloads \u2014 for instance, by \u201ctraining\u201d AI systems to tackle difficult problems that can choke conventional computers.\nVIDEO GAME ORIGINS\nThree entrepreneurs founded Nvidia in 1993 to push the boundaries of computational graphics. Within a few years, the company had developed a new chip called a graphics processing unit, or GPU, which dramatically sped up both development and play of video games by performing multiple complex graphics calculations at once.\nThat technique, known formally as parallel processing, would prove key to the development of both games and AI. Two graduate students at the University of Toronto used a GPU-based neural network to win a prestigious 2012 AI competition called ImageNet by identifying photo images at much lower error rates than competitors.\nThe win kick-started interest in AI-related parallel processing, opening a new business opportunity for Nvidia and its rivals while providing researchers powerful tools for exploring the frontiers of AI development.\nMODERN AI CHIPS\nEleven years later, Nvidia is the dominant supplier of chips for building and updating AI systems. One of its recent products, the H100 GPU, packs in 80 billion transistors \u2014 about 13 million more than Apple\u2019s latest high-end processor for its MacBook Pro laptop. Unsurprisingly, this technology isn\u2019t cheap; at one online retailer, the H100 lists for $30,000.\nNvidia doesn\u2019t fabricate these complex GPU chips itself, a task that would require enormous investments in new factories. Instead it relies on Asian chip foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics.\nSome of the biggest customers for AI chips are cloud-computing services such as those run by Amazon and Microsoft. By renting out their AI computing power, those services make it possible for smaller companies and groups that couldn\u2019t afford to build their own AI systems from scratch to use cloud-based tools to help with tasks that can range from drug discovery to customer management.\nOTHER USES AND COMPETITION\nParallel processing has many uses outside of AI. A few years ago, for instance, Nvidia graphics cards were in short supply because cryptocurrency miners, who set up banks of computers to solve thorny mathematical problems for bitcoin rewards, had snapped up most of them. That problem faded as the cryptocurrency market collapsed in early 2022.\nAnalysts say Nvidia will inevitably face tougher competition. One potential rival is Advanced Micro Devices, which already faces off with Nvidia in the market for computer graphics chips. AMD has recently taken steps to bolster its own lineup of AI chips.\nNvidia is based in Santa Clara, California. Co-founder Jensen Huang remains the company\u2019s president and chief executive."

      "text": "Trump\u2019s latest tariff deadline is approaching. Here are the trade deals the US has announced so far\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The clock is ticking closer to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s latest tariff deadline of Aug 1. And while several more deals \u2014 or at least frameworks for deals \u2014 have been reached since his last tariff deadline of July 9 came and went, trade talks with many countries are still in flux.\nTrump unveiled sweeping import taxes on goods coming into the U.S. from nearly every country back in April. That included heightened so-called reciprocal rates for certain countries, the bulk of which have since been postponed twice.\nThe first 90-day pause arrived in an apparent effort to quell global market panic and facilitate country-by-country negotiations, with the Trump administration at one point setting a lofty goal of reaching 90 trade deals in 90 days.\nBut three months later, only two deals emerged: with the U.K. and Vietnam. A separate \u201cframework\u201d for a deal was hashed out with China. And by early July, Trump began sending warning letters that higher tariffs would be imposed against dozens of countries on Aug. 1.\nSince then, the U.S. has announced more trade frameworks. But, many key details remain sparse \u2014 or not immediately captured in writing.\nHere\u2019s what we know about the agreements so far, in the order of those most recently announced.\nPakistan\nThe U.S. and Pakistan reached a trade agreement expected to allow Washington to help develop Pakistan\u2019s largely untapped oil reserves and lower tariffs for the South Asian country, officials from both nations said Thursday.\nOfficials did not specify where the exploration would take place \u2014 and in a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said \u201cwe are in the process of choosing the oil company that will lead this partnership.\u201d\nPakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the \u201clong-awaited\u201d deal and thanked Trump for playing a key role in finalizing it. Pakistan\u2019s Finance Ministry said the agreement aims to boost bilateral trade, expand market access, attract investment and foster cooperation in areas of mutual interest.\nThe deal includes a reduction in reciprocal tariffs, particularly on Pakistani exports to the U.S., the statement from the ministry said. A new figure wasn\u2019t immediately provided.\nSouth Korea\nTrump on Wednesday said the U.S. reached an agreement with Seoul on July 30 that would impose a 15% tariff for goods from South Korea.\nThe two countries have also agreed for South Korea to buy $100 billion in energy resources from the U.S. and for South Korea to give to the U.S. $350 billion for \u201cinvestments owned and controlled by the United States, and selected by myself, as president,\u201d Trump said.\nSouth Korean president Lee Jae Myung later added that the $350 billion investment fund is meant to solidify a foundation for bilateral cooperation on strategic industries \u2014 noting that the fund will support South Korean companies\u2019 entrance to the U.S. market in areas such as shipbuilding, semiconductors, secondary batteries, biotechnology and energy.\nEuropean Union\nThe U.S. and the EU announced a trade framework that imposes 15% tariffs on most European goods \u2014 warding off Trump\u2019s most recent threat of 30% if no deal had been reached by Aug. 1.\nBut some key details require more work. The headline of the agreement, unveiled July 27, is that the 15% tariff rate will apply to 70% of European goods brought into the U.S. \u2014 with the EU later confirming that that rate applies to pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and car and car parts. But the remaining 30% of those imports is still open for negotiations.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that both sides had agreed to zero tariffs for a range of \u201cstrategic\u201d goods. Meanwhile, Trump pointed to heightened investments from European companies in the U.S. \u2014 including what Trump said was $750 billion (638 billion euros) worth of natural gas, oil and nuclear fuel over three years, as well as an additional $600 billion (511 billion euros) under a political commitment that isn\u2019t legally binding, officials said.\nJapan\nOn July 22, Trump announced a trade framework to impose 15% tariffs on Japan \u2014 down from his previously-threatened rate of 25%. The U.S. president also said Japan would invest $550 billion into the U.S. and would \u201copen\u201d its economy to American autos and rice.\nThe newly-agreed on 15% tariff rate also applies to Japanese cars \u2014 marking a welcome relief for automakers like Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda \u2014 which, like other automakers, have faced a 25% levy on key parts and finished vehicles going into the U.S. since earlier this year. But car companies in other countries, including U.S. competitors, worry that this could put them at a disadvantage.\nPhilippines\nShortly after a July 22 meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., Trump announced that he would lower his upcoming tariffs on imports from the country to 19% \u2014 down just 1% from his previous threat of 20%.\nIn return, Trump said on Truth Social, the U.S. would not pay tariffs on American goods it shipped to the Philippines. But additional details remained unclear. Marcos said his country was considering options such as having an open market without tariffs for U.S. automobiles, but emphasized details were still left to be worked out.\nIndonesia\nOn July 15, Trump again took to social media to announce that he\u2019s agreed to lower his planned tariffs on Indonesian goods to 19% \u2014 down from a previously-threatened levy of 32% \u2014 while American goods sent to the southeast Asian country will face no tariffs. A fact sheet from the White House later confirmed that \u201cover 99% of U.S. products\u201d exported to Indonesia would be sent duty-free.\nIndonesian President Prabowo Subianto said he will continue to negotiate with Trump, in hopes of further lowering the coming U.S. tariffs.\nVietnam\nOn July 2, Trump announced a trade deal with Vietnam that he said would allow U.S. goods to enter the country duty-free. Vietnamese exports to the U.S., by contrast, would face a 20% levy.\nThat\u2019s less than half the 46% \u201creciprocal\u201d rate Trump proposed for Vietnamese goods back in April. But in addition to the new 20% tariff rate, Trump said the U.S. would impose a 40% tax on \u201ctransshipping\u2019\u2019 \u2014 targeting goods from another country that stop in Vietnam on their way to the United States. Washington complains that Chinese goods have been dodging higher U.S. tariffs by transiting through Vietnam.\nUnited Kingdom\nOn May 8, Trump agreed to cut tariffs on British autos, steel and aluminum, among other trade pledges \u2014 while the U.K. promised to reduce levies on U.S. products like olive oil, wine and sports equipment. The deal was announced in grandiose terms by both countries, but some key details remained unknown for weeks.\nWhen the deal was announced, for example, the British government notably said that the U.S. agreed to exempt the U.K. from its then-universal 25% duties on foreign steel and aluminum \u2014 which would have effectively allowed both metals from the country to come into the U.S. duty-free.\nBut the timing for when those cuts would actually take effect stayed up in the air for almost a month. It wasn\u2019t until early June, when Trump hiked his steel and aluminum tariffs to a punishing 50% worldwide, that the U.S. acknowledged it was time to implement the agreement. And even then, U.S. tariffs on British steel and aluminum did not go to zero. The U.K. was the only country spared from Trump\u2019s new 50% levies, but still faces 25% import taxes on the metals.\nChina\nAt its peak, Trump\u2019s new tariffs on Chinese goods totaled 145% \u2014 and China\u2019s countertariffs on American products reached 125%. But on May 12, the countries agreed to their own 90-day truce to roll back those levies to 30% and 10%, respectively. And in June, details began trickling in about a tentative trade agreement.\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that China had agreed to make it easier for American firms to acquire Chinese magnets and rare earth minerals critical for manufacturing and microchip production. Meanwhile, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said that the U.S. would \u201clift a series of restrictive measures it had imposed on China.\u201d\nOther key details of the deal remain murky \u2014 including the timing of implementation for these terms. On July 29, China\u2019s top trade official said the two sides had agreed to work on extending an Aug. 12 deadline for new tariffs on each other, following a two-day trade meeting in Stockholm. The U.S. side said extension plans were discussed, but not decided.\n_________\nAssociated Press reporters from all over the world contributed to this report."

      "text": "German economy shrank by 0.3% in second quarter in worse showing than initially thought\nBERLIN (AP) \u2014 The German economy shrank by 0.3% in the second quarter compared with the previous three-month period, official data showed Friday, a significantly worse showing than was initially reported as tensions with the U.S. over tariffs simmered.\nIn a preliminary report at the end of July, the Federal Statistical Office said gross domestic product contracted by 0.1% in April-June compared with the first quarter for Europe\u2019s biggest economy. That contributed to a lackluster showing for the 20-nation eurozone.\nFull data showed output in manufacturing and the construction industry was worse than expected in June and household spending for the quarter also was revised downward, the office said Friday. The decline followed growth of 0.3% in the first quarter.\nThe German economy has shrunk for the past two years. Chancellor Friedrich Merz\u2019s administration has made revitalizing it a top priority since taking office May 6.\nIt has launched a program to encourage investment and set up a 500 billion-euro ($582 billion) fund to pour money into Germany\u2019s creaking infrastructure over the next 12 years. It is promising to cut red tape and speed up the country\u2019s lagging digitization.\nA group of dozens of companies last month pledged to invest at least 631 billion euros ($731.7 billion) in Germany over the next three years, a figure that included some previously planned investments but was designed to send a signal of confidence in the economy.\nING economist Carsten Brzeski said \u201cafter the surge in economic activity resulting from the U.S. front-loading of German exports in the first quarter, the economy experienced a reversal of the front-loading effect, and the first full-blown impact of U.S. tariffs (implemented in the second quarter) took effect.\u201d\nIt could \u201ctake until next year before a more substantial recovery starts to unfold,\u201d he said.\nA European Union-U.S. trade deal was reached last month but remains a work in progress."

  "argos_summary": "Wall Street surged on Friday as investors reacted to Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s hint that rate cuts could come, lifting the S&P 500 1.6%, the Dow 2.1% and the Nasdaq 2%. Treasury yields fell as expectations of a September cut rose, and smaller\u2011cap stocks, homebuilders and travel firms led the gains. Nvidia and other AI\u2011chip makers also saw gains amid optimism over AI demand, while the rally was tempered by concerns over Trump\u2019s tariffs and weaker job data. The rally marked the best day in months for the market, pushing major indices toward new all\u2011time highs.",
