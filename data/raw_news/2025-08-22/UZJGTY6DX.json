The MLB star jokingly pointed to his wife\u2019s bare baby bump.\nHudgens and Tucker\u2019s celebrity friends toasted the forthcoming arrival in the comments.\n\u201cOmg!!!!!!!! Congrats,\u201d fellow Disney Channel alum Aly Michalka replied, while Allison Holker and Alexandra Shipp each sent a flurry of red heart emojis.\nJenna Dewan, for her part, added, \u201cOhhhhh congratulations my love!!\u201d\nHudgens\u2019 former Broadway costar Corey Cott also responded, commenting, \u201cCongrats V!\u201d\nNearly two weeks before sharing her pregnancy news, Hudgens called Tucker her \u201cbest friend\u201d in a birthday tribute.\n\u201cHappy birthday to my best friend/lover/partner in life,\u201d she wrote via Instagram on July 3. \u201c@cotuck you\u2019re everything to meeeeeee.

They tied the knot three years later in an intimate ceremony held in Tulum, Mexico.\n\u201cI also knew I wanted to get married somewhere warm, and our window for getting married was so small because Cole\u2019s [baseball] season is very long,\u201d she recalled to Vogue in 2023. \u201cI felt like \u2018Mexico it is!\u2019 I also wanted somewhere very spiritual. So I went to the hotel and got a really long tour, where I myself was not doing well, I was so hot and felt like I was going to faint. At the end of this very long tour, I was like \u2018Where would we have our ceremony?\u2019 and they were like \u2018Oh, that would be at our museum\u2019 and they said, \u2018It\u2019s 45 minutes into the jungle.\u2019 I was thinking, \u2018Okay, that sounds aggressive, but I guess I\u2019ll give it a try.\u2019\u201d\nShe added, \u201cI felt like I was transported to some kind of utopia, unlike anything I had ever been to before. It was whimsical and magical, and I just fell in love.\u201d\nHudgens revealed the next year that she was pregnant with the couple\u2019s first child, debuting her baby bump at the 2024 Oscars.
