  "description": "Officials said officers administered life-saving measures before rushing the two-time convicted violent felon to Kings County Hospital.",
  "content": "According to police, NYPD officers shot 22-year-old Edynesson Bauduy after interrupting a gunfight around 7:33 p.m. Tuesday, near Ocean Ave. and Church Ave. in Prospect Park South. Assistant Chief Frank Giordano said officers on patrol heard gunshots and saw two individuals engaged in a shootout. After exiting their vehicle, officers drew their weapons and shot at the man closest to them, hitting him at least once.\n\nGiordano said officers recovered a Ruger 9mm handgun and multiple shell casings at the scene. Below is a picture of the firearm recovered from the scene of today\u2019s incident in the @NYPD70Pct. https://t.co/TbD7v0y87g pic.twitter.com/73YRXDV47Q\u2014 NYPD NEWS (@NYPDnews) August 13, 2025 Officers on the scene performed CPR on the suspect before he was rushed to Kings County Hospital, where he remains in stable condition, police said.\n\nGiordano said Bauduy is a \"two-time convicted violent felon\" who was released from prison less than two months ago and remains on parole until 2030. He was first arrested in 2021 at age 18 for a shooting in Brooklyn. Giordano detailed that while that case was pending, Bauduy was released from custody but was later arrested for a violent commercial robbery in South Brooklyn. He pleaded guilty to both charges, received a concurrent sentence, and was released from prison just two months ago on June 10, according to police.\n\n\"If he received a consecutive sentence for his two distinct violent crimes, he would not be out on the street's right now, involved in yet another shooting that endangers our public,\" Giordano said. \"This is a person who has repeatedly shrugged his shoulders at consequences and at our criminal justice system for these violent crimes that he committed.\" Giordano said the incident is still under investigation, with the officers who discharged their weapons taken to the hospital for an evaluation.",
