      "summary": "American Resources Corporation has repurposed a shuttered television factory in eastern Kentucky into a high‑tech plant that extracts and refines rare earth elements from recycled industrial waste using its proprietary ReElement process. CEO Mark Jensen highlights the company’s 15‑year lead in a nascent domestic industry, producing high‑purity neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium for smartphones, electric vehicles, and defense systems. The facility demonstrates a clean, U.S.‑based alternative to China‑dominated mining, aligning with federal and congressional priorities to secure critical materials supply chains. By turning existing waste into magnet‑grade rare earths, the company aims to reduce reliance on foreign imports and support national security and technological innovation.",
