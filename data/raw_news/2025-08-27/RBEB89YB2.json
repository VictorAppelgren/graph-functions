  "description": "New trial results show that intense gum disease treatment reduces how much the carotid artery narrows in otherwise healthy individuals. This suggests oral health should be taken seriously as a contributing factor in cardiovascular disease.",
  "content": "Research has long pointed to a link between poor gum health and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease \u2014 and now, a new trial suggests that treating severe gum disease may reduce the narrowing of a major artery over time in otherwise healthy people.\n\nLikely by reducing , this routine oral hygiene procedure may be an unsung way of minimizing declines in blood vessel functioning.\n\n\"I was very overwhelmed when I looked at the data the first time,\" study co-author , a clinical research periodontist at University College London, told Live Science.\n\nAround ages 30 and older have some level of gum disease, known as , a chronic inflammatory condition whose progression leads to wobbly teeth, tooth loss and persistent bad breath. As the disease worsens, small pockets around the teeth that cannot be reached by a toothbrush or floss expand and fill with and bacteria.\n\nThere is now an abundance of research linking periodontitis to a higher risk of various health outcomes, including , and . A key area with mounting evidence is the association between severe gum disease and , with previous studies finding that the management of gum disease is linked to improved blood vessel function.\n\nNow, a clinical trial published Aug. 19 in the has found that treating periodontitis slows the thickening of the inner two layers of the carotid arteries, found on each side of the neck, in otherwise healthy adults. The thickness of those artery walls is a .\n\nBy targeting inflammation rather than other artery health factors, like cholesterol, \"the impact of what we are doing comes without going through the classic risk pathway\" for cardiovascular disease, Orlandi said.\n\nTo test whether treating periodontitis actually causes the carotid arteries to thicken less over time, Orlandi and his team of periodontists and cardiologists conducted a gold-standard trial at a dental hospital in central London. The trial was randomized, meaning participants were randomly placed in a treatment group or a comparison group that didn't receive the intensive gum treatment.\n\nFirst, the researchers took ultrasounds of the carotid arteries of 135 people with severe periodontitis, to establish a baseline level of thickness. They also measured how much the arteries dilated when blood flow increased \u2014 a measure of blood vessel functioning \u2014 and took blood samples to pinpoint markers of inflammatory and . All of the individuals were healthy besides having gum disease.\n\nNext, the participants were randomly divided into either the treatment group or the control group. Care was taken to ensure there was a roughly even split between the two groups in terms of the participants' periodontitis severity, smoking status and family history of cardiovascular disease.\n\nIn the treatment group, patients received intensive periodontitis treatment: a thorough clean of the whole mouth and a deep clean below the gumline to remove plaque and tartar. The control group received a simple scale and polish, more akin to a regular dental cleaning that doesn't include a deep clean of the gums.\n\nThe participants were then followed for two years, and they each received further dental treatments at regular intervals throughout that time. The researchers also reassessed the carotid artery at the one-year and two-year marks, and took blood samples and measured blood-vessel function at five time points.\n\nThey found that the thickness of the carotid arteries' innermost linings was lower for individuals who received intensive treatment than for those in the control group. This difference was \"comparable to what has been seen with lifestyle interventions and some pharmacological agents in similar populations,\" study co-author , a clinical research periodontist at University College London, told Live Science in an email.\n\nThe treated patients also had better blood vessel function and lower levels of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in their blood, which are known to contribute to the narrowing of artery walls \u2014 a condition called .\n\nAlthough many factors drive atherosclerosis, \"our results reinforce the view that untreated periodontitis is a modifiable risk factor for vascular ageing and possibly cardiovascular events,\" D'Aiuto said.\n\nHowever, a key limitation of the research is that it was conducted in only one location, so there is a chance that the findings partly come down to quirks of the location or the people in the sample, Orlandi said.\n\nAnother limitation, said , a clinical and research periodontist at the University of Hong Kong who was not involved in the research, is that all of the participants in the trial were healthy other than having periodontitis. As such, these results should not be interpreted as evidence that if someone with atherosclerosis has their gum disease treated, the health of their arteries will improve, he told Live Science.\n\nEven so, the findings \"are bringing the concept of these [intensive gum disease] interventions into the preservation of wellness,\" Tonetti said.\n\n\"For many, many years, dentists have been focusing on the teeth, forgetting the rest of the body, and physicians have been focusing on the body, forgetting that there are teeth,\" he said. \"They are really two worlds that have been separated and need to go back together for the benefit of patients.\"",

      "text": "Oral Health and Colorectal Cancer Risk?\nIn a study, researchers found an association between periodontal disease, tooth loss, and conditions associated with colorectal cancer.\nCould the health of your mouth and your teeth have anything to do with your chances of developing colorectal cancer? New research suggests the answer may be \u201cyes.\u201d\nEvidence has been building that the presence of periodontal disease is associated with several types of cancer. Scientists at Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital focused their attention on colorectal cancer, the second-leading cause of cancer death (after lung cancer) in the United States.\nThe researchers examined two conditions that often serve as precursors to colorectal cancer: benign tumors called adenomas, and tiny growths known as serrated polyps because they have a sawtooth appearance under the microscope. Using a large, long-term database of healthcare workers who volunteered information (on an anonymous basis), the researchers compared diagnosis of these conditions to the presence of periodontal diseases and loss of teeth.\nOverall, people who had periodontal disease had a 17 percent higher risk of developing serrated polyps or conventional adenomas. Those who had lost four or more teeth had a 20 percent higher risk of developing serrated polyps.\nThe more teeth a person lost, the higher risk they had of advanced conventional adenomas. Those who had lost one to three teeth had a 28 percent higher chance of developing advanced conventional adenomas, while those who had lost four or more teeth had a 36 percent higher risk.\nWhat\u2019s the connection between the mouth and the colon?\n\u201cThe oral cavity harbors a wide array of microbial communities,\u201d said Mingyang Song, MD, ScD, assistant professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \u201cVarious factors, including poor oral hygiene, genetic susceptibility, smoking, diabetes, and obesity, can result in an excess of oral pathogens that may induce host inflammation and immune dysregulation.\u201d\nWhat does it mean for people concerned about their risk of cancer?\n\u201cHaving ever been diagnosed with periodontal disease puts a person at risk of colorectal precursor lesions, some of which may eventually lead to colorectal cancer,\u201d Song said. \u201cRegular screening colonoscopy and lifestyle modifications are particularly important in this population.\u201d\nWhat can you do?\nExperts say you can improve your chance of avoiding periodontal disease by brushing your teeth after meals, flossing at least once a day, using mouthwash, and getting regular care from a dentist or periodontist."

      "text": "Scientists gave mice flu vaccines by flossing their tiny teeth \u2014 and it worked\nIn a proof-of-concept study, scientists have shown that flossing your teeth could be a way to deliver vaccinations that protect you against viruses.\nScientists have developed a new, needle-free way to deliver vaccines: through the gumline.\nIn a new proof-of-concept study, researchers successfully vaccinated mice against influenza by cleaning their teeth with dental floss coated with inactive flu viruses.\nMost vaccines are administered using a needle, an approach that has its drawbacks. For example, apprehension about pain from the injection and needle phobias can deter people from getting vaccinated. Additionally, injections require more medical expertise to administer than needle-free options, like mouth drops or nasal sprays, and are more challenging to store and distribute.\nBut a floss-based vaccine could eliminate the pain and logistical challenges surrounding injections and \"even be distributed through the postal mail,\" the researchers behind the development wrote in their study, published July 22 in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering.\nSuch a vaccine could potentially be deployed in \"resource-limited settings with minimal training,\" they added, and be especially helpful in active outbreaks when vaccine coverage needs to be boosted quickly.\nPrevious studies have shown that vaccinations delivered in the cheek or under the tongue trigger satisfactory immune responses. But it can be difficult to deliver adequate doses of these vaccines through mucosal tissues in the mouth \u2014 the lining that acts as a barrier between our body and the environment.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nThe researchers behind the vaccine floss found a creative solution: Researchers focusing on gum disease have found particular areas in the mouth that are very permeable, meaning molecules are easily absorbed by the tissue. One of these areas is called the junctional epithelium (JE). The JE is found on the tissue between teeth, at the spot where the tooth's surface meets the gum line. By secreting different molecules, the JE detects and defends against pathogens that try to get in through the gums.\nThe study researchers thought that the JE's ability to allow molecules through and to stimulate an immune response made it a potential candidate for a vaccine site. To reach it, they needed something that could get into that small crevice between tooth and gum. So, they went out and bought some dental floss.\nTo explore this concept, the researchers tested their hypothesis in mice. Once they'd figured out how to floss a mouse's teeth \u2014 turns out, it's a two-person job \u2014 they set up a flossing schedule to expose 50 mice to an inactive flu virus. Killed, or \"inactivated\" viruses cannot cause infection and are a common component of vaccines; they're used to immunize humans against diseases such as hepatitis A and polio, for example, and are found in some types of flu shot.\nOne group of mice had their teeth flossed with the virus-coated floss three times, with two weeks between each dose. Then, a month after their final dose, they were exposed to an active flu virus. All survived, while a comparison group of mice that was left unvaccinated all died.\nFurther testing found that the mice that had been vaccinated via the floss had a strong immune response, producing ample antibodies and many immune cells. This immune defense was found throughout the body \u2014 known as systemic immunity \u2014 and in their saliva and feces.\n\"The floss-based vaccination induced both systemic and mucosal immunity, while conventional intramuscular shots largely stimulate systemic immunity,\" first study author Rohan Ingrole, a chemical engineer at Texas Tech University, told Live Science in an email. \"Mucosal immunity is important because most of the pathogens enter through the mucosal routes,\" he emphasized.\nIn theory, vaccine floss could thus have an edge over syringe vaccines by triggering this additional protection, but the team would like to directly compare the two methods in the future to validate this idea.\nNext, the researchers wanted to know if flossing could transfer compounds to the JE in humans. As an early test, they used a fluorescent marker and blue food coloring to coat a dental pick and had healthy volunteers floss their teeth with it. Photographs confirmed that a fair amount of the dye was transferred to the space between their teeth and gum, though just over 41% was left on the floss.\nThe next step, the researchers said, is to translate the research to larger animals, which \"can then lay the foundation for human testing in the near future,\" senior study author Harvinder Gill, a bioengineer at North Carolina State University, told Live Science in an email.\nThis article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.\nAmy Arthur is a U.K.-based journalist with a particular interest in health, medicine and wellbeing.

      "text": "What causes bleeding gums?\nHere\u2019s the lowdown on what you need to know about bleeding gums, including how to ease the symptoms\nIf you notice you have bleeding gums, you may be tempted to ignore them. Yet it\u2019s a symptom worth paying attention to, so you can understand the cause and treat it at an early stage. There are various reasons for bleeding gums, including poor oral hygiene, hormone fluctuations and vitamin deficiencies.\nMaintaining a regular brushing regime is crucial not just for your pearly whites but for your overall gum health. If plaque accumulates near the gums, it causes irritation and bleeding. Don\u2019t forget to gently brush the gum line, and check out our guide to the best electric toothbrushes to achieve a deep clean.\nYou\u2019ll be reassured to know you can treat bleeding gums, especially if you take action in the early stages. We\u2019ll delve into the common causes and how you can reduce your risk of developing this troubling symptom.\nWhat are bleeding gums?\nOften, the first sign of bleeding gums is when you notice blood in the sink. This is because it tends to show up when you're brushing your teeth. If your gums are sensitive or irritated, brushing can result in bleeding. That\u2019s not an excuse to avoid brushing. Poor oral hygiene is a common cause of bleeding gums, leading to plaque and bacteria accumulating on the gum line, so knowing how to floss your teeth and how to use an electric toothbrush correctly are good steps.\nOther causes of bleeding gums include gum disease, pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, tobacco use, and over-brushing, according to the American Dental Association. Bleeding gums can also indicate more serious underlying health issues, such as leukemia \u2013 though this is not common.\nWhat causes bleeding gums?\nBleeding gums can be a warning sign that something isn\u2019t right. Let\u2019s dig into the possible causes.\nGingivitis\nGingivitis is the early stage of gum disease. \u201cSymptoms of gingivitis include constant bad breath, swollen, red, and tender gums, and bleeding when brushing or flossing,\u201d says Dr Jeffrey Sulitzer, the chief clinical officer at SmileDirectClub.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nGingivitis is more common than you might expect. According to the CDC, nearly half of adults over 30 have gum disease. The good news is that if you catch gum disease in the early stages, it's reversible.\n\u201cThough it depends on the severity of the issue, standard treatment can include a dentist removing plaque and tartar build-up. Since most gingivitis is caused by poor oral hygiene, your dentist will recommend establishing better oral health habits,\u201d says Sulitzer.\nPeriodontitis\nPeriodontitis is a more advanced stage of gum disease \u2013 when it spreads beyond the gums to the bones. \u201cPeriodontitis includes symptoms of tooth loss, receding gums, bad breath, bleeding gums, and pain when chewing and brushing,\u201d says Sulitzer. Act early to avoid it deteriorating to the point where you may need surgery.\nVitamin deficiencies\nYou\u2019ll likely be aware of the link between eating sugary foods and cavities, but did you know your diet affects your gum health, too? \u201cA lack of vitamins C and K could lead to bleeding gums if your diet does not contain the proper levels you need to stay healthy,\u201d says Sulitzer.\nVitamin C is essential for collagen production, which supports optimal gum health. Don\u2019t forget vitamin K, too. It is crucial for blood clotting, which can lessen the chances of bleeding gums.\nPregnancy\nPregnant women are at greater risk of bleeding gums. According to the American Dental Association, hormonal fluctuations result in increased blood flow and sensitivity in the gums, making them prone to bleeding. While bleeding gums are common during pregnancy, they\u2019re not inevitable. Speak to your health provider who can advise on how to maintain your oral health during pregnancy.\nSmoking\nSmoking is not only linked to an increased risk of tooth staining and cavities, but it can also affect your gum health. According to the CDC, smoking is one of the main risk factors for advanced gum disease. Seek support to quit if you want a healthy smile.\nOver-brushing\nPoor oral hygiene is a leading cause of bleeding gums, but did you know over-brushing can be a problem too? If you\u2019re over-zealous with scrubbing, it can be counterproductive and result in bleeding gums, according to the American Dental Association. It might be a clue that you need to ease the pressure when brushing.\nHow can you treat bleeding gums?\nYou\u2019ll be reassured that bleeding gums are treatable, and gum disease can be reversed if you take action in the early stages. Here\u2019s how to keep bleeding gums at bay.\nBrush twice a day\nRegular brushing keeps your smile bright and maintains gum health. The American Dental Association recommends brushing twice a day for two minutes.\n\u201cProper dental hygiene is the first step to managing bleeding gums. Brushing, flossing, and rinsing are ways to prevent them,\u201d says Sulitzer. Use gentle, circular motions when brushing, and take your time to avoid missing spots. If you suspect you're overdoing it, opt for a soft-bristled toothbrush or invest in an electric toothbrush with a pressure sensor so you can nail your technique.\nFloss daily\nStruggling to reach those niggly bits in between your teeth? Flossing can come to the rescue. It\u2019s a great way to remove bacteria from hard-to-reach spots. Be gentle and avoid pinging the floss against your gum line. If you struggle with traditional flossing, why not try a water flosser like the Waterpik Complete Care 9.0? They work by squirting water into the spaces between the teeth to eliminate bacteria.\nAvoid tobacco\nTobacco use is a leading cause of gum disease. Quitting smoking can significantly reduce your risk of bleeding gums and other oral health issues.\nEat a nutrient-dense diet\nFocus on eating a well-balanced diet to make sure you\u2019re meeting all of your nutritional needs. For healthy gums, pay attention to the amount of vitamin C in your diet. Eat more oranges, broccoli, and bell peppers. Vitamin K is also your friend for optimal gum health. Fill your plate with leafy greens like kale, spinach, and collard greens.\nWhy not check out our easy Mediterranean diet meal plan to start you on the right track?\nSee a dentist regularly\nDon\u2019t forget to see your dentist regularly. They can monitor your gum health at check-ups and pick up any issues early on.\nLouise Bond is a UK-based writer specializing in health and wellbeing.

      "text": "'Lost' bacteria found on Neanderthal teeth could be used to develop new antibiotics\nFossilized dental plaque from archaic humans is revealing extinct bacteria that could lead to the development of new medicine.\nStrange bacteria trapped in Neanderthals' teeth may one day help researchers develop novel antibiotics, according to a study published May 4 in the journal Science, which used dental plaque from ancient and modern humans to investigate the evolution of mouth microbes.\nEvery person has their own oral microbiome \u2014 a set of hundreds of species of microscopic organisms that colonize our mouths. With hundreds of different species of microorganisms at any given time, the oral microbiome is large and diverse, and it varies based on a person's lived environment.\nTo investigate the ancient human oral microbiome, Christina Warinner, a biomolecular archaeologist at Harvard University, invented new techniques to analyze prehistoric human dental plaque that has hardened into calculus, also called tartar. \"Dental calculus is the only part of your body that routinely fossilizes while you're still alive,\" Warinner told Live Science. It also has the highest concentration of ancient DNA of any part of an ancient skeleton.\nWith just a few milligrams of dental calculus, Warinner can isolate billions of short DNA fragments from hundreds of species all scrambled together, then put those fragments back together to identify known species. And studying ancient remains puts up an additional hurdle: DNA found in the dental calculus of past humans may be from microbes that have gone extinct.\nIn their new study, Warinner and her colleagues analyzed dental calculus from 12 Neanderthals, one of our closest extinct human relatives; 34 archaeological humans; and 18 contemporary humans who lived from 100,000 years ago to the present in Europe and Africa. They sequenced over 10 billion DNA fragments and reassembled them into 459 bacterial genomes, about 75% of which mapped to known mouth bacteria.\nRelated: Mouth bacteria may explain why some kids hate broccoli\nThe researchers then zeroed in on two species from a genus of bacteria called Chlorobium found in seven Upper Pleistocene-era (126,000 to 11,700 years ago) individuals in the study. The unknown species do not match exactly to any known species, but are close to C. limicola, which is found in water sources associated with cave environments.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nIt is likely that \"these people that were living in these cave-associated environments got it in drinking water,\" Warinner said.\nThese Chlorobium species were almost entirely absent from the tartar in people who lived in the past 10,000 years. Between the Upper Pleistocene and the Holocene (11,700 years ago to present), over a span of about 100,000 years, humans have lived in caves, domesticated animals and invented 21st century plastics \u2014 all of which have their own distinct bacterial colonies. Changes in Chlorobium frequency appear to parallel our ancestors' changes in lifestyle.\nNowadays, the microbiomes in peoples' mouths are drastically different. \"With intensive toothbrushing, oral bacteria are now kept at low levels,\" Warinner said. \"We take for granted that we have radically altered the kinds of life we interact with.\"\nJohn Hawks, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Wisconsin who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email that \"one really cool thing about the microbes is that some of them weren't known from our mouths at all; they come from pond water. It tells us that these water sources were probably regular features of their lifestyles.\"\nThe team also analyzed so-called biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC), or gene clusters needed to create a specific compound, to determine what enzymes the Chlorobium species produced. By isolating and understanding such BGCs, scientists could develop new medicines.\nWhen inserted into living bacteria, the Chlorobium BGCs produced two novel enzymes that may have played a role in photosynthesis. The new techniques could one day lead to new antibiotics, Warinner said.\n\"Bacteria are the source of virtually all our antibiotics \u2014 we really haven't discovered any new major classes of antibiotics in the past couple years, and we're running out,\" Warinner said. \"These methods give us the chance to look for potential antibiotic-producing BGCs in the past.\"\nKristina Killgrove is a staff writer at Live Science with a focus on archaeology and paleoanthropology news.

      "text": "What is oxidative stress?\nOxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between the production of free radicals and the body\u2019s ability to counteract them.\nOxidative stress describes an imbalance between cells' production and elimination of byproducts of the breakdown of oxygen. These byproducts, known as reactive oxygen species (ROSs), are important for cell functioning but cause damage in high amounts. ROS belong to a larger category of highly reactive chemicals called free radicals. Because cells need ROSs to function, some researchers have described oxidative stress as a good thing in some contexts. Others say that oxidative stress, by definition, is bad.\nOxidative damage is involved in aging and in several diseases. Chemicals that inhibit oxidation and the production of ROSs are called antioxidants. Some research suggests antioxidants could help limit oxidative damage. However, it's unclear how much or to what effect.\nWhat causes oxidative stress?\nROSs are produced naturally when the body breaks down diatomic oxygen (O2) as part of cellular respiration, the process of extracting energy from glucose (sugar). In organisms that have one, this happens in the mitochondria, the so-called powerhouse of the cell. As part of the last stage of cellular respiration, the cell separates electrons, or negative subatomic particles, from byproducts of glucose. This enables the cell to make a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP), its main power source. The cell needs oxygen to accept the electrons at the end of this process, and most oxygen molecules are finally transformed into water.\nHowever, some oxygen molecules receive fewer electrons and are instead transformed into free radicals, specifically ROSs. These substances' missing electrons are what make them extremely reactive, and they will react with many substances in the cell to gain electrons and become more chemically stable. Some common ROSs are peroxides (such as hydrogen peroxide), superoxide and the hydroxyl radical.\n\"We constantly make those reactive oxygen species, as we call it, in every cell of the body,\" Ursula Jakob, a professor of molecular, cellular and developmental biology at the University of Michigan, told Live Science. In addition to being a byproduct of respiration, ROSs are used in cell signaling, or sending messages within or across cells.\nUrsula Jakob studies the role of oxidative stress on host defense and aging. Her research funded by the NIH has made strides in understanding exactly how the physiological oxidant bleach kills bacteria, and how bacteria\u2019s own defenses can protect against the cellular stress caused by bleach. She received her PhD in 1995 from Regensburg University.\nImmune responses, exposure to radiation, and other cellular responses to pollutants or toxic substances can also generate ROSs.\nHowever, production of ROSs doesn't cause damage on its own, as cells need some ROSs to function. Cells use antioxidants to get rid of excess ROSs, limiting potential damage. When the amount of ROSs overwhelms the cell\u2019s antioxidant system, ROSs accumulate, creating oxidative stress, said Jakob. That could be because of increased ROS production or decreased elimination from the cell.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nWhat are the effects of oxidative stress?\nNormally, cells use ROSs as part of their signaling processes \u2014 sending messages to other parts of a cell or to other cells. However, excess ROSs cause oxidative damage, which is oxidation of parts of the cell. Just as the oxidation of iron forms rust, this process can transform and damage the molecules that make up cells, which includes mutations in DNA and RNA, misfolded proteins, and other types of damage to sugars and lipids.\nCells can repair some amount of damage, but if it is too extensive it can trigger apoptosis (programmed cell death), a sort of self-destruct mechanism. In severe cases, it can also cause necrosis, which is when cells become so damaged that they are prematurely destroyed, leading to tissue death.\nResearch suggests that oxidative stress plays a role in many conditions. Some of the most well-established of these are type 2 diabetes, cancer, and hardening of the arteries, or atherosclerosis.\nOxidative stress has also been associated with several different neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and multiple sclerosis (MS). This relationship was first observed in the late 1980s, according to a 2004 article published in Nature Reviews Drug Discovery, with mounting evidence that oxidative stress plays a role in neurodegenerative disease since then. A 2016 article published in Experimental Neurology reviewed evidence of oxidative stress\u2019s role in MS from as early as 1987.\n\"The neurons that are at risk during [Alzheimer's Disease], they're profoundly affected by every known type of oxidative damage,\" said George Perry, a professor of neurobiology at the University of Texas. In Alzheimer's and some Parkinson's patients, Perry told Live Science, signs of oxidative damage show up in the cytoplasm, or main body, of some neurons, which are full of \"mitochondrial garbage\" \u2014 enzymes, along with molecules of copper and iron, that are usually found only in the mitochondria.\nOxidative damage is clearly a part of Alzheimer's. However, researchers haven't been able to pinpoint exactly how and to what extent oxidative stress throughout a person's life contributes to the disease. It's also hard to say if it causes aging \u2014 an idea that has long been proposed by researchers, said Jakobs.\n\"The jury's still out whether this is actually the case\" for aging, she said.\nWhat are the risk factors for oxidative stress?\nSmoking \"can generate some of these reactive species,\" said Marino Resendiz, a professor of chemistry at the University of Colorado in Denver. \"So then that can lead to damage,\" he told Live Science.\" UV radiation, which can cause oxidative damage, is also linked to skin and other types of cancer, according to the American Cancer Society.\nSome weak evidence suggests that consuming foods that contain antioxidants could reduce oxidative stress, and therefore, a diet deficient in antioxidants could be a risk factor. Some common foods rich in antioxidants include broccoli, carrots, potatoes, spinach and many berries, among others.\nHowever, the link between antioxidants and oxidative stress isn't clear. For instance, consuming supplements containing antioxidants did not decrease signs of oxidative stress in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease in a 2012 clinical trial published in JAMA, and was even associated with faster cognitive decline. However, a 2019 review article found some evidence that taking a supplement containing vitamin E, which is an antioxidant, may be helpful for people with Alzheimer\u2019s, including evidence from clinical trials.\nObesity may increase oxidative stress because free radicals can bind to and damage fat. Therefore, lifestyle changes such as exercise and eating a balanced diet could help limit oxidative stress, Jakob said.\n\"Obesity is a huge risk factor,\" she said. In a huge variety of model organisms, from yeast to primates, Jakob said, exercise and restricting calories is associated with less oxidative damage to cells. But it's not a straightforward effect. Though she said exercise and calorie restriction can actually increase oxidative stress, in a 2019 study published in Nature, she and other researchers found that in a species of roundworm, increased oxidative stress early life can help protect against later oxidative damage.\nThough she emphasized that this research was not in humans, Jakob said it underscores the importance of ROSs, at least in controlled amounts.\n\"It's not like, oh, we're removing all the reactive oxygen species and that's healthy,\" she said. \"In this case, it's actually healthy to have some higher levels of reactive oxygen species.\"\nRebecca Sohn is a freelance science writer.

      "text": "Mysterious migraines after heart surgery may finally be explained\nShort-lived lesions sometimes appear in the brain following heart surgery \u2014 and now, a new trial hints that they might be linked to migraines and visual auras. More work is needed to know if they signal more serious risks, like stroke.\nAfter a common heart surgery, some patients experience migraines with visual auras \u2014 temporary vision disturbances, such as flashing lights and zigzag lines. The reason for this unusual complication was a mystery, but now, research hints that blood clots in the brain may be the culprit.\n\"These [clots] have previously not been thought to result in any symptoms or to have any clear adverse consequences,\" study co-author Dr. Gregory Marcus, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, told Live Science in an email.\nThe new study, published July 7 in the journal Heart Rhythm, proposes a new theory about why these mysterious migraines manifest.\nA sign of something serious?\nTo treat arrhythmias, or irregular heartbeats, doctors perform a catheter ablation, which involves inserting a tube into the heart to burn or scar any heart tissue driving the irregularity. About 360,000 people in the U.S. undergo the surgery each year.\nDifferent catheter ablation techniques can be used depending on the location of the faulty heart tissue. One strategy, called \"transseptal puncture,\" creates an opening between two heart chambers, whereas another, known as the \"retrograde approach,\" doesn't require this hole to be made.\nBut in the months following a catheter ablation, 2.3% of patients with no history of migraines with visual auras report these symptoms for the first time. The auras themselves typically appear just before or during a migraine attack.\nThese new symptoms are concerning because ischemic stroke, which occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked, is 2.6 times more likely in people under 45 who experience migraines with visual auras, and it's 3.7 times more likely in women of that same age group who experience them. So these migraines could be harbingers of serious cardiovascular events.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nMysterious origin of visual auras\nScientists have several theories as to why catheter ablation might be linked to migraine. One theory posits that the hole created by transseptal puncture might trigger the complication by rerouting blood from its typical path.\nBlood normally circulates from the right side of the heart to the lungs, then to the left side of the heart, and finally to the rest of the body, including the brain. However, a puncture could allow blood to travel directly from the left to the right heart chambers, bypassing the lungs. Researchers think this detour could allow some type of neurotoxin \u2014 normally broken down by lung enzymes \u2014 to reach the brain and trigger auras.\nHowever, MRI scans have revealed an alternative visual-aura trigger: brain lesions caused by emboli, meaning bits of blood clots, air bubbles or fatty deposits that travel through the bloodstream and then obstruct blood vessels in the brain.\nMigraines with visual auras also occur in people without a history of heart surgery, but the mechanism behind the phenomenon is unclear in those scenarios, as well. Marcus said that previous studies have found that people who experience these auras, in general, tend to also have a history of brain emboli.\n\"But it has been very difficult to determine if there was a causal relationship between the two,\" he said. Since brain emboli tend to be ephemeral, clinicians would have to conduct scans around the same time that the patient reports the auras to spot a link, he said.\nPatients undergoing catheter ablation may present a chance to explore the connection, because the surgeries can cause more emboli to appear. Debris from the burnt heart tissue can travel to the brain, block blood flow, and thus starve the brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients, Marcus said. These lesions are temporary, but he and his team suspected that the emboli may be linked to the auras following heart surgery.\nSo they conducted a trial in which 63 arrhythmia patients were treated with the transseptal puncture and 57 with the retrograde approach. The patients underwent brain MRI scans the following day and completed a questionnaire one month later to report any visual auras. It turned out both surgical techniques were equally likely to result in visual auras.\n\"Our findings here show that the presence of a hole that provides communication between the right and left sides of the heart is not at all necessary for these visual auras to occur,\" Marcus said. Yet, looking at the MRI scans, they found that patients with brain emboli after surgery had a 12 times higher chance of developing visual auras than patients without emboli did.\nNext steps\nOnce thought to produce no symptoms, brain emboli may at least partly contribute to visual auras, Marcus said, adding that scientists should explore if the emboli are also linked to more serious problems, like stroke.\nThe new study has some weaknesses, though. Dr. Andrew Lee, an ophthalmologist at Houston Methodist Hospital in Texas who was not involved with the work, noted that \"the main limitations were that the migraine symptoms were self-reported.\" It's possible that \"even a validated and prospectively obtained questionnaire might misclassify a given participant's symptoms,\" Lee told Live Science in an email.\nHe also noted that the study did not assess whether any patients had a naturally occurring hole in their heart, called a patent foramen ovale. This hole between heart chambers forms during development and closes shortly after birth in most people, but in 25% of people, it stays open. The hole has been linked to migraines, visual auras and strokes when present in adults.\nSince the new study only explored whether brain lesions were linked to visual auras immediately following heart surgery, \"future work is necessary to determine if the results of this study are generalizable to migraine in general,\" Lee said.\nEditor's note: Dr. Gregory Marcus consults for and owns equity in InCarda, a drug delivery company aimed at treating cardiovascular diseases including arrhythmia.\nThis article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.\nKamal Nahas is a freelance contributor based in Oxford, U.K. His work has appeared in New Scientist, Science and The Scientist, among other outlets, and he mainly covers research on evolution, health and technology.

      "text": "Coronary artery disease (CAD): Causes, diagnosis and treatment\nCoronary artery disease (CAD) is caused by plaque buildup in the wall of arteries that supply blood to the heart.\nCoronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease and occurs when plaque buildup narrows or blocks one or more of the arteries that supply blood to the heart. The term is often used interchangeably with coronary heart disease (CHD).\nSpecifically, CAD is a problem of one or more arteries supplying the myocardium, the muscular layer of the heart. This is the thickest layer of tissue in the organ and consumes more oxygen than the rest of the heart, consequently requiring the most blood flow.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 382,820 people in the United States died from CAD in 2020, while 20.1 million adults ages 20 and older live with the condition.\nWhat causes coronary artery disease?\nCAD is caused by a process known as atherosclerosis, in which plaque builds up in the inner walls of arteries, causing them to narrow and become rigid. This blocks blood flow, and the blockage can rapidly worsen if a piece of plaque breaks off and causes a blood clot.\nOne factor that increases the likelihood of atherosclerosis is the long-term presence of high concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in the blood. These high levels can result from a relative deficiency of LDL receptors, which are proteins on the membranes of various body cells, especially liver cells. LDL receptors capture LDL from the blood, causing its contents \u2014 cholesterol and fat molecules called triglycerides \u2014 to be taken inside the cell and out of the blood. Thus, a lack of these receptors causes LDL cholesterol levels to be higher in the blood.\nHigh levels of LDL cholesterol provoke and exacerbate what doctors call atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, an umbrella term for atherosclerotic changes that can develop in blood vessels throughout the body; this includes CAD, which specifically affects the coronary arteries.\nOther factors that can provoke atherosclerosis include uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, hypertension (high blood pressure) and tobacco use.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nWhat are the symptoms of coronary artery disease?\nSymptoms of coronary artery disease generally don't appear until the narrowing and hardening of coronary arteries begins to obstruct the flow of blood to the myocardium (the muscular layer of the heart).\nWhen this obstruction does occur, it can produce angina \u2014 chest pain or chest heaviness that arises when the heart doesn't get enough oxygen \u2014 as well as pain in other places, such as the neck, shoulder or arm. Angina can be stable at first, meaning that it generally occurs only with exertion, related to physical activity or emotional stress and the strength of each heart contraction. However, this can progress to unstable angina, which is a type of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), a range of conditions associated with sudden, reduced blood flow to a part of the heart.\nKnown colloquially as a \"heart attack,\" ACS is a spectrum running from its least severe subtype, unstable angina; to an intermediate subtype, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI); to its most severe subtype, ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, symptoms of ACS resulting from coronary artery disease may include:\n- Dyspnea (difficulty breathing or shortness of breath)\n- Chest pain or chest heaviness\n- Pain in other places, such as the neck, shoulder or arm\n- Fatigue\n- Palpitations\n- Dizziness or fainting\n- Nausea\n- Sudden sweating\nHow is coronary artery disease diagnosed?\nTo diagnose coronary artery disease, doctors will look at a patient's medical history and any symptoms that could indicate heart problems. They may also perform a physical examination.\nOften, they will request an electrocardiography (ECG) test. ECG is a technique that detects changes in voltage over time across the heart, at different angles. When CAD causes enough blockage of blood flow to cause ischemia (insufficient blood supply) in particular parts of the heart, ECG can show abnormalities in the heart's activity.\nDoctors also will request blood tests. Important blood values include the concentration of LDL cholesterol in a person's blood and the concentration of triglycerides (fat molecules).\nPatients may be referred to a cardiologist for further tests, such as additional ECG testing, ultrasound imaging of the heart (echocardiography), or evaluation with a wearable heart monitor, a version of ECG that you wear for a few days or weeks that transmits data to the cardiologist.\nComplications of coronary artery disease\nCoronary artery disease can lead to a condition called myocardial ischemia in which an artery cannot deliver adequate quantities of blood and oxygen to the myocardium. This can happen due to an artery gradually becoming blocked with plaque, resulting in the lumen of the artery (the hollow middle through which blood passes) narrowing and the wall of the artery hardening.\nIn addition, an atherosclerotic artery that has not been blocked enough to cause ischemia can suddenly become blocked by a piece of plaque breaking off, getting stuck and growing larger by stimulating the clotting process. Generally, this would lead to ACS.\nEven without a plaque rupture, however, the gradual increase in blockage driven by atherosclerosis disrupts a person's ability to perform physical activities, such as walking up stairs or around the block.\nWhen doctors suspect that a patient's CAD may be causing life-threatening problems with the heart, such as ACS, myocarditis (inflammation of the heart's muscular tissue) or pericarditis (inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart), blood is tested to see if levels of certain enzymes are elevated, including a group of enzymes called troponins. Troponins are measured because they leak out of heart muscle tissue when it is damaged.\nIn cases of ACS, doctors can use troponin measurements and ECG to distinguish between broad subtypes of ACS, which has important implications for treatment and further testing. In cases when either heart failure or myocarditis is suspected, they'll also check blood for levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), a hormone that enters the blood when the heart is stressed.\nTreatment for coronary artery disease\nTreatment for CAD usually involves a combination of medication and lifestyle changes.\nMedications can include cholesterol-lowering drugs, aspirin (to make it harder for platelets to stick to one another and to walls of blood vessels to form clots), medications to slow the heart while increasing the power of each contraction, or medications to widen blood vessels and/or to decrease blood pressure.\nLifestyle changes can also help to reduce a patient's risk of CAD and related health problems. According to the Cleveland Clinic, these include stopping smoking, limiting alcohol use, maintaining a healthy weight, limiting foods high in saturated fat, sodium and sugar, and getting enough sleep.\nThis article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.\nDavid Warmflash is a medical researcher, astrobiologist, science communicator, and author, located in Portland, Oregon.

      "text": "Cholesterol-gobbling gut bacteria could protect against heart disease\nCertain microbes in the gut microbiome may guard against heart disease by lowering people's cholesterol.\nBacteria present in some people's guts may help break down cholesterol, making them less susceptible to heart disease, a new study suggests.\nThe link between a high diversity of gut microbes and a lower chance of cardiovascular disease is well established. Previous research has shown that people with heart-related diseases, such as atherosclerosis, carry different kinds of microbes in their guts than people without the conditions. Researchers thought this may be related to a microbe-made enzyme called IsmA that breaks down cholesterol.\nPeople whose gut bacteria made IsmA had less cholesterol in their blood than those whose gut bacteria didn't make this enzyme. However, the specific species of bacteria that make cholesterol-gobbling enzymes were not known.\nNow, a study published April 2 in the journal Cell has shown that bacteria in the genus Oscillibacter break down cholesterol and that people who carry more of those bacteria have lower cholesterol levels than people with fewer of those microbes.\nRelated: 9 heart disease risk factors, according to experts\nUncovering the bacteria that metabolize cholesterol is \"very interesting and exciting,\" Daoming Wang, a researcher at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, told Live Science in an email. Wang, a bioinformatician who studies the human gut microbiome, wasn't involved in the new study.\nTo understand how gut bacteria influence heart health, the researchers examined stool and blood samples collected from more than 1,400 people in the Framingham Heart Study, a decades-long study of heart disease risk factors.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nThe team used different techniques to profile the microbial DNA in the stool samples. They also analyzed metabolites \u2014 the byproducts left over when chemicals like cholesterol break down. For each participant, the team then correlated these findings with known markers of heart health, like blood-borne cholesterol and triglyceride levels.\nPeople with lower triglyceride and cholesterol levels had an abundance of Oscillibacter bacteria in their poop, the team found. They checked whether this correlation showed up in another, independent set of people and found that it did.\nTo confirm that Oscillibacter indeed metabolized cholesterol, the researchers grew the bacteria in the lab and exposed them to cholesterol marked with fluorescent tags. Using microscopy, the team looked for fluorescence within the bacterial cells, to see if the microbes sucked up the cholesterol \u2014 and they did.\nThe researchers then tracked the fate of the gobbled cholesterol and found that different bacterial species broke it down into various steroids. These steroids could be absorbed by other gut bacteria, resulting in decreased cholesterol levels overall.\nTo figure out which genes and proteins might help Oscillibacter break down cholesterol, the team used a machine-learning algorithm. The algorithm analyzes features of genes to predict how proteins encoded by these genes will look. This analysis revealed that genes that encoded proteins similar to IsmA were likely responsible for metabolizing cholesterol.\nThese results take us closer to understanding the \"dark matter\" of the microbiome, meaning the large number of gut microbial genes whose functions aren't yet known, Wang said. \"This dark matter hinders us from seeing the whole picture of gut bacterial functionality.\"\nIn theory, tweaking the gut microbiome to boost cholesterol breakdown could be a strategy to reduce people's cholesterol levels, the study authors proposed. But before that can be done, we need follow-up investigations to better understand exactly how these bacteria break down cholesterol and how this can be used as a therapy, Wang said. We need detailed studies in lab animals, followed by clinical trials in humans, he said.\nNonetheless, Wang added, \"it's very exciting to further explore the potential of manipulating Oscillibacter species as therapeutic interventions for managing cholesterol levels.\"\nEver wonder why some people build muscle more easily than others or why freckles come out in the sun?

These new findings have important implications for the prevention and treatment of RA.\nWhy was this study done?\nHow was this study done?\nThe study began by searching for common factors that may link periodontal disease and RA. Initial clues came from the study of periodontal samples, where the authors found that a similar process that had previously been observed in the joints of patients with RA was occurring in the gums of patients with periodontal disease. This common process is called \u201chypercitrullination\u201d. Citrullination occurs naturally in everyone as a way to regulate the function of proteins. However, in people with RA, this process becomes overactive, resulting in hypercitrullination and the abnormal accumulation of citrullinated proteins. This drives the production of antibodies against these proteins that create inflammation and attack the joints in patient with RA.\nWhat were the major findings?\nAmong different periodontal bacteria, the study identified that only one called Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) could trigger hypercitrullination in human white blood cells, the major source of citrullinated proteins in RA. Aa causes hypercitrullination by secretion of a toxin called leukotoxin A (LtxA) that pokes holes in white blood cells as a self-defense strategy to kill host immune cells. Further studies demonstrated that almost half of the patients with RA have evidence of infection by Aa, compared with 11% of healthy individuals. More strikingly, exposure to Aa was an important factor for production of antibodies to citrullinated proteins in patients with genetic susceptibility to RA.\nWhat is the impact of this work?\nCurrent treatment with steroids, biologic drugs and physical therapy are effective for reducing or slowing the crippling and painful joint deformities in some, but not all patients with RA. This study sheds new light on the longstanding relationship between gum disease and RA by identifying hypercitrullination as a common process that unites these two seemingly unrelated conditions. Learning more about how this process starts and causes the immune system to attack proteins in the joint may lead to new ways to treat and even prevent RA in the future.\nThis research was supported by:\nRheumatology Research Foundation, Fundaci\u00f3n Bechara, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) under grant numbers R01AR069569 and AR050026-01, the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) under grant numbers DE021127-01 and R37 DE12354, and the Intramural Research Program of the NIDCR.\nLink to original research article:\nAggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced hypercitrullination links periodontal infection to autoimmunity in rheumatoid arthritis.

      "text": "Heart disease: Types, prevention and treatments\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, and encompasses a range of conditions. But are there ways to avoid it?\nAs can be expected from an organ responsible for getting blood throughout the body, the root of heart disease is when that blood flow is blocked.\nHeart disease, or cardiovascular disease, encompasses a range of conditions, including blood vessel diseases such as coronary artery disease, problems with heart rhythm (arrhythmias) and congenital heart defects, according to the Mayo Clinic. It is the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), claiming over 697,000 lives in the United States in 2020.\n\"The heart is a fascinating and complex organ which acts as the pump to facilitate blood circulation around the body,\" said Dr. Daniel Sado, a cardiology consultant for HCA Healthcare UK at London Bridge Hospital in England. \"In order to achieve this, its key structures are muscle, coronary arteries and heart valves, with muscle contraction controlled by electrical pathways.\"\nFor around 100,000 beats per day, on average, these mechanisms work beautifully in unison to keep people alive, Sado told Live Science. \"However, each bit can go wrong and lead to different diseases of the heart,\" he said.\nTypes and symptoms of heart disease\nCoronary artery disease is the most common type of heart disease in the United States, according to the CDC. It occurs when cholesterol builds up in arteries \u2014 called plaque \u2014 narrowing the space blood can flow through, a condition called atherosclerosis.\nIn other words, \"anything that blocks the vessel,\" said Dr. Lawrence Phillips, a cardiologist and assistant professor at NYU Langone Medical Center, New York City.\nUltimately, the narrowing can build up enough to cause chest pain and shortness of breath \u2014 called angina \u2014 or it can block the vessel completely, causing a heart attack. Heart attacks can also be caused by the rupture of a plaque that causes a blockage of the blood vessels, Phillips told Live Science. Over 1 million Americans suffer heart attacks each year, according to the American Heart Association.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nDr. Lawrence Phillips is an associate professor for the Department of Medicine at NYU Grossman School of Medicine. He is an assistant clinical director for strategic affairs at Leon H. Charney Division of Cardiology, a director of the Nuclear Cardiology Laboratory, an associate director of the Cardiovascular Disease Fellowship Program and a medical director at Outpatient Clinical Cardiology.\nAnother cause of heart disease is an arrhythmia, a condition where the heart beats too quickly (tachycardia), too slowly (bradycardia) or irregularly. Symptoms can include a fluttering feeling in the chest, racing heartbeat, slow heartbeat, chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting (syncope) or near fainting, according to the Mayo Clinic.\nHeart disease may also be caused by problems a person is born with, known as congenital heart defects. Symptoms of heart defects in children can include pale gray or blue skin (cyanosis), swelling in the legs, abdomen or around the eyes, and shortness of breath during feeding in infants (causing poor weight gain), according to the Mayo Clinic.\nLess serious congenital heart defects may not be diagnosed until late childhood or adulthood. These defects are not immediately life threatening, and symptoms include becoming short of breath or tired easily during exercise or activity, as well as swelling in the hands, ankles or feet.\nOther forms of heart disease can be caused by weak heart muscle, heart infections, or diseases of the heart valves.\nHow is heart disease diganosed?\nFive symptoms can indicate when someone is having a heart attack and requires immediate emergency care, calling 911. These include pain in the jaw, neck or back; pain in the arms or shoulder; chest pain; lightheadedness or weakness; and shortness of breath, Phillips said.\nHeart disease symptoms may differ for men and women, according to the Mayo Clinic. Men are more likely to have chest pain, while women are more likely to have shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue.\nDr. John Whyte, the chief medical officer at WebMD, encouraged the use of risk estimators, such as the one developed by the American College of Cardiology. \"It's also important to get lab tests which can include lipid panels, C-reactive protein as well as vitamin D,\" he said. \"People need a baseline electrocardiogram [which records the electrical signal from the heart]. There's also numerous tests such as a 'stress test' which can be done on a treadmill with or without nuclear imaging.\nA coronary computed tomography angiography can look at calcium deposits in a person's blood vessels, Whyte said, and a cardiac angiography looks for any blockages.\nA number of factors play a role in heart disease risk. Some include family history and age (if a person is older or has relatives with heart disease, the risk goes up), but others are more controllable.\n\"Prevention is always far better than cure and so much of our work in cardiovascular disease is aimed at looking at lifestyle improvement,\" Sado said. \"Of course, the benefits of doing this stretch far beyond the heart.\"\nMuch of the advice to avoid heart disease is the same health advice given for other conditions: stop smoking, exercise and eat a diet that is low in cholesterol and salt \u2014 cholesterol being the source of blockage and salt contributing to higher blood pressure. Other things to limit in the diet include saturated fats, which typically come from animal fats and oils, and trans fats, which occur in vegetable oil, but have largely been removed from the marketplace because of consumer demand.\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), diabetes can increase heart disease risk by as much as 100%, as the higher levels of glucose in the blood that are characteristic of diabetes can leave fatty deposits in blood vessels, which, like cholesterol plaques, can cause blockage of the heart.\nIs heart disease preventable?\nIn addition to lifestyle changes, some treatments are available to help prevent heart disease. Many of these medications are designed to lower cholesterol.\nThere are two types of cholesterol. The first, LDL, is often referred to as \"bad cholesterol\" because it is the type that can build up and block blood vessels. The other, HDL, is often called \"good cholesterol\" because it is responsible for transporting LDL to the liver, ultimately removing it from the bloodstream.\nOptimally, HDL cholesterol levels should be above 40 (measured in milligrams per deciliter of blood) and LDL cholesterol should be below 100, according to the CDC.\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved a number of drugs for improving cholesterol levels. Perhaps the best-known are statins, which slow cholesterol production by the liver and speed up how fast it removes LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream.\nAnother class of drug to lower cholesterol is called bile acid sequestrants. These drugs remove bile acids from the body. Because the body produces these acids from LDL cholesterol, more LDL cholesterol will be broken down to replace them.\nNiacin and fibrates are other drug classes for improving cholesterol levels. Both increase HDL cholesterol, while niacin lowers LDL cholesterol.\nHow is heart disease treated?\nSurgical options can also treat heart disease. Coronary angioplasty is performed over one million times each year on patients in the United States, according to the NIH. In this procedure, a balloon is threaded into the affected blood vessel and inflated, pushing the plaque blocking the artery to the sides of the vessel. Sometimes, this procedure is accompanied by placement of a stent \u2014 a mesh tube designed to hold the blood vessel open.\n\"There are a lot of good treatment options today and tech can play a role in helping you eat healthy and stay physically active,\" Whyte said. \"Smartwatches and smart devices, even devices like Lumen and continuous glucose monitors, can help you manage diet and activity. There are a range of medications to treat heart disease as well as devices such as stents.\"\nThis article is for informational purposes only, and is not meant to offer medical advice.\nAdditional resources\n- To learn more about the causes of heart disease, check out the Mayo Clinic.\n- The National Institutes of Health explains the risk factors for heart disease.\n- For more facts and figures on heart disease, see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n- Lou MudgeHealth Writer"

      "text": "How does plaque cause cavities?\nA buildup of dental plaque breaks down tooth enamel, leading to tooth decay, gum disease and other oral health conditions.\nDentists say to \"brush twice a day\" to prevent sticky plaque from building up on your teeth and raising the risk of cavities. But how does plaque cause cavities, exactly?\nThe link between plaque and tooth decay largely stems from how the bacteria in plaque interact with the foods we eat. However, factors such as a person's age and whether they smoke or take certain medications can also play a role in plaque-driven tooth decay.\nFor background, plaque is a colorless film of bacteria that sticks to the surface of teeth and also catches bits of food in the mouth. To start forming a film, plaque microbes first embed themselves among proteins found in the saliva on a tooth's surface.\nCavities, or areas of tooth decay, tend to happen when foods rich in sugars and starchy carbohydrates \u2014 such as candy, honey, bread or cereals \u2014 come into contact with plaque bacteria, Dr. Purnima Kumar, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry and a spokesperson for the American Dental Association (ADA), told Live Science by email. When these microbes feed off the sugar from those foods, they produce acids that break down tooth enamel, the protective outer covering of the tooth, she said.\nRelated: How often should you floss?\nEver wonder why some people build muscle more easily than others or why freckles come out in the sun? Send us your questions about how the human body works to community@livescience.com with the subject line \"Health Desk Q,\" and you may see your question answered on the website!\n\"Since plaque is sticky, the acids produced by the bacteria in plaque can stay in contact with your teeth for a long time and, over time, break down enamel, creating the perfect environment for a cavity to form,\" Kumar said. \"Cavities usually develop over an extended period of time and take months to years to form.\"\nThis is due to the enamel's hardy structure. Made primarily of a sturdy mineral called calcium phosphate, the tooth's outermost layer is the hardest tissue in the human body, according to a 2017 review published in the journal Physiology Reviews. This allows enamel to shield the underlying dental pulp from damage caused by temperature changes, physical trauma or harmful chemicals.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nAcids produced by plaque bacteria are too weak to deplete enamel of all its minerals at once \u2014 however, if they stay in contact with teeth for long enough, the acids will eventually break through the enamel to the sensitive tissues beneath.\nKumar said that some individuals, particularly those with a condition called dry mouth, are more susceptible than others to tooth decay from plaque and tartar, which is hardened dental plaque that can't be removed with normal brushing and flossing. Saliva not only helps people chew and swallow food but also protects teeth and gums by reducing the growth of harmful bacteria and maintaining a neutral pH in the mouth, according to the ADA. It does this by helping flush microbes and dietary carbs from the mouth and by supplying compounds that slow microbial growth or stop bacteria from sticking to teeth.\nDry mouth can be caused by multiple factors, including cigarette smoking, radiation therapy applied to the head or neck, and certain medications, such as tricyclic antidepressants, decongestants and diuretics, Kumar said.\nChildren and older adults are also at higher risk of cavities than other age groups. \"Poor oral hygiene habits, frequent consumption of sugary diet and frequent snacking are just a few ways children can be more susceptible, but having a family history of cavities can also contribute to this [risk],\" Kumar said.\nTooth decay in older adults, on the other hand, is linked to dental fillings. \"Because many older adults lacked fluoride and modern dental care when growing up, they often have many dental fillings, and these fillings are weakened over the years and tend to fracture,\" Kumar said. Bacteria accumulate in these tiny cracks and cause acid buildup, leading to decay, she added.\n\"You might also be at increased risk if you snack between meals, eat sugary foods and drinks at frequent intervals, and have cracked or chipped teeth,\" she said.\nThis article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.\nAnna Gora is a health writer at Live Science, having previously worked across Coach, Fit&Well, T3, TechRadar and Tom's Guide.

      "text": "Weight loss may 'rejuvenate' fat tissues, clearing away aged cells\nWeight loss is known to improve health in obesity. A new study provides clues to how: by rejuvenating fat tissue and changing fat cells' metabolism.\nDespite decades of research focusing on obesity, what happens in the body when we lose weight, and why losing weight can improve health, is still poorly understood.\nNow a new study, published in Nature on Wednesday (July 9), provides clues as to what may actually be happening. It suggests that the weight loss does more than shave off pounds \u2014 it changes fat on a cellular level, rewiring how the tissue is metabolized and maybe even \"rejuvenating\" it.\nThe research also offers insights into why losing weight does not necessarily eliminate all the health problems associated with obesity. The study found that some markers of poor health in obesity, such as cells that drive inflammation, were not resolved after weight loss.\n\"What we're excited by is being able to really understand the 'yins and yangs' of weight loss,\" study lead author William Scott, an obesity researcher from Imperial College London, told Live Science.\nThanks to this kind of research, \"we may, in the future, be able to develop drugs that target the good bits, but also block the harmful bits that get hardwired by obesity,\" he added.\nZooming in on fat cells\nTo understand what may be happening in fat cells when people lose weight, Scott and his colleagues collected samples of subcutaneous abdominal fat \u2014 fat that grows under the skin around the belly \u2014 from 25 volunteers with obesity before and after weight-loss surgery. The samples were collected between five and 18 months post-surgery, when the participants had lost an average of 55 pounds (25 kilograms) and were still in an \"active\" weight loss phase, said Scott.\nRelated: Fat cells have a 'memory' of obesity, study finds\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nThe samples were compared to tissues collected from 24 lean volunteers whose body mass indices were in the \"normal\" range. They also compared the data to a previously published \"atlas\" of all the white fat in the body, which also cataloged the chemical processes occurring in that fat tissue.\nThe scientists then studied how weight loss affected cell activity. They measured which genes were active in each cell by looking at their RNA molecules. RNA is a cousin of DNA that copies down information from genes and serves as the blueprint for proteins, so looking at which RNAs are present and how many can be used as a measure of gene activity. This method, called single nucleus RNA sequencing, reveals what the cells were about to do when sampled, and how they were interacting with each other at the time.\nGetting that level of insight into the fat tissue is important because, contrary to popular belief, it is not a monolithic, passive mass. Instead, it is made up of many cell types \u2014 fat cells (also called adipocytes), immune cells, vascular cells and nerve cells \u2014 that work together. These diverse cells send signals to the body and brain, helping regulate metabolism, appetite and overall health.\nAltogether, the study analyzed the RNA expression of more than 170,000 cells in the fat tissues.\nReversing aging and recycling fatty molecules\nThe study showed that fat tissue in larger bodies tends to be prone to \"senescence,\" meaning some cells act aged and are more damaged than younger cells. Scientists suspect these senescent cells may fuel the diseases associated with obesity, as they promote inflammation and fibrosis, or scarring.\nHowever, in weight loss, that senescence seems to be reversed, and the tissue appears healthier.\n\"The body clears damaged and harmful cells and, in effect, is rejuvenating our tissues,\" Scott said. \"We weren't really surprised by that,\" as this had been hinted at in other studies, \"but we were surprised by the extent to which that seems to happen.\"\nFurthermore, weight loss seems to change the way the fat cells interact with fatty molecules, called lipids. High lipid levels in the blood can harm the body. When storage capacity within fat tissue is exceeded, lipids accumulate in other tissues like the liver and pancreas, likely contributing to insulin resistance, liver disease and diabetes.\nThe new research suggests that fat cells not only break down lipids, but also recycle them, using the components to make new fatty molecules. This process may burn energy, helping with weight loss, and may also keep harmful fats from building up in other organs and causing problems.\nSome cellular changes associated with obesity weren't reversed, however. The researchers noticed that immune cells, which infiltrate fat tissue and drive disease in obesity, were still present after weight loss.\n\"We found that obesity hard wires some of the processes in the cells,\" Scott said. \"There's a memory in fat tissue.\" That means that losing weight is \"never going to be as good\" as maintaining a healthy weight in the first place.\nAndrew Hoy, a lipid metabolism researcher at the University of Sydney who wasn't involved in the study, told Live Science by email that the method the team used doesn't capture all the complex cellular interactions that may be at play. As such, it can't say for sure that fat cells are being \"rejuvenated\" or that immune cells remain after weight loss, he said.\nWhat's more, the study only looked at subcutaneous fat, but visceral fat, which surrounds internal organs, is known to be more closely linked with disease. So studying visceral fat may be more helpful for determining what drives disease in obesity, Hoy argued.\nScott added that the study cannot explain what drives the observed changes in fat tissues during weight gain or loss. He hopes that further research would help show what is happening at different stages of weight loss and gain, as well as when weight plateaus.\nIt may also be that the weight loss surgery helped usher the cellular changes and weight loss at the same time, rather than the weight loss itself driving the changes, suggested Dr. Francesco Rubino, a metabolic surgery researcher at King's College London in the U.K. who wasn't involved in the study.\nHe told Live Science in an email that he thinks the work supports the idea that dramatic weight loss, by itself, should not be the sole goal of obesity treatment. His and other research suggests that gains to metabolic health can happen even with modest weight loss, and that the metabolic improvements are the important bit.\n\"We assume that there is a proportion between weight loss and outcomes. That, I think, is a fundamental mistake,\" Rubino told Live Science. \"You shouldn't judge the success of treatment based only on weight loss, because you might lose less weight and still achieve fantastic benefits,\" he added.\nThis article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.\nMarianne is a freelance science journalist specializing in health, space, and tech.

      "text": "What is inflammation?\nInflammation is the body's response to injury or infection. It works to help heal wounds, but it can also play a role in chronic disease.\nInflammation is a vital part of the immune system's response to physical trauma, infection or toxins. Inflammation is the body's way of healing and repairing damaged tissue and defending itself against foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria.\nWithout inflammation, wounds would fester and infections could become deadly.\nThere are two main types of inflammation: acute and chronic. Acute inflammation is an immediate response that is usually helpful and ideally disappears once the attack is over. However, if the inflammation does not resolve it can become chronic and problematic. Chronic inflammation has been linked to certain diseases, such as heart disease or stroke, and also plays a role in some autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.\nTypes of inflammation\nAcute inflammation\nAcute inflammation is the body's first line of defence. It's a short-term response with localized effects, meaning it works at the precise place where an attack begins. Galen, the second-century physician to Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, identified five main signs of acute inflammation:\n- Redness\n- Swelling\n- Heat\n- Pain\n- Loss of function\nIn the case of acute inflammation, blood vessels dilate, blood flow increases and white blood cells swarm the injured area to promote healing, Dr. Scott Walker, a family practice doctor at Gunnison Valley Hospital in Utah told Live Science. This response is what causes the injured area to turn red and become swollen.\nDamaged or infected tissue also releases cytokines, or chemical \"emergency signals\" that bring in your body's immune cells, hormones and nutrients to fix the problem, Walker told Live Science.\nIn addition, pro-inflammatory compounds called prostaglandins create blood clots to heal damaged tissue and trigger pain. They also cause fever, which can help kill pathogens. As the body heals, the acute inflammation gradually subsides. Acute inflammation, when well-regulated by the body, typically lasts around 10 days from the initial attack.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nDr. Scott Walker is a family practice doctor. He received his medical degree from the University of Utah and his Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine from Kansas City University. He completed his family medicine residency at University of Wyoming with a specialty in obstetrics. Walker is certified by the American Board of Family Medicine and the American Osteopathic Association.\nChronic inflammation\nChronic inflammation occurs when this acute process doesn't subside completely. Chronic inflammation is also called persistent, low-grade inflammation because it produces a steady, low-level of inflammation throughout the body, as judged by a small rise in immune system markers found in blood or tissue. This type of systemic inflammation can linger for months or years, and can contribute to the development of disease.\nLow levels of inflammation can be triggered by a perceived internal threat, even when there isn't a disease to fight or an injury to heal, and sometimes this signals the immune system to respond. As a result, white blood cells swarm to a particular area of the body but have nothing to do and nowhere to go, and they may eventually start attacking internal organs or other healthy tissues and cells, Walker said. In this way, inflammation can sometimes lead to autoimmune conditions.\nChronic inflammation caused by allergies, smoking or excessive alcohol consumption may also continually simmer under the surface. And while this low-grade level of chronic inflammation often does not have symptoms, doctors can test for C-reactive protein (CRP) \u2014 a marker for inflammation in the blood. For instance, high levels of CRP have been linked with an increased risk of heart disease.\nBesides looking for clues in the blood, a person's diet, lifestyle habits and environmental exposures can contribute to chronic inflammation. Therefore, it's important to maintain a healthy lifestyle to keep inflammation in check.\nDisease caused by inflammation\nResearchers are still working to understand the effects of chronic inflammation on the body and the mechanisms involved, however it's known to play a role in the development of many diseases.\nHeart disease and stroke\nOne theory suggests that when inflammatory cells linger in blood vessels, they promote the buildup of plaque. The body perceives this plaque as a foreign substance that doesn't belong, so it tries to wall off the plaque from the blood flowing inside the arteries. If plaques become unstable and burst, that can lead to blood clots that block blood flow to the heart or brain, leading to a heart attack or stroke.\nCancer\nCancer is another disease linked with chronic inflammation. Over time, chronic inflammation can cause DNA damage and leads to some forms of cancer. For example, people with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease, have an increased risk of colorectal cancer.\nAnti-inflammatory drugs\nMost chronic inflammatory disorders have no cure, however, there are a wide range of prescription and over-the-counter drugs that can help alleviate the symptoms of inflammation. The most common over-the-counter medications are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which include:\n- Aspirin\n- Naproxen\n- Ibuprofen\nNSAIDs work by blocking an enzyme called cyclooxygenase, which produces prostaglandins. Other drugs, such as paracetamol or acetaminophen, relieve pain but do not target inflammation.\nCorticosteroids, such as cortisone and prednisone, broadly tune down the immune response and may be prescribed for inflammatory conditions, such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. In asthma, for example, they can help reduce inflammation and swelling in the airways. However, although corticosteroids are effective drugs, they can have unwanted side effects, such as high blood pressure, mood swings and weight gain.\nBefore taking any of these drugs, it\u2019s always best to speak to a healthcare provider.\nAdditional resources:\nThis article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.\nJessie Szalay is a contributing writer to FSR Magazine.

      "text": "Key points\n- Periodontal (gum) diseases, such as gingivitis and periodontitis, are largely preventable and treatable. The key is good oral hygiene, overall self-care, and regular care from a dental health care provider.\n- Periodontal disease refers to conditions that involve inflammation and infection of the tissues (gum and bone) that surround and support the teeth.\nOverview\nPeriodontal (gum) disease is a broad term for conditions involving inflammation and infection of the tissues (gum and bone) that surround and support the teeth. 12\nGingivitis is a type of gum disease that involves inflammation of the gums. It is largely preventable and treatable with a combination of routine oral hygiene and professional cleanings. 12\nPeriodontitis, which also involves bone loss around teeth, is an irreversible condition that can be slowed down and managed with professional treatment.12\nPeriodontitis is a very common type of gum disease among U.S. adults:\n- About 4 in 10 U.S. adults 30 years or older had a mild, moderate, or severe level of periodontitis in 2009\u20132014.3\n- About 1 in 2 men and 1 in 3 women 30 years or older had some level of periodontitis.3\nPeriodontitis is more common as people age. About 60% of adults 65 years or older had periodontitis in 2009\u20132014.34\nTypes\nTwo of the most common types of gum disease are gingivitis and periodontitis.\nGingivitis\nThe mildest form of gum disease is gingivitis, an inflammatory condition where the gums become red, swollen, and may easily bleed. Gingivitis is a reversible condition. But if left untreated, it can lead to a gum disease called periodontitis.14\nPeriodontitis\nPeriodontitis is a chronic inflammatory condition that leads to mild, moderate, or severe destruction of the supporting tissues around teeth. A main feature of periodontitis is bone loss around the affected teeth.25 Untreated periodontitis can also make other chronic conditions, such as diabetes, worse.16\nPeriodontitis cannot be reversed, but it can be slowed down and managed with professional treatment. Periodontitis and cavities (tooth decay) are the two leading causes of tooth loss.7\nSigns and symptoms\nGum disease can often become serious before a person notices that they have symptoms.1 A yearly dental checkup can help to detect and prevent this condition.\nSigns and symptoms of gum disease may include:1\n- Red, swollen, or tender gums.\n- Bleeding gums.\n- Gums that have moved away or downward from your teeth.\n- Loose or sensitive teeth.\n- Painful chewing.\n- Any change in the way your teeth fit together when biting.\n- Any change in how well your partial denture fits.\nRisk factors\nResearch is ongoing to learn more about the risk factors for gum disease. Some studies have indicated an association between gum disease and certain factors or characteristics, including:\n- Smoking.1348\n- Diabetes.4689\n- Poor oral hygiene.410\n- Medication with oral side effects.14\n- Stress.11\n- Genetics.148\n- Malocclusion (crooked teeth), clenching, or bruxism (grinding teeth).14\n- Underlying systemic conditions.14812\n- Hormonal changes, such as with pregnancy or menopause.148\n- Poor nutrition or obesity.1413\nWho is at risk\nAbout 62% of U.S. adults 30 years or older who are current smokers had periodontitis in 2009\u20132014.3\nAmong U.S. adults 30 years or older, periodontitis also disproportionately affects those who are:3\n- Living below 100% of the federal poverty level (60%).\n- Living with diabetes (60%).\n- Mexican American (60%).\n- Non-Hispanic Black (57%).\nCauses\nIt is normal for some bacteria to live in a healthy mouth.14 Bacteria in the mouth constantly produce and dwell within a sticky, removable film on tooth surfaces called plaque.1\nIf plaque is left to build up on a tooth, it can lead to inflammation around the tooth and result in gingivitis. Plaque can be removed regularly with toothbrushing and flossing. If it is not removed, it will usually harden into tartar (also called calculus). Tartar buildup cannot be removed with toothbrushing. Professional treatment is needed to remove it.\nBacteria in buildup can spread below the gumline and lead to the formation of a periodontal \"pocket.\" This pocket is an abnormal deepening of the space between tooth surfaces and gum tissues. Bacteria can release toxins in the pocket that make inflammation worse.1215\nAs this process continues, it contributes to the destruction of gum tissues and bone loss around the teeth, which is a main feature of periodontitis.\nPrevention\nGingivitis can be largely prevented and treated with a combination of self-care and professional cleanings. More severe forms of gum disease can be managed by a dental health care provider and may include referral to a specialist called a periodontist.16\nTo help prevent or manage gum diseases, it is important to:\n- Brush twice daily and floss every day to remove plaque and debris.\n- Get regular professional cleanings.\n- Have a dental checkup at least once a year, or more often if recommended by your health care provider.\nTreatment and recovery\nTreatment for periodontitis might include:\n- A non-surgical procedure commonly known as \"scaling and root planing\"17 or \u201cdeep cleaning\u201d of the affected tooth and root surfaces.\n- Prescribed medication, such as an oral rinse or medicine placed directly under the affected gums.\n- Surgical procedures.18\nHow to Find Low-Cost Dental Care\nWhat CDC is doing\nCDC's Division of Oral Health (DOH) works with key partners to improve and sustain the surveillance of gum disease in the U.S. adult population. These partners have included the American Academy of Periodontology and the American Dental Association.\nDOH efforts to monitor and address gum disease include:\n- Developing and testing the validity of measures that can be used to track gum disease at national, state, and local levels.\n- Updating methods to simplify how data on gum disease are collected from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey participants.\n- Developing simple gum disease screening tools for use in clinical settings.\n- Working to integrate medical and dental care.\nResources\nMore Information About Periodontal Disease\n- National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research: Periodontal (Gum) Diseases: Causes, Symptoms and Treatment\n- American Academy of Periodontology\nPodcasts About Periodontal Disease and Diabetes\nListen to Summary: Periodontal Disease and Diabetes Podcast.
