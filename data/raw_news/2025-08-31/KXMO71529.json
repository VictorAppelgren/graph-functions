  "title": "Is an XRP Breakout on the Horizon?",
  "description": "Is XRP about to skyrocket or stumble? Here's what you should know.",
  "content": "\u2022 At the same time, XRP's $168 billion market cap looks expensive when RippleNet only generates a tiny trickle of annual fees.\n\u2022 XRP needs a price correction before it becomes an attractive investment opportunity again.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than XRP \u203a\n\nThe XRP (CRYPTO: XRP) cryptocurrency, formerly known as Ripple, has been volatile in 2025. Its price per coin has swung as high as $3.56 and as low as $1.79 this year. The XRP chart currently sits at $2.97, just above the midpoint of that wild range.\n\nThis volatility follows on the heels of skyrocketing gains in 2024. On the afternoon of Aug. 29, XRP was up 421% in 52 weeks.\n\nDoes XRP have room to go higher before the end of 2025, or is it more likely to see a price cut by the end of the year? Let's think about that.\n\nSome crypto market watchers expect XRP to soar in the near future. Bullish catalysts include the XRP-based RLUSD (CRYPTO: RLUSD) stablecoin, the pending approval of the first XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and the general trend of higher prices in recent months.\n\nThe crypto-friendly Trump administration plays a part in this rosy view, and for good reason: XRP would probably still be wrestling with its old Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit if November's presidential election had gone the other way.\n\nOthers see a precarious pricing situation, since XRP's $168 billion market cap isn't supported by a booming business. On Thursday, for instance, the RippleNet international payment system settled 674,000 transactions worth a total of $713 million. Not too shabby, at least when you extrapolate these figures to a dollar volume of roughly $260 billion and 260 million payments per year.\n\nBut RippleNet only collected 691 XRP tokens in fees, worth a total of approximately $1,900. That's just above $706,000 per year. That's...not a lot.\n\nI'm sure the business collects revenue in other ways, but Ripple is still a private organization and tight-lipped about its finances. Based on the ultra-modest XRP fees, however, the crypto's $168 billion market cap doesn't look so cheap anymore.\n\nThe real-world problem XRP is trying to solve\n\nI see a bright long-term future for RippleNet and XRP. Border-crossing payments are a very big business, and the solutions you see in traditional banking systems are often pricey and slow. If there ever were a financial service in need of a modern digital overhaul, international payments would be at the top of my list.",

      "text": "Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that aim to peg their value to another asset, most often a fiat currency. For example, a U.S. dollar stablecoin is designed to maintain a value of $1. Since most cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, stablecoins are an alternative for those who want a digital currency with a fixed value.\nIt's a common misconception that stablecoins are safe and can be counted on to maintain the intended value. Although that's the goal, they can lose their pegs, so they're not risk-free. Stablecoins serve a key role in the crypto market, but before you buy any, it's important to understand how they work.\nTypes of stablecoins\nTypes of stablecoins\nThere are four types of stablecoins:\n- Fiat-backed stablecoins\n- Crypto-backed stablecoins\n- Commodity-backed stablecoins\n- Algorithmic stablecoins\nAs you can see, it's the backing or collateral that determines the type of stablecoin. You'll find more details on each type below.\nFiat-backed stablecoins\nFiat-backed stablecoins have a fiat currency reserve. The reserves are collateral that guarantee the value of the stablecoin and should be equal in value to the circulating supply. For example, a fiat-backed U.S. dollar stablecoin with 1 million coins in circulation should have $1 million in reserves.\nThis type of stablecoin is normally safe if the organization managing it has sufficient reserves. To verify its reserves, the organization should provide regular audits by an independent third party.\nFiat Currency\nCrypto-backed stablecoins\nCrypto-backed stablecoins have cryptocurrency reserves. They generally use one of the larger cryptocurrencies as collateral, such as Bitcoin (BTC 0.12%) or Ethereum (CRYPTO:ETH).\nSince cryptocurrencies are volatile, this type of stablecoin needs to be over-collateralized. Its reserves should be significantly greater in value than its circulating supply to account for price fluctuations.\nCommodity-backed stablecoins\nCommodity-backed stablecoins have reserves made up of physical assets, such as precious metals, real estate, and oil. The most common type of commodities used to back stablecoins are precious metals, specifically gold.\nThis type of stablecoin is pegged to its reserve asset. For example, a gold-backed stablecoin would be pegged to the value of gold. The advantage for investors is that they can purchase digital versions of commodities without needing to obtain or store the actual physical asset.\nAlgorithmic stablecoins\nAlgorithmic stablecoins control the circulating supply using algorithms and smart contracts. They may not have reserves, and, if they do, they're typically under-collateralized. Algorithms reduce the supply if the stablecoin's price is lower than the asset it tracks and mint more coins if it's higher. It's similar to how central banks operate by printing and destroying fiat money.\nThese stablecoins are riskier because they don't have sufficient reserves to dip into if they face issues. TerraUSD (USTC 1.4%) is a famous example of how this can go wrong. This algorithmic stablecoin lost its peg in May 2022, and the value plummeted.\nWhat makes stablecoins unique?\nWhat makes stablecoins unique?\nThe thing that makes stablecoins different is that they mimic another asset's value. Other cryptocurrencies have prices based on what they offer and market demand; stablecoin prices depend on the asset they're following.\nThis gives stablecoins some advantages over traditional cryptocurrencies. Most notably, a stablecoin is much better suited for being an actual digital currency that you can store, transfer, or use to pay for goods and services. Because it has a stable value, you don't need to worry about price fluctuations.\nWhere stablecoins came from\nWhere stablecoins came from\nJ.R. Willett, a member of the early Bitcoin community, is considered the inventor of stablecoins. He came up with the idea of asset-pegged cryptocurrencies in 2012 and mentioned it in the white paper for his MasterCoin protocol.\nThe first stablecoin was BitUSD, a crypto-backed stablecoin that launched in 2014. It lost its peg to the U.S. dollar in 2018 and never recovered. The first fiat-backed stablecoin, Tether (USDT 0.01%), launched later in 2014. Although it has gone through some controversies and price fluctuations, for the most part Tether has maintained its peg.\nHow stablecoins work\nHow stablecoins work\nMost stablecoins maintain reserves. The organization behind a stablecoin adds to the reserves when it mints new coins.\nIt's easiest to explain by using an example. A fiat-backed U.S. dollar stablecoin, such as USD Coin (USDC -0.0%), needs reserves equal to the number of coins it has in circulation. It can maintain reserves by increasing and reducing the supply as people buy and sell their coins.\nLet's say you decide to buy $100 in USD Coin. The $100 you pay is added to that stablecoin's reserves, and 100 USDC is minted and sent to you. If you decide to sell your 100 USDC, they'll be bought back using $100 from the reserves and then removed from circulation.\nThere are many stablecoins out there, and they don't all work the same way, but the general idea is usually the same. Whether a stablecoin is backed by fiat money, crypto, or a commodity, funds are added to the reserves as coins are minted. The exception is an algorithmic stablecoin since it relies on algorithms instead of a reserve system.\nStablecoin and crypto research\nStablecoin and crypto research\nStablecoin examples\nStablecoin examples\nHere are a few prominent examples of stablecoins:\n- Tether is a U.S. dollar stablecoin. It's the largest stablecoin by market cap and normally has the highest daily trading volume of any cryptocurrency.\n- USD Coin is a U.S. dollar stablecoin and the first cryptocurrency chosen by Visa (V 0.59%) for settling transactions.\n- PAX Gold (PAXG 0.05%) is a gold-backed stablecoin designed to make gold more easily tradeable.\n- Dai (DAI -0.01%) is a crypto-backed U.S. dollar stablecoin. It's managed by MakerDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization.\nCan I make passive income with stablecoins?\nCan I make passive income with stablecoins?\nYou can make passive income with stablecoins through crypto lending programs. Stablecoins, especially those that follow fiat currencies, are popular choices for lending because of their stable prices. Since a stablecoin's value won't drop -- assuming it doesn't lose its peg -- it's safer to lend out than other types of cryptocurrencies.\nKeep in mind that crypto lending has its risks. Most crypto lending programs stipulate in their terms that they're not responsible for lost funds. If borrowers default, you could lose money.\nUnique risks\nUnique risks\nThe biggest danger with stablecoins is that they're not guaranteed to maintain their pegs. It's easy to fall into the trap of assuming a stablecoin will always have the same value as the asset it follows, but plenty of stablecoins have failed over the years.\nTerraUSD is a cautionary tale that illustrates what can go wrong with stablecoins. It was part of the Terra (LUNA 2.78%) ecosystem, and it attracted a huge number of investors because of Terra's Anchor Protocol. Anchor was like a savings account that offered users an APY of almost 20% on their TerraUSD deposits.\nIt worked out well until TerraUSD lost its peg during a period of heavy market volatility. The price dropped from $1 to less than $0.20 in a matter of days and eventually fell below $0.02. Investors who had put their life savings in TerraUSD lost almost everything.\nThat's (almost) a worst-case scenario, and there are more secure stablecoins. However, the bottom line is that no stablecoin is 100% secure. There's no guarantee that a stablecoin will always be exchangeable for the asset it's pegged to, and you don't get the same protections from stablecoins that you do from money in a bank account.\nAre stablecoins a good investment?\nAre stablecoins a good investment?\nStablecoins generally aren't investments, but they can be a good choice for investors who want to build passive income streams.\nSince stablecoins aim to maintain a set value, they aren't made for investing. The price of a stablecoin will ideally be the same in the future as it is today, in which case whatever you buy will be worth the same as when you bought it. If you're interested in cryptocurrency investing, you're better off buying coins that could increase in value.\nWhere stablecoins work very well is generating passive income through crypto lending. Crypto lending programs often pay high interest rates on stablecoins. Make sure to spend plenty of time researching both the stablecoin and the lending program to evaluate the security they offer.\nStablecoins are also a convenient way to invest in digital representations of commodities. Let's say you've decided to invest in precious metals and want to add gold to your portfolio. Instead of buying and storing gold bars, you could invest in a gold-backed stablecoin. Once again, it's important to research any commodity-backed stablecoins you're thinking of buying.\nHow to buy stablecoins\nHow to buy stablecoins\nIf you want to buy stablecoins and you have an account with a cryptocurrency exchange, check which options your exchange has available. Many of the biggest crypto exchanges sell at least one or two U.S. dollar stablecoins. The fastest option is buying on an exchange where you're already signed up.\nIf you want a specific stablecoin, check which exchanges have it available. Motley Fool Money, a Motley Fool site, provides information on cryptocurrency availability at major exchanges. This can help you track down the exchanges that carry stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies you want.\nThe best way to look at buying stablecoins is that you're really buying the organization that issues the stablecoin. You're trusting that organization to keep the value of the coin where it should be. Before you buy, spend time learning about the organization's reputation and review how the stablecoin maintains its peg."

      "text": "You may wonder what makes cryptocurrency valuable, given that it's notoriously volatile. It's not uncommon for Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC) to increase or decrease in price by 5% or even 10% on any given day. Smaller cryptocurrencies can have even wider price swings.\nAfter reading this article, you'll have a better understanding of what makes cryptocurrency valuable and why the price might swing violently within a single day.\nUnderstanding the value of a cryptocurrency\nUnderstanding the value of a cryptocurrency\nCryptocurrencies usually aren't backed by any central authority in the same fashion as fiat currencies or another government-sanctioned medium of exchange. Government backing can improve faith in the value of a currency among consumers, and it provides a big spender and collector of the currency. (Try paying your taxes in Bitcoin.) But since cryptocurrencies are generally decentralized, they derive their value from other sources, including:\n- Supply and demand\n- Cost of production\n- Availability on exchanges\n- Competition\n- Governance\n- Regulations\nLaw of Supply and Demand\nCryptocurrency supply and demand\nCryptocurrency supply and demand\nThe value of cryptocurrency is determined by supply and demand, just like anything else that people want. If demand increases faster than supply, the price goes up. For example, if there's a drought, the price of grain and produce increases if demand doesn't change. The same supply and demand principle applies to cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency gains value when demand rises higher than supply.\nThe supply mechanism of a cryptocurrency is always known; each crypto publishes its token minting and burning plans. Some, such as Bitcoin, have a fixed maximum supply; we know that there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins. Others, like Ether (CRYPTO:ETH), have no cap on supply. Some cryptocurrencies have mechanisms that \"burn\" existing tokens to prevent the circulating supply from growing too large and slowing inflation. Burning a token means sending them to an unrecoverable address on the blockchain.\nThe monetary policy of each cryptocurrency is different. Bitcoin supply increases by a fixed amount with each new block mined on the blockchain. Ethereum offers a fixed reward per block mined, but it also pays out for including \"uncle blocks\" in the new block, which helps facilitate the efficiency of the blockchain. As a result, the supply increase isn't as fixed. Some cryptocurrency supplies are dictated entirely by the team in charge of a project, which can opt to release more of a token to the public or burn tokens to manage the money supply.\nDemand can increase as a project gains awareness or as utility increases. Broader adoption of a cryptocurrency as an investment also increases demand while effectively limiting the circulating supply. For example, when institutional investors started buying and holding Bitcoin in early 2021, the price of Bitcoin increased significantly as demand outstripped the pace at which new coins were created, effectively decreasing the total available supply of Bitcoin.\nLikewise, as more decentralized finance (DeFi) projects launch on the Ethereum blockchain, the demand for Ether increases. Ether is required to perform transactions on the blockchain regardless of what cryptocurrency you're transacting with. Or, if a DeFi project takes off itself, its own token will become more useful, thereby increasing demand.\nCost of production\nCost of production\nNew cryptocurrency tokens are produced through a process called mining. Mining for cryptocurrency involves using a computer to verify the next block on the blockchain. The decentralized network of miners is what allows cryptocurrency to work as it does. In exchange, the protocol produces a reward in the form of cryptocurrency tokens, in addition to any fees paid by the exchanging parties to the miners.\nVerifying the blockchain requires computing power. Participants invest in expensive equipment and electricity in order to mine cryptocurrency. In a proof-of-work system, like those used by Bitcoin and Ethereum, the more competition there is for mining a certain cryptocurrency, the more difficult it is to mine. That's because miners essentially race each other to solve a complex math problem in order to verify a block. As such, the cost to mine increases as more powerful equipment is needed to successfully mine.\nAs mining costs increase, it necessitates an increased value of the cryptocurrency. Miners won't mine if the value of the currency they're mining isn't high enough to offset their costs. And, since miners are essential to making the blockchain function, as long as there's demand for using the blockchain, the price will have to go up.\nLiquidity Mining\nCryptocurrency exchanges\nCryptocurrency exchanges\nMainstream cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether trade on multiple exchanges. Just about any cryptocurrency exchange will list the most popular tokens.\nBut some smaller tokens may only be available on select exchanges, thus limiting access for some investors. Some wallet providers will aggregate quotes for swapping any set of cryptocurrencies across several exchanges, but they'll take a fee for doing so, increasing the cost of investing. Furthermore, if a cryptocurrency is thinly traded on a small exchange, the spread the exchange takes may be too big for some investors.\nIf a cryptocurrency becomes listed on more exchanges, it can increase the number of investors willing and able to buy it, thus increasing demand. And, all else being equal, as demand increases, the price goes up.\nCompetition\nCompetition\nThere are thousands of different cryptocurrencies in existence, with new projects and tokens launching every day. The barrier to entry is relatively low for new competitors, but creating a viable cryptocurrency also relies on building a network of users of that cryptocurrency.\nA useful application on the blockchain can quickly build a network, especially if it improves upon a limitation of a competing application. If a new competitor gains momentum, it takes value from the existing competition, thus sending the price of the incumbent down as the new competitor's token sees its price move higher.\nInternal governance\nInternal governance\nCryptocurrency networks rarely abide by a static set of rules. Developers adapt projects based on the community that uses them. Some tokens -- called governance tokens -- give their holders a say in the future of a project, including how a token is mined or used. In order to make any changes to the governance of a token, there needs to be consensus among stakeholders.\nFor example, Ethereum is working to update its network from a proof-of-work system to a proof-of-stake system, effectively rendering much of the expensive mining equipment in data centers or people's basements useless. That will undoubtedly have an impact on the value of Ether.\nGenerally speaking, investors like stable governance. Even if there are flaws in the way a cryptocurrency operates, investors prefer the devil they know to the devil they don't. As such, stable governance where things are relatively hard to change can be of value by providing more stable pricing.\nOn the other hand, the slow process of updating software to improve protocols can limit the upside of cryptocurrency values. If an update would unlock value for cryptocurrency holders but takes months to execute, it hurts the current stakeholders.\nRegulations and legal requirements\nRegulations and legal requirements\nThere's some confusion about who should regulate the exchange of cryptocurrencies. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) says cryptocurrencies are securities like stocks and bonds, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) says they're commodities like coffee or gold.\nBoth can't claim regulatory authority over cryptocurrency exchanges. A determining ruling could provide greater clarity and improve cryptocurrency values while opening the door for more widely traded crypto-related financial products.\nRegulation is required to allow for easier ways to trade cryptocurrency. Products such as ETFs or futures contracts provide more access to cryptocurrency for investors, increasing its value. Additionally, regulation could enable investors to take short positions or bet against the price of cryptocurrencies with futures contracts or options. That should produce better price discovery and reduce the volatility of cryptocurrency pricing.\nRegulations could also negatively impact demand for cryptocurrency. If a governing body changes the rules to disfavor cryptocurrency investment or use, it could send the price of cryptocurrencies lower.\nRelated Crypto Topics\nFinding value in cryptocurrency\nFinding value in cryptocurrency\nIf you understand the core principle of supply and demand behind what gives cryptocurrency value and the factors influencing them, you can make better cryptocurrency investment decisions. If you believe demand is going to increase for reasons X, Y, and Z and don't think supply will keep up, that cryptocurrency could be a good investment. But be aware that governments still don't have best practices for regulating cryptocurrency, which makes it a particularly risky and volatile investment no matter what."

  "argos_summary": "XRP\u2019s $168\u202fbillion market cap appears overvalued given its modest fee revenue, prompting calls for a price correction. The coin has seen extreme volatility in 2025, rising 421\u202f% year\u2011to\u2011date, but analysts weigh bullish catalysts such as RLUSD, pending ETF approvals, and a crypto\u2011friendly US administration against concerns over the SEC lawsuit and low fee income. While RippleNet processes large cross\u2011border volumes, its fee revenue (~$1.9\u202fm annually) is negligible relative to the cap, suggesting a potential upside\u2011down or a need for a price reset before 2025 ends. The article also provides a primer on stablecoins, explaining types, peg mechanisms, and regulatory considerations.",
