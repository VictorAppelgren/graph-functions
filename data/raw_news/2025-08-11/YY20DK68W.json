  "title": "A revolution is happening at Liverpool. It is unusual for them and a rarity for champions",
  "description": "Premier League winners rarely make huge waves in the transfer market but Arne Slot's side have decided to build from a position of strength",
  "content": "When Arne Slot eventually emerged from Liverpool\u2019s dressing room after their final game of last season, a big smile on his face and celebratory songs still ringing in his ears, he was inevitably asked about how he planned to build on their Premier League title success.\n\n\u201cRadical changes, you will probably not see,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cThat (radical change) would be a bit weird if you won the league.\u201d\n\nIt was a response in keeping both with his own reputation and that of a club that has shown far more restraint in the transfer market than most of its rivals in recent years, both in the amount of money spent and the number of players signed.\n\nBut what has followed this summer can certainly be classed as radical, not just by Liverpool\u2019s standards but also by those of title-winning teams more widely. They have signed Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong, Milos Kerkez and Hugo Ekitike for a combined total in excess of \u00a3250million ($338m) and are still pursuing Newcastle United forward Alexander Isak for what would be a British record transfer fee some way beyond their \u00a3116m deal for Wirtz.\n\nEven without Isak for now, Liverpool have been the biggest spenders in the Premier League so far this summer, albeit with around \u00a3168m ($226m) recouped via the sales of Luis Diaz, Darwin Nunez, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Caoimhin Kelleher, Jarell Quansah and others. By the time the transfer window closes on September 1, they hope to have signed Isak and a new central defender, such as Parma youngster Giovanni Leoni, while Kostas Tsimikas, Harvey Elliott and Federico Chiesa are likely to have been moved on.\n\nOnly once since the turn of the century (in 2018) have Liverpool been the biggest spenders in the Premier League\u2019s summer transfer market, but it is from a broader perspective that the Merseyside club\u2019s approach is more interesting.\n\nYou would have to go back to 2019 \u2014 and Manchester City, with a fast-improving Liverpool at their heels \u2014 to find the last summer that the previous season\u2019s champions topped the Premier League\u2019s spending table. Before that? Manchester United, with the signings of Owen Hargreaves, Anderson, Nani and Carlos Tevez in 2007.\n\nChampions do not usually make the biggest waves in the summer transfer market; indeed, according to the figures on Transfermarkt, on only three other occasions since the mid-2000s (Chelsea in 2010 and 2017 and Manchester City in 2023) have the reigning champions even been among the three biggest summer spenders.\n\nNote the emphasis on \u201csummer\u201d here. There have been various instances when a club has shown restraint in the summer after a title triumph but felt compelled to spend big in the mid-season transfer window in an attempt to recover from an unexpected slump. Manchester City last season was a stark example of the genre: quiet summer, alarming collapse, \u00a3180m-plus outlay on five new players in January. Non-buyer\u2019s remorse, you might call it.\n\nNobody can accuse Liverpool of resting on their laurels since last season\u2019s title success. Indeed, the more common accusation this summer has been that they have been too active in looking to strengthen in attacking positions in particular. Their former defender Jamie Carragher sounded genuinely troubled when he said on the Overlap YouTube channel last week, with regard to going for Isak even after the signing of Ekitike, that \u201cit doesn\u2019t feel Liverpool-like to me\u201d.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t, in the sense that it seems\u2026 well, to use Slot\u2019s word, radical. This is a club that has, for the most part, restricted itself to no more than a handful of additions to the first-team squad before each season and sometimes fewer than that \u2014 only Chiesa last summer, only Ibrahima Konate in 2021, only a couple of back-up goalkeepers in 2019. Despite breaking the world record for fees spent on a defender (Virgil van Dijk) and goalkeeper (Alisson) in the space of eight months in 2018, they have largely steered clear of the very top end of the transfer market under Fenway Sports Group\u2019s ownership.\n\nThis summer\u2019s approach, led by sporting director Richard Hughes, has been very different. To commit to a British record fee to sign Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen was a powerful statement of intent, but few would have imagined, after the captures of Frimpong and Kerkez, that they would follow up with a projected \u00a379m deal to sign Ekitike from Eintracht Frankfurt and still muscle their way to the front of the queue for Isak, should Newcastle be persuaded to sell their unsettled Swedish centre-forward.\n\nIf it is radical, it is because, unusually for a title-winning team, a revolution of sorts was overdue. Over the previous six years, their transfer expenditure was not just way below the other \u201cBig Six\u201d clubs (Chelsea, Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal in that order) but also less than what was spent by West Ham United, Newcastle, Brighton & Hove Albion and Wolverhampton Wanderers. In that context, last season\u2019s title success, so soon after Slot took over from Jurgen Klopp, was somewhat unexpected.\n\nIn his book How to Win the Premier League, Liverpool\u2019s former director of research Ian Graham cites the club\u2019s success in integrating three new signings into the first-team squad in each of their first four seasons under Klopp\u2019s management: Nathaniel Clyne, James Milner and Roberto Firmino in 2015-16 (when Klopp replaced Brendan Rodgers after the campaign began), Joel Matip, Georginio Wijnaldum and Sadio Mane in 2016-17, Andy Robertson, Mohamed Salah and Van Dijk in 2017-18 and Alisson, Fabinho and Naby Keita in 2018-19.\n\nThere were some significant acquisitions in the years that followed (Thiago Alcantara and Diogo Jota in 2020, Konate in 2021, Diaz in January 2022, Nunez in the summer of 2022, Cody Gakpo in January 2023) but not enough, it seemed, to give Klopp the best chance of building on the 2020 title triumph. An ageing midfield department was neglected until the summer of 2023, when Fabinho, Jordan Henderson, Milner, Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all departed and Wataru Endo, Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch and Dominik Szoboszlai arrived.\n\nStability has served Liverpool well, but the risk of stagnation always loomed in the background, testing even Klopp\u2019s famed energy and powers of motivation. That was seen in the gradual deterioration of their midfield unit prior to the 2023 overhaul. That same risk has applied to their defence, with Konate and Tsimikas the only significant new additions between Van Dijk (January 2018) and Frimpong and Kerkez (this summer). The ages of Van Dijk and Robertson, plus the fact Alexander-Arnold has left for Real Madrid and Konate has yet to extend his contract beyond next summer, underline the need for change, as evidenced so far by the signings of Frimpong and Kerkez and the interest in Leoni, 18, who broke into Parma\u2019s team last season.\n\nThere is a compelling argument that Liverpool\u2019s summer activity, while radical by their standards, has not yet gone far enough. More central-defensive cover looks like a matter of urgency. As imperious as Van Dijk is, he is 34 and cannot be expected to maintain that standard indefinitely; Konate is in the final year of his contract and, although he achieved a personal record of 31 Premier League appearances last season, his playing time had to be managed carefully by Slot to minimise the threat of injury; Joe Gomez is the club\u2019s longest-serving player, but his number of Premier League starts over the past five campaigns (six, four, 15, 17, six) point to the risk of taking his availability for granted. In that context, the decision to sell Quansah to Leverkusen was a surprising one, even if the 22-year-old felt frustrated by his lack of playing time.\n\nOn one hand, the pursuit of Isak, on top of the Ekitike deal, might look like an indulgence too far. On the other hand, Liverpool went into last season with six senior forwards (Salah, Chiesa, Jota, Nunez, Diaz, Gakpo) to cover three positions in the front line. At present, they have only four (Salah, Chiesa, Gakpo, Ekitike) and nobody would be surprised if Chiesa follows Diaz and Nunez in leaving before the transfer deadline on September 1. As talented as Ben Doak, 19, and Rio Ngumoha, 16, certainly are, there is a clear deficit in proven front-line experience even if Chiesa ends up staying.\n\nIt still feels horribly insensitive to discuss the death of Jota and his brother Andre Silva, in a car crash in Spain on July 3, in terms of anything other than the immense loss felt on a human level. But while his No 20 shirt has been retired in his honour, the brutal reality is that leaving a vacancy in the forward line has not been an option for Liverpool \u2014 particularly not with Diaz and Nunez having been sold to Bayern Munich and Al Hilal respectively. In an ideal world, they might not have gone for both Ekitike and Isak in the same transfer window. This summer\u2019s circumstances have been the opposite of that: tragic, harrowing, traumatic.\n\nNobody can know how Liverpool players might be affected, individually or collectively, by the loss of Jota. Van Dijk has talked of the team\u2019s wish to honour their former team-mate\u2019s memory \u201ceach and every day\u201d and to \u201ccarry on his legacy\u201d while supporting his family in every way they can. That commitment comes with a heavy emotional burden, even if it is shared. Of all the threats to their title defence, grief is perhaps the most unpredictable.\n\nIt cannot go unmentioned that Jota\u2019s frequent game-changing contributions on the pitch will be missed too. So will the match-winning qualities of Alexander-Arnold, Diaz and, though they were spasmodic, Nunez. Nor is the ease with which Kelleher and Quansah stepped up to deputise for Alisson and Konate respectively at times last season likely to be underestimated by anyone, least of all Slot. Elliott did not start a Premier League game last term until after the title was won, but he was highly effective as a substitute on occasions.\n\nA title-winning club might typically focus on upgrading one or two positions in the starting line-up and one or two more peripheral signings; a fairly typical example would be Manchester City in the summer of 2019 (midfielder Rodri from Atletico Madrid for \u00a362.8m and full-back Joao Cancelo from Juventus in a swap deal valued at \u00a360m, plus a back-up goalkeeper, Zak Steffen, and left-back, Angelino) or 2022 (Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund for \u00a351.2m, plus Stefan Ortega, Manuel Akanji, Sergio Gomez and Kalvin Phillips) or indeed Liverpool in the summer of 2020 (Tsmikas as cover at left-back, Thiago as a high-quality addition in midfield and Jota to add more variety to a forward line that had been so reliant on Salah, Mane and Firmino).\n\nThe unprecedented scale of this summer\u2019s changes at Anfield reflect a range of events and circumstances: most obviously the Jota tragedy, but also Alexander-Arnold\u2019s departure, after running down his contract, and the feeling on all sides that this was the right time for Quansah, Diaz and Nunez to move on \u2014 as it might also prove to be for Tsimikas and Elliott.\n\nBeyond that, there is a desire, shared by Hughes and Slot, to rebuild, rejuvenate and re-energise the squad and to bring in players of a higher calibre, particularly in creative areas. As Slot put it after defeat by Crystal Palace on penalties in the Community Shield on Sunday: \u201cLast season, we had a lot of ball possession, but that didn\u2019t always lead to promising situations.\u201d With Wirtz, Ekitike and others on board, he said: \u201cWe are better in creating and getting promising situations than we were, in my opinion, throughout the whole of last season.\u201d\n\nThat might be a terrifying thought for the rest of the Premier League, given that Liverpool scored 14 more goals than the next most prolific team (Manchester City) last season and that they still hope to add Isak to their attacking options. The prospect of Wirtz as a creative foil for Salah, Ekitike and Isak is mouthwatering. But it is also possible to imagine that a more expansive approach might leave gaps that opposition teams can exploit, as Palace did at Wembley on Sunday.\n\nThere is a strange contradiction about all of this: that although Slot surpassed every expectation as a newcomer to the Premier League last season by refining and improving the squad he inherited from Klopp with only one low-key addition (Chiesa), he perhaps faces a more complicated challenge in year two \u2014 in terms of managing change and finding the right balance \u2014 with a squad that aligns more closely to his technical and tactical vision.\n\nConventional thinking usually dictates restraint after winning a league title \u2014 nothing too dramatic, nothing too radical.\n\nBut then again, the same conventional thinking demanded action last summer when there was so much pressure on Hughes and Slot to make an immediate impression. Instead, they embraced stability. By doing so, they ensured that this summer would be about inviting and embracing change and all the unknowns \u2014 some of them exciting, some of them unnerving \u2014 that come with it. It is radical, but it is, unusually, a revolution being conducted from a position of strength and trust.",

  "summary": "Liverpool is undergoing a significant transformation in the transfer market, following their Premier League title success last season, with a radical transformation under the ownership of Fenway Sports Group. The club has signed Florian Wirtz, Jeremie Frimpong, Milos Kerkez and Hugo Ekitike for over \u00a3250m ($338m), and is still pursuing Newcastle United forward Alexander Isak for a British record transfer fee of \u00a3116m. Despite this, Liverpool has been the biggest spender in the Premier League so far this summer, with around \u00a3168m ($226m) recouped through the sales of Luis Diaz, Darwin Nunez, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Caoimhin Kelleher, Jarell Quansah and others. The team's approach to the summer transfer market has been seen as a departure from their previous cautious approach. Despite breaking the world record for world record defender (Virgil van Dijk) and goalkeeper (Alisson) fees in the space of eight months, Liverpool's approach has been more cautious than any other champions.",

      "text": "At the start, you hope it cannot be true, that it has all been a terrible misunderstanding and that something will pop up online to let us know that the internet is a wicked place when it comes to the distribution of fake news.\nBut then the reports start to accelerate and, waking up to the news about Diogo Jota, you realise there has been nothing on his social media accounts since the wedding photographs that he posted, lovingly, heartbreakingly, just a few hours before his life was taken away.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cA day we will never forget,\u201d Jota had written alongside a video montage from the ceremony in Porto, the Portuguese city where he and his childhood sweetheart, Rute Cardoso, fell in love.\nOne photograph shows the happy couple showing off their wedding rings. Another shows confetti fluttering in the air as they leave the church, waving to family and friends.\nView this post on Instagram\nAnother photo shows the newlyweds with their three children \u2014 two sons and a baby daughter, all aged under four \u2014 and it isn\u2019t easy, seeing how happy they all were, to find the words that could ever possibly sum up all the different, jarring emotions attached to the events of the last 24 hours.\nIt is only a few weeks since those kids were allowed on the pitch at Anfield to join in with Liverpool\u2019s title celebrations after the final game of the Premier League season.\nJota had worn the No 20 shirt in the year that Liverpool won their 20th league championship. He and Rute, both 28, gathered their children for a family photograph in front of the Kop. Somebody brought over the trophy and the crowd cheered as the two boys, Denis and Duarte, both wearing Liverpool shirts, took turns trying to lift it off the ground.\nAnd now, just 11 days since the wedding, other photos have made their way online from the devastating crash scene near Cernadilla, in north-west Spain, showing the burnt-out wreckage of the light-green Lamborghini Huracan that had come off the road around 00.30am, local time, on Thursday.\nIf there was any decency, these photographs would be available only to the accident investigators and emergency workers. In the modern world, however, they had started to go viral even before the bodies of Jota and his brother, Andre Silva, had been formally identified.\nInvestigators are working to the theory that the car suffered a high-speed \u2018blowout\u2019 \u2014 a puncture to one of its rear tyres \u2014 and that when it crashed off the A-52 dual-carriageway into the central reservation, seemingly while overtaking a truck, the impact caused the vehicle to burst into flames. They accept that there may be multiple causes for the crash.\nThe A-52, otherwise known as the Rias Bajas highway, stretches almost 300 kilometres and the crash occurred on an unlit section, surrounded by hills and greenery, in an area that has been called \u201cempty Spain\u201d because it is so rural.\nAs for the state of the road, who can say at this early stage whether that was a contributing factor? The road surface has, however, been a subject of criticism. Photographs have shown large potholes on certain stretches and, at the scene, The Athletic was told that parts of the carriageway were so badly affected that ambulance drivers preferred to use only the fast (left) lane rather than crossing from one side to the other.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI am not going into the circumstances,\u201d Angel Blanco, a local government official, told reporters at a hastily arranged media conference. \u201cThe car overturned, the car was burnt and the result was lethal: two young people died. There has to be an investigation.\u201d\nJose Fernandez Blanco, the mayor of Puebla de Sanabria, told The Athletic: \"For a small town like ours, these tragedies are a source of consternation, anger that such young people, in the prime of their lives, have lost their lives.\n\"We express all our sorrow and sympathy for the family, the parents, the wife, the children. These are difficult tragedies to deal with. To talk about it now (the state of the road)... it is not the right time. It will be the time for the expert and police reports.\"\nJota and his brother had left Portugal and were heading towards Santander on Spain\u2019s northern coast. Their plan was to get some rest in Benavente, midway through the journey, and then resume the drive in time to board a ferry in Santander that would take Jota to England later on Thursday.\nIt would have been a 300-mile drive, taking almost six hours, and the average ferry journey is 30 hours to Portsmouth on the south coast of England, still a considerable distance from Liverpool in the north west.\nWhy did he not fly, as would ordinarily be expected? That was because Jota had recently undergone some sort of surgery and, as such, the doctors had advised him to travel by ferry rather than the air.\nAs it was, they never made it as far as Benavente. The force of the collision took the Lamborghini through the roadside barriers. Trapped inside the burning wreckage, both men were declared dead at the scene.\nOfficials in Liverpool\u2019s media department started taking calls from journalists at around 9am and, understandably, there was not a great deal they could say at first.\nAdvertisement\nStaff had only scant details, as well as having to cope with their own grief. Message after message, call after call, was coming in. But everything had to be checked, and double-checked, before the club could make any comment and, uppermost in their minds, they knew there was a grieving family trying to take in the worst possible news.\nUnfortunately for Liverpool, they have experience when it comes to public statements that combine feelings of extreme shock and horror.\nThis was supposed to be the summer of all summers for everyone connected with the club, basking in the warm afterglow of a title triumph and free, it seemed, to lap it all up without the restrictions that were put in force because of Covid-19 on the last occasion they finished as champions.\nInstead, it might be remembered as the most challenging and traumatic summer since the horrors at Hillsborough in 1989 and the fatal crush, with the loss of 97 lives, that caused Britain\u2019s worst sporting disaster.\nFirst, there was the title parade on May 26 when a car ploughed into the crowd in Liverpool city centre, injuring more than 100 people and resulting in a local man being charged with multiple offences alleging he had used the vehicle \u201cas a weapon\u201d.\nThen, just a few days before the first batch of players were due to report for pre-season training, the first reports started to filter through that something terrible had happened, more than 1,000 miles away, in the middle of the night.\nJota had been given extra time off because of his involvement in Portugal\u2019s triumphant UEFA Nations League campaign. He was a substitute on June 4 when Portugal beat the host nation, Germany, in the semi-final. Then, in the final against Spain four days later, he came off the bench again, making his 49th international appearance.\nPortugal won via a penalty shootout and it was typical of Jota that, amid the celebrations, he devoted so much of his time to greeting the families and friends of other players and members of staff. One of those guests was disabled and he, in particular, was touched by Jota being so kind and welcoming. It was not a slight on the other players, but nobody was more generous with their time.\nAdvertisement\nWith the wedding as well it had been a wonderful summer for him and his family. Life was good. He and his brother were reported to have eaten at Leca da Palmeira, just north of Porto along the Portuguese coast. Then, at an unspecified time, they set off on their long journey across the border.\nThe statement Liverpool released at 10.23am the following day described the club as \u201cdevastated\u201d and requested that \u201cthe privacy of Diogo and Andre\u2019s family, friends, team-mates and club staff is respected as they try to come to terms with an unimaginable loss\u201d.\nAnfield\u2019s flags were lowered to half-mast. A book of condolence was opened and staff, including Jota\u2019s team-mates, were offered well-being support. The shop and museum will remain closed until Monday and none of the stadium tours will take place during that time.\nSilva, 25, was an attacking midfielder for FC Penafiel in Portugal's second division. He, too, was on his summer break, having last played in a 0-0 draw against Chaves on May 15. \u201cThe loss of two young lives so closely linked to the world of football fills us with pain and dismay,\u201d his club said.\nIn the Spanish province of Zamora, meanwhile, the two bodies had been taken to the Institute of Legal Medicine, where DNA tests were carried out to formalise what everyone, by this stage, already knew was true.\nThose tests had to be sent off to a specialist laboratory in Madrid \u2014 hence the delay in being able to make everything official \u2014 and the bodies were later transferred to a morgue in Puebla de Sanabria.\nSpecialist counsellors were brought in to support the relatives, including Rute, who had travelled from Portugal to be there. Her husband\u2019s agent, Joao Camacho, from Jorge Mendes\u2019 Gestifute organisation, was among those grieving with the family. Mendes arrived in the evening and, visibly emotional, told The Athletic: \"I still don't believe it, I still don't believe it, this is very difficult, very difficult for me. He was a great husband, a great husband and a great professional.\"\nAdvertisement\n\u201cWhat can anyone say at a time like this when the shock and the pain is so incredibly raw?\u201d Arne Slot, the Liverpool manager, asked in a statement of his own. \u201cI wish I had the words, but I know I do not. All I have are feelings that so many people will share, about a person and a player we loved dearly and a family we care so much about.\u201d\nTributes had poured in from all around the world, from the Portuguese prime minister to Cristiano Ronaldo, from Kenny Dalglish to Jurgen Klopp, from clubs that would ordinarily be considered rivals and, of course, from former colleagues and friends at Wolverhampton Wanderers, Jota\u2019s previous club.\nHere, though, it felt important that the current head coach of Liverpool should be seen and heard on behalf of a footballer he described as \u201cthe essence of what a Liverpool player should be\u201d.\nJota, Slot said, was \u201cthe person who never sought popularity but found it anyway\u201d. He was \u201cnot a friend to two people, a friend to everyone\u201d and \u201csomeone who made others feel good about themselves just by being with them\u201d.\nAbove all, he was a family man: a proud husband and a doting dad. And Slot knew that already, without needing to see the wedding pictures that have made this tragedy feel even more raw and distressing.\nA wake is expected to take place on Friday afternoon at Sao Cosme in Gondomar, just east of Porto, with the funeral at 10am the following day.\n\u201cThe last time we spoke, I congratulated Diogo on winning the Nations League and wished him luck for his forthcoming wedding,\u201d said Slot. \u201cIn many ways, it was a dream summer for Diogo and his family, which makes it all the more heartbreaking that it should end like this.\n\u201cMy condolences go to Diogo\u2019s wife, Rute, their three beautiful children and the parents of Diogo and Andre Silva.\n\u201cWhen the time is right, we will celebrate Diogo Jota, we will remember his goals and we will sing his song. For the time being, we will remember him as a unique human being and mourn his loss.\n\"He will never be forgotten.\u201d\nAn earlier version of this article stated Jota and his brother were travelling in a Lamborghini Urus.

      "text": "Newcastle have rejected a formal \u00a3110million offer from Liverpool for centre-forward Alexander Isak.\nIsak wants to leave Newcastle this summer and has been training at his former club, Real Sociedad, while Eddie Howe\u2019s squad are in South Korea as part of their pre-season tour of Asia.\nLiverpool had previously made an informal approach to their Premier League rivals and expressed an interest in doing a deal in the region of \u00a3120million, and the Anfield club have now seen an official bid worth a guaranteed \u00a3110m rebuffed.\nNewcastle have tried to tie Isak to an improved contract, which would have included a release clause next summer, and encouraged him to stay in the north east through senior team-mates. But the 25-year-old has not changed his stance, which has been made clear to the club by Isak and his representatives for some time.\nAdvertisement\nThe Sweden international spent three years at Real Sociedad before joining Newcastle for \u00a360million (\u20ac69.4m; $79.3m) in 2022 and has been training alone at the La Liga club\u2019s Zubieta facilities.\nSources, speaking anonymously as they were not authorised to do so publicly, said Isak\u2019s absence from Newcastle\u2019s pre-season tour was the player\u2019s preference amid his uncertain future. The club have cited a minor thigh injury for the forward.\nIsak\u2019s Newcastle contract has three years remaining, but they have now begun seeking potential replacements in case of his departure, although their stance has remained that he is not for sale.\nTheAthletic reported on July 15 that Liverpool had communicated interest in doing a deal in the region of \u00a3120m for the striker.\nThe Premier League champions later completed the signing of Hugo Ekitike, a player Newcastle also held interest in, from Eintracht Frankfurt in a deal worth an initial \u00a369m.\nThe St James\u2019 Park club made RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko their top candidate, but Manchester United are now prioritising a move for the 22-year-old. Newcastle have also held interest in Brentford\u2019s forward Yoane Wissa.\nIsak has established himself among the most prolific strikers in Europe in recent years. He scored 27 goals in all competitions last season, including one in the Carabao Cup final as Newcastle beat Liverpool 2-1 and ended their 70-year wait for a major domestic trophy.\nAnalysis: Liverpool are showing they mean business\nLiverpool have flexed their muscles all summer but this bid shows a real statement of intent.\nIt\u2019s no secret that the Premier League champions have admired Isak for some time, but solidifying that interest with an offer takes that to a new level. Isak is tried and tested in the top flight and Liverpool want to add him to an attacking department that will strike fear into every opponent.\nAdvertisement\nLast season\u2019s romp to the title was secured without the presence of regular goalscoring No 9 so it was a priority to improve that area this summer, and all along Isak has been the dream target.\nHow the pursuit of the Swedish striker plays out will be fascinating as Newcastle continue to stress that he is not for sale. Liverpool adopted a similar stance around Luis Diaz but were eventually persuaded to sell by Bayern Munich\u2019s persistence.\nThis opening bid is likely to be the start of a process that may only conclude if Newcastle receive an offer that is too good to turn down and source a suitable replacement.\nFor now, Liverpool have work to do if they are to get their man but already this summer they have shown they are able to get their top targets after striking deals to sign Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike among others.\nGregg Evans\nAnalysis: Newcastle\u2019s optimism is ebbing but Isak exit will not be straightforward\nThere has always been an understanding at this new version of Newcastle that selling good players was part of the business plan.\nBut nobody has wanted it to be Alexander Isak and nobody wants it to be now.\nDoes a formal bid from Liverpool for the Sweden international change Newcastle\u2019s message, which has always been that he is not for sale and that in an ideal world he would commit to a new contract?\nOn the face of it, not yet. Newcastle have rejected Liverpool\u2019s offer, although whether this stance is sustainable if Isak is determined to leave \u2014 which is very much how it appears \u2014 is less clear. There is not much optimism, however.\nWhat can be said with some certainty is that Liverpool\u2019s initial valuation of Isak does not come close to Newcastle\u2019s, which is in the region of \u00a3150million. And sources at St James\u2019 Park, speaking anonymously to protect their positions, are adamant he will not permitted to go until a striker of similar quality can be sourced.\nAdvertisement\nThat, of course, will not be straightforward. Newcastle have suffered some high-profile rejections already this summer; spending has been a problem.\nAnd, to come back to the start, the reason that nobody wanted Isak to be the first big player to leave is that he is pretty close to being irreplaceable. If he is to go, Newcastle have to make it on their terms as far as possible.\nGeorge Caulkin\n(Photo: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)"

  "argos_summary": "Liverpool manager Arne Slot has taken a radical approach to the summer transfer market following the club's Premier League title win, spending over \u00a3250 million on players like Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike, while pursuing Alexander Isak for a potential British record fee. This marks a significant shift from Liverpool's historically restrained spending habits, as they aim to rejuvenate their squad after the departures of key players. The club's aggressive recruitment strategy reflects a desire to strengthen their attacking options and address gaps in their defense, particularly in light of recent tragedies affecting the team.",
