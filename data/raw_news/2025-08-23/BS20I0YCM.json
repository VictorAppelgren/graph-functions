At the time, it was unclear if they were living there together ... but it still prompted engagement rumors.\nYet, a source close to the couple later shut down chatter the duo was getting married ... even though they were still very much an item.\nAlas, the former flames never took their relationship to the next level ... with Austin and Kaia being seen apart more and more in recent months.\nAs you know, Kaia joined her mom, supermodel Cindy Crawford, and her dad, Rande Gerber, for a family getaway to Cabo San Lucas to ring in 2025. While her brother, Presley Gerber, brought along his girlfriend, model Isabella Jones, for the vacay ... Austin was noticeably absent -- raising many an eyebrow, as he'd typically join them.\nNow we officially know why he skipped out on the fun in the sun.\nThe bright side of this split ... 2 of Hollywood's brightest stars are back on the market!!!\nWe've reached out to reps for both Austin & Kaia Gerber ... so far, no word back."

Instead, people deprived of sleep may experience issues such as blurry vision, eyestrain and trouble focusing. According to Healthline, stress or chronic stress can lead to psychogenic blindness, which the outlet noted usually happens after a traumatic event. Butler admitted to Men\u2019s Health that he once believed struggle was essential to his craft when he first began his acting career, and has suffered several health challenges as a result. In addition to migraines, he also dealt with pain in his foot that lasted for months after his press tour for 2024's Dune: Part Two and in 2021, he spent a week in the hospital due to appendicitis-like pain after filming Elvis.

      "text": "'Dune: Part Two': Everything to Know From the expected release date to the all-star cast, here's everything to know about the Dune sequel By Maggie Kreienberg Maggie Kreienberg Maggie Kreienberg is a senior editor at PEOPLE. She has been working at PEOPLE since 2022. Previously, she was an editor at Brides. People Editorial Guidelines Updated on February 15, 2024 12:31PM EST Credit : Warner bros. entertainment Prepare to re-enter the world of Dune. Shortly after the first Dune premiered in October 2021, production company Legendary confirmed that a sequel was already in the works. \"This is only the beginning...Thank you to those who have experienced @dunemovie so far, and those who are going in the days and weeks ahead,\" Legendary posted on Twitter, adding, \"We're excited to continue the journey!\" Like the first film, Dune: Part Two is an adaptation of Frank Herbert's 1965 novel of the same name, covering roughly the second half of the book. All-star cast members including lead character Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Zendaya, Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin will return in the sequel, alongside new faces like Austin Butler, Christopher Walken and Florence Pugh. \"Florence is really special,\" Chalamet told Variety of his new costar Pugh, whom he previously worked with on 2019's Little Women. \"She's an incredible actor. She was incredible in Dune \u2014 seriously incredible. She brought a gravitas to the role.\" Filming for Dune: Part Two wrapped in December 2022, but the release of the highly-anticipated movie was delayed until 2024 due to the strikes in Hollywood. At CinemaCon 2023 in April, it was revealed that Part Two was shot entirely in IMAX. From the official synopsis to the scheduled release date, here is everything to know about Dune: Part Two. What is Dune: Part Two about? Warner bros. entertainment Dune: Part Two picks up right where the first Dune film left off and is based on roughly the second half of Herbert's science fiction novel. According to the film's official synopsis, Dune: Part Two \"will explore the mythic journey of Paul Atreides [Chalamet] as he unites with Chani [Zendaya] and the Fremen while on a warpath of revenge against the conspirators who destroyed his family. Facing a choice between the love of his life and the fate of the known universe, he endeavors to prevent a terrible future only he can foresee.\" In February 2024, director Denis Villeneuve told Polygon that the sequel would be \"much more of an action movie.\" \"It allowed me \u2014 because the story is, in a way, more simple \u2014 to go deeper, and explore more, and the Fremen culture, and the Harkonnen culture,\" he said. Prior to filming, Bardem, who plays Stilgar, told audience members at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival that the sequel will \"surprise people\" \u2014 clarifying that fans will \"be surprised by the way they put it together.\" Zendaya is also expected to play a larger role in Dune: Part Two. Fans were previously disappointed by the star's limited screen time in the first film \u2014 her character, Chani, only appeared for about seven minutes total despite Dune's 2-hour-and-35-minute run time \u2014 but Villeneuve promised to \"develop some characters\" in the second installment. \"There are some characters that are less developed that I'm keeping for the second film \u2014 that's the way I found the equilibrium,\" Villeneuve told the Los Angeles Times in 2021. \"We tried in [Dune: Part One] to stay as close as possible to Paul's experience. Then, in the second one, I will have time to develop some characters that were left aside a little bit. That's the theory. I hope it will work.\" Who is in the cast of Dune: Part Two? Momodu Mansaray/Getty ; Michael Buckner/Variety ; Steve Granitz/WireImage Many A-list actors are set to reprise their roles in Dune: Part Two. The cast includes Chalamet, Zendaya, Brolin, Bardem, Dave Bautista, Rebecca Ferguson, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd and Charlotte Rampling. New cast members include Pugh as Princess Irulan; Walken as Emperor Shaddam IV; and Butler as Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, a member of the family that killed Paul's father in the first installment. L\u00e9a Seydoux will also appear in the highly-anticipated sequel as Lady Margot. Is there a trailer for Dune: Part Two? Warner Bros. released the first official trailer for Dune: Part 2 on May 3, 2023. The clip begins with Paul (Chalamet) sitting with Chani (Zendaya) in front of a sandy landscape. \"It's breathtaking,\" he says. \"When you see sand here, imagine water. If you dive in, you can't reach the bottom.\" The trailer offers a glimpse into action-packed scenes and gives a first look at Pugh as Princess Irulan and Butler as Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen. Two months later, the second official trailer dropped. The nearly three-minute teaser opens with Paul trying to convince Chani and the Fremen to join him in fighting the Harkonnens. The clip then cuts to the reunion between Paul and Gurney Halleck, played by Brolin.

Jeff Spicer/Jeff Spicer/Getty Denis Villeneuve directed and wrote Dune: Part Two. He also wrote and directed the 2021 adaption. During an appearance at CinemaCon 2023, Villeneuve shared that Part Two will pick up \"just where we left\" Chalamet and Ferguson's characters as Paul and his mother, Jessica, join the Fremen at the conclusion of the first film. After filming for Dune: Part One wrapped, Zendaya spoke about her experience working with Villeneuve to Empire. \"He's so kind and attentive to all of his actors,\" Zendaya said of the director, adding, \"Denis understands what he wants from us but he's also very collaborative, allowing me to have my take on the character as well. I don't want to jinx anything but I can't wait to explore her more. I hope I get to learn more from Denis. I love to learn from people who are great at their job.\" Zendaya isn't the only one who has positive things to say about Villeneuve. While promoting Dune: Part Two, Chalamet spoke with the Associated Press about his experience working with the director. \u201cDenis is so playful,\" he said. \"It\u2019s like the greatest evidence of self-confidence to me. It\u2019s ultimately a playful, creative exercise to get to direct any movie. The man who takes himself too seriously, is more focused on the people around him, the audience, than the actual product reeks of a movie that\u2019s pretentious.\u201d Other directorial credits for the Canadian filmmaker include Prisoners (2013), Arrival (2016) and Blade Runner 2049 (2017). Where was Dune: Part Two filmed? Chiabella James/Warner Bros According to Collider, the cast returned to Budapest, Abu Dhabi and Jordan to film the sequel. Parts of the upcoming movie were also filmed in Italy, marking a new location for Dune. Filming for Dune: Part Two wrapped in December 2022 and actor Brolin celebrated the feat on Instagram. \"Dune did it,\" he wrote alongside a mirror selfie. When will Dune: Part Two be released? Chiabella James/Warner Bros Dune: Part Two is slated to premiere on March 1, 2024. Close Read more: Entertainment Movies Action Movies"
