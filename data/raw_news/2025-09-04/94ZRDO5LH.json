  "description": "Wide receiver Amari Cooper intends to retire from the NFL shortly after signing with the Raiders, the team that drafted him fourth overall in 2015.",
  "content": "Veteran NFL wide receiver Amari Cooper has informed the Las Vegas Raiders that he no longer wants to play football and intends to retire ahead of the 2025 season.\n\nCooper, who has played for the Cleveland Browns, Dallas Cowboys and Buffalo Bills, began his career with the Raiders, which made signing with the team just over a week ago especially meaningful. He said he had some juice left in the tank to continue playing.\n\nBut before Week 1 began, the NFL Network reported that Cooper struggled to ramp up to game readiness. In turn, the 31-year-old is walking away from the league after 10 seasons.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nCooper was a member of the then-Oakland Raiders when they drafted him fourth overall out of Alabama in 2015. He tallied 225 catches for 3,183 yards and 19 touchdowns over 52 games with the franchise, earning three of his five Pro Bowl selections.\n\nThe Raiders traded him to the Cowboys midway through the 2018 campaign, as the team was tearing down the roster.\n\nCooper wasn't the only star leaving, as Khalil Mack was traded to the Chicago Bears before the NFL deadline as well.\n\nCooper quickly cemented himself as a reliable option for quarterback Dak Prescott, hauling in 292 passes for 3,893 yards and 27 touchdowns over 56 games. The Cowboys signed Cooper to a five-year, $100 million extension in March 2020, rewarding him for his efforts while wearing \"The Star.\"\n\nBut he was a salary-cap casualty in 2022 when the Cowboys dealt him to the Cleveland Browns.\n\nHe spent parts of three seasons in Cleveland, racking up 2,660 yards on 174 catches with 16 touchdowns over 38 games. Cooper began the 2024 season in Cleveland but was traded again\u2014this time to the Bills.\n\nIn Buffalo, Cooper caught a touchdown from Josh Allen, and many believed the 2024 NFL MVP had found a solid pass-catching option. However, Cooper's role never flourished, as he caught just one more touchdown during the regular season.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFor his career, Cooper finished with 711 receptions, 10,033 receiving yards and 64 total touchdowns.\n\nFollow Fox News Digital\u2019s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.",

      "text": "The Cleveland Browns were founded in 1944 and began their first season as a professional football team in 1946. Their inaugural NFL game was on September 6, 1946, where they defeated the former Miami Seahawks 44-0 at Municipal Stadium, the Browns' home field until 1995 before the team relocated to Baltimore. The Browns concluded their first NFL season with a 13-2 record.\nOhio businessman Arthur B. McBride acquired the Cleveland Browns and appointed Paul Brown as head coach. During his tenure from 1946 to 1962, Brown achieved a 167-53-8 record with the franchise. He was fired in 1963 and later founded the Cincinnati Bengals.\nThe Cleveland Browns had a remarkable first decade in NFL history, winning four AAFC titles and three championships in 1950, 1954, and 1955. The team has not won a title since securing the NFL Championship in 1964.\nNotable athletes in Browns history include Hall of Fame inductees: quarterback Clay Matthews Jr., wide receiver Paul Warfield, quarterback Otto Graham, defensive end Dante Lavelli, fullback Jim Brown, and offensive tackle Joe Thomas.\nIn 2017, the Browns selected defensive end Myles Garrett as the first overall NFL Draft pick. Garrett, often regarded as a dominant athlete in the league, signed a four-year extension worth $40 million per year, with $123.5 million guaranteed, in early 2025.\nModern-day Browns stars include cornerback Denzel Ward, who signed a five-year extension with the team in 2022. Former Browns running back Nick Chubb, a beloved powerhouse, signed a one-year deal with the Houston Texans in June 2025. Former wide receiver Jarvis Landry, released by the franchise in 2021, was a key player from 2018 to 2022."
