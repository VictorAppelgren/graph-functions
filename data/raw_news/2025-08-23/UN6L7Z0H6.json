  "title": "Conservative activist slams Cracker Barrel as company left reeling after logo redesign",
  "description": "Conservative activist Robby Starbuck released a scathing critique of Cracker Barrel as the company faces backlash after changing its iconic logo.",
  "content": "Conservative activist Robby Starbuck is the latest influencer to weigh in on the Cracker Barrel logo controversy. He described the company\u2019s logo makeover as going from \"old American nostalgia\" to something \"cold, dead, lifeless and modern.\" In his 15-minute video, Starbuck does a brutal takedown of the company\u2019s history, explaining how over the years it has embraced \"wokeness.\"\n\nStarbuck told his followers that while the Cracker Barrel brand is often associated with American tradition, the company is \"infested with left-wing activists who are more interested in safe spaces, pronouns, and virtue signaling than they are in their customers.\"\n\nIn his video, Starbuck highlights Cracker Barrel\u2019s support for LGBTQ+ organizations and events, such as Nashville Pride, River City Pride and the Human Rights Campaign (HRC).\n\nHe also noted that the company displayed rocking chairs with rainbow colors and LGBTQ+ insignia. The company even went so far as to place one in its Tennessee corporate office. Rocking chairs are practically synonymous with Cracker Barrel. Rocking chairs are practically synonymous with Cracker Barrel, with the restaurant\u2019s long porches lined with them at locations nationwide.\n\n\"The fact that it's located there is important to this story because what's happened here is a microcosm of the parasitic operating procedure of left-wing activists,\" Starbuck said. \"They don't just wanna force their soulless, godless, hedonistic vision of the future onto blue hellscapes that their party controls.\n\n\"No, it's much more important to them that they shove it down into your towns, into your kids' schools, and into your way of life. So, sticking a pro-trans rocking chair into their headquarters in a predominantly conservative town is exactly the type of thing they revel in doing.\"\n\nStarbuck then pointed to the company\u2019s involvement with HRC and participation in the Out and Equal Workplace Summit. For the Out and Equal conference, Cracker Barrel made rocking chairs in every color of the rainbow, representing the LGBTQ+ flag. Out and Equal even gave Cracker Barrel an award for having 2018\u2019s top LGBTQ+ Employee Resource Group (ERG).\n\nCRACKER BARREL DISMISSES CRITICS AS 'VOCAL MINORITY' WHILE RIVAL RESTAURANT ADDS TO BACKLASH\n\nThe restaurant chain previously participated in HRC\u2019s Corporate Equality Index, which measures \"corporate policies, practices, and benefits pertinent to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer employees,\" according to the organization\u2019s website. A company\u2019s score on the index is determined by how inclusive HRC judged it to be toward LGBTQ+ employees.\n\nCracker Barrel told Fox News Digital on Friday that it \"has not participated in the Human Rights Campaign Index or had any affiliation with HRC in several years.\"\n\nTwo Cracker Barrel employees are called out by name in Starbuck\u2019s video, Steve Smotherman and Rachel CampBell.\n\nSmotherman was the head of management training and development at Cracker Barrel for 15 years, Starbuck asserted, showing a screenshot that appeared to be from LinkedIn. Smotherman, who eventually left Cracker Barrel for Out and Equal, serves on HRC's Business Advisory Council in Washington, D.C.\n\nStarbuck describes Smotherman as \"the archetype activist employee that fueled the rise of DEI in corporate America.\" He also slammed CampBell, a manager of training and development at Cracker Barrel, for publicly expressing excitement over the company\u2019s rainbow pride rocking chairs.\n\n\"And it\u2019s important to note all of this because these types of employees play a critical role in turning companies away from the values of their customers and moving the companies toward wokeness,\" Starbuck said.\n\nCRACKER BARREL EXECUTIVE INSISTS RESTAURANT REMODELS ARE 'WHAT THE GUESTS ASKED FOR'\n\nGilbert D\u00e1vila, a member of Cracker Barrel\u2019s board of directors, was also referenced in Starbuck\u2019s video. D\u00e1vila, who joined Cracker Barrel\u2019s board in 2020, has worked at several major companies, including Disney, Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble. He\u2019s also the co-CEO of DMI Consulting, which looks to \"infuse cultural relevance and creativity into every solution.\" Starbuck asserted that D\u00e1vila, and others like him, are responsible for the \"woke advertising push\" seen over the last few years.\n\nIn the end, Starbuck emphasizes that the controversy around Cracker Barrel\u2019s logo change is about more than the removal of a man in his chair leaning on a barrel.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"It's very, very important to understand that the Cracker Barrel story is not about a logo. It's not at all about a logo, it is about a country, it is our heritage, and it is a culture. It's about a power structure built to tell us that we are somehow backwards, embarrassing or bigoted,\" Starbuck said.\n\n\"A conservative can't give their money to Cracker Barrel. A Christian cannot give their money to Cracker Barrel, and so we won't,\" he added.\n\nAs Starbuck sees it, the Cracker Barrel debacle is a win-win for conservatives, saying that the company will either have to double down and lose customers or revert back to its 1977 logo to retain its customer base.\n\nFox News Digital\u2019s Brian Flood and Nikolas Lanum contributed to this report.\n\nCracker Barrel did not respond Fox News Digital's request for comment in time for publication.",

      "text": "Cracker Barrel Old Country Store customers have been vocal on social media about their disdain for the recent transformation of the Tennessee-based restaurant chain.\nThose voices grew even louder after Cracker Barrel unveiled its new logo this week.\nThe new logo does away with the illustration of an old man leaning against a barrel while seated in a chair. Instead, the text-only logo uses a new typeface against the familiar gold background.\nCRACKER BARREL UNVEILS NEW SIMPLIFIED LOGO: 'OUR STORY HASN'T CHANGED'\nCracker Barrel also rolled out a new menu that includes breakfast, lunch and dinner options and \"refreshed restaurant remodels\" as part of its \"All the More\" campaign, according to a news release.\nAlthough Sarah Moore, Cracker Barrel's chief marketing officer, touted the changes as \"bringing fresh energy, thoughtful craftsmanship and heartfelt hospitality to our guests,\" many people on social media had a far different perspective.\nBenny Johnson, a YouTube content creator and conservative influencer based in Florida, wrote on X that the new logo is \"absolutely horrible.\"\n\"When will they learn?\" he added.\nThe responses were resoundingly negative.\nCRACKER BARREL CUSTOMERS 'HATE' RESTAURANT CHAIN'S NEW LOOK IN VIRAL SOCIAL MEDIA VIDEOS\n\"Not a cracker or a barrel in sight,\" one person wrote.\n\"It's worse than horrible.

It's not country cooking anymore,\" one person commented.\n\"The food has been substandard for a while,\" another said.\nMoore told Fox News Digital in May that Cracker Barrel has been \"listening to what the guests ask for \u2013 and examples of what the guests asked for are things like spaces that feel brighter, that feel less cluttered, more booth seating, more seating options, so our guests are more comfortable while they're dining with us.\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\nShe said fan favorites like the rocking chairs, peg games and antiquities on the wall aren't going anywhere.\n\"The things you love about us will stay,\" she said.\nA Cracker Barrel spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement that the company is \"very pleased with the trajectory of our remodeled stores.\"\nFor more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle\n\"Feedback from both guests and team members has been overwhelmingly positive and enthusiastic about the refreshed dining and shopping experience,\" the statement said.\n\"All of the elements of our remodels were informed by direct input from our guests and team members alike.

      "text": "The term \"woke\" is often used to refer to progressive, politically correct stances on race, gender ideology, and other hot-button topics. The word first appeared in print in a 1962 New York Times essay by author William Melvin Kelley. Merriam-Webster added the word to its dictionary in 2017, defining it as \"aware of and actively attentive to important facts and issues (especially issues of racial and social justice).\"\n\"The word woke became entwined with the Black Lives Matter movement; instead of just being a word that signaled awareness of injustice or racial tension, it became a word of action. Activists were woke and called on others to stay woke,\" according to Merriam-Webster.\nWoke culture has spread across various fields, including education, the corporate world, politics, and social media. The term's meaning evolved further with the rise of \"cancel culture.\" As both terms gained popularity, they became intertwined in public consciousness."

      "text": "Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, the chain of southern-style restaurants with a gift shop that lines highways across America, has gotten a makeover. Their logo has lost the \"Old Country Store\" tagline, as well as the iconic man in a chair resting his arm on a barrel in favor of the words Cracker Barrel in text only. Inside, per patron videos of remodeled locations, gone is the dark nostalgic feel replaced with a sterile renovation. The knick-knacks have gone from quirky kitsch from yesteryear to something you might see in a suburban craft store.\nWhile the company\u2019s CEO has said that initial reaction to these changes was positive, the verdict across social media was very much the opposite. The new look removes the old-school charm and character that was central to the brand\u2019s identity for decades.\nCracker Barrel is just the latest in a string of companies, including Jaguar more recently and even Coca-Cola in the mid-\u201980s with their New Coke rollout, to violate the critical principle of making sure that you do not alienate your loyal customer base.\nDAVID MARCUS: CRACKER BARREL ABANDONS CUSTOMERS, TRADING AUTHENTICITY FOR CORPORATE SLOP\nI wear many hats in business and have more than 20 years of experience as an advocate for loyal customers and clients in business, working in an outsourced CCO (Chief Customer Officer) function and sharing my proprietary customer loyalty models via speeches and consulting with both the biggest companies in the world and a variety of small and mid-sized businesses. And I firmly believe that one of a company\u2019s most important assets isn\u2019t listed on its balance sheet: the company\u2019s loyal customers.\nLoyal customers are easier to sell more to, both in frequency of purchases and upsells, because they already love your business and have often given you permission to communicate with them and build a relationship. They are also excellent advocates for generating new business via their own advertising efforts \u2014 word of mouth, posts on social media and more.\nWhile it is a challenge for companies to continually grow, and publicly traded companies are under even more pressure to do so, mathematically, growth becomes harder if you are losing customers from your key customer base.\nCRACKER BARREL'S NEW TEXT-ONLY LOGO IS 'HOW YOU DESTROY A BRAND,' CRITICS CLAIM\nIf you make your customers believe you do not care about them and their relationship with your brand and company, it is going to be very difficult for you to be successful in your business. This is the stark reality many businesses who have sought out new customers have faced lately. It\u2019s fine to reach new customers, but you must do it carefully and in a way that doesn\u2019t simultaneously burn goodwill with your existing customers.\nNew customers should never be treated better or given more weight than existing, loyal customers.\nIn my own social media post resharing a video of a Cracker Barrel dining room remodel, I received thousands of interactions. Among the majority comments from long-time customers expressing their displeasure at the changes, one other comment stood out. The poster said, \"I don\u2019t eat there but it looks nice to me.\"\nAnd that is the crux of the issue. The poster is not a customer, and based on the comment, is not likely to become a customer. So, seeking her approval is not a revenue-enhancing win for the company. Maybe it gets some ROE (return on ego) points for the marketing team, but it doesn\u2019t get ROI (return on investment) for shareholders.\nCRACKER BARREL UNVEILS NEW SIMPLIFIED LOGO: 'OUR STORY HASN\u2019T CHANGED'\nFor Cracker Barrel, losing character in a time when corporatization is making everything around us bland and soulless feels like something enjoyable from the past is being killed off. And for a brand which has been based on nostalgia \u2014 from their d\u00e9cor to their nostalgic candy and wares in their adjacent store \u2014 it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nI am a long-time Cracker Barrel patron. I stop in whenever I am on the road. And as a long-time customer, as well as business advisor and executive, I can tell you that Cracker Barrel\u2019s logo was not their issue.\nMy last stop in was in June on a road trip. I noted that I hadn\u2019t been there in a while prior, because I hadn\u2019t been on the road much. And in a moment where convenience is a part of the equation and DoorDash has taken hold of younger generations, it is harder to get touchpoints with a brand, even if you want them. This is a much bigger strategic endeavor that Cracker Barrel needs to think through.\nCRACKER BARREL EXECUTIVE INSISTS RESTAURANT REMODELS ARE 'WHAT THE GUESTS ASKED FOR'\nMy other issue was the menu. They had taken off my favorite item and their hashbrown casserole tasted off \u2014 the food overall wasn\u2019t as fresh as I had experienced in the past. In my social media post, there were several comments about a decline in food quality over recent years. Making the menu and food quality rock-solid is critical for a restaurant, particularly when consumers are trying to stretch their dollars.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nCracker Barrel isn\u2019t the first and certainly won\u2019t be the last company to fall into the trap of thinking that all change is good. Companies should be bringing their customer voices to the table, which can be accomplished with a CCO whose job it is to know the customers well and advocate for them within the company or other loyalty specialist advising.\nLoyalty is hard to build and easy to lose. Companies always want to attract new customers, but that isn\u2019t effective if relationships with existing customers aren\u2019t nurtured at the same time."

  "argos_summary": "Cracker Barrel\u2019s recent rebrand, which replaced its iconic man\u2011in\u2011a\u2011chair logo with a text\u2011only design, has sparked widespread backlash from loyal customers and conservative critics who accuse the chain of abandoning its nostalgic heritage for a \u2018woke\u2019 image.  The company defends the changes as a response to guest feedback and a refreshed dining experience, while activists like Robby Starbuck decry the brand\u2019s support for LGBTQ+ initiatives and corporate diversity programs as a betrayal of traditional values.  Social media users and rival restaurants have amplified the criticism, calling the new look generic and a loss of character, whereas Cracker Barrel maintains that its core values remain unchanged.  The controversy highlights tensions between corporate modernization efforts and a customer base that values heritage and cultural identity.",
