  "title": "Samsung's new DeX drops desktop UI on tablets, and not everyone will be happy",
  "description": "One UI 8 removes the desktop UI from Samsung DeX unless you're connected to an external display, making keyboard and mouse navigation worse.",
  "content": "Android 16 introduced Google\u2019s take on a Desktop Mode for Android, and the new version of Samsung DeX is based on it. While some of the changes are welcome, there are some downsides to the latest version of DeX. The Galaxy Tab S11 series gives us our first look at the new DeX on a tablet, and some of these updates might not sit well with everyone.\n\nNo more desktop UI on tablet screens\n\nIn One UI 8, DeX will no longer display the desktop-style UI on the tablet itself \u2014 you\u2019ll only get it on connected displays. Instead, DeX will work as seen in the screenshot above, where you\u2019ll get the standard Android home screen, and apps will launch in a pop-up window when opened. You\u2019ll also have access to the standard Android taskbar, as you do when not using DeX, but the notification and quick settings shortcuts at the bottom of the screen are gone, as are the back, home, and recent app keys.\n\nIf that sounds familiar, it\u2019s because this version of DeX already exists in One UI 7, only it\u2019s optional rather than mandatory. Alas, One UI 8 removes the option to switch back to classic DeX.\n\nAlso gone is the quick settings toggle that lets you enter DeX, now replaced with a shortcut to connect DeX to a TV or PC wirelessly. Thankfully, the new way to enter DeX is more convenient than before. Instead of having to turn DeX on and off to switch between it and regular Android, it can now live side-by-side, and you can switch back and forth without any of your apps closing or restarting.\n\nTo access DeX in One UI 8 on the Galaxy Tab S11, open the overview screen, swipe to the right to find a desktop, and tap it. You\u2019ll be taken back to your homescreen, now with Android\u2019s taskbar on display. Any app you open will launch in a pop-up window, where it can be minimised, maximised, or snapped to either half of the screen.\n\nThe new way of getting in and out of Samsung DeX is great and is more touch-friendly, but removing the more desktop-inspired taskbar is a step backward.\n\nSure, you still have a taskbar with your app drawer, but now you have to use the regular notification and quick settings shades at the top of the screen, which aren\u2019t the easiest to navigate with a keyboard or mouse. Likewise, you\u2019ll have to rely on keyboard shortcuts or use the mouse to click and drag where you\u2019d usually touch the screen to go back, home, or into the recent apps screen.\n\nSamsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra is the biggest and best Galaxy Tab to date. The 14.6-inch display rocks 120Hz at 2,960x1,848 pixels of resolution. A huge 11,600mAh battery should keep you going all day, and quad-speakers promise a crisp entertainment experience.\n\nSo, while this new implementation of DeX certainly has its upsides, the lack of mouse-friendly controls when not connected to an external display is disappointing. How do you feel about the changes to DeX? Let us know below.",

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nAndroid 16's Desktop Mode transforms your Pixel phone into a PC, and here's how you can try it now\nJune 10, 2025\n- Google is developing a DeX-like desktop mode for Android phones, and you can try it out now on supported Pixel devices with Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2.\n- This feature projects a desktop-like environment with a taskbar and freeform windows to an external display, while the phone screen remains usable.\n- The desktop mode experience requires a Pixel 8 or newer, the latest Android 16 QPR1 beta, and an external display.\nOne of the most exciting pieces of Android news from last month\u2019s Google I/O developer conference was Google confirming it\u2019s working on a desktop mode feature for Android phones. At the event, the company revealed that the desktop windowing experience it built for tablets will extend to external displays, meaning you\u2019ll get a desktop-like environment when you connect your phone to an external monitor. Better yet, Google also announced you\u2019ll be able to try this new desktop feature on your Pixel device in a future Android 16 quarterly release beta. The wait is now over: Android 16\u2019s new Desktop Mode is available to try out in the latest Android beta!\nHow to enable Android 16\u2019s Desktop Mode on your Pixel phone\nTo get started, you\u2019ll need a Pixel phone that supports display output over USB-C \u2014 this means the Pixel 8 and later models, including A-series devices. The Pixel 7 and earlier, unfortunately, lack hardware support for DisplayPort Alternate Mode, the feature that allows some of the USB-C pins to carry a DisplayPort signal. Google enabled this feature starting with its Tensor G3 generation of Pixel devices, which means the Pixel Tablet and the first-generation Pixel Fold also lack display output support.\nThe next thing you\u2019ll need to do is install the latest Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2 update. Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2 adds the new Desktop Mode experience feature that enables a desktop session to be started on an external display. The feature isn\u2019t enabled by default, however. To enable the new Desktop Mode experience feature, simply navigate to Settings > System > Developer options and toggle \u2018Enable desktop experience features\u2019.\nYou\u2019ll be asked to reboot your phone, and after doing so, you should see the same desktop mode experience we demoed last month when you connect your Pixel phone to an external display. Google confirmed at I/O that this desktop experience is built on the foundation of Samsung DeX, which explains why there are many similarities.\nWhat is Android 16\u2019s Desktop Mode currently like?\nMuch like DeX, Android\u2019s new desktop mode features a taskbar at the bottom of the external display. This taskbar displays the app drawer, your pinned apps, recently opened apps, and navigation buttons. The status bar appears at the top; pulling it down reveals the notification and Quick Settings panels side-by-side. More importantly, apps launch in freeform windows that you can freely move or resize. Similar to Microsoft Windows, apps can also be snapped to the side, making it easier to drag and drop content between them.\nGoogle confirmed at I/O that while desktop mode is in use, your phone or tablet\u2019s display remains fully usable. This is because Android projects a virtual display to the external monitor, allowing your phone or tablet\u2019s main screen to operate independently. This means you can use your phone or tablet for other tasks while different apps are running on the external display.\nBetter yet, you can use the same mouse to control both your phone or tablet and the external display, as Android 16 also improves external display management to enable seamless mouse cursor movement between them. Since tablets support desktop windowing on their main displays, Android also allows app windows and content to seamlessly move between the tablet\u2019s display and the external display.\nSince phones and tablets have wildly different screens than most external displays, Android allows you to independently manage the display and text size for your phone or tablet versus the external display. Simply navigate to Settings > Connected devices > External display to control these settings.\nWhat else is new for desktop windowing in Android 16?\nBeyond extending desktop windowing to external displays, Android 16 also introduces several new features for desktop windowing. This includes support for multiple desktops, allowing you to create different workspaces for productivity, entertainment, and more. New keyboard shortcuts and trackpad gestures allow you to easily switch between these desktops. Android can even maintain window sizes, positions, and states across different desktops, so you can set up your preferred workspaces once and Android will restore them the next time you enter desktop mode.\nAndroid 16 also improves how legacy apps behave on external displays. The operating system allows you to freely resize apps with locked orientation. This means that, even if an app is locked to portrait mode, it can be elongated when run in a desktop windowing environment. However, if the app tells the system that it\u2019s nonresizable, then Android will maintain the app\u2019s aspect ratio as it scales the UI. Lastly, if an app opens a camera preview when in desktop windowing, the viewfinder\u2019s aspect ratio is maintained while the rest of the app is freely resized.\nThe introduction of a proper desktop mode for Android phones is an exciting development. It\u2019s admittedly a bit underwhelming in its current state, especially when compared to Samsung DeX, let alone full-fledged desktop operating systems. Keep in mind, though, that Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2 only features an early iteration of Google\u2019s new desktop mode. In this beta, Google requires manually flipping a developer toggle to enable it \u2014 a clear indicator that it isn\u2019t ready for prime time. I\u2019m confident it will improve, though, as Google has a long-term vision of transforming Android into a desktop-class operating system. Rolling out this desktop mode for Android phones is key to that vision, providing developers with another strong incentive to optimize apps for large-screen compatibility.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nSamsung announces incredibly thin Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra and a smaller Tab S11\n1 hour ago\n- Samsung has unveiled the Galaxy Tab S11 and the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra.\n- The Galaxy Tab S11 replaces the Plus model in a more compact form but with similar power to the Ultra.\n- The Ultra has a massive 14.6-inch display and is both thinner and lighter than last year\u2019s model.\nSamsung is refreshing its flagship Android tablet lineup today with the introduction of the new Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra. These tablets come with incremental changes over the previous Galaxy Tab S10 series, and we\u2019ll walk you through all of those.\nLet\u2019s start with the immediately apparent change: the naming. With this launch, Samsung is eliminating the Plus variant \u2014 for now, at least \u2014 and reviving the standard Galaxy Tab S11, which features a smaller 10.9-inch AMOLED screen with a 2560 x 1600 resolution. A similar lineup rejig is expected of the Galaxy S26 series, where Samsung is likely to eliminate the Galaxy S26 Plus and rename the base Galaxy S26 to S26 Pro.\nThe enormous Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra arrives alongside the smaller Galaxy Tab S11. The Ultra still features the massive 14.6-inch AMOLED, but Samsung is scaling back to a single front-facing camera, resulting in a smaller notch. This allows it to claim a few micrometers of screen real estate, along with the opportunity to label it the biggest screen on a Galaxy Tab ever. Despite the reclaimed space, the screen\u2019s resolution remains unchanged at 2960 x 1848 pixels.\nThe displays on both screens feature 120Hz refresh rates with a peak brightness of 1,600 nits. The Ultra also receives an anti-reflective coating, as it did last year, while the base variant comes with standard reflective glass, but you can preserve it with an official anti-reflective screen protector.\nDon\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority?\n- Set us as a preferred source in Google Search to support us and make sure you never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more.\nBesides those changes, the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra maintains the same length and width, but is now slimmer, measuring 0.20 inches (~5.1mm). It is also slightly lighter, now weighing 692 grams, down from 718 grams last year. The regular Tab S11 isn\u2019t far behind in terms of sleekness and measures only 2.2 inches (5.6mm) in thickness, which is the same as the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus. It\u2019s also significantly lighter, weighing just 469 grams. Despite their slender bodies, both tablets also get an IP68 rating.\nMinor changes to battery and cameras\nDespite its slimmer figure, the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra comes with a slightly larger battery, now boasting a 11,600mAh capacity. Meanwhile, the Tab S11 gets a smaller 8,400mAh battery. Both tablets can fast charge at up to 45W, which is the same speed as before.\nThe 13MP primary and an 8MP ultrawide camera on the back of the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra remain unchanged, as Samsung switches to a single 12MP ultrawide camera on the front \u2014 rather than two last year. The Galaxy Tab S11, on the other hand, gets a single 13MP camera on the back and a 12MP ultrawide on the front.\nInternally, both the Galaxy Tab S11 and the Tab S11 Ultra are stocked with MediaTek Dimensity 9400+, a marginally overclocked version of the Dimensity 9400. The base chipset itself has been upgraded to a 3nm node, resulting in a 24% increase in CPU performance and a 27% improvement in GPU performance. The NPU performance is also claimed to have increased by 33%.\nSimilar configurations, better software\nMeanwhile, the RAM and storage options for the Tab S11 Ultra remain the same. The 256GB and 512GB storage variants are paired with 12GB of RAM, while the 1TB variant comes with 16GB of RAM.\nThe variants for the Galaxy Tab S11 have been limited to 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB, all of which feature 12GB RAM. However, both tablets support storage expansion with microSD cards of up to 2TB.\nIn terms of software, we\u2019re seeing One UI 8, based on Android 16, natively, with familiar Galaxy AI features that assist with writing, drawing, and summarizing audio. A noticeable change is the introduction of a new floating Galaxy AI overlay, which can be used in conjunction with split-screen setups.\nMeanwhile, Samsung DeX is receiving a significant upgrade and will now support four separate workspaces, along with support for multi-screen setups. With this upgrade, you will be able to drag and drop windows from one screen onto another, just like on a desktop. However, Samsung is removing the option to enable a DeX view without connecting to an external monitor.\nNew accessories and connectivity options\nBesides these changes on the tablets, the accessories have also been revamped. The S Pen for the Galaxy Tab S11 series now features a distinct hexagonal shape, replacing the previously round one. While the S Pen retains a button, Samsung is removing Bluetooth, just like it did with the S Pen on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. That means it won\u2019t support air gestures or wireless camera control, though you can still use it as a remote control in the Galaxy Tab\u2019s proximity.\nSamsung is also claiming to have improved the keyboard folio with a slimmer profile that matches the Ultra. Additionally, it is working on a more capable \u201cPro\u201d keyboard that will be announced in early 2026.\nNeither the Galaxy Tab S11 nor the Tab S11 Ultra offers cellular connectivity anymore. However, the Ultra features more advanced Wi-Fi 7, rather than Wi-Fi 6E, which may seem unreasonable as both share the same internals.\nIf you want a Galaxy Tab with cellular connectivity, you can opt for the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus, which hasn\u2019t been discontinued. Similarly, Samsung will continue to sell the Galaxy Tab S10 FE and Tab S10 FE Plus until they are replaced, hopefully next year.\nPricing and availability\nIn terms of pricing, the Galaxy Tab S11 starts at $799.99 for the 128GB storage option, and the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra will start at $1,199.99.\nBoth the Galaxy Tab S11 and the Tab S11 Ultra will be available starting today, alongside the Galaxy S25 FE, which is also being announced today.\nThank you for being part of our community.

Learn more.\nSamsung DeX finally gets multi-monitor support on the Galaxy Tab S11\n55 minutes ago\n- Samsung is rolling out multi-monitor support in Samsung DeX, starting with the Galaxy Tab S11 and One UI 8.\n- Extended Mode allows dragging apps and files between your monitor and tablet display.\n- Launching with the Tab S11, this will reach older Samsung tablets with the One UI 8 update.\nSamsung DeX is one of the best desktop modes on mobile and has been a useful tool since it was introduced on the Galaxy S8. Samsung overhauled DeX in One UI 8, basing it on Android 16\u2019s new Desktop Mode, but there are more new features to come. The Galaxy Tab S11 gives DeX users a long-requested multi-monitor feature.\nAt last, multi-monitors\nA second monitor is one of the easiest ways to boost productivity, and it\u2019s something that\u2019s been sorely missing from DeX until now. Starting with One UI 8 on the Galaxy Tab S11 series, you\u2019ll be able to use the tablet screen as a secondary display when you\u2019ve plugged it into your monitor. Until now, the DeX experience on a connected display has been in a separate sandbox from the tablet display, which shows your normal home screen or a virtual trackpad.\nDon\u2019t want to miss the best from Android Authority?\n- Set us as a preferred source in Google Search to support us and make sure you never miss our latest exclusive reports, expert analysis, and much more.\nOnce you\u2019ve connected the Tab S11 to your monitor, you\u2019ll be able to move app windows across the two displays, drag and drop files, and everything else you\u2019d want from a desktop platform. The experience isn\u2019t quite what we\u2019d expect, though, as the tablet home screen will remain in place and will not mirror DeX\u2019s UI with the taskbar at the bottom of the display. That\u2019s unfortunate, but a minor caveat to what should be a major upgrade to using Samsung DeX.\nUsing your tablet\u2019s screen as a second monitor is a part of the Desktop Mode Google added to Android 16, as seen in Google\u2019s Demo video. This will be our first time seeing it in person, though, as the Pixel tablet lacks display output. So, all Android tablets that support display output and run Android 16 should be able to be used this way.\nAre you looking forward to DeX Extended Mode?\nAre you looking forward to using Samsung DeX on the Tab S11?

Learn more.\n5 Samsung DeX features I'll miss if they don't return in One UI 8\nJuly 28, 2025\nI\u2019ll admit it: I\u2019ve never been the biggest Samsung DeX user. Not because I don\u2019t like it \u2014 I think it\u2019s the gold standard for casting your phone to an external display \u2014 but because I spend far too much time with non-Samsung phones in my pocket. The funny thing is that every time I leave the Galaxy ecosystem behind, that\u2019s precisely when I need DeX most.\nAnd now that it\u2019s about to undergo significant changes as part of One UI 8, I\u2019m a little worried. I don\u2019t want to lose certain DeX features, even if it ultimately leads to a better experience in Android\u2019s Desktop mode. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m not looking forward to losing:\nLock DeX and Exit DeX saved my clumsiness\nLike I said, I\u2019m not the biggest DeX user \u2014 it just comes with the territory of switching phones dozens of times per year. Unfortunately, that often means I forget the rules of how it\u2019s supposed to work, accidentally quitting out of DeX when I only meant to rearrange a window or two to make my life a little bit easier. Thankfully, Samsung had a solution: The ability to lock myself into DeX or only exit via a button in the app drawer.\nRight now, my most-used feature in DeX is a handy little button called Lock DeX. Honestly, it\u2019s as simple as it sounds, making it so that I can\u2019t exit DeX unless I use biometrics to unlock my Galaxy S25, but it\u2019s become essential for my needs. It\u2019s saved my bacon (or at least a few minutes\u2019 worth of work) more times than I can count, keeping me from having to reopen windows and figure out layouts based on my own mix-up.\nIf I were Google, I\u2019d take notice. Android 16\u2019s Desktop mode needs a way to keep clumsy users like me in mind, and I think copying Lock DeX is the easiest way to do it. Either that, or copy Exit DeX and make sure that I physically press a button before my phone stops casting.\nMultiStar\u2019s I\u2764\ufe0f Samsung DeX made Good Lock worth it\nAlthough I don\u2019t usually like to download or use Good Lock, I\u2019m willing to make an exception when it comes to DeX. See, my problems typically center around the fact that Good Lock is too essential for basics like fleshing out the Galaxy Z Flip\u2019s Flex Window, but it\u2019s far more useful when it comes to DeX. It opens up the number of apps I can run at any one time and opening a previous app quickly, and now it seems like Samsung will take that away.\nLuckily, the I\u2764\ufe0fSamsung DeX plugin isn\u2019t totally going away \u2014 it\u2019ll stick around for the \u201cHigh resolutions for external display\u201d option, which lets you make the most of your Galaxy device\u2019s crisp resolution, but not much else. I would have much rather it kept the \u201cRun many apps at same time\u201d feature, which makes DeX a viable way for me to work across Chrome, Slack, Spotify, Lightroom, and a few others when I need it to stand in for my laptop in a pinch, but my best guess right now is that it\u2019ll have to come back as part of a future update.\nAt the very least, I can only hope that Android 16\u2019s Desktop mode eventually gains Chrome OS\u2019s Continue where you left off feature, allowing me to reopen the apps I used the last time I quit out of DeX.\nPlease don\u2019t force me into a permanent taskbar\nWhile my first two picks have been things I don\u2019t want Samsung to take away from me, the next thing I need out of DeX in One UI 8 is to keep my current taskbar flexibility. Right now, the taskbar is just about perfect \u2014 it appears when I need it to, but disappears when I\u2019m watching a full-screen video or otherwise making the most of my much larger display. In the earliest version of One UI 8, though, it looks like that\u2019s about to change.\nAs my colleague Mishaal Rahman figured out, the taskbar and app header are about to become permanent. That means even if you\u2019re watching a full-screen YouTube video, catching up on our brand-new C Scott Brown channel (give my fellow Pixel-lover a follow), you\u2019ll always see your taskbar full of apps along the bottom edge. It\u2019s a little bit less noticeable if you\u2019ve set your app icons to match your wallpaper, but still not my favorite look when I\u2019d much rather be focused on a video telling me all about the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Fold 7.\nI need to be able to pin apps to my desktop\nBy now, I hope you\u2019ve realized that I\u2019m no DeX pro. I accidentally exit out of it, I keep trying to modify it, and I sometimes have issues with how it handles full-screen content. Worse, I also find that I lose apps in DeX if I\u2019m trying to do too many things at once. So, you can imagine my relief when I realized that Samsung lets me pin apps to the top of my stack just to ensure they aren\u2019t lost in the shuffle.\nAnd, just like everything else on this list, that might be changing. Right now, the pin feature is missing from One UI 8, meaning every app is created equal and could easily get lost somewhere in the middle of my busy to-do list. For some people, that might be fine \u2014 especially if they only do one or two things in DeX at a time \u2014 but not me. I want to be able to bounce between several tasks, but I know that I need to have Slack visible at all times, which I can only really do with the pin feature.\nIf I right-click, I want it to do, well, something\nLast but not least, I grew up as a Windows kid. I remember using everything from Windows Vista as a little kid to Windows 8 in high school and Windows 10 in college. Through every single version, I had one feature I could always count on: The right click. It\u2019s the fastest way to organize my desktop, access quick settings, and banish things to the recycling bin without having to drag and drop.\nSo, when I found that Samsung\u2019s classic DeX experience supported the same gesture, I was hooked. I mean, copying a feature I\u2019ve been using ever since I learned my way around a computer is one of the easiest ways to ensure I keep using your software, so someone at Samsung must have listened closely.\nI'm a Windows kid, I need my right-click.\nIn its current DeX implementation, right-clicking on the taskbar opens taskbar settings, while a click on the desktop lets you sort your apps, clean up the desktop, or adjust your screen zoom. I only use the first two features, mostly out of my deep need to stay organized, but I can still appreciate that control over zoom is there. I\u2019m sure one day I\u2019ll need that one, too, but it won\u2019t be as easy if One UI 8 has its way.\nIt seems like most of Samsung\u2019s right-click controls are on their way out, and I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019ll be replaced by something like a long-press gesture or if Android 16\u2019s Desktop mode will just be slightly annoying about a feature that could be so simple.\nThen again, we\u2019ve also seen that Samsung is determined to preserve a lot of its DeX features, including its S Pen integration, wallpaper settings, and wireless display options, so maybe there\u2019s still time for it to rescue a few of my favorites before we get too far away from what made DeX great.\nThank you for being part of our community.

The new design shows a standard Android home screen on the tablet, with apps launching in pop\u2011up windows and the taskbar replaced by a minimal Android taskbar. Users lose quick\u2011access features such as the notification shade, back/home/recent buttons, and mouse\u2011friendly controls, which may hinder productivity on the tablet\u2019s own screen. The change is intended to streamline the experience, but many users feel it reduces usability when not connected to an external monitor.",
