  "title": "Thursday, September 4. Russia\u2019s War On Ukraine: News And Information From Ukraine",
  "description": "Dispatches from Ukraine. Day 1,289.",
  "content": "On September 3, Ukraine reported at least one person killed and five others wounded after an overnight air strike involving 526 projectiles. Ukraine\u2019s Air Force intercepted and jammed 430 drones along with 21 of 24 missiles. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced the attack as \u201cdemonstrative,\u201d describing it as designed to display Russian impunity. \u201cEvery Russian strike must be met with a real response,\u201d he posted on X. Ukrainian Commander-in-Chief Valerii Syrskyi declared that Ukraine would build a layered defense system necessary to protect its people from Russian drones.\n\nBetween September 1 and September 4, Russian strikes killed at least 21 civilians and wounded more than 70 others across Ukraine. Eastern Donetsk region, the hardest hit, suffered 14 civilians killed and 39 wounded. In the south, Kherson province recorded three fatalities and 19 wounded. Northeastern Kharkiv province posted three deaths and 10 wounded; in neighboring central Dnipropetrovsk region, one person was killed and at least three others were wounded.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said on September 3 that he is willing to meet Zelenskyy face-to-face in Moscow. Speaking at a press conference following the Victory Day parade in Beijing, Putin said that a visit by Zelenskyy to the Russian capital is possible, adding that he has \u201cnever excluded the possibility of meeting with him.\u201d\n\nUkraine, however, rejected the proposal outright. \u201cIf you want no meeting to happen \u2014 then invite me to Moscow,\u201d Zelenskyy said at a press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on September 4. Zelenskyy added that while Russia\u2019s talk of a meeting is \u201calready a good sign,\u201d Kyiv sees no real Russian intentions to end the war. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha also dismissed the idea of talks in Moscow. He pointed to \u201cserious proposals\u201d from seven alternative host countries and accused Putin of \u201cmaking knowingly unacceptable proposals.\u201d\n\nPutin arrived in China on August 31 for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, which included more than 20 countries. He then attended an immense military parade in Beijing, marking the 80th anniversary of victory in World War II. The parade took place at Tiananmen Square, where Chinese authorities brutally suppressed student-led, pro-democracy protests in 1989.\n\nFor both China and Russia, the visit had strategic implications. Putin gained additional legitimacy in the wake of his recent meeting in Alaska with U.S. President Donald Trump. Russia also secured China\u2019s approval for the long-awaited \u201cPower of Siberia 2\u201d pipeline, which will traverse Mongolia, with plans to supply 50 billion cubic meters of gas annually over 30 years. For China, the summit served as a vivid demonstration of its growing economic and military power.\n\nThe close ties between the two authoritarian leaders were further underscored by a circulated dialogue between Putin and Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, in which they discussed extending human longevity through bio-technologies, a possible indication of Putin\u2019s intent to retain power in the Kremlin as long as possible.\n\nFor weeks, Ukrainian drones have been targeting Russian oil refineries. Some of these strikes have yielded a measurable effect, knocking out as much as 20% of Russia's refining capacity. That loss represents some one million barrels a day, mostly gasoline and diesel. The result has been lines at gas stations across Russia, with reports of shortages from occupied Crimea to Vladivostok in Russia's Far East.\n\nMoreover, wholesale gas prices have skyrocketed 54% since January to a record high. To protect the domestic supply, the government has been forced to ban gasoline exports; in some regions, fuel rationing is already in place. The strain is also visible in Moscow\u2019s finances: Russia\u2019s budget deficit for the first seven months of 2025 hit $61.4 billion, the annual target.\n\nAt the forefront of Ukraine\u2019s campaign is \u201ckamikaze\u201d drone development. First presented in May, these models are already rolling off the lines at 100 drones per day. Each costs some $55,000 but can fly up to 1,000 miles into Russia with a warhead carrying approximately 130 to 265 pounds of explosives. These characteristics make the drone cheap enough to use on a large scale and advanced enough to slip through Russian defense systems.\n\nWhile Russia grapples with domestic fuel woes, its oil exports benefit foreign buyers. India\u2019s imports of Russian crude oil have saved its refiners at least $12.6 billion since April, 2022. Discounts were steep at that time, helping India take advantage of Russian barrels priced well below other suppliers. By the 2024-25 fiscal year, however, the savings had narrowed to $1.45 billion, as discounts shrank while shipping and insurance costs rose due to Western restrictions.\n\nIn addition to the direct savings, the real benefits for India might be even higher. Its purchases helped keep global crude prices in check, preventing a spike in the country\u2019s import bill. For a nation that relies on imports for roughly 88% of its oil, the indirect effect of stabilizing global markets likely outweighs the reduced discounts.\n\nBuying Russian oil boosted India\u2019s exports. India has emerged as a leading supplier of diesel to Ukraine this year, providing some 10% of total diesel deliveries. Just a year earlier, it accounted for barely 1% of the country\u2019s imports. Between January and August, Ukraine imported 451,000 tons of diesel from India, worth approximately $333 million.\n\nThe timing for the increase has been crucial. In 2025, India reopened Red Sea shipping routes previously blocked by Yemen\u2019s Houthis. This move has allowed Indian diesel to reach Ukraine more efficiently and compete with other sellers.\n\nThe surge, however, might not last long. Major Ukrainian fuel distributors such as WOG and OKKO have refused to import Indian diesel, citing concerns that much of it is made from Russian crude. \u201cWe clearly understand that diesel from India is produced from Russian oil, and this is unacceptable for us,\u201d WOG told Forbes Ukraine on September 3. European sanctions could further complicate matters: the EU\u2019s 18th package of sanctions, taking effect next January, bans imports of petroleum products made from Russian oil in third countries.",

      "text": "- Category\n- Latest news\nUkraine\u2019s FP-1 Suicide Drone, With 1,600-Km Range, Already Striking Deep Inside Russia\nUkraine\u2019s FP-1 suicide drone has already been widely used in strikes on military and infrastructure targets inside Russia, according to Ukrainian defense outlet Militarnyi on May 8, despite only being publicly unveiled a few days ago.\nWreckage from the FP-1 has been found across several Russian regions\u2014including Saratov, Moscow, Voronezh, Kaluga, and Tula\u2014just in the month of March alone, Russian outlets reported.\nThe drone is believed to have been used in strikes throughout Russia since at least early 2024.\nOne of the most notable attacks attributed to the FP-1 took place in August 2024, when Ukraine reportedly targeted the Russian Marinovka airbase. The strike destroyed at least one Su-34 fighter bomber and damaged several others.\nThe drone\u2019s existence was first hinted at in September 2023, when Ukraine\u2019s state arms exporter Spetstechnoexport showcased a prototype at an international defense expo. Public interest, however, surged after a full video report earlier this year highlighted the drone\u2019s range and capabilities.\nAccording to that presentation, the FP-1 has a combat range of approximately 700 kilometers and carries a warhead weighing around 50 kilograms. However, later estimates suggest the warhead could weigh as much as 60 kilograms, depending on the explosive configuration used.\nIn a March Telegram post, the Russian channel Shot claimed the FP-1 was equipped with an OFB-60-UYa warhead, containing a KZ-6 charge and blocks of TNT.\nThe drone\u2019s operational range can vary significantly depending on the payload weight. During the official demo, developers claimed a maximum range of up to 1,600 kilometers, though they did not specify the weight configuration used to achieve that distance.\n\u201cThis drone was made in Ukraine and was very quickly scaled up. It\u2019s something we can share with our partners,\u201d said Anna Hvozdiar, Ukraine\u2019s Deputy Minister for Strategic Industries, during the drone\u2019s presentation.\nHer statement corroborates earlier assessments by analysts, indicating that the FP-1 is already in full-scale serial production and has begun to attract interest from Ukraine\u2019s international partners.\nIts long-range capability, modular design, and destructive potential make it one of the most significant additions to Ukraine\u2019s growing arsenal of domestically-produced unmanned systems.\nEarlier, Ukraine\u2019s Defense Intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov confirmed that two Russian Su-30SM fighter jets were shot down over the Black Sea using AIM-9 air-to-air missiles launched from Magura-class unmanned surface vessels.\nThe strike marks the first documented instance of a sea drone downing manned fighter aircraft with such weaponry."

      "text": "Putin expressed willingness on Wednesday to meet Zelenskyy in Moscow, but Ukraine's foreign minister rejected the idea. Meanwhile, Trump continues to push for peace talks that would end Russia's war in Ukraine, now in its fourth year.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin expressed his willingness on Wednesday to arrange a face-to-face meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but only if the summit is held in Moscow.\nThe Russian leader, who spoke at a press conference following the Victory Day parade in Beijing on Wednesday, said that US President Donald Trump asked for the two to sit down and discuss bringing an end to Russia's war in Ukraine.\n\"I said yes, it was possible, let him come to Moscow,\" Putin said.\n\"I've never excluded the possibility of meeting with him. But does it make sense to meet with him,\" he added, again questioning the legitimacy of Zelenskyy's presidency.\n\"We could do that, I've never refused to do that if that leads to some positive outcomes.\"\nThe Kremlin has repeatedly brought up the issue of Zelenskyy's presidential term having expired, despite Ukraine not being legally able to hold elections while it is at war and with a portion of its territory under occupation.\nIn response, Ukraine\u2019s foreign minister rejected the idea of holding face-to-face talks with Putin, if they are to be held in the Russian capital.\nIn a post on X on Wednesday evening, Andrii Sybiha listed seven countries that had offered to host peace talks, which he called \u201cserious proposals\u201d.\n\u201cYet, Putin continues to mess around with everyone by making knowingly unacceptable proposals. Only increased pressure can force Russia to finally get serious about peace process,\u201d he said.\nThe latest words from Putin come after a flurry of meetings organised by Trump in August, including a summit with Putin in Alaska, quickly followed by another one with Zelenskyy and European and NATO leaders in Washington.\nThe meeting in Alaska did not produce immediate results, with Trump stating at the time that \"we didn\u2019t get there, but we have a good chance to get there.\"\nHowever, the US president has since pushed for progress in ending Russia's war, vowing that Ukraine would receive substantial security guarantees as part of any future peace deal, as Europe remains \"the first line of defence.\"\nMoscow's war continues\nMoscow has previously repeatedly rejected the possibility of direct Zelenskyy-Putin talks, citing various reasons, including that preparations are not yet complete, questioning Zelenskyy's legitimacy, and stating that they never agreed to any meeting in the first place.\nKremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov, who was present at the Alaska summit in August, said on Tuesday that no agreement was made between Trump and Putin to meet with the Ukrainian leader.\nOn Monday, Putin openly blamed the West and NATO for his ongoing all-out war against Ukraine during his address at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin.\nPutin defended his full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, telling those gathered that the war was \"a result of a coup in Ukraine, which was supported and provoked by the West\" \u2014 a reference to bloody Euromaidan protests in Kyiv, which ended in the removal of Kremlin-allied President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014.\n\"The second reason for the crisis is the West's constant attempts to drag Ukraine into NATO,\" Putin added.\nThe Russian president has repeatedly made similar accusations in the past without providing evidence.\nMeanwhile, Russia has continued its daily bombardment of Ukraine, launching a barrage of more than 500 drones and two dozen missiles at several regions in Ukraine overnight on Wednesday.\nIt has also intensified its summer offensive in eastern Ukraine aimed at occupying all of the Donetsk region."

  "argos_summary": "On September 3, Ukraine suffered casualties from a Russian air strike that launched 526 projectiles, while the Ukrainian Air Force intercepted 430 drones and 21 missiles. President Zelenskyy condemned the attack as a display of Russian impunity and vowed a layered defense. Russian President Putin offered a face\u2011to\u2011face meeting in Moscow, which Kyiv rejected, insisting no real peace intent. Concurrently, Russian fuel shortages from drone strikes on refineries have driven domestic gasoline prices up 54% and forced export bans, while India\u2019s growing imports of Russian crude have helped stabilize global markets.",
