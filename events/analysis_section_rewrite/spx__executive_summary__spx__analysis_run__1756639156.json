      "feedback": "Your draft is already on target—just tighten the causal chain, add granular citations, and embed the probability and watch‑list logic in a single, 4‑sentence bullet format. 1) Replace the first sentence with a causal chain that explicitly links the Fed’s September 20 25‑bp cut (FAN5RYW6T) to lower discount rates, compressed tech earnings, and a 6‑9 % downside on spx (FAN5RYW6T). 2) In the second sentence, split the upside scenario into two linked clauses: (a) resilient tech earnings (FAN5RYW6T) and (b) a delayed November cut with inflation easing to 2.0 % (FAN5RYW6T) that would lift spx 1‑4 %. 3) Add a probability anchor: “We assign a 60 % probability to the –6 % to –9 % downside.” 4) In the third sentence, list the primary downside risks with magnitude ranges: Fed pause/hike (+0.5‑1 bp), rapid inflation easing (core PCE < 2.5 % → upside 1‑3 %), and a tech earnings rebound (concentration risk mitigated → upside 2‑5 %). 5) Convert the watch‑list into a concise bullet: “Watch Q3 earnings of AAPL, MSFT, NVDA; September 5 payrolls; October 15 CPI; October 25 core PCE; and Fed policy statements (September 20, October 15) for confirmation or reversal.” 6) Ensure each bullet ends with the handle (spx) and the source ID (FAN5RYW6T) for traceability. This will satisfy the 4‑sentence limit, keep the focus strictly on spx, and provide a clear, actionable view.",
