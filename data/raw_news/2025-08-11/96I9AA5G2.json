  "description": "Daniella Pierson, who made Forbes\u2019 \u201c30 under 30\u201d list in 2020, has admitted to using fake email accounts to make her one-woman startup look bigger.",
  "content": "A millennial mogul denied bonuses to her employees as her business imploded \u2014 even while she spent lavishly on items that included $5,000 Chanel rollerblades, according to a report.\n\nDaniella Pierson, who turned 30 last Monday, rose to prominence with a women-focused lifestyle newsletter, The Newsette, that she launched while attending Boston University in 2015.\n\nHer entrepreneurial hustle landed her on Forbes\u2019 \u201c30 under 30\u201d list of notable media figures in 2020 \u2014 helping her rub shoulders with A-lister Selena Gomez, pop singer Jewel and designer Diane Von Furstenberg, according to Forbes.\n\nThe next year, investor Peter Rahal took a 1.25% stake in her budding media company at a valuation of $200 million.\n\nBut Pierson\u2019s self-made image has become bruised by constant exaggerations that call into question her business acumen, according to more than a dozen sources who spoke to Forbes.\n\nShe has admitted to using fake email accounts to make her one-woman startup look bigger, inflating subscriptions by double-counting readers and boasting that brands like Nike spent \u201ctens of millions\u201d a year with her when no deal ever topped $1 million, the outlet reported.\n\nThe report described Pierson as an effective self-promoter \u2014 earning a reputation as a rising star in women\u2019s entrepreneurship by cultivating celebrity friendships, landing magazine covers and touting her companies as booming successes.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, former colleagues and business records cited by Forbes suggest a pattern of overstatement, misrepresentation, and high-profile ventures that have either faltered or collapsed.\n\nMultiple ex-employees told Forbes that Pierson denied staff their annual bonuses and, minutes later, posted Instagram Stories flaunting new Chanel rollerblades and a marble kitchen remodel for her apartment in Soho\u2014 a jarring look for someone branding herself as a champion of women.\n\nFormer staff told Forbes that The Newsette\u2019s workforce is down to roughly a quarter of its peak, and revenue has dropped from the $40 million she claimed in 2021 to under $4 million in recent years.\n\nPierson had followed the success of Newsette with the launch of Wondermind, a mental health startup she co-founded Gomez and the singer\u2019s mother, Mandy Teefey, in 2021.\n\nShe was forced out of Wondermind last year after clashing with her co-CEO, according to the Forbes report.\n\nPierson\u2019s own account of The Newsette\u2019s origins includes embellishment, Forbes reported.\n\nIn a Stanford Graduate School of Business talk, she described creating fake email accounts to give the impression of a bigger staff and posing as an intern to recruit subscribers.\n\nPierson also managed to leverage her personal ties with Furstenberg, her \u201cfairy godmother,\u201d who introduced her to several connections at Amazon, including company founder Jeff Bezos.\n\n\u201cI have known Daniella for years. Her drive is impressive and I am fond of her. My relationship with her is more personal than business,\u201d von Furstenberg told The Post.\n\nPierson was able to parlay her newfound ties to Amazon into a marketing campaign in which the e-commerce giant featured female founders on its homepage to mark International Women\u2019s Day.\n\nAmazon also became one of the first and largest clients of Newland, Pierson\u2019s marketing agency, a partnership which earned The Newsette Media Group tens of millions in sales.\n\nBy 2021, company sales totaled $34 million, according to internal documents \u2014 less than Pierson\u2019s repeated public claims but still the most it had ever made.\n\nThat year, she secured investment from Rahal, founder of RXBar, who took a stake in her company without reportedly looking at its finances.\n\nThe $200 million valuation translated into an estimated personal stake for Pierson worth nearly $170 million. When combined with her Wondermind shares and other assets, Forbes listed her as worth $220 million in 2021.\n\nShortly after the deal, the company\u2019s main revenue source \u2014 Newland\u2019s marketing work for Amazon and Mattel \u2014 began to crumble.\n\nBoth clients ended their relationships, and by the end of 2023, Newland had been shut down, though Pierson continued to present it as active, according to Forbes.\n\nFormer staff told the publication that she also misrepresented the scale of brand deals, telling clients companies like Nike and Ulta Beauty were spending tens of millions of dollars annually when no single contract topped $1 million.\n\nInternal records from 2022 cited by Forbes show she overstated subscriber numbers as well. Last year, she claimed 1.3 million subscribers across three newsletters, without clarifying that many were duplicates.\n\nMedia valuation expert Kevin Kamen reviewed The Newsette\u2019s latest figures and social reach for Forbes and estimated it is now worth \u201cno more than $12.2 million.\u201d\n\nAt Wondermind, Pierson\u2019s co-leadership lasted about a year before she was pushed out, according to former staff.\n\nTwo-thirds of the 15-person team were later laid off, Forbes reported.\n\nEx-employees from both companies describe her management style as volatile, with frequent outbursts, micromanaging and public criticism of staff work, according to the Forbes report.\n\nSeveral recalled her denying annual bonuses shortly before posting on Instagram about luxury purchases.\n\nThe Post has sought comment from Pierson, Gomez and Teefey. An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nIn 2023, Pierson nearly became part of an even bigger headline \u2014 the potential sale of Forbes Media.\n\nLuminar Technologies CEO Austin Russell led a bid to acquire the outlet, and Pierson was slated to join the board, according to Forbes.\n\nInvestor calls during fundraising drew mixed reactions, with some participants questioning her involvement.\n\nShe took charge of public relations, issuing a press release that announced an \u201coversubscribed\u201d deal and included a composite group photo positioning her at the center.\n\nThe acquisition collapsed two months later, but Pierson continued to list herself online as a Forbes board member until her agency removed the claim this month, according to the report.\n\nAs Forbes prepared to publish its investigation over the weekend, Pierson posted on Instagram accusing unnamed parties of a \u201csmear campaign\u201d against her and her companies, vowing to continue investing \u201cmillions of my own dollars into helping women.\u201d\n\nRahal now interacts with her ventures only sparingly. Earlier this year, he responded to one of her LinkedIn announcements with a single clown emoji.",

      "text": "Daniella Pierson has cozied up to everyone from Diane von Furstenberg to Selena Gomez, burnishing her image as her businesses unraveled. A case study in how hubris is bad for business.\nDaniella Pierson turned 30 on Monday\u2014a milestone acknowledged by a bevy of successful friends, from Spanx founder Sara Blakely to the singer Jewel to designer Diane von Furstenberg. It\u2019s an especially auspicious birthday for an entrepreneur who spent her 20s building a lifestyle newsletter called The Newsette, which she launched as a student at Boston University in 2015; garnering a feature in USA Today in 2019; debuting on our Forbes \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list in 2020; appearing on the the cover of Entrepreneur magazine in 2021 (with Selena Gomez) for a second company, mental health startup Wondermind; ranking number 16 on Inc. 5000\u2019s list of fastest growing private companies in 2022. And giving talks and speeches throughout, at schools from Stanford to BU and media gatherings from the Forbes Power Women\u2019s Summit to Newsweek\u2019s Women\u2019s Global Impact Forum just this week.\nHer high profile owes itself to brains and hustle\u2014and, it turns out, a consistent history of large exaggerations and extreme self-promotion, those latter two traits reinforcing the other. Over the course of the last three months, Forbes spoke to more than a dozen people who\u2019ve worked closely with her and reviewed documents, press releases and videos of all four of her recent business ventures. What emerges is someone who fails to understand the difference between entrepreneurial zeal and extreme hyperbole\u2014and now faces a potential reckoning.\nFor all the celebrity plaudits and press love, Pierson\u2019s businesses seem to be unraveling. Business partnerships have collapsed, the staff at her original startup has shrunk to roughly one-quarter its peak size, and revenue has tumbled from $40 million in 2021 (if you believe Pierson) to less than $4 million in recent years, according to four former employees. (Pierson declined to comment on any revenue figures after 2021.) Kicked out of a second startup she cofounded, Pierson is now starting her third venture in four years, that one also seemingly riddled with problems.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that she actually cares about building a successful business as much as she cares about being able to say she\u2019s a badass CEO,\u201d says one former employee who, like others in this article, spoke under condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. \u201cIt\u2019s all smoke and mirrors.\u201d\nThe daughter of a Colombian immigrant oral surgeon mother and a car dealership owner father from Niagara Falls, Pierson grew up in Jacksonville, Florida. She speaks often of her early struggles with ADHD, depression and particularly OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder).\nShe says she got mediocre grades in school and was called the \u201cdumb twin\u201d compared to her sister, Alex, who received straight As. (Her sister, who writes under the name Alex Aster, is now a bestselling author of young adult fiction, including the romantic fantasy series Lightlark.)\nPierson started Newsette using tactics that would become something of a playbook: scrappy\u2014and disingenuous. In those early days, she sent messages from fake emails to make it seem like the company had more employees than just her. She also posed as an intern, messaging friends of friends to subscribe and telling them if they successfully referred 10 others, they could call themselves \u201cbrand ambassadors\u201d on their resum\u00e9s. \u201cI made it look like it was bigger than it was,\u201d she said in a talk at the Stanford Graduate School of Business last year. \u201cI literally just faked it \u2019til I made it.\u201d\nA notable milestone came when Pierson, then about 24, met Diane von Furstenberg, the legendary fashion designer known for her iconic wrap dress. Married to billionaire Barry Diller, von Furstenberg introduced her to a host of other celebrities, as well as connections at Amazon. Newsette then ran a campaign for Amazon highlighting female founders on the e-commerce giant\u2019s homepage on International Women\u2019s Day in 2020. Soon after, Pierson started Newland, a creative marketing agency within Newsette, structured to connect influencers with Amazon and other brands.\nThings looked promising. In 2021, the company generated $34 million in sales, according to a document shared by a spokesperson\u2014$6 million less than what Pierson has frequently said, but still its best year ever. Newsette\u2019s spokesperson clarified that the company \u201cbooked\u201d $40 million in sales in 2021, but that Amazon, then its biggest customer, paid the remaining sum in the first quarter of 2022.\nAt this point, Pierson reached out to Forbes to nominate herself for its Richest Self-Made Women list. In looking into her company in 2022, Forbes confirmed that RXBar founder Peter Rahal had come on as an outside investor. Rahal, who sold 50% of his former company for $300 million five years earlier, has since put money into some 100 businesses. His 1.25% investment valued Newsette at $200 million.\nMore than the cash, Rahal\u2019s bet on Pierson gave her clout. Based on that deal\u2019s numbers, Forbes valued Pierson\u2019s own 84% stake in the company at just under $170 million. At the time, she also owned more than a third of Wondermind, a mental wellness startup she cofounded with Selena Gomez and Gomez\u2019s mom, Mandy Teefey. Wondermind was then worth $100 million after attracting $5 million in a funding round led by tennis star Serena Williams\u2019 venture capital firm. Pierson also eagerly showed Forbes millions in other assets, enough for us to declare her in August 2022 \u201cone of the wealthiest women of color in the U.S.,\u201d worth $220 million and, then age 27, \u201cyounger than just about any self-made female entrepreneur with a nine figure fortune.\u201d\nThat Forbes story marked a turning point for Pierson, according to former employees who say she repeatedly used the net worth figure to sell others on her success\u2014even when her businesses turned south.\nAnd it turns out the net worth figure she loves to cite was even less grounded in reality. Yes, Rahal invested at a $200 million valuation, which is traditionally a blue chip way to appraise a private company. But he now tells Forbes that he didn\u2019t even look at the financials when he made the investment. In other words, the company touting its $200 million valuation had no real chance of any other serious investor touching it at that price.\nThe Newland business\u2014which had become Newsette\u2019s main source of revenue\u2014soon started to falter. Partnerships with Amazon and Mattel, its only significant clients, fell apart. Amazon stopped being a client in late 2022, per former employees. (Amazon declined to comment and Mattel did not reply to a request for comment.) In January 2023, Pierson took to Instagram to drum up business, claiming that demand was high: \u201cNewsette Media Group keeps the agency under wraps because of our waitlist, but hit us up at GoNewland.com and let\u2019s see if we can make magic together.\u201d She began laying off staff and shut down the Newland segment entirely at the end of 2023, according to several people who were employed at the company then, though never publicly announced it. One person with knowledge of the situation says Pierson continues to pitch agency capabilities as though Newland is still active, and Pierson has continued, even this year, to include it on her email signature.\nThings haven\u2019t been that much better at the original newsletter business. Former employees say Pierson has described it being in difficult financial straits over the years, claiming at times to have partly funded it out of her own pocket.\nTwo sources say she also wildly exaggerates to clients the value of her company\u2014using the $200 million figure even after revenue nosedived\u2014and the amount that other brands spend on Newsette, claiming that customers like Nike and Ulta Beauty are \u201cspending tens of millions on us per year.\u201d Four former employees tell Forbes that is not true: no individual brand deal for the newsletter ever hit $1 million, and deals were usually in the tens of thousands or low hundreds of thousands of dollars. (Branded content is Newsette\u2019s main source of revenue.) Nike did not reply to a request for comment; Ulta said it does not have an active partnership with Newsette and declined to comment on past spend.\nAnother of her embellishments: subscriber numbers. Around the time Rahal came on board in 2022, Pierson cited subscribers in excess of 500,000. But according to two internal documents, subscribers totaled just over 400,000 at that time. \u201cThey got us all on the phone and said, \u2018Stop talking about the number of subscribers we have,\u201d says a former employee. \u201cThey never said why. But it was because, I think, we didn\u2019t actually have that many.\u201d She adds that her team was also asked to start describing the number of subscribers in ranges, rather than specific numbers.\nThe overstating hasn\u2019t stopped. Newsette had about 500,000 subscribers last year, per internal documents, but new business pitches claimed to have over 1.3 million subscribers across the company\u2019s three newsletter products. It didn\u2019t specify that most readers of the newer weekend shopping and wellness bulletins also receive the main Newsette offering, meaning that those 1.3 million were not unique subscribers.\nToday, Newsette\u2019s business is likely worth \u201cno more than $12.2 million,\u201d according to media valuation expert Kevin Kamen, who reviewed the most recent financial figures and subscribers Forbes obtained, as well as its social media following. Emphasis on \u201cno more than.\u201d\nWondermind, which Pierson spent most of 2022 running as co-CEO with Gomez\u2019 mother Mandy Teefey, is in even worse shape. Pierson was ultimately pushed out in January 2023, after the two women clashed, according to four former staffers. \u201cShe would not characterize it as \u2018pushed out,\u2019\u201d says a spokesperson for Pierson. \u201cLeaving Wondermind was a very difficult decision, but she was proud of what they had built in the time there.\u201d Regardless, problems at Wondermind snowballed. Two thirds of its 15 employees were laid off in May.\nWhen it comes to leadership, Pierson promotes herself as a motivational uplifter of women. \u201cI have made it my life\u2019s mission to ensure that NOBODY gets knocked down by false labels or barriers to success. I\u2019m here for you\u2014with a hand that will always help you back up,\u201d she posted on Instagram on her 30th birthday.\nBut that is not how many former employees describe her. The 11 people who worked with Pierson at Newsette or Wondermind interviewed for this article describe her as prone to fits of anger. They say she berated employees, often claiming their work was \u201cembarrassing\u201d and that she could do all of their jobs better.\n\u201cThere was definitely this culture of Danny having two personalities,\u201d says a former employee. \u201cOne was online, and with us she was different.\u201d Ex-staff say she repeatedly interfered with their ability to do their jobs, covertly reading their emails, rescheduling meetings over a dozen times, hiring industry experts and ignoring their suggestions. She\u2019d jeopardize relationships with clients, dominating sales calls with details from her personal story and turning down future campaigns they offered because the money wasn\u2019t immediate.\n\u201cShe denied people on our team their annual bonuses, people that had worked really hard,\u201d says another ex-staffer. \u201cAnd then like five minutes later she was on Instagram posting all these stories of her new Chanel roller blades and of the new marble kitchen she\u2019s installing in her Soho apartment.\u201d\nAdds one former employee, \u201cI have never before in my life worked with someone who knew so little, but thought that she knew everything.\u201d\nPierson\u2019s rise, powered in part by promoting her one-time net worth estimate from Forbes, almost led her into an unexpected deal\u2026 Forbes itself.\nIn 2023, Austin Russell\u2014who three years earlier became the world\u2019s youngest self-made billionaire at age 25 when Luminar Technologies, the company he founded as a teenager to enable self-driving cars to navigate, went public via a SPAC\u2014assumed the lead role in a high-profile bid to buy Forbes Media. Two previous deals for Forbes had fallen through in the late hours because the controlling bidders were foreign entities. As a major U.S. media outlet with access to a large subscriber database, Forbes potentially falls into a category of strategic assets whose sale to non-Americans requires approval by the Treasury Department.\nRussell, a California-born Stanford dropout, had no such issues. But while Russell was enthusiastic about the purchase, multiple sources close to the deal say, and he would maintain an 82% controlling interest, he also had a full-time job as the CEO of a publicly-traded company and no experience in the media business. So in stepped Pierson, a fellow Forbes 30 Under 30 honoree and new acquaintance. \u201cIt all happened so fast,\u201d says someone outside Forbes familiar with the deal.\nThe purchase already had a star-studded lineup supporting it, including the founders of Brex, ScaleAI and Plaid, as well as superstar names like Kevin Hart, Tony Robbins and Jimmy \u201cMr. Beast\u201d Donaldson. The idea was that Pierson would invest a relatively token amount, then serve as an active board member.\nIt didn\u2019t go so well. In calls with large institutional investors, according to two people\u2014neither affiliated with Forbes\u2014who attended multiple fundraising meetings, Pierson proved polarizing. While some were impressed, \u201csome people definitely did not like her,\u201d says one. Adds the other: \u201cPeople were like \u2018We can\u2019t invest in this.\u2019 It was that kind of reaction, they couldn\u2019t understand how someone like this could be involved.\u201d\nPierson also immediately took charge of the bidders\u2019 public relations. In September, the group took the unusual step of issuing a press release announcing that the deal was \u201csubstantially oversubscribed\u201d and naming the board of the new company that would own Forbes\u2014even though the deal hadn\u2019t closed yet. Pierson, according to multiple sources involved, engineered the announcement, which described her as \u201crecognized by Forbes as one of the youngest and wealthiest self-made women of color in the U.S.\u201d\nExtremely unusual for a press release, a group image of the new principals sat atop the announcements\u2014individual shots stitched together like a business version of The Avengers. The world-famous Mr. Beast and Robbins on one side, the formidable Hart and Russell (and his 82% controlling stake) on the other. At the dead center, standing slightly above the others, her hand on her hip: Daniella Pierson.\nTwo months later, the closing deadline passed and the deal fell through. Pierson has since told people in private that \u201c\u2018Forbes wanted me to be the CEO,\u2019\u201d according to two people with knowledge of her conversations.\nDespite the deal\u2019s collapse, Pierson still describes herself on her speaker\u2019s agent web page as a board member of Forbes\u2014which is wholly incorrect. A spokesperson for Pierson says the claim comes from when Pierson was en route to join the board as part of that possible 2023 purchase and that the page is \u201cout of date.\u201d Yet the page also lists her venture Chasm, which launched less than three months ago. (Update: On Thursday afternoon, August 7, CAA\u2014the agency representing Pierson\u2014removed from her web page the claim that Pierson was a Forbes board member.)\nNo matter the problems behind the scenes, publicly Pierson has never cracked. She continues to present herself as an underdog who\u2019s overcome great odds and earned a place in the world of glamorous female business elites. She has a knack for leveraging her ever-expanding network into financial opportunities.\nFor instance, her almost-fellow-board member Kevin Hart introduced Pierson to Kristin Lemkau, CEO of J.P. Morgan Wealth Management. Over lunch in January 2024, Pierson wooed Lemkau with her latest concept: Be a Breadwinner, a company that would empower women to become their own breadwinners by promoting financial planning. \u201cShe\u2019s like, \u2018We have the same idea,\u2019\u201d Pierson recalled in a Forbes interview she did with Lemkau last March, \u201cAnd it literally came from that conversation, and I\u2019ve never seen any company move this quickly. It\u2019s truly a partnership.\u201d\nPierson told other outlets at the time that Breadwinner would eventually include a newsletter, podcast series, book and a venture capital fund. Lemkau told Forbes that the Chase mobile app\u2019s free wealth-planning tool would integrate some of Breadwinner\u2019s content.\nJ.P. Morgan sponsored a \u201cbread carpet\u201d event on March 20, 2024 at its Manhattan headquarters. Pierson declared it the official launch of the company on social media and in the press. Speakers included Diane von Furstenberg and poet Rupi Kaur. Von Furstenberg, who remains a close mentor to Pierson, tells Forbes that she didn\u2019t realize the event also served as a company launch. \u201cI personally only thought it was a conference,\u201d she says. \u201cI mean, she asked me to speak at J.P. Morgan, so I said yes.\u201d\nThere were similar struggles with the media launch of Breadwinner. Pierson pitched an \u201cexclusive\u201d to Forbes, which was killed, given her recent ties to a potential Forbes purchase and increasingly desperate, hyperbolic tendencies. Pierson\u2019s response defaulted to what an exaggerator might do when cornered: She threatened.\n\u201cSince there is absolutely zero conflict of interest, blocking the story seems like a repression of freedom of speech or some sort of discrimination,\u201d she wrote to a Forbes reporter in March of last year, before escalating to the company\u2019s chief content officer and CEO: \u201cI just explained clearly that your \u2018reason\u2019 is actually not valid\u2026 As a woman of color who was amplified by your platform, I sincerely thought unethical, discriminatory, or personal feelings were not part of your editorial process\u2026Let me know if you have an answer to this or if I need to loop in my family office team.\u201d\nSince then, Be a Breadwinner appears to have gone nowhere. Pierson has stopped mentioning it, and the website still says that \u201cBreadwinner\u2019s content is coming soon.\u201d\n\u201cWe were never in a partnership with her,\u201d says Veronica Navarro, head of communications at J.P. Morgan Wealth Management. \u201cWe promoted the event, and that was the end of the collaboration with her,\u201d adding that Breadwinner content did appear in the Chase app for an unspecified amount of time.\nPierson recently transitioned the Be a Breadwinner Instagram page (which has 13 followers) to link to Chasm, a new venture she launched in May to address gender disparities in venture capital funding. A spokesperson for Pierson says the idea for Breadwinner has now turned into Chasm: \u201cShe\u2019s always been passionate about supporting female entrepreneurs.\u201d\nPitched as an invite-only club of \u201cthe most successful men and women in the world\u201d who contribute $25,000 annually, Chasm promises to award monthly grants and offer resources to female founders. It claims in marketing materials to have already partnered with 50 high-profile investors and entrepreneurs, including Spanx founder and billionaire Sara Blakely, Drybar founder Ali Webb, Tony Robbins and Instacart CEO Fidji Simo. Yet none of these advertised \u201cmembers\u201d attended the kick-off on May 20\u2014an expensive affair at luxury watchmaker Audemars Piguet\u2019s swank AP House in Manhattan where espresso martinis featured the name \u201cChasm\u201d inscribed in foam.\nNor do those \u201cmembers\u201d appear to have shared anything about the company on social media or spoken about it publicly. Forbes reached out to every known name: Webb confirmed her participation, a Simo spokesperson denied that she is a member and others did not reply to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Pierson insists Simo is a member and \u201cclose friend\u201d and says Pierson is paying her membership fee to ensure involvement.\nAs Forbes was finishing this article, Pierson took to Instagram to post a preemptive response.\n\u201cIn the last 24 hours, people who represent everything that my gender equality initiatives have fought to change, have launched a smear campaign against me and my companies. The result has been an eagerness to spread false statements and fabricated information intended to discredit me and eliminate my ability to continue to put millions of my own dollars into helping women.\u201d\n\u201cI will not allow anyone to get away with defiling the character of me and my companies with uninformed speculation and outright lies.\u201d\nOne person in a position of informed speculation doesn\u2019t seem impressed. Peter Rahal still owns the 1.25% of Newsette that he vastly overpaid for, the investment that provided Pierson her inflated net worth figure, but the state of their relationship is murky. When Forbes asked him for comment, he replied, \u201cDanielle is a great entrepreneur\u201d\u2014misspelling her name. And when Pierson was making announcements about Chasm on LinkedIn this May, he publicly responded with a comment.\nIt was a clown emoji."

      "text": "Starbucks shuts down another San Francisco cafe \u2014 closing more than a dozen locations in city over past two years\nStarbucks has pulled the plug on another San Francisco cafe, marking the latest in a string of closures that has stripped the city of more than a dozen locations in just two years.\nThe shop at 295 California Street, a fixture downtown for nearly two decades, shut its doors Friday, according to the San Francisco Business Times.\nIt\u2019s at least the sixth Starbucks to close in the city since last September \u2014 the fourth to close so far this year. It also comes on top of seven others the coffee chain shuttered in 2023.\nThe closures reflect a mix of economic pressure, shifting consumer habits and a broader rethink of the company\u2019s store strategy.\nRising labor costs are part of the challenge, especially in San Francisco, where wages are among the highest in the country.\nLike other quick service restaurants operating in the Golden State, Starbucks is bound by a new fast food minimum wage law to pay their employees $20 an hour \u2014 up from $16.50 an hour before the legislation went into effect on April 1, 2024.\nA study published last month by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the minimum wage hike has cost the state thousands of jobs.\nBut a spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom questioned the veracity of the study, saying the findings \u201chave not been peer-reviewed or been subject to the review by the NBER Board of Directors that accompanies official NBER publications.\u201d\nAides to Newsom point to a UC Berkeley study which found \u201cno negative wage or employment effects\u201d as a result of the new law.\nSan Francisco has experienced a sharp wave of retail closures in the past two years, with national chains, luxury brands and grocery stores citing theft, high operating costs and sluggish downtown recovery as key factors.\nMajor names including Rolex, Macy\u2019s, Walgreens, Target, Whole Foods and Nordstrom have either shut locations or scaled back operations, often pointing to surging retail theft and safety concerns that have driven up security expenses and deterred customers.\nWhile the city and state have enacted new anti-theft laws and revitalization efforts, the ongoing loss of storefronts underscores the steep challenges in restoring San Francisco\u2019s retail core.\nWilliam Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia told the San Francisco Standard that high labor costs and the slow post-pandemic recovery make \u201csome of the economics tough\u201d for Starbucks in the city.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no secret that labor is just innately more expensive in San Francisco, and the city proper has been lagging in terms of return-to-work and office occupancy,\u201d Zackfia told the Standard.\nSome locations were lost when leases expired. Others were cut to maintain what the company calls a \u201chealthy store portfolio,\u201d a move that often means trimming underperforming sites or reducing overlap in areas where shops compete with one another.\nThat strain is compounded by the city\u2019s slow post-pandemic recovery, with office towers still far from full.\nWilliam Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia told the San Francisco Standard that these factors make \u201csome of the economics tough\u201d for Starbucks in the city.\nService has also become a sticking point. Starbucks recently logged its sixth straight quarter of falling same-store sales \u2014 a measure of revenue at cafes open for at least a year \u2014 and saw transaction sizes shrink.\nZackfia told the Standard that slower service times have frustrated customers.\n\u201cWhen speed and service suffer, people start to question why they\u2019re spending as much as they are on their beverage,\u201d she said.\nIn San Francisco, the coffee giant is also abandoning its pickup-only model, where customers order through an app rather than at the counter.\nStarbucks CEO Brian Niccol announced the company will scrap the format nationwide by 2026, describing it as \u201coverly transactional and lacking the warmth and human connection\u201d Starbucks wants to deliver.\nBetween 80 and 90 such locations across the US will either close or be converted to traditional cafes. One of those could be the Drumm Street shop near the Embarcadero, though Starbucks has not confirmed its fate.\nSome longtime customers see the closures as a sign of overexpansion.\nReal estate experts have noted that Starbucks, like other major retailers, opened too many stores clustered closely together, according to the Standard.\nThat led to an eventual need for consolidation, with the hope that remaining cafes could absorb business from those that shut down.\nThe trend isn\u2019t unique to Starbucks. Drugstore chains like CVS and Walgreens, which also once expanded rapidly in San Francisco, have closed dozens of locations in recent years.\nThe city now has 40% fewer pharmacies than it did a decade ago.\nStill, the Starbucks pullback is striking. In October 2023, the company operated 59 company-owned locations in San Francisco. By August 2025, that number had fallen to between 35 and 37, not counting outlets inside other retailers like Target or Safeway, which are licensed rather than company-run.\nThat means the city has lost roughly half its Starbucks in ten years and about 13 to 15 in just the past two.\nFor customers, the changes have been bittersweet.\nMike, a regular at the California Street cafe, called the closures a revenue-driven decision.\n\u201cYou have to minimize liabilities,\u201d he told the Standard, adding that younger generations might also be steering away from large corporate chains in favor of independent coffee shops.\nCompetition from local favorites also plays a role. One customer suggested the Financial District\u2019s options, like Devil\u2019s Teeth Baking Company, may be drawing people away from Starbucks.\nAnother speculated that new owners of certain buildings, including the California Street property, might have plans to overhaul the retail space.\nWhether the closures will stop anytime soon remains unclear. The company still has 37 storefronts across the city, but with more pickup-only cafes likely to close or convert, the total could drop further.\nNiccol has said the company is working to improve speed and service by hiring more staff, but in high-cost, slow-to-recover cities like San Francisco, even that strategy may have limits.\nA spokesperson for San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie referred The Post to several announcements made by his office, including reducing red tape so as to allow small businesses to obtain permits quicker as well as waiving permit fees and initial business registration.\nThe Post has sought comment from Starbucks and Newsom\u2019s office."

      "text": "Big Tech workers top donations to Mamdani campaign in headache for Google, Meta\nBig Tech workers, including from Google and Meta, were among the biggest group of donors to Zohran Mamdani\u2019s mayoral campaign \u2014 creating a fresh headache for companies in the Big Apple that could feel the brunt of the self-proclaimed Democratic socialist\u2019s policies, The Post has learned.\nThe 33-year-old upstart has spooked New York business and tech leaders \u2014 many of whom fear that his vow to raise taxes on the wealthy and past calls to defund the police will spark a mass exodus similar to what San Francisco experienced under progressive leaders in recent years.\nHowever, their underlings have thrown their financial support behind the front-runner for City Hall.\nRank-and-file Google employees donated nearly $40,500 to Mamdani\u2019s campaign through July 11 \u2014 more than any other company or institution, according to NYC campaign finance data reviewed by The Post.\nMeta workers chipped in more than $10,500, ranking seventh on the list, followed by Amazon employees, who donated nearly $9,000.\nCampaign funds also flowed in from employees at New York City mainstays like tech and media firm Bloomberg ($8,816), Spotify ($7,415), Block ($6,265), Squarespace ($3,957) and MongoDB ($3,900), the data showed.\nOutside of the tech sector, Mamdani received significant support from workers at NY-based colleges and city agencies. The Columbia University system ranked second overall with nearly $33,000 in donations, followed by the NYC Department of Education ($26,214), the New York University system ($24,331) and the CUNY system ($18,336), the data showed.\nNew York City\u2019s campaign finance regulations require donors to disclose their employer if their contributions exceed $100. The stats do not include donors who listed alternate designations, such as being unemployed, self-employed or retired.\nOverall, Mamdani raised $816,014 from roughly 10,500 donors from June 25 through July 11, with more than $350,000 of that cash coming from outside New York, records show.\nRepresentatives for Google and Meta declined to comment. Amazon and the Mamdani campaign did not return requests for comment.\nJohn Borthwick, a famed tech investor and CEO of NY-based Betaworks, said the donations from tech workers \u201cdoesn\u2019t surprise me at all\u201d because \u201cyoung people in particular want change.\u201d\nMamdani, who handily beat former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary, has vowed to lower the cost of living through policy proposals that include free public buses, a freeze on regulated rents, universal child care starting at 6 weeks old and a pilot program for city-run grocery stores.\nCrtics say his plans could cause chaos in the housing market, among other unwanted side effects \u2014 including businesses running for the exits.\nTech giants are particularly focused on the quality-of-life impacts of Mamdani\u2019s policies on issues like public safety, housing and education because those are key to making the city an attractive destination.\nCompanies left San Francisco in droves due to rampant crime and homelessness, which some critics attributed to \u201cwoke\u201d policies adopted by city leadership.\nDrew Oetting, president of tech-focused venture firm 8VC, described San Francisco in 2022 as \u201cprobably the worst run city in the United States,\u201d while Elon Musk quipped in 2023 that the city looked \u201cpost-apocalyptic.\u201d\n\u201cWhat we saw when tech companies fled San Francisco \u2014 that was not because of tech policy,\u201d said Julie Samuels, president and CEO of the influential industry group Tech:NYC.\n\u201cThat was because of what was going on in San Francisco.\u201d\nInsiders say companies are struggling to balance the need to voice real concerns about the impact a Mamdani administration would have on their businesses against the risk of alienating progressive workers who appear to be broadly supportive of him.\nCompanies like Google \u2014 which last year fired more than two dozen far-left employees who staged a sit-in protest at its New York City office over its cloud-computing contracts with Israel \u2014 could face further disruptions if they are seen as overly critical of Mamdani, who has made anti-Israel remarks.\nBut workplace drama is just one concern at a time when tech firms are spending billions of dollars to lure the best possible talent as they race to develop advanced artificial intelligence and other burgeoning products.\n\u201cTech companies historically do a really great job of, frankly, catering to their employees,\u201d Samuels said. \u201cA lot of tech leaders are not wanting to alienate themselves from their employee base.\u201d\nSome of New York\u2019s tech and business leaders have publicly struck a cautiously optimistic tone about Mamdani\u2019s candidacy. Last month, Partnership for New York City hosted a pair of summits with the Queens assemblyman \u2014 one aimed at executives across various industries and one specifically focused on the outlook for tech.\nWhile the Partnership and Tech:NYC described the latter meeting as \u201clively and productive,\u201d other business leaders have been far less accommodating.\nMamdani\u2019s approach to artificial intelligence is a \u201ckey concern\u201d for Borthwick, who noted that the upstart has yet to articulate a vision on how New York City should leverage a technology that carries major potential but also threatens to cause significant upheaval in the white-collar workforce.\n\u201cThis technology is going to transform the city and he isn\u2019t thinking or ready for it,\u201d said Borthwick, who previously told The Post that a Mamdani mayorship would be \u201cdisastrous for the city.\u201d\nMamdani has vowed to regulate the industry, warning that AI could \u201charm workers, replicate biases, and weaken vital services if done irresponsibly.\u201d\n\u201cWe must ultimately create checks to ensure that technological tools are being deployed responsibly to deliver effective services,\u201d Mamdani told Crain\u2019s New York. \u201cAs mayor, I would work with unions and the City Council to pass legislation to appropriately regulate AI.\u201d\nMamdani has tried to take the edge off his more radical stances \u2014 including publicly backing off his past support for defunding the police.\nAt the same time, he has rankled some executives over his refusal to outwardly condemn the phrase \u201cGlobalize the intifada,\u201d which is widely seen as antisemitic.\nLocal tech leaders are hoping that Mamdani \u2014 or whoever ultimately wins the mayoral race \u2014 will take a more open-minded approach to AI\u2019s potential benefits while also preparing for its risks, according to Samuels.\n\u201cI absolutely would hope that the next mayor would be open to experimentation, would be open to using these modern tools to make New York work better,\u201d said Samuels. \u201cIf our elected officials come in only worrying about the negative first, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever see real change in the way that the city uses technology.\u201d"

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means.

      "text": "- Daniella Pierson became an entrepreneur when she was 19 and nearly failing out of college.\n- She's the founder of The Newsette and Wondermind, a recently launched mental-health platform.\n- Here are the two strategies she's used to build three businesses in less than 10 years.\nDaniella Pierson was 19 when she launched her daily newsletter, The Newsette.\nThe business was an escape for Pierson, who was bored with her college classes and nearly failing out of Boston University, she said.\nEight years later, Pierson's come a long way from her dorm-room dreams of entrepreneurship. Forbes recently dubbed Pierson, 27, the world's youngest, wealthiest self-made woman of color. The Newsette is valued at $200 million and made $40 million in revenue last year, which Insider verified with documentation. Pierson also built a second component to the business, called Newland, a creative-marketing agency. And she launched Wondermind, an eight-month-old company with a mission to \"democratize and destigmatize mental health.\"\nWondermind is already off to a strong start: It was valued at $100 million and raised $5 million in an early-stage round from Serena Ventures, a fund created by the tennis star Serena Williams. Pierson and her cofounders, the producer Mandy Teefey and the musician Selena Gomez, launched the newsletter portion of Wondermind in February and generated seven figures in revenue in four months, documents provided to Insider showed.\nPierson said that to launch Wondermind, she used the same strategies that helped her build her first two businesses: finding mentors and standing out in a crowded market.\nMentorship and connections have fueled ideas\nAfter a few years of expanding her newsletter through word-of-mouth referrals, Pierson started seeing an uptick in media coverage. That exposure got the attention of the fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, who offered to become Pierson's mentor. That relationship has led Pierson to two new business opportunities.\nIn 2020, when Pierson had an idea to highlight the work of diverse female founders on the Amazon homepage, she sought advice from her mentor. Von Furstenberg personally pitched the concept to Amazon's CEO at the time, Jeff Bezos, who accepted, Pierson said.\nThat initiative spurred the creation of Newland, which provides services like website design and social-media content creation for B2B clients. (Pierson declined to share how much of The Newsette's revenue comes from Newland.) Initially, Amazon was the only client, but in the past two years other Fortune 500 companies have become customers, and Pierson is in the process of launching to the public.\nLater, von Furstenberg made another valuable connection for Pierson: She introduced her to Teefey for a feature in The Newsette. Teefey then connected Pierson to Gomez, her daughter. The mother-daughter duo were open about their psychological well-being and were executive producers on the Netflix show \"13 Reasons Why,\" which dealt with suicide and mental illness, Pierson said.\nShe said that hearing Teefey and Gomez speak candidly about their mental-health struggles encouraged her to do the same; she told them she'd been given diagnoses of obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and depression.\n\"I did not think that I would be launching any other business anytime soon,\" Pierson said. But the trio hatched plans to launch Wondermind, leveraging their experiences with mental health, business, and entertainment.\nStanding out in a crowded market through accessible content\nPierson said that as a Hispanic and disabled female founder, she was met with many barriers from the start of her entrepreneurial career. But she'd been inspired by that adversity and aims to make every business she's launched accessible to everyone, she said.\nSince its debut, The Newsette has been a free source of aggregated news that's written conversationally. And Wondermind invites anyone, regardless of their background or familiarity with the subject, to its platform.\nWondermind works with an advisory board of licensed mental health professionals like psychologists and social workers to ensure all content is scientifically accurate and easy for readers to digest and understand, Pierson said. The upcoming production branch aims to develop TV shows and movies addressing mental health and illness.\n\"You don't have to have a mental illness to participate in the Wondermind ecosystem,\" Pierson said, adding that it's \"made to serve the millions of people every single day who Google things like 'What is depression?' or 'How can I improve my mental health?'\""

      "text": "Founder of Rolex luxury watch empire may have been a Nazi spy: report\nSecret British intelligence files have revealed that MI5 once suspected the German-born founder of the iconic Rolex luxury watch empire of holding strong Nazi sympathies and possibly acting as a spy during the Second World War.\nThe declassified records, held at the National Archives, describe Hans Wilsdorf as \u201cmost objectionable\u201d and allege he may have used his position to spread propaganda for Adolf Hitler\u2019s regime, according to the Telegraph.\nThe documents, written between 1941 and 1943 and many stamped with \u201cBox 500\u201d \u2014 a wartime nickname for MI5\u2019s headquarters \u2014 outline fears among British authorities that Wilsdorf posed a security risk despite being a naturalized British citizen.\nBorn in Bavaria in 1881, Wilsdorf moved in 1903 to London, where he began making watches in Hatton Garden and later founded Rolex. He married a British woman, Florence Crotty, before relocating the company\u2019s headquarters to Geneva in 1919.\nBy the early 1940s, British officials had become increasingly wary of Wilsdorf\u2019s loyalties, the Telegraph reported.\nA 1941 report from the British consul in Geneva said he was \u201cwell known for his strong Nazi sympathies,\u201d pointing to claims that his brother, Karl, was working in Joseph Goebbels\u2019 propaganda ministry.\nAccording to the file, Swiss federal police were already monitoring Wilsdorf over concerns he might be involved in spreading Nazi messaging worldwide.\nAn MI5 report from 1943 stated that the agency had been keeping tabs on Rolex\u2019s British operations in Bexleyheath and suspected Wilsdorf of \u201cespionage on behalf of the enemy.\u201d\nThe papers repeatedly described him as \u201cwell known\u201d for his political leanings toward the Nazi regime.\nTom Bolt, a horology specialist who owns a Rolex once sent to a POW in Stalag Luft III, said the newly uncovered documents \u201cshow the level of concern within the British authorities about the company\u2019s founder\u201d and that blacklisting him would have been \u201cseverely damaging for Rolex.\u201d\nRolex has acknowledged knowing about the archive file and says it is taking the allegations seriously.\nA company spokesperson told the Telegraph that an independent review is underway, led by Swiss historian Dr. Marc Perrenoud, who specializes in Switzerland\u2019s role during the Second World War.\nPerrenoud has assembled a committee of historians from multiple countries to assist with the research.\n\u201cIn the interest of transparency, we will publish Dr. Perrenoud\u2019s findings once he has completed his work,\u201d the spokesperson said.\nThe Post has sought comment from Rolex.\nMI5\u2019s World War II era report also questioned the true motive behind one of Wilsdorf\u2019s most celebrated wartime gestures: sending free Rolex watches to British prisoners of war.\nIn 1940, after German officers confiscated timepieces from captured servicemen, Cpl. Clive Nutting \u2014 held at the infamous Stalag Luft III camp in Poland \u2014 wrote to Wilsdorf asking for replacements.\nWilsdorf agreed, telling Nutting he should \u201cnot even think\u201d about paying until after the war. He also sent food parcels and tobacco to some prisoners.\nWhile the gesture boosted Rolex\u2019s public image, British officials at the time speculated whether it was genuine generosity or part of a calculated effort to win favor.\nJose Pereztroika, a historian of watchmaking who discovered the MI5 file and alerted the Telegraph, believes the evidence supports the view that Wilsdorf sympathized with the Nazis.\nWhile the company\u2019s gifts to Allied prisoners could be seen as a sign of solidarity, Pereztroika argued it might also have been \u201ca stunt to gain favor with the British government\u201d at a time when Swiss watch imports to the UK were largely banned.\nHe suggested the move allowed Rolex to cultivate goodwill while positioning itself for postwar business, even if payment for the watches was deferred.\nA 1941 letter from the Ministry of Economic Warfare\u2019s Blacklist Section recommended reviewing whether Wilsdorf should be placed on a trade blacklist, a move that could have crippled Rolex\u2019s overseas sales.\nHowever, the ministry concluded that blacklisting him \u201cmay not be entirely in our interests\u201d because much of the company\u2019s trade was with countries in the British Empire.\nOfficials also noted they had not found direct evidence of harmful activity by the Swiss company. Even so, they noted that Wilsdorf\u2019s financial ties to German bankers could allow enemy interests to influence both the Swiss and British arms of Rolex.\nBy 1943, MI5 decided against blacklisting Wilsdorf, despite maintaining he was \u201cmost objectionable.\u201d\nThe British consul at the time said there was \u201cno doubt whatever\u201d about his political views and voiced skepticism about his aid to prisoners of war, noting that if earlier intelligence was correct, his motives \u201chardly seem likely\u201d to have been purely charitable.\nExperts say the suspicions may also have been fueled by Rolex\u2019s role in supplying dive watches to the Italian navy\u2019s frogmen, an elite unit aligned with the Axis powers."
