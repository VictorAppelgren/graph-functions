  "argos_summary": "The European market has demonstrated resilience, with the STOXX Europe 600 Index rising 2.11% due to strong corporate earnings and geopolitical optimism. Small-cap stocks, particularly Ariston Holding and Vimian Group, are highlighted as potential investment opportunities, with Ariston showing promising growth despite recent volatility and insider buying activity. Vimian, while experiencing declining earnings, has seen revenue growth and is considered undervalued compared to its intrinsic value.",
