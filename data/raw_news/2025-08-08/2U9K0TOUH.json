  "title": "Chelsea 2 Bayer Leverkusen 0 \u2013 Absent Jackson, Estevao\u2019s first goal and a defensive reshuffle",
  "description": "Liam Twomey and Thom Harris break down the main talking points from Chelsea's 2-0 win over Bayer Leverkusen",
  "content": "Chelsea\u2019s return to Stamford Bridge was the tale of an exciting turn from one new face and the complete absence of another.\n\nIn their first pre-season outing since their Club World Cup triumph in the U.S. last month, Enzo Maresca\u2019s side ran out 2-0 winners over Erik ten Hag\u2019s Bayer Leverkusen, with teenager Estevao scoring on his first appearance in Chelsea blue before his Brazilian countryman Joao Pedro rounded things off late on.\n\nBut much of the discourse centred on striker Nicolas Jackson, who was not a part of Maresca\u2019s matchday squad. The Athletic has previously reported in the Transfer DealSheet that Chelsea are open to sanctioning his departure if a suitable offer arrives following their summer captures of Liam Delap and Joao Pedro.\n\nLiam Twomey and Thom Harris break down the main talking points from Chelsea\u2019s comfortable win over German opposition.\n\nThe pre-match conversation was dominated by reports that Nicolas Jackson had asked to be left out of Maresca\u2019s squad to face Leverkusen in order to explore a move elsewhere. It has been very clear all summer that Chelsea have been willing to listen to offers for him, not least because they have bought themselves into a position where the Senegal international looks eminently expendable.\n\nLiam Delap relegated Jackson to second in the pecking order at the FIFA Club World Cup before the 24-year-old\u2019s rash red card against Flamengo provided what might end up being the final punctuation mark on his Chelsea career. Joao Pedro then arrived in time for the knockout stage and seized the starting spot for himself, scoring twice against Fluminense in the semi-final and once against Paris Saint-Germain in the final.\n\nJackson\u2019s absence only intensified the focus on both of them against Leverkusen with the new Premier League season on the horizon. It was interesting to see Maresca start Delap here, and perhaps it is too soon to simply write Joao Pedro\u2019s name in pen at the tip of Chelsea\u2019s strongest XI. Delap\u2019s direct running and endless hustle in the first half stretched the Bundesliga side, creating more space for Cole Palmer and Estevao to express themselves.\n\nBut you can\u2019t deny the level of clinical finishing that Joao Pedro once again showcased with virtually the last kick of the game after coming on as a substitute, sweeping a low shot perfectly into the bottom corner from a central position in the box.\n\nChelsea were crying out for a finisher as ruthless as this last season. Now they appear to have at least one in Joao Pedro and perhaps another in Delap, if he can build upon his encouraging start. It is easy to understand why Jackson might be tempted to look for a new team.\n\nA first look at new signing Hato\n\nFull-back certainly isn\u2019t the most simple role to play for Enzo Maresca\u2019s Chelsea. It\u2019s a physically demanding one too, encapsulated by a tireless Marc Cucurella performance in the first half when the 27-year-old seemed to be everywhere all at once; darting into pockets of space in midfield, charging down the flanks, and dropping into the back line to help his fellow defenders build out from the back.\n\nJorrel Hato didn\u2019t quite match the Cucurella\u2019s first-half dynamism on his Chelsea debut after the break, but the teenager\u2019s mere presence in those midfield positions \u2014 a natural when it comes to stepping into the half-spaces from his left-back role \u2014 made fantastic viewing for those concerned about Cucurella\u2019s 5000-plus minutes last season.\n\nThere were some neat moments from Hato in tight situations, receiving a fizzed pass with his back to goal on the hour mark, turning away from pressure and moving the ball out wide for a Pedro Neto cross. Otherwise, the 19-year-old was constantly on the tails of Tyrique George and Jamie Gittens with driving runs, always providing an option for the quick pass inside. He\u2019s also notably taller than Cucurella and though he wasn\u2019t tested too much with lofted passes in behind him from his full-back role, the Dutchman looks more than capable of holding his own.\n\nHato can play as a wide centre-back too, bringing much needed cover, and more flexibility, to an increasingly fluid side.\n\nEstevao looks right at home alongside talisman Palmer\n\nInside two minutes, Andrey Santos received the ball on the half-turn in midfield, opened up his body and shaped to pass the ball out to the right flank. A very audible buzz of excitement rippled around Stamford Bridge despite the fact that the ball never actually made it to the feet of Estevao.\n\nNothing gets bums off seats in a football ground quite like the sight of a free-flowing Brazilian attacker \u2014 nothing perhaps except a full-blown superstar like Palmer. On this first pre-season outing, Chelsea gave their supporters the decadent treat of watching both of them at the same time. It is already clear they will have a lot of fun together. Their opponents, not so much.\n\nAll of Chelsea\u2019s best sequences in a pleasantly high-intensity first half involved both of them, often in thrilling combination, and the deadlock-breaking goal was no exception. Estevao started it by winning the ball back on the halfway line and picking a quick pass forward. Palmer almost finished it with a brilliantly improvised lob from Cucurella\u2019s cross that crashed back off the crossbar, but Estevao continued his run to drift into the perfect position to sweep in the rebound.\n\nAs he wheeled away in front of a delighted Shed End, slid across the turf on his knees, rose to his feet and kissed the badge before pointing to the sky, it was hard to avoid the conclusion that we are all embarking on what promises to be a very fun ride.\n\nPalmer clearly respects the young Brazilian already. That much was evident in how often he looked for him: once with a back-heel, once with a nonchalant chest pass, and often by barely bringing the ball into his orbit in the middle third before sweeping it out to the right flank without needing to glance up to check if Estevao was open to receive it.\n\nThe young Brazilian was confident and aggressive throughout, never needing a second invitation to shoot from the right in the first half and then, as the No 10 in the second after Palmer was withdrawn, partly to manage minutes and perhaps partly also as a precaution following the heavy kick he took to his ankle from Jarell Quansah.\n\nKeeping both of them fit will be a priority for Maresca because the early indications are that when they share the pitch, good things are much likelier to happen for Chelsea.\n\nWho will replace injured Colwill at the start of the season?\n\nNews of Levi Colwill\u2019s gutting ACL tear cast a shadow over the build-up to this friendly, with the defender looking likely to miss the entirety of the 2025-26 season while he recovers from surgery. The 22-year-old was key to Chelsea\u2019s Club World Cup success in the summer, a valuable left-footed centre-back with excellent distribution from the back, and will have been hoping to work his way into Thomas Tuchel\u2019s plans for the World Cup in the coming months.\n\nChelsea fielded four different centre-backs against Bayer Leverkusen, starting with Josh Acheampong and Trevoh Chalobah in the first half. There was a nervy moment for the former shortly after the only goal, with Acheampong misjudging a bounce and bringing Ibrahim Maza to the ground, but the 19-year-old was largely composed. He stuck to Patrick Schick throughout and played a fantastic zipped pass into Palmer to kickstart an attack on the half-hour mark, leading to a chance for the lively Estevao.\n\nChalobah was the man to take up Colwill\u2019s wider role in build-up, however, and dealt with the visitors\u2019 threat out wide with minimal fuss. It suggests that he could be the man to start in Chelsea\u2019s Premier League opener against Crystal Palace, ahead of the likes of Benoit Badiashile and Wesley Fofana, both nursing long-term injuries. But with Hato underway in Chelsea colours, and three weeks of a very busy transfer window to go, watch this space.\n\nWhat next for Chelsea?",

      "text": "Enzo Maresca has refused to rule out the possibility of Nicolas Jackson leaving Chelsea this month, as uncertainty continues to swirl around the striker\u2019s future at Stamford Bridge.\nAs detailed in The Athletic\u2019s Transfer DealSheet this week, Chelsea are not desperate to sell the 24-year-old this summer, but recognise that he may want to go elsewhere to be a lead striker and are open to sanctioning his departure if a suitable offer arrives.\nAdvertisement\nChelsea\u2019s summer acquisitions Joao Pedro and Liam Delap both appear to be ahead of Jackson in the No 9 pecking order, while Newcastle are still in the market for a new striker with Manchester United emerging as RB Leipzig star Benjamin Sesko\u2019s preferred destination.\n\u201cNico is ok,\u201d Maresca said in a press conference on Thursday when asked how Jackson is dealing with the speculation. \u201cWhen the transfer window is open, unfortunately or fortunately, anything can happen. This also involves Nico\u2019s situation. Two other strikers arrived, both of them were in the USA, Joao and Liam, so we will see what happens.\u201d\nAt the other end of the pitch, Maresca revealed that defender Levi Colwill picked up an injury in Chelsea\u2019s first pre-season training session and does not know how long he will be sidelined. The 22-year-old was absent from Wednesday\u2019s trophy celebration at Stamford Bridge and there are fears his issue could be significant.\n\u201cWe had a problem the last two days with Levi Colwill,\u201d Maresca added. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long he\u2019s going to be out. It was the first session on Monday and just in the last minutes of the session he felt something and we need to wait.\n\u201cWe know each other from last year and we know how important he has been. I spoke with Levi yesterday and I told him if we achieve what we achieved last year, it\u2019s also because of him.\u201d\nChelsea face Bayer Leverkusen in a pre-season friendly at Stamford Bridge on Friday.\n(Photo: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Chelsea defender Levi Colwill faces a long spell on the sidelines after undergoing surgery to repair a torn ACL suffered in training at Cobham on Monday.\nColwill, 22, suffered the injury towards the end of Chelsea\u2019s first training session after re-convening at Cobham ahead of the new Premier League season, and was notably absent from Wednesday\u2019s trophy celebration with several thousand supporters at Stamford Bridge.\nAdvertisement\nMaresca hinted that the injury was serious with his comments about Colwill in a press conference to preview Chelsea\u2019s first pre-season friendly against Bayer Leverkusen.\n\u201cWe had a problem the last two days with Levi Colwill,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s head coach said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how long he\u2019s going to be out.

      "text": "Welcome to the 10th edition of The Athletic\u2019s Transfer DealSheet for the summer 2025 transfer window.\nOur team of dedicated writers, including David Ornstein, will take you inside the market to explain the deals being worked on. The transfer window is open and will run until September 1.\nThe information found within this article has been gathered according to The Athletic\u2019s sourcing guidelines. Unless stated, our reporters have spoken to more than one person briefed on each deal before offering the clubs involved the opportunity to comment. Their responses, when they were given, have been included.\nAdvertisement\nWe aim to bring you analysis you can trust about what is happening at Europe\u2019s leading clubs and the latest information we\u2019re hearing from across the market. This year, The Athletic\u2019s football finance writer, Chris Weatherspoon, will be adding to our analysis of the transfer market.\nLast week, we looked at Liverpool\u2019s financial position, a possible new contract for a Chelsea target, and Manchester United\u2019s striker options. This week, we look at the striker high among the options left on the market, a possible deal for an Arsenal midfielder, and the latest on Benjamin Sesko.\nThis article is long but detailed, so enjoy it all \u2014 or search for the club or player you want to read about.\nDavid Ornstein\u2019s One To Watch\nAs the striker jigsaw continues to form, the football world is watching closely to discover how the various pieces will eventually fall into place.\nThe likes of Liam Delap and Viktor Gyokeres have made their moves, but the futures of players such as Alexander Isak and Benjamin Sesko are yet to be resolved.\nOn Monday night, The Athletic revealed that Newcastle United have increased their offer for Sesko as they battle Manchester United to secure the 22-year-old.\nWhoever misses out will need to find an alternative recruit \u2014 unless they stick with existing personnel \u2014 and there is not a huge array of candidates on the market.\nWhether it is for those two clubs or others also looking to strengthen up front, that will naturally increase the consideration given to the market\u2019s remaining options.\nHigh among them is Chelsea forward Nicolas Jackson, owing to his suitability and availability.\nThe Stamford Bridge side are not desperate to trade the 24-year-old, especially given they require depth ahead of contesting Champions League football next season.\nBut the arrival of Delap and Joao Pedro provides competition and puts Jackson at risk of not being the primary forward, and after scoring 30 goals across 81 games in west London, he will want to be the main man somewhere.\nAdvertisement\nThat explains why Chelsea are open to sanctioning the Senegal international\u2019s departure if an acceptable proposal arrives.\nInterest stems from suitors in both the Premier League and Europe. Some of them want Jackson only if their key target cannot be obtained, or someone leaves; others in addition to what they already have.\nEither way, there is a growing expectation that he will exit, and developments on that case are anticipated in the coming days.\nIt would continue a remarkable sequence of sales completed or agreed by Chelsea, which means they will have accumulated more than \u00a3200million ($265m) in the current transfer window. They are forecasting another \u00a3100m to \u00a3150m before the deadline.\nWhy top clubs would benefit from signing Jackson\nIn an increasingly transitional league, Nicolas Jackson\u2019s devastating ability on the break is a highly sought-after resource. Last season saw a seven-year high of 112 Premier League goals scored from counter-attacks, and few players were as central to those moves as Jackson.\nHis ability to collect the ball in deep areas and surge up the pitch sets him apart. According to advanced data provider Footovision, he led the division for counter-attacking involvements via ball carries.\nJackson is electric in transition, but his finishing and final-third choices remain raw. Yet few strikers possess the relentless desire and movement to reach those advanced areas in the first place: Jackson made 60 sprints in behind the defence \u2014 defined by SkillCorner as off-ball runs of at least 25km/h \u2014 nine more than any other Premier League player.\nJackson specialises in specific traits that make him an appealing profile for a host of Premier League clubs. And for all the noise around his performances, it\u2019s easy to forget that Jackson has hit double figures for league goals in both of his two seasons at Stamford Bridge.\nConor O\u2019Neill\nWhat else we\u2019re hearing\n- RB Leipzig have received an improved offer from Newcastle United to sign Benjamin Sesko. An opening bid worth \u20ac75million (\u00a365m; $87m) plus \u20ac5million in add-ons was deemed insufficient by Leipzig, leading Newcastle to raise that to at least \u20ac80m. Sesko is also wanted by Manchester United, but a proposal has yet to arrive from Old Trafford and the figures they have indicated a willingness to pay are lower than those of Newcastle at present. That leaves the St James\u2019 Park side in a strong position as things stand, after a day of positive talks held by their co-owner Jamie Reuben with Leipzig and the 22-year-old striker. Nothing is agreed yet and there is currently no guarantee of the outcome, which could still be Sesko staying if Leipzig do not accept a deal. David Ornstein\n- Burnley are set to strengthen in midfield ahead of their return to the Premier League after reaching an agreement with Chelsea to sign Lesley Ugochukwu. The France youth international, 21, has been granted permission to travel for medical tests and complete a permanent move to Turf Moor. If all goes to plan, Ugochukwu will put pen to paper on a five-year contract \u2014 significantly boosting head coach Scott Parker\u2019s options in the No 6 and No 8 roles. David Ornstein\n- Manchester City have reached an agreement in principle with Ruben Dias to sign a new contract. The 28-year-old\u2019s existing deal expires in 2027. Dias has been a major part of City\u2019s success since he joined from Benfica for an initial \u00a362m in 2020. David Ornstein\n- Stuttgart are working on a deal to sign attacking midfielder Fabio Vieira from Arsenal. The German club have approached their Premier League counterparts about Vieira. The 25-year-old was loaned to Porto last season, but Stuttgart\u2019s interest is in a permanent move. An agreement has yet to be reached, but talks are ongoing, with Arsenal likely to seek a respectable price for a player they recruited for up to \u20ac40m in the summer of 2022. David Ornstein\n- Borussia Dortmund remain interested in securing the permanent transfer of Chelsea\u2019s Carney Chukwuemeka, who spent last season on loan at the Westfalenstadion. Chelsea have no interest in loaning Chukwuemeka out again and would only consider a permanent deal for the 21-year-old. Sebastian Stafford-Bloor and Simon Johnson\n- Botafogo have reached an agreement with Bournemouth to sign Neto. The 36-year-old Brazilian goalkeeper was scheduled to fly to Rio de Janeiro on Monday night and undergo a medical before completing the proposed move. It will not involve a transfer fee, but as one of Bournemouth\u2019s highest earners, the Premier League club will make significant salary savings. Neto\u2019s contract was due to end next June, and he is set to join Botafogo on a deal until the summer of 2027, with an option to extend by six months. Bournemouth have already signed Djordje Petrovic from Chelsea as their new No 1, while Neto spent last season on loan with Arsenal. David Ornstein\n- Everton are in talks with Chelsea over the permanent transfer of Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall for an initial fee of \u00a325m. As reported by The Athletic last week, Chelsea will only consider a permanent sale and placed a valuation of \u00a330m \u2014 the fee they paid Leicester City last year \u2014 on the midfielder, while other Premier League clubs have also made enquiries. Patrick Boyland and Simon Johnson\nWho has spent the most in the Premier League so far this window?\nA look at Premier League spending by club so far this summer throws up few surprises at the top end. Using figures sourced from Transfermarkt, Liverpool\u2019s big summer puts them top of the tree with over \u00a3250m spent on new players; add in \u00a325m on Giorgi Mamardashvili (deal agreed last summer, but only joined Liverpool officially this season) and expectations of agent fees and the four per cent transfer levy payable by clubs on incoming transfers and you land beyond \u00a3300m.\nAdvertisement\nBehind Liverpool sit Chelsea, again offering little surprise. Indeed, of the seven clubs to have spent over \u00a3100m to date, all but one form part of England\u2019s \u2018Big Six\u2019. The exception, Sunderland, have spent heavily as a result of past prudence and out of necessity as a newly promoted club. They are expected to spend even more before the season commences.\nOf greater note are those clubs that haven\u2019t spent much yet. Between Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and Fulham, less than \u00a310m has been laid out on new players, which looks pretty stark when set against the backdrop of the rest of the division\u2019s spending.\nPremier League clubs have spent over \u00a31.8billion on players so far this summer, though plenty of that has been among themselves, with the division\u2019s net spend standing at around \u00a3865m.\nEven so, Premier League spending continues to dominate the world transfer market. That net spend figure is far and away the most in football this summer, with only the Saudi Pro League also reaching nine figures (\u00a3185m). The Saudi league\u2019s gross spend is just \u00a3280m so far, though there are expectations that will soon rise.\nChris Weatherspoon\nArsenal\nWhat happened this week?\nAfter a flurry of activity, it has been a quieter week at Arsenal.\nArsenal\u2019s recruitment drive continues at academy level, although the club missed out on 17-year-old Salford City striker Will Wright. Despite agreeing on a fee of \u00a3200,000 plus add-ons with Salford, Arsenal never reached an agreement on personal terms with the player. Wright preferred to remain in the north west, and that allowed Liverpool to steal in and secure a deal.\nThe club are still looking for a striker to complement Andre Harriman-Annous, who toured with the first team in Asia, at under-21 level. Arsenal have had a second bid rejected for 17-year-old Blackburn Rovers striker Igor Tyjon.\nThey have managed to secure the signing of 16-year-old goalkeeper Remi Lupinski from MK Dons. Lupinski, who will be part of Arsenal\u2019s under-17s next season, has signed a two-year scholarship deal.\nWhich youngsters impressing in pre-season could fill gaps in the squad?\nLast summer, the performances of Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri in pre-season forced them into first-team contention. Arsenal adapted their transfer plans accordingly, loaning out Vieira to provide Nwaneri with opportunities to develop.\nThis year, it\u2019s 15-year-old Max Dowman who has captured the imagination with a series of impressive cameos. It is unclear how regularly he will be involved with the first team once the competitive season starts.\nAdvertisement\nThus far, left-footed Dowman has featured on the right wing. That\u2019s a position where Arsenal have more experienced alternatives. Bukayo Saka is one of the first names on the team sheet and Arsenal have also welcomed Noni Madueke to Colney in recent days. Madueke cut short his holiday to start training with Arsenal ahead of schedule.\nThe 2025-26 season is the first campaign in which Dowman will be eligible for either the Arsenal first-team or their under-21s. It is expected he will feature for both teams across the course of the campaign.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nIf Arsenal are to make a significant addition to the first-team squad, it is most likely to be on the left wing. Any acquisition may be connected to the futures of Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard.\nArsenal hold a long-term interest in 19-year-old Rennes defender Jeremy Jacquet. The France Under-21 international was discussed as a potential signing before Arsenal moved ahead with a deal for Cristhian Mosquera.\nDepartures of defenders such as Oleksandr Zinchenko or Jakub Kiwior could lead Arsenal to revisit their interest, but Jacquet signed a new deal with Rennes as recently as May, tying him to the Ligue 1 club until 2029.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nKiwior has been the subject of interest from Porto.\nThe Polish international defender enjoys life at Arsenal, but at 25, he is interested in exploring opportunities to join clubs where he would be regarded as a first-choice player.\nArsenal are not in a hurry to move Kiwior on, but as with most players, there is a number at which a deal would make sense for all parties.\nA number of other players on the fringes of the first-team squad could be allowed to leave before the transfer deadline. There is interest from Fulham in Reiss Nelson.\nAdvertisement\nArsenal also hope to find buyers for Zinchenko, Albert Sambi Lokonga, and Karl Hein. Vieira is being targeted by Stuttgart. The 25-year-old was loaned to Porto last season, but Stuttgart\u2019s interest is in a permanent move. An agreement has yet to be reached, but talks are ongoing.\nA number of academy players may also be permitted to leave permanently if a suitable opportunity arises.\nJames McNicholas\nChelsea\nWhat happened this week?\nIt has been a busy one. As far as incomings go, Chelsea completed the purchase of Netherlands international defender Jorrel Hato for a fee in excess of \u20ac40m. They also won the race to sign highly rated England Under-19 midfielder Jesse Derry, who chose to run his contract down at Crystal Palace.\nMore work has been done on the departures front. Joao Felix joined Al Nassr as expected for an initial \u20ac30m, with add-ons potentially taking it to \u20ac50m.\nBurnley have beaten off competition from teams across Europe to buy midfielder Ugochukwu. They also agreed a fee with Chelsea for striker Armando Broja. As reported in the transfer DealSheet last week, Chelsea\u2019s asking price was \u00a325m. The final sum is unlikely to be made public.\nEverton are in talks over the signing of midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall for an initial fee of \u00a325m, and discussions are ongoing. There is also interest from other Premier League clubs. The transfer DealSheet revealed last week that several Premier League teams had made an enquiry and that Chelsea\u2019s asking price is around \u00a330m.\nSunderland are close to finalising a season-long loan for striker Marc Guiu. The negotiation has included inserting a clause akin to Broja\u2019s loan to Fulham last year, where a penalty fee will have to be paid if the forward does not play a certain number of games. Sunderland sources are comfortable with the situation and do not see such a clause being problematic.\nAdvertisement\nThere has been a lot of activity with sister club Strasbourg, too. Midfielder Kendry Paez and goalkeeper Mike Penders joined them on a season-long loan, while under-21 defender Ishe Samuels-Smith moved permanently for an undisclosed fee.\nMeanwhile, under-21 midfielder Leo Castledine left on loan for Huddersfield Town and another talented member of the development squad, Alex Matos, is nearing a permanent departure.\nDo Chelsea have what they need to compete on four fronts?\nChelsea believe they have improved the squad from the one that finished fourth in the Premier League and won the Conference League.\nThe two wingers that have left \u2014 Jadon Sancho and Noni Madueke \u2014 have already been replaced by Jamie Gittens and Estevao Willian. The attack has been strengthened, too, with the arrivals of Liam Delap (Ipswich Town) and Joao Pedro (Brighton & Hove Albion), plus extra midfield cover has been provided with the additions of Dario Essugo (Sporting CP) and Andrey Santos, who has returned from Strasbourg on loan.\nHato\u2019s purchase has also filled in a major gap in the group, as Marc Cucurella finally has cover from someone who actually naturally plays in the position rather than switching right-backs Malo Gusto or Reece James across.\nMore departures are expected, particularly higher up the pitch, and that will leave space for more arrivals to come.\nThe only area they will not add to, which will come under scrutiny from the fan base, is in goal. They have no intention to buy another goalkeeper now, despite pursuing Mike Maignan earlier in the window. Chelsea are happy with Robert Sanchez and Filip Jorgensen as their two main choices. Indeed, they turned down an offer from a Champions League club for the latter.\nIn terms of the overall picture, head coach Enzo Maresca will have the opportunity to rotate due to the amount of options at his disposal.\nAdvertisement\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nThe primary areas are another winger and a creative player, which is why the names Alejandro Garnacho and Xavi Simons will not go away. Both players depend on exits. Chelsea are in informal discussions with Manchester United over Garnacho, but that is as far as it has gone.\nThe same can be said for Simons. No formal bid has been made to RB Leipzig yet. Chelsea do have other players on their wishlist for these roles, including Aston Villa\u2019s Morgan Rogers.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nAs my colleague David Ornstein reports, Chelsea are not desperate to sell Nicolas Jackson but would be open to sanctioning his departure if the right proposal arrives.\nThe transfer DealSheet revealed last month that Chelsea are open to loaning out winger Tyrique George, but the situation has developed since then.\nChelsea are talking with George\u2019s representatives to figure out the best option going forward. A straight loan is still a possibility, but Chelsea will not consider any proposals including an option to buy. Like Guiu, the club want some kind of conditions in place regarding playing time if there is a loan.\nA permanent sale is being discussed, too, but Chelsea would like to include a buy-back clause and a sell-on fee. A number of teams in England and Europe have registered their interest in both scenarios.\nChristopher Nkunku, who is valued at \u20ac50m, has been given permission to miss the start of pre-season training. He is the subject of enquiries from a number of clubs in England, Italy and Germany. Two teams that looked like possible candidates to sign him earlier in the window \u2014 Manchester United and RB Leipzig \u2014 are now deemed unlikely.\nJackson is the subject of approaches from multiple clubs in England and Europe, too. Chelsea do not see him as untouchable, but will demand a high fee similar to what other starting centre-forwards have cost when transferred to other clubs this summer.\nAdvertisement\nChelsea are still working on the sales of Raheem Sterling, Ben Chilwell, Renato Veiga, Carney Chukwuemeka, who is of interest to Borussia Dortmund, and Axel Disasi. They want to get their situations resolved before entering the final week.\nAlfie Gilchrist is still hopeful of joining a Championship side, but he may have to wait until the end of the month. Defender Aaron Anselmino is highly rated at Chelsea after integrating into the camp during the second half of last season and will be sent on loan. Teams in Europe have made an enquiry.\nSimon Johnson\nLiverpool\nWhat happened this week?\nLiverpool\u2019s pursuit of Alexander Isak continued, but there were no signs of a breakthrough.\nA \u00a3110m bid for the Sweden striker was rejected by Newcastle United, who value their prized asset close to \u00a3150m and will not consider selling unless an offer is too good to turn down and they source a suitable replacement.\nMeanwhile, after Luis Diaz completed his move to Bayern Munich, another Liverpool forward edged closer towards an exit as Saudi Pro League side Al Hilal identified Darwin Nunez as their priority target. Milan have also shown an interest in the Uruguayan, although it\u2019s unlikely they will be able to afford him as the cost of the total package is deemed too expensive.\nOn the pitch, Arne Slot\u2019s side wrapped up their pre-season friendly schedule with a double-header against Athletic Club on Monday night at Anfield.\nIs it Isak or bust up front?\nSlot has consistently reiterated that he is only looking for players who can immediately improve the squad, and clearly Isak fits the bill.\nLanding the 25-year-old striker would supercharge an attack that won the title last season and also boost the options ahead of further expected outgoings.\nYet there\u2019s no intention to stockpile players for the sake of it should a move for Isak not progress. Liverpool have new signings Hugo Ekitike and Florian Wirtz alongside Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah already in the attacking department, while Jeremie Frimpong is an attack-minded right-sided player. There\u2019s no intention to block Rio Ngumoha\u2019s pathway, either, so it would take a standout market opportunity for Liverpool to consider a different attacking option.\nAdvertisement\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nCentre-back is an area that remains a little light following Jarell Quansah\u2019s exit to Bayer Leverkusen.\nIdeally, Slot would like another defender so he has strong competition for places, and a number of young players have been considered.\nThe alternative is turning to either Ryan Gravenberch or Wataru Endo to fill in if Virgil van Dijk, Ibrahima Konate, or Joe Gomez are not available.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nTyler Morton is on the verge of moving to Lyon for a fee of \u00a315m, inclusive of add-ons.\nFederico Chiesa is still weighing up his options ahead of a likely exit this month, while Kostas Tsimikas debates his future with two years remaining on his contract.\nA number of clubs have shown interest in Ben Doak, but Liverpool are waiting for any offers to sign the winger on a permanent deal before deciding what happens next. James McConnell and Luca Stephenson are expected to go out on loan, but there is growing interest in both players from clubs who are considering a permanent move.\nGregg Evans\nManchester City\nWhat happened this week?\nGoalkeeper James Trafford officially rejoined from Burnley, two years after leaving. City sold him for \u00a314m and bought him back for \u00a327m, which means the value of the deal in book value is \u00a313m.\nLeaving the club on loan was 19-year-old winger Joel Ndala, who joined Hull City. He spent a year at PSV Jong (their second-tier side) and the last four months of last season at Nottingham Forest, which he mainly spent with their Premier League 2 side. They did not take up the option to sign him permanently.\nAre we getting to the stage where City might cut any of their unwanted players loose?\nNumbers certainly have to come down now, with less than a month remaining of the window. They have yet to make headway on that, though, with Jack Grealish, Kalvin Phillips and James McAtee all still City players.\nOther possible departures are being narrowed down as players commit to staying. John Stones is not leaving in the final year of his deal, while the plan is for Abdukodir Khusanov to stay.\nAdvertisement\nThe Uzbek defender\u2019s first six months have been seen as a period to adjust to a new culture, league and language. The fact he can operate at right-back as well as centre-back is also useful.\nThere could be several players heading out on loan, though.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nTrafford represented the final bit of proactive business in terms of incomings.\nThe priority is now sorting the futures of the players who are surplus to requirements, unless an opportunity arises in a position that improves the team and adds value.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nClaudio Echeverri\u2019s future is still to be decided as he is highly thought of internally, but a spot in Argentina\u2019s World Cup squad next summer is on his mind.\nHe has yet to be capped by the senior team, but sources close to the player believe that a loan move is needed to ensure he plays enough. A move to fellow City Football Group club Girona is not on the cards, with the preference being a loan to a Premier League side, if he does leave.\nBrazilian defender Vitor Reis is also in discussions about leaving on loan for the season, potentially to Girona, with his international ambitions also playing a part.\nElsewhere, many European clubs have registered interest in acquiring Sverre Nypan on loan. Bundesliga clubs are in the race, but conversations are ongoing to identify the best destination for his development.\nAt the top end of the academy, Watford and Swansea City are battling for the signature of defender Max Alleyne, who is in talks to extend his contract before heading out on his first loan. Several European clubs have also shown interest.\nJordan Campbell\nManchester United\nWhat happened this week?\nUnited\u2019s summer-long striker search narrowed to a single, priority target: RB Leipzig\u2019s Benjamin Sesko.\nInformal club-to-club talks have taken place with Leipzig, as have discussions with Sesko\u2019s representatives over prospective personal terms. Competition from Newcastle United is fierce \u2014 they made an improved offer for the striker on Monday night. An opening bid worth \u20ac75m plus \u20ac5million in add-ons was deemed insufficient by Leipzig, leading Newcastle to raise that to at least \u20ac80m.\nAdvertisement\nChristopher Vivell, United\u2019s director of recruitment, served in the same role at Red Bull Salzburg when Sesko joined from Slovenian club Domzale in 2019 and has been a driving force behind United\u2019s pursuit. But a proposal has yet to arrive from Old Trafford and as The Athletic\u2019s David Ornstein reports, the figures they have indicated a willingness to pay are presently lower than those of Newcastle.\nOmar Berrada, United\u2019s chief executive, told MUTV before Sunday\u2019s 2-2 draw with Everton in the United States that a recruitment team, including Vivell, is \u201cworking around the clock\u201d back in Manchester to further strengthen the squad.\n\u201cWe have to do a lot of multitasking,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been lots of late calls and early morning meetings to make sure we stay on top of it.\u201d\nElsewhere, academy players Ethan Wheatley and Jack Moorhouse both secured loans to League One clubs, joining Northampton Town and Leyton Orient respectively until the end of the season.\nUnited have narrowed their search to a single priority striker: Sesko (Maja Hitij/Getty Images)\nWhy did Man Utd decide on Sesko as their first choice?\nUnited had previously whittled their striker shortlist down to Sesko and Aston Villa\u2019s Ollie Watkins, who would offer valuable Premier League experience, such as new arrivals Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha.\nSesko is a rawer and riskier alternative to Watkins, but also far from an unknown quantity in the corridors of Carrington and Old Trafford. United previously explored a move for him when he was just 16 years old, before he had left his native Slovenia.\nUnited revived their interest during Erik ten Hag\u2019s first summer in charge, but Sesko committed to swapping Red Bull Salzburg for their stablemates in Leipzig. He was a target early last summer, too, before attention turned to Joshua Zirkzee.\nAdvertisement\nSesko\u2019s record in the Bundesliga of 27 goals in 64 appearances over the past two seasons is solid without being spectacular and raises questions over whether he is capable of making an immediate impact.\nBut at 22, he is significantly younger than the 29-year-old Watkins, and his rare blend of speed and stature with a powerful strike has made him one of the most highly rated young centre-forwards in Europe.\nSpending north of \u20ac80m on Sesko\u2019s potential would represent a gamble, but should he realise that potential, United would have a striker capable of leading the line for years to come.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nOther than up front, United have been assessing their options in midfield. Amorim is keen to add more dynamism in the middle of the park.\nA goalkeeper signing has also been considered, although with Andre Onana expected to stay, any further addition will likely depend on whether understudy Altay Bayindir departs in search of regular minutes.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nThe Sesko pursuit brings Rasmus Hojlund\u2019s future into question, despite him making no secret of his desire to stay and fight for his place.\nWhile there is interest in the 22-year-old, United will almost certainly need to swallow a loss on his book value of around \u00a340m to let him go. Offers of \u00a330m will be considered.\nGarnacho is the subject of interest from Chelsea, and Real Betis hope to sign Antony on a permanent basis after his successful loan spell in La Liga last season, but neither move is advanced.\nUnited are also eager to offload Sancho, are open to offers for Tyrell Malacia, and could allow Toby Collyer to leave on loan.\nMark Critchley\nNewcastle United\nWhat happened this week?\nBlimey, where to begin?\nThey finally received \u2014 and rebuffed \u2014 an offer for Isak, with Liverpool\u2019s formal bid of \u00a3110m some \u00a310m less than their unofficial expression of interest last month and a great deal less than Newcastle\u2019s \u00a3150m valuation. Isak, who has not been on the club\u2019s pre-season tour to East Asia, instead trained alone at Real Sociedad, his former club, before returning to Newcastle\u2019s training ground on Monday.\nAfter suffering a series of high-profile rejections this summer, Newcastle identified Sesko as their leading target to replace Isak or, \u201cin an ideal world\u201d, play alongside him.\nThey followed that up with a bid worth \u20ac80m to RB Leipzig, but that fell short of the German club\u2019s demands. Newcastle are working flat-out on Sesko, with Jamie Reuben, one of the club\u2019s co-owners, taking a personal interest and being heavily involved, but they are aware they are competing for Sesko with Manchester United.\nAdvertisement\nOn Monday, Newcastle made an improved offer. This leaves them in a strong position as things stand, following a day of positive talks held by Reuben with Leipzig and the striker.\nTheir pursuit of Brentford\u2019s Yoane Wissa is ongoing.\nThey completed their second senior signing of the window with goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale joining from Southampton on a season-long loan with an option to buy at the end of the season.\nThe 18-year-old winger, Antonio Cordero, newly arrived from Malaga, left for Westerlo in Belgium on a season-long loan, while midfielder Isaac Hayden was released from his contract.\nIs the slow-moving nature of Newcastle\u2019s business becoming a problem?\nThe slow-moving nature of everything Newcastle do (or don\u2019t do) is a concern. Almost 11 months after Darren Eales announced he would be stepping down as chief executive after a diagnosis of blood cancer, the club have still not confirmed his replacement, with Eales now on medical leave. Nor do they have a sporting director after Paul Mitchell saw out his notice and left at the end of June.\nBoth of these things, to put it mildly, are sub-optimal. It means, for the second summer in succession, there is a huge flux at the top of the club.\nIn terms of the bigger picture, there has been no tangible movement on a new stadium or training ground; while these are huge, complex projects, it has become difficult for Howe to point to progress in other areas of the club.\nRewind to the end of last season, when Newcastle sealed qualification for the Champions League and Howe said: \u201cWe have to be ready to conclude things very quickly because good players don\u2019t hang around for long.\u201d\nThat, clearly, did not happen. Was this a failure of preparation, which should have taken place on Mitchell\u2019s watch? Was it because Howe wanted, where possible, oven-ready Premier League players? Was it a combination of both, plus less-than-perfect circumstances?\nAdvertisement\nWhatever the case, the likes of Bryan Mbeumo, Liam Delap, Joao Pedro, James Trafford, and Hugo Ekitike have all ended up moving to traditional \u2018Big Six\u2019 clubs.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nFor obvious reasons, centre-forward towers above everything else. With Callum Wilson leaving Newcastle at the end of last season and subsequently joining West Ham United, some form of backup for Isak was already required.\nThere has been a glimpse of what life without Isak would look like during pre-season fixtures. William Osula, the only established centre-forward available to Howe, started three matches in succession; the Denmark Under-21 International is yet to start once in the Premier League. Against Tottenham Hotspur, Anthony Gordon began up front. Neither is a long-term solution.\nRight-sided centre-half is another longstanding requirement. Mitchell spent weeks attempting to sign Crystal Palace\u2019s Marc Guehi a year ago, and he remains of interest, but is Newcastle still of interest to the England defender? Atalanta\u2019s Giorgio Scalvini and Marseille\u2019s Leonardo Balerdi have featured during transfer discussions, but other European-based players are under active consideration.\nHaving sold Sean Longstaff to Leeds United, Howe\u2019s options in midfield are thinner, particularly with Joe Willock now out for between four and six weeks with a calf injury. Ideally, there would be reinforcements here, too, although little has been ideal about this summer.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nAll roads lead back to Isak.\nNewcastle have been careful to leave escape routes open for their most important player. There has been no criticism of him in public, although there were some pointed general remarks from Howe on Sunday when he told reporters: \u201cNo player can expect to act poorly and train with the group as normal.\u201d They still believe he can be reintegrated, but this will, in part, be determined by the player\u2019s attitude, as well as Liverpool, whose interest remains.\nAdvertisement\nAs Isak\u2019s situation shows, Newcastle cannot take anything for granted, but they are determined to hold on to their other prize assets, Sandro Tonali, Bruno Guimaraes, Gordon and Tino Livramento.\nBeyond that, Burnley are talking to the club about signing Martin Dubravka, the goalkeeper, while Odysseas Vlachodimos, another goalkeeper, is also available, most likely for a loan.\nNewcastle would not stand in the way of full-backs Matt Targett or Harrison Ashby leaving.\nWhich Premier League clubs could do with selling players this window?\nThere are four weeks remaining in this summer\u2019s transfer window and, though eyes will inevitably be drawn to incomings, it\u2019s a natural byproduct of modern football \u2014 profit and sustainability rules (PSR), cash flow, and squad sizes \u2014 that some clubs will be in greater need of selling than others.\nChelsea provide perhaps the most obvious example, their settlement agreement with UEFA last month dictating that to register new players to their Champions League squad list, they need to ensure a \u2018positive transfer balance\u2019. In other words, outgoings need to outweigh the cost of those newly registered players.\nIn truth, Chelsea\u2019s business model has long relied on player trading and they\u2019ve been effective sellers for years. Their need to sell is not a sign of desperation, more a fact of Stamford Bridge life.\nAs reported by David Ornstein, Jackson\u2019s exit could represent another big sale for Chelsea.\nManchester United might not be desperate, but their desire to sell players this summer is heightened, not least because they\u2019ve been such poor sellers in the past. Already this window, they have benefited from significant sell-on fees via moves involving Alvaro Carreras, Anthony Elanga and Maxi Oyedele.\nUnited haven\u2019t sold anyone themselves yet, though the savings on Marcus Rashford\u2019s wages for a year are sizeable. United\u2019s financial concerns are more cash-focused than based on any ongoing PSR worries, as they owed significant transfer instalments even before the signings of Cunha and Mbeumo. Outgoings, with Garnacho and Antony the prime candidates, might not be financial necessities, but United need to get better at selling, and there\u2019s no time better than the present.\nAdvertisement\nElsewhere, several clubs have already been active sellers of talent. Bournemouth, Brighton and Nottingham Forest have each banked over \u00a3100m in sales this summer. Wolves and Brentford aren\u2019t far behind. West Ham\u2019s sale of Mohammed Kudus pretty much offsets their spending on new faces.\nArsenal are the Premier League\u2019s highest spenders on a net basis currently, committing around \u00a3200m in fees while only recouping small sums on Nuno Tavares and Marquinhos. They had a lean year in terms of transfer spending last season, giving them scope to splurge this time around, but it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise if they sought some sales this month.\nLikewise Liverpool. The Athletic has detailed how they can afford their big spending, but the desire to land Isak looks a stretch without a departure, if only because of Fenway Sports Group\u2019s continued desire to run the club sustainably. Nunez leaving would have the benefit of freeing up a striker spot and, most likely, generating a decent fee.\nChris Weatherspoon\nTottenham Hotspur\nWhat happened this week?\nThe biggest story was Son Heung-min playing his last game for Tottenham Hotspur after 10 glorious years. Negotiations are currently ongoing for a move to LAFC, and Son played 66 minutes of the friendly against Newcastle before he was taken off to huge applause.\nIt remains to be seen when Son\u2019s move to LA will be confirmed, and whether Spurs will be straight into the market for a replacement. But the other major development from Sunday was James Maddison being taken off on a stretcher with a worrying-looking knee injury. If it was as serious as it looked, then Spurs may have an issue with creativity in the middle of the pitch.\nThey did make another midfield addition on Sunday, though, with Portugal international Joao Palhinha joining from Bayern Munich on loan. Meanwhile, Mikey Moore joined Rangers on a season\u2019s loan.\nDoes Palhinha solve an issue in the middle?\nMost definitely. Tottenham have lacked a solid defensive midfielder for years. Last season they had to make do with Rodrigo Bentancur and Yves Bissouma in that position, with a few occasional contributions from Archie Gray. And they never looked secure.\nThe decision to allow Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg to go to Marseille last summer, while understandable, left Tottenham short in that role. Too many times last year, opponents just counter-attacked through the middle of the pitch, or easily got a shot off from the edge of the box.\nIt is no surprise that Thomas Frank wanted to change that. The former Brentford head coach wanted to bring Christian Norgaard in from his former club, but he chose Arsenal. Frank will hope Palhinha will do the job. He had two good years at Fulham where he comfortably led the Premier League in tackles, proving that he was one of the best players around at stealing the ball and breaking up opposition attacks. And even though he struggled to make much of an impact at Bayern, he should be perfectly equipped to deliver some much-needed defensive stability at the base of Spurs\u2019 midfield.\nAdvertisement\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nThe big question for Spurs is whether Maddison\u2019s knee injury forces them back into the market to add some creative quality before the end of the window. They pushed hard to sign Morgan Gibbs-White from Nottingham Forest earlier in the window for \u00a360m. But with Gibbs-White staying at Forest, and Maddison and Dejan Kulusevski both down with knee injuries, Spurs have a serious lack of midfield to start the season.\nFans will be expecting the club to be bold in the market and try to sign some established quality, and would love Tottenham to re-enter the race to sign Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace.\nBeyond that, there are some areas that could do with strengthening, such as another left-sided defender, or possibly another centre forward.\nSpurs have five senior centre-backs. Micky van de Ven and Cristian Romero are first-choice. Kevin Danso appears to have become the best backup option while Radu Dragusin recovers from an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury he suffered in January. Kota Takai joined Spurs from J League side Kawasaki Frontale earlier this summer but has not featured in any pre-season games because he is suffering from a foot injury. Luka Vuskovic looks promising, but is more likely to head out on loan for regular game time to help his development.\nThey are interested in signing another centre-back before the window closes. Van de Ven and Romero both missed large chunks of last season through injury. Dragusin will not be available any time soon, and Takai will need time to acclimatise to a new country and environment. Spurs need more depth and quality to enable them to compete in the Premier League and the Champions League, and to avoid the injury crisis they suffered under Postecoglou last season.\nBut midfield remains the big story for the rest of August.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nSon\u2019s move to MLS is likely to be tied up soon, with Spurs hoping to get a fee of close to \u00a320m, which would mean they had almost made back the whole \u00a322m they paid Bayer Leverkusen for him 10 years ago.\nAdvertisement\nEven after Son\u2019s departure, there will be questions about a few other senior players, just in case offers come in that are worth Tottenham thinking about, such as Richarlison or Bissouma. But Cristian Romero, about whom there was so much speculation earlier in the window, looks set to stay.\nAtletico Madrid have given up on signing him and have already signed Slovakian international centre-back David Hancko from Feyenoord.\nBen Davies admitted there is uncertainty over his long-term future in an interview with The Athletic. However, Frank has been impressed by the Wales international, who has featured regularly in pre-season at left-back. He values the 32-year-old\u2019s experience and mentality. Frank believes he is a positive influence within the dressing room and is considering him for a role in the leadership group.\nBentancur has entered the final year of his contract, and Frank has been full of praise for him, too. He thinks the Uruguay international can be a key player long-term. If so, Spurs need to start discussions over a new deal if they haven\u2019t already.\nElsewhere, there is the possibility of younger players leaving Spurs, with Alfie Devine and Dane Scarlett still waiting for loan deals.\nJack Pitt-Brooke and Jay Harris\nBarcelona\nWhat happened this week?\nBarcelona came to the end of their pre-season tour on Monday with a convincing 5-0 win against Daegu FC, with Marcus Rashford scoring his first goal in a Barcelona shirt.\nLast week, they beat Seoul FC 7-3 with Lamine Yamal and Ferran Torres scoring two goals each. The Catalans ended their trip to Japan and South Korea with 15 goals scored across three games.\nNow they return to Barcelona to finalise their work before the start of La Liga. They will face Como at home next Sunday in the traditional Joan Gamper pre-season trophy.\nMeanwhile, Marc-Andre ter Stegen underwent surgery on his back injury successfully last week. Now it will be up to La Liga to determine if the goalkeeper\u2019s injury can be considered long-term, and therefore free up salary space to register a new Barca player.\nWho are Barcelona at risk of not being able to register?\nThe list is not short. All new signings from this summer need to be included: Joan Garcia, Marcus Rashford and Roony Bardghji. There\u2019s Wojciech Szczesny, too. Finally, Barcelona have to register Gerard Martin. The left-back played last season while being registered as an academy player, but after a significant number of appearances under Hansi Flick, La Liga will now force Barcelona to include him in their first team.\nAdvertisement\nThe number one priority in that department is Garcia. Barcelona want to get his registration resolved as soon as possible, and club president Joan Laporta said during the pre-season tour last week that they are working on it.\n\u201cAll the registrations are progressing adequately. It is better to work in silence and not speak too much about it in public,\u201d said Laporta on Saturday.\nAn element that could have an impact on registrations is Ter Stegen\u2019s injury. The German goalkeeper underwent surgery on his back last week in France. Now, Barcelona are expected to submit medical reports to La Liga, who will assess them. La Liga\u2019s independent medical panel will evaluate the injury and decide whether it can be deemed as a long-term injury. This would mean an expected recovery time of at least four months. If they do, Barcelona would be in a position to use 80 per cent of Ter Stegen\u2019s salary to register a new player.\n\u201cJoan Garcia\u2019s registration does not depend on Ter Stegen,\u201d Laporta said on the weekend. \u201cBut his absence, given it is an important injury, could provide a more straightforward way to register him\u201d.\nWith Rashford and Szczesny, the club maintain they will eventually be registered without any major sale completed. In the case of Bardghji, Barcelona are aware they could potentially register the Swedish winger as a Barcelona Atletic player if there\u2019s no room for him as a first-team one.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nAccording to well-placed sources within the club, Barcelona are done with signings in this transfer window.\nAfter the arrivals of Garcia, Szczesny, Rashford and Bardghji, Laporta and Deco do not expect any other major arrivals this summer, and they are now focused on registrations.\nWhich players could be leaving?\nHector Fort is the only first-team player with a big chance of leaving. The 19-year-old right-back has lost his place in Flick\u2019s priority list in his position to Eric Garcia, who was fantastic last season when he was required in the role.\nThere is practically no game time in sight for Fort, which pushed Barca and Flick to tell the player it would be best for him to find a new club. Although Fort did not intend to leave initially, Barcelona\u2019s clarity over his role has made him reconsider. The club are searching for a permanent sale, while aiming to keep close tabs on the defender with a buy-back clause.\nAdvertisement\nOn other names, there have been plenty of rumours in local media. The likes of Fermin Lopez and Marc Casado have been named as players who could raise interest abroad, and ones that Barcelona would be very willing to listen to offers for.\nHowever, the reality is that none of those players intend to leave \u2014 even knowing they are not close to having a starting role \u2014 and Flick is very happy to keep them. Barca won\u2019t actively push for a sale, and at this point club sources acknowledge that there is no major sale contemplated.\nFlick is going to have a deep squad to handle, which is certainly a luxury to have, but at the same time, can be a man-management challenge for the German.\nPol Ballus\nReal Madrid\nWhat happened this week?\nThere was no major movement in terms of signings, and this is not expected to change unless space is freed up in the squad. For now, no further departures are expected after the exits of academy players Chema Andres (Stuttgart), Jacobo Ramon (Como) and Mario Martin (Getafe) were confirmed.\nArgentina midfielder Franco Mastantuono arrived in Madrid on Sunday, although the 17-year-old is not expected to be officially presented until he turns 18 on August 14.\nDoes Xabi Alonso have the right squad for his style of play?\nAlthough in his last press conference in the United States \u2014 after the 4-0 Club World Cup semi-final defeat to Paris Saint-Germain \u2014 Alonso left the door open to further improving the squad, the signings that have been made are in line with his project.\nUpon his arrival at Madrid, the Basque coach played an active role in the signings of Alvaro Carreras, Dean Huijsen and Mastantuono, all of whom he called to convince them to join. My colleague Mario Cortegana understands from sources close to the coaching setup that Alonso feels there is still room for improvement. One source suggests Alonso and his staff would like two signings, possibly one to replace Rodrygo in case the Brazilian leaves. The club\u2019s view is that the team has been built with Alonso in mind.\nWhat positions/players are they still looking at?\nAlthough Madrid are always keeping an eye on the market and evaluating players, it is not clear if they have anyone specific in mind for the rest of the transfer window.\nSources who have recently been in contact with the club tell The Athletic they have been looking at options for midfield, but none of them have been fully convincing. In contrast, club sources insist the squad is closed to any more arrivals and that Alonso will have to adapt to what is available.\nAdvertisement\nWhich players could be leaving?\nAlthough both the club and Alonso are open to Rodrygo leaving, there have been no developments in his case and, according to sources close to the player, the Brazilian has indicated he wants to stay. My colleague Mario Cortegana has been told by sources close to the coaching staff that Alonso and his team are not entirely happy with Rodrygo. The player is working with intermediary Pini Zahavi this summer, which could indicate he is not so clear about his position at the club.\nBoth Endrick and Gonzalo Garcia are keen to stay. According to a source close to Gonzalo, the striker\u2019s agent, Oscar Ribot, is working on an extension and an improvement to his contract after his impressive performances at the Club World Cup.\nThe club has not yet announced who will wear the No 9 shirt, which is telling. Club sources say the decision is yet to be made.\nFrench left-back Ferland Mendy intends to stay at Madrid and compete with Carreras and Fran Garcia, but his camp is surprised the club has not yet announced his contract renewal (which, as The Athletic reported at the time, was finalised last year).\nMadrid retain a 50 per cent sell-on clause for the 20-year-old midfielder Nico Paz after his sale to Como last year. This year, Madrid have decided to waive their buy-back clause \u2014 they can re-sign him for \u20ac9m next year or \u20ac10m in 2027. Como have intended to buy out Madrid\u2019s sell-on rights for months after seeing a lot of potential in Paz last season.\nAccording to various sources involved in negotiations, there is no clause in the current agreement as to how Como could do that. When the idea was first raised a few months ago, sources at Madrid rejected the idea of losing control over a player they see as a potential star.\nReinier Jesus is set to join Atletico Mineiro in his native Brazil. The Athletic reported last week that they were the best-placed suitors for the 23-year-old. Reinier, who joined for \u20ac30m from Flamengo in 2020 and has never played for Madrid\u2019s first team, is expected to sign until December 2029 for the Brazilian side. Madrid will not receive any money but will retain a 50 per cent sell-on clause.\nGuillermo Rai\n(Top photos: Maryam Majd/Getty Images, David Klein/AP Photo; design: Dan Goldfarb)"

      "text": "Chelsea have completed the signing of Jorrel Hato from Ajax for a fee in excess of \u20ac40million plus a sell-on clause.\nHato has agreed a seven-year deal with Chelsea, tying him to the club until 2032.\nAs part of this summer\u2019s transfer coverage on The Athletic, in addition to breaking news, tactical analysis and in-depth reads, our Transfers TLDR series (you can read them all here) will bring you a quick guide to each of the key deals.\nGive me their backstory in 100 words\u2026\nHe is a shooting star of a defender who can play centre-back or left-back. Hato is (and plays like) an Ajax academy graduate who joined the club at 12 and who, in February 2023, became the third-youngest Eredivisie debutant in history. He even captained the club as a 17-year-old during a Europa League game in December 2024.\nAdvertisement\nChelsea are buying a seasoned player. Hato has been a Dutch international since winning his first cap in late 2023 and, in total, for club and country, has now played over 9,000 minutes as a senior professional.\nSebastian Stafford-Bloor\nWhat should and shouldn\u2019t I expect to see?\nDespite Hato\u2019s youth, you can already expect him to be comfortable and confident on the ball. His passing accuracy is strong, and while he may need some adjustment to the physical demands of the Premier League, fans should expect to see him looking to play out from the back rather than going long. Unsurprisingly, considering his frame, expect him to be strong in the air.\nHato is certainly a forward-thinking defender in terms of his ability to help build attacks from deep, and looks set to rotate in for Marc Cucurella on the left, but do not expect a full-blown wing-back who is up the pitch swinging crosses into the penalty area.\nCerys Jones\nHow will they fit tactically?\nHato\u2019s comfort in possession and defensive IQ, along with his ability to play at centre-back and left-back, should help him fit seamlessly into Enzo Maresca\u2019s system. The 19-year-old is a viable alternative for Marc Cucurella and his height should ensure Chelsea are not targeted down their left side as teams often did last season.\nWith the ball at his feet, Hato is good at progressing play through the flanks or the middle of the pitch, as this graph outlining his most common line-breaking passes shows.\nHato is a solid ball-carrier, too, displaying an elegance in possession that belies his 6ft (182cm) frame and age.\nAdapting to the Premier League and finding playing time in one of Europe\u2019s biggest squads will pose challenges, but Hato has the qualities to thrive at the highest level.\nAnantaajith Raghuraman\nWhat\u2019s their injury record?\nSpotless. Hato became a first-team regular properly at Ajax in 2023-24 and has appeared in over 40 games at club level in each of the past two seasons, without any significant injuries at all.\nSebastian Stafford-Bloor\nSomeone who knows him says\u2026\n\u201cHe\u2019s fast, he\u2019s strong, a good height, not too tall for a central defender, overall good technique, pretty complete. A true Ajax player,\u201d says former Netherlands and Ajax defender Frank De Boer.\n\u201cHe has a positive attitude (on the pitch), like \u2018Bring it on, I\u2019ll do my thing\u2019. He dribbles past people at the right moment. Ajax should always be able to bring on youth players with bravery. In my eyes, he is a perfect example.\u201d\nSebastian Stafford-Bloor\nWhat do we know about the finances of the deal?\nChelsea have spent in excess of \u20ac40m (\u00a334.7m) on Hato, with a sell-on clause of unknown value also included in the deal.\nThe 19-year-old has joined from Ajax on a seven-year contract, signing up to terms at Stamford Bridge until June 2032. Premier League and UEFA rules do, however, dictate that Chelsea will only be able to spread the cost of acquiring Hato over five years.\nChris Weatherspoon\nWhat impact will this have on Chelsea\u2019s PSR calculation?\nAssuming agent fees of 10 per cent plus a four per cent transfer levy, signing Hato will add \u00a37.1m in amortisation costs to Chelsea\u2019s 2025-26 books, then a further \u00a37.9m per season to the end of 2029-30. Around \u00a3758,000 will then be booked into 2030-31.\nThose aren\u2019t the figures that will be reflected in Chelsea\u2019s published accounts, where they\u2019ll amortise Hato\u2019s fee over his seven-year contract. There\u2019ll therefore be a difference between public figures and those submitted as part of the club\u2019s PSR calculations; Hato\u2019s fee will be amortised at \u00a35.6m annually in the club\u2019s books until the end of 2031-32, \u00a32.3m less than the figure in Chelsea\u2019s PSR workings for 2026-27 to 2028-29.\nAdvertisement\nInternational transfers require solidarity payments to be paid to clubs involved in player development between the ages of 12 and 23, but Hato has been at Ajax since the age of 12, meaning they should keep all of the proceeds from the deal.\nWith little to nothing in book value by virtue of coming through the club\u2019s academy, last season\u2019s Eredivisie runners-up should bank the full \u20ac40m as profit in their 2025-26 financials.\nChris Weatherspoon\n(Top photo: Jeroen van den Berg/Soccrates/Getty Images)"

  "argos_summary": "Chelsea secured a 2-0 victory over Bayer Leverkusen in their first pre-season match, highlighted by the debut goal of teenager Estevao and a late strike from Joao Pedro. The absence of striker Nicolas Jackson, who is reportedly seeking a move away from the club, raised questions about his future as Chelsea's new signings, including Liam Delap and Joao Pedro, appear to have taken precedence in the attacking lineup. Additionally, defender Levi Colwill faces a lengthy recovery from an ACL injury, further complicating Chelsea's defensive options ahead of the new season.",
