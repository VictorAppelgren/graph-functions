      "feedback": "Your draft meets the basic structure but needs tightening to meet the 4‑line, 1‑trade rule and to eliminate noise.  \n1. **Remove the last “Up | 3‑6 mo | 95.8 …” line** – it is not in the required format and duplicates the short‑term forecast already covered.  \n2. **Condense the two Up lines**: merge the Fed cut/curve steepening driver with the CPI‑cut driver into a single “Up” scenario that captures the 0.5–1 % dxy rally from the Fed’s September 25 bp cut (B1KYJ1GPU, XTQIQRP5K).  Keep the watch items (Fed minutes, 2‑yr/10‑yr spread, July CPI) and probability (60 %) as you have.  \n3. **Condense the two Down lines**: combine the CPI‑above‑3 % + tariff escalation and the Fed‑hike/30‑yr Treasury rise into one “Down” scenario that reflects a 45 % chance of a 0.5–1 % dxy decline (XTQIQRP5K, LF0UUL917).  Watch items should be Fed minutes, tariff announcements, 30‑yr Treasury yield; invalidation is a Fed rate hike or 30‑yr Treasury rise.  \n4. **Add a Swing Trade line** (since dxy is tradable):  \n   *Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence 0–100*  \n   Example: **Down | 3‑6 mo | 95.8 | 95.2 | 96.8 | 1:2 | Fed hike/30‑yr Treasury rise | Fed minutes/30‑yr Treasury yield | 60% | 80**.  Use the 95.8 forecast (Z7O1DCHS7) for entry, 95.2 (≈0.5 % below) for stop, 96.8 (≈1 % above) for target, and cite the same sources as in the scenario lines.  \n5. **Ensure every numeric claim is cited**: the 0.5–1 % dxy gain (XTQIQRP5K), the 95.8 short‑term forecast (Z7O1DCHS7), the 30‑yr Treasury impact on mortgage rates (LF0UUL917).  \n6. **Keep the output concise**: exactly 4 lines (2 Up, 2 Down) followed by the single trade line. No extra commentary or duplicate information. This will satisfy the acceptance gate and provide a clear, actionable outlook.",
