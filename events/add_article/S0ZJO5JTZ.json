      "summary": "The post-launch review finds the app’s experience inconsistent and somewhat unfinished, with basic inquiries and personalized recommendations falling short. Users noted that the app could determine their zip code but failed to tailor suggestions to that area, and the Discover feed displayed irrelevant, often edgy images that may not suit all audiences. Additionally, the service’s presence on WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram remains disconnected, preventing seamless data sharing and undermining its personalization goals. Overall, the app shows promise but requires significant refinement to deliver a cohesive, user‑centric experience.",
