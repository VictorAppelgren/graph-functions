It'll be a night of good food and good company \u2014 and good luck not dropping your bread bit into the steaming pot of cheese.\n\nWe're ready to wax nostalgic about old-school food traditions that once filled kitchens and social calendars. This is a chance to appreciate wartime canning that preserved the harvests of Victory Gardens. And a chance to tip our hats to hosts of Tupperware parties, who taught a generation the essential skill of container burping. We'll thank the milkman and think a lot about gelatin molds instead of charcuterie boards. So, grab a seat and a cup of percolated coffee and join us as we explore some food customs of yore.\n\nRead more: How 12 US Presidents Liked To Have Their Steaks Cooked\n\nHaving A Utensil For Everything\n\nThe history of eating with utensils is complicated. Unsurprisingly, it's tied to wealth, class, and a whole lot of showing off. Some Victorians, for example, flaunted social standing with elaborate collections of silverware. Not just fancy swirly patterns, but hundreds of utensils with very specific purposes. Coffee spoons were smaller than tea spoons. Sorbet spoons differed from ice cream forks and all the other forks like strawberry, snail, sardine. The lists went on and on, crossing the Atlantic and growing in America into the 20th century.\n\nBy 1926, the U.S. Department of Commerce decided enough was enough. They issued Simplified Practice Recommendation No. 54 to cap sterling silver sets at 57 pieces. This voluntary industry agreement was mostly followed but still left America with plenty of spoons. The document included basic tea, dessert, table, and soup spoons; fancier bouillon, coffee, iced tea, and grapefruit spoons; and single serving spoons for bonbons, olives, berries, preserves, and sugar -- and that was just the spoons.\n\nOver the years, many of these ultra-specific pieces quietly slipped off the table. Some lingered or staged comebacks, like the grapefruit spoon in the 1970s. But nowadays, most of us stir coffee with any ole teaspoon, spear strawberries with a regular fork, and, if we even own a grapefruit spoon, probably use it to scoop out an avocado. Victorians might be banging their marrow spoons in horror, but we seem OK without a spoon just for bone goo.\n\nOnce upon a time, every home cook's most prized possession wasn't a fancy stand mixer or an air fryer \u2014 it was a simple stack of 3x5-inch index cards. Those little cards that were tucked neatly into a recipe box, held culinary traditions, like the family's go-to birthday cake, a must-have Thanksgiving pie, and maybe even that casserole nobody liked but everyone politely ate anyway. The cards were time capsules covered in gravy splatters, dotted with frosting fingerprints, and often stuffed alongside photos, grocery lists, or quick notes that read something like \"Don't forget extra nutmeg!\"\n\nMany of these recipes were handwritten treasures, but others were preprinted. From the 1930s through the 1990s, magazines offered recipe subscriptions, sending out recipe cards to help readers expand their collections. Of course, advertisers were quick to use the idea to promote products. Really, how could you make Jell-O salad without Jell-O? Cards made it easy to tuck brand names right into your personal recipe box.\n\nThese days, instead of a recipe box, we're more likely to turn to a food blog, TikTok video, or recipe app. The recipe card is still around, but in digital form. Paper just can't compete with the infinite scroll.\n\nCheese fondue melted Americans' hearts when it was showcased at the 1964 World's Fair in New York. What followed was a decades-long love affair of dipping hunks of bread (or really anything that could balance on a long fork) into a bubbling pot of cheese. The \"fondue party\" era was born, with stores selling party kits and premade mixes so anyone could host their own cheesy gathering.\n\nCookbooks and magazines piled on recipes, popular TV shows like Julia Child's \"The French Chef\" stirred up the fondue pot, and advertisers happily jumped aboard. In the late '60s, Lipton pitched its Onion Soup Mix as the secret to an easy Lipton Fondue American recipe, while the 1970s saw Van Camp's advertise its Pork and Beans with a Franktastic Fondue recipe.\n\nBy the time the Franktastic Fondue recipe was circulating, sleek electric models challenged the traditional flame-heated fondue pots. The new plug-in versions promised to keep your cheese at the perfect temperature and made it easy to bring the party into the living room or out on the patio. No matter the location, fondue parties often came with playful etiquette. Drop your bread in the pot twice, congratulations \u2014 you just volunteered to host the next fondue night. But maybe not enough people dropped their bread pieces, because by the '80s and '90s, the fondue party craze had cooled. Electric pots were relegated to the back of the cupboard and everyone seemed to lose their appetite for cheese-coated pork-and-bean experiments.\n\nBack in the day, Johnny Carson got a lot of mileage out of fruitcake jokes on \"The Tonight Show.\" He suggested there's only one fruitcake in the world that just gets regifted every Christmas. For decades, fruitcake has been the punchline of the holiday season. But that wasn't always the case.\n\nFruitcake is deeply rooted in American culture. Martha Washington, the former first lady, had a famous Great Cake recipe. Essentially, it was a dense fruitcake soaked in brandy and filled with dried fruit and nuts. It became a White House holiday tradition, with some administrations baking hundreds of cakes to share with guests. According to former White House executive chef Henry Haller, every president he served had fruitcake on the holiday table. That included Gerald Ford, whose family enjoyed giving homemade fruitcakes as gifts. Ford held office in the 1970s. It's proof that, even into the '70s, fruitcake was a dessert fit for a president.\n\nBut it wasn't just the political elite who embraced homemade fruitcake as a holiday tradition. The Los Angeles Times called it a \"holiday must\" in 1953. Life magazine featured fruitcake in a full-color spread in 1961, promising it would \"provide a generous welcome for guests.\" But times change -- in 1989, a MasterCard survey found fruitcake topped the list of least-wanted Christmas presents. Artisanal cookies and fancy chocolates may have pushed aside fruitcake. But that immortal labor of love is still out there somewhere, patiently waiting for its comeback.\n\nAmerica knew how to meal prep in 1943. That year, at the height of World War II, home canning was at its absolute peak. Billions of jars and cans were processed. People canned home-raised meats like rabbit and chicken, along with a wide variety of fruits and vegetables \u2014 everything from apples and asparagus to peaches and peas.\n\nThe government promoted \"Victory Gardens\" and preservation as patriotic. People grew produce and took up pickling, dehydrating, and canning. Pamphlets and classes showed Americans how to transform backyard and community harvests into neatly stacked rows of jars that could outlast the season (and maybe even survive the apocalypse).\n\nBut after the war ended in 1945, home canning started slipping out of fashion. Refrigerators became more affordable, grocery stores filled up, and frankly, people were ready to spend less time boiling jars in sweltering kitchens. The movement got a brief second wind with improved pressure canners and a do-it-yourself movement in the 1970s. Today, some people still keep the tradition alive, though now it's more about small-batch jams and Instagram-worthy pickle jars than wartime survival.\n\nBaraboo Supper Club in Boise defines a supper club as simply: \"A social dining establishment where people come together for good food and a good time.\" So, how does that differ from a restaurant? The answer might be drowning in booze. Back in the Prohibition era, speakeasies popped up as hush-hush spots to snag an illegal drink. When alcohol was legal again in the early 1930s, many of those speakeasies traded secrecy for supper. They evolved into places where you could linger over dinner, sip a cocktail (legally), and enjoy some live music.\n\nUnlike a high-paced restaurant focused on fast turnover, supper clubs are all about slowing down. Imagine dim lighting, a fixed or limited multicourse meal, and maybe a piano tinkling away in the background. For many supper clubs, community and connection are just as important as the food. Though they're found in big cities, supper clubs have humble Midwest origins. They're tucked away on the edge of town and in rural areas of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and Iowa.\n\nSupper clubs thrived through the mid-20th century. Then along came fast food drive-thrus and casual dining chains, and suddenly the slow, lingering supper fell out of fashion. But they're far from extinct. If you're looking for a taste of nostalgia paired with a cocktail, a supper club is a good bet. Just don't expect any Instagram-worthy photos with the supper club's infamous dim lighting.\n\nThe year 1904 was a wobbly one. Jell-O's popularity exploded as it adopted the slogan \"America's Most Famous Dessert.\" That same year, Knox Gelatine held a recipe contest, where Perfection Salad snagged third place. Perfection, it turns out, was defined as shredded cabbage, celery chunks, and pimentos suspended in a lemony-vinegary gelatin mold. To top it off, drizzle on mayonnaise. What a delicious start to the century!\n\nBy mid-century, Knox's unflavored gelatin was still wobbling along (and still is), but the popularity of Jell-O took over. Cooks even used this pre-sweetened concoction in savory recipes \u2014 just swap lemon juice for Lemon Jell-O. And yup, that hack worked for Perfection Salad. It also worked for Jellied Potato Salad and the ever-questionable Savory Vegetable Salad Mold (featuring lima beans, celery, and onion). On the sweeter side, people whipped up Jewel-Top Jell-O (that's Jell-O topped with \u2014 wait for it \u2014 more Jell-O) or the Crown Jewel Pie, which looked like a stained-glass window you could eat.\n\nFor a solid few decades, potlucks weren't complete without at least one quivering gelatin mold on the table. Thanksgiving spreads often included a mysterious \"salad\" that was part dessert, part side dish, and fully confusing. But over the years, America's Jell-O obsession declined. These days, Jell-O salad features prominently on the list of old-school salads no one makes anymore. But Lemon Jell-O is still widely available. So, if you're feeling creative, you can keep the tradition of wiggly salads alive. Just don't forget the mayonnaise garnish.\n\nPeople have cooked with lard for thousands of years. It used to be an American pantry staple for frying eggs, baking cakes, and larding meat. And it's famous for making perfectly flaky pie crusts. But somewhere along the way, people stopped buying lard. There was one large can-sized culprit: Crisco.\n\nProcter & Gamble's launch of Crisco was a masterclass in early 20th-century marketing. At a time when the public was still grossed out by Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" (a fictional but all-too-real depiction of the meat-packing industry), Crisco came in looking pure and clean. \"The stomach welcomes Crisco,\" was one slogan. The company described the product as \"purely vegetable.\" Never mind that nobody really knew what was actually in it. It was white, odorless, tasteless, and shelf-stable. It had no horrors of \"The Jungle.\" Crisco sold like hotcakes \u2014 and people were now frying their hotcakes in Crisco.\n\nBy the 1950s, things got even worse for poor lard. Scientists expressed concerns about saturated fat. Suddenly, lard was being talked about like it had personally clogged every artery in America. But the plot thickened (kind of like gravy made with lard) when newer research suggested that saturated fats might not be quite as villainous as once believed, at least in moderation. Add to that a growing interest in natural fats and food regulations that have helped \"The Jungle\" situation, and lard may be poised for a comeback. Sometimes food trends come full circle, much like a perfectly flaky pie crust.\n\nTupperware became so well-known that its name slipped into generic use, like how we say \"Band-Aid\" for any adhesive bandage. The plastic containers with snug lids first appeared in the 1940s, thanks to inventor Earl Tupper. But unlike the leftovers they were meant to preserve, Tupperware sales went stale. Instead of sealing the deal, the lids were part of the problem. Tupperware containers had to be \"burped\" to close properly, but customers didn't get the memo. Many thought the lids didn't fit right and returned them in frustration. So, Tupperware reinvented its sales strategy. Forget about department stores, it was time to party!\n\nTupperware parties were part sales pitch, part social event. Hosts invited neighbors and friends over, set out snacks, and showed off Tupperware's durability by tossing containers across the living room. Guests learned the fine art of the Tupperware burp, order forms made the rounds, and the host earned a cut of the sales. While the image was often suburban housewives leading the charge, all types of people turned the business of selling plastic containers into a serious side hustle.\n\nTupperware parties surged during the 1950s and 1960s. The sales strategy lingered for decades, but competition and growing health and environmental concerns about plastic meant the party was dying out. Tupperware filed for bankruptcy in 2024 and the brand was acquired by Party Products. At least for now, Tupperware continues to limp along. But most people don't bother with Tupperware parties anymore.\n\nThrough the 1960s, if you wanted coffee at home, chances are you fired up a percolator. These came in stovetop and electric versions, and they could make a whole pot of Joe big enough to keep the neighborhood buzzing. Unfortunately, they had a bit of a reputation for producing a bitter brew. That's what happens when you keep sending boiling water over the same tired coffee grounds.\n\nIn 1972, Mr. Coffee fixed our caffeine fix. The automatic drip machine was faster and brewed a better-tasting cup of coffee. Within just a few years, 5 million Mr. Coffee machines had found their way into kitchens. By the late '70s, department stores were selling more than 40,000 of them a day. Just like that, the percolator was pushed aside, destined for garage sales or the back of the cupboard.\n\nPercolators continued to become less and less relevant as more drip machines hit store shelves. Keurig entered homes in 2004, and we now have a dizzying array of home options \u2014 even espresso machines that sync with your phone. Despite all these options, not all coffee drinkers have given up on percolators. Supposedly, with the right technique, it's possible to brew a strong, delicious cup. For these caffeine enthusiasts, outdated percolators remain part of the daily grind.\n\nMilk spoils quickly. So, before every kitchen came equipped with a reliable fridge, getting daily delivery was the safest and most cost-effective way to get milk. Into the 1950s and '60s, the milkman was part of daily life for many families. Each day, he'd swing by the house, collect your empty glass bottles, and leave behind fresh ones filled with cold milk. Some homes had insulated boxes on the porch and others had fancy little double-doored cubbies built right into the wall, so your milk could magically appear without even opening your front door.\n\nBut as America expanded into the suburbs, the milkman's job got trickier. His route grew longer, delivery costs went up, and meanwhile, more folks were buying cars and refrigerators. Grocery stores got bigger, with sprawling refrigerated sections ready to stock everything from cheddar to chocolate milk. Plus, new processing methods helped milk last longer. The milkman was no longer needed to get milk at home. By 1975, fewer than 7% of households still had milk delivered. By 2005, that number had trickled down to under 1%. The clink of glass bottles on the porch no longer echoed through the ages.\n\nBut the milkman (or milkwoman) is not extinct! Interest in fresh and local food has helped keep the tradition alive. Some local dairies deliver to thousands of customers, many of whom appreciate both the convenience and quality of fresh milk. Nostalgia is tasty and packed with calcium.\n\nA 2013 report by Nutrition Journal revealed something your grandma probably already suspected \u2014 Americans just aren't cooking like they used to. Compared to 1965, fewer of us are stepping into the kitchen each day \u2014 and those who do are spending way less time there. A follow-up study in 2018 showed a small uptick in home cooking, but it was still nowhere near the levels of the past. That 2018 study noted \"increased food costs, decreased time availability, and lack of skill\" as key factors in the decline of overall cooking.\n\nAmericans buy prepackaged food and eat out more than in the past. We've become pros at navigating the frozen food aisle and local takeout menus. The trend was already developing in the 1980s. The book \"Recent Social Trends in the United States 1960-1990\" explained that, \"Between 1950 and 1980, the fraction of family food expenditures spent on meals away from home doubled.\" So what'll be? Double Whopper, Double-Double, or a Double Decker Taco?\n\nEven when we do cook these days, convenience often enters the kitchen. Taco Tuesday might not be a drive-thru, but the meal can still be sped up with pre-seasoned taco meat, pre-shredded cheese, pre-diced onions, a squirt of sour cream from a tube, and a tub of fresh pico de gallo. And many of us aren't loading up all these delicious ingredients into from-scratch flour tortillas. Who can blame us? Life is busy, and weeknights don't come with extra hours.",

The handwritten recipes on 3x5-inch index cards. Maybe you'll find that recipe that uses Lipton's Onion Soup Mix to make fondue. Would that be a good one for this Saturday's fondue party? It'll be a night of good food and good company \u2014 and good luck not dropping your bread bit into the steaming pot of cheese.\nWe're ready to wax nostalgic about old-school food traditions that once filled kitchens and social calendars.

We'll thank the milkman and think a lot about gelatin molds instead of charcuterie boards. So, grab a seat and a cup of percolated coffee and join us as we explore some food customs of yore.\n1. Having a utensil for everything\nThe history of eating with utensils is complicated. Unsurprisingly, it's tied to wealth, class, and a whole lot of showing off. Some Victorians, for example, flaunted social standing with elaborate collections of silverware. Not just fancy swirly patterns, but hundreds of utensils with very specific purposes. Coffee spoons were smaller than tea spoons. Sorbet spoons differed from ice cream forks and all the other forks like strawberry, snail, sardine.

Some lingered or staged comebacks, like the grapefruit spoon in the 1970s. But nowadays, most of us stir coffee with any ole teaspoon, spear strawberries with a regular fork, and, if we even own a grapefruit spoon, probably use it to scoop out an avocado. Victorians might be banging their marrow spoons in horror, but we seem OK without a spoon just for bone goo.\n2. Writing and keeping recipe cards\nOnce upon a time, every home cook's most prized possession wasn't a fancy stand mixer or an air fryer \u2014 it was a simple stack of 3x5-inch index cards. Those little cards that were tucked neatly into a recipe box, held culinary traditions, like the family's go-to birthday cake, a must-have Thanksgiving pie, and maybe even that casserole nobody liked but everyone politely ate anyway. The cards were time capsules covered in gravy splatters, dotted with frosting fingerprints, and often stuffed alongside photos, grocery lists, or quick notes that read something like \"Don't forget extra nutmeg!\"\nMany of these recipes were handwritten treasures, but others were preprinted. From the 1930s through the 1990s, magazines offered recipe subscriptions, sending out recipe cards to help readers expand their collections. Of course, advertisers were quick to use the idea to promote products. Really, how could you make Jell-O salad without Jell-O? Cards made it easy to tuck brand names right into your personal recipe box.\nThese days, instead of a recipe box, we're more likely to turn to a food blog, TikTok video, or recipe app. The recipe card is still around, but in digital form. Paper just can't compete with the infinite scroll.\n3. Hosting fondue parties\nCheese fondue melted Americans' hearts when it was showcased at the 1964 World's Fair in New York. What followed was a decades-long love affair of dipping hunks of bread (or really anything that could balance on a long fork) into a bubbling pot of cheese. The \"fondue party\" era was born, with stores selling party kits and premade mixes so anyone could host their own cheesy gathering.\nCookbooks and magazines piled on recipes, popular TV shows like Julia Child's \"The French Chef\" stirred up the fondue pot, and advertisers happily jumped aboard. In the late '60s, Lipton pitched its Onion Soup Mix as the secret to an easy Lipton Fondue American recipe, while the 1970s saw Van Camp's advertise its Pork and Beans with a Franktastic Fondue recipe.\nBy the time the Franktastic Fondue recipe was circulating, sleek electric models challenged the traditional flame-heated fondue pots. The new plug-in versions promised to keep your cheese at the perfect temperature and made it easy to bring the party into the living room or out on the patio. No matter the location, fondue parties often came with playful etiquette. Drop your bread in the pot twice, congratulations \u2014 you just volunteered to host the next fondue night. But maybe not enough people dropped their bread pieces, because by the '80s and '90s, the fondue party craze had cooled. Electric pots were relegated to the back of the cupboard and everyone seemed to lose their appetite for cheese-coated pork-and-bean experiments.\n4. Making a holiday fruitcake\nBack in the day, Johnny Carson got a lot of mileage out of fruitcake jokes on \"The Tonight Show.\" He suggested there's only one fruitcake in the world that just gets regifted every Christmas. For decades, fruitcake has been the punchline of the holiday season. But that wasn't always the case.\nFruitcake is deeply rooted in American culture. Martha Washington, the former first lady, had a famous Great Cake recipe. Essentially, it was a dense fruitcake soaked in brandy and filled with dried fruit and nuts. It became a White House holiday tradition, with some administrations baking hundreds of cakes to share with guests. According to former White House executive chef Henry Haller, every president he served had fruitcake on the holiday table. That included Gerald Ford, whose family enjoyed giving homemade fruitcakes as gifts. Ford held office in the 1970s. It's proof that, even into the '70s, fruitcake was a dessert fit for a president.\nBut it wasn't just the political elite who embraced homemade fruitcake as a holiday tradition. The Los Angeles Times called it a \"holiday must\" in 1953. Life magazine featured fruitcake in a full-color spread in 1961, promising it would \"provide a generous welcome for guests.\" But times change \u2014 in 1989, a MasterCard survey found fruitcake topped the list of least-wanted Christmas presents. Artisanal cookies and fancy chocolates may have pushed aside fruitcake. But that immortal labor of love is still out there somewhere, patiently waiting for its comeback.\n5. Canning and preserving at home\nAmerica knew how to meal prep in 1943. That year, at the height of World War II, home canning was at its absolute peak. Billions of jars and cans were processed. People canned home-raised meats like rabbit and chicken, along with a wide variety of fruits and vegetables \u2014 everything from apples and asparagus to peaches and peas.\nThe government promoted \"Victory Gardens\" and preservation as patriotic. People grew produce and took up pickling, dehydrating, and canning. Pamphlets and classes showed Americans how to transform backyard and community harvests into neatly stacked rows of jars that could outlast the season (and maybe even survive the apocalypse).\nBut after the war ended in 1945, home canning started slipping out of fashion. Refrigerators became more affordable, grocery stores filled up, and frankly, people were ready to spend less time boiling jars in sweltering kitchens. The movement got a brief second wind with improved pressure canners and a do-it-yourself movement in the 1970s. Today, some people still keep the tradition alive, though now it's more about small-batch jams and Instagram-worthy pickle jars than wartime survival.\n6. Dining in supper clubs\nBaraboo Supper Club in Boise defines a supper club as simply: \"A social dining establishment where people come together for good food and a good time.\" So, how does that differ from a restaurant? The answer might be drowning in booze. Back in the Prohibition era, speakeasies popped up as hush-hush spots to snag an illegal drink. When alcohol was legal again in the early 1930s, many of those speakeasies traded secrecy for supper. They evolved into places where you could linger over dinner, sip a cocktail (legally), and enjoy some live music.\nUnlike a high-paced restaurant focused on fast turnover, supper clubs are all about slowing down. Imagine dim lighting, a fixed or limited multicourse meal, and maybe a piano tinkling away in the background. For many supper clubs, community and connection are just as important as the food. Though they're found in big cities, supper clubs have humble Midwest origins. They're tucked away on the edge of town and in rural areas of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and Iowa.\nSupper clubs thrived through the mid-20th century. Then along came fast food drive-thrus and casual dining chains, and suddenly the slow, lingering supper fell out of fashion. But they're far from extinct. If you're looking for a taste of nostalgia paired with a cocktail, a supper club is a good bet. Just don't expect any Instagram-worthy photos with the supper club's infamous dim lighting.\n7. Celebrating with gelatin salads\nThe year 1904 was a wobbly one. Jell-O's popularity exploded as it adopted the slogan \"America's Most Famous Dessert.\" That same year, Knox Gelatine held a recipe contest, where Perfection Salad snagged third place. Perfection, it turns out, was defined as shredded cabbage, celery chunks, and pimentos suspended in a lemony-vinegary gelatin mold. To top it off, drizzle on mayonnaise. What a delicious start to the century!\nBy mid-century, Knox's unflavored gelatin was still wobbling along (and still is), but the popularity of Jell-O took over. Cooks even used this pre-sweetened concoction in savory recipes \u2014 just swap lemon juice for Lemon Jell-O. And yup, that hack worked for Perfection Salad. It also worked for Jellied Potato Salad and the ever-questionable Savory Vegetable Salad Mold (featuring lima beans, celery, and onion). On the sweeter side, people whipped up Jewel-Top Jell-O (that's Jell-O topped with \u2014 wait for it \u2014 more Jell-O) or the Crown Jewel Pie, which looked like a stained-glass window you could eat.\nFor a solid few decades, potlucks weren't complete without at least one quivering gelatin mold on the table. Thanksgiving spreads often included a mysterious \"salad\" that was part dessert, part side dish, and fully confusing. But over the years, America's Jell-O obsession declined. These days, Jell-O salad features prominently on the list of old-school salads no one makes anymore. But Lemon Jell-O is still widely available. So, if you're feeling creative, you can keep the tradition of wiggly salads alive. Just don't forget the mayonnaise garnish.\n8. Cooking with lard\nPeople have cooked with lard for thousands of years. It used to be an American pantry staple for frying eggs, baking cakes, and larding meat. And it's famous for making perfectly flaky pie crusts. But somewhere along the way, people stopped buying lard. There was one large can-sized culprit: Crisco.\nProcter & Gamble's launch of Crisco was a masterclass in early 20th-century marketing. At a time when the public was still grossed out by Upton Sinclair's \"The Jungle\" (a fictional but all-too-real depiction of the meat-packing industry), Crisco came in looking pure and clean. \"The stomach welcomes Crisco,\" was one slogan. The company described the product as \"purely vegetable.\" Never mind that nobody really knew what was actually in it. It was white, odorless, tasteless, and shelf-stable. It had no horrors of \"The Jungle.\" Crisco sold like hotcakes \u2014 and people were now frying their hotcakes in Crisco.\nBy the 1950s, things got even worse for poor lard. Scientists expressed concerns about saturated fat. Suddenly, lard was being talked about like it had personally clogged every artery in America. But the plot thickened (kind of like gravy made with lard) when newer research suggested that saturated fats might not be quite as villainous as once believed, at least in moderation. Add to that a growing interest in natural fats and food regulations that have helped \"The Jungle\" situation, and lard may be poised for a comeback. Sometimes food trends come full circle, much like a perfectly flaky pie crust.\n9. Hosting Tupperware parties\nTupperware became so well-known that its name slipped into generic use, like how we say \"Band-Aid\" for any adhesive bandage. The plastic containers with snug lids first appeared in the 1940s, thanks to inventor Earl Tupper. But unlike the leftovers they were meant to preserve, Tupperware sales went stale. Instead of sealing the deal, the lids were part of the problem. Tupperware containers had to be \"burped\" to close properly, but customers didn't get the memo. Many thought the lids didn't fit right and returned them in frustration. So, Tupperware reinvented its sales strategy. Forget about department stores, it was time to party!\nTupperware parties were part sales pitch, part social event. Hosts invited neighbors and friends over, set out snacks, and showed off Tupperware's durability by tossing containers across the living room. Guests learned the fine art of the Tupperware burp, order forms made the rounds, and the host earned a cut of the sales. While the image was often suburban housewives leading the charge, all types of people turned the business of selling plastic containers into a serious side hustle.\nTupperware parties surged during the 1950s and 1960s. The sales strategy lingered for decades, but competition and growing health and environmental concerns about plastic meant the party was dying out. Tupperware filed for bankruptcy in 2024 and the brand was acquired by Party Products. At least for now, Tupperware continues to limp along. But most people don't bother with Tupperware parties anymore.\n10. Brewing coffee with a percolator\nThrough the 1960s, if you wanted coffee at home, chances are you fired up a percolator. These came in stovetop and electric versions, and they could make a whole pot of Joe big enough to keep the neighborhood buzzing. Unfortunately, they had a bit of a reputation for producing a bitter brew. That's what happens when you keep sending boiling water over the same tired coffee grounds.\nIn 1972, Mr. Coffee fixed our caffeine fix. The automatic drip machine was faster and brewed a better-tasting cup of coffee. Within just a few years, 5 million Mr. Coffee machines had found their way into kitchens. By the late '70s, department stores were selling more than 40,000 of them a day. Just like that, the percolator was pushed aside, destined for garage sales or the back of the cupboard.\nPercolators continued to become less and less relevant as more drip machines hit store shelves. Keurig entered homes in 2004, and we now have a dizzying array of home options \u2014 even espresso machines that sync with your phone. Despite all these options, not all coffee drinkers have given up on percolators. Supposedly, with the right technique, it's possible to brew a strong, delicious cup. For these caffeine enthusiasts, outdated percolators remain part of the daily grind.\n11. Receiving daily fresh milk from the milkman\nMilk spoils quickly. So, before every kitchen came equipped with a reliable fridge, getting daily delivery was the safest and most cost-effective way to get milk. Into the 1950s and '60s, the milkman was part of daily life for many families. Each day, he'd swing by the house, collect your empty glass bottles, and leave behind fresh ones filled with cold milk. Some homes had insulated boxes on the porch and others had fancy little double-doored cubbies built right into the wall, so your milk could magically appear without even opening your front door.\nBut as America expanded into the suburbs, the milkman's job got trickier. His route grew longer, delivery costs went up, and meanwhile, more folks were buying cars and refrigerators. Grocery stores got bigger, with sprawling refrigerated sections ready to stock everything from cheddar to chocolate milk. Plus, new processing methods helped milk last longer. The milkman was no longer needed to get milk at home. By 1975, fewer than 7% of households still had milk delivered. By 2005, that number had trickled down to under 1%. The clink of glass bottles on the porch no longer echoed through the ages.\nBut the milkman (or milkwoman) is not extinct! Interest in fresh and local food has helped keep the tradition alive. Some local dairies deliver to thousands of customers, many of whom appreciate both the convenience and quality of fresh milk. Nostalgia is tasty and packed with calcium.\n12. Spending hours a day cooking\nA 2013 report by Nutrition Journal revealed something your grandma probably already suspected \u2014 Americans just aren't cooking like they used to. Compared to 1965, fewer of us are stepping into the kitchen each day \u2014 and those who do are spending way less time there. A follow-up study in 2018 showed a small uptick in home cooking, but it was still nowhere near the levels of the past. That 2018 study noted \"increased food costs, decreased time availability, and lack of skill\" as key factors in the decline of overall cooking.\nAmericans buy prepackaged food and eat out more than in the past. We've become pros at navigating the frozen food aisle and local takeout menus. The trend was already developing in the 1980s. The book \"Recent Social Trends in the United States 1960-1990\" explained that, \"Between 1950 and 1980, the fraction of family food expenditures spent on meals away from home doubled.\" So what'll be? Double Whopper, Double-Double, or a Double Decker Taco?\nEven when we do cook these days, convenience often enters the kitchen. Taco Tuesday might not be a drive-thru, but the meal can still be sped up with pre-seasoned taco meat, pre-shredded cheese, pre-diced onions, a squirt of sour cream from a tube, and a tub of fresh pico de gallo. And many of us aren't loading up all these delicious ingredients into from-scratch flour tortillas. Who can blame us? Life is busy, and weeknights don't come with extra hours."

      "text": "The Real Reason Why People Stopped Buying Lard\nFat has a long and sordid history in American food culture, especially in the last century or so. We love it and crave it, as evidenced by the skyrocketing popularity of greasy fast food cuisine. We also hate it with a fervor, as proven by countless diet programs targeting fat, and the rapid growth of the health food industry (via Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences). And among all the fats out there, there is probably none more contentious than lard.\nRendered from the fattiest parts of a pig, lard was once a mainstay in pretty much every American pantry (via NPR). Fast-forward to today, and it's a safe bet that most of us don't have any lard lying around in our kitchens, nor would we want to. And why is that? How did lard go from being our go-to fat source to essentially a dirty word in the world of healthy cooking (via Slate)? Well, the answer is a little bit complicated \u2014 it involves a peek at the history books, as well as a look back at our scientific understanding of fats and health, plus a heaping dose of capitalism. Keep scrolling to find out the real reason people stopped buying lard.\nConcerns about lard started with issues in the meatpacking industry\nIf you're looking for a single person to blame for the fate of lard in American kitchens, look no further than Upton Sinclair. The muckraking journalist of the early 20th century made waves across the country when he published The Jungle in 1906 (via NPR). The novel, a fictional portrayal of immigrant factory workers, was aimed at highlighting poor working conditions among the poorest laborers in the U.S., but more than anything, it served to garner outrage and concern among Americans about the meat industry, and the unsanitary conditions in which their food was being produced for consumption (via New York Times and Constitutional Rights Foundation).\nThe newfound scrutiny of the meat industry included lard, which was rendered in these factories. It didn't help that there was a particularly grim and gory section in the novel describing the dangerous work of rendering and cooking lard in pig factories. The Jungle wrote this of workers making lard: \"their peculiar trouble was that they fell into the vats; and when they were fished out, there was never enough of them left to be worth exhibiting\". With that terrifying image in mind, Americans were becoming primed and ready for a new kind of fat to cook with. It wouldn't be long until they got one.\nCrisco stole the show from lard\nAround the same time that Americans were coming to understand the perils of the meatpacking industry, a growing soap and candle company by the name of Procter & Gamble stumbled upon a technological breakthrough that would completely change the fat game.\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Procter & Gamble was looking for ways to optimize their soap production, as well as do something with the company's huge supply of cottonseed oil, as the invention of the lightbulb led to a decline in demand for candles (via NPR). Proctor & Gamble invested in a new technology called hydrogenation, which turned cottonseed oil into the pearly, thick substance that we know today as hydrogenated vegetable oil. Proctor & Gamble dubbed it Crisco (via The Atlantic).\nThis was around 1910, just a few years after the release of The Jungle. As Procter & Gamble was looking for a way to market and sell this new product, the already growing skepticism around meat processing and lard consumption presented a perfect window of opportunity. Plus, during that time, health food claims didn't face the same regulation they do today, so Proctor & Gamble was also able to market their new Crisco product as being healthier than lard. It was an instant hit, and the rest, as they say, is history. Crisco remains a household name to this day (via The Conversation).\nThe price of lard in the early 20th century didn't help things\nOn top of safety concerns and the rollout of Crisco, a supposedly healthier alternative to animal fat, the economy was another factor that led to lard's downfall. In the early 20th century leading up to the Second World War, lard became less and less affordable.\nIn 1929, the stock market crash kicked off the Great Depression in the U.S., and millions of people lost their income. This economic downturn caused prices of food and livestock (including pigs, and thus, lard) to drop drastically across the board as supply piled up (via PBS). In response, the government carried out \"emergency livestock reductions\" (yep, they killed pigs and cows) in 1933 to help decrease this supply and thus increase prices (via Living History Farm).\nA few years later, lard prices were affected again as rationing was imposed in 1943 to support America's efforts in World War II (via The Atlantic). It is also worth noting that government calls for excess lard and other fats to be used to make military weapons during WWII caused many cooks and bakers to turn instead to shortening (and the likes of Crisco) as an alternative, perhaps aiding in the cultural shift away from lard (via Soy Info Center).\nThen there were health concerns surrounding lard\nBy the time the U.S. had recovered from the Great Depression and World War II, a new threat against lard was emerging. This time it was science. NPR reports that in the 1950s, scientists really started raising alarms about the links between lard and heart disease, which was on its way to becoming the leading cause of death among Americans (via NIH). Specifically, researchers warned that saturated fats like lard contain high levels of cholesterol, which was thought to be the main cause of heart disease (via AOCS).\nIn the last several decades, however, the tables have turned as health experts have come to new understandings about the fat and heart health. Scientists have actually found that the trans fats in vegetable shortening, like Crisco, can cause a range of health issues, including major heart problems (via Healthline). Meanwhile it seems that the saturated fat from animal sources, including butter and lard, is quite not as bad for our health as previously thought. On top of that, science has now shown that there isn't really a link between the cholesterol you eat and heart disease.\nThe snowball effect of negative public opinion hurt lard\nDespite the fact that scientists have updated their thinking on lard, the public has been slower to catch up. By the time new research was published exonerating saturated fats, decades of negative public opinion and a bad reputation among health experts had pushed lard out of most American kitchens (via NPR). And while many are hopeful and pushing for lard to find its way back into our cooking repertoire, it may take a while for the public to see lard in a positive light.\nFor so long, lard has been thought of as no more than an artery-clogging grease and a derogatory insult (via Slate). For example, on Urban Dictionary, a \"tub of lard\" is referred to as \"a person who is so fat and/or disgusting that the very sight of them invokes images of a giant vat filled with congealed animal fat.\" That's downright mean, and not just to the lard.\nMarketing by the food industry only made things worse for lard\nLard really started to face fierce competition in the market when Crisco hit the shelves in the early 20th century. Procter & Gamble launched an aggressive advertising campaign, propagating the purity of its factory-produced product, and marketing Crisco as healthier and easier to digest than lard (via The Conversation). Regulations on health claims for foods didn't really come around until the late 20th century (via Fooducate).\nThis paved the way for increased marketing by margarine and vegetable oil companies to push their products as a better fat (via AOCS). Then, as America's \"War on Fat\" (as Time Magazine puts it) waged on throughout the second half of the 20th century, there was even more urgency to market animal fat alternatives as more heart healthy. The New York Times reported that during this time \"an entire industry emerged to create fat substitutes.\" This mindset spilled across the entire food industry, with the steady rise in low or reduced fat food products, ranging from dairy to desserts, chips and snacks to even leaner meats, all backed by a major industry advertising push to \"reinforcing the less-fat-is-good-health message.\" And the marketing worked ... to the detriment of our health. Of course, all of this was turned on its head amid new scientific breakthroughs around the turn of the 21st century, which would inevitably lead to a whole new set of healthy eating trends (via Vogue).\nSafety and environmental concerns about lard remain today\nWhile lard consumption may not carry the same health risks it was once thought to, there are still major health concerns that remain when it comes to pork in general, for both people and the animal. For one, there is still a body of evidence that suggests links between pork consumption and a range of chronic health conditions, including diabetes and cancer (via ZME Science). And in more recent decades, research has shown an increasing percentage of food borne illnesses linked to pork (via Healthline).\nOther concerns causing many to turn away from pork include the ethical abuses associated with industrial pig farming and the environmental costs of mass pork production. Even though rendering animal fat in and of itself isn't necessarily harmful to the environment (and can help cut back on waste), high market demand for pig products in general has led to the rise of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations, which are major sources of toxic pollution and waste (via US News & World Report).\nPlus there are all kinds of healthier alternatives to lard\nNowadays, it's easy to see why lard is such an overlooked or outcast fat. Just roam your local grocery store. There is a whole range of fats and oils to choose from on the shelves, from mainstays like butter, margarine, and olive oil to a variety of nut and seed oils that get the job done.\nThanks to our crazed rebellion against all things fat in the latter half of the 20th century, America has seen an explosion in supposedly healthier fat alternatives (via PhillyMag.com) \u2014 arguably none more pervasive than olive oil, which has become an American household staple since the 1980s (per Washington Post, New York Times).\nToday, the American Heart Association recommends using the following common cooking oils, which they say are better for your health (in alphabetical order, not any sort of ranking): canola, corn, olive, peanut, safflower, soybean, and sunflower.\nBut lard is definitely making a comeback in kitchens today\nAs with many come-and-go trends in our diet and food culture, lard is starting to have a full circle moment. The San Francisco Chronicle explained in 2012 that \"cooks seeking flavor, farmers advocating a return to more sustainable ways of raising animals and science's shifting thinking on dietary health are all helping to rehabilitate\" lard's reputation and place in our food culture.\nThere is no denying lard has started making a comeback in our kitchens, thanks in part to renewed attention from chefs and foodies. It also helps that newer research has shown that lard may actually be better for your health than butter, containing more good fats and less bad fats than the dairy standard we so often turn to (via The Independent).\nThese days, the once maligned fat is garnering headlines like this one from The Daily Meal: \"5 Reasons Why Lard Is the New Coconut Oil.\" Lard is being appreciated once again for its \"versatility in the kitchen,\" (per Country Living). It's apparently the secret ingredient your gumbo is missing, as well was your biscuits, and it has a magical ability to create light and flaky pie crusts. And if you are interested in giving this old-school ingredient a try, there is no shortage of lard recipes all over the internet to lend some inspiration."

      "text": "On September 17, 2024, the Tupperware Brands Corporation announced it had begun the process of filing a Chapter 11 reorganization bankruptcy. \"Over the last several years, the Company's financial position has been severely impacted by the challenging macroeconomic environment,\" Laurie Ann Goldman, president and CEO of Tupperware, said in a press release. \"As a result, we explored numerous strategic options and determined this is the best path forward.\"\nTupperware wants to continue to service its customers and retailers, give its workers their wages and benefits, and pay suppliers and vendors, so it's looking for court approval on these proceedings. To protect what's left of the fallen container empire, the company also wants to sell the business with the goal of advancing Tupperware's modernization, which it has reportedly already made progress on. \"This process is meant to provide us with essential flexibility as we pursue strategic alternatives to support our transformation into a digital-first, technology-led company better positioned to serve our stakeholders,\" Goldman explained.\nRead more: The Most Useless Cooking Utensils, According To Chefs\nWith So Many Options, Shoppers No Longer Need Nostalgia\nThe company managed to avoid bankruptcy last year, after it announced a plan to restructure and reallocate its debt. Yet, this plan didn't carry Tupperware for very long.\nTupperware is so iconic that the brand name is practically a synecdoche for all food storage containers. (If you're wondering what a synecdoche is, think of how \"Kleenex\" is often used to refer to any facial tissue when it's actually a specific brand.) Tupperware became a household product in the 1950s and '60s when homemakers began to sell the containers at house parties known as \"Tupperware parties.\" Tupperware wasn't sold in stores for the longest time because this sales plan worked so well, and it also contributed to the nostalgia of the product. It was not until 2022 that Tupperware finally became available at Target in an attempt to assimilate into the retail market. Yet, there are always cheaper options to be found on the shelves.\nTupperware best serves its customers when it lasts a long time and there's no need to constantly buy more. The containers can last even longer when you try the best ways to remove odors from your Tupperware, like rubbing it with baking soda or rinsing it out with lemon juice. After all, now may be a better time than ever to preserve the family Tupperware inventory.\nRead the original article on Mashed."

      "text": "Abstract\nBackground\nWhile US home cooking declined in the late twentieth century, it is unclear whether the trend has continued. This study examines home cooking from 2003 to 2016 by gender, educational attainment, and race/ethnicity.\nMethods\nNationally representative data from the American Time Use Study from 2003 to 2016 and linear regression models were used to examine changes in the percent of adults aged 18\u201365 years who cook and their time spent cooking, with interactions to test for differential changes by demographic variables of gender, education, and race/ethnicity.\nResults\nCooking increased overall from 2003 to 2016. The percent of college-educated men cooking increased from 37.9% in 2003 to 51.9% in 2016, but men with less than high school education who cook did not change (33.2% in 2016) (p < 0.05). College-educated women who cook increased from 64.7% in 2003 to 68.7% in 2016, while women with less than high school education had no change (72.3% in 2016) (p < 0.05). Women with less education spent more time cooking per day than high-educated women, but the reverse was true for men. Among men, the percent who cook increased for all race/ethnic groups except non-Hispanic blacks. Among women, only non-Hispanic whites increased in percent who cook. Among both men and women, non-Hispanic blacks had the lowest percentage who cooked, and non-Hispanic others spent the greatest amount of time cooking.\nConclusions\nHome cooking in the United States is increasing, especially among men, though women still cook much more than men. Further research is needed to understand whether the heterogeneity in home cooking by educational attainment and race/ethnicity observed here contributes to diet-related disparities in the United States.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nBackground\nIn recent years, scholars [1] and celebrities alike [2, 3] have called for a return to home cooking as a key strategy to improve dietary intake and prevent obesity. Growing, but limited, evidence suggests that cooking from scratch has many benefits. Intervention studies on improving cooking skills have shown increased cooking confidence, frequency of cooking, and intake of fruits and vegetables [4,5,6]. Other studies have also shown that cooking skill is associated with lower intakes of ultra-processed food, convenience food, and take-away food [7, 8]. In addition, a recent systematic review found that increased home cooking is associated with overall healthier dietary patterns [9], though authors noted that many studies on cooking are observational and thus required stronger evidence.\nDespite the potential benefits of home cooking on dietary intake, overall cooking levels in the US declined in the second half of the twentieth century and early years of the twenty first century [10], with increased food costs, decreased time availability, and lack of skill noted as key factors [11,12,13]. Though these barriers seem to have persisted through the last decade, interest in cooking for leisure or entertainment has increased dramatically. This is evident in the increasing popularity of food-related media such as food-focused television channels [14], celebrity chefs [15, 16], food magazines, cookbooks, and blogs, as well as digital [17] and social media [18] and smartphone applications focused on cooking [17], suggesting changes in social norms and values around cooking [19]. Thus, one question is whether the decades-long decline in home cooking has continued, or whether it has begun to plateau or even reverse.\nA second question is who does the home cooking. While women have traditionally been the predominant food shoppers and preparers [20], some evidence suggests this is beginning to shift, with men taking an increasing role [10]. It is also important to understand whether trends in home cooking differ by education level or race/ethnicity, as individuals of lower socio-economic status and racial/ethnic minorities are more likely to have poorer diet quality and suffer from diet-related diseases such as obesity and type 2 diabetes [21,22,23].\nThe objective of this study was to describe trends in the percent of individuals who cooked as well as the amount of time spent cooking (min/capita/day) from 2003 to 2016 using nationally representative data on time use, by gender, education level, and race/ethnicity.\nMethods\nThis study analyzed public-use data from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) with no personally identifiable information. No institutional review board approval was required.\nDetails on the ATUS have been published extensively [24]. Data were downloaded from the ATUS Extract Builder Database in 2017 (https://www.atusdata.org/atus/) and are publicly available [25]. ATUS has been conducted annually by the US Census Bureau since 2003, with the goal to develop nationally representative estimates of time use for Americans. The sample consists of randomly selected households who have completed their final interview in the Current Population Survey. Within each household, one individual over age 15 is randomly selected to participate. Computer-assisted telephone interviews probe respondents on time use during the previous 24-h period. Participants report activities and the duration of activities, which are then coded by ATUS staff into activity types using the ATUS Activity Coding Lexicon, which is a three-tiered classification system [26]. The current analysis includes pooled data from 2003 to 2016 for adults aged 18 to 65 years on non-holidays. Outliers were excluded for reported cooking time (> 8.5 h/day), representing the top 0.1% of the distribution. The final analytical sample included 139,219 respondents.\nOutcome measures\nIn this study, \u201chome cooking\u201d refers to the sum of reported time spent in all activities that were categorized as food and drink preparation (e.g., baking, cooking, broiling, boiling; packing lunches; heating up food), food presentation (setting the table, filling salt and pepper shakers, serving the meal), kitchen and food clean-up (e.g., clearing the table, washing dishes, storing leftovers), and other food preparation activities not otherwise specified.\nExplanatory measures\nCovariates included survey year, respondents\u2019 gender, age, race/ethnicity, educational level, employment status, and marital status, and presence of one or more children under 18 years of age. Gender was self-reported as male or female. Race/ethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or other. As in previous work [27], age was categorized into three groups to reflect progression from early adulthood to retirement ages: 18\u201329 years, 30\u201344 years, or 45\u201365 years. Education was also categorized into three groups: less than high school, high school degree or some college, or college degree or higher. Employment status was defined as: not in the labor force (retired, unemployed, or other), part-time (< 35 h/week), or full-time (\u226535 h/week). Marital status was defined as either married (having a spouse or unmarried partner) or single.\nStatistical analysis\nStata version 14.2 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) was used for all statistical analyses. All analyses were weighted to be nationally representative.\nDescriptive statistics (proportions testing or t-tests) were used to examine changes in the proportion of respondents who reported home cooking and mean time spent home cooking from 2003 to 2016 (min/per capita/day), by socio-demographic characteristics.\nLinear regression models were used to examine changes in the adjusted predicted proportion of respondents who home cooked and the mean per capita time spent cooking from 2003 to 2016, controlling for gender, age, race/ethnicity, education level, employment status, marital status, and presence of children <18y. Each covariate was included as a set of indicator variables to allow for non-linear associations. Due to the high prevalence of individuals who reported no cooking, a two-part model was used to estimate the adjusted mean time spent cooking. Separate models were used to test the interaction between gender, education, and year as well as gender, race/ethnicity, and year in order to examine whether changes in home cooking over time were different for men and women of by educational levels or race/ethnicities. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine the trends in the time spent in cooking among only those who reported cooking. Wald chunk test were used to determine the statistical significance of each interaction. The margins command in Stata was used to estimate adjusted predicted proportions who cooked or mean time spent cooking. P-values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nResults\nTable 1 shows descriptive changes in the percent who cooked at home and the mean time spent cooking by socio-demographic variables in 2003 and 2016. The percent of men who home cooked increased more from 2003 to 2016 than for women (+ 9% vs. + 3%, respectively), although a greater percent of women still cooked in 2016 than did men (70% vs. 46%). While the mean per capita time spent cooking increased over time for both men and women, women cooked for a much greater amount of time than did men (50 min/capita/day vs. 20 min/capita/day).\nThere were not marked differences in the percent who cooked by race/ethnicity in 2003 or 2016. The Non-Hispanic other group showed the greatest change in amount of time spent cooking and in 2016 spent the most time cooking of any race/ethnic group. Those who were older (26\u201340 or 41\u201365), married, not in the labor force, or who had at least one child < 18 were more likely to cook and cooked for a greater amount of time, and this remained consistent over time.\nWhen considering adjusted models, men saw larger increases in the percent who cooked from 2003 to 2016 than women, with greater changes among men with more education (p < 0.01 for interaction) (Fig. 1). In 2016, 10.8% more men with a high school degree or some college and 14.0% more men with a college degree cooked compared to 2003 (p < 0.01 for both comparisons), whereas there was no change in the percent of men without a high school degree who cooked. For women, the increase in the percent cooking from 2003 to 2016 was smaller (4.1% for both women with a high school degree or some college and women with a college degree, no change for women without a high school degree). However, the overall percent of women who cooked was much higher and less variable by education level than it was for men.\nThere was also heterogeneity by gender and education with regards to changes in time spent cooking in 2003 versus 2016 (p < 0.01 for interaction) (Fig. 2). Among men, those with college degrees increased mean cooking time the most (+ 8.4 min/capita/day, p < 0.01), followed by men with a high school degree or some college (+ 5.2 min/capita/day, p < 0.01). Men without a high school degree actually decreased mean time spent cooking (\u2212 5.9 min/capita/day, p < 0.05) heightening the disparity in time men spent cooking by education level in 2016. Among women, only those with a high school degree or some college significantly changed the amount of time spent cooking between 2003 and 2016 (+ 3.9 min/capita/day, p < 0.05).\nPercent who cooked and mean time spent cooking differed by race/ethnicity (p < 0.01 for both interactions) (Figs. 3 and 4). Among men, non-Hispanic others showed the largest increase from 2003 to 2016 in the percent who cooked (+ 16.4%), followed by non-Hispanic whites (+ 12.0%), and Hispanics (+ 10.4%) (p < 0.01 for each comparison). Non-Hispanic black men saw no significant change in percent who cooked from 2003 to 2016. As a result, by 2016, there was substantial heterogeneity in the percent of men who cooked by race/ethnicity, with about half of non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic other men cooking, 42% of Hispanic men cooking, and only 37% of non-Hispanic black men cooking. Figure 4 shows that non-Hispanic other men also showed the biggest increase in mean time spent cooking (+ 13.7 min/day, p < 0.01), followed by non-Hispanic white (+ 6.2 min/capita/day, p < 0.01) and Hispanic men (+ 4.2 min/ capita/day, p < 0.01), whereas non-Hispanic black men had no significant change from 2003 to 2016.\nAmong women, on the other hand, only non-Hispanic white women showed increases in the percent who cooked (+ 3.6%, p < 0.05) from 2003 to 2016, although Hispanic and non-Hispanic women had the highest percent of women who cooked across all time periods (68\u201375%), while the smallest percent of black women cooked across time. With regards to time spent cooking, non-Hispanic other women showed the biggest increase from 2003 to 2016 (+ 15.5 min/capita/day, p < 0.05), and non-Hispanic black women also increased (+ 7.2 min//capita/day, p < 0.05), whereas non-Hispanic white women and Hispanic women showed no change. As a result, in 2016, non-Hispanic other and Hispanic women reported the highest mean time spent cooking (62.3 and 67.9 min/capita/day, respectively), whereas non-Hispanic white and black women reported lower mean time spent cooking (42.0 and 45.7 min/capita/day, respectively).\nResults of the sensitivity analyses examining trends in time spent cooking only amongst those who cooked can be found in Appendix. Differences over time by gender, education, and race/ethnicity tended to be in the same direction and magnitude as the per capita estimates, but changes over time were less likely to be statistically significant.\nDiscussion\nThis study finds that home cooking in the United States appears to be on the rise, both in terms of the percent of the US population who cooks and \u2014 except for men with less than high school education \u2014 the amount of time spent cooking. For men, this continues the trend towards increased home cooking. A previous study found that the percent of men who cooked increased from 29% in 1965 to 42% in 2007 [10], and current results show a further increase to 46% in 2016. For women, these findings indicate a leveling off or even a reversal of previous trends, as the percent of women who cooked decreased from 92% in 1965 to 68% in 2007 [10], but rebounded slightly to 70% in 2016.\nGender\nThe increase in men\u2019s cooking found here mirrors trends in Europe, where research from four Nordic countries found increases from 1997 to 2012 in the percent of men cooking, particularly those from the working and upper classes [28]. Even in 2016, however, US males\u2019 cooking levels were still lower than in the United Kingdom a decade earlier, when a 2005 time use survey showed 60% of men (and 85% of women) in the United Kingdom cooked over one 24-h period [29]. It is unclear what accounts for this increase in US males\u2019 home cooking, although one possibility is that the rise in popularity of food-related media has disproportionately influenced men. For example, one study found that watching cooking programs was associated with more cooking only among men [30], though additional research has found that only 28% of adults learned to cook by watching cooking shows (with no difference by gender) [19]. Others suggest that popular celebrity chefs such as Jamie Oliver have presented cooking as a masculine activity [31], potentially making it more appealing to males. At the same time, this masculinization seems to have arisen as part of \u201cfoodie culture,\u201d or the treatment of cooking as a form of leisure or entertainment rather than labor [31,32,33].\nOf course, having the time, money, and skill to cook as a luxury rather than a necessity is likely only possible for the middle- or upper-class. This could explain why the current study found increases in cooking only for middle- or higher-educated men, but no change for lower educated men. Increased enjoyment from cooking for men could also have contributed to increased cooking levels, as enjoyment of cooking has been linked to more cooking [34]. Interestingly, cooking research from the UK and France shows that socio-economic factors are unrelated to time spent cooking for men [29, 35].\nDespite their greater increases in home cooking over time, men still lag behind women in terms of the percent who cook and time spent cooking, suggesting that women remain the primary home food preparers in the United States. The reason for the small increases in women\u2019s home cooking, which mark a reversal of previous trends, and continued relatively high levels of cooking is not entirely clear. One possibility is that women \u2014 or at least some women \u2014 have more time available for cooking due to small declines in time spent working. Women\u2019s labor force participation, which increased in the United States during the second half of the twentieth century, has actually fallen by about 3.5 percentage points since 2000 [36]. Less time spent in the labor force could increase time available for home cooking, which has been well-documented as a major barrier to home food preparation [11, 37, 38]. Plateaus or increases in women\u2019s cooking time could also reflect fewer new advances in time-saving technology in the kitchen (e.g., microwaves, food processors, dishwasher) over recent years compared to the late twentieth century. In addition, strong social norms likely persist around gender and cooking: women and girls are more likely to be involved in cooking, feel confident in cooking, and pass down cooking skills to children [9]. Additional evidence shows that cooking skills and mealtime practices in general also tend to be transferred from mothers to daughters [39, 40], further propagating this norm.\nEducation level\nThere was substantial heterogeneity in cooking trends by education level. This was especially pronounced for men: while the percent of men with high school/some college and college degrees who cooked increased to 47.0% and 51.9%, respectively, the percent of men with less than a high school degree who cooked remained low (about a third). A similar trend was observed in time spent cooking, with more educated men increasing cooking time from 2003 to 2016, while those with less than a high school degree decreasing cooking time. More cooking among higher-educated men is consistent with evidence showing that higher education is associated with more egalitarian ideas about gender roles, including more equitable distributions of household labor [41]. Among men with less education, lower cooking prevalence and time spent cooking suggests greater reliance on away-from-home foods such as fast food or restaurant food, or more frequent use of foods that are faster to prepare, such as ready-to-heat and ready-to-eat convenience foods. This could be problematic for diet quality and health, as highly processed convenience foods tend to be energy-dense and contain higher levels of added sugar, saturated fat, and sodium [42,43,44], whereas more time spent on cooking is associated with higher intakes of beneficial foods such as vegetables, salads, and fruits [45].\nAmong women, this difference was reversed: women with less than a high school education were more likely to cook and cooked for longer than those with higher levels of education. This contrasts with findings from a previous study using the National Health and Nutrition Survey, which found no association between education and likelihood of being the main meal planner or preparer [46]. That study, however, asked respondents only about their status as the \u201cmain\u201d meal preparer and not about their likelihood to cook or the amount of time they spent cooking. Interestingly, the present study found no increase in either measure of cooking for low-educated women from 2003 to 2016. This is somewhat surprising, given that economic changes such as the Great Recession, increases in food prices, and wage stagnation might suggest greater increases in cooking as people trade time to save money. These findings are consistent, however, with those in a previous study, which found that low socio-economic status households (as measured by the poverty rate) did not alter cooking patterns in response to the Great Recession [27].\nIt is worth noting that more cooking does not necessarily equate to more healthful cooking. Some studies have shown that low-socio-economic households have lower levels of confidence in cooking from scratch or cooking with vegetables [13, 47], and may be likely to rely on ready-to-eat meals or frozen convenience foods or fried foods. Research has shown that people in low-income/low-access neighborhoods have noted food affordability \u2014 particularly for fresh produce and other basic ingredients \u2014 as major barrier to buying and preparing healthier foods [34]. In fact, one recent study found that women who spent more time preparing meals actually had greater risk of metabolic syndrome [48]. While the current work describes trends in home cooking, more research is needed to link these shifts in dietary behaviors to changes in dietary intake and downstream effects on obesity and cardio-metabolic risk.\nRace/ethnicity\nThere was a high level of heterogeneity in home cooking by race/ethnicity, as well, particularly for men. While non-Hispanic other men had the greatest increase in percent who cooked, a similarly high percent of white men cooked in 2016, followed by Hispanic men, and these trends were consistent for amount of time spent cooking. Non-Hispanic black men were the only race/ethnic group that did not increase cooking time from 2003 to 2016, and in 2016 spent the least time cooking of any group. For women, on the other hand, both the relative change over time as well as absolute differences between race/ethnic groups were much smaller with regards to the percent cooking, though again, non-Hispanic blacks had the lowest levels. However, non-Hispanic white women spent the least amount of time cooking in 2016, followed closely by black women, and Hispanic and non-Hispanic other women spent substantially more time cooking (> 20 min/day compared to non-Hispanic whites). The low level of cooking among non-Hispanic black men and women as well as higher levels of cooking among Hispanics is consistent with previous findings [49].\nOne question for future study is how amount of cooking interacts with ingredients and methods used to influence dietary intake and downstream health effects, as there is likely great heterogeneity in these aspects of cooking behavior as well. For example, previous research has shown that ethnicity and culture influence the ingredients used, such as the use of fresh or frozen food vs. more processed food and canned goods [50]. Other research has shown that the non-Hispanic black families may be more likely to use high levels of sugar, salt, and fat as well as less-healthy cooking methods like frying [51,52,53]. Given this study\u2019s findings on relatively low levels of cooking among black men and women, more research into home food preparation in black households may be useful to understand how cooking (or lack thereof) might contribute to diet-related health disparities for black Americans.\nLimitations\nThis study has several limitations. First, it was not possible to examine changes in home cooking by income level due to the high level of missingness on this variable in the data. Educational attainment serves as a useful proxy for socio-economic status, has been validated as a predictor of cardiovascular risk [54], and may relate to a household\u2019s food and nutrition-related knowledge and skill. Income plays a related but distinct role, as financial resources \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 can limit the types of foods households can buy, whether single ingredients to cook from scratch, processed prepared foods, or foods purchased and eaten away from home. For example, research has shown that energy-dense diets high in refined grains, added sugar, and added fat cost less than fresh fruits and vegetables, meats, and fish [55], suggesting that the cost of basic ingredients (and thus home cooking) might pose an important barrier to lower-income households beyond other education-related barriers. Secondly, the time-use data is limited only to activities reported by a single individual on a single day. Thus, just because a respondent does not spend time themselves in home food preparation does not necessarily mean they are not consuming home-prepared food, either as leftovers or prepared for them by someone else. It is unclear whether dietary value differs for consuming self-prepared foods vs. consuming home-prepared food made by someone else.\nOne strength of the current study is that participants report all the activities in which they participated, which are then coded as \u201chome food preparation\u201d (or another activity) by ATUS coders. This coding structure avoids potential problems associated with variation in perceptions of what counts as home cooking by gender, education, or race/ethnicity (i.e., what one person counts as cooking, another person might not). However, the measure of home cooking used in this study does represent multiple aspects of the cooking process, from setting the table through cooking and clean-up, as well as varying levels of cooking, from simply microwaving a ready-to-eat snack to assembling several pre-prepared items to preparing an entire meal from scratch. While time spent cooking can be considered a proxy for level of cooking effort (with more time likely reflecting a more intensive preparation process or greater likelihood of being \u201cfrom scratch\u201d), it is not possible to examine this level of detail in the current study. Future research will be needed to understand which aspects of the cooking process and what level of cooking are important for better diet and health outcomes.\nConclusions\nHome cooking in the United States increased from 2003 to 2016, with greater increases among men, although women remain more likely to cook and to cook for more time. There was substantial heterogeneity in cooking behaviors by education level and race/ethnicity, with lower-educated men, higher-educated women, and non-Hispanic black men and women less likely to cook at home. These differences by education and race/ethnicity suggest that programs or policies seeking to improve diet through increased cooking may achieve the biggest gains in these sub-populations.\nAbbreviations\n- ATUS:\n-\nAmerican Time Use Survey\nReferences\nLichtenstein AH, Ludwig DS.

      "text": "Easy Cheese Fondue Recipe\nWho knew you could make your own cheese fondue at home? This fun appetizer only requires a handful of ingredients and comes together in under 30 minutes, making it ideal for serving to party guests. This recipe utilizes both Swiss and Gouda cheeses for a pairing of both sharp and nutty flavors. Trust us, once you taste this homemade fondue, you'll never buy storebought again.\nRecipe developer and registered dietitian nutritionist, Kristen Carli, MS, RD, brings us this recipe. Carli recommends using this fondue as a way to get children (and adults) to eat more veggies. Let's face it: Nothing tastes bad dipped in cheese. If you are trying to increase your vegetable consumption, cheese fondue is the ticket. Carli recommends serving this up with some sliced bell peppers, celery sticks, grape tomatoes, and cubed bread. Now, dive right in and follow our step-by-step guide to make this cheese fondue at home.\nGather your ingredients for this easy cheese fondue recipe\nTo make this easy cheese fondue, you can start by gathering your ingredients. For this recipe, you will need Swiss cheese, Gouda cheese, salt, pepper, white wine, brandy, yellow mustard, minced garlic, and lemon juice.\nShred Swiss and Gouda cheese\nThe first step is a full-blown arm workout. You need to shred both the Swiss and the Gouda cheese with a cheese grater. While you could buy pre-shredded cheese, it is not recommended. Because the store-bought pre-shredded cheeses are a bit more difficult to melt, you will get better results if you shred them yourself.\nAdd wine, brandy, mustard, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and pepper\nNext, add the wine, brandy, mustard, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and pepper to a large pot. Place this pot on the stove top over high heat and bring it to a boil. Using a whisk, mix in the mustard so that it is combined. Once this mixture is boiling, you can proceed to the next step.\nGradually sprinkle in the cheeses\nNow, it is time to add the cheese. But before you go dumping in all of the cheese at once, it's best to add a handful at a time. Once the cheese is warm and melted, you can then add more cheese. This gradual process should take about 10 minutes until all of the cheese has been added and melted. Then, put the fondue in a serving dish and pair it with cubed bread and assorted vegetables for dipping.\nElassic Cheese Fondue Recipe\nPair this easy cheese fondue recipe with your favorite vegetables and bread for a delicious snack that your friends and family will love to share with you.\nIngredients\n- 1 pound of Swiss cheese\n- 1 pound Gouda cheese\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n- \u00bd teaspoon pepper\n- \u00bd cup white wine\n- 2 tablespoons brandy\n- 2 tablespoons yellow mustard\n- 1 tablespoon minced garlic\n- \u00bc cup lemon juice\nDirections\n- Shred the cheeses.\n- In a large pot, add the wine, brandy, mustard, lemon juice, garlic, salt, and pepper.\n- Bring to a boil, whisking the mustard to incorporate.\n- Slowly add the cheeses, making sure to keep stirring. Once melted, add more cheese. Stir until melted, and repeat.\n- Once all the cheese is melted, pour it into a serving dish. Serve with skewers, cubed bread, and assorted veggies for dipping.\nNutrition\n| Calories per Serving | 355 |\n| Total Fat | 25.2 g |\n| Saturated Fat | 16.1 g |\n| Trans Fat | 0.0 g |\n| Cholesterol | 93.4 mg |\n| Total Carbohydrates | 4.7 g |\n| Dietary Fiber | 0.2 g |\n| Total Sugars | 1.9 g |\n| Sodium | 438.5 mg |\n| Protein | 23.7 g |"

      "text": "The Humble Midwest Origins Of Supper Clubs\nSupper clubs seem like a charming relic of the mid-20th century, and one with which you may not be familiar if you were not born before the baby boom. Back in the day, supper clubs could be pretty swanky, complete with fine dining and dancing to live orchestra music. The first such establishment opened in Beverly Hills, of course, as the city seemed the epitome of elegance and the capital of all things chi-chi back in the 1930s.\nInterestingly enough, the man who opened the first supper club was not a Californian but hailed from the Upper Midwestern. Nearly a century later, Milwaukee claims Lawrence Frank as one of its most prominent native sons and proudly points to his other accomplishments including introducing the salad bar, surf-and-turf, and to-go bags for restaurant leftovers. You might even find one of Frank's innovations in your spice cabinet, as Lawry's Seasoned Salt was created to spice up the prime rib that the earliest supper club served up for the princely sum of $1.25 (although you did get a baked potato, Yorkshire pudding, and salad as well).\nLawry's salt and supper club concept both caught on and went mid-century viral, although the latter eventually went the way of the black-and-white snapshots in which its memory is enshrined. It's hard to pinpoint an exact date for the end of the supper club era, but many modern-day recollections of these are heavily nostalgia-tinged and rely on memories of parents and grandparents to bring back bygone days.\nSupper clubs are alive and well in Wisconsin\nThe supper club tradition hasn't entirely died out, however. While a few outposts still stand in spots such as NYC's Rainbow Room (which probably deserves the descriptor \"iconic,\" although we're trying to cut down on its use) and San Francisco's upstart Lazy Bear, genuine old-time supper clubs, as well as more modern ones, still thrive in the Badger State. Wisconsin is used to being an outlier in many ways, not just geographically, as it's also the one state where brandy is the preferred tipple and Old Fashioneds are sweet or sour and oh-so-fruity.\nMany Wisconsin supper clubs in the 20th century started as glorified speakeasies and some were even patronized by gangsters on the lam (Chicago's just hours away), with Manitowish Waters' Little Bohemia Lodge still known for the bullet holes in its walls. Today's typical small-town Wisconsin supper club tends to be a gathering spot where people may meet up after mass, perhaps for brunch (or dinner, if it's Saturday afternoon mass) and maybe a game of cards. In cities, too, supper clubs still draw quite a crowd and it's rather appropriate that Milwaukee, home to the original supper club creator, boasts quite a few such establishments. Whether urban or rural, supper clubs live up to the name in that they tend to be social hubs, albeit ones that don't charge membership fees above and beyond the price of a meal with perhaps a pink squirrel or grasshopper to follow"

      "text": "Fruit Cake Recipe\nYeah, yeah, fruit cake gets a bad wrap. It's the butt of far too many jokes, regarded as the dish that's always left untouched on the holiday table, as able to withstand a nuclear blast ... and the list goes on. But hey, have you ever actually eaten fruit cake? Like a fresh, homemade fruit cake featuring six different types of dried fruit, almost an entire cup of dark rum, a stick of butter, a bunch of brown sugar, spices, and more? Whatever be the case, our fruit cake recipe is sure to change your perspective on this misunderstood dessert.\n\"Fruit cake is delicious,\" says chef, food writer, and registered dietician Kristen Carli of Camelback Nutrition & Wellness. \"It's packed with many different dried fruits providing sweetness and texture.\" She adds, \"I love pairing this with ice cream,\" which only sweetens the deal.\nEasy to make, filling and satisfying, and yes, safe to store for multiple days even at room temperature, once you try this fruit cake recipe, you'll think of it as the life of the party rather than the butt of a joke. Okay, maybe that's overselling it just a little bit. How about we say it's a tasty dessert by which everyone will be pleasantly surprised.\nGather your ingredients for fruit cake\nThis fruit cake recipe calls for a lot of ingredients \u2014 19, in fact. They include 2 \u00bd cups of raisins, 1 cup of dried apricots (chopped), 1 cup of dried cranberries, 1 cup of dried figs (chopped), 1 cup of dried cherries, 1 cup of dried prunes (chopped), \u00be cup of dark rum, 1 \u00bd cups of all-purpose flour, \u00bd teaspoon of baking powder, 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of ground ginger, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 stick of unsalted butter, \u00be cup of packed brown sugar, 5 eggs, 1 tablespoon of lemon zest, 1 tablespoon of orange zest, \u00bd cup of orange juice, and \u00be cup of chopped pecans.\nYou'll be just fine to leave out a fruit or two if need be, but if you want Carli's advice, don't skip the figs. \"I particularly love dried figs,\" she says. \"They are so delicious. I made sure to include dried figs in this dish because they are my fave, [and] did you know that dried figs are a great source of calcium?\"\nSoak the fruit in rum overnight, then prep for cooking\nMake sure you plan well ahead for your fruit cake, because the first step takes an entire day. Prepare the fruit soak by combining all of the dried fruit in a large mixing bowl, and then adding the rum. Level the fruit so it is as submerged as possible, then cover the bowl with a lid and allow things to soak at room temperature for 24 hours.\nWhen a day has passed, preheat the oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit and then spray two 8x4-inch loaf pans with nonstick cooking spray.\nMix your non-fruit ingredients\nIn a medium bowl, add the flour, baking powder, salt, and spices, and whisk them all together until they are well combined. Then, in the bowl of a stand mixer, add the softened butter and brown sugar, and mix at high speed with the paddle attachment for three minutes to fully combine the two.\nReduce the speed to low, and add the eggs to the mixer bowl one at a time. Then, with the stand mixer on medium, add the flour gradually until all of the ingredients have combined into a smooth mixture.\nAdd the fruit, and bake the cakes\nTurn off the mixer and add in the soaked fruit mixture. Then, add the lemon zest, orange zest, and orange juice. Lastly, add the pecans and stir everything well to combine. The batter will be heavy and thick.\nPour (or perhaps scoop, if need be) the fruit batter evenly into the two prepared loaf pans and smooth it out so it's level, and then bake the fruit cakes for 1 hour and 15 minutes.\nOnce removed from the oven, let the cakes cool, and then serve and enjoy. Or, save them for a bit. \"They will keep for up to seven days in an airtight plastic bag at room temperature,\" says Carli.\nFruit cake your family will ask for again and again\nOur tasty fruit cake recipe is jam-packed with a variety of dried fruits and pairs so well with vanilla ice cream.\nIngredients\n- 2 \u00bd cups raisins\n- 1 cup dried apricots, chopped\n- 1 cup dried cranberries\n- 1 cup dried figs, chopped\n- 1 cup dried cherries\n- 1 cup dried prunes, chopped\n- \u00be cup dark rum\n- 1 \u00bd cups all-purpose flour\n- \u00bd teaspoon baking powder\n- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n- 1 teaspoon ground ginger\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n- 1 stick unsalted butter\n- \u00be cup packed brown sugar\n- 5 eggs\n- 1 tablespoon lemon zest\n- 1 tablespoon orange zest\n- \u00bd cup orange juice\n- \u00be cup chopped pecans\nDirections\n- Prepare the fruit soak by combining all of the dried fruit in a large mixing bowl.

      "text": "Easy From-Scratch Flour Tortilla Recipe\nIf you are a fan of flour tortillas, this recipe is right up your alley. Contrary to popular belief, tortillas are easy to make from scratch, and it's really not that much more effort than getting to a store to buy them. That's right \u2014 you don't need to go to a Mexican restaurant to get a perfect tortilla; instead, you can make it in the comfort of your own kitchen. This recipe requires just a few ingredients, and from start to finish, it only takes about 15 minutes to prep and a minute-plus per tortilla to cook.\nRecipe developer Miriam Hahn came up with this fantastic recipe for homemade flour tortillas that would go perfect with tacos, quesadillas, and everything else in-between. \"My favorite thing about this recipe is just how simple it is. I love that you don't need a stand mixer and the ingredients are always on hand,\" Hahn shares. \"Plus, it always tastes better when you can make something from scratch. It is also nice to avoid buying something that is wrapped in plastic.\" Hahn also raves that these are much better than store-bought tortillas because they're \"ultra-fresh.\" After all, who doesn't want a fresh tortilla with their quesadilla?\nGather the ingredients for from-scratch flour tortillas\nKick things off by heading to the store and gathering all the ingredients. You will need all-purpose flour, baking powder, salt, olive or avocado oil, and warm water. Once you have all those items, you can make these easy from-scratch flour tortillas.\nStart by making the dough\nTake out a large bowl to mix everything. First, add the flour, baking powder, and salt. Then, you can add the oil and the warm water. Use a wooden spoon or a Danish whisk to stir. As you continue stirring, the mixture will look dry and shaggy.\nKnead and divide the dough\nPlace a thin layer of flour on a large board and use your hands to knead the dough for about 3 minutes. It should start to transform into a smooth ball. Next, divide the dough into 16 equal portions (or 12 equal portions if you want larger tortillas). Roll each section into a ball, then flatten it with your hands. Lay each dough disc out on a cutting board, then cover them with a dish towel and let them rest for 30 minutes.\nWhen the 30 minutes are up, roll each piece of dough into a 6-inch circle. Continue adding flour to the board as you roll each one as this will prevent the dough from sticking. Stack them on a plate and place a piece of parchment paper between them, so they don't stick together.\nCook the tortillas\nGrab a pan and place it on your stove. Turn the heat to medium-high and add one tortilla at a time. Cook for about a minute on the first side, and then flip over and cook for an additional 40 seconds. Remove the tortilla from the pan and cover it with a clean dishtowel.\nThe first tortilla may take up to 2 minutes to cook since the pan will just be starting to heat up. Watch for the tortilla to bubble and on top, and there should be some brown spots on the bottom.\nServe your fresh, from-scratch tortillas\nThese tortillas are best when enjoyed right away. \"I love serving these with black beans, avocado, tomato, cilantro etc. It is fun to have a Mexican-themed night and have a variety of items to fill them with,\" Hahn shares. \"They are great for fajitas and cheese crisps too. You can also cut them into triangles and make chips. You just brush them lightly with oil and sprinkle on some salt and bake for about 5 minutes at 400 F.\"\nIf you are not using them right away, store the tortillas in a plastic bag. When you are ready to use, be sure to wrap the tortillas in a damp tea towel and microwave for about 20 seconds to reheat. You can also place them in an oven-safe glass pyrex with a lid and heat at 250 F.\nEasy From-Scratch Flour Tortilla Recipe\nSkip the store-bought option and instead opt for these fresh from-scratch flour tortillas.\nIngredients\n- 3 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for kneading and rolling out\n- 1 teaspoon baking powder\n- 1 teaspoon salt\n- \u2153 cup olive or avocado oil\n- 1 cup warm water\nDirections\n- In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt.\n- Add in the oil and warm water. Stir with a wooden spoon or Danish whisk. It will look dry and shaggy.\n- Put a thin layer of flour on a large board and knead by hand for 3 minutes. It will become a smooth ball.\n- Divide the dough into 16 equal portions. (Or you can divide into 12 equal parts for larger tortillas.) Roll each section into a ball and then flatten with your hands. Cover with a dish towel and let rest for 30 minutes.\n- Roll each piece into a 6-inch circle, continuing to add flour to the board as you roll each one. Stack them on a plate with parchment paper between each one.\n- Heat a pan to medium-high heat and lay in one tortilla. Cook for 1 minute, then flip to the other side and cook for 40 seconds. Remove from pan and cover with a clean dish towel, adding finished tortillas as you go. Note that the first tortilla will take up to 2 minutes because the pan is not at it's hottest. Look for the tortilla to bubble before turning, and the underside should have some brown spots.\n- Serve right away or store in an airtight container or Ziploc bag. To reheat, wrap a tortilla in a damp tea towel and put it in the microwave for about 20 seconds. Or place them in an oven safe glass Pyrex with a lid, in a 250 F oven. These will be good for up to 1 week.\nNutrition\n| Calories per Serving | 251 |\n| Total Fat | 9.5 g |\n| Saturated Fat | 1.1 g |\n| Trans Fat | 0.0 |\n| Cholesterol | 0.0 mg |\n| Total Carbohydrates | 35.9 g |\n| Dietary Fiber | 1.3 g |\n| Total Sugars | 0.1 g |\n| Sodium | 200.4 mg |\n| Protein | 4.8 g |"

      "text": "- Research\n- Open access\n- Published:\nTrends in US home food preparation and consumption: analysis of national nutrition surveys and time use studies from 1965\u20131966 to 2007\u20132008\nNutrition Journal volume 12, Article number: 45 (2013)\nAbstract\nBackground\nIt has been well-documented that Americans have shifted towards eating out more and cooking at home less. However, little is known about whether these trends have continued into the 21st century, and whether these trends are consistent amongst low-income individuals, who are increasingly the target of public health programs that promote home cooking. The objective of this study is to examine how patterns of home cooking and home food consumption have changed from 1965 to 2008 by socio-demographic groups.\nMethods\nThis is a cross-sectional analysis of data from 6 nationally representative US dietary surveys and 6 US time-use studies conducted between 1965 and 2008. Subjects are adults aged 19 to 60 years (n= 38,565 for dietary surveys and n=55,424 for time-use surveys). Weighted means of daily energy intake by food source, proportion who cooked, and time spent cooking were analyzed for trends from 1965\u20131966 to 2007\u20132008 by gender and income. T-tests were conducted to determine statistical differences over time.\nResults\nThe percentage of daily energy consumed from home food sources and time spent in food preparation decreased significantly for all socioeconomic groups between 1965\u20131966 and 2007\u20132008 (p \u2264 0.001), with the largest declines occurring between 1965 and 1992. In 2007\u20132008, foods from the home supply accounted for 65 to 72% of total daily energy, with 54 to 57% reporting cooking activities. The low income group showed the greatest decline in the proportion cooking, but consumed more daily energy from home sources and spent more time cooking than high income individuals in 2007\u20132008 (p \u2264 0.001).\nConclusions\nUS adults have decreased consumption of foods from the home supply and reduced time spent cooking since 1965, but this trend appears to have leveled off, with no substantial decrease occurring after the mid-1990\u2019s. Across socioeconomic groups, people consume the majority of daily energy from the home food supply, yet only slightly more than half spend any time cooking on a given day. Efforts to boost the healthfulness of the US diet should focus on promoting the preparation of healthy foods at home while incorporating limits on time available for cooking.\nIntroduction\nAmerican diets have shifted towards decreased nutrient density [1] with less than 20 percent meeting USDA guidelines for a healthy diet, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy [2]. US consumers increasingly consume foods from away-from-home sources including fast food, cafeterias, and restaurants [3\u20137]. In fact, one recent paper showed that for children, half of all energy from fast food is consumed at home [4], demonstrating that even foods consumed within the home are not necessarily home-cooked. Alongside an increase in eating out, people spend less time in food preparation, with an approximate halving of time for women and a small increase for men [8\u201312], a trend which continued into the 21st century [12, 13]. Unsurprisingly, lack of time is reported as a major barrier to preparing nutritious meals [14\u201316], prompting people to \u201cbuy\u201d time through the purchase of convenience foods [17] which are often sold ready-to-eat or requiring minimal preparation. The shift towards increased grazing [18, 19] and snacking [20] also decreases time spent cooking, as people reach for portable pre-packaged snacks instead of eating meals.\nThis well-documented shift towards eating away from home has created a movement to focus on fast food and other chain restaurants as the target of public health initiatives combating obesity. However, few studies have examined whether these trends towards eating out more and cooking less have continued in recent years. There is no evidence to suggest that the trend towards increased away-from-home food consumption should continue indefinitely, and it is possible that US consumers have already reached a peak in terms of how much eat out. A leveling off of this trend could have implications for where efforts for improving the US diet and reducing excess energy intake are directed.\nAlthough concern amongst public health scholars and advocates has often centered on fast food and other away-from-home foods, efforts to boost consumption of healthy home-cooked foods have become increasingly common across the US Programs include the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Healthy Incentives Pilot aimed at increasing purchase of fruits and vegetables and the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Farmer\u2019s Market Nutrition program, which provides coupons for the purchase of locally grown produce [21\u201323]. In both the UK and the US, promotion of home cooking has been viewed as a major strategy to reduce obesity [24\u201328]. However, these initiatives assume that if consumers are able to purchase healthy foods, they can and will prepare them at home. Little is known about how frequently or how much time Americans spend cooking food in the home, especially among demographic groups targeted by these food assistance programs [29\u201331].\nThis study aims to evaluate 1) whether US adults continue to increase away-from-home food consumption or if this trend has leveled off and 2) when people do eat at home, how likely they are to cook and how much time they spend cooking, especially amongst low-income consumers. We examine trends in home food consumption and home food preparation by linking two sets of nationally representative cross-sectional surveys from 1965\u20131966 to 2007\u20132008. Using dietary data, trends in the source of people\u2019s food were examined in relationship to mean total daily energy intake. Time-use surveys were utilized to evaluate changes in time allocation for cooking, as well as to examine the role of gender and income.\nData and methods\nDietary data\nThis study used data on 38,565 individuals aged 19 to 60 years from 6 nationally representative cross-sectional nutrition surveys: 4,114 participants from the 1965\u20131966 Household Food Consumption Survey (HFCS); 12,935 participants from the 1977\u20131978 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (NFCS); 7,750 participants from the 1989\u20131991 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CSFII); 6,894 participants from the 1994\u20131996 CSFII; 3,138 participants from the 2003\u20132004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES); and 3,734 participants from the 2007\u20132008 NHANES (Table 1). Detailed methodology pertaining to each survey has been published previously [32\u201337]. We utilize the first day of dietary recall to provide comparable measures over the full time period studied.\nCategorization of food intake\nFor all diet surveys, the proportion of energy consumed from home and away food sources for adults was determined using food source and eating location variables. Because this study is concerned primarily with the source of food rather than where the food was eaten, location of consumption is considered only when it is difficult to ascertain the source of food without additional information. To allow comparability across surveys, \u201chome\u201d food sources include any food that is designated as purchased from a store, convenience store, or grocery/deli [4]. Lack of information, including whether food from the store was prepared at home or fully prepared at the store, limited analysis of this component. Foods that were not from the home or the store were considered as away-from-home food sources, including schools, cafeterias, restaurants, and fast food. The proportion of daily energy consumed from home sources was calculated for each participant.\nParticipants were excluded if the energy content of a food or the source of an energy-containing food was missing. Of participants with dietary and demographic data, the percentage of participants excluded are 10% in 1965\u20131966 HFCS, 3.2% in 1977\u20131978 NCFS, 0.6% in the 1989\u20131991 CSFII, 1.8% in the 1994\u20131996 CSFII, 0.3% in 2003\u20132004 NHANES, and 0.2% in the 2007\u20132008 NHANES.\nTime use data\nThe American Heritage Time Use Study is a cross-national harmonized dataset of time-use surveys with identically recoded variables [38]. The present study utilizes data on 55,424 adults aged 19 to 60 years from 6 time use studies of US adults: 1,888 participants from the 1965\u20131966 Multinational Comparative Time-Budget Research Project (MCTRP); 3,190 participants from the 1975\u20131976 American\u2019s Use of Time Project (AUTP); 2,391 participants from the 1985 AUTP; 5,395 from the 1992\u20131994 National Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS) and 896 from the 1994\u20131995 National Time-Diary Study (NTDS); 24,382 from the 2003\u20132004 American Time Use Study (ATUS) and 17,282 from the 2007\u20132008 ATUS (Table 1). Participants from the 1992\u20131994 NHAPS and the 1995\u20131995 NTDS were pooled for analysis due to overlapping time periods (n=6,291). The analysis sample was restricted to adults aged 19 to 60 to capture adults during prime working ages and to exclude retirees.\nThe methodological details of these studies have been published previously [39]. All surveys were weighted to balance the distribution of age and sex groups in relation to the Census distribution at the relevant time and to provide an even distribution of days of the week [40].\nCoding and categorization of time use diaries\nDiaries were excluded if they did not meet any of the following criteria: 1) had \u226591 min of main activity time after imputation, 2) had \u2265 seven time episodes, 3) included \u2265 two of four basic activities (sleep/rest, eating/drinking, personal care, and travel/exercise), or 4) included information on age and sex. Of respondents age 19 to 60 years, 0.1% were excluded in the 1965\u20131966 MCTRP, 2.2% in the 1975\u20131976 AUT, 1.6% in the 1985\u20131986 AUT, 3.1% in the 1992\u20131995 NHAPS/NTDS, 2.8% in the 2003\u20132004 ATUS, and 2.6% in the 2007\u20132008 ATUS.\nTime spent in food preparation was the sum of time spent preparing food and cleaning up after food preparation. If a participant reported >0 min of time spent in food preparation or food-related cleaning activity, they were considered to have prepared food.\nThis study analyzed public use data with no personally identifiable information. No institutional review board review was required. Consent was obtained for all participants by the institutions initially responsible for collecting the data.\nStatistical analysis\nDemographic variables considered in the analysis included gender, age group, and income level. In the food intake analysis, income was categorized into low, middle, and high income groups if the ratio of family income to poverty was \u2264130%, 130% to 300%, and \u2265 300%, respectively. In the time use analysis, income reflects the annual household income recorded in quantiles: lowest 25%, middle 50%, and highest 25%. No continuous income data was available in the time use data set, precluding categorization of income into groups based on family income to poverty for this part of the analysis. Statistical analysis was conducted in 2011 and performed using Stata (Version 12, 2012, StataCorp, College Station, TX). Using survey commands to account for survey design and adjust results to be nationally representative, t-tests were conducted to test differences between ratios of the means for each survey year with a two-sided significance level of \u22640.01.\nResults\nDemographic characteristics of participants in the nutrition and time use surveys are presented in Table 1.\nEnergy intake by food source\nTotal energy intake and energy consumed from home-source food by gender from HFCS65 to NHANES07 are shown in Additional file 1: Table S1. From 1965\u20131966 to 2007\u20132008, total mean daily energy intake increased by 738 kJ/day amongst females (p \u2264 0.001), and but did not change significantly for men. Amongst males and females, the percentage of energy consumed from home-source food decreased 24.5% and 23.9% respectively between 1965\u20131966 and 2007\u20132008 (p \u2264 0.001). In absolute terms, these surveys show a fairly consistent decrease in energy consumed away-from-home until 1994\u20131996, with virtually no subsequent change in energy consumed away-from home for men or women from 1994\u20131996 to 2007\u20132008 .\nTrends in total energy intake and energy consumed from home food sources by income group are shown in Figure 1. Overall daily energy increased for all income groups, with total energy increasing by 634 kJ/day in the low income group (p= 0.019), 462 kJ/day in the middle income group (p = 0.066), and 495 kJ/day in the high income groups (p = 0.035). Across all three income groups, consumption from home food sources decreased by approximately 23% from 1965\u20131966 to 2007\u20132008 (p \u2264 0.001), with the majority of decline occurring prior to 1994\u20131996 and no significant change occurring during the 2000\u2019s. The lowest income group consumed the highest proportion of home-source food across all years, while the highest income group consumed the least amount of food from home sources across all years.\nFood preparation\nPrior to 2003, the sample of adults had a slightly higher proportion of men and lower proportion of low income Americans than the US population. The proportion of men who cooked increased from 29% in 1965\u20131966 to 42% in 2007-2008(p \u2264 0.001), and of those who cooked, time spent cooking increased from 37.4 min/day to 45.0 min/day (p \u2264 0.001) (Table 2). For women, the proportion of women cooking declined from 92% in 1965\u20131966 to 68% in 2007\u20132008 (p \u2264 0.001), and those who did cook showed a decrease in time spent from 112.8 min/day in 1965\u20131966 to 65.6 min/day in 2007\u20132008 (p \u2264 0.001) (Table 2).\nFewer people cooked in 2007\u20132008 compared to 1965\u20131966 for all income groups, although the low income groups showed the largest decline in the proportion cooking, from 67% in 1965\u20131966 to 56% in 2007\u20132008 (p \u2264 0.001) (Table 2). All income groups showed similar declines in the amount of time spent cooking by those who cooked, with low, middle and high income groups showing a decline of 35\u201336 min/day from 1965-1966 to 2007\u20132008 (p \u2264 0.001). For all groups, the largest declines in time spent cooking occurred between 1965 to 1992, with declines of 29.2, 39.2 and 41.1 min/day for high, middle, and low income groups respectively. After 1992, decline in time spent cooking leveled off, with the low income group actually increasing cooking time from 57.6 min/day in 1992 to 64.0 min/day in 2007\u20132008, and the middle and high income groups showing declines of 3.3 min and 6.9 min/day respectively. There were no significant differences in the amount of time spent cooking between low and high income groups except in 2003\u20132004 and 2007\u20132008, when those who cooked in low income groups reported 63.5 min/day and 64.0 min/day respectively, compared to 55.8 min/day and 56.5 min/day respectively in the high income group (p \u2264 0.001). Time reported in food preparation tended to be clustered around 15 minute intervals at 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min as expected due to clumped reporting.\nDiscussion\nThis study showed important shifts in home food consumption and food preparation time patterns. The frequency of eating away-from-home foods increased for all groups from 1965\u20131966 until 2007\u20132008, consistent with previous reports [4, 6], yet home food sources remain the top source of daily energy across all socio-demographic groups. The overall amount of time spent in food preparation has decreased, as fewer people cook per day and those who cook spend less time on cooking. However, the key finding of this study is that the rate of relative decline in both home food consumption and time spent in food preparation appears to have plateaued in the mid-1990s, with little additional decrease occurring in later years.\nWhen considered together, the dietary and time use data suggest several distinct trends. First, the lack of change in eating out and in cooking during the late 1990\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s suggests that US adults have achieved a stable pattern where roughly a two-thirds of daily energy are consumed from home sources, with the remaining third coming from away-from-home foods, including fast food and restaurants. Given the stability of this trend over the past 20 years, it seems unlikely that US adults will show further increases in eating out.\nSecond, although the home food supply has remained the top source of daily energy, only slightly more than half of US adults cook foods on a given day. This pattern could emerge as the result of several possibilities. First, because the time use data does not account for activities of other household members, it is possible that those who do not cook are being cooked for by other members of the household. However, given that the proportion of people who cook and the time they spend cooking has declined across all groups, cooking by other household members cannot entirely account for the difference between home food consumption and home cooking. More likely, more people are relying upon ready-to-eat foods that require no preparation. The category of foods requiring no preparation ranges from raw produce (apples, carrots) to snack foods (chips, cookies) to pre-prepared meals from the grocery store. Similarly, the decrease in time spent in food preparation suggests that when people do cook, they are relying more heavily on packaged and convenience foods (e.g., boxed flavored rice, pasta sauce jars, frozen pizzas), which are faster to prepare [14\u201317]. Future research is needed to better understand how much people cook from scratch, or if \u201chome cooking\u201d consists mostly of heating up pre-processed foods.\nThis shift from food prepared at-home to increased consumption of convenience/easy-to-prepare and away-from-home foods may have important nutritional implications. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have shown that AFH foods have been associated with increased energy intake and decreased nutritional quality [5, 7, 41\u201344], as well as increased weight gain [45, 46]. In contrast, eating foods prepared from scratch is associated with increased intakes of fruits, vegetables and whole grains [14, 47, 48]. Increased cooking has also been linked to improved overall health [49], a decrease in BMI [13, 50] and improved survival [51].\nGender differences\nWhile both men and women increased consumption of away-from-home foods from 1965\u20131966 to 2007\u20132008, men nearly doubled their overall cooking time, while women more than halved the amount of time spent in food preparation activity. This finding is supported by studies documenting shifts in gender roles, changes in household demographic composition, and the increased education, labor force experience, and occupational attainment of women [10, 11, 18] resulting in less time spent in food preparation [10\u201312]. This trend has occurred simultaneously with increases in processed prepared meals, convenience foods, and away-from-home-eating [52\u201355]. However, women continue to spend more than twice the amount of time cooking than men, suggesting that traditional attitudes towards responsibility for household food preparation persist.\nIncome differentials\nThe percent of daily energy from home food sources decreased by similar amounts across all income groups, but low income individuals consumed a higher proportion of food from home sources across all years. Time spent in food preparation decreased across all three income groups, with the distributions of time spent cooking between income groups becoming more similar to each other in 2007\u20132008 than in 1965\u20131966 as fewer people cooked and spent less time cooking. Low income participants spent the most time in food preparation in later years, but showed the greatest decline in proportion preparing food.\nDespite consuming 72% of daily energy from home food sources, lower income individuals appear to be increasingly less likely to cook, suggesting a greater reliance upon foods that requiring little preparation rather than increased eating out. A shift towards processed, packaged foods eaten at home is consistent with Drewnowski\u2019s work demonstrating that energy-dense diets comprised of refined grains, added sugars, and added fats cost less than fresh fruits and vegetables, meats, and fish [56], and this price disparity between energy-dense foods and more healthful foods has increased over time [57]. {Monsivais, 2010 #163, [58]} These results show that in addition to cost, time may represent a major barrier to the preparation of raw produce, lean proteins, and whole grains for low income groups.\nIndeed, previous studies have shown that time is a main barrier for cooking healthy foods amongst low-income individuals [59] and may prohibit beneficiaries of food assistance programs such as SNAP from meeting healthy meal targets [60\u201362]. Low-income adults may especially feel the burden of time scarcity and reduce food preparation time [63, 64]. Constraints of lower status jobs such as working multiple jobs, long hours, shift scheduling, and overtime pose barriers for low-income adults to prepare meals at home [65].\nLack of cooking knowledge, confidence, and skills can also limit at-home preparation of healthy meals [66, 67] and may explain some of the trend towards decreased cooking. Historically, education on food and cooking has been an integral part of the US public school curricula. The Smith-Hughes Act of 1917 provided funding for the training of teachers home economics [68], with widespread provision of home economics classes in middle and elementary schools for much of the 20th century. However, participation in home economics classes in most US schools has declined over recent decades [69], and although this decline occurred after the largest decrease in cooking had already taken place, this trend suggests that decreased cooking confidence and skills may have contributed to decreased cooking amongst young adults in the 1990\u2019s and 2000\u2019s. Although this decrease in formal home economics education in the 1990\u2019s occurred primarily after the largest decline in cooking had already happened, this decline likely remains an important contributor to decreased cooking amongst young adults in the 1990\u2019s and 2000\u2019s. Similarly, informal mechanisms of cooking education such as teaching at home by parents or relatives may decline as adults who cook infrequently are unlikely to teach these skills to their offspring. Unfortunately, the current lack of national data on home economics classes and cooking abilities prevents evaluation of cooking skills and knowledge in the US.\nLimitations\nWhile this study uses nationally representative diet and time use surveys, because neither set of surveys accounts for both food intake and time use, the association between food preparation and daily energy cannot be examined. In addition, the diet data do not provide detailed information on whether food from stores is precooked, semi-processed or purchased as raw ingredients. Furthermore, method differences in data collection over time may further hamper trends analysis of at-home nutrient intake [4] and time use. Because the time use surveys did not collect information on secondary activities outside of childcare, it is possible that as people have begun to multi-task more, they are less likely to report cooking as a primary activity. Such changes in reporting could result in an apparent decline in time spent cooking, even if the actual amount of time spent cooking remained the same.\nWhile this analysis did not control for shifts in the population age structure over time, restricting the analysis sample to adults age 19 to 60 helps to reduce the effect of shifts into the elderly population. Moreover, because older adults tend to cook more and eat out less than younger adults, we expect that adjusting for the aging of the population would result in an even larger decline in cooking in more recent years. Similarly, variation in how race/ethnicity was measured across time in the various surveys precluded adjustment for race/ethnicity in this analysis. Certainly, the population distribution of race/ethnicity has certainly shifted from 1965 to 2007, primarily with regards to the rapidly growing Hispanic population. However, because Hispanics tend to cook more often and for longer, we would expect that adjustment for race/ethnicity would further strengthen the observed decline in cooking. Future work should focus on examining how these key sociodemographic factors affect food preparation and consumption patterns.\nAlthough it is clear that packaged goods rather than raw produce and animal-source foods increasingly represent the bulk of store purchases [70\u201372], possibly the result of increased consumer demand for such products, the exact nature of the cooking process and skills required remains unknown. Further research is required to fully understand how the food preparation process is linked to dietary intake: is it the amount time spent cooking that matters, is it simply the use of healthier ingredients, or is there some quality about the food preparation processes that yields better food choices? Alternately, the link between cooking and health could represent a selectivity issue, with those cooking extensively having better diet quality due to consciousness about nutrition.\nThe other major limitation is our inability to examine causal effects using this data. As with many other changes in global eating patterns [73], the underlying cause of the vast shift towards decreased cooking and increased consumption of processed foods [74, 75], is partially attributable to demographic shifts including increased female labor force participation, delayed marriage, and smaller family size [10] and as well as food-related societal changes, including the diffusion of labor-saving technology [76], the declining occurrence of family meals [77] and increased snacking [20]. However, with existing data, it is not possible to determine how much these dietary changes are also linked with shifts in marketing and promotion of a lifestyle that includes fast food and processed foods as ways to reduce time spent cooking.\nConclusion\nThis study demonstrates that people are eating out more and spending less time cooking, and that these changes appear to have stabilized. These results suggest two possible ways for improving diets in the US: 1) improve the healthfulness of away-from-home foods; and 2) boost people\u2019s ability to prepare healthy foods at home within a short amount of time. In recent years, the public health community has focused on the former strategy, with initiatives ranging from menu labeling to limits on portion sizes of sugar-sweetened beverages purchased at fast food restaurants. However, the present results show that the top source of energy remains food consumed from home sources, and perhaps more importantly, that the shift towards eating out has leveled off. Given that at-home food remains the most important source of Americans\u2019 diet, a more effective approach might seek to boost the healthfulness of foods that people make and consume at home.\nOne feasible strategy for improving the quality of foods cooked and consumed at home is to promote home-cooking. Yet, these results show that Americans across social classes appear willing to spend only about an hour a day on cooking, or roughly 20 minutes per meal. Considering that this figure has remained stable since the mid-1990\u2019s it seems unlikely that time spent cooking will increase in the near future. SNAP and other programmatic efforts promoting the purchase of produce and preparation of healthy meals must consider limits on time as significant barriers to promoting healthy eating and decreasing fast food intake. This strategy is garnering increased attention by the Institute of Medicine, who recently released a report acknowledging that the nutrition allotment programs need to account the cost\u2013time tradeoff in reaching nutrition goals by applying a time adjustment multiplier to the cost of the Thrifty Food Plan or adjusting the earned income deduction to reflect time pressures [78]. How the USDA handles this adjustment could play a key role in diet quality for these participants: if financial benefits are simply increased so that participants can buy more fully prepared or processed objects, time spent cooking could decrease but so could diet quality. An effort to educate and inform recipients that increased funds can be used to purchase convenient yet healthy items is essential to ensure that increased benefits are not allocated towards increased unhealthy foods.\nOne possible solution is the return of home economics classes as part of the school curriculum, which could teach young people how to combine healthy convenience items such as canned beans or whole-wheat pasta with foods prepared from scratch [79] to minimize both time and cost. This approach, which has already been initiated in the UK [25\u201327, 80] may be a key strategy for helping Americans reduce weight gain and improve dietary intake. In the US, the Cooking Matters program has been rolled out across 40 states, employing 6-week courses to teach children, adults and families at risk of hunger how to purchase and prepare healthy food [81]. Further research is required to determine how home cooking is linked to better dietary intake, and what types of home-cooked foods can maximize both time and health.\nAvailability of supporting data\nThe dietary datasets supporting the results of this article are available in the NHANES repository at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/nhanes_questionnaires.htm.

These same programs expanded the role of government as the initiator and manager of social change. The enlargement of government functions that began in the 1960s and continues to this day, together with corporate and organizational consolidation in the private sector, changed the United States from a decentralized to a highly centralized nation. The transition has been uncomfortable, partly because centralization is not wholly compatible with other democratic values, and partly because American political institutions were originally designed to thwart centralization. This volume documents the trends involved in this transformation.Source: PublisherOther editions1991199119331933Campus VerlagBow Historical BooksVerlag nicht ermittelbarMcGraw-HillHardcoverHardcover\u2014\u2014590 pages590 pages\u2014\u2014More editionsCommon terms and phrasesactivitiesadultsageAmericanAnnualassociationsaverageBased on StatisticalbehaviorblackscapitaCaplowCensusCodebookcompact disksconfidenceconsumerconsumptioncontinuedcrimeCurrent Population SurveyDavis and SmithdecadesdeclinedollarseconomicelectionsemployeesemploymentenrollmentethnicexpendituresFederalFemaleGallup Reportgroupsgrowthhigh schoolHispanichouseholdMore terms and phrasesShow lessGet bookBorrowFind in a librarySearch in WorldCat.Search WorldCatAbout the workOriginally published: 1991Subject: Social Science / Anthropology / Cultural & Social, Social Science / Sociology / General, United States -- Social conditions -- 1960-1980 -- 1980-, United States -- Social conditions -- 1960-1980 -- 1980-2020, United States -- Social conditions -- 1980-2020 -- 1960-1990See moreAuthorTheodore Caplow is Commonwealth Professor of Sociology at the University of Virginia.

  "argos_summary": "The article reflects on nostalgic food traditions in America, highlighting practices such as handwritten recipe cards, fondue parties, and home canning that have largely faded from contemporary culture. It discusses the evolution of dining utensils, the decline of fruitcake as a holiday staple, and the rise and fall of Tupperware parties. Additionally, it examines the historical significance of supper clubs and the changing landscape of home cooking, noting a decline in cooking frequency and time spent in the kitchen, particularly among lower-income groups. The piece emphasizes the importance of these traditions in shaping social connections and culinary practices.",
