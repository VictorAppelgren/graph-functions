  "content": "GeekWire\u2019s startup coverage documents the Pacific Northwest entrepreneurial scene. Sign up for our weekly startup newsletter , and check out the GeekWire funding tracker and venture capital directory .\n\nFrom clean tech to voice tech, we\u2019re spotlighting another batch of early stage startups making moves in Seattle.\n\nA big thanks to Austin Guyette, partner at Seattle venture capital firm Voyager Capital, who provided the \u201cVC View\u201d investor perspective for each startup.\n\nRead more to learn about the companies, and check out past startup radar spotlights here. Email me at taylor@geekwire.com to flag startups to feature.\n\nThe business: AI supertool for sound. Aims to detect matches between songs, layers within songs, and different audio components \u2014 a self-described \u201csmart, semantic copyright detection\u201d tool. Audiori is preparing for a limited beta launch later this month. Aiming to partner with studios, rights organizations, and media platforms.\n\nLeadership: CEO and co-founder Remya Nair Stephen has a background in tech and creative industries, and was a VP of operations at gaming startup CropBytes. Co-founder Ian McCann has expertise in deep learning and signal processing; he was a data scientist at Conversica and CTO at Steno.ai.\n\nVC View from Austin Guyette: \u201cRights enforcement and fraud detection is a hot topic given the rise of GenAI (Seattle-based Loti is also in this category). For high-profile artists, there is a world where this is a no-brainer! However, it\u2019s an open question if most of the value in this market accrues to law firms or to products like Audiori.\u201d\n\nThe business: Motorized electric trailers that help EV drivers reduce range loss. Also aims to provide fuel savings for internal combustion engine fleets during towing. Targeting commercial trailer fleets, municipal utilities, last-mile delivery services, and others. The company won a prize at the UW\u2019s recent Environmental Innovation Challenge.\n\nLeadership: Founder and CEO Frank Lin is a former realtor and restaurant owner, and earned a masters degree in entrepreneurship this summer from the UW. Co-founders Julisa Cruz and Lillian Mitchell also graduated from the UW this year.\n\nVC View: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a push to electrify commercial transport but this market is hotly contested. The value here seems to be in hardware patents and an exit to an incumbent who wants to acquire the technology is certainly possible.\u201d\n\nThe business: Voice-powered onboarding agent that integrates into existing software products and interacts through natural conversation. The idea is to replace static tooltips or lengthy product tours. The startup has a few customers and recently added nearly 90 companies to test its latest release.\n\nLeadership: CEO and co-founder Jose Kuttan previously started and sold retail tech company WeavedIn to Paytm. His co-founders \u2014 Dilip Prasad, Jeph Alapat, and Jibin Scaria \u2014 also worked at WeavedIn.\n\nVC View: \u201cMartech and CX are being re-imagined with GenAI and this is a good example of those trends. I\u2019d encourage folks to chat with the agent on their website \u2014 if you extrapolate a bit this could be a really cool product! The signals coming of interactions with agents like this could be gold for companies \u2014 the billion-dollar question is how products like Fluidworks evolve from point solutions into broader platforms with incumbents and competitors already playing in adjacent areas.\u201d\n\nThe business: Construction tech startup that wants to help improve communication for small and mid-sized teams. Aims to streamline updates, reduce rework errors and stay aligned across stakeholders \u2014 without needing to adopt project management software. The company is working with multiple design clients.\n\nLeadership: CEO Jonathan Madamba has nearly three decades of experience in tech, including leadership stints at Software AG and T-Mobile, and has industry expertise in construction. Co-founder Jez Zapata specializes in sales and also worked at SADA, a cloud consultancy.\n\nVC View: \u201cConstruction is under-penetrated from a technology standpoint so there may be an opportunity here. That said, I signed up for this alpha product, played around with it, and still don\u2019t know what it does or what value it provides. A great first-mile product experience is key for SMB go-to-market so my hope is that their beta product improves on the current version.\u201d",

In each technique, optical pyrometry is employed; however, the shock temperature measurements of the several groups usually use from four to twelve wavelengths between 400 and 1050 nm, while the diamond cell experiments involve optical multichannel analyzer data over a smaller spectral range. Additionally, the shock data are of spectral radiance, versus, typically, spectral irradiance for the static measurements. We propose that the argon pressure medium often used in laser-heated diamond anvil cell temperature measurements exhibits a spectral transmittance filtering effect that affects the apparent temperature measured. This is due to the large thermal gradients and the concomitant refractive index variations. We use an optical transfer matrix approach to calculate the effect on the measured spectral radiance and temperature, and find that some published diamond cell data should be modified.\nProjects\n-\nwebMethodsCloud.com\n-\nSee projectHead of global deployment for SAG first Platform as a Service (PaaS) for webMethods Integration solutions.\nHonors & Awards\n-\nAT&T Mobile Hackathon Winner (3 Top Categories)\nAT&T Mobile Hackathon Judging Panel\nCreated solution and startup model for integrated cloud, mobile, and robotics solution in 24hr sprint.\n-\nChairman's Award for System Engineer of the Year\nSoftware AG\n-\nPresident's Club Award\nSoftware AG\nMore activity by Jon\n-\nAnother huge week in AI Agents \ud83e\uddf5 I summarized everything announced by Google, Microsoft, Auth0, VS Code, Firebase, Julius, CrewAI, Camel AI\u2026\nAnother huge week in AI Agents \ud83e\uddf5 I summarized everything announced by Google, Microsoft, Auth0, VS Code, Firebase, Julius, CrewAI, Camel AI\u2026\nLiked by Jon Madamba\n-\nI am glad I returned to India after my Machine Learning PhD at MIT.
