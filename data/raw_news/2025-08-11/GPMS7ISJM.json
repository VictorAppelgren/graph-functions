  "description": "WHEAT RIDGE, CO / ACCESS Newswire / August 11, 2025 / Lifeloc Technologies, Inc. (OTCID:LCTC), a global leader in the development and manufacturing of breath alcohol and drug testing devices, has announced financial results for the quarter ended June ...",
  "content": "We believe our core alcohol detection product line-up is strong. The L-series LX9 and LT7 units have features and performance that are driving market penetration by meeting previously unaddressable market needs, such as smart phone pairing, wider temperature use ranges and fast customization that incorporates local languages. We expect that sales of our newer L-series devices will be incremental to FC-series devices rather than displacing FC sales. The L-series devices have been certified to meet the requirements of most modern registration standards, such as SAI's (Standards Australia International) latest AS 3547:2019 standards for Breath Alcohol Detectors. We continue to evolve the capability and add certifications of these units to create more value and gain market share. Our FC-series devices remain popular with many law enforcement and international organizations. Our Easycal\u00ae automated calibration station, the only automated calibration available for portable breath alcohol testers, builds valuable protection around our brand and contributes to market share gains across the board, especially for our workplace Phoenix\u00ae 6.0 BT and EV 30 devices.\n\nLifeloc posted quarterly net revenue of $2.219 million in the second quarter of 2025, resulting in a quarterly net loss of $(394) thousand, or $(0.14) per diluted share. These results compare to net revenue of $2.387 million and quarterly net loss of $(298) thousand, or $(0.12) per diluted share in the second quarter of 2024. Revenue for the quarter declined 7% versus the second quarter last year. Six-month net revenues of $4.496 million and a net loss of $(686) thousand, or $(0.25) per diluted share, compared to net revenue of $4.541 million and a net loss of $(582) thousand, or $(0.24) per diluted share, for the same six months of 2024. Total gross margin in the second quarter remained about the same, 41.7% versus 41.6% for the same quarter last year. For the first six months of 2025 gross margin was 40.8% versus 40.3% for the same period last year, with price increases largely offsetting inflation and tariff costs. The research and development investment for the quarter remained high at $623 thousand, primarily for SpinDx development, resulting in the current period loss.\n\nWHEAT RIDGE, CO / ACCESS Newswire / August 11, 2025 / Lifeloc Technologies, Inc. (OTCID:LCTC), a global leader in the development and manufacturing of breath alcohol and drug testing devices, has announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2025.\n\nWe believe our most important goal and best opportunity remains the convergence of the global need for rapid detection of drugs of abuse with Lifeloc's proven capability to build easy-to-use portable testing equipment. We are therefore focusing our research and development efforts on leveraging the SpinDx\u2122 technology platform, sometimes referred to as \"Lab on a Disk,\" to develop a series of devices and tests that can be used at roadside and in emergency rooms, forensic labs and workplace test sites to achieve a rapid and quantitative measure for a panel of drugs of abuse. SpinDx has been demonstrated in our laboratory to effectively detect for delta-9-THC, cocaine, fentanyl, amphetamine, methamphetamine, morphine, MDMA, and benzodiazepines. Testing has validated the SpinDx measurement technology against the definitive standard liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LCMS) measurement utilizing human samples. The LCMS data have validated the SpinDx test results on real-world human saliva tests at a limit of detection of approximately 10 ng/ml. With our research and development work, we continue to improve our technology's robustness, speed, and convenience of operation. We are currently updating disk design to accomplish the entire analysis on the disk as well as optimizing drug assays.\n\nWe are beginning beta testing of our SpinDx oral fluid testing system utilizing the delta-9-THC only tests using a prototype reader as shown in the photograph below. An agreement for beta testing is in place, and the test logistics are being finalized. The initial product release is projected to be a device with a disk that allows for detection of delta-9-THC (the major intoxicating component of the cannabis plant) from a test subject's oral fluid, followed by a disk for a panel of other drugs. Commercial launch of our first SpinDx application is projected to occur in early 2026. Following initial commercialization, we expect more offerings from this technology platform to include expanded drug panels and samples collected from blood and breath. Following the release of our SpinDx oral fluid testing system, we expect to accelerate development of combining our LX9 breathalyzer with the THC SpinDx detection unit, to produce our roadside marijuana breathalyzer system. The current pace of development may require additional financing to complete.\n\n\"SpinDx prototypes are starting to travel to trade shows for key customer demonstrations. We are pleased to build customer engagement as the product gets closer to launch. We have identified rapid drug testing as our biggest growth opportunity, and we believe that SpinDx will play an important role in addressing this unmet market need,\" commented Dr. Wayne Willkomm, President and CEO.\n\nAdditionally, in alignment with the evolving structure of the OTC Markets, Lifeloc has been approved for trading on the OTCID, which is the new market tier of the OTC Markets, and trading commenced July 1, 2025. OTCID is the replacement for fully reporting companies from the OTC Pink Current Market, which ceased on the same date. The new OTCID standards may create greater market confidence than the OTC Pink and allow a more liquid marketplace for our shareholders.\n\nLifeloc Technologies, Inc.

Purpose\nThe purpose of the Audit Committee (the \u201cCommittee\u201d) is to oversee Lifeloc Technologies, Inc.\u2019s (the \u201cCompany\u201d) accounting and financial reporting processes, the audits of the Company\u2019s financial statements, and the Company\u2019s internal controls. In so doing, the Committee should endeavor to maintain free and open means of communication between the members of the Committee, the other members of the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), the independent auditors and the management of the Company.\nIn the exercise of its oversight, it is not the duty of the Committee to plan or conduct audits or to determine that the Company\u2019s financial statements fairly present the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Instead, such duties remain under the oversight of management and the independent auditors.\nII. Membership\nThe Committee shall be composed of one or more members of the Board. The members shall be appointed by action of the Board and shall serve at the discretion of the Board. Each Committee member shall be \u201cfinancially literate\u201d as determined by the Board in its business judgment and shall satisfy the \u201cindependence\u201d requirements of the NASDAQ National Market. At least one member of the Committee shall have Accounting or related financial management expertise, as determined by the Board in its business judgment.\nIII. Committee Organization and Procedures\nA. The members of the Committee shall appoint a Chair of the Committee by majority vote. The Chair (or in his or her absence, a member designated by the Chair) shall preside at all meetings of the Committee.\nB. The Committee shall have the authority to establish its own rules and procedures consistent with the bylaws of the Company for notice and conduct of its meetings, should the Committee, in its discretion, deem it desirable to do so.\nC. The Committee may, in its discretion, include in its meetings members of the Company\u2019s financial management, representatives of the independent auditors, and other financial personnel employed or retained by the Company. The Committee may meet with the independent auditors in separate executive sessions to discuss any matters that the Committee believes should be addressed privately, without management\u2019s presence. The Committee may likewise meet privately with management, as it deems appropriate.\nD. The Committee may, at its discretion, utilize the services of the Company\u2019s regular corporate legal counsel with respect to legal matters or, at its discretion, retain outside legal counsel or other advisors if it determines that such counsel or advisors are necessary or appropriate under the circumstances.\nIV. Key Functions\nThe Committee and the Board recognize that the Company\u2019s management is responsible for preparing the Company\u2019s financial statements and that the independent auditors are responsible for auditing those financial statements. Additionally, the Committee and the Board recognize that financial management, including the internal accounting staff, as well as the independent auditors, has more time and knowledge and more detailed information concerning the Company than do Committee members; consequently, in carrying out its responsibilities, the Committee is not providing any expert or special assurance as to the Company\u2019s financial statements or any professional certificate as to the independent auditors\u2019 work. It is not the duty of the Committee to plan or conduct audits or to determine whether the Company\u2019s financial statements are complete and accurate and are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nA. Oversight Responsibilities\n(I) The independent auditors shall be ultimately accountable to the Committee and the Board in connection with the audit of the Company\u2019s annual financial statements and related services. In this regard, the Committee shall be responsible for appointing, overseeing and periodically evaluating the performance of the auditors and, if necessary, terminating the independent auditors. As appropriate, the Committee shall recommend to the Board the submission of its selection of the independent auditors for stockholder ratification at any meeting of stockholders.\n(ii) The Committee shall approve the fees to be paid to the independent auditors and any other terms of the engagement of the independent auditors. The Chair (or in his or her absence, a member designated by the Chair) may represent the entire Committee for purposes of this discussion.\n(iii) The Committee shall receive from the independent auditors, at least annually, a written statement delineating all relationships between the independent auditors and the Company, consistent with Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1. The Committee shall actively engage in a dialogue with the independent auditors with respect to any disclosed relationships or services that, in the view of the Committee, may affect the objectivity and independence of the independent auditors. If the Committee determines that further inquiry is advisable, the Committee shall recommend that the Board take any appropriate action in response to the independent auditors\u2019 independence.\nB. Annual Audit\n(I) The Committee shall meet with the independent auditors, chief financial officer and other management personnel in connection with each annual audit to discuss the scope of the audit and the procedures to be followed. The Chair (or in his or her absence, a member designated by the Chair) may represent the entire Committee for purposes of this discussion.\n(ii) The Committee shall review\u00b9 and discuss the audited financial statements with the management of the Company.\n(iii) The Committee shall discuss with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61 as then in effect including, among others: (1) the methods used to account for any significant unusual transaction reflected in the audited financial statements; (2) the effect of significant accounting policies in any controversial or emergent areas for which there is a lack of authoritative guidance or a consensus to be followed by the independent auditors; (3) the process used by management in formulating particularly sensitive accounting estimates and the basis for the auditors\u2019 conclusions regarding the reasonableness of those estimates; and (4) any disagreements with management over the application of accounting principles, the basis for management\u2019s accounting estimates, or the disclosures in the financial statements.\n(iv) The Committee shall, based on the review and discussion in paragraph B(iii) above, and based on the disclosures received from the independent auditors regarding their independence and discussions with the auditors regarding such independence, conclude whether the audited financial statements should be included in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year subject to the audit.\n\u00b9 Auditing Literature, particularly, Statement on Auditing Standards No. 100, defines the term \u201creview\u201d to include a particular set of required procedures to be undertaken by independent accountants. The members of the Audit Committee are not independent accountants, and the term \u201creview\u201d as used in this Amended Audit Committee Charter is not intended to have this meaning. Consistent with footnote 47 of the SEC Release No. 34-42266, any use in this Audit Committee Charter of the term \u201creview\u201d should not be interpreted to suggest that the Committee members can or should follow the procedures required of auditors performing review of interim financial statements.\nC. Quarterly Review\n(i) The independent auditors are required to review the interim financial statements to be included in Form 10-Q of the Company using professional standards and procedures for conducting such reviews, as established by generally accepted auditing standards as modified or supplemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, prior to the filing of the Form 10-Q. The Committee, in its discretion, may discuss with management and the independent auditors in person, at a meeting, or by conference telephone call, the results of the quarterly review including such matters as significant adjustments, management judgments, accounting estimates, significant new accounting policies and disagreements with management. The Chair (or in his or her absence, a member designated by the Chair) may represent the entire Committee for purposes of this discussion.\n(ii) The Committee shall review the Company\u2019s quarterly and annual financial statements with the Company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer before they are released publicly. The review of annual financial statements shall be conducted prior to publication.\nD. Internal Controls\n(i) The Committee shall discuss with the independent auditors, at least annually, the adequacy and effectiveness of the accounting and financial controls of the Company, and consider any recommendations for improvement of such internal control procedures.\n(ii) The Committee shall discuss with the independent auditors and with management any letter of recommendation provided by the independent auditors and any other significant matters brought to the attention of the Committee by the independent auditors as a result of its annual audit. The Committee should allow management adequate time to consider any such matters raised by the independent auditors.\nE. Other Responsibilities\n(i) The Committee shall review and reassess the Committee\u2019s Charter at least annually and submit any recommended changes to the Board for its consideration.\n(ii) The Committee shall provide the report for inclusion in the Company\u2019s Annual Proxy Statement required by Item 306 of Regulation S-K of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n(iii) The Committee, through its Chair, shall report periodically, as deemed necessary or desirable by the Committee, but at least annually, to the full Board regarding the Committee\u2019s actions and recommendations, if any.\n(iv) The Committee may institute investigations of suspected improprieties on any material matter selected by the Committee and is authorized to engage on behalf of the Company special counsel, independent auditors or outside experts when necessary.\n(v) The Committee shall annually disclose amounts received by Audit Committee members from the Company and its affiliates and any other transactions with the Company or its affiliates to which they are a party, other than amounts received for service as a Director or Board Committee member. Such disclosure shall be noted in the minutes of the appropriate Committee meeting.\n(vi) The Committee shall annually review all existing related party transactions or other conflicts of interest that exist between employees/directors and the Company. The Committee shall review all proposed related party transactions. The Company shall not enter into any related party transactions unless first approved of by the Committee. The Committee may also make recommendations to the full Board of Directors on actions to be taken that relate to any proposed or existing related party transactions.\n(viii) The Committee shall determine the appropriate level of funding to be provided by the Company for payment of the independent auditor and outside advisors and any administrative expenses incurred by the Committee in carrying out its duties.\n(ix) The Committee shall establish, implement and oversee procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters and procedures for confidential, anonymous submissions by Company employees regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters.\nF. Minutes\nMinutes of each meeting will be compiled by the Company\u2019s Corporate Secretary who shall act as Secretary to the Committee, who is also a member of the Company\u2019s internal legal staff, or in the absence of the Corporate Secretary, by an Assistant Corporate Secretary of the Company, or any other person designated by the Committee.\nInsider Trading Policy\nLIFELOC TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nINSIDER TRADING POLICY\nI.

Because the Company cannot know what every employee or consultant knows at any specific time, any individual possessing what could be construed to be Material Nonpublic Information should consult the Chief Financial Officer before engaging in any securities transactions, or in any way discussing the information with non-Lifeloc Technologies, Inc. personnel.\n- Trading on Material Nonpublic Information: No director, officer or employee of, or consultant to, the Company, and no member of the immediate family or household of any such person, shall engage in any transaction involving a purchase or sale of the Company\u2019s securities, including any offer to purchase or offer to sell, during any period commencing with the date that he or she possesses Material Nonpublic Information concerning the Company, and ending at the close of business on the second Trading Day following the date of public disclosure of that information, or at such time as such nonpublic information is no longer material.\n- Tipping: No Insider shall disclose (\u201ctip\u201d) Material Nonpublic Information to any other person (including family members) where such information may be used by such person to his or her profit by trading in the securities of companies to which such information relates, nor shall such Insider or related person make recommendations or express opinions on the basis of Material Nonpublic Information as to trading in the Company\u2019s securities.\n- Confidentiality of Nonpublic Information: Nonpublic information relating to the Company is the property of the Company and the unauthorized disclosure of such information is forbidden.\n- Directors and officers of the Company must also comply with the reporting obligations and limitations on short-swing transactions set forth in Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The practical effect of these provisions is that officers and directors who purchase and sell the Company\u2019s securities within a six-month period must disgorge all profits to the Company whether or not they had knowledge of any Material Nonpublic Information. Under these provisions, and so long as certain other criteria are met, neither the receipt of an option under the Company\u2019s option plans, nor the exercise of that option, is deemed a purchase under Section 16; however, the sale of any such shares is a sale under Section 16.\n- No officer or director may ever make a short sale of the Company\u2019s stock.\nV. POTENTIAL CRIMINAL AND CIVIL LIABILITY AND/OR DISCIPLINARY ACTION:\n- Liability for Insider Trading. Insiders may be subject to penalties of up to $1,000,000 and up to ten years in jail for engaging in transactions in the Company\u2019s securities at a time when they have knowledge of Material Nonpublic Information regarding the Company.\n- Liability for Tipping. Insiders may also be liable for improper transactions by any person (commonly referred to as a \u201ctippee\u201d) to whom they have disclosed Material Nonpublic Information regarding the Company or to whom they have made recommendations or expressed opinions on the basis of such information as to trading in the Company\u2019s securities. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) has imposed large penalties even when the disclosing person did not profit from the trading. The SEC, the stock exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. use sophisticated electronic surveillance techniques to uncover insider trading.\n- Possible Disciplinary Action. Employees of the Company who violate this Policy shall also be subject to disciplinary action by the Company, which may include ineligibility for future participation in the Company\u2019s equity incentive plans or termination of employment.\nVI. GUIDELINES:\n- Suggested Closure of Trading Window For Officers, Directors and All Employees. The period beginning five trading days before the end of each quarter and ending one Trading Day following the date of public disclosure of the financial results for that quarter, is a particularly sensitive period of time for transactions in the Company\u2019s stock from the perspective of compliance with applicable securities laws. This sensitivity is due to the fact that officers, directors and certain other employees and consultants will, during that period, often possess Material Nonpublic Information about the expected financial results for the quarter.\nAccordingly, to ensure compliance with this Policy and applicable federal and state securities laws, it is suggested that all directors, officers, employees and consultants having access to the Company\u2019s internal financial statements or other Material Nonpublic Information not conduct transactions involving the purchase or sale of the Company\u2019s securities during this period.\nFrom time to time, the Company may also recommend that directors, officers, selected employees and others suspend trading because of developments known to the Company and not yet disclosed to the public. In such event, such persons are advised not to engage in any transaction involving the purchase or sale of the company\u2019s securities during such period and should not disclose to others the fact of such suspension of trading.\nThe purpose behind the suggested self-imposed non-Trading Window period is to help establish a diligent effort to avoid any improper transaction.\nIt should be noted, however, that even during the Trading Window, any person possessing Material Nonpublic Information concerning the Company should not engage in any transaction in the Company\u2019s securities until such information has been known publicly for at least one Trading Day, whether or not the Company has recommended a suspension of trading to that person. Trading in the Company\u2019s securities during the Trading Window should not be considered a \u201csafe harbor,\u201d and all directors, officers and other persons should use good judgment at all times. - Preclearance of Trades. The Company has determined that all officers and directors of the Company must refrain from trading in the Company\u2019s securities, even during the Trading Window, without first complying with the Company\u2019s preclearance process. Each officer and director should contact the Company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer prior to commencing any trade in the Company\u2019s securities. The Company may find it necessary, from time to time, to require compliance with the preclearance process from certain employees and consultants other than and in addition to officers and directors.\n- Individual Responsibility. Every officer, director, employee and consultant has the individual responsibility to comply with this Policy regarding insider trading, regardless of whether the Company has a suggested Trading Window for that Insider or any other Insiders of the Company. The guidelines set forth in this Policy are guidelines only, and appropriate judgment should be exercised in connection with any trade in the Company\u2019s securities.\n- An Insider may, from time to time, have to forego a proposed transaction in the Company\u2019s securities even if he or she planned to make the transaction before learning of the Material Nonpublic Information and even though the Insider believes he or she may suffer an economic loss or forego anticipated profit by waiting.\n- For purposes of this Policy, the Company considers that the exercise of stock options under the Company\u2019s stock option plans (but not the sale of any such shares) is exempt from this Policy, since the other party to the transaction is the Company itself and the price does not vary with the market but is fixed by the terms of the option agreement or the stock option plan.\nVII. INSIDE INFORMATION REGARDING OTHER PUBLIC COMPANIES:\nThis Policy and the guidelines described herein also apply to Material Nonpublic Information relating to other companies, including the Company\u2019s customers, vendors or suppliers (\u201cbusiness partners\u201d), when that information is obtained in the course of employment with or other services performed on behalf of, the Company. Civil and criminal penalties, and termination of employment may result from trading on inside information regarding the Company\u2019s business partners. All employees should treat Material Nonpublic Information about the Company\u2019s business partners with the same care required with respect to information related directly to the Company.\nCode of Ethics\nCODE OF ETHICS\nOF\nLIFELOC TECHNOLOGIES, INC\n(as adopted April 19, 2010)\nI. Introduction\nThe board of directors (the \"Board\") of Lifeloc Technologies, Inc., a Colorado corporation, (the \"Company\"), has adopted this Lifeloc Technologies, Inc. Code of Ethics (this \"Code\"), which is applicable to all directors, officers and employees of the Company, to:\n- promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships\n- promote the full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with, or submits to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), as well as in other public communications made by or on behalf of the Company;\n- promote compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;\n- deter wrongdoing; and\n- require prompt internal reporting of breaches of, and accountability for adherence to, this Code.\nNo code or policy can anticipate every situation that may arise. Accordingly, this Code is intended to serve as a source of guiding principles. Directors, officers and employees are encouraged to bring questions about particular circumstances that may involve one or more of the provisions of this Code to the attention of the Company's Chief Executive Officer or Chairman of the Board, who may consult with the Company's outside legal counsel as appropriate.\nThis Code may be amended only by unanimous resolution of the Board of Directors.\nII. Honest, Ethical and Fair Conduct\nEach director, officer and employee of the Company owes a duty to the Company to act with integrity. Integrity requires, among other things, being honest, fair and candid. Deceit, dishonesty and subordination of principle are inconsistent with integrity.

Anything that would be a conflict for a person subject to this Code also will be a conflict if it is related to a member of his or her family or a close relative.\nExamples of conflict of interest situations include, but are not limited to, the following:- any significant ownership interest in any supplier or customer;\n- any consulting or employment relationship with any customer, supplier or competitor;\n- any outside business activity that detracts from an individual's ability to devote appropriate time and attention to his or her responsibilities with the Company;\n- conducting business with, or competing with, an entity in which a director, officer or employee has an ownership interest or in which a close relative has an ownership or employment interest, unless such business relationship has been disclosed and authorized by a majority of the independent members of the Board;\n- the receipt of any money, non-nominal gifts or excessive entertainment from any company with which the Company has current or prospective business dealings or from any entity if the money, gift or entertainment is for the purposes of influencing the director, officer or employee in his or her capacity as such;\n- being in the position of supervising, reviewing or having any influence on the job evaluation, pay or benefit of any close relative;\n- selling anything to the Company or buying anything from the Company, except on the same terms and conditions as comparable officers or directors are permitted to so purchase or sell; and\n- any other circumstance, event, relationship or situation in which the personal interest of a person subject to this Code interferes\u2013or even appears to interfere\u2013with the interests of the Company as a whole.\nIII. Disclosure\nThe Company strives to ensure that the contents of and the disclosures in the reports and documents that the Company files with the SEC and other public communications shall be full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable in accordance with applicable disclosure standards, including standards of materiality, where appropriate.

Compliance\nIt is the Company's obligation and policy to comply with all applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. It is the personal responsibility of each person to, and each person must, adhere to the standards and restrictions imposed by those laws, rules and regulations, including those relating to accounting and auditing matters.\nV.

Any director, officer or employee who becomes aware of any existing or potential breach of this Code is required to notify the Chairman of the Board or the Chairman of the Audit Committee promptly. Failure to do so is itself a breach of this Code.\n- Each director, officer and employee must:\n- notify the Chairman of the Board or the Chairman of the Audit Committee promptly of any existing or potential violation of this Code; and\n- not retaliate against any other person for reports of potential violations that are made in good faith.\n- The Company will follow the following procedures in investigating and enforcing this Code and in reporting on the Code:\n- The Board or Audit Committee will take all appropriate action to investigate any breaches reported to it.\n- If the Board or Audit Committee determines (by majority decision) that a breach has occurred, it will inform the entire Board.\n- Upon being notified that a breach has occurred, the Board (by majority decision) will take or authorize such disciplinary or preventive action as it deems appropriate, after consultation with the Audit Committee and/or the Company's counsel, up to and including dismissal or, in the event of criminal or other serious violations of law, notification of the SEC or other appropriate law enforcement authorities.\nNo person who reports an incident in accordance with the above procedure shall, as a result of following such procedure, be subject by the Company or any officer or employee thereof to discharge, demotion suspension, threat, harassment, or, in any manner, discrimination against such person in terms and conditions of employment.\nVI.

In line with this commitment, and Lifeloc\u2019s commitment to open communication, this policy aims to provide an avenue for employees to raise concerns and reassurance that they will be protected from reprisals or victimization for whistleblowing. This whistleblowing policy is intended to protect you if you raise concerns regarding Lifeloc.\n- Such concerns may include:\n- incorrect financial reporting;\n- unlawful activity;\n- activities that are not in line with Lifeloc policy, including our Code of Business Conduct; or activities which otherwise amount to serious improper conduct.\nSafeguards\nHarassment or victimization for reporting concerns under this policy will not be tolerated.\nConfidentiality\nEvery effort will be made to treat the complainant\u2019s identity with appropriate regard for confidentiality. You may choose to remain anonymous.\nAnonymous Allegations\nThis policy encourages employees to put their names to allegations because appropriate follow-up questions and investigation may not be possible unless the source of the information is identified. Concerns expressed anonymously will be explored appropriately, but consideration will be given to:\n- The seriousness of the issue raised;\n- The credibility of the concern; and\n- The likelihood of confirming the allegation from attributable sources\nBad Faith Allegations\nAllegations in bad faith may result in disciplinary action.\nReporting A Concern\nThe whistleblowing procedure is intended to be used for serious and sensitive issues.

These internal procedures should be read in conjunction with the Whistleblower Policy.\n- All communications received will be directed to all Audit Committee Members who may then designate Investigating Members to follow up on the reported complaint or concern.\n- The Investigating Members will determine whether the report falls within the scope of responsibility of the Audit Committee relating to financial and accounting matters. If the report is not within the scope of these procedures, the Investigating Members will inform any employee making the report (if known) to use other procedures of the Company to address the complaint or concern. The Investigating Members should also forward any report it determines is not covered by these procedures to the Company\u2019s legal counsel.\n- The Investigating Members may consult with the Company\u2019s legal counsel or independent legal counsel in their discretion to obtain advice regarding follow up on any complaint or concern.\n- The Investigating Members may request information from any source in connection with the investigation of a report.

The Investigating Members shall report to the Audit Committee at each regularly scheduled meeting regarding the reports received since the last meeting and the current status of any open reports. A special meeting of the Audit Committee may be called to discuss any report or to determine appropriate follow up action with respect to any report.\n- When feasible, the Investigating Members shall report back to any employee who has raised a complaint or concern (if known) regarding the results of the investigation and any corrective action taken, if providing such information will not interfere with the rights of other employees or with any ongoing criminal or civil investigation.\n- A confidential log shall be maintained by the Audit Committee of all complaints and concerns received under the Company\u2019s Complaint Procedures for Financial, Accounting and Audit Matters.
