  "title": "Here\u2019s How to Watch the Original Naked Gun Movies in Order in One Convenient Place",
  "description": "The Naked Gun 2025 reboot is out, so now's a great time to revisit the original trilogy, or even experience it for the first time -- and you can stream the entire series on one streaming service.",
  "content": "The Naked Gun series was a staple in my household when I was growing up. I rented the movies so regularly that my parents gave me the trilogy on DVD for Christmas one year. So when a reboot, or legacy sequel, titled The Naked Gun was announced, I was excited. And apparently, I wasn't the only one -- according to Box Office Mojo, the film generated nearly $17 million at the box office domestically in its opening weekend. Plus, The Naked Gun 2025 has a whopping 90% critic rating and 76% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, so it's garnering solid praise.\n\nWhether you're revisiting the trilogy or experiencing it for the first time, here's how to watch all of the original The Naked Gun movies in order.\n\nHow many movies are in The Naked Gun series?\n\nThe Naked Gun series is comprised of three films, with the fourth -- the reboot -- that came out in August:\n\u2022 The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad (1988)\n\u2022 The Naked Gun 2 \u00bd: The Smell of Fear (1991)\n\nThe movies are based on the character of Lt. Frank Drebin from the TV series Police Squad, which is disappointingly unavailable for streaming anywhere. So if you want to explore the roots of the franchise, you'll need to find the show on DVD or Blu-ray.\n\nDo you need to watch all The Naked Gun trilogy before the 2025 film?\n\nI would recommend watching The Naked Gun trilogy before the 2025 reboot. The new flick is a legacy sequel, or a continuation of the series, coming out many years after its predecessor. It features Liam Neeson as the son of Lt. Frank Drebin, so there's continuity with the previous film. Likewise, Paul Walter Hauser portrays Capt. Ed Hocken Jr., son of Capt. Ed Hocken (played by Alan North in Police Squad and George Kennedy in The Naked Gun film series). Plus, there may be some throughlines with the first three movies.\n\nYou can stream all of The Naked Gun movies in one convenient place\n\nAll three The Naked Gun movies -- the 1988 original, The Smell of Fear and The Final Insult -- are streaming on Paramount Plus, making it easy to binge watch the series.\n\nWhen can you stream The Naked Gun 2025 at home?\n\nThe Naked Gun 2025 hit the box office in August 2025, so chances are you won't be able to stream it at home any time soon. The first three The Naked Gun movies are all on Paramount Plus. Looking at other films on the streaming service, Smile 2 came out in October 2024, then came to premium video on-demand -- PVOD -- for paid rentals and purchases in November 2024, before making its way to Paramount Plus in December 2024. Similarly, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 had its theatrical release in December 2024, then was released on PVOD in January 2025, then hit Paramount Plus in February 2025.\n\nWe could see The Naked Gun 2025 streaming on Paramount Plus as early as October 2025 -- but it could be earlier or later, depending on several factors.\n\nHow to watch The Naked Gun movies with a VPN\n\nIf you're traveling abroad and want to keep up with your favorite shows or movies while away from home, a VPN can help enhance your privacy when streaming. It encrypts your web traffic and prevents your internet service provider from throttling your speeds, and can also be helpful when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks while traveling, adding an extra layer of privacy protection for your devices and logins.\n\nVPNs are legal in many countries, including the US and Canada, and can be used for legitimate purposes such as improving online privacy. However, some streaming services may have policies restricting VPN usage to access region-specific content. If you're considering a VPN for streaming, check the platform's terms of service to ensure compliance.\n\nIf you choose to use a VPN, follow the provider's installation instructions, ensuring you're connected securely and in compliance with applicable laws and service agreements. Some streaming platforms may block access when a VPN is detected, so verifying if your streaming subscription allows VPN usage is crucial.",

      "text": "Streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu and Disney Plus are convenient. I don\u2019t have to trek down to my local video store -- which is nearly an hour away -- to enjoy a movie or TV show at home. But with shows and movies split across so many different streaming services, you don\u2019t necessarily save money compared to cable. You\u2019ll need Netflix to watch Bridgerton, Hulu for The Bear, Max to binge-watch Sopranos reruns, Paramount Plus to enjoy Evil\u2026 you get the picture. And with streaming services like Netflix continuing to jack up their prices, a VPN can save you money by helping you maximize your money and get more value from your subscriptions.\nA virtual private network makes it look like you\u2019re in a different area -- even another country -- which unlocks videos otherwise unavailable on streaming platforms in your region. The library you see in your home country on Netflix or Disney Plus is just the tip of the iceberg, but you'll need a VPN to view what's available to stream in other regions. Whether you want to get more value out of your existing streaming service subscriptions or ditch a few platforms entirely, a VPN could be the answer. I\u2019ve been using a VPN for streaming for over a decade, initially relying on a virtual private network to watch BBC\u2019s Sherlock, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, from the UK before it hit the US. Here\u2019s how I use a VPN to keep my streaming service subscriptions under control and save money.\nHere\u2019s how I save money on streaming services by using a VPN\nAlthough I apparently watched 109 films in 2024, according to my Letterboxd, I somehow missed Longlegs, directed by Osgood Perkins. While I've been itching to watch it, the film isn't available on any of the streaming services I pay for. (And I'm subscribed to a lot of services: Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus, Max, Peacock, Paramount Plus, Amazon Prime Video and Crunchyroll, to name a few.) I couldn\u2019t even watch it on one of the several free ad-supported streaming platforms I regularly use, which include Tubi and Kanopy.\nJust as I was about to shell out the $6 to rent it from Amazon Prime Video, I decided to see if it was streaming in a country outside of the US -- luckily, it was on Amazon Prime Video in the UK. I fired up NordVPN, selected a UK server, loaded Amazon Prime Video UK and streamed the film from the comfort of my couch in the US. Because a VPN reroutes your internet traffic through servers elsewhere, it makes websites and apps -- like streaming services -- think you\u2019re based in another geographic location.\nWhile I saved around $6 in this case, unblocking region-restricted content can keep your streaming bills lower when it comes to TV shows because there are more episodes to watch, meaning months or even a year of a streaming service subscription. Law & Order Special Victims Unit is a Peacock exclusive in the US, but you can access SVU on Netflix using a UK server. With a VPN, you can pay for one service -- Netflix -- and avoid having to plonk down the cash for yet another streaming subscription.\nA VPN unlocks region-restricted content on streaming services\nUsually, when you connect to an app or website, like a streaming service, that platform can tell which geographic area you\u2019re connecting from. When you fire up Netflix from the US, it typically loads a US library. But a VPN encrypts your internet traffic by rerouting it through servers elsewhere. While connected to a VPN, streaming services like Netflix, Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video will view your traffic as coming from the server you\u2019re on. So if you\u2019re on a Canadian VPN server but sitting at home in the UK, apps and websites will think you\u2019re in Canada.\nBecause streaming rights vary by region, you\u2019ll notice different titles from the UK and US Netflix libraries. For instance, Star Trek The Next Generation is available on Paramount Plus but not Netflix in the States. However, since it\u2019s on Netflix in the UK, you can access it from the US using a VPN set to a UK server without signing up for another subscription service.\nCheck the terms of service to make sure your streaming services allow VPNs\nNote that not all streaming services allow you to use a VPN, so you\u2019ll need to check the terms of service first. Netflix, for instance, lets you use a VPN for on-demand content but not for live events.\nYou have to know where different movies and shows are available to stream internationally\nBefore you can start streaming TV shows and films from other countries with a VPN, you\u2019ll need to know where those videos are available. The quickest way to accomplish this is by enabling your VPN, setting it to a foreign country and opening a streaming app such as Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video or Netflix.\nI prefer to use JustWatch because I can search for specific films or shows and discover where they\u2019re available. Simply look up a movie or TV show, then change your region in the Streaming in field. If you find that title on a streaming service in another country, set your VPN to that area and open that app. There's also the extremely helpful and aptly named Stream With VPN website, which taps into data from JustWatch as well as TMBD (The Movie Database) to show you where movies and shows are available to stream in different regions so you can fire up a VPN and start streaming.\nYou may find that a movie or show streaming on Disney Plus in the US but on Netflix in the UK or on Starz in Canada, for instance. You can figure out which services movies and shows are running on in different regions using JustWatch or Stream With VPN, then unblock international content libraries on Netflix, Disney Plus and other apps using a VPN. Take the exceptional Predator prequel, Prey -- which is only available on Hulu in the US. (If you have Hulu and Disney Plus subscriptions, you can watch Prey in the Disney app, but you\u2019ll need to pay for both services.) Because Prey is streaming on Disney Plus in the UK, a VPN will let you watch it on Disney Plus sans Hulu subscription.\nYou\u2019ll need a solid VPN for streaming\nTo unblock movies or shows and save money on subscriptions, you\u2019ll need one of the best VPNs for streaming:\nExpressVPN is our Editors\u2019 Choice as the best VPN overall thanks to its user-friendly design and snappy internet speeds, which are beneficial for streaming buffer-free movies or TV shows. It supports all major platforms, including the Apple TV.\nNordVPN is an excellent choice for streaming because of its solid content unblocking and blazing-fast internet speeds -- Nord was the fastest VPN of the ones we\u2019ve tested, so it\u2019s an excellent option for watching 4K videos.\nSurfshark is a great wallet-friendly VPN that doesn\u2019t break the bank or compromise on performance. Its fast internet speeds allow buttery smooth 4K streaming.\nProton VPN unblocked dozens of international Netflix libraries in my testing. Because of its comprehensive device support -- including a Linux GUI app and an Apple TV app -- it\u2019s a fantastic VPN for streaming, even on the free plan.\nA streaming device that supports VPNs makes geo-unblocking a lot easier\nWhile you can run a VPN on your computer, a streaming device makes watching videos on a TV or projector with a VPN a breeze. Amazon Fire TV devices, the Apple TV and Android TV boxes like the NVIDIA Shield all support VPN apps. Likewise, if your smart TV runs Android TV or Fire OS, you can download a VPN app directly on your television. I use an Nvidia Shield TV with Proton VPN, although I\u2019ve also got a Fire TV stick hooked up to the TV in my home office.\nHowever, other smart TV operating systems, such as Samsung\u2019s Tizen OS or LG\u2019s WebOS, don\u2019t support VPN apps. Similarly, you can\u2019t install a VPN on Rokus or game consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S/X. Instead, you\u2019ll need to run a VPN on your router -- which may void your warranty. I recommend ExpressVPN\u2019s Aircove or Aircove Go for a user-friendly whole-home router solution.\nGo forth and start streaming\nOnce you\u2019ve gotten your VPN set up on your smart TV or streaming device, you can start streaming from different platforms. For inspiration of what to fire up, check out the best new movies and TV shows on Netflix, Disney Plus, Max and more. Aside from using a VPN, you can also save money on streaming services by rotating your subscriptions, pausing services instead of canceling them and signing up for deals."

      "text": "Pros\n- Wide catalog of familiar shows and movies\n- Strong stable of kids' content from Nickelodeon\n- Live NFL football games\n- Will stream some major movies soon after theater release\nCons\n- Outside of Star Trek, Evil and 1883, not many must-see originals\n- Must have premium to get local CBS stations\nWith fall's CBS show premieres and the start of NFL season, you may be thinking about a Paramount Plus subscription. The platform houses films, popular cartoons, TV series like NCIS and live sports, making it feel like a mashup of streaming services past and present. Now that Showtime shows and movies are part of the app, you can even upgrade your experience for a few extra dollars.\nLike Netflix, Paramount Plus has an extensive library of familiar, binge-worthy series and reality shows, but with a small bucket of originals. Like Hulu, you can choose from ad-supported or more expensive ad-free plans. Like Peacock, there's a live TV component. Like Disney Plus, you'll find a lot of content for kids, in this case from Nickelodeon. Similar to Max, you'll get major movie releases that appear shortly after their theatrical premiere. All of this should add up to an exciting service with a lot to offer -- especially for the $8 entry price -- but ends up feeling like parts of all the ones you already have.\nBy the numbers, Paramount Plus has a ton of content -- 30,000 episodes of TV and 2,500 movies, plus more than three dozen original series. Yellowstone spinoff 1883 has been a hit, and it's backed up by audience favorites SEAL Team and Evil. Other series include Yellowstone spinoff 1923, a new Star Trek series and another show based on Halo.\nParents can keep kids entertained with SpongeBob, Blue's Clues, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Monster High content on the horizon. Plus, new movies like A Quiet Place: Day One typically arrive 45 days after theaters. Paramount Plus merged Showtime content into the app, giving you access to more than 600 titles if you sign up for the bundled plan.\nEven with all those additions, much of Paramount Plus' value lies in nostalgia. You can watch just about every old Nickelodeon show, including All That, Comedy Central standup specials and popular series ranging from Frasier and Cheers to SpongeBob SquarePants and Young Sheldon. You get existing originals like Star Trek Discovery and The Good Fight, as well as the live feed of your local CBS station if you spring for the $13-per-month ad-free option.\nOn the other hand, many shows you might expect, including the Paramount Network hit Yellowstone (it's on Peacock), CBS staples The Big Bang Theory (Max) and Two and a Half Men (Peacock again) are not available on Paramount Plus. It's the case with South Park, too, but the streaming service does offer exclusive originals for the show. Blame licensing.\nIf you're already a fan of any of the CBS or Viacom shows that are available -- or you're just looking to change up your streaming options -- the Paramount Plus $8-a-month Essential plan is a decent deal. If you're looking to cut back on your streaming services, it isn't a must-have on the same level as Hulu, for example, which costs the same and has much more variety and original programming.\nSelect streaming services, compared\n| Paramount Plus | Hulu | Netflix | Max | Disney Plus | Peacock | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Monthly price | Starts at $8 | Starts at $8 | Starts at $7 | Starts at $10 | Starts at $8 | Starts at $8 |\n| Ads | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Top titles | Halo, 1883, Knuckles, Star Trek: Discovery | Sh\u014dgun, The Bear, Only Murders in the Building | Stranger Things, Queen Charlotte, Squid Game | Succession, House of the Dragon, Titans | The Simpsons, The Mandalorian, Bluey | Bel-Air, Yellowstone, Love Island USA, Poker Face |\n| Mobile downloads | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| 4K HDR available | Yes | Yes | Yes (on Premium plan) | Yes | Yes | Limited |\n| Number of streams: | 3 | 2 | 2 for Standard, 4 on Premium | 2 (4 for Ultimate) | 4 | 3 |\nHow much is Paramount Plus?\nParamount Plus offers live news and sports as well as on-demand shows and movies, including originals, leaning on parent company Paramount Global brands like CBS, MTV, BET, VH1, Nickelodeon and Paramount Network, plus the Paramount Pictures movie studio. There are also more than one dozen live channels that stream curated content 24/7 and Showtime titles.\nParamount Plus costs $13 a month for the ad-free Premium subscription, or $8 a month for the ad-based Essential plan, which does not have access to your local CBS stations. For that, you'll need to subscribe to the $13-a-month plan. The service is available in the US, Canada and 18 Latin American countries.\nShowtime content is now available directly in the app, but you must upgrade to the premium Paramount Plus with Showtime plan to watch it.\nWhat you can stream on Paramount Plus\nAnecdotally, most people I know seem to have signed up for the service for two reasons: Star Trek or The Good Fight. With the Yellowstone prequel 1883, Halo, Evil and Tulsa King, they're among the most popular originals exclusive to Paramount Plus.\nAt launch, there were 20 exclusive originals -- far more than the nine titles available at Apple TV's start. Most are from familiar properties that first appeared on CBS All Access, including Jordan Peele's reboot of The Twilight Zone and The Stand. The full Star Trek catalog, including every show in the various series and originals like Discovery, Picard and Lower Decks, will likely remain a major draw for the platform. With the integration of Showtime content into the app, viewers who pay for the Paramount Plus Showtime subscription can access even more TV shows.\nOne of the biggest draws might be for kids. Nickelodeon's library of nearly 7,000 episodes of kids and family shows includes SpongeBob's CG-animated spinoff, Kamp Koral, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Paw Patrol and iCarly. Its 24-hour live channels have five selections that are kiddie-themed and feature content for preschoolers up to teens. Millennials will also find seasons of '90s shows like All That, Kenan & Kel and Are You Afraid of the Dark? It's not Disney Plus, but it's a pretty impressive collection if you're into anything Nickelodeon past or present.\nParamount Plus also integrated CBS Sports HQ, streaming more than 1,000 live sporting events per year, including the NFL on CBS, The Masters and the UEFA Champions League and Europa League. AFC fans should know that you need a Premium subscription to watch NFL games on Sundays through your local CBS affiliate. Check here to see if your region is covered for live broadcasts.\nDue to the Comedy Central connection, you'll find a large selection of standup specials. Easily navigate to this content by clicking the \"Brands\" menu, where you'll also see designated tiles for BET, CBS, Smithsonian, Nickelodeon and MTV programming.\nIn terms of other movies, the Paramount Plus collection is\u2026 varied. You have classics like Titanic, Gladiator and the Mission Impossibles, but also a whole lot of titles I'd forgotten that were in theaters in the '90s and early aughts (hello, Addams Family Values and Pulp Fiction). I did enjoy the trip down memory lane that scrolling through the available movies gave me, but I wouldn't say it's a must-have selection. Also, it's important to note that movies like the Die Hard franchise are now available through Showtime, but you need to have the Paramount Plus Showtime plan to receive access to more titles.\nIf you aren't a fan of any of those shows or movies (or sports), Paramount Plus may bring you in with some of its originals, including Beavis and Butt-Head, a revival of '90s sitcom Frasier, and a long-awaited new animated Avatar: The Last Airbender movie.\nAnother bonus: Some major Paramount movies will arrive on the streaming service about a month and a half after they premiere in theaters. Gladiator II will likely arrive on Paramount Plus to stream 45 days after it first hits theaters, and other titles include Smile 2 and Transformers One.\nWhat's it like to use Paramount Plus?\nI tested the app across an Apple TV, Roku and Amazon Fire TV Stick, along with an iPhone and Android phone, and found the experience to be largely the same across all platforms in terms of layout and content.\nParamount Plus' home page looks very similar to other streaming services: At the top, you'll see a few featured titles like on Disney Plus and Max. The continue watching row is underneath it, followed by rows for most watched movies, featured picks and then a personal watchlist. Next are genre shows recommended for you, collections, and in the middle, a row of branded tiles for networks like CBS, Showtime, Nickelodeon and MTV.\nIf you scroll to the navigation sidebar, you'll see Search, Home, along with the ability to search through movies, TV shows, live TV, collections, news and sports. Once you click on a sidebar option, a menu will appear at the top of the screen (for example, when selecting movies, you're taken to that screen with a row of genre options at the top). Overall, using the platform is straightforward and simple. Paramount Plus is available to stream at ParamountPlus.com and on most mobile devices, gaming consoles and media players.\nLet's talk 4K, downloads and parental controls\nParamount Plus supports 4K and HDR for some content if you're a Premium subscriber, which costs more. Select Roku devices support the 4K format, but Paramount Plus does not offer it for Roku version 10.5.\nYou can download up to 25 shows to your mobile device -- if you have a Premium account -- and stream on three devices at once. You can create up to six separate profiles per account, including profiles with Kids Mode turned on, and decide if you want content for younger kids (rated TV-Y) or older kids (up to TV-PG). Be sure to activate the parental controls to filter content for younger viewers. Adding a PIN will allow you to lock content based on its maturity rating, but you'll be required to enter that PIN to switch out of the kids' profile or to access restricted streams, including live channels.\nBasically, this is a functional service, but there aren't a ton of bells and whistles. For example, at launch, there was no watchlist to let you bookmark shows and movies to watch later. The service did finally add a My List feature.\nShould you try Paramount Plus?\nIf you're a fan of Star Trek, reality shows, CBS mainstays or Paramount Plus originals, having a subscription is a no-brainer -- you'll get the same content plus a whole lot more. The addition of Showtime content in the app may be worth paying the higher price if you're a fan of the network's content.\nIf you haven't subscribed and already have Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video or Disney Plus, know that this probably won't replace any of those for you. But if you are looking for some new shows or want to revisit old favorites, the $8-a-month ad-supported tier is toward the lower end of streaming service prices. It's also a content playground if you have children. And once more originals and major movie releases arrive, it could be worth your while.\nIn the meantime, if you're curious and sign up as a new member, you can try out Paramount Plus with a one-week free trial."

      "text": "Score Breakdown\nPros\n- Cutting-edge privacy and security\n- Excellent for streaming\n- Easy to use across platforms\n- Strong commitment to transparency\n- Privacy-friendly jurisdiction (British Virgin Islands)\nCons\n- Exceedingly expensive\n- No way to opt-out of potentially unneeded extra features\n- Only eight simultaneous connections\nTwo things immediately come to mind when I think of ExpressVPN. First, ExpressVPN is a juggernaut and an industry standard-bearer, especially in privacy and transparency. Second, ExpressVPN is extremely expensive for a VPN provider. For a long time, these two points coasted parallel to each other: ExpressVPN was always the \u2018pricey VPN,\u2019 but it was worth it because the service was just that good. Now, while ExpressVPN has made some big strides in key areas, the price has climbed even higher without adding proportionate value, and those parallel lines have begun heading in opposite directions.\nI ran ExpressVPN through a rigorous battery of tests over the course of several weeks in January 2025, and retested its speed performance in March. In addition to testing ExpressVPN\u2019s apps across a variety of devices and operating systems, I closely examined the company\u2019s privacy policies, corporate structure, third-party audits and security innovations. I also ran over 300 individual speed tests, checked for leaks, evaluated its streaming capabilities across various platforms and streaming services and assessed its overall value. Throughout the process, I maintained close communication with the ExpressVPN team via email as well as video conference.\nI found that while ExpressVPN is strong and continues to get stronger through cutting-edge innovations, the introduction of a major price hike to support non-VPN features has made the service a much less attractive option for the casual, budget-minded VPN user (check out our list of the best cheap VPNs if that's more your speed).\nEven so, ExpressVPN remains one of the best possible VPNs you can buy, especially if you\u2019re someone who has critical privacy needs or is looking for solid protection against future threats from quantum computers. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about ExpressVPN and whether it\u2019s the right choice for you.\nSpeed: Enhancements to Lightway and OpenVPN on Windows translate to massive improvement in speed performance\n- 18% speed loss in 2025 tests\n- Number of servers: 3,000-plus\n- Number of server locations: 105 countries\nAt the time of this review\u2019s initial publication in January, ExpressVPN\u2019s speed performance had been steadily regressing over the past few years. Years ago, ExpressVPN was the undisputed speed leader in our testing, but began a nosedive that threatened to take it out of the fastest VPN conversation altogether. In the initial round of speed tests I conducted for this review in January, 2025, I measured an average speed loss of 35% across the platforms, protocols and server locations I tested. This was after I measured an 18% speed loss in 2023 and a 25% speed loss in 2024.\nLosing 35% of your base internet speeds while connected to a VPN may not be a huge deal if you already have a fast internet connection, but if your connection is slow, then dropping more than one third of your speeds can have a noticeable impact, especially for activities like streaming. A 35% speed loss is much higher than what I\u2019d expect in 2025 from one of the best VPNs on the planet, considering NordVPN\u2019s incredible 3% speed loss, Proton VPN\u2019s 16% loss and Surfshark\u2019s 21% loss.\nHowever, ExpressVPN made some significant improvements since January to address its recent speed woes. A pair of inventive solutions on the Windows side helped transform ExpressVPN\u2019s overall speed loss from 35% to a much more respectable 18% -- the third fastest results in our 2025 testing.\nIn March 2025, ExpressVPN introduced Lightway Turbo, which now runs your Lightway connection through multiple tunnels simultaneously instead of running it through single tunnel. This helps boost speeds considerably because it allows for more data to be sent at once. ExpressVPN also concurrently rolled out Data Channel Offload for OpenVPN on Windows, which helps improve speeds by handling data packets more efficiently. In my Windows speed tests, speed loss through Lightway went from 40% in January 2025 to 17% in March 2025 and was slashed from 64% to 18% through OpenVPN over the same time period. ExpressVPN says that Lightway Turbo will be coming to MacOS and other platforms in the near future.\nOn Mac, things were more of a mixed bag. While speeds on MacOS were blazing fast through Lightway (cutting my speeds by only 8%), I was somewhat disappointed by the 29% speed loss I calculated through OpenVPN on my Mac. It\u2019s not a surprise that OpenVPN speeds were slower than Lightway, but I still lost more speed through OpenVPN than I would have expected. Unfortunately ExpressVPN\u2019s DCO solution on OpenVPN is not compatible with non-Windows devices, so hopefully engineers will work on giving OpenVPN speeds a similar boost on MacOS.\nEither way, ExpressVPN\u2019s overall speed turnaround from January to March was impressive, and indicative of the company\u2019s commitment to continuous improvement.\nExpressVPN\u2019s speed performance was generally stable across most locations and protocols. I ran speed tests from my location in Ohio on a fiber connection that gets me about 370 Mbps. Speeds to relatively closer VPN server locations like New York and the UK generally yielded the fastest results, pushing 350 to 360 Mbps on MacOS through Lightway. Speeds to Germany and France were also quite fast at around 340 Mbps. It was on servers halfway across the globe in Australia and Singapore that speeds started to drop off slightly, usually hitting around 260 to 300 Mbps.\nAnd while I did notice a fair amount of instability in my January speed tests when connecting through OpenVPN on Windows to Australia and Singapore (where speeds fluctuated from around 70 Mbps to around 120 Mbps), Lightway Turbo and DCO on OpenVPN seemed to have ironed that out, because speeds remained remarkably consistent on Windows in my latest tests. That\u2019s saying a lot because many VPNs often struggle to maintain consistent speed performance from one speed test to another.\nKey takeaway: The implementations of Lightway Turbo and DCO on OpenVPN have totally redeemed ExpressVPN\u2019s previously shaky speed performance. ExpressVPN was the third-fastest VPN we tested in 2025.\nCost: This expensive VPN just got even more expensive\n- $13 per month, $100 for the first 15 months (then $117 per year) or $140 for the first 28 months (then $150 per year)\n- 7-day free trial plus a 30-day money-back guarantee\n- Payment options: Apple Pay, Google Pay, credit card, PayPal, Bitcoin\n- Apps available for Windows, MacOS, Linux, Chromebook, Android, iOS, FireTV, Android TV, Apple TV, routers\n- Works with: Netflix, Disney Plus, Max, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV Plus and others\nExpressVPN has historically been one of the most expensive VPNs on the market. Even so, I\u2019ve maintained through the years that ExpressVPN\u2019s premium pricing was worth it because of how solid the service is from virtually every angle. Today, I\u2019d argue that the service itself is even stronger than it was a year ago\u2026 but also that ExpressVPN may no longer be worth it for a large segment of VPN users.\nToward the end of 2024, ExpressVPN introduced a few new features -- then hiked its already steep prices. The problem? It didn\u2019t add much real value in the process.\nNot too long ago, ExpressVPN cost $13 per month, $60 every six months or $100 per year. Though on the expensive side for VPN plans, I appreciated the simple pricing structure. ExpressVPN has since axed the six-month plan and added a two-year option in addition to the existing monthly and yearly plans. The monthly plan remains $13, but the pricing of the yearly and two-year plans has gotten unnecessarily complicated. The yearly plan costs $100 total for the first 15 months, but then jumps to $117 per year. The two-year plan costs $140 total for the first 28 months, but renews annually at $150 per year.\nBy comparison, you can get one year of Surfshark\u2019s base VPN plan for $48 for the first year and $79 per year afterwards. If you want something even cheaper than that without sacrificing on quality, you can get PIA for $40 for the first year (then $50 annually thereafter) or $80 every three years. Both Surfshark and PIA are excellent budget-friendly VPNs.\nThe price hike coincided with ExpressVPN\u2019s launch of Identity Defender, a suite of identity protection features that includes data removal, ID alerts, ID theft insurance and a credit scanner. The difference in pricing between ExpressVPN\u2019s yearly and two-year plans is based on what Identity Defender offers in each plan. The yearly plan includes ID theft insurance and the two-year plan includes ID theft insurance along with the data removal feature, while the monthly plan doesn't offer either.\nHowever, the CNET Money team\u2019s full deep-dive Identity Defender review characterizes the suite as a middle-of-the-road solution that\u2019s lacking compared to the leaders in the space. It notes that the features are a bonus if you\u2019re already subscribed to the VPN service.\nSure, the features can be helpful to certain users, but not everyone will want or even need the ID protection tools provided by ExpressVPN. For one, ExpressVPN offers access to free monthly credit reports -- but anyone can already get them for free every week from each of the three national credit reporting agencies. Your bank likely offers free access to your credit score anyway, too. And while identity theft insurance is great if your identity gets stolen, there are free resources available online that can also help.\nSome users might like having a basic set of identity protection features available from ExpressVPN, but it\u2019s tough to rationalize having to pay that much for features you may not want or need when all you\u2019re looking for is a VPN. Yes, I appreciate that the VPN market has been shifting toward all-in-one bundled privacy/security solutions, but most VPNs that play in that space (like NordVPN, Surfshark and Proton) have tiered subscription models that offer users more of a choice when it comes to what features and services they want with their VPN. Some users may just want a solid VPN product they can use to stream Netflix and boost their privacy online without a need for all the extras. ExpressVPN currently doesn\u2019t offer attractively priced options for that segment of users like its competitors do.\nThat said, ExpressVPN representatives tell me that the company is currently working on rolling out a new tiered pricing structure -- which will hopefully include more options for more users. That's good news, because as it stands, forcing folks to pay for features they might not want or need is a good way to steer them toward other, more affordable services.\nExpressVPN\u2019s core VPN offering is top-notch\nOtherwise, ExpressVPN hits all the right notes when it comes to delivering a top-of-the-line VPN service. Its apps are slick and easy to use across a wide variety of platforms, its privacy and security is among the best in the business and you can\u2019t get much better than ExpressVPN for streaming. It\u2019s already a top-notch VPN provider, and its core VPN offering only continues to get better.\nSo if you\u2019re not turned off by the high price, I recommend ExpressVPN for basically any online activity.\nSigning up is a breeze, and you can pay for a subscription via a variety of payment methods including credit card, PayPal, Google Pay, Apple Pay and Bitcoin. I like that ExpressVPN started offering a seven-day free trial right on its payment page. It\u2019s a move I wish more VPN providers would make because you can only access a free trial with most VPNs by signing up via Apple\u2019s App Store or the Google Play Store -- which is sort of a workaround or little known \u201chack\u201d that most VPNs don\u2019t openly advertise. By putting its seven-day free trial out in the open for anyone to access regardless of what route they take to sign up, ExpressVPN sets itself apart from the pack.\nWith ExpressVPN, you\u2019ll get apps for Windows, MacOS, Linux (GUI), Chromebook, Android, iOS, FireTV, Android TV and Apple TV. A router app is also available as well as detailed tutorials on how to set up ExpressVPN on a variety of routers. Additionally, you can purchase ExpressVPN\u2019s own Aircove or Aircove Go routers for $165 or $145, respectively, with the VPN already built in. Although ExpressVPN only allows for eight simultaneous connections (some VPNs offer up to 10 or even unlimited), going with a router setup can give you whole-network protection while only accounting for a single connection.\nAlthough ExpressVPN\u2019s apps are minimalist in design compared to others from PIA and Surfshark, you\u2019ll get all you need in a package that\u2019s simple to navigate. The Network Lock kill switch is easy to enable and works flawlessly and you can easily access options to change protocols or enable ExpressVPN\u2019s suite of Advanced Protection features that allow you to block ads, trackers, malicious sites and adult sites. The Windows and Android apps include a split-tunneling feature that worked well during my testing. ExpressVPN\u2019s Keys password manager is also available on the Android and iOS apps, along with a browser extension for use on your desktop or laptop.\nExpressVPN is solid for streaming and for travelers\nExpressVPN remains one of the best VPNs for streaming thanks to how effortlessly it cuts through regional restrictions and allows users to access virtually any streaming content from anywhere in the world.\nDuring my testing, I was able to stream content from multiple locations across various streaming services including Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, Max, Apple TV Plus and Hulu. My experience was remarkably smooth regardless of whether I was streaming content on Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, Fire TV Stick or Apple TV.\nExpressVPN is also a solid VPN for travel because it has a large network of servers spread across 105 countries, which helps ensure stable connections wherever you may be in the world. And as an added benefit for travelers, each ExpressVPN subscription plan includes the opportunity to try its new eSIM service holiday.com for free. With the monthly plan, you get 1GB eSIM data, while the yearly plan comes with 3GB and the two-year with 5GB. It\u2019s a great way to get instant access to an international data plan without the hassle of getting it set up through a local mobile carrier at your destination.\nKey takeaway: While everything is getting more expensive these days, ExpressVPN risks pricing out a core segment of its user base with the massive price hike to cover features not everyone will want or need. Ultimately, it\u2019s your money, though. If having all of these features in one place makes sense for you and you\u2019re fine with paying for them, then you\u2019re getting one of the very best VPN services on the planet -- and one that is constantly improving and innovating.\nPrivacy and security: Constantly evolving to exceed current and future privacy needs\n- Jurisdiction: British Virgin Islands\n- Encryption: AES 256-bit, ChaCha 20\n- Diskless TrustedServer technology\n- No leaks detected\n- Protocols available: Lightway, OpenVPN, IKEv2\n- Post-quantum protections\n- Regularly audited\nWhile it\u2019s an excellent all-around VPN service, privacy and security is where ExpressVPN really shines. All VPNs communicate in one way or another how user privacy is their top priority, but few actually demonstrate that commitment as evidently and consistently as ExpressVPN.\nPerhaps what I admire most about ExpressVPN is that it refuses to rest on its laurels. Instead, the ExpressVPN team is always seeking new ways to enhance user privacy -- not just for today, but for the future. As a forward-thinking provider, it stays on the cutting edge, setting the standard for what a VPN should do to protect its users.\nIn October 2023, ExpressVPN became one of the first VPN providers to offer post-quantum protections. Since then, ExpressVPN has doubled- and tripled-down on its commitment to providing protection against future privacy risks from quantum computers by continuing to roll out stronger post quantum encryption standards. Most other VPNs are still playing catch-up -- if they\u2019ve even entered the space at all.\nEarly this year, ExpressVPN took a significant step in beefing up its security standards by integrating ML-KEM -- the latest NIST standard for post-quantum encryption -- into the Lightway protocol. And by taking a hybrid approach and pairing the latest in post-quantum protections with today\u2019s leading encryption, ExpressVPN can help ensure user privacy is protected to the highest of standards today and well into the future. ExpressVPN\u2019s post-quantum protection is integrated into Lightway across all platforms, so all you need to do to reap its benefits is download the latest version of the app and connect to the VPN using the Lightway protocol.\nIn addition to being the industry leader in post-quantum protections, ExpressVPN is one of the standard-bearers for how a VPN should approach transparency. The VPN industry is based on trust. When you use a VPN, you\u2019re essentially swapping out your ISP for your VPN as the entity that can have eyes on your internet activity. Therefore, you need to put a ton of trust in your VPN that it won\u2019t log and share your data like your ISP does (many VPNs, unfortunately, do not uphold that standard). From my experience with ExpressVPN over the years, it\u2019s one of the VPNs I trust the most. This is because the company goes well above and beyond to build that trust and communicate transparently about the steps it takes to protect users.\nExpressVPN has an extensive Trust Center that offers a wealth of information detailing everything it takes to uphold its commitment to security and user privacy. One of the most impressive components of ExpressVPN\u2019s Trust Center is the section that links to the VPN\u2019s long list of independent audits. While most other VPNs that commission third-party audits have maybe a handful under their belt, ExpressVPN has undergone 22 independent audits -- far outpacing the competition.\nAt CNET, we typically like to see VPN providers commission an audit at least once a year. ExpressVPN undergoes multiple audits every year, and the team told me that they\u2019ve already queued up several audits for 2025. While independent audits aren\u2019t infallible and can only confirm the VPN\u2019s status during the audit process itself, they serve as a critical trust signal that can help bolster a VPN\u2019s claim that it\u2019s doing what it says it does.\nExpressVPN promises not to keep any logs of your online activity while using its service.\n\u201cWe do not collect logs of your online activity while you are connected to our Services, including no logging of browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries,\u201d states ExpressVPN\u2019s privacy policy. \u201cWe also never store connection logs, meaning no logs of your IP address, your outgoing VPN IP address, connection timestamp, or session duration.\u201d\nThis promise has been scrutinized by independent auditing firms over the years and will likely face continued review in the future. A VPN\u2019s no-logs claims are also impossible to verify with 100% certainty, but audits (and legal cases) can help bolster the veracity of those claims.\nA VPN that doesn\u2019t log user activity has no useful data to hand over to authorities, even if served with a warrant or subpoena. I appreciate that ExpressVPN has started publishing a bi-annual transparency report included in its Trust Center detailing the number of legal requests it receives every six months. Out of the hundreds of thousands of requests for user data received over the past six months, ExpressVPN reports that none of the requests resulted in the disclosure of user-related data.\nIt\u2019s no accident that ExpressVPN has established itself in the British Virgin Islands, a privacy friendly jurisdiction that sits outside of the 14-Eyes alliance and doesn\u2019t impose data retention laws. I appreciate the clarity with which ExpressVPN\u2019s privacy policy articulates how user data is managed under its BVI jurisdiction: \u201cYour Personal Data is controlled by and stored under ExpressVPN, and not by its ultimate holding company, Kape Technologies PLC (UK) or other related entities. Express Technologies Ltd. operates under BVI jurisdiction, in accordance with BVI laws... Consequently, any demand via legal means for Personal Data (or other types of data) is subject to BVI jurisdiction and laws. We fight vigorously to defend our rights (and those of our users) if an attempt is made to bypass the privacy protections provided for by the BVI. A parent, subsidiary, or related entity cannot be compelled to, nor would it voluntarily, provide Personal Data stored by Express Technologies Ltd.\u201d\nAlong with its no-logs policy, one of ExpressVPN\u2019s core privacy protections is rooted in its TrustedServer technology, which builds upon the basics of a diskless server infrastructure. With RAM-only diskless servers, there is theoretically nowhere for data to reside like it does on a traditional hard disk. And whenever a server is shut down or rebooted, all data is completely wiped. TrustedServer takes this a step further and reinstalls the entire software stack with each server reboot, which ensures consistency and helps mitigate risks associated with misconfiguration. (Though if ExpressVPN doesn\u2019t log its users\u2019 online activity, there shouldn\u2019t be any useful data on the servers anyway.) Still, ensuring its servers run on volatile memory is about as foolproof as you can get.\nExpressVPN\u2019s privacy features worked well during my tests. The kill switch did what the kill switch is supposed to do, and I detected no leaks of any sort on any of ExpressVPN\u2019s apps. Last year, I detected DNS leaks while connected to ExpressVPN\u2019s Windows client with its split-tunneling feature enabled. However, I\u2019m happy to have encountered no such leaks since ExpressVPN engineers took quick and decisive action to fix the issue after I reported it. The rapid resolution and the thorough, transparent nature with which ExpressVPN handled the issue last year is a testament to how committed the team is to protecting users.\nA couple of other recent enhancements I like include the ShuffleIP feature and the cipher selection feature. ShuffleIP works constantly in the background and automatically, switching your IP address randomly every few minutes without disconnecting you from the VPN. This helps boost your privacy by making it even more difficult for others to track you online. Surfshark also includes a similar feature, but you need to enable it separately with Surfshark rather than having it on by default and automatically working in the background with ExpressVPN. The cipher selection feature allows Android and iOS users to switch the cipher between ChaCha 20 or AES 256-GCM when using Lightway. This is great for power users who want more granular control over their connection or users who might be experiencing performance issues on older devices and could benefit from switching the cipher.\nKey takeaway: ExpressVPN has consistently demonstrated that it\u2019s one of the best in the business when it comes to privacy and security. All VPNs claim that user privacy is their top priority, but ExpressVPN is one of the few that actually backs it up with concrete actions. ExpressVPN is a trustworthy VPN service that I can confidently recommend for folks with critical privacy needs.\nExpressVPN continues to raise the bar\nYeah, it\u2019s expensive and the pricing structure is somewhat bizarre. But ExpressVPN remains one of the best VPNs in the world because it excels at virtually everything that a VPN service should be doing. And the service only keeps getting better. ExpressVPN is constantly innovating and setting the standard for how VPNs can protect user privacy. I\u2019m impressed by ExpressVPN\u2019s commitment to transparency as much as I am by its forward-thinking approach to privacy.\nExpressVPN's standing as one of the best VPNs for streaming has only gotten stronger with its massive upgrade in speed performance. I'm hopeful that the company's forthcoming re-tooled pricing structure represents a similar upgrade and better aligns with the needs of the average user who\u2019s just looking for something that can hide their activity from their ISP and unblock streaming content. The current pricing structure seems to neglect that segment and as a result, casual VPN users may be more inclined to opt for a more budget-friendly service like Surfshark or Proton VPN.\nBut if you\u2019re okay with paying a premium for an excellent all-around VPN service that you can trust to protect you in privacy-critical situations and you see yourself benefitting from all of the extra ID protection features, then ExpressVPN is a solid choice."

Surfshark is fast, excellent for streaming and has an Apple TV app that looks great and is simple to use.\nProton VPN offers an Apple TV app that's light on features, but delivers exceptional unblocking performance, among the best I experienced in my testing.\nPIA is one of the best cheap VPNs for Apple TV streaming devices. Its TVOS app is neatly minimalistic in the same vein as ExpressVPN\u2019s, and its streaming performance is right up there in the same category, making it an excellent alternative for budget-conscious users.\nAbout VPNs for Apple TV\nApple added native VPN support to Apple TV in 2023 with the release of TVOS 17. That means Apple TV now natively supports VPN apps, so you can download and install your preferred VPN directly from the App Store, just like you would on an iPhone or iPad.\nWhen you connect to a VPN, your internet traffic is routed through an encrypted tunnel to a server in a different city, state or country of your choosing. This keeps your streaming activity hidden from your ISP and other online snoops, while also making it appear as though you're streaming from a different location. That\u2019s especially handy for getting more out of streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Disney Plus. Many shows and movies on these streaming platforms are restricted to specific countries due to licensing agreements, but a VPN gives you the ability to bypass those geographic restrictions. By using your VPN's IP address, your online traffic can appear as though it's originating from another country, allowing you to unlock content that would normally be unavailable in your current region.\nAlthough more and more VPN companies are rolling out Apple TV apps, overall quality and value can vary greatly from provider to provider. Each of the VPN apps for Apple TV I've highlighted here are easy to use, fast and excellent for unblocking geo-restricted streaming content across a wide variety of streaming services. Following my latest tests and analysis, ExpressVPN retains its top spot as the best VPN for Apple TV, thanks to its easy-to-use app and flawless unblocking performance. Separately, I have bumped Proton VPN up into the top picks for Apple TV based on its exceptional international streaming capabilities, fast speeds and large server network. Conversely, I pulled IPVanish from the list because (although its Apple TV app is serviceable) I cannot recommend the provider on account of its inadequate transparency in relation to its staggeringly overpriced renewal rates. Read on to learn more about Apple TV VPNs.\nFactors to consider in a VPN for Apple TV\nBased on my experience and research with VPNs, these are the most important factors to consider when deciding which VPN to choose for Apple TV.\nStreaming capabilities\nWhen using a VPN on your Apple TV, you'll most likely want to be able to access geographically restricted streaming content. But just because a VPN has servers in a specific region doesn't necessarily mean that it will give you access to streaming content from that region. Performance can vary greatly from one provider to another, so if the VPN you're using struggles to give you access to content from the regions and streaming providers you want, then you may want to switch to a different VPN. Most VPNs offer money-back guarantees of usually around 30 days, which can give you a chance to try a few providers to see which one works best for you before fully committing.\nSpeed\nUsing a VPN will slow your internet speeds, sometimes even by 50% or more. You\u2019ll want a fast VPN to ensure a buffer-free experience streaming movies and shows on your Apple TV. With a fast VPN, you can expect your speeds to drop only by about 25% or less, which is barely noticeable if you have a fast connection to begin with. Netflix recommends that you have at least a 15Mbps connection to stream in 4K, but you'll probably need closer to at least 50Mbps for a smooth 4K streaming experience, especially if you have multiple devices connected to your network.\nUsability\nYour VPN for Apple TV should be simple to use, easy to navigate and quick to connect. You don\u2019t want your Apple TV VPN app to have an awkward layout that makes servers a pain to locate when you\u2019re using your remote to navigate the app. You need an app that quickly connects to a server and runs in the background while you enjoy your shows and movies. If it\u2019s any more complicated than that, your VPN is doing it wrong.\nPrivacy\nPrivacy is an important consideration for any VPN use case, including streaming on Apple TV devices. When you use a VPN on your Apple TV, your traffic is encrypted and your ISP and other online snoops won't be able to monitor your streaming activity. You\u2019ll want to use a trustworthy VPN that has a strong track record of protecting user privacy. Always look through a VPN\u2019s privacy policy with special attention to its data collection and sharing practices. Also, look into the VPN\u2019s independent audit history, transparency reports and any legal action it has been involved in to get a sense of how trustworthy it is when it comes to protecting your privacy.\nPrice\nFor most of us, price is an important factor in the majority of things we purchase, including VPNs. A VPN can cost anywhere from $5 to $15 per month or $40 to more than $150 per year, so there are VPNs available for basically any budget. You might be tempted to go straight for a more expensive VPN, but that\u2019s not necessarily the best approach when looking for an Apple TV VPN. A premium price doesn\u2019t always mean better service. Even if a VPN has a thousand bells and whistles attached, it doesn\u2019t matter if the actual Apple TV VPN app isn\u2019t up to scratch. Some of the best VPNs for Apple TV devices are actually pretty cheap.\nServer network\nIf you want to unblock streaming content from multiple regions on your Apple TV, you\u2019ll want your VPN\u2019s server network to include servers in a wide range of countries. Some VPNs have servers in over 100 countries, while some only have about 50. More countries will give you more choices when it comes to unblocking international streaming content, but it\u2019s more important for your VPN to have servers in the specific countries you want. Visit the VPN\u2019s website to check its server locations and make sure it has servers in the regions you want to unblock streaming content from on your Apple TV.\nHow I tested VPNs for Apple TV\nTo determine the best VPNs for Apple TV, I paid close attention to how easy each VPN app was to navigate and interact with. Are the server locations easy to locate and arranged in an organized manner? Is the app design clean and easily understandable for beginner VPN users? Is the app responsive and does it connect quickly? Does the VPN give me access to a wide variety of streaming content from different streaming providers across various international server locations?\nThe main part of my testing procedure involved evaluating how each VPN performed when streaming on Apple TV. I tested the VPN apps with some of the most popular streaming providers, including Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video. I connected via various server locations across the globe to check each VPN\u2019s unblocking capabilities on different streaming platforms and noted how quickly streaming content loaded up and played. I also took into account each VPN\u2019s speed performance, privacy posture and overall value -- all factors that play a role in how we test VPNs at CNET.\nOther VPNs I tested on Apple TV\nNordVPN\nNordVPN is an excellent VPN, but if you plan to use it on your Apple TV, you might end up disappointed. During my testing of NordVPN\u2019s Apple TV app, I encountered error messages on every single title I attempted to stream on every foreign Netflix library I tried accessing. During my initial tests, Hulu detected the VPN and blocked my access to its content even though I was connecting through US servers, but I was able to access content on Hulu through NordVPN's Apple TV app during my latest tests, which was a welcome improvement. Disney Plus, Apple TV Plus, Amazon Prime Video and US Netflix worked fine. Still, streaming is the main reason the vast majority of people opt for a VPN on Apple TV, and if NordVPN can\u2019t quite get it right for key services like Netflix, I suggest passing on it for a VPN that can.\nIn my experience, NordVPN\u2019s Apple TV app also isn\u2019t nearly as user-friendly as most of the competition. Browsing for servers is a pain because you have no choice but to side-scroll through a list of servers that are arranged in no discernible order. For a VPN with servers in 126 different countries, this user interface choice is baffling. Alternatively, you can search for a specific server, but the server locations don\u2019t begin to populate until you enter the third letter of your search. These are, admittedly minor inconveniences, but still, a thumbs down from me on usability and unwelcome in conjunction with its other struggles.\nI wholeheartedly recommend NordVPN as a solid option for basically anything else, but not for Apple TV, even if its streaming performance was slightly better in my latest tests.\nPrivadoVPN\nPrivadoVPN is a relatively new VPN provider that's been making headway in the industry over the past few years. It's not a top pick, but its Apple TV app is a decent option for casual users who just want to stream content. I like how the app makes it possible to browse for servers based on latency, which can help you potentially find optimally performing servers and ensure your streaming experience remains smooth. You can also designate favorite servers and browse locations alphabetically, but strangely there\u2019s no option to search for server locations. In any case, the app connected instantly during my tests and streaming was always buffer-free, despite PrivadoVPN\u2019s lackluster speed performance during our most recent speed tests.\nPrivadoVPN offers a free plan that\u2019s okay for casual internet browsing, but I don\u2019t recommend it for streaming on Apple TV or any other device because of its 10GB monthly limit (which is about enough to stream one or two movies per month). If that\u2019s enough for you, then give it a shot. During my tests, PrivadoVPN\u2019s free tier failed to give me access to both Netflix and Disney Plus streaming content -- although I was able to stream Amazon Prime Video, Hulu and Apple TV Plus content on the free plan. With the paid plan, I was able to access streaming content on each of those streaming services as well as on Netflix and Disney Plus. PrivadoVPN\u2019s premium tier gives you access to servers in 49 countries, which isn't terribly impressive compared to providers like ExpressVPN and NordVPN, but PrivadoVPN makes up for it with some pretty cheap initial prices. At $11 per month, the monthly plan is nothing to write home about, but the first year only costs $20 and a two-year plan is $30. These are exceptional savings, but be warned as these are only introductory prices. The yearly plan renews at $60, whereas the two-year plan renews at $96 every two years.\nIPVanish\nIPVanish's Apple TV app performed adequately during my tests, with an easy-to-navigate interface and instantaneous connections. I found it a welcome departure from its otherwise clunky app on other platforms. You can quickly connect to an Optimal Location, search for a specific location or browse country and city server locations alphabetically. I also like how you can quickly access a list of recently used locations and your bank of favorite servers. IPVanish\u2019s Apple TV app connects via IKEv2 without any option to change protocols. As with other TVOS VPN apps, you won\u2019t really find any other settings to play around with.\nI was able to use IPVanish\u2019s Apple TV app to stream content on popular streaming platforms like Netflix, Disney Plus, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV Plus. Streams were reliably smooth and buffer-free whether I connected to a server close by or on the other side of the globe. Overall, IPVanish\u2019s performance and streaming capabilities on Apple TV were satisfactory during my tests. IPVanish is a decent choice if all you want to do is use it on your Apple TV, but I ultimately cannot recommend it as a top pick because of its absurd pricing and because it doesn't offer anything noteworthy that sets it apart from its more reasonably priced competitors. IPVanish costs $13 per month, $40 for the first year or $52 for the first two years combined. But what IPVanish doesn't make adequately clear during the checkout process is that the yearly plan skyrockets to a ridiculous $156 per year after the introductory term and the two-year plan renews at an equally preposterous $312 every two years. A 30-day money-back guarantee is available on the annual and two-year plans, but IPVanish doesn't offer any guarantee on its monthly plan. (Disclaimer: IPVanish is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis).\nVPNs for Apple TV FAQ\nCan I use a free VPN for Apple TV?\nTechnically, you can use a free VPN for Apple TV, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend doing so. Although it may be tempting, using a free VPN to stream content on Apple TV will most likely result in a disappointing streaming experience. This is because free VPNs aren\u2019t typically optimized for streaming. Aside from the fact that free VPNs usually impose limits on usage, you\u2019ll likely encounter much slower speeds than you would with a paid VPN. You probably won\u2019t be allotted enough data to stream all that you want, and there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll have to contend with unsatisfactory picture quality and/or buffering while doing so. Additionally, free VPNs can often be risky since they may collect your data and sell it to third parties, or worse, be infected with malware.\nHow do I set up a VPN on Apple TV?\nSetting up a VPN on Apple TV is simple. Just navigate to the App Store on your Apple TV device, search for your VPN provider and download the app just like you would any other app. Once you\u2019ve signed in to your Apple TV VPN app, connect to your desired server and start streaming.\nIs my Apple TV compatible with VPN?\nAs long as your Apple TV device is running TVOS 17 or later, it\u2019s compatible with VPN apps. Apple TV HD (released in 2015) devices and later can support TVOS 17. To check your TVOS version, navigate to Settings > General > About. If your TVOS version isn\u2019t 17 or above, you\u2019ll need to update your device by going to Settings > System > Software Updates > Update Software.\nCan a VPN unblock all streaming content on Apple TV devices?\nA VPN probably won\u2019t be able to unblock all streaming content on Apple TV devices. Different streaming providers have different approaches regarding whether they actively try to prevent VPN users from accessing their content. Some VPNs can get around active blocking attempts and some have trouble doing so. It\u2019s often a cat-and-mouse situation between streaming services and VPNs trying to unblock their content, so a VPN that works today on a specific streaming site might not tomorrow and vice versa. Some VPNs are better than others at staying on top of the streaming game and are able to reliably unblock content on various streaming services."

It effortlessly unblocks Netflix and other popular streaming services like Disney Plus and Amazon Prime Video. The ExpressVPN app -- available for nearly every platform, including dedicated streaming devices like Android TV, Fire TV and Apple TV -- is incredibly easy to use, making it a great choice for VPN beginners.\nNordVPN is the fastest VPN for streaming, with superb reliability and broad device compatibility, including an Apple TV app. We measured a mere 3% speed loss in our latest speed tests with NordVPN, making it excellent for 4K video streaming. It also has a unique feature called Meshnet that you may be able to use to stream more easily while traveling.\nSurfshark is the best value VPN for streaming. Its excellent speeds are great for streaming movies or shows in 4K. It also has apps for tons of streaming devices, including Apple TV, Fire TV and Android TV. You may be able to utilize Surfshark's unique GPS spoofer feature on Android to unblock certain streaming services that use GPS for geo-location, like YouTube TV.\nProton VPN is the most versatile VPN for streaming. It offers a free plan that's decent for streaming and doesn't impose any limits on speeds or usage. But Proton VPN's premium tier is one of the best options for streaming, thanks to its fast speeds, excellent geo-unblocking capabilities and expansive global network of servers.\nWhy you should use a VPN for streaming\nA virtual private network can be your all-access pass to streaming content from all over the world. VPNs encrypt your internet traffic and route it through a VPN server in a separate location, changing your IP address in the process. This keeps your online activity private, hides your true IP address and can make apps and websites register your connection as originating in a different city, state or even country.\nDue to regional licensing agreements, streaming sites like Amazon Prime Video, Max, Disney Plus and Hulu all have unique content libraries that vary by region. Using a VPN can help you access those region-specific libraries. For instance, if you want to access your home Netflix library while traveling outside of the US, you can connect to a US-based VPN server and access the content as if you were at home. Alternatively, you'll be able to access international content that is not normally available in your region. All you need to do is click or tap on the country location you want to stream content from in the VPN app and you're good to go. Changing your virtual location with a VPN can also help you cut through regional sports broadcast blackouts or even save you money on streaming subscriptions.\nPicking the right streaming VPN allows you to keep up with new releases and global content without being locked into one regional catalog. However, not all VPNs are equally capable when it comes to streaming. Many streaming services have systems in place to detect and block VPN usage. That\u2019s why choosing the right streaming VPN is crucial. As CNET\u2019s VPN experts, we've rigorously tested a wide range of VPN services over the years, putting them through their paces to see how they perform when it comes to factors like speed, usability, reliability, privacy and streaming.\nWhen evaluating a VPN's streaming capabilities, we test how smoothly the VPN is able to unblock regional streaming content from a wide variety of streaming services through various international server locations across different platforms like mobile, desktop and dedicated streaming devices. Based on that testing, we've designated ExpressVPN as our top pick for the best VPN for streaming, but NordVPN and Surfshark are both worthy alternatives.\nFactors to consider in a VPN for streaming: How to choose the right VPN\nBased on our years of experience using and testing VPNs, here's what you should consider when choosing a VPN for streaming.\nStreaming capabilities\nYour VPN\u2019s capacity to access streaming content is the top factor to consider in a VPN for streaming. If your VPN can\u2019t access geo-restricted streaming content, it isn\u2019t fit for this purpose. It\u2019s also important to make sure that the VPN you choose works well for the specific streaming services you want to access. Think about the streaming services you want to watch like Netflix, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, Max, Hulu, Peacock, Crunchyroll, YouTube TV and Sling -- then try your VPN with those services to see if it works. We've found that ExpressVPN, NordVPN and Surfshark all work reliably with each of those streaming services across most platforms.\nKeep in mind that a streaming service that works with a specific VPN today may not tomorrow (and vice versa). Sometimes a simple server switch can do the trick and get you access to the content you're looking for. If not, you can alert your VPN's support team to the issue and they may be able to get it resolved. Each of these VPNs will give you your money back within 30 days of purchase, so if it happens to not work as well as you want, you can get a refund. Check out the best VPNs for Netflix and the best VPNs for Amazon Prime Video for more information.\nSpeed\nYour VPN\u2019s speed performance plays a major role in the overall quality of your streaming experience. You\u2019ll need a VPN that\u2019s fast, especially if you\u2019re streaming in 4K or if you\u2019re accessing geo-blocked content from a region that\u2019s a considerable distance from your physical location. Generally, you'll need download speeds of 25Mbps at a bare minimum for 4K streaming, but you'll want at least 50Mbps for reliable 4K streaming. You can get by with far less (10-20Mbps) for HD streaming. All VPNs will slow your speeds somewhat (sometimes by 50% or more), but if your VPN is slowing your connection too much, you may end up experiencing a lot of buffering or lower-quality video playback. A fast streaming VPN will only reduce your download speeds minimally -- ideally by 25% or less on average. As long as your connection is fast enough to begin with, the speed loss shouldn't be noticeable.\nPrivacy\nRegardless of what you\u2019re using your VPN for, privacy is a key consideration for any VPN service. Your VPN should have privacy measures in place, like DNS leak protection, a kill switch, modern encryption protocols and a no-logs policy (ideally one that\u2019s been audited or tested in the wild). A VPN that provides the necessary privacy protections will ensure that your internet traffic is never leaked unencrypted.\nNetwork\nA good VPN for streaming should have a network of servers in locations across the globe. If you\u2019re looking to fully optimize your streaming and get access to the largest selection of streaming content, then you\u2019ll probably want to choose a VPN with servers located in the largest number of countries. If you\u2019re looking to access content from a specific region, you should check to ensure the VPN you want to use has servers in the region(s) you need. You can check the VPN\u2019s server page on its website to see what countries it has servers in before purchasing a subscription. Most of our top picks feature thousands of servers in 100-plus countries. To unblock streaming content from a specific country, all you need to do is use the VPN app to connect to a server located in the country from which you want to stream content. For example, to access the US Netflix library, ensure you're connected to a server in the US. Or if you want to access content on BBC iPlayer, connect to a UK server.\nDevice compatibility\nYou\u2019ll also want to make sure that the streaming VPN you choose is compatible with the device on which you want to stream content, whether that\u2019s a mobile device, laptop, smart TV or streaming device. Most VPNs are compatible with a wide range of devices, but it\u2019s always a good idea to confirm that the service you\u2019re considering will work with your device. Many VPNs have apps for Fire TV and Android TV that work on streaming devices or smart TVs, but not every provider has an Apple TV app yet. NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Surfshark, Proton VPN, PIA and IPVanish are a few of the providers that do have Apple TV apps. (Disclosure: IPVanish is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.) Luckily, you can use a VPN on your router if you want to use a VPN with devices like PlayStation 5 and Xbox consoles or Roku streaming devices that don't support native VPN apps.\nRouter installation\nIt isn't necessary to use a router to stream geo-blocked content with a VPN, but it can help if your smart TV or streaming device doesn't natively support VPN apps. Also, with a VPN router setup, you can protect all of the devices on your network at once while using only one of your allotted simultaneous connections. Installing a VPN on a compatible router can be difficult and even risky if you try it yourself, so be sure you have the technical know-how to do so before proceeding. Alternatively, you can purchase a router with a VPN preinstalled from a company like FlashRouters. If you're an ExpressVPN user, you can purchase the provider's Aircove router or use its intuitive router app on your existing VPN-compatible router.\nCost\nVPN prices can vary considerably from one provider to another. A monthly VPN subscription can range anywhere from about $5 to $15 per month. Longer-term VPN subscription plans often feature introductory pricing around $40 to $100 for the first year. But be aware that renewal prices can sometimes double or even quadruple -- with VPN renewal pricing coming in anywhere from $50 to $150 or more per year after introductory term. If you're on a budget, take a look at our list of the best cheap VPNs. You can even use a VPN to save money on your streaming subscriptions because a VPN can help you access more global content without you having to subscribe to as many streaming services.\nSports streaming\nIf you're a sports fan, you can use a VPN to avoid regional blackouts and stream sports from anywhere. To do so, just connect to a VPN server in a location where the sporting event is accessible online -- whether it\u2019s a specific U.S. city, or a different country -- and you should be able to stream all the sports you want. For instance, you can use a VPN to stream out-of-market NFL games or watch NFL matches while traveling abroad.\nHow we test VPNs for streaming\nWe know choosing a VPN for streaming can be a tall task, so we thoroughly tested different providers using different streaming services on several platforms. For each VPN, we evaluated each provider\u2019s streaming performance on mobile, desktop and dedicated streaming devices like Amazon\u2019s Fire TV Stick and Apple TV. After evaluating how easy it was to navigate each VPN app, we connected to dozens of server locations (including the US, UK, Australia, Japan, Egypt, France, Germany and Canada) with each VPN to determine if the service was able to unblock geo-restricted content from different regions around the world on streaming services such as Netflix, Disney Plus, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video.\nWe noted whenever a VPN was blocked from accessing certain geo-restricted content, and we checked to make sure the VPN connections were fast enough for streaming in 4K and that the streaming experience was smooth and free of buffering when a VPN was able to successfully stream content. Each VPN we\u2019ve listed here is a capable VPN for streaming, but one may work better for you than another, based on your particular needs or budget. Each VPN here also offers a money-back guarantee, so you can try them out before you fully commit to one.\nOther VPNs we tested\nPrivate Internet Access\nThe wallet-friendly Private Internet Access, or PIA, is an open-source VPN provider with a strong focus on privacy. PIA costs just $12 monthly, $40 for the first year (the one-year plan renews at $50 annually) or $79 every three years. Although PIA worked well enough for Netflix and Disney Plus, it struggled with Amazon Prime Video. PIA has apps for nearly every platform, including Windows, MacOS, Linux (with a GUI that's more beginner-friendly than a command-line interface), web browsers, iOS/iPadOS, Android/Android TV and Apple TV.\nDespite its affordability compared with many VPN rivals, PIA is tough to recommend for streaming because of its middle-of-the-road speed performance. In our testing, we clocked an underwhelming 49% average speed loss. Folks with fast internet speeds (50 megabits per second or more) should be fine, but slower or more unreliable internet connections like satellite internet might not work as well. (For reference, Netflix recommends a minimum 15Mbps download speed for a single 4K video stream.) Ultimately, PIA is a fantastic VPN with strong privacy features, but its streaming shortcomings limit its appeal for VPN users who want to unblock a wide selection of streaming content.\nIPVanish\nIPVanish is a decent VPN for streaming if you\u2019re new to VPNs and want a solution that\u2019s simple to use and can help you watch content on various streaming platforms. During our testing, we were able to access Netflix libraries from a handful of regions, along with content on Hulu, Amazon Prime Video and Disney Plus. Although some VPNs may struggle to deliver across platforms, we were able to access each of the streaming services we tested on each of the devices we tested them on with IPVanish. The main area where IPVanish struggles is its speed. The inconsistency of IPVanish\u2019s speeds -- we clocked a high 44% average speed loss in our 2024 tests -- may put a damper on your streaming experience, especially while watching 4K ultra-high-definition videos.\nA monthly subscription to IPVanish costs $13 per month, which is on par with many other VPNs, but its annual plan starts off cheaper than both NordVPN and ExpressVPN at $40 for the first year. IPVanish offers a two-year plan that costs $52 total for the first two years combined. Beware that the one-year and two-year plan prices skyrocket to an absurd $156 per year or $312 total every two years after the initial one- or two-year term. Although IPVanish's renewal prices are only slightly more expensive than ExpressVPN's and NordVPN's similarly excessive renewal prices, IPVanish's unremarkable feature set, average overall performance and sluggish speeds make it comparably unattractive and not an ideal choice for streaming enthusiasts. (Disclosure: IPVanish is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis).\nMullvad\nMullvad is an excellent choice for privacy-conscious VPN users and posted a reasonable 24% average speed loss in our latest testing. It worked well with Netflix, Disney Plus and Hulu, but it struggled with streaming Amazon Prime Video during our tests and doesn't offer full, native support for smart TVs or streaming devices like Amazon Fire TV Stick or Apple TV. That, in combination with its comparatively small network of servers in just 49 countries, makes Mullvad a tough sell for folks wanting to use the VPN for streaming purposes.\nMullvad requires zero personal information to sign up -- not even an email address -- and costs a flat fee of $5 per month whether you use it for a month, a year or five years. You can pay for and add as many months to your account as you want, but Mullvad doesn't have recurring subscriptions of any sort because it strives to collect as little data as possible. If you're not satisfied with the service, then you can request a refund within the first 30 days of purchase."

However, geographical restrictions can limit the content available to watch in your region. Due to regional licensing agreements, streaming services can only offer a certain selection of titles in a specific country. For instance, if you're traveling to another country, your favorite shows and movies that you stream at home may not be available to watch in the country you're visiting.\nHowever, with a VPN, you can route your internet traffic through an encrypted server to hide your public IP address, which can make it look like you're in another city, state or country. Because most streaming sites typically rely on your IP address to determine your location (and therefore what content to deliver), changing your IP address to make it appear as though you're in a different country using a VPN on your Fire TV Stick can help you unblock region-restricted content from all over the world that wouldn't normally be available in your location. A VPN can help you unblock international content from streaming services like Netflix, Disney Plus, HBO Max, Amazon Prime Video and BBC iPlayer, in addition to accessing your home streaming libraries while you're out of the country. So you can enjoy Squid Game on Netflix or Another Simple Favor on Amazon Prime Video from anywhere around the globe. Because the VPN encrypts your traffic, you can keep your Fire TV Stick streaming activity private from your ISP and potentially bypass bandwidth throttling which might slow down your internet speeds.\nThe best VPNs for Fire TV Stick all have intuitive apps that you can download directly to your device. However, one may work better for you than another, depending on your budget and the specific streaming content you want to access. Based on my hours of testing several VPN services in my latest evaluations, ExpressVPN retains its standing as the best Fire TV Stick VPN available in 2025, thanks in large part to its incredible ease of use and impressive unblocking capabilities across regions and streaming services. Read on to learn more about what to look for in the best VPNs for Fire TV Stick.\nHow to choose the right VPN: Factors to consider in a Fire TV Stick VPN\nPrivacy\nIf you want to keep your viewing activities on your Fire TV Stick hidden from your ISP, then you\u2019ll want a VPN that delivers on privacy. Generally, you want to use a provider that offers AES-256 over OpenVPN, or ChaCha20 over Wireguard, to be sure that your internet traffic is being encrypted in a secure way. Be sure to check the VPN provider\u2019s privacy policy to see what personal information may be collected, who it\u2019s shared with and how it\u2019s protected. Do some research into any privacy or security incidents that the VPN company may have dealt with in the past. Look into the provider\u2019s no-logs policy and check for any third-party no-logs audits or real-life cases where the provider\u2019s no-logs claims were put to the test. Also, you\u2019ll want to make sure the VPN has a kill switch and DNS leak protection to ensure your traffic doesn\u2019t leak unencrypted.\nSpeed\nNothing\u2019s worse than constant buffering when you\u2019re trying to stream movies or shows with your Fire TV Stick. You\u2019ll need a fast VPN to ensure a smooth streaming experience, especially if you\u2019re streaming in 4K. Keep in mind that a VPN will slow your internet speeds, sometimes by 50% or more -- although, the fastest VPNs we tested slowed our base speeds by an average of only 20% or less. With a VPN that cuts your internet speeds by 20% or less, you\u2019ll probably hardly notice the speed reduction, and your speeds should be sufficient for streaming on your Fire TV Stick (provided your base internet speeds are fast enough to begin with). Netflix recommends speeds of at least 5Mbps for high-definition streaming, whereas 4K content needs at least 15Mbps. But for a smooth and stable 4K streaming experience, your speeds should be closer to 50Mbps.\nStreaming and unblocking capabilities\nMost VPNs advertise that they\u2019re great for streaming, but the reality is that there are only a few out there that are truly great streaming VPNs. It\u2019s more than likely that you\u2019ll be spending a lot of time streaming TV shows and movies using your Amazon Fire TV device, so you need a VPN that can keep up. This doesn\u2019t just mean that it\u2019s fast -- you\u2019re also looking for a VPN that has plenty of servers around the world to give you more choice when it comes to unblocking streaming services around the world. You\u2019ll also want to make sure that a VPN has the ability to unblock content on streaming services like Netflix, Disney Plus, HBO Max, Hulu, BBC iPlayer and Amazon Prime Video. The best way to do this is to test it out by taking advantage of a money-back guarantee. If the VPN works and unblocks the stream you want, great. If not, you can ask for a refund and try a different VPN provider.\nUsability\nJust because a VPN has a dedicated app for Amazon\u2019s Fire TV Stick, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it\u2019s a good VPN for the device. You\u2019ll want your VPN to be easy to use on your Fire TV Stick. The app should be similar to its desktop and mobile counterparts and should be just as simple to navigate, apply settings and connect to a server. It should also connect quickly and remain connected throughout your streaming sessions.\nCost\nIf you\u2019re on a budget, cost will be an important consideration in choosing a VPN for your Fire TV Stick. VPN prices can vary from provider to provider, but you\u2019ll typically save more money in the long run when you commit to a longer timeframe. You can expect to pay anywhere from $30 to $150 per year for an annual VPN subscription, and anywhere from $5 to $15 for a monthly VPN subscription, depending on which VPN you go with.\nHow I tested VPNs on Fire TV Stick\nEach of CNET's top VPNs offers a native VPN app for the Fire TV Stick, but a few of them stood out during my tests. In addition to evaluating the usability and features of the Fire TV Stick VPN apps, I prioritized other important factors like security, speed and unblocking capabilities of each VPN I tested.\nFor my evaluation, I tested each VPN on a Fire TV Stick 4K Max. I opened each app on the Fire TV Stick and first tried to get a sense of its usability and available features. Is the app easy to navigate, and are the servers organized in a way that makes them easily accessible? Are the features useful, organized and simple to access?\nI then evaluated the overall performance of the app to see if the servers connected quickly, whether or not the connections were stable and how well the features performed. Finally, I tested how well each VPN performed in terms of unblocking geographically restricted content through various server locations and on various popular streaming services like Netflix, Disney Plus, HBO Max, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video. I tested to make sure the streaming services loaded up and started playing content quickly. I also noted whether the streaming experience was smooth and free of buffering, especially when streaming in 4K. The VPNs that consistently passed these tests earned a spot among my picks for the top Fire TV Stick VPNs.\nHow do I install a VPN on Amazon's Fire TV Stick?\nInstalling a VPN on the Fire TV Stick is easy. You can either navigate to the magnifying glass search icon on your Fire TV home screen and use your remote or Fire TV app on your smartphone to type in the name of the VPN you want to download, or you can use the Alexa function on your Fire TV remote and say the name of the VPN. Then, click on the logo of your selected VPN and click on Get to initiate the download. Click on Open to launch the app and log into your account. Once you've logged in, your VPN will ask for your permission to set up a VPN connection. Click on OK to allow the VPN to create the connection. Once you've given your VPN permission to connect, you can start using the VPN on your Fire TV Stick.\nWhich Amazon Fire TV device is best for streaming with a VPN?\nYou've got multiple Amazon Fire TV devices to pick from, and the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max is our choice as the best overall. In our testing, we liked its Wi-Fi 6 support, which helps when streaming high-bandwidth 4K video content on your favorite apps, like Amazon Prime Video, Netflix or Disney Plus. We also appreciated the Fire TV Stick 4K Max's capability to stream in the latest video standards, like Dolby Vision HDR.\nThe Amazon Fire TV Cube is great for home theater or smart home enthusiasts. We appreciate that it doubles as a smart speaker with Alexa onboard, so you can use voice search to look up movies and shows, adjust the volume, change TV inputs, stream music and more. There's even an HDMI input, so you can connect cable boxes, game consoles and other devices to your Fire TV Cube, which can be great if you're a home cinema buff with too many devices and not enough HDMI inputs on your TV.\nYou can install a VPN directly on your smart TV if you're using a television that runs Amazon Fire TV OS, like the Amazon Fire TV Omni or Panasonic Z95A OLED.\nCNET speed test data\nAny VPN will slow down your internet speeds (sometimes by as much as 50%), but a fast VPN should only drop your download speeds by an average of about 25% or less. We run over 250 individual speed tests per provider when we test VPNs. NordVPN was the fastest VPN we assessed in our latest round of testing, with a 3% average download speed loss. Surfshark, Proton VPN, Mullvad and ExpressVPN all registered speed loss of less than 25%. Because streaming video on an Amazon Fire TV stick requires fast internet speeds -- especially for 4K or 1080p content -- you'll want a reliable VPN that minimally cuts your download speed. Here's how our top VPN recommendations stacked up:\nSee which VPNs deliver the fastest -- or slowest -- internet speeds.\n| Provider | Speed loss |\n|---|---|\n| ExpressVPN | 18% |\n| Surfshark | 21% |\n| NordVPN | 3% |\n| Proton VPN | 16% |\n| Mullvad | 24% |\n| PIA | 48% |\nOther VPNs we tested on the Fire TV Stick\nIPVanish\n- Servers: 2,400-plus\n- Number of countries: 108\n- Country/jurisdiction: US\n- Platforms: Windows, MacOS, Linux (CLI), Chrome OS, Android, Android TV, iOS, iPadOS, Fire TV, Apple TV\n- Price: $13 per month, $40 for the first year (then $156 annually) or $52 for the first two years combined (then $312 every two years)\nI also tested IPVanish on the Fire TV Stick. Its app includes various settings and features to tool around with, but its high 44% average speed loss makes it unreliable for streaming video. The automatic app launch feature that allows users to select an app to launch automatically after a successful connection is a handy feature and worked well when set to auto-launch Netflix. But besides that, there wasn't much more to like about IPVanish's performance on the Fire TV Stick. Considering its unremarkable performance and ridiculously expensive renewal prices, I cannot enthusiastically recommend IPVanish as a viable VPN solution for the Fire TV Stick or for basically any other use case at this time. (Disclosure: IPVanish is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis).\nWe'll continue to test this and other VPNs on the Fire TV Stick, so be sure to check back often."

Our hands-on testing process involves running over 250 internet speed tests per provider, checking for DNS leaks, streaming content from popular providers such as Netflix and BBC iPlayer and poring over privacy policies.\nExpressVPN remains our pick as the best overall VPN by a razor-thin margin over NordVPN, thanks to its excellent privacy, transparency and usability. In July, ExpressVPN announced that its server network had been expanded to offer connection options in all 50 states. However, NordVPN once again emerged as the fastest VPN, posting a virtually unnoticeable 3% speed loss in our testing -- and with useful updates, including scam call protection on Android -- Nord continues to impress. Surfshark offers similar privacy features and functionality to ExpressVPN and NordVPN at a substantially lower cost, especially when it comes to renewal prices. Mullvad and Proton are worthy privacy-focused competitors, offering similar pricing to Surfshark. PIA's high speed loss and constant CAPTCHAs led us to remove it from our top recommendations and list it as another option to consider instead.\nWhat is the best VPN in 2025?\nExpressVPN is the best VPN overall thanks to its streamlined apps, fast server speeds, excellent streaming service unblocking and strong privacy. All told, ExpressVPN is an outstanding VPN for beginners and privacy experts alike. Its intuitive apps are a breeze to use, and we appreciate ExpressVPN\u2019s forward-thinking approach to privacy. You'll even find servers across all 50 of the United States, making it a great choice for travel within the US and unblocking regional sports such as NFL games. However, ExpressVPN charges a premium for its service at $13 per month, $100 for the first year (renewing at $100 a year) or $140 total for the first two years (renewing at $117 annually). While you do get some extra goodies bundled into your plan -- including a password manager and identity protection services -- we wish that ExpressVPN offered a cheaper basic package for people on a budget or who just want the VPN.\nNordVPN is an exceptional VPN that\u2019s extremely fast, great for streaming and packed with privacy features. Its connection speeds were the fastest we tested -- coupled with its extensive international server network and fantastic streaming service unblocking, Nord is one of the top VPNs for streaming. Plus, its massive global server footprint means NordVPN works well for travel. While NordVPN is initially a superb value at $13 per month, $60 for the first year or $81 total for the first two years, auto-renewal price hikes jack the cost up to an extortionate $140 annually on the one- and two-year plans. So we recommend monitoring your subscription to avoid a costly price increase. In July 2025, NordVPN released scam call protection on Android, making it an even more attractive mobile VPN.\nSurfshark is a great choice for folks seeking unique privacy features on a budget. It offers connection speeds and features comparable to ExpressVPN and NordVPN, but at an annual rate that's considerably cheaper at $48 for the first year or $60 total for the first two years (then $79 a year after the promotional period for both the one- and two-year plans). Surfshark gives you unlimited simultaneous connections, a benefit that most pricier competitors lack, including ExpressVPN and NordVPN. Despite its relative affordability in comparison with VPN rivals, Surfshark packs a privacy punch, offering unique features like split tunneling on MacOS and Dynamic MultiHop. Still, Surfshark doesn't quite match ExpressVPN's commitment to privacy, making it less suitable for people with critical privacy needs.\nMullvad VPN is the most private VPN. While you'll find the privacy basics, Mullvad goes above and beyond what most VPNs provide. Its unique privacy approach means you don't need to give the company any personal information if you don't want to -- not even an email address -- and you can even pay with cash. All of its apps are open-source, meaning anyone can inspect their source code for bugs or vulnerabilities. What's more, Mullvad's transparency extends to its pricing -- you'll pay 5 euros per month (about $6) whether you sign up for one month, one year or more with no price hikes at all. If you're seriously concerned about privacy, Mullvad is the VPN for you.\nProton VPN is the most versatile VPN on the market. It's privacy-forward, with neat features such as discreet app icons on Android to disguise your VPN app as a notes, weather or calculator app. An obfuscation-focused VPN protocol focuses on masking your VPN connection as standard web traffic to slip through firewalls. But Proton VPN works equally well for casual users seeking an excellent VPN for streaming -- it even unblocks tough-to-access regional content like Netflix Egypt. At $10 per month, $60 for the first year or $108 total for the first two years (the one- and two-year plans renew at $80 annually), Proton is a great value.\nEach VPN service we recommend has excellent value for a specific use case, and we point out the ideal customer for each one. The array of options available means there's a VPN service suited to your needs, whether your privacy needs are casual or critical. Also, consider jumping on one of the best VPN deals currently available, which many of our top picks are offering.\nVPN feature comparison: See how our top picks stack up\n| ExpressVPN | NordVPN | Surfshark | Proton VPN | Mullvad | |\n| Best | Overall | For power users | Value | Versatility | Privacy |\n| Price | $13 per month, $100 for the first year (renewing at $100 annually) or $140 total for the first two years (renewing at $117 per year) | $13 per month, $60 for a year or $81 for two years (one- and two-year plans auto-renew at $140 a year) | $15 per month, $48 the first year or $60 total for the first two years (one- and two-year plans renew at $79 per year) | $10 per month, $60 for a year or $108 for two years (one- and two-year plans auto-renew at $80 a year) | $6 |\n| Server network | 3,000-plus servers in 105 countries | 8,000-plus servers in 126 countries | 3,200-plus servers in 100 countries | 14,400-plus servers in 122 countries | 732 servers in 49 countries |\n| Free plan available | No | No | No | Yes | No |\n| Money-back guarantee | 30 days; 7-day free trial available in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store | 30 days | 30 days | 30 days | 14 days |\n| Average internet speed loss | 18% | 3% | 21% | 16% | 24% |\n| Simultaneous connections | 8 | 10 | Unlimited | 10 | 5 |\n| Jurisdiction | British Virgin Islands | Panama | Netherlands | Switzerland | Sweden |\n| Part of the 5, 9 or 14 Eyes data-sharing alliances? | No | No | Yes | No | Yes |\n| Kill switch | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Split tunneling | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Audited no-logs policy | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Double VPN/multi-hop | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Torrenting support | Yes (all servers) | Yes (dedicated P2P servers) | Yes (all servers) | Yes (dedicated P2P servers) | Yes (all servers) |\n| Streaming support | Netflix, Max, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer, CBC and more | Netflix, Max, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer, CBC and more | Netflix, Max, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer, CBC and more | Netflix, Max, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer, CBC and more | Netflix, Max |\n| Unblocks regional content reliably | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |\n| Supported platforms | Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, Android TV, iOS, iPadOS, Apple TV, Fire TV, Web browsers, Routers | Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, Android TV, iOS, iPadOS, Apple TV, Fire TV, Web browsers, Routers | Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, Android TV, iOS, iPadOS, Apple TV, Fire TV, Web browsers, Routers | Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, Android TV, iOS, iPadOS, Fire TV, Apple TV, Web browsers, Routers | Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, Android TV, iOS, iPadOS, Fire TV, Web browsers, Routers |\nFactors to consider in a VPN\nWhen shopping for a virtual private network, you'll need to figure out the best VPN for your needs and budget. Here's what to look for.\nInternet speed loss\nVPNs somewhat lower your internet speed because you're routing your traffic through an encrypted server before communicating with apps, websites and other internet services rather than a direct connection. The fastest VPNs feature an average download speed loss of 25% or less. Generally, even folks with slower connections -- like satellite internet -- won't notice a marginal 25% or under dip. For bandwidth-intensive applications like gaming, 4K video streaming or uploading large files, you'll want a VPN with minimal speed loss. Casual users with faster internet speeds should be fine with more than 25% speed loss, but we look for VPNs that keep speed loss below 50%.\nIn our 2025 testing, NordVPN came out on top with an impressively low 3% average internet speed loss. Mullvad, Surfshark, Proton VPN and ExpressVPN all clocked an average internet download speed loss of 25% or less.\nThis table shows the speeds we experienced in our testing. Your speeds will vary depending on factors like your internet service plan and connection type. The percentage of speed lost is intended as a general indicator of how much the VPN slows down your connection; lower numbers represent a faster overall connection.\n| Provider | Speed loss |\n|---|---|\n| NordVPN | 3% |\n| Proton VPN | 16% |\n| ExpressVPN | 18% |\n| Surfshark | 21% |\n| Mullvad | 24% |\nPrivacy\nVPNs bolster your privacy by masking your public IP address, which -- like your physical address -- contains identifying information about your geographical location. So when you connect to the internet while having a VPN enabled, your public IP address is hidden from your ISP, as well as apps you use and websites you visit. But the best VPNs provide robust privacy protections. At a minimum, we recommend a VPN with 256-bit encryption (for OpenVPN and IKEv2 VPN protocols) or ChaCha20 (with WireGuard), a strict no-logging policy and DNS leak protection. Because logging is tough to verify, look for regular third-party audits. You can and should be skeptical of your VPN provider's zero-log claims. Still, VPN audits are important even if they don't provide the full privacy picture.\nAdditionally, transparency reports offer peace of mind. We also suggest sticking with a VPN that includes a kill switch, which shuts your internet off in case your VPN unexpectedly disconnects. For granular control over your VPN connection, you may want split tunneling, which lets you use a VPN for some apps and websites but not others. For instance, you can use split tunneling to route your Netflix app through a VPN to unblock foreign content libraries while excluding your Google Chrome browser to avoid CAPTCHAs when logging into your email.\nMore privacy-concerned folks like investigative journalists or political activists will appreciate advanced features such as obfuscation (which makes it harder for ISPs to determine that you're using a VPN), Tor over VPN (for additional encryption using the Tor network) and a double VPN (which relies on a second VPN server connection to enhance encryption). Folks with critical privacy needs should consider a VPN provider with jurisdiction outside of the Five, Nine or Fourteen Eyes intelligence-sharing communities for even stronger peace of mind. Whether you're just curious or you suspect your VPN isn't working, you may want to perform a VPN test.\nServer network\nWhen considering VPN server networks, look at the overall number of servers, as well as the individual country locations. For instance, one virtual private network company may have twice the total number of servers as a competitor but half the different country locations, meaning you've got fewer international choices. At the high end, the best VPNs for travel offer 90-plus individual countries, but anywhere over 60 countries will work for many folks.\nOutside of country locations, some VPNs allow file sharing across all servers, whereas others feature dedicated P2P (peer-to-peer) options. For purposes like torrenting, check whether your desired provider permits file sharing on all servers or select ones.\nAdditionally, you'll sometimes find specialty servers, like Tor (The Onion Router) over VPN, Double VPN or obfuscated servers. Onion over VPN and Double VPN servers provide extra privacy by bolstering your encryption even further when compared with a standard VPN connection, with Tor using the Onion network while a double VPN relies on a second VPN tunnel. On the other hand, obfuscated servers make it more difficult for apps, websites or internet service providers to determine that you're using a VPN.\nDevice support\nThink about your devices and what you'd like to run a VPN on so that you can check for an available virtual private network app. Most virtual private network services offer apps for Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android/Android TV, iOS/iPadOS and web browsers. Apple TV apps are increasingly common, with ExpressVPN, Surfshark, Proton VPN, PIA, NordVPN, PrivadoVPN and IPVanish featuring TVOS applications.\nA graphical user interface application may be easier for Linux users than a command-line interface option. ExpressVPN, NordVPN, Surfshark, Proton and PIA boast Linux GUI apps, making them compelling choices for Linux VPNs. Windows for Arm support is available with some VPNs, including NordVPN, Surfshark, Proton VPN, ExpressVPN and PIA. You can typically install a VPN on your router for whole-home coverage and use it on devices that don't support native VPN apps, like Xbox consoles, although this will typically void the warranty on the router.\nMost VPN companies let you install an app on as many gadgets as you wish, but you're sometimes limited to simultaneous devices. ExpressVPN allows eight, while NordVPN and Proton give you 10. Surfshark, PIA and IPVanish are unlimited. Even with a provider like Express, Proton or Nord, you can still install a VPN on as many devices as you wish, but you'll be able to have only a handful of active sessions at once. Most folks should be fine even with eight to 10 simultaneous connections, but families or hardcore power users may feel constrained. If you've got a lot of gadgets you want to install a VPN on, you may want to consider one of the best VPNs for multiple devices, including Surfshark, NordVPN, PIA and ExpressVPN.\nVPN device compatibility\nWondering which VPN services work on which devices? We've got you covered.\n| ExpressVPN | NordVPN | Surfshark | ProtonVPN | Mullvad | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Windows (x86 and Arm) | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f |\n| MacOS | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f |\n| Linux | \u2714\ufe0f (with GUI) | \u2714\ufe0f (with GUI) | \u2714\ufe0f (with GUI) | \u2714\ufe0f (with GUI) | \u2714\ufe0f (with GUI) |\n| Android/AndroidTV | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f |\n| iOS/iPadOS | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f |\n| Fire TV | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f |\n| Smart TV* | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f |\n| Apple TV | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f |\n| Router | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f |\n| Browser plugin** | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f |\n| Simultaneous connections | 8 | 10 | Unlimited | 10 | 5 |\nStreaming capabilities\nVPNs can be great for privacy. They're also helpful for unblocking region-restricted entertainment content. A VPN lets you stream services like Peacock (for NFL games), Max or Hulu from your home country while traveling abroad. Conversely, VPNs also unlock access to foreign libraries on platforms like Netflix (to watch Squid Game), Disney Plus (for Marvel's What If viewings) and Amazon Prime Video (currently featuring Cross). You may even be able to save money by using a VPN for streaming. For more info, check out the best VPNs for Amazon Prime Video and the best VPNs for streaming.\nCost\nWith most VPNs, you can buy virtual private network service on a monthly, bi-annual, annual or multi-year plan. Although multi-year deals typically net you the most savings, we usually recommend sticking with an annual plan for the best savings with the lowest risk. The virtual private network you sign up for may initially be fast, private and great for geo-unblocking, but may become slower, suffer a data breach or stop allowing access to foreign Netflix libraries over a year.\nOn the high end, VPNs such as Express cost around $100 per year, with value-packed providers like Surfshark and PIA offering introductory year-long prices from $40 to $48. Some companies include price hikes: NordVPN normally charges $60 annually for your first year, then your plan renews at $140 per 12 months. Similarly, Surfshark goes for $48 a year upfront, then renews at $79 annually. Make a budget, then find a VPN provider that fits the bill while being mindful of price hikes. Notably, there are plenty of ways to save money on your VPN subscription, like avoiding raised renewal rates by taking advantage of seasonal discounts like Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals. If you're on a budget, you may want to consider one of the best cheap VPNs, like Surfshark, PIA or Mullvad.\nAdditional VPN factors to consider when selecting the best VPN for your needs and budget\nDon't use free VPN providers: Except for Proton -- the best free VPN on the market -- you'll find only paid VPN options on this list because they're the only ones we recommend.\nLook for a no-logs VPN but understand the caveats: The best VPNs keep as few logs as possible and make them as anonymous as possible, so there's little data to provide should authorities come knocking. Even \"no-logs\" VPNs aren't 100% anonymous.\nThere are limits to the privacy VPNs currently provide to iOS users: Recent independent research has surfaced suggesting iPhones and iPads running iOS 14 or later may be vulnerable to device-only VPN leaks, regardless of which VPN is used. Apple users concerned with potential leaks can take extra precautions by installing their VPN on a home router to ensure their entire Wi-Fi network is encrypted. Some iOS users may potentially reduce the likelihood of leaks while outside of a home network by enabling their VPN's kill switch and selecting OpenVPN protocols. You can also try closing all apps, activating your VPN and then enabling and disabling Airplane Mode before using your device normally. Apple advises users to activate their device's Always On VPN profile for additional protection.\nVPN transparency is important, but warrant canaries are only the beginning: Many services use \"warrant canaries\" to passively note to the public whether or not they've been subpoenaed by a government entity. This is because many investigations from national security agencies can't be actively disclosed by law. Like the no-logging issue, warrant canaries aren't always as straightforward as they seem. You should spend more time investigating whether your prospective VPN has cooperated with authorities in the past, and how and when it's disclosed that fact.\nThink twice about using a US-based VPN: The Patriot Act is still the law of the land in the US, and that means US-based VPNs have little recourse if and when the feds show up with subpoenas or national security letters in hand demanding access to servers, VPN user accounts or other data. Yes, they may have little data to access if the service has a strong no-logs policy, but why not just choose a service that's based outside Uncle Sam's jurisdiction? (If this is a concern for you, you'll also want to avoid countries with which the US has intelligence-sharing agreements.)\nVPN speed test data\nAlthough VPN speeds aren't the only important criteria, you'll need a virtual private network provider with fast speeds. If all servers severely hinder your internet speeds, then streaming, browsing the web or hopping on Zoom calls may be be frustrating. Here's how VPN provider speeds stacked up.\nAbout VPNs\nA virtual private network, or VPN, improves your privacy by hiding your public IP address, which is similar to your home address but on the internet. With a VPN enabled, your internet service provider or mobile carrier can't tell what apps you use or websites you visit, so you can mask your internet browsing or app activity and torrent privately. Because VPNs encrypt your web traffic by routing it through secure servers, you can make it appear as though you're connecting from a different city, state or country, which lets you stream foreign content libraries from streaming services like Netflix or BBC iPlayer. VPNs are also handy for travel because you can access services like email from your home country while abroad for a summer vacation without dealing with annoying CAPTCHAs. Because of their diverse applications, VPNs are excellent additions to your app arsenal.\nSince VPNs can bypass regional content blocks, they're useful in various scenarios, including streaming service unblocking, international travel, circumventing throttling and avoiding censorship. Whether you want to stream Happy Gilmore 2 on Netflix, get around video traffic shaping on mobile devices or avoid CAPTCHAs when logging into your email while traveling abroad for a summer vacation, a VPN is a nifty app to have installed on your devices.\nThe best VPNs provide strong privacy protections without compromising on performance, notably internet speeds. At CNET, we rigorously test each VPN across all major platforms to determine the ones that provide exceptional privacy, reliability, speed, streaming service unblocking and value. We actively test VPNs and review the latest research, so expect this guide to change as we put each VPN through its paces. We've recently retested ExpressVPN, NordVPN, Surfshark, Proton VPN, Private Internet Access and Mullvad from the ground up and are in the process of retesting IPVanish, CyberGhost and PrivadoVPN.\nHow we test VPNs\nOur hands-on testing and review process is designed to cut through the hype and determine the best VPNs of the bunch. When we look at each VPN service, we're not just examining them for their technical weaknesses, but we're also scrutinizing their individual performance strengths in various areas, like privacy, streaming or value for the money. We want to know what each service does best. We test each VPN across over 20 factors, and we continually improve our methodology as we learn more. Our rigorous testing process involves running over 250 internet speed tests across multiple worldwide servers to determine accurate internet speed loss averages.\nWe test VPNs for browsing and streaming speed in multiple countries, as well as their connection stability and even the smallest potential privacy leaks. By testing across multiple devices and platforms, we're able to assess which VPNs are best for gaming versus those best for streaming, torrenting or sharing sensitive information. Most importantly, we focus on doing the deep-dive research necessary to vet each VPN's historical credibility and its ownership in a notoriously murky market.\nThe VPNs on this list earn our recommendation for more than just boosting their digital privacy strengths -- they enable easy streaming to overcome geo-blocked media, have torrenting-friendly servers and are fast enough to support gaming globally. Based on those continued evaluations, you'll see a few bullet points on each entry in our list, highlighting each VPN's strengths and the uses we recommend it for most. Because we strive to keep on top of a fast-changing market, you'll notice that the rank of each VPN service changes as we learn more and retest.\nHow to choose the right VPN for you\nPicking the best VPN requires knowing two basic things to start with: What you want to use it for, and what you're willing to pay. The range of VPN offerings is vast, but those two things will help you find a VPN that has the right blend of speed, security and cost.\nBelow, you'll find specific FAQ sections on picking a VPN based on the most common needs: gaming, streaming media, working from home and privacy-critical professions. In general, you'll want a VPN that provides sufficient encryption, doesn't log your activity, offers essential security features like DNS leak protection and a kill switch, has server locations where you need them and can give you fast connection speeds. Our top five VPNs have all these features, although connection speeds will vary based on your internet provider and the server you connect to.\nFor a deeper dive, check our detailed walk-through of how we evaluate and review VPNs. If you're looking for some quick pointers, here are universally applicable advice guides for beginners:\nWhat to look forward to in 2025\nThe biggest change we're seeing is that VPN companies have started going beyond just offering VPNs, and are striving to be one-stop cybersecurity shops by including services like password managers, antivirus software and identity theft protection in bundles. Many of our top VPN picks now let you bundle antivirus software, password managers and identity theft protection services. There are pros and cons to bundling. On the one hand, it may be more convenient to have one bill rather than several to keep track of, and it might also be more cost-effective. However, on the other hand, you might end up paying for services you don't use, and it may be cumbersome to transfer out of that ecosystem in the event of a data breach or price increase.\nAll of our top-rated VPNs now offer user-friendly Linux graphical user interface apps, which is refreshing since it makes using a VPN on Linux more accessible, particularly for beginners. With an increased concern about threats from quantum computing, like hacking, providers are adding post-quantum resistance to VPN apps. In 2025, NordVPN added post-quantum protection to all of its apps, joining ExpressVPN and Mullvad in providing quantum-resistant encryption. In July 2025, ExpressVPN announced that it had servers in all 50 states, making it a great choice for traveling to and within the US, as well as unblocking regional sports streaming matches, like NFL or NWSL games. Also in July 2025, NordVPN rolled out scam call protection on Android. We expect that server rosters will continue to grow throughout 2025, and that VPN providers will keep offering additional cybersecurity features in addition to VPNs, whether as part of base VPN plans or as bundles.\nOther VPNs we've tested\nNot every VPN can be a favorite. These are the ones we reviewed, but they're not full-throated recommendations for one reason or another, including limited features and concerns over adequately hiding your identity, ultimately falling short to other picks we selected as the best VPNs. In addition to the more recently tested VPNs below, we also looked at Hotspot Shield and TunnelBear a few years ago and were left disappointed at the time.\nPrivate Internet Access is a budget-friendly VPN that undercuts most of the competition at $12 per month, $40 for the first year (renewing at $50 annually) or $79 total for three years. It\u2019s privacy-forward with open-source apps, meaning anyone can inspect the source code for vulnerabilities or bugs, and one of the most reader-friendly privacy policies we\u2019ve encountered. PIA was largely good for streaming service unblocking, letting us watch Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus, BBC iPlayer, Max and a slew of other sites. It\u2019s suitable for international and US domestic travel -- you\u2019ll get 35,000 servers in 91 countries, including servers in all 50 of the United States. PIA is a compelling choice if you want to stream regional US sports, like NFL games.\nWhile PIA largely sticks to the privacy basics, its highly customizable VPN apps should satisfy power users who want lots of control over VPN connections. Apple users will appreciate split tunneling on MacOS -- a rarity among VPN providers that few providers besides PIA and Surfshark include.\nHowever, PIA\u2019s sluggish server speeds make it unsuitable for folks with slower or more unreliable internet connections. We clocked an underwhelming 49% average internet speed loss in our 2025 speed testing. That might be fine if you\u2019re using Google Fiber or cable, like Spectrum, but satellite internet users should opt for a faster VPN. Moreover, we encountered a lot of CAPTCHAs using PIA, even when trying to perform a basic Google search. For a little more money, you can get a lot more value with faster speeds and more advanced privacy features by opting for a VPN like Surfshark or Proton.\n- Servers: 35,000-plus\n- Number of countries: 91\n- Country/jurisdiction: US\n- Platforms: Windows, MacOS, Linux (GUI), Android, Android TV, iOS, iPadOS, Fire TV, Apple TV, browsers, routers\n- Price: $12 per month, $40 for the first year (then $50 annually) or $79 total for three years\nIPVanish is a decent beginner-friendly VPN for folks seeking basic privacy. It does a good job of unblocking geographically protected streaming content on multiple services, such as providing access to foreign Netflix libraries (IPVanish is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis). We liked its intuitive VPN apps which, while easy to use even for novices, weren't quite as streamlined as apps from NordVPN or ExpressVPN. While you get privacy fundamentals from IPVanish, its US jurisdiction makes it unsuitable for people with critical privacy needs, like political activists, investigative journalists or asylum-seekers.\nIts comparatively slow speeds -- we measured a 44% average internet speed loss -- severely lagged behind NordVPN (11%), Surfshark (17%), Proton VPN (21%) and ExpressVPN (25%). But its servers peppering 108 countries mean you get an international reach close to NordVPN (126 countries), ExpressVPN (105) countries, Surfshark (100 countries), Proton (122 countries) and PIA (91 countries). IPVanish sets you back $13 per month, $40 for your first year or $53 for two years combined -- but the one- and two-year plans jump to $156 annually (the two-year tier renews at $312 total for two years of service, which breaks down to $156 a year paid upfront) after your introductory pricing period. For the price, you can get a VPN with faster internet speed maintenance.\n- Servers: 2,400-plus\n- Number of countries: 108\n- Country/jurisdiction: US\n- Platforms: Windows, MacOS, Linux (CLI), Chrome OS, Android, Android TV, iOS, iPadOS, Fire TV, Apple TV\n- Price: $13 per month, $40 for the first year (then $156 annually) or $52 for the first two years combined (then $312 total for two years of service)\nIf you need a VPN with a massive number of servers in tons of different locations, or if you\u2019re a streaming enthusiast who likes to stream a wide variety of streaming content, then CyberGhost is a serviceable choice for casual use cases. If you\u2019re a journalist, activist, dissident, physician, attorney or anyone else with critical privacy needs looking for a solid privacy-focused VPN, you won\u2019t find it in CyberGhost.\nWe like that CyberGhost publishes extremely detailed quarterly transparency reports (far outdoing all other VPNs in terms of detail and frequency) and operates a RAM-only server infrastructure, but the company\u2019s overall approach to user privacy needs some major attention. CyberGhost\u2019s privacy policy outlines some questionable data-sharing practices, and we were perplexed by how the VPN\u2019s website and onboarding process reinforces the dangerous falsehood that VPNs can make you totally anonymous online. We were also disappointed to see how CyberGhost attempts to trick users into agreeing to share additional data with the company through its apps.\nBesides CyberGhost\u2019s dubious approach to user privacy, the VPN\u2019s apps are a mess. Throughout our testing process, we ran into numerous bugs and choppy performance on nearly all of CyberGhost\u2019s apps across the platforms we tested. In our testing, all of CyberGhost\u2019s apps consistently took an abnormally long time to connect to a server. At times, the apps would become entirely unresponsive, requiring an app restart and sometimes even a full system restart. CyberGhost\u2019s apps also don\u2019t offer much in the way of helpful bonus features like many others, including Surfshark and NordVPN, do. If you need a fast VPN, you\u2019ll probably be disappointed by CyberGhost\u2019s mediocre speed performance (30% speed lost in CNET\u2019s testing).\nOverall, CyberGhost is a sub-par VPN provider with buggy apps, middling speed performance and questionable privacy practices. It costs $13 per month, $42 every six months or $57 for the first 24 months (then $57 annually). For a similar price or even cheaper, you can choose several VPNs that are far superior to CyberGhost.\n- Number of servers: 11,500-plus\n- Number of countries: 100-plus\n- Jurisdiction: Romania, with UK parent company\n- Platforms: Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, iPadOS, Android, Android TV, Fire TV\n- $13 per month, $42 every six months, $57 for the first two years (then $57 annually)\nNorton LifeLock, long known for excellence in security products, has a relatively limited offering in its VPN product. Norton Secure VPN does not support P2P or BitTorrent, Linux, routers or set-top boxes. It's Netflix and streaming compatibility is somewhat limited. Even worse, during testing, we experienced privacy-compromising data leaks.\nDuring CNET's testing, Norton Secure VPN speeds were comparable to other mid-tier VPNs but not particularly competitive. Although its VPN is only available on four platforms -- Mac, iOS, Windows and Android -- Norton gets points for its 24/7 live customer service phone support and 60-day money-back guarantee.\nNorton Secure VPN costs $40 for the first year, rising to $80 upon renewal. For that price, you get protection for five devices, which is well below ExpressVPN's eight simultaneous devices, Nord and Proton's 10 or Surshark and PIA's unlimited. Most VPN providers let you install a VPN on as many devices as you like but limit your simultaneous usage, Norton restricts how many total devices you can download a VPN on. This stingy device allowance is well under the competition. If you need more, you can always upgrade to Norton's Ultra VPN Plus with its 10-device policy. Norton Secure VPN Plus and Ultra VPN Plus bundle antivirus software, so if you need a VPN with antivirus, it's a consideration.\n- Number of servers: 2,000-plus\n- Number of countries: 60-plus\n- Country/jurisdiction: US\n- Platforms: Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS, iPadOS\n- Price: $40 for the first year for 5 devices (renews at $80), $50 for the first year with Norton antivirus for 5 devices (renews at $110) or $60 for the first year for 10 devices including antivirus (renews at $130)\nPrivadoVPN is a decent no-frills VPN provider. Its free plan limits your monthly usage to 10GB, but you can pick from servers in 13 cities. By contrast, Proton VPN doesn't limit your data consumption, but you can't choose a server manually. You won't get the fastest internet download and upload speeds or the largest server network with its paid tiers, but Privado is a solid VPN for streaming.\nPrivado has privacy-friendly Swiss jurisdiction, but it hasn't been audited. All of its privacy features work, including split tunneling, DNS leak protection and a kill switch, although its kill switch was almost too aggressive, keeping your internet cut off even after manually disconnecting from a server or closing the PrivadoVPN app. Because of its lack of audits, it's hard to recommend Privado for privacy-conscious users, like investigative journalists, political activists, asylum-seekers or even worried torrenters. Privado is one of the best VPNs for casual users, with a premium plan available as a convenient upgrade path.\n- Number of servers: Hundreds\n- Number of countries: 50\n- Country/jurisdiction: Switzerland\n- Platforms: Windows, MacOS, Android, Android TV, iOS, iPadOS, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Linux, routers\n- Price: Free, $8 per month, $20 for the first year (then $60 annually) or $30 total for the first two years (then $96 total for two years)\nBest VPN FAQs\nIn today's hyper-connected world, online privacy and security are increasingly critical. From online banking to communicating remotely with colleagues, we're transferring more data on our computers and smartphones than ever before. Much of that data is confidential information that we need to keep safe from hackers and snoops, so VPN use is on the rise as people take steps to secure their digital lives."

Its fast speeds and generous worldwide server network make it a great choice for travel, domestically and internationally, as well as streaming.\nProton is the best free VPN on the market, offering access to servers in five countries. Additionally, its paid premium plan boasts an exhaustive network of 13,700-plus servers in 122 countries.\nExpressVPN is an excellent all-around VPN for travel, with more than 3,000 servers in 105 countries. With servers in all 50 of the United States, ExpressVPN is an exceptional choice for traveling to and within the US. Some competitors include more simultaneous connections and a slightly larger international server network but ExpressVPN's apps are intuitive for VPN newcomers and privacy power users alike.\nSurfshark is the best value VPN for travel, with a terrific feature set that doesn't break the bank or cut privacy corners, alongside a solid web of 3,200 servers in 100 countries.\nAbout VPNs for travel\nA virtual private network masks your public IP address, which provides information about your physical location. VPNs fulfill various needs, including bolstering privacy, unblocking geographically protected content like foreign Netflix libraries and circumventing bandwidth throttling. That suite of features makes VPNs particularly useful when traveling. Whether you want to stream region-restricted movies and shows while traveling, log into your online banking app from abroad without triggering a CAPTCHA or add an extra layer of protection on public Wi-Fi (such as at the airport terminal and your hotel), a VPN is essential for travel. The benefits of VPNs make them great to install before you embark on your journey.\nHere at CNET, we\u2019ve thoroughly assessed dozens of VPNs, running speed tests, checking for DNS leaks, streaming videos and comparing prices to analyze value. When rounding up the top travel VPNs, we primarily focused on each provider\u2019s server locations by number of countries and total options. We also considered privacy features, device compatibility and general performance. Whether you're on a summer vacation, galivanting across the globe on business or on a cross-country road trip, a virtual private network is a great addition to your app arsenal. Let\u2019s dive into the best VPNs for travel to keep you connected wherever you roam.\nFactors to consider in a VPN for travel\nThere\u2019s a lot to think about when selecting a VPN for travel. Leveraging our years of expertise in the VPN space coupled with what you\u2019ll need when traveling, here\u2019s what to look for:\nServer network\nSpecifically for travel, you\u2019ll want a large VPN server network. More overall connectivity options are beneficial, you\u2019ll also want plenty of countries if you plan on any international travel. Therefore, it's important to consider the total number of servers as well as the individual country count. For instance, some VPNs have thousands of servers sprinkled through only a few nations. At the high end, you'll find VPNs with servers in 100 or more countries, although I'd recommend picking a VPN with a presence in at least 50 international locations. Many servers in a smaller handful of countries might work if you only travel to one of those spots. For regular international adventures, greater country choice comes in handy.\nPrivacy\nVPNs add a layer of protection by encrypting your traffic and masking your IP address, making it harder for cyber attackers to access your browsing data. When traveling, you\u2019ll likely use open wireless networks at an airport terminal, in the hotel lobby or at a coffee shop, but a VPN protects your data from eavesdropping, whether by cyber criminals or snooping ISPs. Look for a strict no-logging policy, and AES 256-bit encryption (OpenVPN and IKEv2) or ChaCha20 (WireGuard or IKEv2) at a minimum.\nDevice compatibility\nYou\u2019ll want a VPN that runs on the gadgets you\u2019re bringing on your trip. Make a list of the devices you want to bring along with a VPN installed and ensure your provider has apps for those electronics. Luckily, most providers offer solid Windows, MacOS, Android and iPhone apps. Many offer Linux VPN apps, but only a few feature a graphical user interface, which is more beginner-friendly than a command-line interface. If you want to tote your Linux laptop or a Steam Deck along, look for a VPN with a Linux GUI app. Although most folks don\u2019t travel with streaming devices, you might tote along a Fire Stick, Android TV box or Apple TV for your hotel room.\nSpeed\nAll VPNs throttle your internet upload and download speeds somewhat, but the fastest options drop your connectivity by an average loss of only 10% to 25%. Especially if you\u2019re performing internet-intensive tasks like streaming video in 4K, Zooming for work, gaming or uploading YouTube videos, you\u2019ll want a fast VPN. Even if you aren\u2019t, reliable internet speeds are great for a better experience checking your email and browsing the web.\nStreaming support\nAside from privacy, many people use VPNs to unblock region-restricted content. For instance, you can use a VPN to watch BBC iPlayer -- normally available only in the UK -- from other countries, like the US, meaning you can stream shows like The Jetty. Similarly, a VPN is useful when traveling. If you\u2019re on vacation in a foreign country but want to access Netflix libraries from your home country to continue your binge-watching, a VPN makes that possible. Check which VPNs unblock the streaming services you want to watch from abroad.\nPrice\nVPNs range from about $13 a month to about $100 annually. Generally, you\u2019ll get a discount by paying for a year or more of service upfront, but we don\u2019t recommend shelling out for more than 12 months at a time. While the VPN you pick might initially be fast, secure and excellent for streaming, it could get acquired by a shady company, suffer a data breach or get slower during a year. We suggest sticking to an annual plan for the best value and the least risk.\nWhy you should use a VPN for travel\nA VPN makes a great travel companion thanks to its privacy features and geographic unblocking. Because a VPN encrypts your internet traffic, it protects your data to a degree from others on a public Wi-Fi network seeking unencrypted data. Websites you visit don\u2019t see your actual IP address and instead view an IP given to you by your VPN software, making it harder to view personal information such as your physical location or online activity. You\u2019re still susceptible to malware, viruses and phishing attacks, so keep in mind that a VPN isn\u2019t an antivirus software replacement. You can find antivirus software bundled with some VPNs and vice versa.\nVPNs can also spoof apps and internet-connected services like websites into thinking you\u2019re located in a different region. For example, you might be on holiday in the UK but want to access your Gmail without triggering a security login. Or perhaps you\u2019d like to stream a movie that is only available on US Netflix while in Canada. Using a VPN, you can make it appear like you\u2019re in a different city or even country. Whether for entertainment purposes or bypassing CAPTCHAs, VPNs can circumvent location restrictions.\nFor more geographically specific VPN information, check out our guides to the best VPNs for Canada, Mexico, Australia and Japan.\nHow we test VPNs for travel\nI couldn\u2019t use this article as an excuse to travel extensively but I have country-hopped regularly, with notable stints in the UK, Peru and Sierra Leone. On a trip to Rome in 2019, I downloaded a VPN on my laptop and Android phone before leaving so I could stream Netflix from the hotel and access my Gmail without triggering a security alert (at the time, I was using VPN Unlimited, although I\u2019ve since switched to NordVPN). To select the best VPNs for travel, we rigorously assessed dozens of providers by running speed tests, checking for DNS leaks, poring over terms of service, using apps and streaming videos. We researched VPN provider server networks, factoring in the overall number and country locations, which dictate whether a virtual private network is suitable for globe-trotting.\nOther VPNs we tested\nPIA\nPrivate Internet Access brings a lot to the table, particularly for regular travelers. Its large server network blankets the globe with 35,000 servers in 91 countries. ExpressVPN and Surfshark deliver more individual country choices but PIA\u2019s sheer number of servers lets you easily find an optimal connection. It\u2019s an especially great VPN for folks traveling domestically or to one of the worldwide locales where Private Internet Access maintains a decent presence. In our experience, we found PIA unblocked Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus and Netflix on US and UK servers, making it a good VPN for streaming.\nIts wallet-friendly pricing sets you back just $12 monthly, $40 for the first year ($50 annually upon renewal) or $79 total for three years. By comparison, most VPNs like NordVPN and ExpressVPN typically charge $60 to $100 a year. The value-packed Surfshark charges about $48 for your first year and its price jumps to $60 after its initial sweet introductory pricing.\nDespite its relatively low cost, PIA doesn\u2019t cut corners. Although it\u2019s not the most feature-rich VPN, you\u2019ll get a solid privacy suite, including a kill switch that stops your internet if your VPN gets disconnected, split tunneling for using a VPN for some apps but not others and 256-bit encryption over OpenVPN or IKEv2 with ChaCha20 on WireGuard. There\u2019s multihop, which routes your connection through another server for additional privacy, and obfuscated servers, making it tougher for apps or ISPs to identify when you\u2019re using a VPN. PIA also boasts unlimited simultaneous connections -- the pricier ExpressVPN limits you to eight.\nUnfortunately, PIA delivered middling internet speeds in our testing with an average speed loss of 49%. All VPNs slow down your connection somewhat, with the fastest VPNs offering an average internet speed loss of 25% or less. Folks with faster internet connections like fiber shouldn\u2019t notice a difference even with a higher speed loss but PIA isn\u2019t ideal for people with slower speeds like satellite internet users. With its decent features, pricing transparency and subscriptions that significantly undercut the competition, PIA remains a solid VPN that boasts a generous server network, unlimited simultaneous connections and relative affordability compared to VPN rivals. But for the price, you're better off with Surfshark, which is faster and offers a larger global server network.\nIPVanish\nIPVanish offers 2,400-plus servers in 108 countries, which is in the same ballpark as NordVPN, Proton VPN, ExpressVPN and Surfshark. (Disclosure: IPVanish is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.) In our experience, IPVanish's internet download speeds were uneven, with a 44% average internet download speed loss in our 2024 testing, with fast speeds marred by occasionally noticeable dips, which could impact gaming or 4K streaming.\nIPVanish provides plenty of perks, including unlimited simultaneous connections, user-friendly apps and great streaming capabilities. It streams and unblocks region-restricted content from Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus, Hulu and Netflix with aplomb. At $13 monthly, $40 for the first year or $53 total for two years, IPVanish initially saves you money upfront compared to competitors like ExpressVPN or NordVPN. However, its exorbitantly expensive renewal prices of $156 a year for the annual plan and $312 for the two-year plan trounce even pricey autorenewals of ExpressVPN ($117 autorenewal) and NordVPN ($140 renewal). IPVanish works fine for casual use but you can get a VPN with more robust privacy features and faster internet speeds, all of which benefit travel. IPVanish\u2019s user-friendly apps make it a decent choice for beginners seeking a VPN to add peace of mind and allow for streaming abroad. But wallet-friendly VPNs PIA and Surfshark are better options for the money because of their larger server networks.\nCyberGhost\nWith 11,500-plus servers spanning 100 countries, CyberGhost offers loads of choices for international travel. It\u2019s decent for streaming from BBC iPlayer, Netflix and other sites. You can use specific servers optimized for streaming, but streaming works on all servers. CyberGhost remains wallet-friendly at $13 per month, $42 every six months or $57 total for the first two years of service (you\u2019re billed annually after 24 months of service on its two-year plan).\nCyberGhost lacks advanced privacy features like Tor Over VPN or double-hop servers, both of which make it even more difficult to trace your traffic back to its source. There is obfuscation, which makes it more difficult to determine that you\u2019re using a VPN, which can circumvent restrictions by countries, ISPs or Wi-Fi networks that have blocked VPNs. Obfuscated servers could be useful when running a VPN at school, work or in a country where virtual private networks are frowned upon.\nCyberGhost's high internet speed loss isn\u2019t ideal for demanding applications like 4K streaming or gaming. CyberGhost does provide some useful features, including a kill switch, which shuts off your internet if your VPN gets disconnected, and split tunneling for selectively choosing some apps but not all to route through your VPN. All things considered, CyberGhost is acceptable for casual use like streaming videos or web browsing, and its exhaustive server network is particularly well-suited to travel. Uneven speed loss and middle-of-the-road privacy features mean you\u2019ve likely got better choices.\nWhat to look forward to in 2025\nOut top-rated VPNs -- ExpressVPN, NordVPN, Surfshark, Proton VPN and Mullvad -- all now offer Linux GUI apps, which are easier to use for beginners than command-line-only apps. So if you're a Linux user and want to bring your Linux laptop along while traveling, you can install an intuitive graphical user interface VPN app. In July 2025, ExpressVPN announced that it had server locations in all 50 US states, making is great for travel to and within the United States, as well as solid for streaming regional sports content, such as NFL, WNBA or NWSL games.\nAlongside traditional VPN protocols, like WireGuard (or its equivalents) and OpenVPN, some VPN providers now provide obfuscation-focused VPN protocols, such as NordVPN's NordWhisper and Proton VPN's Stealth, which try to mask the fact that you're using a VPN. If you need to have a VPN running in a situation where VPNs are frowned upon -- such as in certain countries or on school Wi-Fi, for instance -- an obfuscation-centric VPN protocol could come in handy."

      "text": "Our picks\n90001 Edit ZIP codeBROADBAND DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $35 (save $20)\nSearching for an internet provider is often a painstaking, teeth-grinding process. I've been working the broadband beat for over six years and know the task can be daunting if you don't know where to start. But we've done the work for you by gathering our top broadband picks based on pricing, speeds, service terms and internet connection types. Here's everything you need to know to find the best internet provider for your home.\nWhat's the best internet provider overall?\nVerizon Fios and AT&T Fiber are two providers that stand out as the best internet service providers overall.Those in the Northeast will have a tough time finding a better ISP than Verizon Fios, while many in the South and Midwest will find AT&T Fiber the best option. As we often say in our ISP reviews, fiber internet almost always trumps other internet connection types. Don't hesitate to sign up if you can get fiber broadband at your address for a reasonable price.\nThere are times when cable internet, like that of Xfinity, Spectrum and Cox, is the best option. Cable is often a solid choice for cheap internet, which could be important because a recent CNET survey showed that 63% of adults paid more for internet service last year than they did the year prior. Cable can also be a fine option if you're interested in bundling internet and TV, or internet and mobile. Cable internet boasts the highest availability of any non-satellite connection type, often making it the best option if there are no fiber providers in your area. Let's look at which internet providers made CNET's cut.\nOur methodology\nCNET considers speeds, pricing, customer service and overall value to recommend the best internet service providers across several categories. Our evaluation includes referencing a proprietary database built over years of reviewing internet services. We validate that against provider information by spot-checking local addresses for service availability. We also closely read providers' terms and conditions and, when needed, call ISPs to verify the details.\nDespite our efforts to find the most recent and accurate information, our process has some limitations you should know about. Pricing and speed data are variable: Certain addresses may qualify for different service tiers, and monthly costs may vary, even within a city. The best way to identify your options is to plug your address into a provider's website.\nAlso, the prices, speed and other information listed above and in the provider cards below may differ from what we found in our research. The cards display the full range of a provider's pricing and speed across the US, according to our database of plan information provided directly by ISPs. At the same time, the plan charts display the offerings most common to most areas. The prices referenced within this article's text come from our research and include applicable discounts for setting up automatic payments each month -- a standard industry offering. Discounts and promotions might also be available for signing a term contract or bundling multiple services.\nTo learn more about how we review internet providers, visit our full methodology page.\nLocating local internet providers\nBest internet providers in the US\nAT&T Fiber\nBest fiber internet provider\nOur take - It's not the cheapest internet provider, but in terms of overall value, AT&T Fiber is one of the best. Considering cost-per-Mbps, which is a way of comparing apples to apples, AT&T Fiber is one of the top values out there. Free equipment rental, unlimited data and no set price increases add to the provider's overall appeal.\nAT&T Fiber plans and prices\n| Plan | Starting monthly price | Max speeds | Monthly equipment fee | Data cap | Contract |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| AT&T Fiber 300 Read full review | $55 | 300Mbps download and upload | None | None | None |\n| AT&T Fiber 500 Read full review | $65 | 500Mbps download and upload | None | None | None |\n| AT&T Fiber 1000 Read full review | $80 | 1Gbps download and upload | None | None | None |\n| AT&T Fiber 2000 Read full review | $145 | 2Gbps download and upload | None | None | None |\n| AT&T Fiber 5000 Read full review | $245 | 5Gbps download and upload | None | None | None |\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\nT-Mobile 5G Home Internet\nGet up to $300 back when you sign up now\nT-Mobile 5G Home Internet has the greatest nationwide coverage of any single internet provider (apart from satellite internet), boasting a 60% availability, according to the latest data from the Federal Communications Commission. That's why we voted T-Mobile as the best rural internet provider. When you're rurally located, your chances of getting cable or fiber are much lower. To avoid the high costs and traditionally slow speeds of satellite internet, T-Mobile is an excellent alternative.\nT-Mobile 5G Home Internet plans and prices\n| Plan | Monthly price | Max speeds | Fees and service details |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| T-Mobile Rely Internet Read full review | $50 ($35 for eligible Go5G Plus and Magenta Max customers) | 87-318Mbps download, 14-56Mbps upload | No equipment fees, data caps or contracts. Taxes and fees included in price. |\n| T-Mobile Amplified Internet Read full review | $60 ($45 for eligible Go5G Plus and Magenta Max customers) | 133-415Mbps download, 12-55Mbps upload | No equipment fees, data caps or contracts. Taxes and fees included in price. |\n| T-Mobile All-In Internet Read full review | $70 ($55 for eligible Go5G Plus and Magenta Max customers) | 133-415Mbps download, 12-55Mbps upload | No equipment fees, data caps or contracts. Taxes and fees included in price. |\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\nSpectrum\nBest cable internet provider\nOur take - Fiber offers the most bang for your buck, but a cable connection is the next best thing if fiber isn't an option. Spectrum is the provider offering cable internet service in the country that I'd be happiest to see available at my address.\nSpectrum plans and prices\n| Plan | Starting monthly price | Max speeds | Monthly equipment fee | Data cap | Contract |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Spectrum 500 Internet Read full review | $50 | 500Mbps download, 20Mbps upload | Modem free; $10 for router (optional) | None | None |\n| Spectrum Gig Internet Read full review | $70 | 1,000Mbps download, 35Mbps upload | Modem and router free | None | None |\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\nVerizon Fios\nBest internet provider for customer care\nOur take - Verizon lands near the top of the American Customer Satisfaction Index's rankings of internet providers year after year, and it's been one of the strongest finishers with J.D. Power for multiple years running, too.\nVerizon Fios plans and prices\n| Plan | Max speeds | Starting monthly price | Monthly equipment fee | Data cap | Contract |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Fios 300 | 300Mbps download, 300Mbps upload | $50 | None | None | None |\n| Fios 500 | 500Mbps download, 500Mbps upload | $75 | None | None | None |\n| Fios 1 Gig | 940Mbps download, 880Mbps upload | $90 | None | None | None |\n| Fios 2 Gig | 2,300Mbps download, 1,500Mbps upload | $110 | None | None | None |\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\nWideOpenWest\nBest internet provider for value\nOur take - WideOpenWest is a relatively small provider that offers services in six states. It earns the exclamation point it likes to stick at the end of its branding by offering cable internet plans at some of the best prices you'll find anywhere in the US. That includes an entry-level 300Mbps plan that starts at $30 per month, reaching all the way up to a high-speed 1,200Mbps plan at $95 monthly. That's a stellar cost per Mbps of just 8 cents, which is unheard of in the cable category. In some areas, for an extra $5 a month, WOW offers price-lock to your chosen plan to protect against sudden price increases.\nWOW Internet plans and prices\n| Plan | Starting monthly price | Max speeds | Monthly equipment fee | Data Cap | Contract |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| WOW Internet 300 Read full review | $30 | 300Mbps download, 20 Mbps upload | None | None | None |\n| WOW Internet 600 Read full review | $45 | 600Mbps download, 50 Mbps upload | None | None | None |\n| WOW Internet 1 Gig Read full review | $60 | 1,000Mbps download, 50 Mbps upload | None | None | None |\n| WOW Internet 1.2 Gigs Read full review | $95 | 1,200Mbps download, 50 Mbps upload | None | None | None |\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\nHonorable mentions\nQuantum Fiber\nWorth a look if service is available\nOur take - CenturyLink offers DSL internet plans across 16 states, but roughly half of the coverage map also has access to its sibling company's fiber plans, branded as Quantum Fiber. Overall, the plans offer decent cost per Mbps, with the entry-level plan starting at $50 monthly for matching upload and download speeds of 500Mbps (10 cents per Mbps), all the way up to $165 a month for 8 gigabits with matching speeds of 8,000Mbps. There are no data caps or contracts with those plans, and, best of all, the ISP offers a price-for-life guarantee, pledging to never raise your rate for as long as you keep your plan.\nQuantum Fiber plans and prices\n| Plan | Starting monthly price | Max speeds | Monthly equipment fee | Data cap | Contract |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Quantum Fiber 500 | $50 | 500Mbps download, 500Mbps upload | None | None | None |\n| Quantum Fiber 940 | $75 | 940Mbps download, 940Mbps upload | None | None | None |\n| Quantum Fiber 2 Gig | $95 | 2,000Mbps download, 1,000Mbps upload | None | None | None |\n| Quantum Fiber 3 Gig | $100 | 3,000Mbps download, 3,000Mbps upload | None | None | None |\n| Quantum Fiber 8 Gig | $165 | 8,000Mbps download, 3,000Mbps upload | None | None | None |\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\nRise Broadband\nConvenient alternative rural internet provider\nOur take - Pickings can be frustratingly slim when shopping for an internet plan in a rural area because most of the best internet infrastructure in the country is centralized in population-dense cities and the suburban neighborhoods surrounding them. If you live outside a region like that, your home probably isn't wired for fiber or cable. Instead, you'll have to make do with slower, less reliable and more expensive technologies, and you'll likely have fewer options to choose from too.\nRise Broadband plans and prices\n| Plan | Starting monthly price | Max speeds | Monthly equipment fee | Data cap | Contract |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Rise Broadband 50 Read full review | $55 | 50Mbps download, 5Mbps upload | $10 modem; $15 router (optional) | None | None, but required for some promotions |\n| Rise Broadband 100Mbps Read full review | $75 | 100Mbps download, 15Mbps upload | $10 modem; $15 router (optional) | None | None, but required for some promotions |\n| Rise Broadband Fiber 300 Read full review | $60 | 300Mbps download, 300Mbps upload | $5 router (optional) | None | None, but required for some promotions |\n| Rise Broadband Fiber 500 Read full review | $80 | 500Mbps download, 500Mbps upload | $5 router (optional) | None | None, but required for some promotions |\n| Rise Broadband Fiber 1000 Read full review | $85 | 1Gbps download and upload | $5 router (optional) | None | None, but required for some promotions |\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\nXfinity\nFast and reliable option\nOur take - Comcast is the biggest name in cable, and the company offers its Xfinity internet service to over 100 million people in the US -- more than a third of the country. Subscribers will find a great variety of plans and packages to choose from, including download speeds of up to 2,000Mbps, that are available across the majority of the sprawling coverage map. In addition, Xfinity consistently earns above-average customer satisfaction scores too.\nXfinity plans and prices (one-year term)\n| Plan | Monthly price | Max speeds | Fees and service details |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Connect More | $40 ($83 after 12 months) | 400Mbps download, 150Mbps upload | Equipment and unlimited data free for 1 year; $15 gateway rental after 12 months |\n| Fast | $45 ($98 after 12 months) | 600Mbps download, 150Mbps upload | Equipment and unlimited data free for 1 year; $15 gateway rental after 12 months |\n| Gigabit | $50 ($108 after 12 months) | 1,100Mbps download, 300Mbps upload | Equipment and unlimited data free for 1 year; $15 gateway rental after 12 months |\n| Gigabit Extra | $70 ($113 after 12 months) | 1,300Mbps download, 300Mbps upload | Equipment and unlimited data free for 1 year; $15 gateway rental after 12 months |\n| Gigabit X2 | $90 ($116 after 12 months) | 2,000Mbps download, 300Mbps upload | Equipment and unlimited data free for 1 year; $15 gateway rental after 12 months |\n| Gigabit Pro (fiber) | $300 | 10,000Mbps download, 10,000Mbps upload | $20 gateway rental (required), unlimited data, 2-year contract |\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\nGoogle Fiber\nGreat value for high-speed internet\nOur take - It's been over a decade since Google first announced that it would bring fiber internet service to select regions across the country -- and it's been an interesting ride ever since. After initially rolling out across 11 metro areas, Google struggled to build the service beyond that. It paused its efforts in 2016, leaving disappointment across dozens of cities where the company had teased prospects for future fiber expansions.\nGoogle Fiber plans and prices\n| Plan | Starting monthly price | Max speeds | Monthly equipment fee | Data cap | Contract |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Google Fiber 1 Gig Read full review | $70 | 1Gbps download and upload | None | None | None |\n| Google Fiber 2 Gig Read full review | $100 | 2Gbps download, 1Gbps upload | None | None | None |\n| Google Fiber 5 Gig Read full review | $125 | 5Gbps download and upload | None | None | None |\n| Google Fiber 8 Gig Read full review | $150 | 8Gbps download and upload | None | None | None |\n| Google Webpass Read full review | $70 ($63 with a yearly plan) | 1Gbps download and upload | None | None | None |\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\nViasat\nBest if you're stuck with satellite\nOur take - Satellite internet is typically slow, laggy and temperamental in inclement weather, so I'd explore other options if you've got them. That's the issue; too many of us don't have other options, and satellite internet from established names like Viasat and Hughesnet are available just about everywhere.\nViasat plans and prices\n| Plan | Starting monthly price | Max speeds | Monthly equipment fee | Data cap | Contract |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Viasat Unleashed Read full review | $100-$150 | Up to 150Mbps, 3Mbps upload | $15 or $250 one-time purchase | None (850GB soft cap) | None |\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\nZiply Fiber\nOff to a strong start\nOur take - Ziply Fiber is a relative newcomer to the fiber scene after acquiring fiber-optic infrastructure in the Pacific Northwest from Frontier. The service launched in 2020 amid the pandemic, offering relatively affordable fiber plans to customers across parts of Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington.\nZiply Fiber plans and prices\n| Plan | Starting monthly price | Max speeds | Monthly equipment fee | Data cap | Contract |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Ziply Internet (DSL) | $75 | 1-115Mbps download, 7Mbps upload | $15 router (optional) | None | None |\n| Ziply Fiber 100/100 | $10 ($20 after three months) | 100Mbps download and upload | $15 router (optional) | None | None |\n| Ziply Fiber 300/300 | $30 | 300Mbps download and upload | $15 router (optional) | None | None |\n| Ziply Fiber Gig | $50 | 1Gbps download and upload | $15 router (optional) | None | None |\n| Ziply Fiber 2 Gig | $60 | 2Gbps download and upload | $15 router (optional) | None | None |\n| Ziply Fiber 5 Gig | $80 | 5Gbps download and upload | $15 router (optional) | None | None |\n| Ziply Fiber 10 Gig | $300 | 10Gbps download and upload | $15 router (optional) | None | None |\n| Ziply Fiber 50 Gig | $900 | 50Gbps download and upload | None | None | None |\nSource: CNET analysis of provider data.\nBroadband providers compared\nThe broadband beat keeps our team busy, but we'll continue evaluating internet providers and updating this post as new options emerge. Please note that the plans below show each provider's cheapest available tier. The maximum speed is the top advertised speed for that given plan, but it might not be available in your area. Overall, the best selection for you -- and the most cost-effective plan -- might be a different tier that provides a faster speed at a higher price but a better value.

This is especially true if you live in a rural or underserved portion of the US. We recommend carefully considering your household's activities so you can better determine the download and upload speeds necessary to meet your needs. With that knowledge, you can better tackle plan pricing that will fit your budget and broadband demands.\nFor more comprehensive tips on finding the top internet plan for your household, check out CNET's 10 tips to help you get the most out of your internet service.\nDownload and upload speeds\nFor most of us, our internet use mainly focuses on our download speeds. Your download speed determines how easily you can stream the latest hit Netflix show or how fast you can load your favorite Amazon shopping page. The slower your download speeds, the longer it takes to do tasks on the internet. For example, Netflix suggests 15Mbps or higher to watch programming in ultra HD (to take full advantage of that 4K TV you bought).\nAs for uploads, most of us couldn't care less about our upload speeds before the pandemic. Once we started excessively video chatting with friends and family, taking Zoom calls with business colleagues and sending files and homework to our bosses and teachers, we discovered its importance too.\nConsidering what types of activities dominate your household will affect what level of download speed you'll need. Do you work remotely from home? Are you living in a household full of kids with their own devices? Have you recently downsized and are an empty nester? Take stock of how many devices are in your home and what kind of internet users you have. You can refer to our internet speed guide for a quick explainer on determining what speeds you may need.\nPlan pricing\nAt first glance, you might think it's easy to spot good plan pricing. The cheaper the monthly fee, the better the price, right? Maybe. Because internet providers are not the most transparent (a Consumer Reports broadband study noted that customers found internet bills to be \"extremely confusing\"), one low monthly rate might not equal the next.\nKeep an eye out for promo rates that expire quickly. Most enticing, low starting prices won't last, and you may pay more for low speeds in the long term. Also, look for hidden fees and/or pricing traps that may add to your monthly expenses. For example, some providers don't include equipment rentals in their monthly rates. That could add another $5 to $15 to your monthly bill.\nLastly, one good way to determine value is by examining the cost per Mbps. You might find a 75Mbps plan for $20 monthly from one provider and a 250Mbps plan for $30 monthly from another. Before you sign up for that $20 plan, consider that the cost per Mbps is just under 27 cents. The 250Mbps plan, on the other hand, chimes in at 12 cents per Mbps, so it's a better value -- more than 50% cheaper per Mbps -- and you get more than three times the download speed.\nCustomer satisfaction\nJust as you might search the internet for recommendations on a good local restaurant, it can be helpful to research customers' experiences with an ISP before you sign up. CNET has found it helpful to lean on the annual ISP surveys from the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, but many resources are available. Learning about constant network interruptions, a negligent help desk or frequent billing mistakes can be valuable info for choosing (or avoiding) certain providers.\nInternet connection types\nThere are six major types of internet available: fiber, cable, 5G, fixed wireless, DSL and satellite. Each of these internet technologies provides different quirks and benefits. Our CNET experts share their experiences with each internet connection type to better illustrate some differences.\nFiber\nFiber internet is the gold standard if you can get it. It's often called \"future-proof,\" meaning that it offers some of the fastest plans available and features symmetrical download and upload speeds. It's more reliable than cable and is less prone to outages or network congestion. AT&T, Google and Verizon are among the major players that offer fiber-optic internet, but unfortunately, fiber internet is one of the least available internet connection types in the country. To learn whether this connection is right for your household, read our explainer on fiber internet.\nCable\nCable internet supplies your internet connection through the same cables (often a hybrid fiber and copper line) that providers use for TV services. It's more reliable than satellite internet and offers faster download speeds. Often, cable internet is bundled with TV to get consumers to buy higher-priced packages to get a deal on internet service. Companies like Cox, Spectrum and Xfinity offer cable internet for competitive prices.\n5G home internet/Fixed wireless\n5G home internet and fixed wireless go hand-in-hand: 5G home internet services are fixed wireless internet services. Not all fixed wireless services are 5G home internet offerings. Fixed wireless service means the connection between your provider and home is not wired. That fixed wireless connection can come via cellular networks or satellite. Fixed wireless networks tend to be slower and more laggy than wired connections. You're also subject to network congestion and speed throttling during peak usage hours. The promise of 5G home internet from companies like Starry, T-Mobile and Verizon is speeds that match up favorably to cable connections. Is it there yet? Not quite, but my CNET colleague is optimistic about 5G home internet's potential.\nDSL\nDSL, or digital subscriber line, uses telephone lines to provide internet connectivity to users. Companies like AT&T, CenturyLink and Frontier offer DSL internet. The good news is those copper lines are prevalent across the country. The not-so-good news is that download speeds fall short of what cable internet can offer. In some cases, your speeds might even be slower than satellite internet.\nSatellite\nSatellite internet is the one broadband connection type currently available to people in the rural areas of all 50 states. As a solid alternative for those without access to DSL, cable or fiber internet, satellite internet links a modem in your home to a satellite in space, sending the internet back to Earth. Typically, satellite internet features slower speeds -- though Starlink has certainly disrupted expectations for satellite internet and raised the bar way up. Note that, like 5G home internet and other fixed wireless offerings, satellite internet is subject to network congestion and speed throttling.\nHow CNET chose the best internet providers\nInternet service providers are numerous and regional. Unlike the latest smartphone, laptop, router or kitchen tool, it's impractical to personally test every internet service provider in a given city. What's our approach? For starters, we tap into a proprietary pricing, availability and speed database that draws from our own historical ISP data, partner data and mapping information from the Federal Communications Commission at FCC.gov.\nIt doesn't end there: We go to the FCC's website to check our data and ensure we consider every ISP that provides service in an area. We also input local addresses on provider websites to find specific options for residents. We look at sources, including the American Customer Satisfaction Index and J.D. Power, to evaluate how happy customers are with an ISP's service. ISP plans and prices are subject to frequent changes; all information provided is accurate as of publication.\nOnce we have this localized information, we ask three main questions:\n- Does the provider offer access to reasonably fast internet speeds?\n- Do customers get decent value for what they're paying?\n- Are customers happy with their service?\nThe answers to those questions are often layered and complex, but the providers that come closest to \u201cyes\u201d on all three are the ones we recommend. When selecting the cheapest internet service, we look for the plans with the lowest monthly fee, although we also factor in things like price increases, equipment fees and contracts. Choosing the fastest internet service is relatively straightforward. We look at advertised upload and download speeds and consider real-world speed data from sources like Ookla and FCC reports. (Disclosure: Ookla is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\nTo explore our process in more depth, visit our how we test ISPs page.\nWhat's the final word on the best internet providers?\nFinding the right ISP is easier said than done, especially if you live in a rural part of the country with limited options for getting online. Fiber internet is almost always the best internet connection type, but we recognize that many Americans don't currently have access to fiber internet.\nSome providers we listed might not be the perfect fit for your situation. Often, the best provider is simply the one available at your address. We recommend carefully considering your household's activities so you can better determine your broadband demands.\nBest internet providers FAQ\nWhat's the cheapest way to get internet?\nThat depends.\nOne of the cheapest ways to get internet service is through government programs available for low-income families, as well as for seniors and students. To find out what low-cost internet programs are available at your address, check out our low-income state-by-state internet guide.\nLastly, you can try negotiating with your current internet provider to secure a lower rate on your broadband service. You can also keep your eyes open for internet providers that offer cheap internet, broadband deals or other internet promotions each month.\nWhat's the fastest internet provider?\nThe good news is that gigabit plans are now common and offered by almost all major ISPs. As we often say, the fastest internet service for you will depend on your location and specific address. Xfinity and Optimum often extend the fastest plans available for residential homes, with a 10,000Mbps and an 8,000Mbps plan, respectively. Those aren't as widely available and may require a site survey to ensure serviceability.\nIn 2022, a Chattanooga, Tennessee, provider announced it was offering a 25Gbps plan. Although that's impressive, Ziply Fiber subsequently released a 50-gigabit plan. That's ridiculously fast and pretty cool, though you probably don't need that much speed in your household. To avoid paying for speeds you don't need, read our guide on how much speed your household needs.\nWhat is the most powerful internet company?\nIf fast is what you\u2019re looking for, Ziply Fiber has two of the fastest internet plans of any major ISP, with advertised symmetrical upload and download speeds of up to 10,000Mbps and 50,000Mbps. If you're more interested in customer care and value, Verizon offers the best sign-up bonuses among high-speed internet providers.\nWhat provider has the best Wi-Fi coverage?\nSince internet providers tend to operate in specific areas, the provider with the best Wi-Fi coverage will depend on where you live. Currently, T-Mobile 5G Home Internet is available in 49 states and has 65% nationwide coverage.\nWhat internet speed do I need?\nIn March of 2024, the FCC raised the minimum standard of \"broadband speeds\" to 100Mbps download and 20Mbps upload. Most providers now offer a gigabit plan, but most households won't need that much speed. According to OpenVault's first quarter 2024 report, the average American household uses approximately 520Mbps download speeds (although nearly 33% of households get less than 200 to 400Mbps). Does that mean you'll need that much? Not necessarily. The internet speed you need will depend on how many people use the internet in your home and for what activities.\nShould I self-install my internet or have a professional do it?\nMost internet providers offer a self-installation option, where they'll mail you your home internet equipment after you sign up for service, and you'll set it up yourself on your own time. In most cases, the process is straightforward, with clear instructions on how to plug everything in correctly. In some cases, opting for self-installation can save you money, too.\nAll of that makes self-installation a great option for homes that don't require much labor to get a network up and running -- for instance, if you're setting up a cable internet modem and your home already has the necessary coaxial wiring running through your walls. Check with your provider when you sign up to see if it's an option for you, how much work it would entail and how much money you could save compared to letting the pros handle it.\nWhat is a Tier 1 ISP?\nTier 1 internet providers have direct access to the network, letting them offer services directly to customers without relying on other providers. A few Tier 1 ISPs include AT&T, Verizon and CenturyLink, which all have extensive networks and complete control of their network and routing.\nHow many ISPs are there in the US?\nApproximately 2,000 ISPs operate in the US, including national, regional and local providers. Some offer nationwide coverage, but others cater to specific areas or communities.\nWhich internet service providers offer bundles?\nIf you\u2019re considering home internet and TV service, bundling can save you time and money. Companies like AT&T, Cox Communications and Frontier offer internet and television packages, but you can read more at CNET's list of the best internet and TV bundles and or internet and mobile bundles. Other providers like Astound, Spectrum, T-Mobile and Verizon may offer to bundle your internet with a mobile plan."

      "text": "If you've been considering ways to replace cable, live TV streaming services offer a convenient method of watching cable channels without a contract. These cable replacements are streamed over the internet, but unlike on-demand services such as Netflix, they let you channel surf among the most popular live channels. For a flat monthly fee, these services offer can watch sports, news broadcasts, primetime TV shows, and we have compared all of the apps on mobile devices, streaming sticks and smart TV. Plus, as many of these services offer unlimited recordings, you can record all of your shows and watch them later.\nOur Picks\nWhile the live TV streaming available today is more sophisticated than ever, some services cost the same as the cable they are designed to replace. Indeed, pricing and channel availability are in a constant state of flux. After recent increases YouTube TV is now $83, DirecTV bumped its price up to $87, Fubo's basic package now costs $85 and Hulu Plus Live TV is now $83. Meanwhile, Fubo and Hulu have announced they would merge -- pending regulatory approval. But change is all part of the brave new world of live TV streaming over the internet. Here's what you need to know.\nWant to save even more money? See the Best Free TV Streaming Services: Plex, Pluto TV and more.\nWhat's the best live TV streaming service overall?\nWe've tested all of the popular paid live TV streaming services including Sling TV, Hulu Plus Live TV, DirecTV, Philo and Fubo. Among this competition, our top choices in this category are Hulu Plus Live TV and the budget-friendly Sling TV. At the affordable end of the spectrum, Sling's Blue package carries many basic channels for $46 a month, while Hulu's live offerings include a Disney streaming bundle for $83. Each service provides a user-friendly layout and a blend of live channels with unlimited DVRs and on-demand content. Beyond those two, all of the cancel-anytime live TV bundles we've evaluated on this list allow you to watch local and national news and live sports and events. You can stream live channels such as CNN, NBC, ESPN and Fox on a host of different devices. You can compare the services' channel lineups here.\nBest live TV streaming services of 2025\nBest for on-demand\nHulu Plus Live TV\nPros\n- Unlimited DVR\n- Inclusion of Disney Plus and Hulu on-demand content\n- Solid channel roster\nCons\n- Price hike\n- YouTube TV's channels are better\nFor people who ant the best mix of live streaming and on-demand, Hulu Plus Live TV is the best service to subscribe to. Its channel selection may not be as robust as YouTube TV, but it's almost there -- especially with the addition of PBS and Magnolia. Yet, it's Hulu's significant catalog of on-demand content that helps set it apart. Hulu's exclusive titles include Shogun and Only Murders in the Building, plus it has a massive catalog of broadcast programming, which grant it a content advantage no other service can match. The $83 service includes an unlimited DVR plus the ad-supported version of the Disney Bundle (Hulu Basic, Disney Plus and ESPN Plus), and if you want the ad-free bundle, the price is $96.\nIn terms of usability, the interface is friendly with plenty of options for content discovery, and all of the sections are clearly marked. Like most of its competition it has an unlimited DVR so there's plenty of space for any program you feel like bingeing on. The only annoyance is that if you want to record a show while you're watching it live, you need to exit to the guide to press the record button.\nIn January, Hulu announced it was merging with Fubo in a deal which would end the litigation between the two companies over the Venu Sports streaming service. The merger is subject to regulatory approval and no official date has yet been set.\nGiven that Hulu Plus Live TV offers you more with its live channels, namely a whole bunch of on-demand content, it's currently the service to choose for live TV streaming.\nTop channels not available on Hulu Plus Live TV: AMC, BBC America and NBA TV.\nBest cable alternative\nYouTube TV\nPros\n- More channels than competitors\n- Excellent on-screen interface and handy search bar\n- Great cloud DVR\nCons\n- $20 upgrade doesn't include much 4K content\n- On the pricier side\nYouTube TV has more top channels than any competitor at this price, and it was the first service to include local PBS stations -- Hulu and DirecTV Stream followed suit later. Despite a $10 price hike in January 2025, YouTube TV service has an excellent cloud DVR, including both unlimited storage and a generous nine months to watch recordings (most rivals offer 30 days).\nThe user interface is no-nonsense, though it has had a little spruce-up of late, and is now easier to use than ever. The service it offers most of the features a cable service can give you include time shifting and it is also the only one to offer surround sound on live broadcasts.\nYouTube TV is the exclusive home of NFL Sunday Ticket through the 2029-2030 season, with monthly payment plans available. In addition, the video streaming service has a $20 monthly upgrade that lets you watch a limited number of 4K livestreams, download DVR recordings to your devices and watch an unlimited number of simultaneous streams (up from three).\nWhile Hulu throws in Disney for the same money, and Sling TV is even cheaper, YouTube TV is still worth subscribing to if you want a tightly integrated search and a great channel selection.\nTop channels not available on YouTube TV: A&E, History, Lifetime and MLB\nPros\n- Excellent value with decent channel selection\n- Numerous choices and add-ons\n- Optional AirTV 2 tuner for local channels\nCons\n- No local channels beyond ABC, NBC and Fox in a few cities\n- Limited DVR\n- AirTV channels don't work on browsers or Apple TV\nIf you're looking for the cheapest live TV streaming service, and one that is still able to offer a usable amount of channels, then it's without a doubt Sling TV Blue. Yet, things are a little more complicated than they are for Sling's competitors. You see, Sling tenders two different $45-ish-per-month live TV streaming channel packages, Sling Orange and Sling Blue. While a number of live TV channels are common to both, Orange is essentially the ESPN/Disney package, while Blue is the Fox/Discovery package. Meanwhile, Orange & Blue combines the two offerings for $61.\nIn 2023, Sling added ABC to eight markets and you now pay $46 a month regardless of whether you receive one local channel or three. As a result, Sling TV costs up to $20 more than Philo, yet it still has better channels, more options and a comparatively better live TV streaming interface. Sling is also cheaper than most other streaming services, let alone cable, but it is a little hampered by its 50 hour DVR cap while most competitors have unlimited recordings. You can add Unlimited DVR to Sling for an extra $5 a month.\nWhile Sling doesn't have a free trial, though it is currently offering half price for the first month, but it does offer a cut-down version called Freestream with a number of included channels.\nTop channels not available on Sling Blue: CBS, Animal Planet, Disney Channel, ESPN and Nickelodeon. ABC, Fox and NBC are available in select markets.\nTop channels not available on Sling Orange: ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, Animal Planet, Bravo, CNBC, Discovery Channel, Bravo, Fox News, Fox Sports 1, FX, MSNBC and USA Network.\nPros\n- Good for channel surfers\n- Offers most regional sports networks on higher tier\nCons\n- Expensive\n- Not as many non-sports channels as competitors\nDIrecTV, formerly known as DirecTV Stream, is the most expensive service at $87, but it does have some pluses, including the flipper-friendly ability to swipe left and right to change channels. The service also offers unlimited DVR capability to new users, while existing subscribers need to pay an extra $10 a month.\nDirecTV recently announced its Genre Packs, starting at $35, which slim down channel offerings into compact packages. These are MySports for $70 a month, MyEntertainment (which includes more than 40 channels, such as Food and FX), MyNews and MiEspa\u00f1ol. Subscribers can add Mini Packs to these, which include sports and movies.\nFor cord-cutters who want to follow their local NBA or MLB team, DirecTV's $130 Choice package is a competitive live TV sports pick, because it has access to more regional sports networks than the competition. Additionally, DirecTV includes channels some other services can't, including almost 250 local PBS stations.\nTop channels not available in base package: MLB Network, NFL Network and Travel Channel.\nWatch live and on-demand TV from 100-plus top channels, including sports and news. Stream full seasons of exclusive series, hit movies, current episodes, Hulu Originals and more on Hulu, along with endless entertainment on Disney Plus and live sports on ESPN Plus.\nHow we test live TV streaming services\nWe have ordered these services based on the score each streaming service received in their individual review, and based on a number of criteria including the number of platforms, ease of use, features, cost and channels. We test each service's apps on multiple platforms including Android, iOS, Apple TV, Google TV and internet browsers, and note whenever features aren't available on some of them.\nDesign: We take into account the design of the service including its ease of use, and the layout of the program guide -- for example, how easy it it to find the content you want, or to record a show?\nContent: A live TV streaming service is only as good as the channels it offers, and we take into account the number of popular channels it supports. We also note any sports offerings, add-on packages, plus the quality of originals and back catalog content.\nValue: In terms of price, there are three tiers of live TV streaming services: free, budget and premium. While we cover free services here, the budget tier includes services like Philo and Sling TV, while the premium services like YouTube TV cost from $80 and up. We try to balance the other factors such as content and features, and how much they correlate to your \"bang for buck.\"\nFeatures: We pay special attention to features like 4K HDR, DVR and number of multiple streams, as well as unique features such as DirecTV's \"channel flipping\" mechanic which helps the service feel more cable like.\nLive TV streaming services we also tested\n- Philo: This $28 live TV streaming service offers a variety of channels, but it lacks sports channels, local stations and big-name news networks -- although Cheddar and BBC news are available. Philo offers bread-and-butter cable staples like AMC, Comedy Channel, Nickelodeon and Magnolia Network (formerly DIY), and specializes in lifestyle and reality programming. It now includes an unlimited cloud DVR and optional add-ons from Epix and Starz. We think most people are better off paying extra for Sling TV's superior service, but if Philo has every channel you want, it's a decent deal. Read our Philo review.\n- Fubo: There's a lot to like about Fubo -- it offers a wide selection of channels, and its sports focus makes it especially attractive to football fans of all kinds. For NFL in particular, it's one of three services, alongside YouTube TV and Hulu, with NFL Network and optional RedZone. In addition, it's also suited to NBA, NHL and MLB fans who live in an area served by one of Fubo's RSNs. The biggest hole in Fubo's lineup is the lack of Turner networks, including CNN, TNT and TBS -- especially since the latter two carry a lot of sports content. Those missing channels and the 2024 price bump that increased plans by $5 (plus additional RSN fees) make it less attractive than YouTube TV or Hulu for most viewers. Read our Fubo review here, and catch up on Fubo's merger with Hulu here.\nWhile you are most likely familiar with the services on this list, it's not fully reflective of every live TV platform available. If you're looking for free TV there are a number of services, while OTA (over the air) is also available if you hang an antenna.\nBest live TV streaming services\nFactors to consider for cord-cutting live TV services\nIf you want a cable-like experience at home and for on-the-go devices, without the dead weight that a cable subscription brings, a streaming service is worth a look. There's no contract to sign, and if you don't like the service you're on, you can easily switch. Whether you're looking for a basic package such as Sling TV or want to pay more for a deluxe experience from the likes of Hulu Plus Live TV, there should be a live TV streaming service to suit you. Here's some questions to help you get started:\n- Does the service offer your \"must-have\" channels? See CNET's comparison of the top 100 channels here.\n- Does it offer local channels in your area?\n- How good is the cloud DVR?\n- Does the interface make it easy to browse for shows?\n- Are there enough simultaneous streams for you and your family?\n- Is your internet connection up to snuff? See CNET's guide to improving streaming quality here.\nChannels: Each of the TV streaming services above offers a different mix of channels, so your first step should be choosing one that carries your \"can't miss\" cable channels and shows. Some of the most important live channels are local, namely ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC. Not every service offers all of them in every area, but the best streaming service for you will include the majority of what you love to watch, so it's worth shopping around.\nThe live TV streaming service lineups are in constant flux as networks scramble to secure access to popular channels (ones with highly watched original shows and regional sports networks are especially in demand). There's also the chance that a certain cable channel could disappear from a certain service after a network contract expires, which is what happened in 2020 with the regional sports networks.\nThese negotiations lead to other changes, too. Over the past few years, YouTube TV, Sling TV, Hulu (multiple times), Philo and DirecTV have all raised their prices. Google and Roku resolved a contract dispute that prevented their users from downloading the YouTube TV app, but they lost Disney channels for two days due to a different dispute. Adding to this volatility is the fact that sometimes less popular services are simply phased out -- AT&T TV Watch TV, TVision and PlayStation Vue are just three examples.\nPrice: Broadly, each of these streaming services can be broken down into two main groups: budget, with prices ranging between $25 and $50 and few or no local channels; and premium, with prices from $80 and up, and local channels and supercharged cloud DVRs. That's right, all of the services allow you to record and playback shows, just like a traditional cable or satellite DVR, but they often come with restrictions.\nNumber of simultaneous users: If you want to watch more than one program at the same time -- for example, on your living room TV and on a bedroom TV, or the main TV and a tablet or other devices -- you'll want to make sure the video streaming service you're watching has enough simultaneous streams. Sling Orange only allows one stream at a time, and if you try to watch a second, it's blocked. Other services have higher simultaneous stream limits.\nKeep in mind that, especially if you do have more than one person watching at once on supported devices, you need to make sure you have fast, reliable broadband internet. A 100Mbps download service will cost around $50 to $60 a month, and sadly that's where the savings of cutting cable can get swallowed up.\nReasons not to choose streaming TV services\nStreaming TV services are great, but there are some things they can't do compared with a traditional cable box. First, it's worth looking at the channels that you can't get with any of these live TV streaming services. For example, only there of the services are currently able to offer PBS: YouTube TV and DirecTV and Hulu Plus Live TV\nWith sports, fans want to make sure they can find the sports channels to follow their teams. Most services carry ESPN and local channels for NFL football, but if you follow a professional baseball or basketball team, you might need its specific channel -- called a regional sports network or RSN -- to watch regular season games. RSN coverage varies widely for each service. Sometimes, even if you live in the right area, you may be mistakenly blacked out due to an IP address error. If this is the case, you can fix this by signing up for a sports-friendly VPN.\nEvery live TV service's video streaming is a few seconds to a minute or more behind the \"live\" stream you'll get from your local cable TV or satellite provider. That means you could get a preview of scores or big plays from Twitter, phone alerts or calls from friends slightly before you see the action on screen.\nIf you're used to 5.1-channel surround offered by cable or even OTA, then you may be disappointed that YouTube is the only service to offer surround sound on live broadcasts. The other services include stereo sound only on live channels, though 5.1 audio is available on some on-demand material."
