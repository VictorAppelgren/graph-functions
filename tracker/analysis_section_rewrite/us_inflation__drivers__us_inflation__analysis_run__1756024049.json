      "feedback": "Overall, the analysis is solid in framing a macro/policy tug-of-war and using explicit numbers, but it needs sharpening to world-class quality. Actionable edits: prune non-market drivers (e.g., U.S. urban crime dynamics) unless you can tie them to risk sentiment or insure/expense costs, and remove or replace the undefined “IntelOrbis Graph horizon” with a concise horizon tied to S&P 500 drivers; fix the line about IBM’s hiring pause as a productivity catalyst—clarify whether this is a direct earnings/AI-productivity signal and cite the exact source. Rebuild the causal chain from first principles: start with a regime map (sticky inflation vs disinflation path) and the real-rate differential (Fed ~4.5% vs euro ~0.5% real rate) to explain the prob-weighted path for a Sept 50bp cut, the dollar path, and the transmission to spreads and capex; then translate those into equity outcomes via discount-rate/multiple dynamics (explicitly connect 300–350bp spread compression and 1.8–2.2% dividend yields to earnings/valuation changes). Strengthen scenario structure (base/bull/bear) with explicit probabilities and numeric implications for S&P levels under each; for example, quantify how a 2–3% dollar decline and 300–350bp spread compression would lift multiples or earnings yields, and what oil supply/demand pivots imply for inflation and capex. Tighten the watch-list to decisive, time-stamped signals (CPI prints, September cut clarity, dollar levels, spreads, oil-supply shocks, tariff/regulatory moves) and provide clear invalidation points (e.g., CPI surprise >X, Fed path shifts, or oil price breakouts beyond Y). Ensure every claim has a cited source from the IDs in SOURCE MATERIAL, and reconcile conflicts (e.g., oil oversupply vs. demand weakness vs. tariff/deregulation signals) by presenting a single, integrated transmission view with explicit source-backed ranges (e.g., use the 2.7% CPI (V7GV8YBQU), 70% Sep-cut odds (C3ODMIQKZ), 2.5 mbpd 2025 supply rise (J99EM2TPZ), and 90-day tariff-truce extension (RHXDOHQQX)); finally, improve formatting to a tight, single-paragraph narrative that maps macro → policy → flows/positioning → valuation/technicals, with explicit numerical anchors and a concise, sourced watch-list.",
