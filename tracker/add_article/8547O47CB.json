      "summary": "The article compares common metals for computer heatsinks, noting that copper (401 W/mK) and aluminum (205 W/mK) are the most widely used due to their balance of conductivity, cost, weight, and manufacturability. Silver offers higher conductivity (≈430 W/mK) but is expensive and less durable, while diamond and graphene have superior thermal properties but are impractical for mass production. The choice of material ultimately depends on trade‑offs among thermal performance, weight, durability, and cost.",
