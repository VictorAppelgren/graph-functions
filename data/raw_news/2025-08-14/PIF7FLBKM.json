  "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin lavished praise on President Trump ahead of their high-stakes summit in Alaska, while Trump expressed optimism ahead of the talks.",
  "content": "Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Keir Starmer walks with Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky in the garden at 10 Downing St. on Thursday.\n\nVladimir Putin is lavishing praise on President Trump ahead of their high-stakes summit in Alaska on Friday, thanking his host for \u201cenergetic and sincere efforts to stop the fighting\u201d in Ukraine over three years since the Russian leader attempted to conquer the country.\n\nTrump, at the White House, also expressed optimism ahead of the talks, telling reporters he believes Putin \u201cwould like to see a deal\u201d after suffering more than a million Russian casualties on the battlefield.\n\nYet Russian Foreign Ministry officials said Wednesday that Putin\u2019s war aims remain \u201cunchanged.\u201d And an aggressive Russian advance along the front lines this week provided evidence to military analysts that Moscow has no plans to implement a ceasefire.\n\nIt was a day of diplomatic maneuvering ahead of an extraordinary visit from a Russian president to the U.S. homeland, and the first audience Putin has received with a Western leader since the war began.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very interesting \u2014 we\u2019re going to find out where everybody stands,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday. \u201cIf it\u2019s a bad meeting, it\u2019ll end very quickly. And if it\u2019s a good meeting, we\u2019re going to end up getting peace in the very near future.\u201d\n\nPutin\u2019s positioning ahead of the summit, and Trump\u2019s eagerness for a deal, continue to fuel worries across Europe and in Ukraine that the Alaska negotiations could result in a bilateral agreement designed by Moscow and endorsed by Washington that sidelines Kyiv.\n\nIn London, Britain\u2019s prime minister, Keir Starmer, hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday, offering support for Trump\u2019s effort while placing the onus on Putin to \u201cprove he is serious about peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey agreed there had been a powerful sense of unity and a strong resolve to achieve a just and lasting peace in Ukraine,\u201d 10 Downing Street said in a statement.\n\nTrump said the Alaska summit, to be held at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, is meant to \u201cset the table\u201d for direct talks between Putin and Zelensky that could include himself and European leaders.\n\nBut addressing reporters, Trump suggested that denying Putin dominion over all of Ukraine \u2014 and allowing him to hold on to the territories he has seized militarily \u2014 would be concession enough from Moscow. The president had said in recent days that land \u201cswapping\u201d would be part of an ultimate peace settlement, a statement rejected by Kyiv.\n\n\u201cI think President Putin would like to see a deal,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think if I weren\u2019t president, he would take over all of Ukraine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am president, and he\u2019s not going to mess around with me,\u201d he added.\n\nRussian state media reported Thursday that Putin had gathered his advisors to inform them of \u201chow the negotiation process on the Ukrainian crisis is going.\u201d\n\nTrump, \u201cin my opinion, quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the fighting, stop the crisis and reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved in this conflict,\u201d Putin said.\n\nBut U.S. efforts to get Russia to halt the fighting have proved futile for months, with Moscow pressing forward in an offensive that has secured incremental gains on the battlefield.\n\n\u201cPutin thinks that he is winning this war militarily,\u201d said Frederick Kagan, director of the Critical Threats Project, which collaborates with the Institute for the Study of War to produce daily battlefield assessments on the conflict. \u201cHe\u2019s also confident that Western support for Ukraine, and particularly U.S. support, will break, and that when it does, Ukraine will collapse, and he\u2019ll be able to take control of the whole thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been his theory of victory for a long time,\u201d Kagan said, \u201cand it\u2019s a huge part of the problem, because he\u2019s not going to make any concessions so long as he\u2019s confident that he\u2019s winning.\u201d\n\nRussian incursions along a strategic portion of the front line, near a crucial Ukrainian logistics hub, spooked Ukraine\u2019s supporters earlier this week. While serious, Kagan said that Russia does not hold the territory, and said that the conditions for offensive Russian operations had been set over the course of months.\n\n\u201cThe Russians continue to have the initiative, and they continue to make gains,\u201d he added. \u201cThe first step in changing Putin\u2019s calculation about the war is to urgently help the Ukrainians stop the gains.\u201d\n\nZelensky, after meeting with Starmer in London, said that he and the British leader had \u201cdiscussed expectations for the meeting in Alaska and possible prospects.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe also discussed in considerable detail the security guarantees that can make peace truly durable,\u201d Zelensky said, \u201cif the United States succeeds in pressing Russia to stop the killings and engage in genuine, substantive diplomacy.\u201d\n\nTrump and Putin plan on arriving of the U.S. airbase within moments of one another, and are expected to meet on the tarmac before retreating into a private meeting.\n\nAfterward, Trump and Putin will take questions from the press, the White House said.",

      "text": "Russia's Vladimir Putin sounded positive Thursday on the eve of his talks with President Donald Trump in Alaska, saying he believed the American leader was making \"quite energetic and sincere efforts\" toward peace in Ukraine.\nA day ahead of their summit, Putin convened a meeting of advisers to inform them \"about how the negotiation process on the Ukrainian crisis is going,\" the Kremlin said in a readout translated by NBC News.\nThe Russian leader said the Trump administration is making \"quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the fighting, stop the crisis and reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved in this conflict.\"\nThose efforts are intended \"to create long-term conditions of peace between our countries and in Europe, and in the world as a whole,\" he added, particularly if the negotiations are extended to cover strategic offensive weapons treaties.\nThis suggests that a deal on nuclear arms control could be part of the talks. Russia suspended its participation in the New START \"reduction in strategic offensive arms\" agreement in 2023.\nEarlier Thursday, Putin aide Yuri Ushakov said the summit would start with head-to-head talks between Trump, Putin and their translators at 11:30 a.m. local time (3:30 p.m. ET) and would be followed by a joint news conference. The White House later confirmed this.\nTrump \"wants to exhaust all options to try to bring this war to a peaceful resolution,\" press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Fox News.\nThe top-level Russian delegation will include Putin, Ushakov, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Defense Minister Andrei Belousov, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Putin's longtime friend and investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev, Ushakov said on a call with journalists in Moscow.\nThe primary topic of the meeting will be Ukraine, he said, but he added that he expected the \"huge, and unfortunately hitherto untapped, potential\" of economic ties between the U.S. and Russia would also be discussed.\nAs well as Putin's openly stated goal of subjugating Ukraine, he also wants to end Russia's exile from the Western financial system following economic sanctions imposed by Washington, the European Union and others. Trump has not yet lifted these punishments but has expressed a desire to end Russia's economic pariah status.\nNBC News asked Trump in a press gaggle on Thursday whether he would offer Putin access to rare earth minerals as an incentive to end the war with Ukraine.\n\"We\u2019re going to see what happens with our meeting. We have a big meeting. It\u2019s going to be, I think, very important for Russia, and it\u2019s going to be very important for us,\" Trump said, without offering additional details. He later added that the earth minerals are \u201cvery unimportant\u201d compared to \u201ctrying to save lives.\u201d\nThe talks come as Ukraine marked a grim new record with 286 civilians killed and 1,388 injured in July, according to the United Nations.\n\u201cFor the second month in a row, the number of civilian casualties in Ukraine hits a new three-year high,\u201d Danielle Bell, the head of the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU), said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cOnly the first three months after the Russian Federation launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine saw more killed and injured than in this past month.\u201d\nThe Trump-Putin summit has prompted howls of dismay and anxiety across Ukraine and Europe, which have not been invited to the talks and fear what the American president may agree to with his Russian counterpart about the conflict raging on their continent.\nThey have been confined to their own diplomatic scrambling, including dozens of calls between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other leaders, culminating in a video call between these parties and Trump himself Wednesday.\nZelenskyy said that Putin \u201cis bluffing\u201d in saying he wants peace.\nOn Thursday, the Ukrainian leader flew to London and met his British counterpart, Prime Minister Keir Starmer, for what both called a \"productive meeting.\" As well as the prospect of Britain financing the small drones that have become central to Ukraine's battlefield defense, the pair discussed the Alaska talks, \"which present a viable chance to make progress as long as Putin takes action to prove he is serious about peace,\" a spokesperson from Starmer's office, No. 10 Downing St., said in a statement.\nAfter Wednesday's call with Zelenskyy, Starmer and others, Trump said he had assured them that there would be \"very severe consequences\" \u2014 without elaborating what those might be \u2014 if Putin did not agree to end the war during their sit-down discussion.\nTwo European officials and three other people briefed on the call told NBC News that he told them he would not discuss possible divisions of territory with the man flying in from the Kremlin."

      "text": "- Share via\nLANGLEY, Va. \u2014 At CIA headquarters, beyond the handsome granite seal on its lobby floor and a wall of stars carved in honor of the agency\u2019s fallen, experts are at work in the complex tasks of spycraft: weapons-trained officers, computer engineers, virologists, nuclear scientists.\nBut there are also storytellers, makeup artists, theater majors and ballerinas \u2014 Americans who probably never thought their skills would match the needs of a spy agency. Yet the CIA thought otherwise.\nThough it rarely gets the spotlight, there\u2019s a revolving door of talent between the country\u2019s premiere intelligence agency and its entertainment industry, with inspiration and influence often working both ways.\nThe agency is targeting professionals at the intersection of arts and technology for recruitment, CIA officers told The Times, and continues to cooperate with entertainment giants to inspire the next generation of creative spies.\nThis month, the agency is assisting a New York Times bestselling author on a young adult book examining the foundations of the CIA laid during World War II. Scenes from a major upcoming film production were just shot at its headquarters, a logistical feat at an intelligence campus tucked away in the Virginia suburbs behind rings of security perimeters, where officers roam cracking down on Bluetooth signals. Another popular streaming TV series will be back at Langley to film this fall.\nBut their collaboration goes far deeper than that, officers said. Creative minds in Hollywood and the entertainment industry have long had a role at the Central Intelligence Agency, devising clever solutions to its most vexing problems, such as perfecting the art of disguise and harnessing a magician\u2019s ability to cast spellbinding illusions. Indeed, in the 1950s, a magician from New York named John Mulholland was secretly contracted with the agency to write a manual for Cold War spies on trickery and deception.\nThese days, the officers said, creative skills are more valuable than ever in such a technologically complex world.\n\u201cYou\u2019re only limited by your own imagination \u2014 don\u2019t self-censor your ideas,\u201d said Janelle, a CIA public affairs officer, granted the ability to speak under her first name at the request of the agency. \u201cWe\u2019re always looking for partners.\u201d\nAn elusive history\nDavid McCloskey, a former CIA analyst and author of \u201cDamascus Station\u201d and other spy thrillers, offered several theories on why the agency might be interested in fostering a robust relationship with Hollywood, calling it \u201ca two-way street.\u201d\n\u201cThere definitely have been operational applications for espionage,\u201d McCloskey said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the exception to the rule, but when it happens, it\u2019s compelling.\u201d\nIt\u2019s easy to see why CIA leaders would be interested in Hollywood, he said, in part to shape impressions of the agency. \u201cBut their bread and butter business is receiving people to give secrets,\u201d he continued, \u201cand part of that is getting close to people in power.\u201d\n\u201cThe closer you are to Hollywood,\u201d McCloskey added, \u201cthat\u2019s a really interesting \u2018in\u2019 to having a lot of interesting conversations.\u201d\nSome of the CIA\u2019s most iconic missions \u2014 at least the declassified ones \u2014 document the agency\u2019s rich history with Hollywood, including Canadian Caper, when CIA operatives disguised themselves as a film crew to rescue six American diplomats in Tehran during the Iran hostage crisis, an operation moviegoers will recognize as the plot of \u201cArgo.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018Argo\u2019 was almost too far-fetched to even believe,\u201d said Brent, an in-house historian at CIA headquarters. \u201cIt\u2019s almost more Hollywood than Hollywood.\u201d\nCanadian Caper was both inspired by Hollywood and relied on Hollywood talent. Agent Tony Mendez had been a graphic artist before joining the agency and helping craft the mission.\nAnother key player was John Chambers, the makeup artist who gave the world Spock\u2019s ears on \u201cStar Trek\u201d and won an honorary Oscar for his trailblazing simian work on \u201cPlanet of the Apes.\u201d He was awarded the CIA\u2019s Intelligence Medal of Merit for his work on the covert rescue effort.\nJust a few years before, Howard Hughes, then one of the world\u2019s richest men and a tycoon in media, film and aerospace, agreed to work with the CIA to provide cover for an effort by the agency to lift a sunken Soviet nuclear submarine off the floor of the Pacific Ocean.\nDeploying Hughes\u2019 Glomar Explorer under the guise of mineral extraction, the CIA was able to salvage most of the sub before The Times broke a story blowing its cover \u2014 \u201cthe story that sunk our efforts,\u201d in CIA parlance.\nAnd another mission was made possible thanks to a device invented by a professional photographer \u2014 a gadget that later became the inspiration of an over-the-top scene in the blockbuster Batman film \u201cThe Dark Knight.\u201d\nIn Project Coldfeet, CIA agents gathering intelligence on a Soviet station erected on a precariously drifting sheet of ice in the Arctic needed a reliable extraction plan. But how does one pick up an agent without landing a plane on the ice?\nThe answer was the \u201cskyhook\u201d: Balloons lifted a tether attached to a harness worn by an agent high into the sky. A CIA plane snagged the tether and carried the agent off to safety.\nIn \u201cThe Dark Knight,\u201d Batman makes a dramatic escape deploying the same kind of balloon-harness contraption.\n\u2018The superhero spy\u2019\nCIA leadership often says that acceptance into the agency is harder than getting into Harvard and Yale combined. Yet the agency still has challenges recruiting the type of talent it is looking for \u2014 either in reaching those with unconventional skills, or in convincing them that they should leave secure, comparatively well-paid, comfortable jobs for a secretive life of public service.\nIt is no easy task managing work at the agency, especially with family, CIA officials acknowledged. Deciding if and when to share one\u2019s true identity with their children is a regular struggle. But Janelle said the CIA tells potential recruits there is a middle ground that doesn\u2019t require them to entirely abandon their existing lives.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t have to leave their companies to help their country and to work with CIA,\u201d Janelle said. \u201cPeople come here because they love their country and know they can make a difference.\u201d\nJanelle is part of a team that regularly engages with creatives who want to portray the agency or spies as accurately as possible.\n\u201cSome producers and directors reach out and they do care about accuracy,\u201d Janelle said, \u201cbut they ultimately pick and choose what\u2019s going to work for the film or show.\u201d\nCIA analysts have also been known to leave the agency for opportunities in the entertainment industry, writing books and scripts drawing from their experiences \u2014 so long as they don\u2019t track too closely with those experiences.\nJoe Weisberg, the writer and producer behind the television series \u201cThe Americans,\u201d and McCloskey, who is working on a fifth novel focused on U.S. and British intelligence, were both part of the agency before launching their writing careers. And as CIA alumni, they had to submit their works for review.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole publication and classification-review process,\u201d Brent said.\nThat process can be a bit of a slog, McCloskey said: \u201cThey quite literally redact in black ink.\u201d\nBut it is far more difficult for nonfiction writers than novelists.\n\u201cThere could be bits of tradecraft, or alluding to assets, or people at the agency, which are clear no\u2019s,\u201d McCloskey said. \u201cBut with novels, it\u2019s not that hard to write them in a way to get them through the review board.\u201d\nTry as they may, studios often repeat the same falsehoods about the CIA, no matter how often they are corrected. Officers and agents aren\u2019t the same thing, for one. And as disappointing as it may be for lovers of spy thrillers, the majority of officers are not licensed or trained to carry weapons.\n\u201cOne thing Hollywood often gets wrong is the idea that it\u2019s one officer doing everything, when it\u2019s really a team sport here,\u201d Janelle said.\n\u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d an Oscar-winning film released in 2012 about the hunt for Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, was widely acclaimed but criticized by some within the intelligence community over the credit it lends a single, fictional CIA analyst for tracking him down.\nMcCloskey sympathizes with the writer\u2019s dilemma.\n\u201cI can\u2019t have 35 people on a team. From a storytelling standpoint, it just doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he said, acknowledging that little in the field of espionage is accurately captured on screen, even though there are plenty of former spies available to work as consultants.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no lack of sources to get it right,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s that the superhero spy \u2014 the Jack Ryans and Jason Bournes \u2014 are pretty much the Hollywood representation of espionage.\u201d\nHowever inaccurately glorified and dramatized, the agency hopes that Hollywood\u2019s work can keep the revolving door moving, inspiring atypical talent to join its ranks.\n\u201cWe have architects, carpenters, people who worked in logistics,\u201d Brent said. \u201cPeople might not realize the range of skill sets here at CIA.\u201d\nAnd as Canadian Caper showed, sometimes spycraft requires stagecraft. It\u2019s possible that what\u2019s needed most to complete the next mission won\u2019t be oceanography or data mining, but costume design. Or maybe another ballerina."

      "text": "Putin commends Trump\u2019s \u2018sincere efforts\u2019 to end Ukraine war ahead of Alaska summit\n- Share via\nLONDON \u2014 Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday praised President Trump\u2019s efforts to end the war in Ukraine, more than three years after Moscow launched its invasion, as the two leaders prepared for a pivotal U.S.\u2013Russia summit Friday in Alaska.\nFollowing a meeting Thursday with top government officials on the summit, Putin said in a short video released by the Kremlin that the Trump administration was making \u201cquite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the hostilities\u201d and to \u201creach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved.\u201d\nPutin also suggested that \u201clong-term conditions of peace between our countries, and in Europe, and in the world as a whole,\u201d could be reached under an agreement with the U.S. on nuclear arms control.\nIn Washington, Trump said there was a 25% chance that the summit would fail, but he also floated the idea that, if the meeting succeeds, he could bring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to Alaska for a subsequent, three-way meeting.\nIn a radio interview with Fox News, Trump also said he might be willing to stay in Alaska longer, depending on what happens with Putin.\nMeanwhile, Zelensky and other European leaders worked to ensure their interests are taken into account when Trump and Putin meet in Anchorage.\nUncertainty for Europe\nU.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer welcomed Zelensky to London on Thursday in a show of British support for Ukraine a day before the critical Trump-Putin meeting. The two embraced warmly outside Starmer\u2019s offices at 10 Downing Street without making any comments, and Zelensky departed about an hour later.\nZelensky\u2019s trip to the British capital came a day after he took part in virtual meetings from Berlin with Trump and the leaders of several European countries. Those leaders said that Trump had assured them that he would make a priority of trying to achieve a ceasefire in Ukraine when he meets with Putin.\nSpeaking after the meetings to reporters, Trump warned of \u201cvery severe consequences\u201d for Russia if Putin doesn\u2019t agree to stop the war against Ukraine after Friday\u2019s meeting.\nWhile some European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron, praised Wednesday\u2019s video conference with Trump as constructive, uncertainty remained over how the U.S. leader \u2014 whose rhetoric toward both Zelensky and Putin has evolved dramatically since retaking office this year \u2014 would conduct negotiations in the absence of any other interested parties.\nBoth Zelensky and the Europeans have worried that the bilateral U.S.-Russia summit would leave them and their interests sidelined, and that any conclusions could favor Moscow and leave Ukraine and Europe\u2019s future security in jeopardy.\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov tamped down expectations for any breakthroughs from the Friday summit, saying there were no plans to sign documents and that it would be a \u201cbig mistake\u201d to predict the results of the negotiations, according to Russian news outlet Interfax.\nThe Kremlin on Thursday said the meeting between Trump and Putin would begin at 11:30 a.m. local time. Putin\u2019s foreign policy adviser, Yuri Ushakov, told reporters that Trump and Putin will first sit down for a one-on-one meeting followed by a meeting between the two delegations. Then talks will continue over \u201ca working breakfast.\u201d A joint news conference will follow.\nTrump contradicted the Kremlin, saying that no decisions have been made about holding a news conference with Putin. The uncertainty reflects just how much about the summit, including its schedule, remains unsettled.\nUkraine\u2019s territorial integrity\nStarmer said Wednesday that the Alaska summit could be a path to a ceasefire in Ukraine, but he also alluded to European concerns that Trump may strike a deal that forces Ukraine to cede territory to Russia. He warned that Western allies must be prepared to step up pressure on Russia if necessary.\nDuring a call Wednesday among leaders of countries involved in the \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d \u2014 those who are prepared to help police any future peace agreement between Moscow and Kyiv \u2014 Starmer stressed that any ceasefire deal must protect the \u201cterritorial integrity\u201d of Ukraine.\n\u201cInternational borders cannot be, and must not be changed by force,\u2019\u2019 he said.\nKyiv has long insisted that safeguards against future Russian attacks provided by its Western allies would be a precondition for achieving a durable end to the fighting. Yet many Western governments have been hesitant to commit military personnel.\nCountries in the coalition, which includes France and the U.K., have been trying for months to secure U.S. security backing, should it be required. Following Wednesday\u2019s virtual meetings, Macron said Trump told the assembled leaders that while NATO must not be part of future security guarantees, \u201cthe United States and all the parties involved should take part.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very important clarification that we have received,\u201d Macron said.\nTrump did not reference any U.S. security commitments during his comments to reporters on Wednesday.\nSome Ukrainians are skeptical\nWith another high-level meeting on their country\u2019s future on the horizon, some Ukrainians expressed skepticism about the summit\u2019s prospects.\nOleksandra Kozlova, 39, who works at a digital agency in Kyiv, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that she believes Ukrainians \u201chave already lost hope\u201d that meaningful progress can be made toward ending the war.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this round will be decisive,\u201d she said. \u201cThere have already been enough meetings and negotiations promising us, ordinary people, that something will be resolved, that things will get better, that the war will end. Unfortunately, this has not happened, so personally I don\u2019t see any changes coming.\u201d\nAnton Vyshniak, a car salesman in Kyiv, said Ukraine\u2019s priority now should be saving the lives of its military service members, even at the expense of territorial concessions.\n\u201cAt the moment, the most important thing is to preserve the lives of male and female military personnel. After all, there are not many human resources left,\u201d he said. \u201cBorders are borders, but human lives are priceless.\u201d\nRussia and Ukraine trade strikes\nZelensky said Thursday that Ukraine had secured the release of 84 people from Russian captivity, including both soldiers and civilians. Those freed included people held by Russia since 2014, 2016 and 2017, as well as soldiers who had defended the now Russian-occupied Ukrainian city of Mariupol, Zelensky wrote on Telegram.\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said Thursday that it too had received 84 soldiers as part of a prisoner exchange.\nIn other developments, Russian strikes in Ukraine\u2019s Sumy region overnight Wednesday resulted in numerous injuries, Ukrainian regional officials said. A missile strike on a village in the Seredyna-Budska community wounded a 7-year-old girl and a 27-year-old man, according to regional governor Oleh Hryhorov. The girl was hospitalized in stable condition.\nIn Russia, a Ukrainian drone attack damaged several apartment buildings in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don, near the border with Ukraine, where 13 civilians were wounded, according to acting governor of the region, Yuri Slyusar. Two of the wounded were hospitalized in serious condition, Slyusar said.\nPylas and Spike write for the Associated Press. Spike reported from Budapest, Hungary.

      "text": "Rep. Gephardt Announces Bid for Presidency\n- Share via\nST. LOUIS \u2014 Democratic Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri declared his presidential candidacy Monday, pledging to restore the nation to its past primacy in the world, particularly in international trade.\n\u201cWe are determined to make America first again. First in economic leadership, first in national strength, first in its commitment to the vindication of human rights--and the survival of the human race,\u201d the 46-year-old congressman told a lunch-hour crowd of several thousand at Union Station, a former railroad depot that is now an elaborate shopping plaza here in his hometown.\nThe red-haired, boyish-looking Gephardt is the first Democrat to announce for the 1988 nomination. He is considered a political moderate, although he claims to believe that ideology does not matter as much as finding solutions to problems.\nHe is chairman of the House Democratic caucus and, in his six terms in Congress, has won a reputation among his colleagues as an effective tactician. But Gephardt is little known nationally, and the success of his candidacy may depend on intensive campaigning during the next year.\nIn his announcement address, frequently interrupted by cheers and applause, Gephardt painted a picture of a nation in decline in such areas as trade and technology, and he put most of the blame on what he contended was the lack of leadership of the Reagan Administration.\n\u2018Government Has Failed\u2019\n\u201cOur people haven\u2019t failed; our government has failed the people,\u201d he declared, citing the huge U.S. trade deficit as \u201cthe clearest case\u201d for his argument.\n\u201cThe next President must be as tough in negotiating the terms of trade as this President has been in negotiating with the Russians,\u201d he said.\nSingling out South Korea as an an example, Gephardt said: \u201cWe are supporting a military dictatorship in South Korea that deprives its own people of basic rights--and by its predatory trade practices deprives our people of jobs. We can no longer accept a situation in which they can invade our market with Hyundais sold cheap because we are paying dearly for the tanks that defend their borders.\u201d\n\u2018National Partnership\u2019\nGephardt called also for \u201can unprecedented national commitment\u201d to improving the quality of American education and to modernizing American industry. \u201cWe must set a national goal that no qualified student at any level will be denied the chance to learn because of money,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must form a new national partnership--public and private--to assure that the skills of our people keep pace with the demands of the marketplace.\u201d\nHis administration would seek to make America \u201cfirst not only in GNP, but in concern and compassion,\u201d he said. In a reference to the Iran- contra scandal and the criminal charges of insider trading brought against prominent figures in the securities industry, he said: \u201cFrom the White House to Wall Street, we must get rid of the dangerous idea that the proper standard of conduct is whatever someone can get away with.\u201d\nImmediately after his announcement, Gephardt flew to Des Moines, Iowa, on a campaign swing in the state where the Democratic delegate selection process begins next February.\nGephardt will not have the Democratic field to himself for long. Former Arizona Gov. Bruce Babbitt is scheduled to announce his candidacy next month, to be followed in April by former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart, the acknowledged front runner, and later on by black leader Jesse Jackson. Also expected to enter the race is Delaware Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis is considered to be another possibility.\nCites Leadership Ability\nWhen asked in a preannouncement interview what quality sets him apart from other potential Democratic candidates, Gephardt cited his leadership abilities, as exemplified by his House record.\n\u201cImportant to leadership is having ideas, being able to articulate those ideas and move those ideas into reality,\u201d Gephardt said. \u201cI have done that with tax reform, I have done that with trade, I have done that with health care. I think my record of being able to translate ideas into reality is better than anybody who is going to be in this race.\u201d\nIn a more practical sense, Gephardt is counting on his House colleagues to help him raise money and organize support in their home states. Among the more prominent congressmen from whom Gephardt expects help are House Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley of Washington, House Whip Tony Coelho of Merced, Calif., House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois and House Rules Committee Chairman Claude Pepper of Florida.\nGephardt\u2019s vigorous support of tough legislation aimed at cutting the U.S. trade deficit puts him in a good position to seek assistance from organized labor also.\nPicked Up Voters\u2019 Trash\nOne of Gephardt\u2019s chief assets is his diligence. On one occasion, when then-Alderman Gephardt\u2019s constituents complained about trash collection, Gephardt hired a truck and drove through the St. Louis district making the pickups himself.\nGephardt\u2019s positions on some issues will stir controversy. Anti-abortion forces are likely to voice resentment about his giving up his support for a constitutional amendment banning abortion. Gephardt explains that he opposes federal funding for abortion and is concentrating on finding alternatives to abortion rather than on seeking outright prohibition.\nDefends Harsh Trade Stand\nSome will also object to his trade proposals, contending that they are protectionist. But Gephardt maintains that the threat of harsh steps, such as import quotas, is needed to open foreign markets to U.S. goods.\nGephardt registers in single digits in public opinion polls of possible candidates, but he attributes this to lack of name recognition, a handicap he shares with some of his rivals. Still, Gephardt is not regarded as either an electrifying orator or colorful personality, which will test his ability to develop some special message that can help him widen his support."

      "text": "Is Putin laying a trap in Alaska, or is Trump?\n- Share via\n- Trump is scheduled to host the Russian leader at a U.S. military base in Anchorage on Friday.\n- It is an about-face from Trump, who over much of the summer criticized Putin in harsh terms for the first time.\nANCHORAGE \u2014 The first presidential summit in years between Russia and the United States is on, setting nerves in Europe and Ukraine on a knife\u2019s edge. But President Trump may have a surprise in store for Vladimir Putin.\nEfforts to scuttle the high-stakes meeting have not been subtle. European officials issued statements in recent days on the futility of Trump negotiating with Putin over Ukraine without Ukraine, urging the U.S. president on Wednesday to not cut a unilateral deal. Kyiv warned that Moscow\u2019s proposals for peace \u2014 rewarding its war of conquest with territorial concessions \u2014 are a nonstarter. Many Russia experts are hoping one side simply decides to call it off.\nDespite their efforts, the summit \u2014 haphazardly scheduled on American soil with days to spare \u2014 is moving ahead, with Trump scheduled to host the Russian leader at a U.S. military base in Anchorage on Friday, the first meeting of its kind since 2021.\nExperts fear Putin may be laying a trap for the Americans, manipulating Trump in private to solidify Russia\u2019s position on the battlefield. But Trump suggested Wednesday that he would demand Putin agree to a ceasefire in Alaska.\n\u201cThere will be very severe consequences\u201d if he doesn\u2019t, Trump told reporters.\n\u2018Very grave risk\u2019\nHosting the meeting is an about-face from Trump, who over much of the summer appeared in the throes of a remarkable transformation on Putin, criticizing the Russian leader in harsh terms for the first time. To the relief and delight of Europe, Trump appeared to be losing his patience \u2014 embarrassed, even \u2014 at Putin\u2019s open refusal to heed his calls for a ceasefire in Ukraine.\nBut Trump\u2019s threats of a response, increasing sanctions against Russia and its trading partners, lasted only a matter of days.\nOn Aug. 6, the president\u2019s special envoy on the crisis, Steve Witkoff, a real estate investor with no experience in diplomacy and no background in the region, was dispatched to Moscow. Planning for a summit began within hours of his departure from the Kremlin.\nOn Tuesday, as White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the summit would amount to a \u201clistening session\u201d for Trump on Putin\u2019s interest in peace, battlefield reports emerged of a significant Russian breach in Ukrainian lines.\nIn a phone call, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told Trump that Putin was \u201cbluffing\u201d on his commitments to peace, pressing ahead with an offensive to gain more territory. \u201cThere should be joint pressure on Russia, there should be sanctions \u2014 and there should be a message that if Russia doesn\u2019t agree to a ceasefire in Alaska, this principle should work,\u201d Zelensky said Wednesday.\n\u201cIt sure looks like it\u2019s moving in the wrong direction,\u201d John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security advisor in his first term, told The Times, dismissing Witkoff as a chief culprit behind what he fears is a coming diplomatic crisis: \u201cBetter send the Bobbsey twins.\u201d\nThe perils of this meeting, Bolton said, lie in Putin\u2019s skills as a manipulator. The Russian president may well convince Trump that his designs on Ukraine are reasonable \u2014 and the only way forward.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a very grave risk it does become an almost take-it-or-leave-it proposition for Zelensky,\u201d Bolton said. On Wednesday morning, Trump criticized the media for being \u201cvery unfair\u201d to him for quoting \u201cfired losers and really dumb people like John Bolton.\u201d\nRussia invaded the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea and its eastern regions in 2014, and launched a full-scale invasion of the country in 2022. Nearly a million Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded in pursuit of Vladimir Putin\u2019s war of conquest, according to independent analysts, with hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers adding to the casualty count.\n\u201cClearly, Trump wants to sit down with the guy that he thinks is his friend again,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cAnd from Putin\u2019s point of view, he doesn\u2019t want any pesky Europeans around \u2014 and particularly not Zelensky. He wants to see if he can correct the damage he did.\u201d\nEchoes of Helsinki\nSeven years ago, entering a meeting with his Russian counterpart, Trump set a similar bar for success as Leavitt has this week. \u201cI don\u2019t expect anything,\u201d Trump said in an interview at the time from Scotland, before leaving for Helsinki. \u201cI go in with very low expectations.\u201d\nOn Air Force One en route to Helsinki, he cast himself as a dealmaker and tweeted that, \u201cno matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia,\u201d it would still not be enough to earn him praise. He repeated the turn of phrase Wednesday morning in his post criticizing Bolton.\n\u201cIf I got Moscow and Leningrad free,\u201d Trump wrote, \u201cas part of the deal with Russia, the Fake News would say that I made a bad deal!\u201d\nWhat resulted was a meeting and subsequent news conference that produced one of the most notorious moments of Trump\u2019s first term. On the heels of calling the European Union a \u201cfoe\u201d of the United States, Trump stood beside Putin and took his side over the U.S. intelligence community, disputing its assessment that Russia had interfered in the 2016 presidential election.\nExperts fear that a similar diplomatic rupture could unfold if Trump, deferential to Putin, emerges from their meeting Friday siding with the Russian leader over Ukraine in the war.\nIn recent days, Trump has said that a deal between the two sides would have to include land \u201cswapping\u201d \u2014 territorial concessions that are prohibited by the Ukrainian Constitution without a public vote of support \u2014 and that he would give Zelensky the \u201ccourtesy\u201d of a call after his meeting with Putin, if all goes well.\nTrump\u2019s struggle to get Russia and Ukraine to a negotiating table, let alone to secure a ceasefire, has grown into a fixation for him.\n\u201cThis will be the first U.S.-Russia summit brought about by sheer ignorance and incompetence: The U.S. president and his chosen envoy mistook a Russian demand for a concession,\u201d said Brian Taylor, director of the Moynihan Institute of Global Affairs at Syracuse University.\n\u201cUltimately, this is not a war about this or that piece of territory, but about whether Russia can establish political control over Ukraine, or whether Ukraine will remain free to choose its own domestic and international path,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cTrump\u2019s false suggestion again that Zelensky is somehow at fault for Russia invading Ukraine indicates he still does not understand how we got here or what\u2019s at stake.\u201d\nKonstantin Sonin, a professor at the University of Chicago who has been sentenced in absentia to 8\u00bd years in prison in Russia for publishing information on a Russian massacre of Ukrainian civilians at Bucha, said that Trump\u2019s attempts to negotiate away Ukrainian territory could be diplomatically disastrous \u2014 but will make little difference on the ground.\n\u201cThis is not a very popular view, but I am not sure that the U.S. has that much leverage over President Zelensky to force him into major concessions,\u201d Sonin said. \u201cMany European countries would support Ukraine no matter what \u2014 even at the cost of their relationship with the U.S. With full withdrawal of the U.S. support, the catastrophic scenario, Ukraine will still be able to fight on.\u201d\nPitfalls for both sides\nKremlinologists tend to believe Putin\u2019s training as a KGB officer at the end of the Cold War gave him unique skills to navigate the world stage.\nIn Helsinki \u2014 as he had so often done with other world leaders, including the queen of England and the pope \u2014 Putin kept Trump waiting for half an hour, seen as a move to throw off the U.S. delegation leading up to the meeting.\nLast week, in his meeting with Witkoff, the Russian president offered an Order of Lenin to a CIA official whose son died in Ukraine fighting for Russian forces.\nRussia watchers fear that Friday will be no different. Already, Putin has secured a meeting with the U.S. president on his own terms.\n\u201cWhatever else you think about Putin, he\u2019s an experienced and clever ruler who has successfully manipulated Trump in the past,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cPutin\u2019s intransigence in rejecting Trump\u2019s proposed ceasefire led not to the sanctions that Trump promised to apply last Friday, but an invitation to the United States for a summit at which the U.S. president has already signaled he will endorse territorial changes achieved through military conquest.\u201d\nBut there may also be pitfalls in store for Putin, experts said.\nTrump\u2019s shift in tone on Putin since a NATO summit in The Hague in June suggests it is possible, if unlikely, that Trump is preparing to enter the meeting with a tougher stance. In recent months, the president has seen political benefit in catching world leaders off guard, berating Zelensky and South Africa\u2019s leader in the Oval Office with cameras rolling.\nAt the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit, showered in praise by European leaders, Trump said in unusually clear terms that he was with the alliance \u201call the way.\u201d Days later, he accused Putin of throwing \u201cmeaningless ... bull\u2014\u201d at him and his team over the Ukraine war.\n\u201cI think there is some risk for Putin,\u201d Sonin said. \u201cHe is not comfortable in any kind of adversarial situation \u2014 he quickly gets angry and defensive. And President Trump has the ability to put people in uncomfortable situations publicly. He has never done this to Putin before, but who knows.\u201d\nTo Bolton, the best outcome of the summit would be that Putin fails to persuade Trump that he\u2019s seriously interested in peace.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen, but it\u2019s possible,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cI think in the environment that they\u2019ve got, one on one \u2014 only Russians and Americans present \u2014 that\u2019s ideal for Putin to do his thing.\u201d\n\u201cSo he\u2019s got what he wants,\u201d Bolton added. \u201cHe\u2019s on American soil, with no one else around.\u201d\nWhat else you should be reading\nThe must-read: Schools to open with unprecedented protections for children and their parents amid ICE raids\nThe deep dive: Here are the EVs you can buy for less than $35,000\nThe L.A.

A GREAT DAY FOR JUSTICE IN AMERICA!\u201d\nThe ruling upends the orders of district court and appellate judges who had paused the deportations and said the administration had overstepped its power.\nThe court did not decide a larger issue: whether the administration\u2019s use of the Alien Enemies Act is constitutional.\nThe families of many people deported under the law said they are not gang members. More than 100 men accused of belonging to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua were sent to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador.\nThough the court held that detainees have the right to challenge their removal, immigrant advocates said this comes with a catch: People held for deportation will have to file individual petitions in the district where they are detained, a difficult process for someone arrested in, say, California but held in Texas, far from family and lawyers.\nImmigration officials sent many detainees to Texas before their deportation to El Salvador.\nThe ACLU and other plaintiffs filed emergency lawsuits in New York and Texas federal courts to halt the removals of five Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act. A Texas judge signed a temporary restraining order Wednesday. A New York judge said at a hearing that he would sign a temporary restraining order as well.\nSen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and three other Democratic members of the Senate and House judiciary committees issued a statement Tuesday saying the Supreme Court ruling \u201cwill unquestionably harm people caught up in this oppressive nightmare.\u201d\n\u201cAlthough the Court unanimously agreed that deportations without due process are illegal, the reality is the Trump Administration has been rapidly and erroneously deporting people, and has taken the position that those erroneously deported may be confined to foreign prisons with no redress,\u201d the legislators wrote. \u201cThe Court\u2019s requirement that challenges occur through individual habeas petitions will make it very difficult for people to successfully challenge their removals before they happen.\u201d\nThe Alien Enemies Act was last used during World War II and, according to an overview from the National Archives, was employed to detain more than 31,000 people from Japan, Germany and Italy. Three times as many people of Japanese descent, mostly American citizens, were also held at incarceration camps.\nFormer President Trump says that if reelected, he will initiate the largest mass deportation of undocumented immigrants in history. Experts say that\u2019s unlikely.\nExperts including Tom Jawetz, a former senior attorney at the Homeland Security Department under the Biden administration, are skeptical that immigrants targeted under the wartime law will actually be given enough time to find lawyers and challenge their deportations.\n\u201cWhile the court did provide sort of a mixed win, I think there is very good reason to be concerned that the process afforded to these individuals is going to be lacking,\u201d he said. \u201cWith an administration that shoots first and really doesn\u2019t ask questions ever, I think we\u2019re going to see a lot more mistakes taking place through these kinds of removals.\u201d\nLindsay Toczylowski, co-founder and chief executive of the Los Angeles-based Immigrant Defenders Law Center, represents a gay makeup artist who was seeking asylum when the Trump administration deported him to the Salvadoran prison. Officials cited his crown tattoos as evidence of him being a member of Tren de Aragua.\nToczylowski said the due process review required by the Supreme Court will be a disaster in practice.\n\u201cMost people forcibly sent to El Salvador were unrepresented,\u201d she wrote on X. Referring to their detention in Texas, she added, \u201cTrump purposefully moved them to remote detention centers in TX pre-rendition.\u201d\nOnce these cases begin weaving through the court system and one makes it to the Supreme Court, the public will pretty quickly see what the court really thinks about use of the wartime law, said Gabriel \u201cJack\u201d Chin, a professor who studies the intersection of criminal and immigration law at UC Berkeley.\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried yet,\u201d he said.\nJawetz said many questions remain to be answered by the Supreme Court, among them: What happens to those already deported under the Alien Enemies Act? Can this wartime authority be invoked during a time of peace and against a nongovernmental entity?\nWith the deportation pause lifted, those questions could now work their way through the court system in a much more rushed and chaotic fashion, Jawetz said.\nIn a separate decision Monday, the Supreme Court paused a lower court\u2019s order requiring the Trump administration to return a Maryland man who Trump administration lawyers admitted was wrongly deported to the El Salvador prison.\nTrump officials wrongly sent Maryland man to El Salvador but refuse to bring him back.\nSuch court-ordered returns are somewhat rare but have taken place. The administration has said it has no way to bring back the man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was not deported under the Alien Enemies Act.\nIf the justices decide that the Trump administration cannot be required to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S., \u201cthere\u2019s very limited hope that the courts will step in and say any of these folks who have been sent to rot in the Salvadoran prison have a chance of getting their day in court,\u201d Jawetz said."

      "text": "It is set to be one of the last good summer weekends in Anchorage, Alaska \u2013 the peak of the salmon run and the middle of berry season \u2013 and residents hope that Friday\u2019s summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin isn\u2019t going to ruin it for them.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to taking my boat out on the water at Prince William Sound \u2013 that\u2019s my plan,\u201d said Andy Moderow, who works at a conservation non-profit in Anchorage.\nJeff Landfield, owner of the Alaska Landmine news site, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had a pretty good summer. Getting projects done, going out hunting, fishing, camping, four-wheeling. But it\u2019s coming to the close of the season, so I\u2019ve seen several people say, \u2018They better not fuck up my plans.\u2019\u201d\nThe largest city in Alaska, Anchorage sits farther north than Oslo and St Petersburg. With a population of just under 300,000 people, its low-slung downtown sits on mud flats above the Cook Inlet, at the base of the Chugach mountains. Its neighborhoods sprawl on wide streets between strip malls and stands of birch; its downtown shops sell Alaska Native handicrafts and bear and moose-themed souvenirs.\nResidents refer to the rest of the US as \u201cthe lower 48\u201d, and see themselves as having \u201can independent streak\u201d, said Colleen Heaney-Mead, who runs a daycare in Anchorage.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be part of whatever is happening there,\u201d she said, discussing the Trump administration\u2019s actions in the contiguous US. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do everything they do.\u201d\nFriday\u2019s summit won\u2019t mark the first time the city has been the setting for high-profile diplomacy. China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, stopped off at the city in 2017, dining on king salmon and crab bisque on his way back from a meeting with Trump in Florida.\nTwo years later, Anchorage was the venue for a tense meeting between Chinese diplomats and officials from the Biden government who publicly rebuked each other over human rights abuses and systemic racism.\nBut this time around, things feels different.\nIn Alaska, Russia is not an abstract enemy but a close neighbor; its jets buzz Alaskan airspace, its government is said to be undercutting Alaskan fishermen. Anchorage residents are torn between excitement over a high-profile visit and trepidation over what that visit might mean.\n\u201cYou feel like Anchorage is back on the map in a way, which I think everyone sort of enjoys,\u201d said Hollis French, a retired state senator who served on the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission.\n\u201cAlthough I had dinner last night with two friends, and we\u2019re all sort of pessimistic and skeptical. You know, I would say we\u2019re expecting Trump to do something horrible.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s announcement that he was going to meet Putin \u201cin Russia\u201d also set off alarm bells in a region which was part of the Russian empire until its sale to the US in 1867.\n\u201cThere\u2019s the satirical response that Alaskans have: \u2018Please don\u2019t sell us back,\u2019\u201d said Heaney-Mead.\nModerow, who grew up at the end of the cold war, said fallout shelters and nuclear drills were some of his earliest memories, even if Alaskan politicians, such as the 2008 vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, at times make a bit much of the short distance between the two countries.\n\u201cRussia is a neighbor,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve grown up in the state, you are aware of Russia, and its proximity \u2013 even though Sarah Palin kind of oversold it in her debate.\u201d\nFrench concurred, saying: \u201cWe are aware that they\u2019re a hostile neighbor. We are aware that they probe our defenses and we respond accordingly. I think most people know that the leader of the country is not, you know, the embodiment of the country. But [Putin] certainly got his people cowed. And so I think Alaskans are wary of him.\u201d\nLandfield gestured to longstanding cultural ties between Russia and Alaska, including university exchange programs, and the Old Believers, a sect of the Russian Orthodox church, brought to Alaska by Russians fleeing repression over the years. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like Putin. It\u2019s not Russia or Russians,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Russia is our enemy.\u201d\nMatt Acu\u00f1a Buxton, a longtime political reporter based in Anchorage, said there was \u201ca really broad dissatisfaction\u201d that Putin \u2013 the subject of an international criminal court (ICC) arrest warrant \u2013 is visiting the city.\n\u201cA lot of Alaskans really understand that Putin and Putin\u2019s administration are really not friends of Alaskans,\u201d he said.\nThe White House has signalled that the summit will be held at the military base in north-east Anchorage, a letdown for locals, said Meade, as \u201canything that happens on base isn\u2019t like it really happens in Alaska\u201d.\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped Anchorage residents from offering other ideas: 49% of respondents to a poll from the Alaska Landmine suggested the two world leaders could meet \u201cat Sarah Palin\u2019s house\u201d.\nAnother Anchorage newsletter, the Alaska Memo, proposed that Trump and Putin could hike Flattop mountain, the \u201cquintessential Anchorage-area date night\u201d, or stay at Skinny Dick\u2019s Halfway Inn on the road to Fairbanks.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a meme-rich environment right now,\u201d said Landfield.\nAcu\u00f1a Buxton, who writes the Alaska Memo, said such satire offers Alaskans a way of coping with the \u201cdystopian\u201d and improbable scenario of Trump trading Alaska to Russia.\n\u201cUltimately, in the big picture of things, this is about Ukraine,\u201d he said of the Trump-Putin meeting. \u201c[But] I think for Alaskans, it\u2019s just sort of like a chance to roll our eyes a little bit and make some jokes.\u201d"
