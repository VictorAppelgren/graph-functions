      "feedback": "Strong starting scaffold for a 3–6 month horizon, with a plausible catalysts map and timing windows, but to reach world‑class quality you should: (1) tighten the causal chain and keep it tightly anchored to core auto/EV policy/flows rather than broad political narrative; link each trigger to a specific market transmission (pricing, demand mix, capex decisions, or production shifts) and attach a concrete timing spine (0–2 months, 2–4 months, 4–6 months) with 1–2 quantitative anchors per link; (2) prune non‑core sources and fix misattributions (e.g., HeartSciences/Barista FIRE content is tangential to auto/EV policy); anchor allferences to the auto/EV‑relevant sources: WTNT85IPR (Cadillac Elevated Velocity; GM $4B U.S. manufacturing spend), EPJYXB7DX (Trump tariff plan and “big, beautiful bill” dynamics; dealer AI use), and the GM capacity/plant detail in Source 4; keep Pacaso/Range/Range‑AI signals only if you clearly map them as cross‑asset pivots (wealth/real‑assets channels) rather than core auto drivers. (3) add explicit base‑case and 1–2 alt scenarios with cautious probability ranges (e.g., base: tariff stalemate or gradual pass‑through with continued U.S. EV capacity ramp; alt A: tariff escalation accelerates pricing/demand shifts; alt B: tariff relief or policy pivot dampens the impulse) and clearly define invalidation signals (tariff reversal, policy derailment, or GM/U.S. capacity delays). (4) quantify where possible with the numbers in the sources: tariff at 25% on imported vehicles and parts; GM capex “$10–$12B through 2027” and the $4B/tonawaress; Cadillac Elevated Velocity specs as signaling a future product cadence; Deutsche Bank’s forecast of robust April–May sales ahead of tariff effects; GM’s Orion/Spring Hill production timelines; Pacaso/RANGE‑style platforms as parallel growth streams with stated metrics (21% YoY growth in co‑ownership, 18–19% cash/EBITDA style gains, Range’s 0% AUM or AI‑assisted planning); (5) articulate the macro/policy transmission using first‑principles (tariffs alter marginal cost and pricing power; deficits/Tax/Medicaid signals affect growth and rate expectations; AI tools compress price discovery and channel risk in retail); (6) present a clean, reader‑friendly scenario map with a one‑paragraph base case plus bullet‑sized alt notes (kept compact but scorable), then a short watch‑list and a concise confidence assessment; (7) improve citation discipline by placing source IDs after each sentence that relies on them and avoid mixing multiple, loosely related topics in a single claim; (8) ensure consistency in the forecast envelope by tying every claimed trigger to a concrete source datum (e.g., “25% tariff” [EPJYXB7DX], “GM capex 10–12B” [Source 4], “Cadillac Elevated Velocity specs” [WTNT85IPR], “AI dealer pricing/lead flow roughly +” metric where cited [EPJYXB7DX]); (9) replace the mixed auto/AI/real‑estate/ FIRE threads with a succinct, three‑stream framing (auto/EV policy, AI/retail channels, and cross‑asset growth via wealth platforms) so the transmission channels don’t blur; and (10) end with a crisp, quantified base case, 1–2 plausible alts, explicit risks (tariff shocks, policy reversals, demand derailment, supply constraints), watch‑list signals (tariff developments, GM capacity milestones, AI adoption metrics in auto retail, Pacaso/Range funding rounds), and a calibrated confidence tag. In short: prune to three core sources, sharpen the causal chain with 0–2, 2–4, 4–6 month milestones, add concrete, sourced numbers to every link, and lay out a tight base/alt/risks/watch list with clear invalidation criteria.",
