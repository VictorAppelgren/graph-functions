  "description": "The South Carolina Attorney General's Office argues Alex Murdaugh was convicted on overwhelming evidence, not clerk's comments, in response to appeal challenging double murder convictions.",
  "content": "The South Carolina Attorney General's Office has officially submitted its response to Alex Murdaugh\u2019s appeal challenging his convictions for the murders of his wife and son.\n\nIn a 182-page brief filed before the Aug. 8 deadline, Attorney General Alan Wilson\u2019s office dismantles Murdaugh\u2019s December appeal, which claims that Colleton County Clerk of Court Becky Hill swayed jurors to boost sales of her forthcoming book.\n\nThe filing is the State\u2019s first full rebuttal to Murdaugh\u2019s bid for a new trial.\n\nIn the filing, obtained by Greenville News, prosecutors argued that the jury found Murdaugh guilty based on the \"overwhelming\" evidence, not because of Hill\u2019s brief and \"foolish\" comments about his testimony.\n\nNEW TEXT MESSAGES FUEL ALEX MURDAUGH'S PUSH FOR NEW TRIAL\n\nProsecutors also said Murdaugh forfeited the right to challenge the financial crimes evidence by not appealing the trial court\u2019s decision to admit it.\n\nWilson\u2019s team had initially requested more time to reply, citing the complexity and size of the case, including a 6,000-page trial transcript and significant evidence that needed review.\n\nDick Harpootlian, a Columbia attorney and former state senator who led Murdaugh\u2019s defense, previously told Fox News Digital that Hill\u2019s conduct compromised the trial. According to Harpootlian, Hill's actions potentially cost Murdaugh a fair verdict.\n\nBUSTER MURDAUGH SCORES LEGAL WIN IN DEFAMATION FIGHT OVER DOCUMENTARY\u2019S MURDER IMPLICATIONS: FORMER STATE AG\n\n\"If she had left the jury alone, clearly the worst we would have done was a mistrial,\" Harpootlian said, adding that two jurors would have voted differently if not for Hill\u2019s influence.\n\nThe defense also disputed that the jury should not have heard evidence related to Murdaugh\u2019s financial misconduct.\n\nALEX MURDAUGH TRIAL: EXPERTS WEIGH IN ON POSSIBILITY OF AN OVERTURNED MURDER CONVICTION\n\nThe disgraced attorney was convicted in March 2023 of the murders of his wife, Maggie, and son, Paul, who were fatally shot on June 7, 2021, at the family\u2019s hunting property in Colleton County. He was also found guilty of two weapons charges related to the killings.\n\nMurdaugh\u2019s team has 30 days to answer the attorney general\u2019s brief. Once both sides finish, the state Supreme Court will set oral arguments, likely later this fall, with a decision expected next spring.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMurdaugh, 56, who continues to maintain his innocence, is serving two consecutive life terms in state prison.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Wilson's office, but did not receive a response.\n\nFox News Digital's Sarah Rumpf-Whitten and Peter D'Abrsosca contributed to this report.\n\nStepheny Price is a writer for Fox News Digital and Fox Business.

      "text": "Alex Murdaugh's surviving son, Buster Murdaugh, was granted a \"victory\" this week when a federal judge decided to allow his defamation suit against CNN parent company Warner Bros. to proceed, former South Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon told Fox News Digital.\nCourt documents filed in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina on June 9 detail Judge Richard Mark Gergel's order denying Warner Bros' and Blackfin Inc.'s motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which alleges that the media conglomerates \"insinuated and implied\" in their respective Murdaugh documentary that Buster, now 28, \"had murdered a 19-year-old Hampton County man named Stephen Smith.\"\nSmith \u2014 Buster's former classmate \u2014 was found dead on a rural road in Hampton County, where the Murdaugh family is from, in the summer of 2015.\nAn autopsy later determined that he had been fatally struck by a vehicle in a hit-and-run while he was walking along the run after running out of gas.\nALEX MURDAUGH TRIAL: EXPERTS WEIGH IN ON POSSIBILITY OF AN OVERTURNED MURDER CONVICTION\n\"[T]here were rumors \u2026 Buster Murdaugh was somehow involved in his death, and the basis of the lawsuit is that these media companies \u2014 the main claim being something called defamation by implication \u2014 that they would take interviews of people living in that area that would, in effect, repeat these rumors about Buster Murdaugh being involved in this murder,\" Condon said. \"And the lawsuit claims that they just simply aired these interviews of rumors \u2026 and would juxtapose those interviews with actual law enforcement documents and related information.\"\n\"I do think that [Buster's] reputation has been severely damaged by the reporting that went on.\"\nThe defamation suit alleges that Warner Bros and Blackfin, which produced the Warner Bros documentary, implicated Buster in Smith's death. The media companies tried early on to dismiss it. Fox News Digital has reached out to attorneys for both media companies.\nMURDAUGH COURT CLERK BECKY HILL RELEASED ON BOND AFTER ARREST ON PERJURY, MISCONDUCT CHARGES\nBuster is arguing that statements regarding Smith's death made in the documentary about his father's crimes \"are defamatory and falsely accuse the Plaintiff of committing a crime or moral turpitude,\" an amended complaint states.\n\"The claims have been published to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of viewers who watched the show, including viewers in South Carolina, and the defamatory statements continue to be republished as of the filing of this action on a broad array of streaming platforms and channels owned by Defendant Warner Bros.\"\nWarner Bros and Blackfin filed a motion to dismiss on multiple grounds, including the First Amendment, court filings show.\n\"Plaintiff\u2019s Amended Complaint necessitates dismissal for multiple independent reasons. Plaintiff fails to sufficiently identify the allegedly defamatory content, as the Rules require. \u2026 Leaving aside the lack of requisite specificity, the First Amendment bars Plaintiff\u2019s claims as to the Blackfin Documentary because it does not state as a fact that he is \u2018the murderer of Stephen Smith\u2019 (which is the only alleged defamation),\" attorneys for the two media companies said in their motion to dismiss, among other reasons to dismiss.\nFOLLOW THE FOX TRUE CRIME TEAM ON X\nInvestigators began probing possible links between Smith's death and the Murdaugh family after Buster's mother and brother were both shot to death just miles from the clan's South Carolina estate in June 2021 but did not find any kind of link between the Murdaughs and Smith's death.\nALEX MURDAUGH'S SURVIVING SON, BUSTER MURDAUGH, GETS MARRIED IN LAVISH LOWCOUNTRY WEDDING\nGergel ultimately sided with Buster.\n\"Here, the Court need not decide at this stage which state\u2019s privilege law applies because Plaintiff\u2019s theory of liability does not rest solely on the reporting or republication of law enforcement reports. Rather, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants\u2019 selective juxtaposition of law enforcement interviews with interviews of individuals within Hampton County and reports regarding the Murdaugh family, in tandem, create the defamatory implication that Plaintiff is responsible for Stephen Smith\u2019s death,\" the judge wrote in his order. \"The Court finds that the fair report privilege does not bar Plaintiff\u2019s lawsuit.\"\nREAD THE OTHE ORDER:\nALEX MURDAUGH'S SURVIVING SON, BUSTER MURDAUGH, GETS MARRIED IN LAVISH LOWCOUNTRY WEDDING\nCondon called the decision \"a real victory for Buster Murdaugh and his legal team that they were able to keep the case alive.\"\n\"A real victory for Buster Murdaugh and his legal team.\"\n\"We'll see where it goes with discovery,\" he said. \u2026I was at the Murdaugh trial for every day for six weeks, and I must say, after that case ended and when these different media companies had different stories circulating about the case and related matters, including the Stephen Smith murder, I wouldn't know just personally. There were numbers of people that would routinely ask me about Buster Murdaugh being investigated for the murder of Stephen Smith. They would speculate that he's going to be arrested soon.\"\nSIGN UP TO GET THE TRUE CRIME NEWSLETTER\nCondon added that the fact that the suit \"survived this early stage \u2026 is really significant in terms of where this case might head.\"\n\"I do know Judge Gergel would apply the law very rigorously, and the fact that he's letting these cases go forward tells me that, again, at this very early stage, these cases appear to have merit.\" Condon said.\nGET REAL-TIME UPDATES DIRECTLY ON THE TRUE CRIME HUB\nThe South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) opened a homicide investigation into Smith's death June 23, 2021 \u2014 about two weeks after Alex Murdaugh fatally shot his wife Maggie, 52, and his son, Paul, 22.\nAlex Murdaugh was convicted in Maggie and Paul's murders in March 2023 and was sentenced to life in prison. The disgraced South Carolina legal scion also pleaded guilty to dozens of financial crimes tied to his family's personal injury law firm.\nALLEGED ACCOMPLICE ACCUSED OF HELPING DISGRACED LAWYER ALEX MURDAUGH ENTERS PLEA DEAL\nProsecutors said Alex murdered his wife and youngest son to distract from his financial crimes. The now-56-year-old took in clients who had suffered injuries in various accidents and helped them get millions of dollars in damages, most of which he would keep for himself without telling the victims.\nSmith's mother wrote a letter to the FBI in 2016 implicating the Murdaughs in her son's death, explaining her belief that the Murdaugh family staged the accident in an effort to steal more money.\n\"The first call my family received after the murder was from authorities notifying us of Stephen's death,\" she wrote at the time. \"The second came very quickly the same morning from Solicitor Randolph Murdaugh.\"\nThe retired solicitor, who had served as the region's top prosecutor before retiring in 2005, is the late father of Alex Murdaugh.\nHe allegedly told Smith's mother he was willing to work pro bono as a liaison between the family and investigators but soon stopped returning their calls, the letter says. An attorney for the Smith family did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nBuster issued a statement in 2023 through his attorney denying any role in Smith's death: \"These baseless rumors of my involvement in Stephen's death are false,\" he said. \"My heart goes out to the Smith family.\"\nFox News Digital reached out to Buster's attorneys for comment regarding Gergel's order this week."

      "text": "State responds to Alex Murdaugh's appeal of double murder conviction: 'Obviously guilty'\n- The South Carolina Attorney General's Office filed a 164-page response to Alex Murdaugh's appeal, arguing his murder convictions should stand.\n- The state's filing details Murdaugh's financial crimes and argues they motivated the murders of his wife and son.\n- Murdaugh's defense claims jury tampering and disputes the admissibility of financial crime evidence.\nThe State of South Carolina has responded to convicted murderer Alex Murdaugh's appeal to the South Carolina Supreme Court with an abundance of legal arguments and case precedents that refer to cases as high as United States Supreme Court rulings, arguing that a Colleton County jury convicted Murdaugh \"because he was obviously guilty.\"\nUsing almost every moment of its 120-day extension to respond to Murdaugh's appeal \u2014 the filing came in close to midnight on the August 8 deadline \u2014 the South Carolina Attorney General's Office lays out the Murdaugh criminal case and its arguments as to why Murdaugh is truly guilty of murdering his wife, Maggie, and younger son, Paul, in June of 2021, and why his convictions and twin life sentences should stand, in a 164-page argument.\nCiting more than 100 South Carolina trial precedents and roughly 50 federal case precedents, the AG's Office explains the legal issues and questions raised by Murdaugh's defense and lays out several arguments opposing Murdaugh's request for his guilty verdicts to be vacated and for a new trial.\nIn an extensive narrative that almost reads like a nonfiction novel, prosecutors outline several key moments in the decade-long, financial crime spree that Murdaugh pleaded guilty to, the circumstances surrounding the Murdaugh family murders, and extensive highlights of Murdaugh's internationally publicized, six-week murder trial in Walterboro, that resulted in the March 2023 guilty verdicts, citing more than 500 exhibits of prosecutorial evidence.\nThe state's filing paints a picture of Murdaugh, described as a successful lawyer from a legacy family with a \"big reputation,\" but who was facing massive debt and pending personal lawsuits, then outlines his criminal acts and fall from grace, which eventually led to murder.\nBut while Murdaugh has admitted to stealing millions from law partners and clients, he steadfastly denied murdering his family, and his attorneys have appealed his case to the State Supreme Court based on allegations of jury tampering by former Colleton County Clerk of Court Becky Hill, and numerous disputed issues raised during and after his trial.\nHere are the issues and questions raised by Murdaugh's legal defense team, followed by the state prosecutor's arguments:\nWhat are legal issues raised in Alex Murdaugh's murder conviction appeal?\nIn filing Murdaugh's appeal, a legal team led by Richard Harpootlian and Jim Griffin outlined several reasons they feel their client did not get a fair trial, including:\n- \u201cIs prejudice to the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial presumed when a state official secretly advocates for a guilty verdict in the jury room during a criminal trial?\u201d\n- \u201cIs prejudice to a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial proven when it is found that a state official tampered with the jury and a juror testifies that the jury tampering influenced her verdict?\u201d\n- \u201cDid the trial court err by allowing cumulative and unfairly prejudicial evidence of financial crimes to be presented for over a week, purportedly as evidence of motive?\n- \u201cDid the trial court err in concluding that the Defendant 'opened the door' to evidence of financial crimes by questioning a witness about the Defendant\u2019s relationship with his wife and son?\u201d\n- \u201cDid the Defendant waive his right to object to the introduction of evidence of financial crimes by testifying?\u201d\n- \u201cDid the trial court err by allowing the State to impeach the Defendant with his post-Miranda silence?\u201d\n- \u201cDid the trial court err by allowing a witness qualified as an expert in extracting data from cell phones to testify about an experiment he conducted during trial in which he sat alone in his office over a weekend throwing a phone on the floor to see if the screen would come on, when he collected no data regarding the results of the experiment, admitted he had no expertise regarding that aspect of the phone\u2019s operation, and admitted the results he reported from memory were not statistically significant?\u201d\n- \u201cDid the trial court err by allowing the State to distract from its failure to recover a murder weapon by allowing a State firearms examiner to offer an expert opinion based on a discredited toolmark methodology and by allowing the admission of multiple firearms into evidence that were not connected to the murders as well as a raincoat coated with gunshot residue that was not connected to the defendant?\u201d\n- \u201cDid the trial court\u2019s cumulative evidentiary errors prejudice the Defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial?\u201d\nSouth Carolina\u2019s counterstatements on issues of appeal\nIn response to these questions, SCAG prosecutors raise the following counter questions:\n- Should Justice Toal\u2019s order denying Appellant\u2019s post-trial motion for a new trial be affirmed when the record supports Justice Toal\u2019s finding that the verdict was solely the product of the jury\u2019s honest deliberations and reflected the overwhelming evidence of Appellant\u2019s guilt?\n- Did Appellant waive his objection to the financial crime evidence by failing to appeal all the grounds upon which the trial judge\u2019s ruling admitting it was based? Furthermore, did the trial judge abuse his broad discretion by admitting the financial crime evidence pursuant to Rule 404(b) and Rule 403?\n- Is Appellant entitled to any relief considering the trial judge not only did not abuse his discretion by finding that defense counsel had opened the door to redirect questions to test Will Loving\u2019s knowledge for assertions during cross-examination regarding Appellant\u2019s general character and motive for killing his wife and son, but also finding, as an alternate basis for overruling the objection that defense counsel failed to assert any legal ground for the objection\u2014an alternative ruling Appellant does not challenge on appeal?\n- Is Appellant\u2019s attempt to assert a non-waiver of the financial crime issue in this appeal contesting only the Rule 404(b) ruling of any consequence?\n- Did the trial judge abuse his discretion in overruling Appellant\u2019s objection to the State\u2019s invited cross-examination of Appellant on his failure to correct what he admitted during his own trial testimony had been multiple false statements to law enforcement, family, and friends, indicating that he had not been at the kennels minutes before the double murder occurred?\n- Did Appellant waive his issue with the State\u2019s expert testimony about an out-of-court experiment involving an iPhone by failing to raise a timely contemporaneous objection when it was first admitted and by failing to appeal the trial judge\u2019s finding that defense counsel\u2019s objection was late? Furthermore, did the trial judge abuse his discretion by permitting the State\u2019s expert to testify about the results of the out-of-court experiment he conducted in response to an in-court experiment performed by a defense expert?\n- Did the trial court abuse its discretion in admitting into evidence: (1) opinion evidence from a qualified firearms expert after application of long-accepted analysis methodology; (2) guns seized from Appellant and/or his home consistent in type and caliber to the weapons used in the murders; and (3) a rain jacket seized from Appellant\u2019s parents\u2019 home connected to Appellant which also tested positive for GSR?\n- Did Appellant abandon his cumulative error issue when he failed to offer any argument on the issue in the briefing? Furthermore, was the cumulative error issue procedurally barred since Appellant did not preserve an argument that a specific combination of purported errors, otherwise insignificant when viewed alone, denied him a fair trial?\nWhat are the state prosecutor's arguments against Murdaugh?\nThe primary points of the state's 164-page legal filing Friday make the following arguments:\n- The jury convicted Appellant because he was obviously guilty, not because three jurors heard Becky Hill\u2019s \u201cfoolish and fleeting\u201d comments about his upcoming testimony.\n- By failing to appeal all the grounds upon which the trial judge\u2019s ruling admitting the financial crime evidence was based, Appellant waived his objection to that evidence. Furthermore, the trial judge did not abuse his broad discretion by admitting the financial crime evidence pursuant to Rule 404(b) and Rule 403.\n- Appellant is not entitled to any relief considering the trial judge not only did not abuse his discretion by finding that defense counsel had opened the door to redirect questions to test Will Loving\u2019s knowledge for assertions during cross-examination regarding Appellant\u2019s general character and motive for killing his wife and son, but also finding, as an alternate basis for overruling the objection that defense counsel failed to assert any legal ground for the objection\u2014an alternative ruling Appellant does not challenge on appeal.\n- The trial judge admitted evidence of Appellant\u2019s financial crimes under res gestae and alternatively under Rule 404(b) during the State\u2019s case in chief after a detailed in camera review and consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments. Appellant\u2019s later testimony admitting the financial crimes merely confirmed the already evident and uncontested clear and convincing finding under the alternative Rule 404(b) analysis and is harmlessly cumulative to the similar admissions presented through witnesses Crosby and Wilson, and a confession of judgment. Appellant\u2019s attempt to assert a non-waiver of the financial crime issue in this appeal, contesting only the Rule 404(b) ruling, is of no consequence.\n- The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in overruling Appellant\u2019s objection to the State\u2019s cross-examination of Appellant on his failure to correct what he admitted during his own trial testimony had been multiple false statements to law enforcement, family, and friends, indicating that he had not been at the kennels minutes before the double murder occurred. Not only had various witnesses already testified that ii Appellant had given the same false story that he had not been at the kennels, the defense had throughout the trial elicited testimony suggesting that Appellant had fully cooperated with law enforcement, and, in admitting his false statement in his testimony, Appellant asserted that he had been denied the opportunity to correct his statements by the prosecution. As such, Appellant invited the cross-examination.\n- Appellant waived his issue with the State\u2019s rebuttal expert testimony about an out-of-court experiment involving an iPhone by failing to raise a timely contemporaneous objection when the testimony was first admitted and by failing to appeal the trial judge\u2019s finding that defense counsel\u2019s objection was late. Furthermore, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion by permitting the State\u2019s rebuttal expert to testify about the results of the out-of-court experiment he conducted in response to an in-court experiment performed by a similarly qualified defense expert.\n- The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting into evidence: (1) opinion evidence from a qualified firearms expert after application of long-accepted analysis methodology; (2) guns seized from Appellant and/or his home consistent in type and caliber to the weapons used in the murders; and (3) a rain jacket seized from Appellant\u2019s parents\u2019 home connected to Appellant which also tested positive for GSR. The trial court applied the appropriate tests for admissibility, and its findings of fact for the purpose of admissibility are well-supported in the record. Appellant\u2019s argument to the contrary fails.\n- Appellant has abandoned his cumulative error issue as he failed to offer any argument on the issue in the briefing. Even so, such an issue would be procedurally barred as Appellant did not preserve an argument that a specific combination of purported errors, otherwise insignificant when viewed alone, denied him a fair trial.\nWhat are the next steps in the appeal process?\nSCAG Spokesperson Robert Kittle outlined the next legal steps once the AG's office files its response:\n- After the response brief is filed, the appellant, Murdaugh, will have 10 days to file a reply brief, unless they, too, seek extensions.\n- Once Murdaugh's reply brief is filed, his legal team will have 30 days to prepare the \"record on appeal.\" In a Supreme Court appeal, the record on appeal is a compilation of all the essential documents, exhibits, and transcripts from the lower court trial that are relevant to the appeal and will serve as the factual basis upon which the Supreme Court will review the lower court's decision.\n- Once this step is completed, the parties each have 20 days to put together their final briefs.\n- At that point, the case is \"ripe for consideration by the Court,\" said Kittle, at which time the high court may or may not schedule oral arguments.\n- It is unclear if the Supreme Court will consider the case in late 2025 or sometime in 2026."

      "text": "Experts disagree on whether Alex Murdaugh will get a murder trial do-over after former Colleton County, South Carolina, court clerk Becky Hill was charged with several felonies on Wednesday in two counties.\n\"The [suggestion] that Becky Hill is now in legal trouble helps Alex Murdaugh \u2014 I strongly disagree with that,\" former South Carolina Attorney General Charlie Condon told Fox News Digital. \"I think the exact opposite is really true.\"\nThe South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) on Wednesday afternoon announced that Hill, 57, has been charged with obstructing justice and misconduct in Colleton County and perjury in Richland County. The perjury charge stems from a lie she allegedly told South Carolina Supreme Court Justice Toal in January 2024, when the justice ruled that a new trial was not necessary for Murdaugh upon his appeal.\nCharging documents state that when Toal asked Hill, \"Did you allow anyone from the press to view sealed exhibits?\" Hill responded, \"No, ma'am,\" which is apparently inconsistent with evidence obtained by authorities. They also accuse her of showing sealed photos to a reporter and using her official position as Colleton County clerk for financial gain, specifically by promoting her book about the Murdaugh case on social media.\nMURDAUGH COURT CLERK BECKY HILL RELEASED ON BOND AFTER ARREST ON PERJURY, MISCONDUCT CHARGES\nA Colleton County jury in 2023 convicted Murduagh in the June 2021 murders of his wife, Maggie, and son, Paul, on his family hunting estate. The disgraced personal injury lawyer, whose family had a stronghold on the justice system in neighboring Hampton County for about a century, had requested the new hearing based on allegations of jury tampering surrounding Hill, which Murdaugh's defense team had argued warranted a new trial.\nSLED's charging documents filed Wednesday, however, do not accuse Hill of jury tampering. Fox News Digital has reached out to Hill's attorney, Will Lewis, for comment.\nFORMER SOUTH CAROLINA CLERK IN MURDAUGH MURDER TRIAL ARRESTED ON MULTIPLE FELONIES IN 2 COUNTIES\nCondon said he was \"surprised by the charges\" against Hill \"and that they did not include jury tampering.\"\n\"That had been\u2026 the focus at the hearing for the retrial. Nothing in [Hill's charges] about jury tampering,\" he said. \"To my mind, it's a really big win for the state and a big loss for the defense because a main ground of their appeal would be this jury tampering, and the fact that there are no charges against former clerk Hill for jury tampering tells me that the authorities looked at that and did not believe there was sufficient evidence to show that she tampered with the jury.\"\nSOUTH CAROLINA JUDGE DENIES ALEX MURDAUGH'S REQUEST FOR A NEW MURDER TRIAL\nMeanwhile, attorney Eric Bland of Bland Richter LLP, who represented multiple jurors in Murdaugh's murder trial and several victims of his financial crimes, told Fox News Digital that \"the optics\" of Hill's charges \"bode well for Alex Murdaugh.\"\n\"Three of those charges that are pending in Colleton County really have nothing to do with the trial. [Those are] actions that she took outside of that trial in the course and scope of her duties, taking advantage of her office \u2014 obstruction activity. That has nothing to do with it,\" Bland explained. \"One charge in Richland County is a perjury charge. And it's perjury that does stem from the [January 2024] hearing where Justice Toal rendered a decision not giving a new trial to Alex Murdaugh.\"\nBland noted that Toal said during the 2024 hearing that she did not find Hill's testimony entirely credible and did not take it into consideration when ruling against a retrial.\n\"At the end of the day, this is going to be a legal decision on appeal,\" Bland said. \"Was Justice Toal correct in applying the South Carolina standard on juror interference by an official? And that, as the South Carolina standard says, you not only have to show the juror interference, but you have to show the effect that it had on the jurors and their verdict. I represented six of those jurors. Eleven of those jurors said\u2026 anything that Becky Hill said didn't have any effect on our verdict.\"\nOf 12 total jurors who found Murdaugh guilty in 2023, 11 said Hill did not influence their decisions. One said he heard the clerk make comments about watching Murdaugh's body language but said her words did not influence his verdict.\nEven if Murdaugh were to get his sentenced reversed and a retrial, he would still be serving the rest of his life in prison for his financial crimes, defrauding his law clients out of millions of dollars, Bland noted.\nWATCH: REBECCA HILL ON THE MURDAUGH VERDICT:\nBoth Condon and Bland said Hill presented herself in a professional manner over the course of Murdaugh's murder trial, including one of the first days when a bomb threat shut down the entire courthouse and everyone inside had to evacuate.\n\"She was very warm and engaging, and don't forget\u2026 she touches every aspect of the trial,\" Bland said. \"She is in charge of the court personnel, the bailiffs. She's in charge of the clerk of court's office, where all the filings for the case go, and marshaling all the evidence. She's in charge of the jurors and making sure that they get there on time and they're comfortable and they have something to eat. She participates in all the meetings with the judge and the defense attorneys. So, she's privy to everything. And I think it just got to her head.\"\nWATCH: Becky Hill is asked whether she tampered with the jury\nCondon similarly said the Colleton County courthouse is located in the small town of Walterboro, which does not often see high-profile criminal trials like the Murdaugh case.\n\"She probably was trying to be accommodating,\" Condon said of the charges accusing her of sharing sealed photos with a reporter. \"She's a really nice lady, probably trying to help somebody with their story. And again, I don't think there was a malicious intent with that whatsoever. Having said that... one would expect a clerk of court under these heightened circumstances to follow each and every rule, and the allegations show that she did not. But I don't think it was done with any evil intention.\"\nDick Harpootlian and Jim Griffin, Murdaugh's defense attorneys, told Fox News Digital in a Wednesday statement that while the charges against Hill \"are serious, they are not surprising.\"\nWATCH: ALEX MURDAUGH ATTORNEY DICK HARPOOTLIAN REACTS TO HILL'S ARREST\n\"We have long raised our concerns about her conduct during and after the trial and this arrest further underscores the need to protect the integrity of the judicial process. Every defendant is entitled to a fair and impartial trial and we look forward to Alex Murdaugh finally getting that fair treatment,\" the attorneys said.\nHarpootlian told Fox News on Wednesday that he believes the charges against Hill will result in a new trial for Murdaugh.\nHill was also previously accused of sending herself nearly $10,000 in federal bonuses in the form of child support payments, according to a notice of hearing. She used federal funds to give food and gifts to court employees, including \"Easter Goodies,\" Mother's and Father's Day gifts, and Valentine's Day gifts; paint supplies; flowers and decor; various meals for herself; office furniture; and dog food, dog bones and a dog bed, among other items.\nSLED charging documents make note of the bonus payments.\nSIGN UP TO GET THE TRUE CRIME NEWSLETTER\nThe former court clerk, who held her position for about four years, resigned in March following allegations of jury tampering in the Murdaugh trial but maintained that her decision to leave office was not the result of her conduct during the double murder trial.\n\"Another significant impact in our clerk's office was in 2023, when we had to manage one of the biggest trials in South Carolina history. Our small town came together and made everyone proud,\" Hill said during a news conference at the time to announce her resignation. \"Managing a trial with such importance to the people of South Carolina, as well as to the national and international media interest and public scrutiny, has caused me to reflect upon decisions involving my stay in the office of the clerk of court.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nShe added that her decision not to seek re-election in 2024 would allow her to \"focus on being a wife, a mother and a grandmother,\" and that she wanted to provide \"ample time to other Republican candidates\" interested in the position of Colleton County court clerk.\nGET REAL-TIME UPDATES DIRECTLY ON THE TRUE CRIME HUB\nHer former attorney, Justin Bamberg, who has represented victims of Murdaugh's financial crimes, said at a March news conference that Hill's decision had nothing to do with any pending investigations involving the clerk."

      "text": "Newly uncovered text messages between disgraced former attorney Alex Murdaugh and his alleged drug dealer could have dramatically altered the defense\u2019s trial strategy and possibly prevented a conviction, according to lead defense attorney Dick Harpootlian.\nHarpootlian, a veteran South Carolina defense attorney and former state senator, told Fox News Digital that the texts between Murdaugh and Curtis \"Eddie\" Smith, revealed recently by FITSNews, were not provided to the defense during the trial. Their absence, he said, may have contributed to a key decision not to call Smith to the stand.\n\"One of the big decisions in any trial like this is who you call as witnesses,\" Harpootlian explained. \"We were not aware of these texts. Had we been, it may have made a difference in our decision. These messages offer new insight into the timeline of drug distributions, some of them happening the very week of the murders.\"\nSmith, alleged to have been Murdaugh\u2019s primary drug supplier, has not been prosecuted, despite what Harpootlian described as evidence suggesting he may have been one of the largest OxyContin distributors in the Palmetto state.\n\"Everybody else who was indicted pleaded guilty \u2014 except Eddie Smith,\" he said.\nThe text messages show that Smith and Murdaugh conversed in the days leading up to Murdaugh's murder of his wife Maggie and his youngest son, Paul, on June 7, 2021, on their family's hunting estate in Colleton County, South Carolina.\n\"Hey Brother i need to come get the chech (sic) you got one with you or are you going to be around later,\" Smith texted Murdaugh on June 3, four days before the slayings.\nMurdaugh replied that he would be back that afternoon and that he \"had to deal with some bulls**t this morning.\"\nMURDAUGH COURT CLERK BECKY HILL RELEASED ON BOND AFTER ARREST ON PERJURY, MISCONDUCT CHARGES\n\"Ok Brother just give me a holler,\" Smith texted, later adding, \"Leaving the house now.\"\nThe day before the murders, Murdaugh texted Smith, \"Call me back.\"\nWithin a span of two minutes the morning after the murder, Smith texted Murdaugh, \"Tell me what I heard is not true,\" and, \"Call me please.\"\nThose texts went unreturned, and around 6:30 p.m., and Smith cryptically texted Murdaugh, \"At fishing hole.\"\nAfter that message also went unreturned, he texted, \"803 *** **13 it will not go through on my phone.\"\n\"Those texts, the ones we don't have, indicate a little more of the timeline of those distributions, and some of them are the week of the murder,\" Harpootlian said. \"And we were not aware of those. Had we been aware of these, it may have made a difference in our decision not to call Eddie Smith to the stand.\"\nHe also expressed concern that Smith had not been prosecuted for his alleged role in selling drugs to Murdaugh.\n\"And he has not been prosecuted. [He's] wandering the streets, I heard maybe out of the state, and we're perplexed why Eddie Smith has been given this preferential treatment when once Alex was convicted, there was no reason not to go ahead and prosecute him,\" said Harpootlian. \"Everybody else has pleaded guilty. Everybody else that was indicted has pleaded guilty except Eddie Smith. Now these texts would have given us additional information we believe, and I've talked to [co-counsel] Jim Griffin. It might have made the difference in us calling him to the stand or not calling him to the stand. So yes, they're important.\"\nMurdaugh is already appealing his conviction, based in large part on accusations of jury tampering by Colleton County Clerk of Court Becky Hill. She was arrested and charged with obstructing justice and misconduct in that incident.\nShe was also charged with perjury in Richland County in relation to the case, after allegedly lying to State Supreme Court Justice Jean Toal during 2024 appellate proceedings.\n\"We have an appeal based on errors made by the judge during the trial, and of course, the attempt by \u2014 or maybe she did \u2014 the efforts by the Clerk of Court, Becky Smith, to fix the jury. And that's a huge issue,\" said Harpootlian. \"Many of the people we've had look at the appeal believe we have a substantial chance of getting a new trial, just based on the jury tampering.\"\nHe said if they do not win a new trial, there is a possibility that they will file a habeas petition seeking to have the conviction vacated on the same grounds.\n\"The state's brief on the underlying appeal is due Aug. 8,\" he said. \"We have up to 30 days to reply. Then the Supreme Court decides whether to have argument, whether to grant it, whether deny it, and that could take months,\" he said, adding that if the appeal is granted Murdaugh will get a new trial.\nALEX MURDAUGH LAWYERS FILE APPEAL ALLEGING OUSTED SOUTH CAROLINA CLERK SWAYED JURY\nHarpootlian says he expects the state's high court to have a ruling on the appeal by early next year at the latest.\n\"And again, there are all kinds of debates about the evidence and how it was allowed in by the trial judge and whether it should have been excluded or allowed in. And those certainly are important. And we think there's several of them, individually, would give us a new trail,\" he said.\n\"But more important is a judge, former Chief Justice of Supreme Court, had an evidentiary hearing on Becky Hill's conduct in which she found: A) Becky Hill was not credible, and B) that Becky Hill did attempt to influence jurors to convict Alex Murdoch. She told several of her coworkers that she was writing a book, and it would be better for book sales if Alex was convicted. So we think that, and there is no clear state precedent on whether that's enough, but there's a clear federal precedent that we should get a new trial. So again, I think we should hear something before the end of the year or early next year.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nA retrial would likely look very different, Harpootlian said. With Murdaugh having already pleaded guilty to financial crimes, that aspect would be excluded, narrowing the scope to forensic and factual evidence.\nThe lead attorney believes Murdaugh has a strong defense.\n\"We had a six-week trial last time because of the financial misconduct. That won't happen again,\" Harpootlian said. \"And when you look solely at the forensic evidence, I believe it overwhelmingly proves Alex did not kill Paul and Maggie.\"\nThe South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, which led the investigation, and Prosecutor Creighton Waters did not return comment requests."
