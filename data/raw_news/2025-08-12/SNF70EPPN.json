  "content": "Police responded around 7 a.m. on Tuesday, Aug. 12, to several calls reporting \u201csignificant vandalism and damage\u201d being done to the headstones and monuments within St. Patrick\u2019s Cemetery at 94 Wall St. in Meriden, according to Lt. Darrin McKay. McKay said the responding officer met with the property maintenance company and the two walked the entire cemetery, noting the damage.\n\n\u201cDuring the walkthrough it was noted that roughly 100 headstones, monuments and obelisks had been knocked off their bases,\u201d McKay wrote in a news release. \u201cSome of the headstones that dated back to the 1800s were cracked in half and look to be unrepairable while others showed gouge marks that were consistent with the usage of a chain or cable.\u201d The officer noted that there were no tire marks in the grass, and due to the number and size of the monuments damaged, it is believed there are multiple suspects responsible, according to McKay.\n\n\u201cOfficers canvassed the area for witnesses and stopped at homes with camera systems in hopes of being able to identify potential suspects,\u201d McKay wrote. \u201cThe Meriden Police Department Detective Bureau will be assisting with the ongoing investigation.\u201d McKay said initial investigations and statements from residents indicate that the crime occurred between 8 p.m. on Aug. 11 and 7 a.m. on Aug. 12.",
