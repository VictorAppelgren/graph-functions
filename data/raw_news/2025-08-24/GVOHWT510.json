  "description": "Gates-founded NPO partners with Japan's government to support clean-tech commercialization. METI plans to fund project via GX bonds.",
  "content": "Breakthrough Energy, a U.S. nonprofit founded by Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, will partner with Japan's government to support decarbonization research beginning in fiscal 2026, with a focus on moving homegrown technologies from labs to market.\n\nThe organization will work with Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and offer subsidies and other backing in fields where Japan has strengths, notably biomass and hydrogen, to speed commercialization, states a fresh Nikkei report.\n\nThe nonprofit's Japan program, its next overseas expansion after launching a Southeast Asia hub in Singapore in 2024, aims to bridge research and deployment through university ventures and business-model advice, while opening pathways for Japanese innovations to enter the U.S. market.\n\nMETI plans to finance parts of the collaboration via Green Transformation (GX) transition bonds, a sovereign program designed to catalyze private capital for the energy shift.\n\nSee Also: Ray Dalio Calls Love The Most \u2018Important\u2019 Soft Skill Because Of This Reason And He\u2019s Talking From Experience\n\nGates created Breakthrough Energy in 2015 to accelerate climate solutions through a network that includes an affiliated nonprofit focused on early research and company building, alongside investment vehicles that back scaling companies. The investment firm has since been supported by Amazon.com, Inc. founder Jeff Bezos and Alibaba Group founder Jack Ma and has raised over $3.5 billion in committed capital, investing in more than 110 companies.\n\nThe venture has also invested $107 million in Sweden's Heart Aerospace to push its ES-30 hybrid-electric airplane toward commercial service. It also backs efforts to extract lithium from Utah's Great Salt Lake, aiming to secure a critical material for electric-vehicle batteries.\n\nNikkei notes that the Japan project, slated to start in April 2026, would cover technologies such as biotechnology, hydrogen, carbon dioxide capture and low-carbon steelmaking, complementing existing METI subsidy programs.\n\nThe push comes as Japan strives to convert world-class research into globally competitive companies. While policymakers have boosted \"GX\" financing, Japan has often lagged in commercialization compared with the U.S., industry analysts note.\n\u2022 Mark Cuban Is Avoiding Investing In This Sector: \u2018The Worst Industry In The History Of Industries\u2019",

Details here \u2192\nEntrepreneur Mark Cuban may owe a portion of his success to the media sector thanks to his founding of Broadcast.com and early days of advancing the streaming market.\nThese days, the media sector is one Cuban avoids when investing in companies.\nThe Worst Industry\nCuban is mostly staying away from investments in the media sector, he said in a recent interview with Semafor.\n\"It's the worst industry in the history of industries,\" Cuban said.\nCuban said artificial intelligence has made it easier for creators to launch media companies without relying on third-party companies.\n\"Media has changed forever.\"\nCuban said there is no limit if you're creative, as creators are less limited on time, funding, or access to professionals now than they were before.\nThe entrepreneur said media is faster, better and cheaper today.\nYou may not be a billionaire like Mark Cuban, but you can uncover hidden gems in the stock market using our proprietary data and pattern recognition \u2014 check out five stocks flying under the radar that deserve your attention.\nCuban's Media Start\nDuring the interview, Cuban recalled his early days in the media sector with the creation of Audionet, which would later become Broadcast.com.\nCuban remembered recording radio station feeds in Texas. During the interview, Cuban showed off the first two VCR tapes he used to record hours of radio content, which he now has framed.\nStreaming back in 1995 was extremely complicated, Cuban recalled, saying that you had to have a computer, a specific modem, subscription to internet service providers and download streaming client software.\nOver time, Cuban turned the efforts into a success with streaming radio stations, police scanners and Chicago Cubs games. This was also happening before there were digital copyright laws, Cuban added.\nStreaming a Victoria's Secret fashion show and sharing transcripts of the Monica Lewinsky, Bill Clinton tapes were big moments that led to huge traffic spikes for Cuban's company, he said.\nCuban later sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo for $5.7 billion.\nWhat Took So Long?\nCuban was confident in streaming years before others even knew what streaming was.\n\"Everyone would call me a f***ing moron,\" Cuban said.\nThe entrepreneur recalled saying streaming would replace television as things got cheaper and faster. Cuban said getting into cars and on phones was the moment he knew streaming had hit full scale.\nCuban is shocked at how long it took though.\n\"I thought by 2005, 2010 it would all be ubiquitous like it is now.\"\nCuban said people using Netflix don't even know that they're streaming today.\nRead Next:\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Love is more powerful than just about anything. So those soft skills are important skills.\"\nDalio's views arrive with the weight of his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. He founded Bridgewater in 1975 and built it into one of the world's largest hedge funds. He's also the author of the bestseller \"Principles,\" which codified his management philosophy.\nWhy Most Business Leaders Laud Compassionate Management\nOther business leaders have argued that compassion and empathy are core to performance. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, at a Vanity Fair summit in 2017, said, \"Empathy makes you a better innovator,\" and has called it \"the hardest skill we learn.\"\nLinkedIn's former CEO, Jeff Weiner, says, \"Managing compassionately is not just a better way to build a team, it's a better way to build a company.\" Psychologist and New York Times bestselling author Daniel Goleman famously wrote in Harvard Business Review that emotional intelligence is the \"sine qua non of leadership.\"\nDalio's soft-skills post fits a broader pattern of using social media to dispense leadership and economic advice, from diversification to building a disciplined \"gameplan,\" commentary he's amplified across interviews and posts.\nPhoto Courtesy: Vitalii Vodolazskyi on Shutterstock.com\nRead Next:\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "A California-based startup, Lilac Solutions, is gearing up to commence a project that will extract lithium from the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Backed by Bill Gates, Mitsubishi, and others, the initiative is set to begin this summer and aims to address the growing demand for lithium, a crucial component in electric vehicle batteries.\nWhat Happened: Lilac Solutions plans to employ a unique method that involves drawing water from the Great Salt Lake to extract lithium, a mineral in high demand due to the electric vehicle industry\u2019s rapid expansion, reported The Wall Street Journal on Monday. The company will then return the water to the lake, mitigating concerns about environmental damage caused by mineral extraction.\nThe company has secured $145 million in funding from investors such as Gates\u2019s Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Japanese industrial conglomerate Mitsubishi. It is also in talks with major battery manufacturers and automakers seeking a domestic supply of battery-grade lithium.\nAt its peak, the project will extract 80,000 gallons of water per minute, yielding up to 20,000 tons of battery-grade lithium annually. This endeavor is one of many across the U.S. striving to establish a domestic lithium and battery mineral supply, in line with the nation\u2019s shift to cleaner energy.\nDespite the vast lithium resources in the U.S., the extraction process remains a challenge due to its complex chemistry. Lilac\u2019s CEO, Dave Snydacker, asserts that their method, which uses reusable ceramic \u201cbeads\u201d to extract lithium from brine, is more environmentally friendly than traditional techniques.\nWhy It Matters: The demand for lithium has been on the rise, driven by the electric vehicle boom. In 2023, the Department of Energy discovered what is believed to be the world\u2019s largest supply of lithium beneath California\u2019s Salton Sea, estimated to be worth up to $540 billion and capable of meeting America\u2019s demand for decades to come.\nDespite a slump in battery metals, companies like American Lithium have continued to make significant strides in lithium production, with the company\u2019s Falchani lithium project in Peru seeing a threefold increase in its estimated value.\nLilac Solutions\u2019 innovative approach to lithium extraction not only addresses environmental concerns but also contributes to the U.S.\u2019s efforts to establish a robust domestic supply chain for battery minerals, reducing its reliance on China, the global leader in battery mineral production.\nRead Next: Donald Trump\u2019s Infamous Hush Money Case Involving Stormy Daniels To Come To Forefront Next Month\nImage via Shutterstock\nEngineered by Benzinga Neuro, Edited by Pooja Rajkumari\nThe GPT-4-based Benzinga Neuro content generation system exploits the extensive Benzinga Ecosystem, including native data, APIs, and more to create comprehensive and timely stories for you.
