  "description": "When Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stepped down as working royals there was one overwhelming reason they gave for their decision: privacy.",
  "content": "When Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stepped down as working royals there was one overwhelming reason they gave for their decision: privacy.\n\nThe couple expressed their frustration at the intense public scrutiny they encountered and claimed the constant barrage of criticism was detrimental to their well-being.\n\nHowever, in the subsequent years since 'Megxit', Harry and Meghan have raised eyebrows as the Sussexes appeared less concerned about their privacy than they originally claimed.\n\nNowhere more so was this evident than during Harry and Meghan's bombshell interview with Oprah, in which serious allegations were wedged against the Royal Family.\n\nHere the couple talked openly about Meghan's mental health and claimed one - unnamed - member of the family had speculated about the colour of their son Archie's skin when Meghan was pregnant in a racist way.\n\nUnsurprisingly it wasn't long before their contradictory behaviour was noticed by the media and even parodied on the American series South Park, where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were portrayed as talking heads who demanded privacy but still embarked a 'Worldwide Privacy Tour'.\n\nWhile their actions since they stepped down have been mocked, royal author Tom Quinn tries to answer why.\n\nHe claims that 'if Meghan really wanted to be a private person, all she needed to do was go back to America and keep quiet - but what Meghan wants is privacy combined with world fame'.\n\nQuinn exposes this flaw in Meghan's argument using the Oprah interview as an example where Meghan 'aired grievances' without her statements being 'challenged'.\n\n'The deep danger can be glimpsed when in the Oprah interview Meghan is encouraged to speak \"her truth\". Well, if we all have our own versions of the truth then there is no truth. Speaking \"my truth\" is just a way of ennobling what is after all just one person's opinion.'\n\nOn top of this, Quinn highlights that the media has become a tried and tested means of thrashing out grievances between the royals.\n\n'Their decisions to use the media to air their complaints about the family has frightening echoes of Charles and Diana turning to television to wash their dirty linen in public,' he wrote.\n\n'But Meghan and Harry have gone much further because they exposed themselves to forensic examination.'\n\nHowever, Quinn also attempted to paint a more sympathetic image of the Duchess of Sussex who was 'sinned against'.\n\nHe said: 'Meghan is perhaps both sinned against and sinning. It is true that she genuinely wants to do good in the world even if the British find her \"Californian therapy speak\" embarrassing and insincere.\n\n'But it is also true that Meghan is a powerful personality determined to get her way. To use Harry's own phrase, \"What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.\" And Harry should know.'\n\n'Meghan does seem to decide to a larger extent what she and her husband do and where they go. She does believe that the Royal Family did not give her what she needed, and that the family should have listened to her and changed to suit her.'\n\nAside from a claimed desire for more privacy, leaving Windsor for Montecito also brought with it financial opportunities.\n\nAccording to royal author Valentine Low, it was Meghan's yearning to monetise her royal title which led to 'Megxit'.\n\nWriting in his tell-all book Courtiers, Low claims that Meghan's desire to 'earn money for herself' led the couple to abandon their duties entirely.\n\nLow revealed that during discussions about how to reach a happy middle ground - which could please the whole family - multiple scenarios were explored.\n\nThese ranged from Harry and Meghan 'having a month or a year to do their own thing' to 'spending most of their time privately but doing a select number of royal activities'.\n\nThe one caveat for the Sussexes continuing royal duties - however small or minor - was that they must stick to the 'normal rules about royal behaviour'.\n\nCrucially, that would mean Harry and Meghan could not 'act or take decisions in order to gain financially'.\n\nLow writes: 'Some suspected that in the end she wanted to make money. And the only way she was going to do that was by leaving her royal life behind and going back to America.'\n\nIndeed, since stepping down as a working royal, Meghan appears to have focused much of her energy on her solo business projects and media projects - with the next season of With Love, Meghan set to debut next week.",

  "summary": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, who stepped down as working royals due to intense public scrutiny, initially claimed their privacy was paramount due to the intense scrutiny they faced. However, since their departure, they have appeared less concerned about their privacy than they initially claimed. This was particularly noticeable during their interview with Oprah, where they discussed Meghan's mental health and speculated about the colour of their son's skin. Their actions have been mocked by the media, including the American series South Park. Royal author Tom Quinn suggests that if Meghan really wanted to be a private person, she could have done so, but what Meghan wants is privacy and world fame. He also criticises the couple's use of media to air grievances about the Royal Family, which he argues is a means of resolving these issues. Valentine Low, royal author, suggests that Meghan\u2019s desire to monetise her royal title led to her abandoning her duties entirely.",

      "text": "As her first major event on behalf of the Royal Family, the spotlight was shining firmly on the former actress.\nJust a month before the royal wedding, Meghan Markle joined Prince Harry to meet youth delegates taking part in the high-profile Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London.\nIt marked an important step in introducing Harry's bride-to-be to the world stage and came as a surprise to royal observers, as it is unusual for someone who has not yet married into the Royal Family to be involved in such a high-profile occasion.\nBut according to body language expert Judi James, the couple's dynamic showed 'green shoots of Meghan inducting Harry into the etiquette of non-royal life'.\nOne moment in particular showed Meghan attempting to walk in front of Harry, which goes against royal protocol.\nHarry also takes a step forward to shake hands with a man opposite him, causing the two to bump into each other.\nThe Prince promptly stepped back, before apologising and allowing Meghan to take the lead.\nBody language expert Judi James told the Daily Mail: 'At the time this seemed like nothing more than a small body language reset for Harry, who had taken protocol as the norm all his life but who had chosen a US actress and self-proclaimed feminist as his wife, suggesting a desire for change.\nJust a month before the royal wedding, Meghan Markle joined Prince Harry to meet youth delegates taking part in the high-profile Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London\nAccording to body language expert Judi James, the couple's dynamic showed 'green shoots of Meghan inducting Harry into the etiquette of non-royal life'\nThe event marked an important step in introducing Harry's bride-to-be to the world stage and came as a surprise to royal observers, as it is unusual for someone who has not yet married into the Royal Family to be involved in such a high-profile occasion\n'Harry had been the star of his own show for decades, and his personal brand was about military strength and daring laced with a cheeky sense of humour.\n'The traditional royal role would be for him to induct his bride into the complicated and archaic choreography of royal life, but what we saw here was the green shoots of Meghan inducting Harry into the etiquette of non-royal life.'\nAt the time, etiquette expert William Hanson said: 'From a protocol point of view, Harry should have gone first as Meghan is the consort.\n'But from a chivalry point of view, it is always preferable to let your spouse or girlfriend go first. So he wasn't wrong, but he wasn't right either.'\nJudi continued: 'Even in these few moments of prancing wobbles and redirection, we can see Meghan's social confidence glow while Harry's insecurities rise closer to the surface.\n'He is the one having to learn to synchronise with another person. Meghan has already been married, and her TV career will have allowed her to know all about moving smoothly and competently with someone else by her side, either on set or in real life.\n'When there's a misstep, it's Harry who leaps into correction mode, while Meghan always sees her movements through to the end.\n'Her trait of mirroring Harry's animated gesticulation on two occasions here shows she is taking some cues from him in terms of royal chats, but she seems to pick up on his emphatic and illustrated gesticulation to ensure he doesn't upstage her socially.\nA screengrab from the video clip shows the moment before Harry and Meghan both step forward to shake hands with a man opposite them\nThe split-second moment shows, according to the body language expert, Meghan's social confidence glow while Harry's insecurities rise closer to the surface\nThe Prince can be seen promptly stepping back, before apologising and allowing Meghan to take the lead\n'Once she has a group's attention, we can see her very naturally and elegantly retain it.\n'At that point, Harry even stands back and puts one hand in his pocket as he sees her natural ability and charisma begin to kick in.'\nComing off the back of her role as Rachel Zane in Suits, Meghan was used to the spotlight.\nJudi continued: 'When they say farewell to the first group, Meghan moves in closer than Harry to display her talent for more immersive chats.\n'Harry moves towards the man at the end of the line but it's he who notices that would put him ahead of Meghan and instead he hops back obediently to follow her round instead, even miming a crossing movement with his arms and raising a finger in what looks like a mock telling off to apparently make a joke about avoiding any clashing.\n'Harry seems to show signs of anxiety in some of the close-ups here.\n'His blink rate is rapid, and he shows his tongue between his teeth and his lips. As he walks to the second group, he even clasps his left wrist in his right hand as though unsure about how and when to shake hands.\n'It's Meghan who takes the decision for him now, bending her knees to duck in and step quietly in front to get in first with the second group.\nAt the time, etiquette expert William Hanson said: 'From a protocol point of view, Harry should have gone first as Meghan is the consort'\nJudi said: 'When there's a misstep, it's Harry who leaps into correction mode, while Meghan always sees her movements through to the end'\nThe body language expert continued: 'Meghan's group chat here shows her early skills in terms of earning attention and genuine interest'\nMeghan is pictured shaking hands with delegates at the reception for the Commonwealth Youth Forum\n'Harry makes a similar decision, possibly based on protocol-led assumption but he is given what looks like a swift example of modern etiquette as Meghan puts a splayed hand out in a non-verbal tie-sign to stop him.\n'Harry dutifully steps back to usher Meghan through, using a rather old-fashioned gallant steering gesture to do so.\n'She finishes chatting to the group first and waits for him and as he spots her he seems to speed up his greetings to avoid leaving her standing.\n'Meghan's group chat here shows her early skills in terms of earning attention and genuine interest.\n'Her raised brows signal engagement and authority: this is the gesture of someone you would listen to, and her animated gestures show interest and engagement rather than small talk.'\nA similar dynamic occurred in July 2018 when Harry and Meghan undertook a two-day visit to Dublin, shortly after their wedding.\nJudi told the Daily Mail: 'Meghan and Harry's first overseas visit soon after their wedding was a relatively \"soft\" one, but this trip still provided a clear showcase for their body language dynamic as a royal couple.\n'When it comes to analysing their choreography and their power signals, hindsight really is a strong benefit here because at the time we were led by assumption.\nAt the event, the bride-to-be takes the lead, which reflects a pattern later emerging in Harry and Meghan's relationship dynamic\nMeghan is pictured as Rachel Zane in the Netflix series Suits\nEven before Meghan officially became a Duchess, Harry - pictured earlier this year - allowed his wife to take centre stage at events while he followed her lead\n'We assumed we were seeing new bride Meghan nervously learning the ropes, being ushered and protected by her confident and experienced new husband.\n'But in fact, looking at the less than subtle signals now, the opposite appears to have been true.'\nAs recently as April this year, Meghan took centre stage at the Time 100 Summit in New York, leaving Harry to assume the role of 'spare'.\nWhile some considered Harry to be merely adopting the role of doting husband, the body language expert told the Daily Mail that Harry was displaying some 'awkward-looking body language poses while a more assured Meghan takes the starring role'.\nMeghan's half-brother, Tom Junior, told the Express that his sister was 'always the centre of attention, so that never stopped', adding that she has 'star quality'.\nIt is clear to see that Meghan is most at ease in the spotlight and performing on stage.\nThis translates into their body language dynamic, meaning even before she officially became a Duchess, Harry allowed his wife to take centre stage at events while he followed her lead."

and their recent joint engagements - are known to be a great source of pride for Harry.\nToday's claims are not in Robert Jobson's new book 'Charles At Seventy: Thoughts, Hopes And Dreams' - but it does say Harry was said to have been 'petulant and short-tempered' in the build up to the Windsor Castle wedding.\nHe allegedly told staff with a raised voice: 'What Meghan wants, Meghan gets' and when reports of his 'tiresome behaviour' reached the Queen who asked to see her grandson privately and she 'put him firmly in his place', Mr Jobson wrote.\nScroll down for video\nThe Queen had words with Prince Harry over his 'difficult' bride's choice of wedding tiara, it has been claimed\nThe diamond and platinum bandeau tiara worn by Meghan is on display at the A Royal Wedding exhibition at Windsor Castle, which a royal source claimed was not her preferred option\nMeghan picked the tiara from the Queen's collection during a visit to Buckingham Palace with Prince Harry.\nAnd she gave no hint that it wasn't her first choice.\nShe described her visit to see the Queen and choose a headpiece for her wedding as 'an incredibly surreal day'.\nMeghan and Prince Harry recorded their memories of the wedding for an audio commentary that is part of the new 'Relive the Royal Wedding' exhibition at Windsor Castle, which opened last month.\nSpeaking about the tiara she wore, Meghan said: 'When it came to the tiara on the day, I was very fortunate to be able to choose this gorgeous art deco style bandeau tiara.\n'Harry and I had gone to Buckingham Palace to meet with Her Majesty The Queen to select one of the options that were there, which was an incredibly surreal day as you can imagine.\n'And that was the one that, I think, as we tried them on, stood out.'\nA royal insider told The Sun the Queen (pictured on Wednesday) stepped in and told Harry: 'She gets what tiara she's given by me' after an alleged row\nMeghan Markle, pictured with the Queen in June, is said to have a very good relationship with Her Majesty\nShe added: 'I think it was just perfect because it was so clean and simple - and also to that point, an extension of what Clare [Waight Keller] and I had been trying to do with the dress which was have something that could be so incredibly timeless but still feel modern.'\nHarry joked in the commentary: 'Every girl's dream to be able to try on a tiara, and, funnily enough, the one that suited the best, the one that looked the best on you without question, I shouldn't have really even been there, but such an incredible loan by my grandmother, it was very sweet.'\nWhen Harry and Meghan's romance was revealed in December 2016 the Queen was one of their main cheerleaders.\nThe Queen was apparently charmed by her and was 'fully supportive' of her grandson's relationship with the actress and was 'delighted to see Harry in a loving relationship'.\nIn June - a month after she married Harry - she showed her growing bond with the Queen as the pair carried out their first official engagements together in Cheshire.\nMeghan, 36, and the monarch, 92, were obviously getting on famously, with Meghan giggling and whispering into the Queen's ear while watching a children's performance at the opening of a new bridge across the River Mersey in Widnes.\nIt was around ten months after her own nuptials before the Duchess of Cambridge undertook a similar day of events - and was viewed as a sign of royal confidence in the former actress.\nMost watched News videos\n- Student gets instant karma after slapping school employee\n- Mom's disturbing TikTok post days before family's murder suicide\n- Moment man attacks 13-year-old boy on train\n- Tragic videos mom posted days before killing kids and husband\n- Pro-Palestinian protester gets into appropriation argument with DC cop\n- Shocking moment TV reporter is mugged live on air by phone thief\n- Fed-up shark BITES Florida man posing with predator for photo\n- Italy is hit by deadly floods and a bridge crumbles in Sicily\n- Cycling Mikey chases after suspected phone thieves on e-bikes\n- Teen charged with murdering mother and stepfather smiles at court\n- Anti-semitic neighbors shout slurs at father of fallen Israel soldier\n- Moment police dog clamps down and bites dangerous driver"

      "text": "Megyn Kelly slams Meghan Markle for claiming someone in Royal Family is a racist but NOT ruling out 'suffering 99-year-old' Prince Philip as Twitter mob starts to speculate\n- Harry and Meghan claimed unnamed royal was worried about Archie's skin tone\n- Former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly says this led to social media speculation\n- No suggestion that Philip, 99, who is still in hospital in London, is responsible\nThe Duchess of Sussex was criticised today for not specifically ruling out the Duke of Edinburgh when sensationally accusing a Royal Family member of racism.\nHarry and Meghan claimed a royal, whom they both refused to identify, was worried about how dark their son Archie's skin tone might be before he was born.\nBut former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly said the lack of a name had led to social media speculation mounting in the US over the person being Prince Philip.\nThere is no suggestion that the 99-year-old Duke was responsible, and Buckingham Palace has not yet commented on the claims made in the Oprah Winfrey interview.\nThe claims relating to Philip may have been made because of his famous history of gaffes, but ITV royal correspondent Chris Ship told Good Morning Britain today that he had been told it was neither the Queen nor Prince Philip who made the remark.\nPhilip was taken to King Edward VII Hospital in London on February 16 for treatment for an infection, before having heart surgery at St Bartholomew's Hospital last week.\nSpeaking to ITV's Good Morning Britain, Ms Kelly said: 'Her implication that someone in the Royal Family objected to her having a baby of colour could, right here, the speculation on Twitter is that it was Prince Philip, right, so I don't know who it was.\n'But while the guy's in a hospital you might want to put like a corral around him, and say I can tell you it's not the suffering 99-year-old \u2013 I don't know, something, to throw the guy a bone.'\nThere had been growing calls over the past week for Harry and Meghan to postpone their two-hour interview for CBS out of respect for Philip and his ill health.\nIn the interview, Meghan said, when she was pregnant with Archie, an unnamed member of the royal family raised 'concerns and conversations about how dark his skin might be when he's born'.\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex are pictured during their interview with Oprah Winfrey\nThe American duchess is the first mixed race person to marry a British senior royal in modern history. A stunned Oprah asked: 'What? Who is having that conversation?'\nMeghan paused and said there were 'several conversations' with Harry about Archie's skin tone, and 'what that would mean or look like'.\nAsked whether there were concerns that her child would be 'too brown' and that would be a problem, Meghan said: 'If that is the assumption you are making, that is a pretty safe one.'\nPushed by Oprah on who had those conversations, Meghan refused to say, adding: 'I think that would be very damaging to them.'\nPrince Philip is pictured during a military ceremony at Windsor Castle on July 22 last year\nHarry refused to give further details, adding: 'That conversation, I am never going to share. At the time it was awkward, I was a bit shocked.'\nThe Duke also said that none of his relatives spoke out in support of Meghan following the alleged racism he said she faced in the media.\n'No-one from my family ever said anything over those three years. That hurts,' Harry said.\n'But I also am acutely aware of where my family stand, and how scared they are of the tabloids turning on them.'\nPrince Harry and his wife Meghan hold Archie in Cape Town while visiting in September 2019\nMeghan spoke of her upset, particularly with the Commonwealth being such an important factor for the monarchy.\nThe duchess said: 'I could never understand how it wouldn't be seen as an added benefit and a reflection of the world today at all times, but especially right now, to go how inclusive is that you can see someone who looks like you in this family, much less one who's born into it.'\nThe Sussexes have been vocal supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement.\nFormer Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly speaks to ITV's Good Morning Britain today\nMeghan previously delivered an impassioned Black Lives Matter speech to her old high school following the death of George Floyd in the US, sharing her 'absolute devastation' at racial divisions.\nHarry has also outlined his personal commitment to tackling institutional racism in a message to children and young adults at The Diana Awards ceremony.\nBut he admitted in the past that his privileged upbringing as a member of the royal family meant he had no understanding of unconscious racial bias.\nHarry said it took him many years - and the experience of 'living' in wife Meghan's shoes - to recognise the issue.\nMost watched News videos\n- Student gets instant karma after slapping school employee\n- Mom's disturbing TikTok post days before family's murder suicide\n- Moment man attacks 13-year-old boy on train\n- Tragic videos mom posted days before killing kids and husband\n- Pro-Palestinian protester gets into appropriation argument with DC cop\n- Shocking moment TV reporter is mugged live on air by phone thief\n- Fed-up shark BITES Florida man posing with predator for photo\n- Italy is hit by deadly floods and a bridge crumbles in Sicily\n- Cycling Mikey chases after suspected phone thieves on e-bikes\n- Teen charged with murdering mother and stepfather smiles at court\n- Anti-semitic neighbors shout slurs at father of fallen Israel soldier\n- Moment police dog clamps down and bites dangerous driver"
