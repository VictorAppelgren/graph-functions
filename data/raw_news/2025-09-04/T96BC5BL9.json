  "content": "I bought as many protein-packed pasta brands as I could find to put them to the test.They've recently become available in a wider range of shapes, but since penne has a tendency to break and spaghetti can get soggy and sticky if not handled properly, I decided to only use spiral noodles for the taste test.To prepare the pasta, I individually cooked 1 \u00bd ounces of each brand in a small pot of water for around seven minutes.I first tasted them all plain while still warm, then again after they cooled to see if the texture changed. For the second part of the test, I reheated the pasta and tossed it in Rao's Homemade tomato-and-basil sauce.Read on to see how it went.",

      "text": "- Walmart's new Bettergoods brand is strikingly similar to the Good & Gather line from Target.\n- I picked up a range of comparable items from each to see which is better.\n- While I couldn't pick a decisive winner, the real advantage here goes to customers.\nWhether you call them store brands, private labels, or something else, companies like Target are investing big bucks to ensure shoppers don't think of their in-house offerings as \"generic.\"\nThe latest significant entry into this premium owned-brand space comes from Walmart, which in April announced its Bettergoods line as the company's \"largest private brand food launch in 20 years.\"\nWhile the brand emphasizes interesting taste combinations and plant-based recipes, I found a closer look at the products revealed a striking resemblance to another shopper favorite: Target's Good & Gather.\nTarget launched Good & Gather five years ago, promising food products free of artificial flavors, colors, and high-fructose corn syrup, and has grown the line to include over 2,000 products. Walmart had 300 products in April.\nGood & Gather now generates more than $3 billion in sales for the Bullseye, so it's no surprise that Walmart would want a slice of the action.\nTo better understand the competition Bettergoods represents, I figured a taste test was in order.\nSince Bettergoods is just getting started, I went to Walmart first.\nI looked for a range of snacks, mains, and dessert options but skipped things like seltzers, non-dairy milk, and seasonings.\nThen I headed to Target.\nI did my best to match the Walmart basket with selections from Target's far more extensive collection.\nThe first thing that struck me was how closely I was able to match the baskets.\nAlmost every Bettergoods item had a counterpart from Good & Gather (or the sister brand Favorite Day, for ice cream).\nNaturally I expected some degree of similarity, which is why I decided to write this story in the first place, but the likeness between brands was quite surprising.\nI was able to roughly match 13 items.\nHere's what made the cut: frozen chicken wings/bites; fancy potato chips; corn salsas and fire-roasted salsas; plant-based shredded cheese; cauliflower crust frozen pizzas; Greek yogurts; beef empanadas; fritter balls; phyllo pastries; fancy traditional ice cream; and non-dairy ice cream.\nMy surprise increased when I saw how close the two brands were in terms of pricing.\nWith very few exceptions, most items were within a few nickels or dimes of their counterparts. Even if an item from one brand was more expensive, that was offset by another item being less expensive, so the overall baskets of 13 items each were within six cents of each other.\nIn terms of quality, most of the products were also quite similar.\nI think they could easily be sold under the competitor's branding, and you'd be hard-pressed to tell which was out of place.\nOne item that did stand out was the potato chips.\nTarget's Good & Gather offers a kettle-style chip seasoned with interesting flavor combinations, like Parmesan and garlic.\nWalmart's Bettergoods offering had a simple pink salt seasoning on what seemed to be a slightly overcooked traditional chip. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't that special, either.\nThe salsas were generally on par.\nBettergoods had a slight edge here. I noticed the Walmart brand features a family recipe and is made in Texas.\nBettergoods shone when it came to the wings and the bulgogi empanadas.\nThey were much more satisfying than the Good & Gather buffalo bites (dry) and jalape\u00f1o empanadas (tiny).\nBoth brands' pizzas were somewhat disappointing.\nThis is a high bar for me, considering how well I think Costco's Kirkland Signature makes its cauliflower crust. Still, between the two choices on the table, Walmart was marginally better.\nGood & Gather had slightly better appetizers.\nWhile I preferred the Good & Gather lobster mac and cheese bites to Bettergoods' croquettes, neither was much of a hit with my toddlers.\nGood & Gather also did better with their fluffy and flaky spinach and feta spanakopita than Bettergoods did with their flat and chewy fig and orange phyllo bites.\nDessert was a split decision. No real losers here. I mean, who doesn't like ice cream?\nOn the traditional ice cream front, I found Bettergoods' pistachio flavor somewhat overpowering, but Target's Favorite Day s'mores ice cream was soft, rich, and delicious, even though I accidentally bought the reduced fat option.\nFor the non-dairy version, however, Bettergoods' oat-milk-based blueberry swirl was slightly better in flavor and texture than the Favorite Day almond-milk strawberry fudge. Both were nearly as good as many dairy-based choices.\nTwo things are clear from this experiment.\nWalmart has successfully launched a high quality brand that would fit right in on Target's shelves, but Bettergoods has a very long road ahead before it will match Good & Gather's full lineup.\nSo who comes out ahead after these too-close-to-calls and offsetting wins? Customers.\nAt a time when household grocery budgets are stretched to their limits, Walmart and Target are in a welcome competition to provide high-quality foods at very manageable prices.\nI hope they keep it up."

      "text": "- I tried three celebrity chefs' recipes for pasta salad to find my new potluck go-to.\n- Although I'd swap the Miracle Whip for regular mayo, Sunny Anderson's dish was my favorite.\n- I would happily make Guy Fieri and Robert Irvine's pasta salads again with a few adjustments.\nAlthough many people have their tried-and-true recipe, there are so many ways to make pasta salad \u2014 some versions are filled with fresh squash and herbs, loaded with cheddar and bacon, or packed with spicy ingredients for an added kick.\nSo I decided to try three different recipes from celebrity chefs Guy Fieri, Robert Irvine, and Sunny Anderson to find the best one.\nFieri's pasta salad features a rainbow of fresh ingredients\nFieri is known for bold flavor combinations, and his pasta salad is no exception.\nThe ingredients list looks long, but it's mostly an array of colorful produce like roasted red peppers, carrots, celery, red onion, and pepperoncinis, but my grocery spot only had banana peppers, so I used those instead. The store was also out of peppadew peppers, so I skipped them.\nAside from that, this recipe calls for classic elbow macaroni as well as kitchen staples like mayonnaise, mustard, white vinegar, and garlic for the sauce.\nThe chopping took the most amount of time\nI could have used a food processor to speed things up, but I didn't mind taking the time to chop and mince all of the produce. Although this part took the longest, the rest was a breeze.\nWhile the pasta boiled, I mixed the tangy sauce together and moved it to the fridge to chill.\nOnce the pasta had cooked and cooled in an ice bath, this salad was as simple as mixing the noodles, sauce, and chopped ingredients together in a large bowl, then chilling it all for an hour so the flavors could combine.\nThis pasta salad had a nice amount of heat and a great contrast of textures\nI wasn't sure how I'd feel about this one. Although I love peppers and onions, I'm not a huge fan of raw carrots or celery. Thankfully, I couldn't taste much of either, but I'd still cut down on those additions next time.\nThat said, they added a lot of crunch, which balanced the softness of the noodles.\nThe dressing didn't have a lot of flavor since it was primarily made with mayo, so most of the dish's tang and spice came from the red onions and banana peppers, but I really loved how this kick paired with the cool, creamy sauce.\nIrvine's pasta salad features fresh herbs and omits mayo\nThis pasta salad stood out to me because it doesn't call for mayonnaise. Instead, Irvine uses a homemade dressing made with apple cider vinegar, garlic, dried herbs, stone-ground mustard, salt, pepper, and extra-virgin olive oil.\nThe pasta salad itself includes sun-dried tomatoes, basil, parsley, and fresh summer squash, which I admittedly wasn't sure how I'd like uncooked but hoped for the best.\nThis was another easy recipe to assemble\nWhile the farfalle \u2014 commonly known as bow-tie \u2014 pasta cooked, I blended the dressing ingredients until everything was thoroughly combined before chopping the squash and washing the herbs.\nWhen the pasta was done, I drained and moved it to a bowl. This recipe doesn't specify to cool the noodles in a cold rinse or ice bath, so they were warm when I mixed them with the dressing and toppings.\nI added most of the dressing into the pasta, reserving some to serve with the finished dish, then stirred in the sun-dried tomatoes, basil, parsley, and chopped squash. The recipe doesn't state to cut the herbs, but I tore them up a bit before adding them to the dish.\nEven though I didn't chill or rinse the pasta before mixing it with the other ingredients, it quickly cooled down and was below room temperature by the time I served it.\nThis pasta salad's lack of mayo makes it perfect for warmer days\nThe delicious dressing added a touch of acidity and tang that didn't overpower the fresh ingredients, and I also loved how the sun-dried tomatoes gave the dish some sweetness and a chewy texture that was different than the crunchy squash and soft noodles.\nI was right to be skeptical about the uncooked summer squash, so next time, I'd lightly fry or roast the ingredient before adding it in, but this could just be because I don't like raw yellow squash or zucchini.\nI'd also chop the herbs instead of just tearing them, as I wasn't a fan of eating huge bites of basil.\nOverall, I enjoyed the unique blend of flavors and really liked that the dressing didn't contain eggs or dairy. I could see myself making this for outdoor events to avoid having mayo sit out in the heat.\nAnderson's recipe most resembles the pasta salads I grew up eating\nI couldn't wait to get started on Anderson's pasta salad, which has the shortest list of ingredients and amount of prep time. This recipe also calls for peas, cheddar, and bacon, a combination I really like for its juxtaposing salty and sweet flavors.\nPer the recipe's suggestion, I used Miracle Whip even though I prefer standard mayo, but since I don't eat meat, I opted for plant-based bacon.\nThis recipe reminds me a lot of the pasta salads my mom made when I was growing up, although she often used ranch dressing as the base.\nThis pasta salad required minimal prep work\nI used cavatappi pasta (macaroni with a corkscrew shape) per the recipe's recommendation, and while the noodles boiled, I cooked my \"bacon,\" shredded some cheddar cheese, and let the peas thaw.\nThe sauce was simple to throw together since I just combined Miracle Whip, anchovy-free Worcestershire sauce, red onion, apple cider vinegar, sugar, salt, and pepper.\nWhen the noodles were cooked, drained, and cooled via a cold rinse, I mixed in the dressing and added the \"bacon\" crumbles, shredded cheese, and unfrozen peas.\nI loved this flavor combination, but I'd definitely swap Miracle Whip for mayo next time\nAs I anticipated, the contrast of sweet peas, salty bacon, and savory cheese was a winner.\nThe Miracle Whip added a lot of tang, and although it was OK, I'd much prefer a more neutral mayo, so I'll definitely make this in the future with that swap in mind.\nI enjoyed all of the pasta salads, but I'd deem Anderson's the winner if I had to choose\nI went into this taste test expecting a clear winner but actually really enjoyed all of the recipes. Although there are little things I'd change about each one, I'd make any of these options again.\nIf I had to pick my favorite, I'd go with Anderson's recipe, which is the only one that added cheese and had some nostalgia to it since it's similar to what I ate as a kid, but I'd just use regular mayonnaise for the dressing next time.\nThe other two recipes were also delicious. For Fieri's pasta salad, I'd cut back on the carrots and celery, and I'd lightly cook the squash and finely chop the fresh herbs if I make Irvine's again.\nClick to check out the other celebrity-chef recipes we've put head-to-head so far.\nWhen you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission.

      "text": "Thinking of going vegan but worried it\u2019s going to be too expensive? I was, too. A plant-based diet can be pretty pricey if you get carried away at the grocery store, but there are ways to make it work without breaking the bank.\nAfter a few trips to the grocery store, I learned a few hacks that make eating vegan super budget-friendly. With these tips, you\u2019ll be able to stick to the diet without emptying your wallet.\nBe picky when it comes to vegan alternatives.\nThere are some delicious vegan cheeses and meat substitutes on the market, but they are pretty expensive. They may look tempting, but they\u2019ll add up quickly at the cash register. When it comes to vegan substitutes, ask yourself if you absolutely need them. If you don\u2019t, pass on them for now to save some cash.\nKeep recipes simple.\nMany vegan recipes call for garnishes that aren\u2019t especially necessary, and purchasing all of those extras in the grocery store can eat up a good amount of your budget. Cut down on costs by keeping your meals uncomplicated and finding creative ways to make them delicious like adding spices, including extra veggies, or mixing in hummus.\nUse spices.\nAdding some spice to your dishes is an easy way to make bland, simple dishes super flavorful. The jars may be a little pricey at first, but they\u2019ll last a long time and can make any meal taste delicious in a few seconds.\nBuy frozen instead of fresh.\nIf you\u2019re really trying to live frugally, consider buying frozen vegetables or fruit instead of mostly fresh. It\u2019s an easy way to make sure that your produce doesn\u2019t go bad after a week in the fridge (we\u2019ve all been there) and will save you some major cash. Plus, frozen bags of fruits and veggies are always great to have on hand for a quick and nutritious meal.\nFind cheaper alternatives if you\u2019re in a bind.\nFeeling especially stressed about your grocery bill? Swap out some pricier ingredients for cost-friendly substitutes. Small changes like switching out quinoa for brown rice will end up saving you lots of money in the long run.\nEat before you go grocery shopping.\nThis one applies to vegans and non-vegans alike, but going grocery shopping on an empty stomach can cause some serious damage to your wallet (especially with all those tempting vegan desserts, drinks, and snacks). Make sure you\u2019ve eaten before you head out, bring a list, and buy only what you need.\nFor more great stories, head to INSIDER's homepage."

      "text": "- Jarred pasta sauce from the grocery store can be easy to prepare, relatively inexpensive, and delicious.\n- Although chefs prefer homemade stuff, they said they enjoy sauces from brands like Trader Giotto's and Rao's.\n- In a pinch, some chefs swear by taking canned crushed tomatoes and adding seasoning to them.\nChefs have a reputation for being anti-pre-prepared-anything, but sometimes they rely on jarred goods when whipping up a pasta dish.\nHere are the best jarred sauces out there, according to chefs.\nColavita is easy to jazz up.\n\"I'm a fan of Colavita pasta sauce. I like its smooth texture and robust tomato flavor without all the additional dried herbs and spice that often are heavy-handed in some other brands,\" Claudia Sidoti, head chef and recipe developer at HelloFresh, told Insider.\n\"It's a great base and makes it easy to jazz up with some fresh basil or a little kick from chili flakes,\" she added.\nRao's is great for stuffed shells.\n\"Rao's jarred sauce is always my favorite when putting together a quick meal at home,\" Christian Petroni, chef at Fortina, told Insider.\n\"I always keep homemade stuffed shells in my freezer. One of my favorite things is whipping those babies up with a jar of Rao's sauce. Throw it in the oven, comes out delicious and beautiful. It is too good,\" they added.\nMuir Glen Pasta Sauce is a great option for some chefs.\n\"I was not allowed to even look at sauce in a glass jar growing up unless my grandmother and I put it in that jar,\" Chef Al Di Meglio, of Brooklyn's Barano, told Insider. \"However, with busy schedules of everyday life, I get it. If I had to choose a jarred sauce, I would go with Muir Glen.\"\nHe said he'd add some basil, sauteed garlic, and extra-virgin olive oil to the sauce before serving it up.\nGia Russa is this chef's go-to pick.\n\"I do sneak in jarred sauce on occasion and like to use Gia Russa,\" said Chef Jason Campbell of Mary Eddy's in Oklahoma City.\nHe said he likes the limited ingredients and flavor profile of the sauce.\n\"I do like to doctor up the jarred sauce a bit and toast fresh garlic, red-pepper flakes, anchovy paste in olive oil and then add a bit of fresh chopped tomatoes and a parm rind if I have one,\" he told Insider. \"I add this to the jarred sauce and cook for about 20 minutes.\"\nCampbell also recommends adding basil and parsley to any jarred sauce before you toss it with pasta.\nTrader Giotto's is an affordable pick.\nFor a good value with high quality, Chef Nate Whiting of Charleston's Juliet recommends Trader Joe's house marinara.\n\"They use whole tomatoes and not puree. It tastes really good for how much it costs,\" Whiting told Insider.\n\"The flavor is really clean, bright, forward tomato. You can enhance the basic tomato sauce with anchovies or roasted shiitake mushrooms and pour it over braised beef or make a ragu out of it,\" he added.\nBy adding spices to canned crushed tomatoes, you can make a tasty sauce.\n\"The most common mistake with jarred pasta sauce is that really good tomato sauce has very few ingredients: tomatoes, garlic, and basil, flavor with a pinch of chili flakes and, of course, salt,\" said chef Laurence Edelman of New York's Left Bank.\nHe said it can take you around 10 minutes or so to whip up a tasty sauce with canned crushed tomatoes as a base.\n\"Saut\u00e9 some chopped garlic in extra-virgin olive oil, add some hand-crushed canned tomatoes, sprinkle in some chili flakes and some hand-torn basil, throw in a pinch of salt and you're good. Cook on low-medium for five minutes. That sauce will be infinitely better than anything you can get out of a jar,\" he added.\n- Read more:\n- I tried Olive Garden's new 'pasta pancakes,' but the new lasagna menu item looked nothing like its ads\n- I made spaghetti with meat sauce using Impossible Foods 'beef' to see if it tasted like the real thing \u2014 here's the verdict\n- Olive Garden is selling a new pass that will entitle holders to unlimited pasta for life \u2014 here's how to get one\n- A restaurant is selling pasta-stuffed sandwiches that are a carb lover's dream"

      "text": "- Getting extra protein is always a great idea if you're an active individual.\n- Cottage cheese typically has 28 grams of protein in a single cup \u2014 even the low 1% milkfat variety.\n- A large egg has 6.3 grams of protein.\n- A wide range of vegetables contains more protein than you might be expecting. For example, bean sprouts contain an estimated 13.1 grams of protein per 100 grams of sprouts.\n- Jerkies aren't just for meat-eaters anymore \u2014 vegetarian and vegan options also exist.\n- Visit INSIDER.com for more stories.\nThe National Academy of Medicine currently recommends that all adults should consume at least 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of their body weight. To calculate that based on pounds, multiply your weight by 0.36 to find the basic number if you're a sedentary person.\nIf you're more active, you need even more protein, according to Health. And if you have muscle gain or weight loss goals or you're an older adult, your protein needs may also be higher.\nWhile there are lots of protein-rich foods, some of which may surprise you or you may not have known about, it's important to get lots of protein throughout the day. Here are 13 great snacks and swaps to add to your diet.\nIf you're avoiding dairy, non-dairy brands of milk can bring a protein boost to your bowls and your cups.\nThere are several brands of protein-packed soy, nut, hemp, and pea protein-based milk available at multiple price points, in various flavors \u2014 and even with your choice of sweetened or unsweetened options if the sugar content is a concern.\nNot all of these dairy-free alternative types of milk contain the same amount of protein, according to Healthline. The protein content in different brands can also vary, so read nutrition labels carefully before making your decision.\nAdding protein-rich milk to granola for a snack or to your afternoon cup of coffee is a smart way to sneak in some extra protein.\nOn its own or in a recipe, Greek yogurt packs a big protein punch.\nSome brands of Greek yogurt can pack up to 25 grams of protein per serving, according to Eat This, Not That. But be careful \u2014 some brands can also be high in sugar, so read those ingredient labels carefully.\nWhen in doubt, grab a plain Greek yogurt and sweeten it to taste with fresh fruit and perhaps a small amount of your preferred sweetener, such as maple syrup or honey.\nSeveral types of seeds can be sprinkled throughout your meals and snacks all day long for added protein.\nChia, flaxseed, sunflower, sesame, hemp, and pumpkin seeds can go in everything from baked goods to smoothies and can be used as toppings on salads and yogurt.\nA single ounce of each of these types of seeds contains between 4.4 and 8.8 grams of protein according to Healthline, along with plenty of added nutritional benefits. Sprinkled throughout your day, that could be huge.\nProtein powders in your smoothies can make boosting your protein levels easier.\nThere are plenty of protein powders \u2014 dairy-based and vegan alike \u2014 to choose from. Again, sugar levels can be a problem if you're not careful and taste and texture vary widely as well.\nThe sheer variety of protein powders you can buy can be overwhelming, but Prevention has a great breakdown of different types to help guide you.\nBonus: Great flavors can help make sure your smoothies are never boring. With 15 or more grams of protein in a single scoop, it's a small change with potentially big benefits.\nThey may not be very glamorous, but don't underestimate the power of eggs.\nThey're a staple in many refrigerators \u2014 but it's because of that fact that they can be easy to overlook as a high-quality protein source.\nScrambled, over easy, or hard-boiled, a single large egg packs 6.3 grams of protein, according to Men's Health.\nMany cheeses \u2014 including cottage cheese \u2014 pack significant protein as well.\nMyFoodData has a handy list of 20 cheeses that are high in protein, but cottage cheese might be the clear winner, with a whopping 28 grams of protein in a single cup of the 1% milkfat variety, according to Healthline.\nIf you're vegan, you don't have to miss out on that cheesy protein tang by incorporating nutritional yeast into your diet. Omnivores and vegetarians can benefit from its delicious nutrition, as well.\nNutritional yeast has been long revered by vegans because it's packed with nutrition \u2014 including 2 grams of protein per tablespoon, according to Healthline. More importantly, if you're avoiding animal-based proteins, it is a complete protein \u2014 which is something that is more difficult to come by if you're only eating plants.\nBut it's also delicious for everyone and I dare you to make this recipe for vegan cheese sauce and not love it if you're a traditional cheese-lover. It's packed with protein and nutrients, as well as heart-healthy unsaturated fat from the olive oil, according to the Mayo Clinic.\nIf you're an omnivore or vegetarian, of course, you might not want to completely replace your beloved (and protein-packed) cheese with nutritional yeast. But you should definitely keep your options open regarding recipes that include this healthful, flavorful ingredient.\nEat protein-packed snacks like nuts, nut butter, and jerkies.\nWhether you like the crunch of a handful of nuts or you prefer to smear slices of apples or pears with tasty nut butter, incorporating these nutrient powerhouses into your diet can make a huge difference when you're looking to up your protein.\nLook for raw or dry-roasted nuts rather than ones roasted in oil for your healthiest options, registered dietitian Judy Caplan, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told Health.\nWhen scanning your nut butter options, registered dietitian Amy Lorraine recommended choosing options with the least ingredients on her blog. Many brands contain added sugar, salt, and oil, so be sure to check the ingredients list.\nJerkies are universally high in protein, but can be hit-or-miss regarding sodium and sugar levels. If you're vegetarian or interested in a healthier option, here are some jerkies for vegetarians and vegans rounded up by Epicurious.\nChickpeas aren't just for hummus \u2014 they can be a crunchy snack, too.\nChickpeas in soup, hummus, and salad are fairly easy to find \u2014 but did you know they can be crunchy, too? Baking them and then seasoning them with your favorite spice blend can turn into a high-protein, easily transportable snack, according to the Minimalist Baker.\nDry-roasting chickpeas \u2014 or other legumes \u2014 and then seasoning them yourself means you can control the fat, salt, and sugar content. Be vigilant if you buy crispy roasted chickpea snacks in stores \u2014 they can sometimes have high fat and sodium content that you may not have expected.\nEdamame, sugar snap peas, and other legumes \u2014 including peanuts \u2014 belong in your diet.\nLentils, peas, and all kinds of beans are botanically related \u2014 and are also nutrient-packed sources of vegetable-based protein. Peanuts are part of this family as well.\nHealthline has a complete breakdown of the nutritional benefits of several members of the legume family and how they can enhance your diet.\nVegetarian proteins are great, but you'll need to combine them with whole grains to make complete proteins with all nine essential amino acids, according to Today's Dietitian.\nCanned fish \u2014 including sardines and tuna \u2014 are also high in protein.\nWhen you combine canned tuna and melted cheese, the meal can bring a lot of protein to your lunch or dinner. According to SF Gate, tuna packed in oil and tuna packed in water have slightly different protein numbers.\nBesides featuring some gorgeous packaging, canned sardines also contain around 20 grams of protein per three-ounce serving according to Men's Health.\nNutritionist Lauren Antonucci even called them \"pretty much perfect.\" Portugal has raised canned sardines and tuna to an art form \u2014 and they're wrapped in beautiful packaging, are delicious, and are also incredibly healthy.\nDon't forget that quinoa, rice, and alternative types of pasta can add protein to your diet as well.\nIf you're a vegetarian or vegan who is looking to add more complete proteins to your diet, you may already know that quinoa is one of them \u2014 and if you didn't before, now you do.\nAccording to Healthline, quinoa is thought of as a grain by most of us, but it's technically a seed. With 8 grams of protein per one-cup serving and plenty of other nutrients including 58% of your RDA for manganese, it's a worthy addition to your repertoire.\nAnd while brown rice is healthier for you than white rice for a number of reasons and outshines white rice in the protein category, the numbers are closer than you might expect. According to Healthline, brown rice has 1.83 grams of protein per one-third cup when it's cooked, as opposed to 1.42 grams in the same amount of white rice.\nIf you can't live without your pasta, there's far more than just standard macaroni on store shelves, from protein-boosted traditional pasta to lentil, black bean, chickpea, and brown rice alternatives. Be sure to read nutritional labels in your pasta aisle for yet another way to get more protein into your diet.\nBonus: many of these pasta options are also gluten-free, if that's also a dietary concern.\nFinally, some vegetables contain more protein than you might anticipate.\nAccording to MyFoodData, which is a service of the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) Nutrition Facts Database, a single serving of 200 common vegetables can provide you with anywhere from 1 to 13.1 grams of protein.\nLegumes are included in this list, but so are things you might not have expected, such as broccoli, spinach, and sweet corn. Overall nutritional value can be affected by your chosen cooking methods \u2014 roasted or steamed is generally healthier than deep-fried \u2014 but the protein is there for the taking."

      "text": "In late September, the chairman of the world's largest pasta manufacturer offended people on several continents when he told a radio interviewer he would never include a gay family in his advertising.\nThough many expressed their outrage, Barilla chairman Guido Barilla's initial response to the outpouring of vitriol was a guarded non-apology clarifying that he only meant to say that \"the woman plays a central role in a family.\"\nBut even when the most impassioned moral argument falls on deaf ears, a well-targeted boycott can do the trick. A day after gay rights groups in both the U.S. and Italy called for consumers to choose pasta brands with friendlier stances toward the gay community, Barilla issued a series of mea culpas promising a dialogue civil rights leaders, and now the company has entirely reversed course.\nIn comments published yesterday by Reuters, Barilla announced it would work to make the company more diverse and said it would create an ad campaign that is more inclusive than the previous ads that depicted only traditional families.\nThe company has brought in U.S. gay activist David Mixner to participate in a new advisory board aimed at fostering diversity, and it's offering the public the opportunity to submit online videos that represent the \"multifaceted nature of pasta.\"\nGuido Barilla initiated the controversy during a September interview with Italy's Radio 24, in which he said that while he was in favor of gay marriage, he did not think gay couples should adopt a child and would not include such a couple in Barilla advertising. He also said that people who do not like Barilla's advertising could eat another brand of pasta, another suggestion for which he has since apologized."

Plenty of foods are protein-rich and easy to incorporate into your diet and your favorite recipes.\nHere are some protein-packed foods that you might want to add to your grocery list.\nBeef jerky is a protein-packed snack option.\n\"[100 grams of] beef jerky contains roughly 30 to 40 grams of protein,\" Frida Harju-Westman, an in-house nutritionist at the health app Lifesum, told INSIDER.\nHarju-Westman said she suggests reading nutrition labels carefully since each brand of jerky contains different levels of protein. She also said some variations of the snack contain additives such as sugar and salt, which you might want to avoid.\nYellowfin tuna has quite a bit of protein.\n\"With roughly 25 grams of protein per 100 grams of the fish, [yellowfin] tuna is one of the fish foods that contain the most protein,\" Harju-Westman told INSIDER.\nIn addition, she said tuna contains a decent amount of omega-3 fatty acids that are great for your heart.\nTempeh is a solid protein choice for vegans and vegetarians.\n\"Tempeh is [a] soy product that contains plenty of protein,\" Harju-Westman told INSIDER.\nMade from soybeans, tempeh is a great choice for vegans and vegetarians, as the protein doesn't come from an animal.

About 1/4 of a cup of these nuts contain 6 grams of protein at 160 calories.\nChickpeas are a great source of protein.\nAccording to the USDA, 100 grams of chickpeas contains 19 grams of protein.

      "text": "- I tried Gordon Ramsay's 10-minute pasta, which he makes for his family every week.\n- The dish has a turkey and leek sauce and is topped with crispy sage breadcrumbs.\n- Ramsay's delicious pasta was light and bright \u2014 perfect for a midweek pick-me-up.\nFrom his 15-minute Bolognese to his 10-minute bacon cheeseburger, Gordon Ramsay has never let me down when I need a fast recipe.\nSo, I was ecstatic when I learned that the Michelin-starred chef has an entire cookbook dedicated to dishes that can be made in 10 minutes flat.\nI'm always looking for quick and easy recipes to save time during the busy workweek, so I knew I had to try this pasta dish.\nGordon Ramsay makes this 10-minute pasta for his family every week.\nThis turkey and leek pasta with crispy sage breadcrumbs is featured in \"Ramsay in 10,\" which came out in October 2021.\n\"For a change, skip the Bolognese and make this creamy turkey and leek sauce in a fraction of the time instead,\" Ramsay writes in the description. \"It might just become a regular midweek family meal, as it has at my house.\"\nRamsay's 10-minute pasta includes turkey, breadcrumbs, and leeks.\nTo make Ramsay's 10-minute pasta for four, you'll need:\n- 17 ounces of fresh penne or fusilli pasta\n- 14 ounces of ground turkey\n- \u00be cup of heavy cream\n- 4 sage leaves\n- 4 regular shallots (or 2 banana shallots)\n- 3 garlic cloves\n- 2 leeks\n- 1 lemon\n- A handful of flat-leaf parsley leaves\n- Freshly grated Parmesan cheese (for serving)\nTo make the breadcrumbs for the pasta, you'll need:\n- 6 tablespoons of fresh breadcrumbs\n- 2 sage leaves\n- 2 tablespoons of olive oil\nRamsay notes in his cookbook that the breadcrumbs are optional, but I recommend taking the extra step. It was my first time making fresh breadcrumbs, and it couldn't have been easier.\nBut feel free to play around with the ingredients depending on your preferences. Ramsay said this dish also works great with ground chicken or sausage meat; the sage can easily be swapped for thyme, parsley, or tarragon; and any shape of fresh or dried pasta will do.\nBefore I started cooking, I needed to prep.\nFirst, I brought a saucepan of salted water to a boil so it'd be ready for the pasta in a few minutes.\nThen, per Ramsay's recipe, I peeled and grated my shallots and garlic. If the handheld grater proves tricky \u2014 and risky for your fingers \u2014 feel free to use a knife to finish mincing the veggies.\nAfter grating my shallots and garlic, I finely sliced my leeks.\nI should note that Ramsay recommends prepping your shallots and garlic while the olive oil is heating up in the pan and slicing your leeks right before you add the pasta. But I'm quite slow at chopping veggies, so I got my prep out of the way first so I wouldn't be stressed about burning anything. I also let my leek slices soak in a bowl of cold water to ensure they were fully clean.\nThe recipe took me a tad longer than 10 minutes, but if you're confident in your chopping speed, feel free to take Ramsay's lead.\nI also prepped my fresh breadcrumbs.\nI simply tore two slices of bread into pieces and threw them into the food processor.\nI placed my Dutch oven over medium-high heat and added two tablespoons of olive oil. Then, I added my shallots and garlic to the pan.\nI allowed the shallots and garlic to cook for two minutes, stirring regularly.\nIf you don't have a Dutch oven handy, Ramsay notes that this recipe also works with a heavy-based frying pan or a skillet.\nOnce the two minutes were up, I threw in the sage leaves and turkey.\nI broke the turkey up with a wooden spoon and allowed it to cook for three to four minutes, until the meat was lightly browned.\nWhile the turkey was cooking, I added my leeks to the boiling water.\nI let the leeks cook for one minute, per Ramsay's instructions.\nThen, I threw in the penne.\nI stirred to separate the pasta and allowed the penne to cook until it was al dente.\nSince I chose penne, my pasta didn't cook in the speedy two minutes Ramsay recommends for fusilli. But just follow the instructions on your box and the noodles will taste great.\nWhile my pasta was cooking, I added the cream to my turkey in the other pan.\nI stirred to combine everything together and allowed my sauce to come to a boil.\nI reduced the sauce to a simmer until I was ready to serve.\nDinner was almost ready!\nThen, I moved on to the crispy sage breadcrumbs.\nI placed a frying pan over medium heat and drizzled some olive oil. Then, I added two sage leaves, which I had finely chopped.\nI cooked the breadcrumbs until they were crisp and golden brown.\nThis happens very quickly, so make sure to watch the pan carefully so they don't burn.\nI drained my pasta and leeks and added the penne to the sauce.\nRamsay recommends saving two to three tablespoons of the pasta water and throwing it in the sauce as well.\nThen, I added the finely chopped parsley leaves, along with some lemon zest.\nI also added some salt and pepper before giving everything a big stir.\nI topped everything off with the sage breadcrumbs.\nAfter I added the freshly grated Parmesan cheese and drizzle of olive oil that Ramsay recommends, I stepped back and admired my pasta.\nThe dish looked bright and inviting, thanks to the pops of color from the parsley and breadcrumbs, and I loved seeing so many different textures meld together. Plus, it smelled absolutely delicious.\nIt was time to dig in.\nRamsay's 10-minute pasta took me a couple of extra minutes, but the final result was worth it.\nI don't usually go for poultry with my pasta, so I was skeptical when making the turkey sauce. But I was pleasantly surprised by how much I loved Ramsay's pasta.\nThe turkey and leek sauce is light but packed with so much flavor. The leeks add a hint of lovely sweetness, and the lemon brightens each bite. The contrasting textures of the crispy sage breadcrumbs and the creamy sauce also make a fantastic team.\nI don't usually crave a big meal on a weeknight, so I love that this pasta makes dinner interesting without being too heavy.\nWhether you're longing for a quick weeknight dish or just want a light and bright recipe, Ramsay's favorite 10-minute pasta will satisfy all your cravings."
