  "content": "Gargantuaskin maps are the second set of treasure maps to hit FFXIV: Dawntrail, allowing you to party up with your buddies and try your luck to get exclusive prizes. You'll need to decipher your Timeworn Gargantuaskin Map, find where the map points you, and you'll get a chance to find the new treasure dungeon: Vault Oneiron.\n\nThis dungeon notably drops the rare Mini Yan and Gimme Kitten minions, and the highly sought-after Yan Horn, which will give you the Yan mount. You'll have to get pretty lucky in Vault Oneiron to get your mitts on this loot, though.\n\nBelow we explain where to find Timeworn Gargantuaskin Maps in Final Fantasy 14 and where to find the treasure after you crack that map.\n\nWhere to get Timeworn Gargantuaskin Maps in FFXIV: Dawntrail\n\nYou can grab these maps randomly from any of the level 100 gathering nodes in Living Memory. The map will show up somewhat randomly, so note that it might take a few nodes before you strike one with a map. I personally like teleporting to Leynode Pyro, as there's mining outcrops that drop maps right next to the aetheryte. As a reminder, you can only dig up a map once every 18 hours.\n\nYou can also buy maps from the marketboard, but beware! Map prices can get really high depending on where we are in the patch cycle and what items were added to the rewards pool.\n\nOnce you get your map, you can select to decipher it, which will make a little square of map show up on your screen with a red \"x\" on it. You'll need to head to this location and use the \"dig\" action to get to your chest. Make sure you're partied up with some pals, as interacting with the chest will spawn enemies, and if you're lucky, a portal into Vault Oneiron. Unlike Br'aaxskin Treasure Maps, these maps will always lead you to Living Memory.\n\nAs previously mentioned, all Gargantuaskin maps will take you to Living Memory, the final Dawntrail zone. Using our map below, you should be able to look at the little sliver of map that the game gives you and align it to its correct spot.",

      "text": "Final Fantasy 14\u2019s treasure dungeons are a fun party experience and a great way to make gil and the Dawntrail expansion\u2019s br\u2019aaxskin maps are no exception. Once you use your Timeworn Br\u2019aaxskin Map, you\u2019ll need to find the treasure on one of the five available maps.\nAs usual, completing these treasure hunts with friends is a great way to grab gil and tomestones, as well as exclusive glamour materials, minions, and even currency to unlock special mounts. Lucky players will also enter portals to the Cenote Ja Ja Gural dungeon for even more loot.\nBelow we explain where to find Timeworm Br\u2019aaxskin Maps in Final Fantasy XIV and the treasure locations are once you crack that map.\nWhere to get Timeworn Br\u2019aaxskin Maps in FFXIV Dawntrail\nYou can grab br\u2019aaxskin maps from almost any of the level 100 gathering nodes in Dawntrail. Our favorite node to grab them from is the logging nodes that spawn a bit south of the Mehwahhetsoan aetheryte in Shaaloani because it\u2019s so close by and easy to grab.\nOnce you decipher the map, a little square of one of the five Dawntrail zones will show up, with a red x marking the location of the treasure. (There are no dig spots in Living Memory for these maps. It\u2019s likely that another treasure map will launch later for this zone, similarly to how ophiotauroskin maps launched during Endwalker.) You\u2019ll need to dig near the x to find the treasure.\nWith luck, a portal will pop and lead you and your party to a portal, putting you in the Cenote Ja Ja Gural dungeon. Sometimes you\u2019ll dig up treasure but you won\u2019t open a portal to the cenote. Unlucky. :(\nYou may want flying unlocked (via aether currents) in each of the zones before you set off for the sake of ease, but it\u2019s not mandatory. You can always ask a party member to caddy you around in a multi-person mount, too.\nBr\u2019aaxskin treasure locations\nBelow we mark all the known treasure locations for br\u2019aaxskin maps. You should be able to look at your little map sliver and match it up with one of ours, which have been approximately replicated. (They\u2019re not 100% exact, but they are extremely close.)\nKozama\u2019uka treasure locations\nThe dig spots for Kozama\u2019uka are pretty spread out around the map, so you\u2019ll likely want to make use of all the aetherytes.\nUrqopacha treasure locations\nMost of the dig spots for Urqopacha are on the southern half of the map, making for a mostly easy search.\nYak T\u2019el treasure locations\nA lot of the Yak T\u2019el dig spots are on the edges of the map, making them a far trek from the aetherytes, unfortunately.\nShaaloani treasure locations\nShaaloani\u2019s flat map can make it hard to spot where your dig spot is, since there aren\u2019t many landmarks provided in your given map slices, so make sure to look for the text and small ridges.\nHeritage Found treasure locations\nWhile spread out, most of Heritage Found\u2019s dig spots are pretty discernible.\nIf you\u2019re just starting out in the massive world of Final Fantasy 14, we have tons of guides to help you. We have a beginner\u2019s guide to get you started, along with guides detailing when you\u2019ll get your mount and which Grand Company you should join.\nIf you\u2019re starting but are feeling overwhelmed, we have guides to help with picking a job and a guide that explains how long it may take to catch up to current content in FFXIV.\nWe also have guides on side content, like ocean fishing, relic weapons, and Island Sanctuary, for those who want to take a break from it all."
