  "title": "Score a Free USB-C Charger When You Buy a Top-Rated EcoFlow Power Bank This Labor Day Weekend",
  "description": "Never stress about running out of a charge thanks to this sweet Labor Day deal on a handy power bank.",
  "content": "EcoFlow makes some of our favorite portable batteries and chargers. Its brand-new Rapid series includes compact, fast-charging power banks designed to keep all your devices running on the go. For Labor Day, EcoFlow is bundling in a free charger when you buy from the series.\n\nI found that EcoFlow has set up a tiered promo depending on how much you spend. If you spend at least $59 on Amazon on Rapid series products, you\u2019ll receive a free 30W EcoFlow wall charger. If you step up to $139 or more on Amazon, EcoFlow sweetens the deal with a free 65W fast charger instead. Both gifts are added automatically once you meet the spend threshold, so you\u2019re getting an essential charging accessory for free while picking up new portable power gear.\n\nEcoFlow\u2019s Rapid power banks are designed for people who want compact, fast, and reliable charging when they\u2019re away from an outlet. The lineup includes different capacities to suit different needs, whether that\u2019s keeping a smartphone alive during travel, charging a tablet between meetings, or even giving a laptop an emergency top-up.\n\nHey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.\n\nWith USB-C Power Delivery support, these packs can charge devices quickly and efficiently, which makes them stand out in a crowded market of slower, bulkier power banks. And there's no better way to take advantage of this than with a free USB-C charger included.\n\nWe like that EcoFlow isn\u2019t just another brand jumping into portable power -- the brand already has a strong reputation with their larger home backup batteries and solar generators, and this new line extends that reliability into everyday carry gear. Features like pass-through charging and high-speed output make the Rapid line practical for daily use, whether you\u2019re commuting, traveling, or working remotely.\n\nThe compact designs also mean they\u2019ll slip easily into a backpack, messenger bag or even a jacket pocket. If you\u2019re in the market for a portable charger, this promo is an especially easy way to stock up. We\u2019ve seen plenty of brands charge extra for wall adapters, but EcoFlow is bundling them in for free if you jump on the deal.\n\nThis deal stands out because EcoFlow is offering a meaningful freebie -- either a 30W or 65W fast charger -- just for buying into its new Rapid lineup. Portable batteries are always useful, but getting an extra high-quality wall charger bundled in saves you money and makes the deal much more valuable.\n\nSince these promos are tied to spending thresholds and are only live for Labor Day, it\u2019s a great time to grab one if you\u2019ve been considering a new power bank.",

      "text": "Ecoflow has been on our list of the best portable power stations for some time now. When we reviewed the Ecoflow Delta Mini, we named it the best portable power station for camping because of its combination of basic functionality, capacity and price. Unfortunately, it's been out of stock more often than not lately and has faced stiff competition from newcomers, so it shouldn't be a surprise that EcoFlow has a brand new portable power station lineup that uses its proprietary X-Core 3.0 technology that allows for faster charging speeds and higher energy appliances in a smaller, quieter form factor.\nEcoFlow River 3 Series\nEcoFlow offers the River 3 and River 3 Plus portable Gallium Nitride power stations as successors to its more entry-level River 2 series. Both are fairly compact, about 30% smaller than competitors for their capacity. The River 3 has a capacity of 245 watt-hours with dimensions of 10 by 8.1 by 4.4 inches and weighing in at 7.7 pounds.\nBy EcoFlow's estimates, it should be able to run a Wi-Fi router for 30.8 hours and a fan for 6.6 hours, giving you an idea of runtime. Two AC outlets support 300 watts total, but they can boost to 600W with something ExoFlow calls X-Boost to run higher-wattage appliances. There are also two USB-A ports, one USB-C port and a car outlet.\nThe larger EcoFlow River 3 Plus will cost you more (price still unspecified), but it'll also be more capacious to make up for it. It has a 286Wh capacity, measures 9.2 by 8.8 by 5.7 inches and weighs 9.4 pounds. You get three AC outlets that support 600W total, but it can boost to 1200W. There are also two USB-A ports, 1 USB-C port and a car outlet.\nInterestingly, the River 3 Plus battery expansion gives you up to 858Wh by adding two extra batteries that connect with Pogo Pins. The additional batteries can significantly increase the runtime depending on what you have hooked up, with a fridge lasting 1.6 hours and a 600W desktop running for 1 hour. Both power stations can double as a UPS, with the River 3 providing a 20-millisecond switchover when it detects sudden power loss and the River 3 Plus doing even better at 10 milliseconds.\nThe River 3 will be available for purchase starting September 10, while the River 3 Plus will be available for preorder starting November 1.\nEcoFlow Delta 3 Series\nThe Delta 3 and Delta 3 Plus are EcoFlow's higher-end models, meaning they'll cost more than the River 3 but likely less than the Delta Pro 3. They also have more capacity to keep you running longer and some smart features, including an app that can help manage and optimize power. With the Delta 3 Plus, you get a total capacity of 1024Wh and AC outlets rated to 1800W total, with surge to 3600W and X-Boost to 2200W. This results in heftier dimensions and more weight than the River, measuring 15.67 by 7.87 by 11.18 inches.\nWhat makes the Delta 3 especially unique is all the different ways you can charge it. Since there's an AC input outlet, you can connect it to a car charger, generator and a mix of AC and solar. The 800W alternator charger can charge it to full in 1.3 hours, while a gas generator can charge it to full in 56 minutes. Hybrid charging with AC input and attached solar panels can also top you up in 56 minutes. Like other portable power stations in the lineup, there's a built-in UPS with 10-millisecond takeover. You also have the option of adding additional batteries.\nThe Delta 3 Plus can be preordered starting September 10 and the Delta 3 on October 1.\nEcoFlow RAPID Magnetic Power Bank\nThe Magnetic Power Bank is a bit different from what EcoFlow normally offers, but it reflects iPhone users' demand for MagSafe-supported chargers. There are two RAPID-branded chargers with high-density cells, one at 5,000 milliamp hours and another at 10,000mAh. These are mostly the standard MagSafe chargers with Power Delivery 3.0 and Qi 2 certification. They'll snap to the back of your compatible iPhone, offering 15W fast wireless charging and 30W/65W cable charging with the built-in USB-C cable.\nThe 5,000mAh battery will be available immediately, while the 10,000mAh will come to market on November 1.\nEcoFlow Power Kit 5kVA 48V System\nLast but by no means least is the PowerKits power system designed for RVs that go off the grid. The system requires installation but is modular and supports different RV types, including B-Vans, Class A and fifth wheels. It has an expandable capacity of up to 45kwH and supports fast charging via alternator, solar and AC power, making it potentially incredibly useful for vanlife enthusiasts. According to EcoFlow, it should be capable of running two rooftop air conditioners and multiple high-power appliances.\nPower kits will be available for preorder starting October 15."
