      "text": "Trump\u2019s massive $500M civil fraud fine in AG Tish James\u2019 case thrown out by NY appeals court\nPresident Trump won a huge victory Thursday when a New York appeals court threw out the massive, more than $500 million fine he owed in Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 business fraud case.\nThe Appellate Division, First Department, overturned the whopping $464 million judgment that Trump, 78, faced after he was found to have fraudulently inflated his net worth by billions of dollars over a decade to get better loan and insurance terms.\nMuch of the case, brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, against Trump, however, still remains in place and will now go to New York\u2019s highest court as the legal battle between the state\u2019s top lawyer and the commander in chief continues.\nThe 323-page decision included three separate opinions, but all agreed the fine against Trump \u2014 which had grown to $515 million including interest \u2014 was \u201cexcessive.\u201d\n\u201cWhile the injunctive relief ordered by the court is well crafted to curb defendants\u2019 business culture, the court\u2019s disgorgement order, which directs that defendants pay nearly half a billion dollars to the State of New York, is an excessive fine that violates the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution,\u201d the main opinion by Judges Dianne T. Renwick and Peter H. Moulton read.\nStill, the five-judge panel kept in place a ban on Trump and his two eldest sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, from running a company in New York for several years. And the ruling kept in place an order for an outside monitor to oversee and file reports on the Trump Organization\u2019s business dealings for three years.\nThose parts of the ruling had been on hold while the appeal was decided. And Trump posted a $175 million bond in place of paying the entire judgment during the appeal process.\nSince there wasn\u2019t a majority reached in Thursday\u2019s decision, the case can automatically qualify to be heard in the Empire State\u2019s top court \u2014 the New York Court of Appeals.\nThe interest and fines against everyone in the case \u2014 including Don Jr. and Eric, and other Trump Org. execs \u2014 have ballooned to over $527 million since the February 2024 ruling from Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Arthur Engoron.\nThursday\u2019s decision was a blow to James \u2014 whose office prosecuted Trump \u2014 and to Engoron, as at least one of the appellate judges found Engoron made \u201cerrors\u201d in his rulings on the case.\nJames accused Trump and others of carrying out a \u201cstaggering fraud.\u201d But the Republican commander-in-chief maintained his innocence, claiming that he was a target of the AG\u2019s politically motivated prosecution.\nTrump lauded the ruling in two lengthy posts on Truth Social, repeating claims that the case was a \u201cpolitical witch hunt.\u201d\n\u201cTOTAL VICTORY in the FAKE New York State Attorney General Letitia James Case!,\u201d Trump posted. \u201cI greatly respect the fact that the Court had the Courage to throw out this unlawful and disgraceful Decision that was hurting Business all throughout New York State.\u201d\nMeanwhile, James, in her own statement, glossed over the fact that the judgment was vacated, also playing the decision off as a victory.\n\u201cThe First Department today affirmed the well-supported finding of the trial court; Donald Trump, his company, and two of his children are liable for fraud.\u201d\nJames said her office would appeal.\nEd Martin, Trump\u2019s political weaponization czar, called for James to step down as the Empire State\u2019s top lawyer after he launched a probe into allegations that she committed mortgage fraud on a Brooklyn townhouse and a Virginia home.\nMartin, the director of the Justice Department\u2019s Weaponization Working Group, even showed up outside James\u2019 multi-family residential property in Brooklyn last week.\n\u201cI\u2019m just happy to be on a block looking at houses,\u201d Martin told a Post reporter at the time. \u201cI\u2019m just looking at houses, interesting houses. It\u2019s an important house.\u201d\nThe appeal court\u2019s decision follows a theatrical, 11-week trial that threatened to derail Trump\u2019s image as a real estate tycoon \u2014 and brand him as a fraudster \u2014 as he campaigned to regain the White House.\nTrial evidence revealed that Trump secured cushy interest rates between 2011 and 2021 after goosing up the value of assets like his Big Apple penthouse and Mar-a-Lago estate on financial papers.\nTrump\u2019s business falsely claimed that his Trump Tower triplex was 30,000 square feet \u2014 rather than its true size of 11,000 square feet \u2014 and used the phony figures to pump up the pad\u2019s value to $327 million in 2015 after claiming it was worth $80 million just four years earlier, evidence showed.\nTrump also valued Mar-a-Lago at $517 million on a financial filing despite his own tax broker admitting to listing the palatial estate\u2019s \u201cmarket value\u201d at just $27 million in 2020, a witness revealed.\nTrump tax representative Michael Corbiciero testified that he used the lowball valuation \u2014 which is far below the estate\u2019s value if it were sold as a private home \u2014 by calling the estate a \u201csocial club,\u201d a distinction that scored Trump juicy tax breaks.\nThe deed for Mar-A-Lago bars Trump from selling the estate as anything but a social club, trial evidence shows.\nTrump nonetheless told banks and insurers that the Palm Beach estate was worth $517 million, and boasted during the trial that it was actually worth up to $1.5 billion, which would make it four times more valuable than the most expensive private home listed in the country.\n\u201cThe frauds found here leap off the page and shock the conscience,\u201d Engoron wrote in his ruling.\nThe ruling comes after some members of the five-judge appeals panel appeared skeptical in September of the merits of the lawsuit brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, which led to the trial.\nJudge Peter Moulton called the size of the penalty \u201ctroubling\u201d and questioned if the law James had used to sue Trump, which doesn\u2019t technically require someone to be \u201charmed,\u201d had \u201cmorphed into something it was not meant to do.\u201d\nThe case roiled the soon-to-be 47th president, who chose to leave the campaign trail for several days to attend the trial, calling the proceedings a \u201cpolitical witch hunt\u201d and insisting that he did \u201cnothing wrong.\u201d\nEngoron and James are both elected Democrats, and James campaigned on a promise to investigate Trump, calling the then-president a \u201ccon man\u201d and \u2033carnival barker.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s lawyers argued that the case had no \u201cvictims\u201d and that \u201csophisticated\u201d companies like Deutsche Bank did their own research before entering into the deals, and were all paid back in full.\nBut James\u2019 office argued that Trump\u2019s fudged financial filings were nonetheless harmful to the marketplace as a whole \u2014 and Engoron agreed.\n\u201cThe next group of lenders to receive bogus statements might not be so lucky,\u201d he wrote in his ruling."
