  "title": "Material Efficiency: The SMX Tool That Matches Intent with Promise",

  "content": "And this tool comes at a time when demand for it could soar. The EU has mandated 30% recycled content in PET beverage bottles. U.S. states like California and Washington are implementing their own minimum thresholds. Global brands from Coca-Cola to Unilever have pledged to increase the use of post-consumer recycled (PCR) materials across packaging and product lines.\n\nThis means premium and original brand goods can be made from their own recycled inputs, with full traceability and without compromising intellectual property or brand integrity. At the corporate level, this capability unlocks meaningful cost advantages: eliminating dependence on virgin material amid geopolitical risks, reducing insurance exposure, and meeting corporate sustainability mandates with traceable proof. In short, SMX turns reuse into an asset - not a liability - making sustainability, and circularity, not only possible, but practical and profitable.\n\nIt also makes circularity economically viable through material efficiency. SMX's technology allows companies to reintroduce their own materials - those that have already completed lifecycle one, two, three, or more-into new production cycles without sacrificing quality, performance, or brand identity.\n\nSMX doesn't shape recycling policy. But once that policy is written, it provides the tools to help make it real. Because if circularity is going to be measured, it needs a way to be seen - from the inside out. And that's exactly what SMX enables.\n\nBut even they've pointed to the disconnect: intent doesn't equal impact without real enforcement. If the world is going to regulate recycled content and close the loop on plastic, it needs systems that go beyond slogans. That's where SMX (Security Matters) (NASDAQ:SMX) enters - not as a disruptor, regulator, or judge, but as a silent partner in verification.\n\nIt's a major step forward - and one that advocacy groups like the Plastic Pollution Coalition (PPC) have long championed. Their tireless efforts to raise awareness, challenge greenwashing, and push for stronger legislation have helped shape the global conversation about plastic waste and corporate accountability.\n\nNEW YORK, NY / ACCESS Newswire / August 8, 2025 / Across industries and regions, momentum around recycling has shifted from aspiration to regulation. Governments are now setting minimum recycled content thresholds, enforcing Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) laws, and pushing for detailed audit trails-all in an effort to accelerate the shift from linear to circular economies.\n\nThis is progress-and it deserves recognition.\n\nBut as mandates expand, so do the challenges. Recycled content is notoriously difficult to audit. Paperwork can be inconsistent. Labels are often self-reported. And material flows cross continents, making traceability even harder to enforce.\n\nThat's not a failure of leadership. It's a limitation of the tools available to support it.\n\nSMX provides a way to track and trace materials at the molecular level - embedding invisible markers into plastics and other recyclables at the point of origin. These markers stay with the material throughout its lifecycle, allowing for real-time verification of where it came from, how it was processed, and whether it meets regulatory standards.\n\nIt doesn't replace regulation. It supports it - with verifiable data that can't be altered, removed, or faked. And with SMX's Plastic Cycle Token (PCT), that verification becomes more than just compliance-it becomes measurable value. The PCT enables materials with verified recycled content to be accounted for, traded, and even monetized through trusted digital infrastructure.\n\nIt's how circularity evolves from ambition to execution-and from execution to economic reward.\n\nRecycled Content Isn't a Label, It Should Be a Ledger\n\nThe Plastic Pollution Coalition is right to call out misleading claims and superficial fixes. But what they - and others - are emphasizing is the need for systems with teeth. Not more paperwork. More proof.\n\nFor governments, that means issuing certifications based on facts, not estimates. For brands, it means finally being able to support sustainability claims with embedded data - not marketing language that vanishes in the supply chain. And for consumers, it means being able to trust that \"100% recycled\" really means what it says.\n\nSMX doesn't judge the claim. It simply provides the means to prove it - or not.\n\nThat shifts recycled content from slogan to asset - verifiable, traceable, and even monetizable. And it levels the playing field by exposing gaps without assigning blame.\n\nCircularity Can't Be a Guess; It Has to Be Accountable\n\nLet's be clear: SMX isn't here to write recycling mandates or enforce them. That work is being done - by policymakers, global brands, and advocacy groups like PPC, who continue to push for systems that are measurable, not theoretical.\n\nBut success takes more than vision. It requires infrastructure. Because if recycled content is going to be regulated, it also needs to be accounted for - not just estimated. And certainly not just once at the end of a product's life, but continuously, from production to reuse.\n\nThat's where SMX technology - and its Plastic Cycle Token (PCT) - fortifies the system, turning verified circularity into something measurable, tradable, and reportable. It transforms sustainability from a promise into a performance-based asset class, grounded in verifiable truth rather than aspirational claims. With precision, accountability, and trust built directly into the product, SMX delivers the infrastructure needed to make circularity real-and make it work.\n\nAs global businesses face new and complex challenges relating to carbon neutrality and meeting new governmental and regional regulations and standards, SMX is able to offer players along the value chain access to its marking, tracking, measuring and digital platform technology to transition more successfully to a low-carbon economy.\n\nThe information in this press release includes \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

      "text": "Unilever, Coca-Cola, Nestl\u00e9, PepsiCo, and other big names have signed an open letter calling for a \u2018robust\u2019 and \u2018ambitious\u2019 plastic pollution treaty to be finalized at INC-5.2.\nAs members of the Business Coalition for a Global Plastics Treaty, over 290 businesses, financial institutions, and NGOs state in the letter that they consider harmonized regulations the \u201cmost effective way to pursue a lasting impact on plastic pollution while delivering economic, environmental and social value\u201d at a national and global level.\nAccording to the Coalition, such progress could bolster product recyclability and reusability worldwide, projecting a 77% increase in global recycled content availability by 2040.\nMismanaged waste could decline by 23% globally, the letter asserts, while twice as many \u2018problematic\u2019 and avoidable plastic products could be phased out.\nThey list phase-outs, product design, and extended producer responsibility (EPR) among the measures that, in their eyes, will ensure international consistency while bolstering the efforts of individual nations \u2013 and serving as a lower-cost option to tackling plastic pollution.\nReportedly, global cumulative EPR revenues could more than double between 2026 and 2040. Long-term decision-making for businesses could improve as the cost of capital decreases.\nThe Coalition also emphasizes potential social benefits, including stable jobs across the plastics value chain, especially in the waste management sector; improvements in public services and health among communities; and support for tourism and fishing due to cleaner environments.\nWith INC-5.2 scheduled to take place in Geneva from 5th \u2013 14th August 2025, the letter\u2019s signatories call for ambition in the upcoming treaty \u2013 aligning with The Nice Call for an Ambitious Treaty on Plastic Pollution, as agreed at the United Nations Oceans Conference in Nice, France.\n\u201cFor businesses, it\u2019s crucial to leave Geneva with, at the very least, a starting treaty that can be built upon in the future,\u201d asserted Dr. Fisk Johnson, chairman and CEO of SC Johnson.\n\u201cThe treaty should pave the way for countries to introduce well-designed Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) programmes and establish common packaging design criteria, including the elimination of hard-to-recycle plastics. Global design rules are essential for economies of scale in cost and in driving scale in circular innovation.\n\u201cAdditionally, the treaty should provide a funding mechanism to help countries in the global south improve basic waste collection. In addition, EPR can significantly increase recycling rates for plastics and promote refill and reuse systems.\n\u201cAchieving our desired circularity outcomes will require businesses, governments, and individuals to move in the same direction. A signed, implementable global treaty is a critical step forward.\u201d\nTOMRA continued: \u201cThe benefits of harmonized, global compared to fragmented regulation are manyfold and include reduced net public waste management costs, increased policy predictability, significantly improved system services like collection and recycling, increased employment opportunities, and significant reductions in mismanaged waste and problematic single-use plastics.\n\u201cIndia, in particular, is projected to benefit from a 73% increase in economic growth and a 57% increase in jobs across the value chain, a 29% decrease in mismanaged waste, 30% decrease in net public waste management cost, as well as increases in recycling rates, availability of recycled content and reductions in plastic waste and problematic single use plastics.\n\u201cTOMRA believes strongly that India will benefit from a Global Plastics Treaty and support the implementation of mandatory and harmonized regulation ahead of INC 5.2.\u201d\n\u201cWe have high expectations for the early establishment of a global plastics treaty to set harmonized rules,\u201d said Hiroshi Fujikawa, senior executive officer at Kirin Holdings Company. \u201cVaried national regulations increase corporate burden and hinder recycling efficiency.\n\u201cWithout common design rules, recycling quality and supply suffer. International frameworks enable consistent business practices, strengthen environmental efforts, and support fair competition. This treaty will empower countries like Japan to lead globally in sustainable plastic material circulation.\u201d\nGandha Wiraraharja, president director at Amcor Flexible Packaging Solutions Indonesia, commented: \u201cIndonesia is taking meaningful steps to address plastic pollution, and businesses are ready to support this transition. A global treaty with harmonised product design rules would accelerate progress. Support for implementing packaging EPR systems would further enable scalable, circular solutions across the country.\u201d\n\u201cOnly a robust treaty with harmonised regulations and common obligations will deliver a lasting impact on the plastic pollution while delivering economic, environmental and social value in Brazil,\u201d added Andr\u00e9s Gonz\u00e1lez, head of Unilever Brazil.\nAfter the last round of INC negotiations in South Korea, the French government shared a statement of ambition supported by 95 countries; we delved deeper into its call for all INC members to agree on an \u2018ambitious, universal and effective\u2019 treaty in upcoming talks.\nVarious other attendees commented on the outcome of INC-5 after its conclusion. Unilever\u2019s senior global sustainability manager, Ed Shepherd, applauded the widespread ambition on show, but expressed his concern about gaps in the current text and the ongoing risk of \u2018endless negotiations\u2019.\nEirik Lindebjerg, global plastic policy lead at WWF, also joined us on the Packaging Europe podcast to underline the questions that must be answered during INC-5.2.\nIf you liked this story, you might also enjoy:\nThe ultimate guide to the Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation in 2025\nHow are the top brands progressing on packaging sustainability?\nEverything you need to know about global packaging sustainability regulation in 2025\nThe key to increasing the use of reusable packaging in supermarkets\nNo comments yet"

      "text": "The European Commission has launched a public consultation on rules for calculating, verifying and reporting recycled content in single-use plastic (SUP) beverage bottles, including chemically-recycled content.\nThe adoption of the rules will enable chemical recycling in the EU and will help economic actors meet the ambitious recycled content targets set under the Single-Use Plastics Directive (SUPD).\nBy incentivising investments and supporting new recycling technologies, the rules will boost the competitiveness of both the EU chemical industry and manufacturers that use plastics in their production, helping to establish Europe as a leader in sustainable innovation. The measures will also benefit the environment, as they will economically incentivise producers to reuse plastic waste, rather than disposing of it in landfills, littering or incinerating it.\nThe rules are part of the new Action Plan for the EU Chemicals Industry, designed to strengthen the sector\u2019s competitiveness and drive its transition toward safe, sustainable, and innovative chemical production.\nThe EU faces increasing volumes of plastic waste, highlighting the urgent need to scale up plastic waste collection, sorting and recycling.\nTo achieve its recycling targets, the EU supports all recycling technologies that are better for the environment than incineration or landfill disposal. Among these technologies, mechanical recycling is typically preferred as it is less polluting and more energy-efficient than chemical recycling.\nHowever, when mechanical recycling is not feasible or when higher quality standards are needed, for instance for food packaging, chemical recycling provides a valuable alternative.\nThe new rules will ensure transparency in calculating the amount of chemically recycled content in new single-use plastic bottles for beverages. By setting up a clear calculation methodology, the rules will create a level playing field and provide investment security for the sector in a technology-neutral way.\nThe methodology for calculating this is based on the \u201cfuel-use excluded\u201d allocation rule, which means that waste used to produce fuels or energy recovery cannot be counted as recycled content, in line with the definition of \u201crecycling\u201d in the Waste Framework Directive.\nThe rules aim to balance transparency with minimal administrative burden for companies and national authorities. Annual third-party verification will be required for the most complex stages of the value chain, i.e. during chemical recycling.\nThe requirements will be lighter for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), with verification required every three years. Companies will be responsible for checking their business partners\u2019 self-declarations, while national authorities will conduct risk-based controls.\nThis is the first time the EU has laid out rules for chemically recycled content. The calculation methodology will serve as a model for future recycled content rules in other sectors, such as packaging, automotives and textiles. This approach is designed to give investors confidence in the long-term stability and potential of these technologies.\nNext steps\nStakeholders are invited to provide feedback on the draft implementing act on the EU\u2019s Have Your Say portal by 19 August.\nFollowing a thorough review, the Commission will present the final draft to the technical committee, made up of Member States\u2019 representatives, for a vote, with the adoption planned for autumn 2025.\nBackground\nThe SUP Directive sets ambitious recycled content targets, including 25% recycled content in SUP beverage bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) by 2025 and 30% in all SUP beverage bottles by 2030.\nThe Commission will set the rules on calculating recycled content, verification and reporting via implementing acts.\nThe Commission has adopted a two-step approach to implement these targets:\nThe first step introduces a methodology focused on the mechanical recycling of PET, based on existing food contact regulations (Implementing Decision 2023/2683).\nThe second step expands the methodology to encompass all recycling technologies, including chemical recycling, by establishing rules to calculate the proportion of recycled materials in PET bottles.\nMore information\nPublic consultation on single-use plastic beverage bottles | Have Your Say page\nDetails\n- Publication date\n- 8 July 2025\n- Author\n- Directorate-General for Environment"
