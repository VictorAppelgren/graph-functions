  "content": "The premiere episode of the latest season of Emmy award-winning \u201c takes viewers on a deeply personal journey to Clinton, Ga., where host John T. Edge was born. It\u2019s a poignant tale exploring the power of home, family and making connections through food. Here\u2019s the backstory of how it went down.\n\nLooking forward to looking back\n\nThe mission of this evocative series is to take viewers to places they\u2019ve likely never been before and to shine a light on the American South, demonstrating the rich textures of that vast region. Its irresistible hook is always the food, prepared with love and care, often at humble family-run operations that have been in business for generations.\n\nEdge, author of the best-selling and one of the founders of the Southern Foodways Alliance, makes a savvy guide. He introduces viewers to the people who share their stories, offering bite-sized glimpses into what makes this part of the world special.\n\nDuring the opening episode of Season 8, which debuts Sept. 2 on the SEC Network, the tables are turned and it\u2019s the host who shares.\n\n\u201cI felt it was important to show people a little bit more of myself, to explain why I do what I do and care so much about the place we call home,\u201d Edge explained in a recent phone interview.\n\nThe seed was first planted in Season 3, in the episode that focused on the value of family recipes.\n\n\u201cWe often talk about restaurants as second homes and it occurred to me I hadn\u2019t really talked about why I left my first home,\u201d he said. \u201cI decided to call my own bluff.\u201d\n\nWithout spilling tea and revealing spoilers, let\u2019s just say Edge had a bumpy ride while growing up. He and his father would often \u201crun away\u201d, heading down the road to eat chopped pork sandwiches at or savor the best chili dogs at . Those beloved landmarks are showcased in this episode, but not in the typical food porn fashion.\n\nOnce again, the point is gently driven home that shared meals and good conversation are an essential part of the human experience.\n\nThat\u2019s true whether you\u2019re meeting up with a genial stranger or a room full of folks who you haven\u2019t seen in 40-plus years. The latter was a reunion of sorts, with friends and former neighbors in the tiny town of Clinton.\n\nEdge said: \u201cI\u2019m not trying to explain away the chasm that divides many of us, but I do want to focus attention on the possibilities. I feel immense gratitude that I get to go home again and reconcile with my place. I think many of us want to do that, that\u2019s a very human drive. To find a way to love the people and place that loved you, to make peace, accept and love the place. At that gathering with old friends, some who I had played Little League with, I hadn\u2019t seen some of them in 45 years when I left to go to college. Not everyone is afforded the opportunity to go back home, but I was.\"\n\nHe said he was so happy he got the chance to thank the people of Jones County for showing up for him: \"I instantly felt comfortable with them and with myself.\u201d\n\nThe fitting bookends of this episode includes servings of glimpses into Edge\u2019s chosen hometown of Oxford, Miss., where he and his wife, Blair Hobbs, make the rounds, stopping at Square Books and Chicory Market. That beautifully shot footage \u2013 which features charming cameo appearances from Lurleen, the family\u2019s dog \u2013 are accompanied by original music composed by Mark Yacovone, a multi-instrumentalist from Oxford, who composed three of the songs for this episode and led the band that performed them.\n\nThe stirring soundtrack is another reason to check out this series, which is produced by . Yes, of course, there\u2019s a .\n\nBefore tuning in, it\u2019s important to note that watching True South is likely to cause hunger pangs. The deep dive into some of the cooks and managers at various locations only adds to those mouthwatering moments.\n\nJust try watching the team at Fresh Air chop pork shoulders and hams that have been cooked low-and-slow, making sandwich plates heavy with that meat alongside sides of sweet slaw and Brunswick stew and if you\u2019re a fan of that kind of fare, you might be tempted to look up flights to the nearest airport.\n\nAnd at the 109-year-old Nu-Way, loyal patrons might strike up a conversation about their preferred order before talk takes an interesting turn. That\u2019s exactly what happened during filming last May when Edge ended up sharing a meal and talking story with fellow fan, Johnny Hollingshed, Jr. \u201cPlaces like Nu-Way and Fresh Air, places that feel like a second home, showcase the possibilities of the best kind of American experience,\u201d he said.\n\nFinally, these tasty trips Edge and the True South crew have taken over the past few years inspired the author to pick up the pen again. His latest book, \u201cHouse of Smoke\u201d hits the shelves Sept. 16.\n\nIts official description reads a bit like the tone set by episode one in Season 8 of True South:\n\n\u201cThe author of The Potlikker Papers: A Food History of the Modern South tells his own story this time. Of growing up in a house wrecked by violence and a South haunted by racism. And of how his search for home led him to find escape and belonging through food. Until he realizes that gathering at the table is just one small step toward reckoning.\u201d\n\nEdge says it\u2019s easy to draw that connection, but points out the episode wasn\u2019t driven by the book: \u201cIt was really doing the show all these years that drove me to write the book.\u201d Sounds fitting. Could there be a \u201cTrue South\u201d cookbook down the road? Hope so.",

      "text": "One of the hottest home run hitters in baseball partnered with a beloved Pacific Northwest craft beer producer to come up with a brew proudly bearing his nickname. Here\u2019s why you need to raise a glass and toast the Big Dumper beer.\nHow it started\nCal Raleigh is having quite a season, making history as the first MLB catcher to crush the home run derby at the All Star game. This month, he broke long-standing records for the number of homers scored by a catcher in a season, banging out No. 50 on Aug. 25 against the San Diego Padres.\nNaturally, this kind of superstar performance has led to some cool endorsement deals, but there\u2019s one collaboration that began early in the season.\n\u201cHis management team approached us about doing a collaboration,\u201d said Phil Bannan, who runs Scuttlebutt Brewing Co., the company his parents established in 1995 in Everett, Wash., 30 minutes north of Seattle. \u201cAt first, we couldn\u2019t believe it was real. But, of course, we were so excited. We couldn\u2019t sleep at night if we hadn\u2019t gone for it.\u201d\nTurns out that Cal played for the Everett Aquasox when he was in the minor leagues, and his host family brought him to the Scuttlebutt Brewing tap house.\nA few months ago, Raleigh spent some time hanging at the brewery, getting the lowdown on various styles from the head brewer, Adam Chittick. \u201cThey talked about different grains we use and smelled different types of hops,\u201d Bannan said.\nCal leaned in one the lighter lager styles in tasting through various test batch samples and, boom! The Big Dumper beer was created. \u201cIt\u2019s a lager, but one that\u2019s got some complexity,\u201d Bannan said.\nHow it\u2019s going\nAfter launching on Aug. 15, the beer has been a huge hit, selling out quickly when it manages to making it to the shelf. \u201cOur distributors have been asking for more,\u201d Bannan said. \u201cIt\u2019s coming.\u201d\nIn the meantime, it\u2019s been nothing short of thrilling for the folks who started the family-run business nearly three decades ago. Mom and Dad and the grandson got to meet Cal on the field at T-Mobile Park and pose for a photo. \u201cHe\u2019s just such a nice guy,\u201d Bannan said.\nAnd speaking of the ballpark, if/when the Big Dumper beer ever finds its way onto the taps, it\u2019s absolutely essential it be paired with the Big Dumper dumplings.\nIf you\u2019re looking for the quintessential food partner at Scuttlebutt\u2019s waterfront restaurant, there\u2019s many options, but nothing\u2019s finer than a Big Dumper beer and an order of hand-dipped and battered Alaska cod fish and chips."

Not just a history of Southern food; it also stands as a singularly important history of the South itself.\" The Bitter Southerner\nBeginning with the pivotal role of cooks in the civil rights movement, John T. Edge narrates the region\u2019s journey from a hive of racism to a hotbed of American immigration, tracing how the food of working class Southerners has become a signature of American cuisine.\nRestaurants were battlegrounds during the civil rights movement. Access to food and ownership of traditions were key contentions on the long and fitful march toward racial equality. The Potlikker Papers begins in 1955 as black cooks and maids fuelled the Montgomery bus boycott and it concludes in 2015 as a newer South came into focus, enriched by the arrival of immigrants from Mexico, Vietnam, and many points in between.\nAlong the way, The Potlikker Papers tracks the evolution of Southern identity, from the back-to-the-land movement of the 1970s that began in the Tennessee hills to the rise of fast and convenience foods modeled on Southern staples. Edge narrates the gentrification that gained traction in North Carolina and Louisiana restaurants of the 1980s and the artisanal renaissance that reconnected farmers and cooks in the 1990s and 2000s.\nWrenching changes transformed the South over the last two generations. During that same span, Southerners transformed America. The Potlikker Papers interprets these shifts in beliefs and identities, revealing how Southern food has become a shared culinary language for the nation.\nNamed one of the best books of the year by NPR and Publishers Weekly!"
