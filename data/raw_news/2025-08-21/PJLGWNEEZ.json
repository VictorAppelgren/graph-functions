  "title": "Apple TV+ Raising Subscription Price By 30%",
  "description": "The streamer is losing over $1 billion annually, according to a March report from The Information.",
  "content": "The subscription price for Apple TV+ will increase from $9.99 per month to $12.99 for customers in the U.S. and select international markets, though it is not clear what other countries are included in the price hike. The increase will apply 30 days after users\u2019 next renewal date, according to Apple, and is effective as of Thursday for new customers. The last Apple TV+ price hike came in 2023, when the monthly subscription was raised from $6.99 to $9.99. The annual $99.99 rate for Apple TV+ is unaffected by the increase. Apple did not announce any new subscription plans alongside the price hike, meaning Apple TV+ will continue being the only streamer without an ad-suppported option.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines.

That is how much money Apple is losing annually on its streaming service, according to a March report from The Information, which noted Apple is spending around $4.5 billion a year on content. The report also claimed Apple TV+ had 45 million subscribers.\n\nWhat Other Streamers Have Raised Prices This Year?\n\nNBCUniversal\u2019s Peacock also recently upped prices for its plans by $3 a month, increasing its ad-supported plan to $10.99 and its ad-free plan to $16.99. At the start of the year, Netflix increased its ad-supported tier from $6.99 to $7.99, the ad-free tier from $15.49 to $17.99 and its premium tier from $22.99 to $24.99.\n\nApple TV+ launched in 2019 with a price of $4.99 per month. The streaming service lacked content volume compared to its competitors but has since banked on a wave of original content that has coincided with its price hikes. Shows like \u201cTed Lasso,\u201d \u201cShrinking\u201d and \u201cSeverance\u201d have become some of the streamers\u2019 top-rated shows, with the latter program\u2019s second season becoming the most-nominated show at the 2025 Emmy Awards with 27 nominations. The platform is also the exclusive home of Major League Soccer.\n\nApple is Losing Over $1 Billion a Year on Streaming Service (The Information)",
