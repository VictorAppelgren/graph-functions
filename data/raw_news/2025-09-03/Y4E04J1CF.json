  "title": "This Whoop Copycat Doesn't Gouge You With Subscriptions",
  "description": "Whoop is great for anyone that doesn't want another screen on their body, but Polar's new band is better for anyone who doesn't want to be nickel-and-dimed.",
  "content": "As great as having a fitness wearable that doesn\u2019t distract you with another screen is on paper, I bet there\u2019s one thing about gadgets like those made by Whoop that people aren\u2019t as excited about\u2014subscriptions. If you love what Whoop is putting down with its screenless fitness bands but don\u2019t want to pay another subscription in perpetuity, Polar might be there to give you just what you need.\n\nAs a part of IFA 2025, Polar announced the Polar Loop, which does what Whoop does and looks just as inoffensive on your body. The Polar Band tracks sleep, steps, activity levels, heart rate, and more, and the best part is that it doesn\u2019t charge you a monthly fee to do all of that stuff. As long as we\u2019re comparing to Whoop, though, it\u2019s only fair to note that the Polar Band does have lower battery life. While Whoop says its band can last 14 days on one charge, Polar\u2019s version lasts 8 days. That\u2019s a small price to pay for a non-recurring price from Polar, though.\n\nBoth fitness and health bands start at $199, but as I noted before, you\u2019ll have to continue paying Whoop yearly if you want to keep tracking your health and fitness, while Polar\u2019s entrant is a one-time cost. How the two compare in practice remains to be seen (we\u2019ve not used the Polar Band for ourselves), but on the surface, it\u2019s hard not to consider the Polar Band a much stronger option if you don\u2019t care to add another pricey subscription to your life.\n\nThe Polar Band is available for preorder starting Sept. 3 and is expected to ship starting Sept. 10. There are various colors, though the only ones that won\u2019t cost extra are Greige Sand, Night Black, and Brown Copper. Sorry to fans of red and blue, you\u2019ll have to pay $20 extra for your color preference!",

      "text": "We\u2019re going back to IFA in Berlin! Well, some members of the Gizmodo crew, including our consumer tech reporter, Kyle Barr, will be roaming the labyrinthine halls of the Messe Berlin to find the smartest, coolest, and weirdest consumer electronics you\u2019ll have the luxury of spending your hard-earned paychecks on in the near-ish future. The rest of the gang will be hanging back and live blogging from afar.\nExpect the usual tech giants like Lenovo and Samsung to have a big presence. If you\u2019ve ever been to IFA (it\u2019s open to the public), you\u2019ll know there\u2019s a lot to take in. You\u2019ll definitely get your steps in, walking miles just to see a new laptop or the latest robot vacuum. IFA is not quite as expansive as CES, and even though there are attendees from all over the world, nothing compares to the sardine-packed hellscape that is Sin City every January.\nEurope\u2019s largest tech show officially runs from Sept. 5 through Sept. 9, but Gizmodo will be tackling the show in the few days right after Labor Day, when many announcements drop early. Bookmark this page and Ctrl/Cmd+R often, because we\u2019ll be updating this live blog often throughout the multi-day show.\nNo AirPods Left Behind\nNotable among the sea of accessories announcing at IFA 2025 this week is this Mophie Headphones Charging Stand. It\u2019s $150, which is kinda pricey, but it does have silicone cups and a magnetic USB-C dongle for quickly dropping AirPods Max into them for a charge. The aluminum base also has a Qi wireless charger for juicing up any AirPods or AirPods Pro, or non-Apple wireless earbuds that support wireless charging.\nMophie created the ultimate AirPods charging stand that Apple should have. \u2014Raymond Wong\nThe Polar Opposite Approach to Subcriptions\nPeople love Whoop\u2019s screenless fitness bands, but one thing they don\u2019t love is paying subscriptions forever and ever. Luckily, Polar and its new Polar Loop is here for anyone who isn\u2019t okay with adding another subscription to their life. The Polar Loop does all the same stuff as Whoop\u2019s band, too, including heart rate tracking, sleep monitoring, and step counting. Sorry, Whoop, maybe it\u2019s time to soften your stance on recurring fees. \u2014James Pero\nKickin\u2019 It With Acer\u2019s Kickstand-Equipped Tablets\nAcer announced a truckload of tablets at IFA 2025. There\u2019s the $320 Iconia X12 and $350 X14, and the $300 Iconia A14 and $340 A16. I haven\u2019t any clue whether these are good tablets or not. I do know that all of them except for the Iconia X12 have kickstands. I like kickstands on my gadgets. The 12-inch Surface Pro and the Nintendo Switch 2 have very nice kickstands. But the ones on these new Acer Iconia tablets? They look more like the gumstick one on the original Nintendo Switch, though they\u2019re longer and hopefully made of more durable material. \u2014Raymond Wong\nThe Iconia A16 (left) and Iconia X14 (right) also have kickstands!\nNo kickstand on the below Iconia X12:\nUgh, Now I Need a Tape-Playing Boombox\nI love ogling gadgets, but I hate when they actually make me want to spend money. The latest source of that frustration comes courtesy of We Are Rewind, which just announced its GB-001, a next-gen boombox that plays cassettes, looks cool, and still has all the modern trappings of wireless audio devices like Bluetooth and hi-fi sound. It even has analog needles for volume and recording levels. Check out my post for the full details. I don\u2019t need this boombox, but damn do I want it. \u2014James Pero\nFor People on the Move\nreMarkable\u2019s smaller e-paper device is official, and it\u2019s called the Paper Pro Move. Get it? For people on the move who need to jot stuff down but won\u2019t do that if they need to pull out a big iPad or Paper Pro from their backpack.\nThe Paper Pro Move starts at $449 with an included Marker stylus and features a 7.3-inch color E Ink display and 64GB of internal storage. Battery life is up to two weeks, according to reMarkable.\nI\u2019ll have a full review in the coming days, but for now, here\u2019s my first impressions (including thoughts on the handwriting-to-text recognition) of the device after using it for a few days:\n\u2014Raymond Wong\nNvidia\u2019s New AI Magic Trick\nNvidia has a whole new pipeline it claims will allow anybody to create 3D objects using AI. The company\u2019s 3D object generator blueprint can generate up to 20 objects based on a single prompt. Nvidia claims the tool takes into account the theme of the project you\u2019re working on and then creates 2D images that act as previews for the potential generated 3D model. You can then export those models to most 3D applications, such as Blender.\nNvidia suggested these tools aren\u2019t built to replace 3D modelers but allow them to more easily prototype a scene or rendering with \u201clow-fidelity assets.\u201d I\u2019ve seen Adobe\u2019s AI 3D modeling suite in action going back to 2024. Those objects were not what anybody would consider high-quality. Still, if you\u2019re growing tired of the number of AI-generated 2D images flooding online art repositories, which formerly featured human-created work, we may soon find 3D model sites filling up with even more prompt-created slop.\nYou could consider Nvidia\u2019s big contribution to this year\u2019s IFA its GB10 Blackwell Superchip\u2014an AI-centric version of its latest GPU microarchitecture fueling new devices like Acer\u2019s Veriton GN100 AI Mini Workstation. It may look like a mini PC, but it\u2019s a computer specifically built to test large language models or other generative AI locally, rather than relying on cloud-based processing. Nvidia has its own similar device, the DGX Sparx, that the company teased back at CES and is currently up for reservation. Acer said its Veriton will be available to North American customers for $4,000 a pop. \u2014Kyle Barr\nHow Big Do You Like Your Screens?\nAcer\u2019s Nitro XZ403CKR is one of those monitors that makes you wonder if 5K will become more mainstream outside of creator circles. It\u2019s a 39.7-inch curved ultrawide IPS LCD display with the notorious 5K2K spec, or 5,120 x 2,160 resolution. The best part is the monitor can still hit 180Hz refresh rates at 5K. At the wide FHD resolution\u2014equivalent to 1080p\u2014you could expect 288Hz. The refresh rate may not be blisteringly fast compared to some gaming displays, but it\u2019s more than enough for most players looking to play their games at 4K at high frame rates. Acer says the XZ403CKR will be available sometime early next year with a starting price of $1,000. \u2014Kyle Barr\nThe \u2018Predator Notebook\u2019 Wants to Be the Working Nerd\u2019s Favorite Laptop\nAcer\u2019s Predator Helios 18P AI looks like many of the company\u2019s previous big and thick gaming laptops. Let me halt your yawn, because there\u2019s a twist. The device has the kind of specs and security software you expect from a big workstation laptop, but it will still bloom with heavy RGB lights under the keyboard. It\u2019s the real mullet of gaming laptops, a \u201cbusiness in the front, party in the back\u201d situation. \u2014Kyle Barr\nWell, Now There\u2019s at Least One Intel Panther Lake Device Confirmed\nIntel hasn\u2019t exactly been quiet talking about its next generation of mobile chips, dubbed Panther Lake. While we\u2019re waiting for more official specs to tell us if this is the start to the beleaguered chipmaker\u2019s redemption arc, Acer mentioned it\u2019s working on an upcoming Swift 16 AI laptop that should have the chip inside. This CPU should provide better gaming performance\u2014something that leaks suggest will be a major selling point for both small and thin laptops and maybe even handhelds. Otherwise, everything is centered on AI, AI, and AI. If you could not begin to care about on-device AI processing, the Swift 16 has an extra-large trackpad with stylus support, kind of like the company\u2019s Triton 14 AI. \u2014Kyle Barr\nAcer CEO Jason Chen Rides the 15 Feet to the Stage on a Scooter\nI\u2019m not sure why tech companies have to show they\u2019re always using tech, even if it\u2019s to move the 15 feet to start presenting its refreshed laptops. Acer CEO Jason Chen took one of the company\u2019s Predator e-scooters to the center of the stage to talk about its sustainability goals. I\u2019m not here to dive into the company\u2019s stated green goals and how the impact of global supply chains on climate change may conflict with that. At least the scooter wasn\u2019t running, because that would have been a waste of electricity.\nIf you\u2019re awake right now, you can watch along with me here. The actual hardware is still incoming. First up are Chromebooks. \u201cThe most advanced Chromebook\u201d from Acer, the Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514, features the MediaTek Kompanio Ultra chip last seen in the Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14. That processor is noticeably extra for ChromeOS, but that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. It\u2019s a convertible too, so it\u2019ll act as a tablet with an optional 2.8K OLED display. \u2014Kyle Barr\nEdit: For those of you who want a closer look at Acer\u2019s new $699 Chromebook, here it is. Here\u2019s a reminder: you don\u2019t need to stick with ChromeOS. If you\u2019re considering the open-source operating system Linux, the Chromebook Plus Spin could offer solid bang for your buck.\nAcer\u2019s Doing Acer Things\nI\u2019m here at Acer\u2019s press conference, and the PC maker is playing the music way too loud at the City Cube Innovation Stage in the Messe Berlin convention center. I have an idea of what to expect, though it may be hard to top last year\u2019s conference. In 2024, the company debuted several cool concept devices, like its deranged Dual Play gaming laptop with a controller built into the trackpad. There were other small-form gaming laptops and interesting devices like hot-swappable desktop PC SSDs. I\u2019d love more crazy gadgets, but I have a feeling this year\u2019s devices will be more humdrum. Just give me a surprise, please. Or better yet, tell me when you\u2019re finally going to launch your Acer Nitro Blaze and Blaze 11 handhelds. \u2014Kyle Barr\nIf Don Draper Went Dolby Atmos\nMarshall is back with another soundbar, and, as usual, it\u2019s leaning on some appealing mid-century design. The Heston 60 is more compact than its predecessor and maybe not as powerful, but who really cares when you\u2019ve got this smooth \u201970s cream color? Read my post below for the full details. \u2014James Pero\nGet Your Ice-Cold JBL Speaker Here\nSummer might be coming to a close, but that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have time to double-fist a beer and JBL\u2019s new Bluetooth speaker. According to JBL, its new Grip speaker is inspired by a can of seltzer. I personally think of an ice-cold beer (tallboy) when I see it, but that\u2019s just me.\nIn keeping with the seltzer inspiration, this speaker is IP68 rated, so it won\u2019t get damaged by water easily. They also come in quite a few fun colors (purple is my favorite) and have a programmable light on the back panel. The main thing with the Grip is that it\u2019s portable, so it has a loop attached that you can hook a rope through to carry on your bike or backpack, but I request that you please bike responsibly. For all the details, you can read my post below. \u2014James Pero\nEven HDR Can\u2019t Escape AI\nSome 10 years after Dolby Vision first came out to bring HDR to the masses, the audio and visual technology company is advancing things forward with *drum roll* Vision 2. And the crowd goes wild!\nHard to tell (no pun intended) whether or not Dolby Vision 2 actually brings anything noticeable to the naked eye. I mean, how many colors can you actually discern? I dunno about you, but my sight is only getting worse with age, and so too is their ability to see more shades. Who has the \u201cgolden eyes\u201d (coining this term as the visual version of \u201cgolden ears\u201d for audio) to appreciate Vision 2 to its fullest?\nOur Senior Reporter James Pero has the breakdown on what\u2019s new in Vision 2 here:\nIt mostly boils down to \u201cContent Intelligence\u201d which is jargon for using AI to adjust picture quality based on what you\u2019re watching and where you\u2019re watching. Yes, really! Then, there\u2019s also Vision 2 Max. Again, yes, really! Go read about\u2026 if you\u2019re an HDR enthusiast looking for a reason to buy a new TV with Dolby Vision 2. Or just wait for Vision 2 to come to inevitably come to an iPhone or something. \u2014Raymond Wong\nBegun, the Thin Phone War Has\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a super skinny phone that doesn\u2019t have battery compromises, you probably shouldn\u2019t get Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 Edge or Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 Air, which will be announced at Apple\u2019s \u201cAwe dropping\u201d event next week on Sept. 9. You might want to look into the Tecno POVA Slim, which is reportedly 5.95mm thin and has a 5,160mAh battery, according to tech reviewer Ben Sin.\nThe Tecno POVA Slim, launching at IFA, measures only 5.95mm but with a 5160 mAh battery. That's crucial because I don't see what's so impressive about a \"thin phone\" if the battery shrunk down. And yes I will keep this energy in September 9 pic.twitter.com/pOBsYdnX6o\n\u2014 ben sin (@bencsin) August 28, 2025\nSin shared a few images of the thin phone on X, and as you can see, it appears to have two cameras (one more than the iPhone 17 Air), but also a signature feature that Samsung ditched years ago: curved glass edges. Anything to make the phone look and feel even thinner in the hand, amirite? \u2014Raymond Wong\nA Little Light on Philips Hue at IFA\nSmart light brands Philips Hue has a few announcements planned for the next few days. Last month, the lighting fanatics over at HueBlog were keeping track of several upcoming products the company self-leaked on its own website. These include several more products for the Hue Secure line, including a long-rumored smart doorbell. Philips Hue is also reportedly planning all-new Festavia lights that look like a more permanent garland feature with a few spotlights. There are several more smart bulbs coming down the pike as well.\nThe big news may be a Hue Bridge Pro. This is a device that allows Hue devices to connect with the Matter smart home standard, which allows interoperability between several different brands. Philips Hue does not support Matter natively, as it normally only works over Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or Thread. The latter is a low-power Wi-Fi-like connection between devices that lets them communicate. According to HueBlog, Philips Hue isn\u2019t abandoning its love affair with Wi-Fi and Zigbee\u2014a separate communication protocol. However, it may be introducing some kind of radio chip that could support Thread into its latest products without having to rely on the Hue Bridge Pro. We\u2019ll know more in the coming days. Philips Hue is holding a large announcement soiree on Sept. 3. \u2014Kyle Barr\nWhat\u2019s in My Pack: IFA 2025 Edition\nI\u2019ll be in Berlin in just a few days. Already, my thoughts are burned with the memory of the Messe Berlin convention center and its utterly nonsensical layout. If you\u2019ve never had to meander those labyrinthine halls, where one can lose their sanity as fast as they lose their way, then my advice is to travel light. I\u2019m stuffing my Patagonia 55L Black Hole duffel with my usual essentials plus everything I\u2019ll need for quick capture and content creation. I\u2019m still testing the Insta360 Go Ultra, which will be especially useful for POV shots as I eat my hundredth bratwurst (and possibly shoot some wacky gadgets). Alongside a DJI Osmo Mobile 6 and a simple USB-C lavalier mic, I\u2019m packing my ancient Nikon D3400 DSLR. It\u2019s light, foolproof, and does the job. I don\u2019t have to worry much if I damage or lose it.\nFor moving between nations with different outlet dimensions, I rely on my Anker Nano Travel Adapter. My 14-inch MacBook Pro 14 with M4 will keep me company as I write these blogs, but of course you probably spotted my Nintendo Switch 2. It\u2019s sporting vinyl stickers from Dbrand as well as the company\u2019s KillSwitch case grips. I\u2019m still making use of Dbrand\u2019s travel cover, but I\u2019ve since replaced the main case with Genki\u2019s Attack Vector. That shell includes a MagSafe attachment point that lets me hook up an external battery for when the handheld inevitably dies on the plane. We\u2019ll find out if I\u2019ll have any time to relax to play it or read more of Micaiah Johnson\u2019s Those Beyond the Wall. \u2014Kyle Barr\nWhat\u2019s DJI Bringing to IFA?\nDJI, the company you likely most associate with drones, has a few new products on its plate that have little to do with UAVs. We expect the China-based company to offer us a look at its new $220 Mic 3. This is a compact wireless microphone setup that\u2019s best described as a cross between the company\u2019s Mic mini and Mic 2. Each of the pack\u2019s two mics weighs in at just 16 grams\u2014half that of the DJI Mic 2\u2014though you can still adjust the transmitter\u2019s orientation. It can now support up to four transmitters and eight receivers at once, in case you want to capture an entire podcast debate that hopefully won\u2019t go viral for all the wrong reasons. In addition, new leaks suggest DJI is planning on producing a new action camera with a magnetic lens pod \u00e0 la the Insta360 Go 3S.\n\ud83d\udc49Here is our little Osmo Nano, which is set to compete with Go Ultra.\n\u2705Built-in memory 64 GB / 128 GB\n\u2705OLED touchscreen for one-handed control.\n\u2705Charges from the module to 80% in just 20 minutes.\n\u2705SD card slot\n\u2705Magnetic body for mounting anywhere#osmonano pic.twitter.com/12tvl5ZMDf\u2014 Igor Bogdanov (@Quadro_News) August 28, 2025\nWe\u2019ll have to wait and see what actually shows up at the DJI IFA booth come Sept. 5. \u2014Kyle Barr\nreMarkably Mini?\nreMarkable\u2019s e-paper tablets have gained something of a cult following. People who use them love them to death. It\u2019s not hard to see why\u2014writing on the slim displays is closer to pen and paper than an iPad and Apple Pencil.\nThe company has started teasing \u201csomething\u201d that\u2019s \u201con the move.\u201d Speculation is that it\u2019ll be a mini version of the Paper Pro. It better have a color e-paper display or else. \u2014Raymond Wong\nSamsung Teases New Galaxy Tab\nSamsung is doing its own virtual Unpacked event on Sept. 4 to announce a new Galaxy Tab. Most likely refreshed versions of the Galaxy Tab S10+ and Tab S10 Ultra. Anybody wanna take bets on the name? I\u2019m going with Galaxy Tab S11+ and Tab S11 Ultra.\nAs for what to expect from the tablets. Well, they\u2019ll run Android and likely with Samsung\u2019s own One UI 8 interface. More Galaxy AI features are a safe bet. Ditto for Google Gemini integration. AI, AI, AI\u2014you know?\nThe Tab S10 Ultra had a gargantuan 14.6-inch display. I say go bigger or go home. Give us a 16- or 18-inch tablet that dwarfs even the biggest 12.9-inch M4 iPad Pro. Why the hell not? \u2014Raymond Wong"

      "text": "At some point in the late 2010s, I became obsessed with my heart rate. I was at a point in my fitness life that I was training for marathons and I cared a whole lot about every process involved. I spent a certain percentage of my workday staring at my heart rate on my fitness watch and feeling smug if I kept my resting heart rate below 50 beats per minute (bpm) and wigging out if it went over 60 bpm. Heart rate was my gateway drug into health tracking, and it soon devolved into an unhinged compulsion.\nA couple of years in, for the sake of my mental health, I stopped tracking everything. It was liberating and freeing. Around this time, the Whoop\u2014a fitness tracker that passively monitors heart rate, sleep, and stress, among many other things\u2014started gaining popularity among elite and amateur athletes and other fitness enthusiasts. I tried it for a month or two, but stopped, in an attempt to remain committed to the no-fitness-tracking bit. In the meantime, Whoop has now become a fixture in the fitness space and has gone through five iterations. The latest, the Whoop 5.0 starting at $199 annually (includes a subscription), was released in May. The screenless band is a significant upgrade from earlier models, and is Whoop\u2019s most committed attempt at putting itself in the growing longevity and anti-aging space.\nWhoop 5.0\nIf you are serious about health tracking, Whoop 5.0 has everything you could ever want. But for most people, it might be too much information.\nPros\n- Sensor tracks a ton of useful data\n- Long battery life\n- Easy setup\n- No distracting display\nCons\n- Might be too much data for casuals\n- Requires a yearly subscription\n- Uncomfortable for tiny wrists\nThese days, I usually (but not always) use a fitness watch (either an Apple Watch or a Garmin) to track my pace or mileage when I run, but I don\u2019t wear it 24/7. I finally forced myself out of my retirement and dove head first back into the deep waters of health tracking with Whoop 5.0. I was so not ready.\nA Subscription Is Required\nHistorically, fitness trackers have hinged on the ability to see whatever health stat they\u2019re tracking\u2014step count, heart rate, etc.\u2014effortlessly on the device itself. The pedometer, the OG fitness tracker, for instance, was just one big number display. Heart rate monitors embedded in smartwatches clearly revealed accurate, up-to-date measurements. And no decent fitness watch couldn\u2019t easily display a runner\u2019s current pace and distance.\nWhoop takes a different approach. The hardware has no display. It contains PPG (photoplethysmography) sensors that use infrared light, which is absorbed by hemoglobin in the blood, to capture changes in blood volume and generate an incredibly accurate estimate of a person\u2019s heart rate as well as their heart rate variability (the variation in time between heartbeats). Like other fitness trackers, it also contains skin temperature sensors to detect sleep and accelerometers to capture activity.\nWhoop uses this tech tracking to go all in on the software side of things, and all of that is embedded in the Whoop app. And that brings up a key difference between costs when you compare a Whoop to a traditional fitness tracker like a Fitbit or Garmin watch. Often, a fitness tracker is a one-time purchase kind of deal: you buy the device, you download the accompanying (often free) app, and aside from upgrading the software from time to time, you are set. Whoop works on a membership structure, which has changed over the years, but currently, it uses tiered subscription plans. With the new Whoop 5.0, $199 gets you the band and a Whoop One subscription, which provides sleep, strain, and recovery insights, personalized coaching, VO2 Max and heart rate zones, and women\u2019s hormonal insights. The Whoop Peak plan, at $239 per year, adds healthspan and pace of aging, health monitor with health alerts, and real-time stress monitoring. Finally, Whoop Life, at $359 per year, has its own band\u2014the Whoop Peak (different from the Whoop 5.0)\u2014which allows for monitoring blood pressure, though this is still in beta testing, as well as electrocardiogram (ECG) readings and irregular heart rhythm notifications.\nWhat It\u2019s Like to Wear and Use\nThe key aspect of a Whoop is that in order to unlock all of the benefits listed above, you must wear it 24/7. Literally. You cannot take it off. Not even for a shower. In fact, if you do deign to take a break, the Whoop app will send consistent and persistent notifications that you are slacking off, and it won\u2019t be able to obtain the most accurate results it can without you wearing it.\nI found this aspect difficult, especially in the first week. I didn\u2019t love having to wear it all the time, especially after a hot, humid summer workout. And in general, I don\u2019t find the Whoop 5.0 band to be all that comfortable. Getting the band on is also not intuitive. You have to lift the metal buckle up, then slide it onto your wrist. If you don\u2019t, from experience, it will be almost impossible to wrangle it onto your wrist\u2014to the point where you probably won\u2019t want to ever take it off. I remember all of these issues from a few years ago when I tried the Whoop 2.0, which felt completely too large for my tiny wrist.\nSometimes I would find it so uncomfortable in the middle of the night that, in a sleep stupor, I would take it off without even realizing I was doing so. (While I am not the majority here, I am also not the only person to find the Whoop band uncomfortable.) Technically, you can wear the band on your bicep, too, and it still provides accurate measurements, but I didn\u2019t find that to be all that comfortable either, and a bicep fitness band isn\u2019t the vibe I personally always want to be going for (though never ever any judgment, of course).\nWearing it did get easier as the days went on, and compared to the earlier version of Whoop I tried and the 4.0, the 5.0 sensor is smaller. The smaller size did seem to make it more comfortable. Without a screen of any kind, the battery life is amazing; my Whoop 5.0 lasted a full 12 days of continued use (and it only takes a couple hours to recharge). There are two ways to charge the Whoop 5.0. A basic charger that plugs right into a USB-C will juice up the device in 152 minutes, while a wireless power pack attaches to the device on your wrist and will charge the device in 110 minutes (according to Whoop) without needing to actually take the Whoop off (they really do want you to keep it on forever).\nSo Much Data It Can Be Overwhelming Sometimes\nIf you wear the Whoop 5.0 all the time as prescribed, the device does give you a cool window into your health. But it takes time. During the first couple of days to weeks, it is in a kind of calibration mode where it needs time to gather more and more data about your body. But by two weeks in, it gives you a more detailed sleep analysis as well as a strain, sleep, and recovery score. By three weeks in, if you have the Peak Plan, you\u2019ll access healthspan, which gives you a biological age score, among other things.\nTo be honest, I found a lot of this information both over and underwhelming. The sheer amount of it all can feel very daunting to look at, especially if you don\u2019t have a lot of time carved out in the day to devote to digesting it all. Additionally, as I alluded to earlier, having come from a solid break from health tracking, I found I wasn\u2019t sure I needed or wanted all of this information again. For example, when it comes to sleep analysis, I pretty much knew, without having to look at the Whoop app, if I had a good night of sleep or not.\nPerhaps Whoop\u2019s biggest selling point, especially from a fitness perspective, is its strain score, which uses a variety of factors, including your exertion and recovery, to give you a daily number, which varies from 1 to 21. Each day\u2019s score will not only reflect the amount of physical activity you did, but also how much sleep, for example, you got the night before. That is perhaps the part that I did find most fun and addicting. And I would surmise if I were training for something like a marathon or starting or maintaining a weight-lifting program\u2014and was serious about it\u2014that\u2019s where the Whoop 5.0 would come in most handy.\nWill the Whoop 5.0 Help Me Live to 100?\nThe premise of Whoop is that you should continue to wear the sensor 24/7 and, in doing so, you continue to know your body better and better over time AND are able to use the data to live a healthier life. And there are plenty of devoted Whoop users who do this. But how that translates into better health is far murkier. Very few studies have been done that investigated a connection between wearing the Whoop and gaining better health or fitness metrics. And the ones that have been done\u2014including this study, published in April in the journal Sensors, which found that wearing the Whoop consistently was associated with a lower resting heart rate and a higher heart rate variability as well as better sleep and activity metrics\u2014were funded by Whoop itself.\n\u201cThese findings provide compelling initial evidence that consistent engagement with Whoop is linked to physiological and behavioral benefits,\u201d the study authors concluded. The results were based on long-term data from more than 10,000 users. This brings up another inherent difficulty in studying these devices, and that\u2019s that the population of people who choose to use a device like Whoop are typically those who are already heavily invested in improving their health. That makes it difficult to tease apart which improvements were from wearing the Whoop consistently and which ones were from being a health-conscious person who will choose a lifestyle that is good for their health.\nThat aside, there is something to be said for wearing a device that passively tracks numerous health metrics without having to think about them every time you look down at your wrist. And you can\u2019t really get that on any other fitness device. Even if you don\u2019t utilize all of the health metrics Whoop offers, it could still be worth it to get insight into your health without having your heart rate staring at you in your face every time you look at your wrist."

      "text": "Whoop has always been a wearable marketed to the most hardcore of athletes. It\u2019s been seen on the wrists of athletes in the NBA and other pro sports leagues, which is fitting, because it\u2019s designed to maximize training. Personally, I\u2019ve always been hung up on one thing: I don\u2019t want to wear something on my wrist that can\u2019t even tell me the time of day. Call me old-fashioned, but it\u2019s true.\nBut Whoop just released the fourth generation of its popular wristband, which is 33% smaller than its predecessor and also has more sensors, so I figured it was finally time to give this thing a whirl. It turns out it gets a lot of things right.\nWhoop 4.0\n-\nWhat is it?\nA wearable without a screen that is laser-focused on your strain and recovery levels\n-\nPrice\n$30/month (or $18/month if you sign up for 18 months)\n-\nLike\nLow-profile, waterproof, does a good job of monitoring your heart rate, and has the best charging solution of any wearable I\u2019ve tested.\n-\nDon't like\nIt doesn\u2019t have a display, it doesn\u2019t really track anything other than Strain, Sleep, and Recovery, and it is too often inaccurate with those metrics.\nNo Screen, Just Band\nWhoop has always been unique in the world of wearables. For starters, it\u2019s not something you can just buy. Instead, it\u2019s a service you pay for: $30 a month, though it can be as cheap as $18 a month if you buy in an 18-month chunk, and the company sends you the band for free. This means that if you\u2019ve been using Whoop for years, they\u2019ll just send you a 4.0 band to replace your 3.0, and the new band doesn\u2019t cost any more than the old one.\nThe Whoop 4.0 has a sleeker design than prior versions. At two-thirds the size of the 3.0, it\u2019s noticeably less prominent and more comfortable when it\u2019s on your wrist. It also claims to be the first to use a new type of battery from Sila, which has a silicone anode that boasts 17% more energy density. So, despite being smaller, the 4.0 still promises five-day battery life (though I found that sometimes it would only make it four days).\nThe way the Whoop recharges is extremely slick. It has a small battery pack that you just slip onto the Whoop while it\u2019s on your wrist, so you basically don\u2019t ever have to take it off and you don\u2019t end up with any gaps in your data. The charger for the 4.0 is now waterproof, so you can shower or swim with it while charging if you want (or if you forget). It\u2019s a very clever system.\nThe Whoop is generally worn on your wrist like a watch, but there is now a line of clothing called Whoop Body. This is a collection of shirts, shorts, bras, underwear, and bands that allow you to wear the sensor elsewhere on your body. Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to test these, so the Whoop 4.0 stayed on my wrist for a month, and I found it to generally be comfortable. It\u2019s fairly low-profile, so it didn\u2019t catch on my sleeves very often, and the woven, stretchy band is soft to the touch, though it does take a little while to dry, which caused some damp cuffs.\nWhat Whoop Tracks\nThe band doesn\u2019t have an accelerometer to count your steps or an altimeter to count the flights of stairs you ascend every day. Whoop neither knows nor cares about such trivial frivolities! It does, however, pay a lot of attention to your heart. The 4.0 band now has five LED lights (three green, one red, and one infrared) up from two in the previous generation, and it now has four photodiodes, up from one.\nUsing all the data the comes from those sensors, the Whoop platform is really only interested in two things: Your strain level and your recovery level (and your sleep, but that\u2019s effectively part of your recovery). Your strain score is, essentially, how hard your heart had to work. When you do a workout, manual labor, or anything that gets your heart pumping, the band keeps track of your pulse. Afterward, you\u2019ll see a strain score for that specific activity in the app. All of this is cumulative, and you also get a strain score for your entire day, which is on a scale from zero to 21, for some reason. Each day when you wake up the app will give you a recommended amount of strain to aim for based on how you\u2019ve recovered from your last bout of strain.\nRecovery is the other big thing Whoop looks at, and it examines how much rest you\u2019ve gotten post-strain. As you might expect, the main way to recover is to sleep. Each evening Whoop gives you a notification about how much sleep it thinks you need to fully rest and get yourself a recovery score of 100. (Yes, the strain score is from 0-21 and recovery is 0-100 and no I don\u2019t know why.) The band estimates when you\u2019ve fallen asleep and when you wake up, and it does so with very solid accuracy, in my experience. While you\u2019re sleeping it monitors your pulse, as well as heart rate variability (HRV), respiration rate, and blood oxygen levels. When you wake up, it gives you a sleep score and tells you how you\u2019ve recovered\u2014or how well it thinks you\u2019ve recovered, anyway.\nNot Exactly Accurate\nOver the years I\u2019ve had various friends and colleagues get somewhat obsessed with their Whoop scores, so I was excited to finally try it out for myself. The results were interesting, but they left me underwhelmed. I found Whoop\u2019s strain metric to be somewhat inconsistent. You start off with a zero when you wake up, but I found that on many mornings it gave me a score in the low 4s before I had done anything beyond make myself breakfast (which definitely did not spike my heart rate). It seemed to work pretty well for cardio, and my strain score would scale up as expected on longer/harder runs, but Whoop doesn\u2019t really know what to do with strength training. Doing bodyweight exercises and lifting weights is an important part of training for a lot of people, but it barely registers on the Whoop because it doesn\u2019t cause your heart rate to spike like longer-duration cardio does. This could leave you with exhausted, twitching muscles but still a very low strain score.\nI checked the Whoop against a chest strap heart rate monitor and against other wearables, and generally the heart rate was accurate, though there were instances where my reading would just drop out unexpectedly, as you can see from these random sharp valleys in this run I recorded.\nBasically, I would put it on par with other current generation wearables from companies such as Polar, Suunto, and Garmin, but not above.\nI had issues with the way the Whoop scores sleep and recovery, too. Sometimes my recovery score would match the way I felt in the morning, i.e. the band gave me a 75, and subjectively, yes, I felt like I was at about 75%. Other times it was inexplicably way off, and that could happen in either direction. After a very poor night of sleep, it informed me that I was well into the 80s in my recovery and primed for a day full of strain. I was exhausted and felt like a husk of myself. Another time it rated my recovery as way down in the 50s, but I actually felt great and was ready to put some work in. I did some digging, and I think the problem may be that Whoop weighs your heart rate variability (HRV) much more than it does that actual duration or quality of your sleep. HRV is certainly an important metric, but people who are in good shape typically have higher rates of HRV (which is a good thing), and I think that may skew the numbers.\nWhoop vs. Garmin\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that while Whoop may have been the first to really laser focus on recovery, it\u2019s not the only wearable that does so now. Garmin, for instance, has a metric called Body Battery, which is effectively the same thing as Whoop\u2019s recovery score, and I found it to be slightly more accurate compared to how I actually felt, subjectively. Garmin doesn\u2019t make this number as prominent as Whoop does, but it\u2019s right there for you if you want it.\nAnd that brings us to the crux of the issue here. The entire time I wore the Whoop 4.0\u2014more than a month\u2014I also wore a Garmin watch called the Enduro. The Enduro does everything the Whoop can do, but it can also do so, so much more. Steps and altimeter? Check. Track all kinds of different indoor and outdoor sports/activities from lap-swimming to snowboarding? Yep. Do it all with GPS and the ability to show me the weather and phone notifications? Yessir. Contactless payments? Sure. And last, but not least, I don\u2019t have to pull out my phone to find out what\u2019s going on. If I want to see my heart rate in real time, I can just look at my wrist. If I want to set an alarm, I can do it on my wrist. If I want to know the flipping time and date, or my Body Battery level, or the number of calories I\u2019ve burned today, it\u2019s all right there. Several weeks of battery life? That, too. Now, the Enduro is not a cheap watch, costing around $800, but Garmin makes much cheaper multi-sport watches that do basically all of that and those watches are liable to last you many years. With Whoop costing around $30 a month, the cost would very likely become comparable in just a couple years.\nThe most important bit is that the Garmin can fully replace the Whoop, but the Whoop can\u2019t at all replace the Garmin. Even if I really loved the Whoop (and I sort of did at times), I\u2019d still want to have the Garmin on for basically any activity that I did, and wearing two watch-sized wearables is just a non-starter for me. It looks like I\u2019m in geek-shackles.\nWorth Buying?\nThe Whoop 4.0 isn\u2019t \u201cbad,\u201d it\u2019s just limited. It is good to see it evolve and do things the 3.0 couldn\u2019t. For instance, if your blood oxygen suddenly drops below safe levels (which could be a sign of a real health problem, such as a covid-19 infection), it can alert you. When I got my Moderna booster shot, I woke up the next day to an alert that said my HRV had dropped, my skin temperature had risen above my average, and my recovery was very low. Yep, I felt like crap for a day. Also new in the 4.0 is a vibrating motor which you can use to set a silent alarm. You can set it to a specific time, a \u201csleep goal,\u201d or when the Whoop senses that you\u2019re in the green (i.e. you\u2019ve reached a good level of recovery). I do not recommend that last one, as it woke me up an hour earlier than I\u2019d hoped and I was still completely exhausted.\nWhoop\u2019s goals in and of themselves are good. The idea of calculating strain and recovery (and sleep) so you know how hard to push on any given day makes sense. The problem is that the Whoop 4.0 doesn\u2019t absolutely nail this, and considering that\u2019s really the only thing that it does, it needs to be effectively perfect. In contrast, there are tons of sports watches out there who do about as good of a job at addressing the strain/recovery equation, but then also do so much more. A good multi-sport watch just makes more sense for virtually everybody."

  "argos_summary": "Polar Loop, a subscription\u2011free fitness band unveiled at IFA 2025, offers 24/7 heart\u2011rate, sleep, and activity tracking without a monthly fee, contrasting with Whoop\u2019s screenless band that requires a yearly subscription. The Loop has an 8\u2011day battery life and a one\u2011time $199 price, but its smaller battery and lack of advanced health metrics may limit appeal compared to Whoop\u2019s 12\u2011day battery and subscription\u2011based data insights. Polar positions the Loop as a simpler, cost\u2011effective alternative for users who dislike recurring fees, while Whoop targets hardcore athletes seeking detailed strain and recovery analytics. The launch coincides with IFA\u2019s broader focus on wearable tech, but the Loop\u2019s market impact will depend on consumer preference for subscription models versus upfront costs.",
