      "summary": "Wall Street's main indexes closed flat, with the S&P 500 reaching a record high, despite a significant rise in producer price inflation that dampened expectations for future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Companies like Deere and Tapestry saw their stocks drop sharply due to lower profit forecasts linked to tariffs. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market experienced a downturn following the inflation report, although there remains optimism for institutional adoption in the sector.",
