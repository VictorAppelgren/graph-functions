  "title": "Taylor Swift announces new album after surprise midnight countdown",
  "description": "Swift revealed plans for her 12th studio album, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d at 12:12 a.m. ET on Aug. 12, in a clip recorded on her boyfriend Travis Kelce\u2019s podcast.",
  "content": "It\u2019s 12:12 a.m. Eastern time on Aug. 12: In Taylor Swift\u2019s universe, that could only mean one thing. \u201cSo I wanted to show you something,\u201d Swift said in a short clip posted to her Instagram account first thing Tuesday morning. In the video, she sat next to her boyfriend, NFL star Travis Kelce, as she recorded an episode of his podcast, \u201cNew Heights,\u201d that he hosts with his brother, former NFL star Jason Kelce. Swift unlocked a mint green briefcase with an orange \u201cT.S.\u201d emblazoned on the front, and pulled out what looked like a blurred-out vinyl record.\n\nThe news of Swift\u2019s 12th album came after a frenzied day in the Swift fandom, which has been eagerly awaiting a full-length record ever since the megastar wrapped up the Eras Tour in December. It became the highest-grossing tour in history.\n\nOn Monday morning, increasingly loud rumors of a new Swift project exploded when \u201cNew Heights\u201d released a teaser that promised a \u201cVERY special guest\u201d on Wednesday\u2019s upcoming episode, with a silhouette that looked like Swift against an orange background next to the Kelce brothers. Twelve minutes later, Swift\u2019s official fan account Taylor Nation posted a reference to when Swift wrote \u201cSee you next era \u2026\u201d in her Eras Tour book released in November, and included 12 photos of Swift in orange outfits.\n\nAll of the 12s, combined with all of the orange, plus the fact that Wednesday will be Aug. 13 (Swift\u2019s lucky number) was simply too much for her fiercely loyal fan community to handle. Although Swifties joke about \u201cclowning\u201d when they analyze Swift\u2019s every word and photo pixel for clues about her music that aren\u2019t actually clues, this time, they were correct: Swift was about to make her debut appearance on the podcast, and there was a 12th album on the way.\n\nOn Monday night, about 12 hours after those initial hints, Swift\u2019s website suddenly transformed into a sparkly orange background with a message: EXPIRES AUGUST 12 at 12:12 a.m. Eastern time. Then, the \u201cNew Heights\u201d team increased the hype and dropped a preview clip that showed Swift sitting down to record the podcast, wearing headphones as she and Kelce grinned at each other.\n\nThis marks the first time that the public has ever seen Swift and Kelce, who have been dating for about two years amid worldwide media attention, have a conversation \u2014 so there\u2019s no telling how the Swifties will handle the full episode later in the week. At exactly 12:12 a.m., the podcast published the video of Swift sharing the album announcement, and her website transformed into a page where fans can \u201cpre pre-order\u201d the album, which has an unknown release date.\n\nUntil now, Swift has had a more low-key year than usual. After the Eras Tour wrapped at the end of 2024, which spanned nearly two years and grossed $2 billion from 149 sold-out stadium shows, Swift disappeared from public view for a bit. But she didn\u2019t remain completely out of the spotlight: She showed up to cheer on Kelce in several playoff games as well as the 2025 Super Bowl, which the Kansas City Chiefs lost to the Philadelphia Eagles, 40-22. In the following months, she and Kelce were photographed out together in various places (New York City, Florida, a suburb of Cleveland not far from where Kelce grew up) and she made a surprise cameo at a concert during his annual \u201cTight End University\u201d NFL summit in Nashville to perform \u201cShake It Off.\u201d\n\nAt the end of May, Swift dropped a piece of bombshell news: After a years-long fight to own her master recordings from her first six albums (sold to manager Scooter Braun and then a private equity company), she had bought her entire musical catalogue for somewhere in the neighborhood of a reported $360 million. She revealed that her \u201cTaylor\u2019s Version\u201d project \u2014 in which she rerecorded four of her first six albums to devalue Braun\u2019s purchase \u2014 was on hold for the time being, although she may rerelease her debut country album at some point if there\u2019s enough demand.\n\nThat detail sent Swifties into a frenzy, who started wondering if Swift, who doesn\u2019t like to have free time for too long, had new music in the works. Her last album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d was released in April 2024 and was the highest-selling record of the year, earning nearly 7 million equivalent album units, according to Billboard.",

      "text": "Taylor Swift\u2019s \u2018Tortured Poets Department\u2019 Is Luminate\u2019s Top Album of 2024 in U.S.\nIt's the third time Swift has led Luminate's year-end list. She was also tops with \"1989\" (in 2014) and \"Fearless\" (in 2009).\nTaylor Swift\u2019s The Tortured Poets Department finished 2024 as the most popular album of the year in the U.S., according to music data tracking company Luminate. Meanwhile, the most-streamed song by on-demand audio streams was Shaboozey\u2019s \u201cA Bar Song (Tipsy),\u201d and the most-heard song on the radio was Teddy Swims\u2019 \u201cLose Control.\u201d\nTotal music consumption in the U.S. \u2013 as measured in audio equivalent album units \u2013 increased by 5.6% in 2024. (View Luminate\u2019s 2024 Year-End Music Report.)\nSee Luminate\u2019s year-end top 10 albums, along with other year-end rankings and industry volume numbers, below.\nBut first, the fine print:\nEquivalent album units \u2013 for album titles and chart rankings cited below (but not industry volume numbers) \u2013 comprise traditional album sales, track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album, or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio and video streams generated by songs from an album. Album titles and album chart rankings by equivalent album units do not include user-generated content (UGC) streams, but UGC streams are included in Luminate\u2019s industry volume numbers. (UGC streams are not factored into any of Billboard\u2019s weekly charts.)\nFor the sake of clarity, equivalent album units do not include listening to music on broadcast radio or digital radio broadcasts \u2013 including programmed streams \u2013 operating under Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) regulations. All numbers cited in this story are rounded, and reflect U.S. consumption only.\nLuminate\u2019s equivalent album unit totals include SEA and TEA for an album\u2019s songs registered before an album\u2019s release, but during the tracking period of Dec. 29, 2023, through Jan. 2, 2025.\nLuminate began tracking music sales in 1991 when the company was known as SoundScan. Luminate\u2019s sales, streaming and airplay data is used to compile Billboard\u2019s weekly charts. Luminate\u2019s 2024 tracking year ran from Dec. 29, 2023, through Jan. 2, 2025.\nLuminate\u2019s 2024 tracking year contained 53 weeks, instead of the usual 52 weeks. So, for 2024 volume comparisons to 2023, a corresponding 53-week period was used by Luminate for 2023: Dec. 30, 2022, through Jan. 4, 2024.\nHighlights from Luminate\u2019s 2024 U.S. year-end data:\n- Taylor Swift\u2019s The Tortured Poets Department was Luminate\u2019s top album of 2024 in the U.S. It\u2019s the third time Swift has led the year-end list. She was also tops with 1989 (in 2014) and Fearless (in 2009).\n- Poets earned 6.955 million equivalent album units in 2024 in the U.S., according to Luminate. That\u2019s the biggest yearly total for an album since 2015, when Adele\u2019s third album, 25, earned 8.008 million units.\n- Swift is the first artist in Luminate history (1991-present) to have three different albums be a year-end No. 1.\n- Poets was also the top-selling album overall in the U.S. in 2024, by traditional album sales. It was also the top-selling album in each of CD, vinyl and cassette tape formats, as well as among digital download albums.\n- Total U.S. audio album consumption increased 5.6% in 2024.\n- U.S. on-demand audio streams increased 6.4% in 2024.\n- Shaboozey\u2019s \u201cA Bar Song (Tipsy)\u201d was the most-streamed song in the U.S. in 2024 by on-demand audio streams: 912.7 million.\n- U.S. vinyl album sales increased by 4.3% in 2024.\n- Seven of the year\u2019s top 10-selling albums were K-pop projects.\n- Digital track sales declined for a 12th year in a row in the U.S. in 2024.\n- Teddy Swims\u2019 \u201cLose Control\u201d was the biggest song at U.S. radio in 2024: 3.250 billion audience impressions.\nSwift\u2019s The Tortured Poets Department debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart dated May 4, 2024, and has spent 17 nonconsecutive weeks atop the tally (through its most recent week at No. 1 on the chart dated Dec. 21). The last album by a woman to spend as many weeks at No. 1 was Adele\u2019s 21, which earned 24 nonconsecutive weeks on top in 2011-12.\nPoets is the third Swift album to be named Luminate\u2019s year-end No. 1 album, following 1989 (2014) and Fearless (2009). In both 2014 and 2009, the year-end list was based solely on traditional album sales. In 2015, the year-end ranking started being based on equivalent album units.\nSince Luminate began electronically tracking music consumption in 1991, Swift is the first artist to have three different albums be Luminate\u2019s year-end No. 1. Adele is the only other act to have the year-end top album in three different years, but Adele did it with two albums: 21 (2011-12) and 25 (2015).\nPoets is the first album not by a solo male to be Luminate\u2019s year-end No. 1 since 2015, when Adele\u2019s 25 was tops.\nPoets earned 6.955 million equivalent album units in 2024 in the U.S., according to Luminate. That\u2019s the biggest yearly total for an album since 2015, when Adele\u2019s third album, 25, earned 8.008 million units. (Previous to Poets, the last album to clear 6 million units in a single year was 25.)\nHalf of Poets\u2019 2024 units was generated by traditional album sales (3.491 million of 6.955 million) \u2013 via purchases of physical (CD, cassette and vinyl) and digital download albums. Streaming equivalent album (SEA) units comprise 3.434 million and track equivalent album (TEA) units comprise 30,000. Poets was also the most-streamed album of 2024, by total on-demand official streams generated by its songs, with 4.490 billion streams.\nPoets was initially released on April 19 as a standard 16-song digital download album, as well as in an array of 17-song physical configurations. Two hours after the album dropped, Swift issued an expanded 31-song edition of the album, dubbed The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology, which added 15 additional songs. However, the Anthology edition was only available as a digital download and streaming set until Nov. 29, when its CD and vinyl editions became available for purchase exclusively through Target. The Target CD and vinyl additionally boast four bonus acoustic tracks (which were previously released in other alternate versions of the album). All told, more than 40 variants of Poets were released to U.S. customers in 2024, across CD, vinyl, cassette and digital download album versions.\nPoets yielded 10 top-10 charting songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, including the No. 1 \u201cFortnight,\u201d featuring Post Malone.\nRounding out Luminate\u2019s year-end top 10 albums are titles by Morgan Wallen, Sabrina Carpenter, SZA, Billie Eilish, Noah Kahan, Chappell Roan, Zach Bryan, and Future and Metro Boomin.\nTOP 10 ALBUMS OF 2024 IN U.S., BY TOTAL EQUIVALENT ALBUM UNITS\n1. Taylor Swift, The Tortured Poets Department (6.955 million)\n2. Morgan Wallen, One Thing at a Time (3.183 million)\n3. Sabrina Carpenter, Short n\u2019 Sweet (2.491 million)\n4.

Future & Metro Boomin, We Don\u2019t Trust You (1.606 million)\nSource: Luminate, for the tracking period Dec. 29, 2023, through Jan. 2, 2025. UGC streams are not included in this chart, but are included in Luminate\u2019s on-demand streaming charts (below).\nTOTAL U.S. AUDIO ALBUM CONSUMPTION INCREASES 5.6%: Audio equivalent album units increased by 5.6% in 2024, to 1.1 billion. For this figure, audio equivalent album units comprise traditional album sales (excluding independent retail sales*), track equivalent albums (TEA) and streaming equivalent albums (SEA, excluding video streams). Each unit equals one album sale, or 10 individual tracks sold from an album, or 3,750 ad-supported on-demand official audio streams generated by songs from an album, or 1,250 paid/subscription on-demand official audio streams generated by songs from an album.\n*Note: There was a change in methodology behind Luminate\u2019s independent retail store reporting beginning in January 2024, and, in turn, independent retail physical sales under the new methodology for 2024 are isolated and no trending analysis is provided versus 2023. So, any year-over-year album sales volume excludes independent retail physical sales, including the \u201ctotal U.S. audio album consumption\u201d figure above. Independent retail sales are included in all figures for individual album titles throughout this story.\nTAYLOR SWIFT\u2019S \u2018TORTURED POETS\u2019 IS 2024\u2019S TOP-SELLING ALBUM: Poets is also by far the top-selling album of 2024, with 3.491 million copies sold across all configurations (physical and digital purchases combined: CD, vinyl LP, cassette, digital download album). That makes it the highest-selling album of any calendar year in the U.S. since 2015, when Adele\u2019s 25 sold 7.441 million copies. See the top 10-selling albums, below.\nPoets\u2019 sales were so big that it outsold the year\u2019s Nos. 2-8 top sellers combined.\nTOP 10-SELLING ALBUMS OF 2024 IN U.S. (PHYSICAL & DIGITAL SALES COMBINED)\n1. Taylor Swift, The Tortured Poets Department (3.491 million)\n2. Billie Eilish, Hit Me Hard and Soft (570,000)\n3. Travis Scott, Days Before Rodeo (493,000)\n4.

Beyonc\u00e9, Cowboy Carter (329,000)\nSource: Luminate, for the tracking period Dec. 29, 2023, through Jan. 2, 2025.\nAn album by Swift has been the year\u2019s top-seller in seven of the last 11 years: Poets in 2024, 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version) in 2023, Midnights in 2022, Folklore in 2020, Lover in 2019, Reputation in 2017 and 1989 in 2014. She also had the year\u2019s top seller in 2009 with Fearless. Swift is the only act to have the top-selling album of the year at least eight times since Luminate began tracking sales in 1991.\nPoets was also the year\u2019s top-selling album on CD (1.512 million), vinyl (1.489 million), digital download (465,000) and cassette (24,000).\nAs mentioned earlier in this story, Poets was available across more than 40 different variants in the U.S. in 2024 \u2013 helping its sales figures. In total, there have been 15 CD editions, seven vinyl variants, four cassettes, and 19 digital download versions. Most versions contain at least one bonus track (ranging from bonus studio songs to acoustic or live renditions of songs from the album).\nTaylor Swift sold the most albums of any act in 2024 in the U.S., as her collected catalog of albums sold 6.003 million copies (across all configurations, physical and digital combined). The second-biggest act, by album sales in 2024, was Stray Kids, with 1.009 million sold. Swift and Stray Kids were also the Nos. 1 and 2-selling acts, by album sales, in 2023.\nPHYSICAL & DIGITAL ALBUM SALES DECLINE: Luminate reports that physical album sales \u2013 excluding independent retail store sales \u2013 declined 1% in 2024 to 55.6 million. (Indie store sales are excluded from this year-over-year album sales volume comparisons due to a methodology change, as noted earlier in this story, behind Luminate\u2019s independent retail store reporting in 2024 versus 2023.) Digital album sales fell 9.5% in 2024 to 16.8 million.\nVINYL ALBUM SALES INCREASE 4.3%: Luminate\u2019s year-end report reveals that U.S. vinyl album sales increased 4.3% in 2024 as compared to 2023, when excluding independent retail store sales (due to the methodology change noted above in this story). In 2023, industry-wide, vinyl sales increased for an 18th consecutive year.\nTOP 10-SELLING VINYL ALBUMS OF 2024 IN U.S.\n1. Taylor Swift, The Tortured Poets Department (1.489 million)\n2.

Olivia Rodrigo, Guts (175,000)\nSource: Luminate, for the tracking period Dec. 29, 2023, through Jan. 2, 2025.\nThe Tortured Poets Department was the top-selling vinyl LP of 2024, with 1.489 million sold \u2013 more than four times the number of copies that the second-biggest vinyl set of the year, Billie Eilish\u2019s Hit Me Hard and Soft, sold: 340,000. Poets is only the second album to sell a million copies on vinyl in a calendar year since Luminate started tracking sales in 1991.
