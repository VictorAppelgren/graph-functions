  "title": "Identifying The Right \u2018Why\u2019 For AI",
  "description": "Those who define their \"why\" with precision unlock efficiency and go on to create transformative, durable value.",
  "content": "Agur J\u00f5gi, CTO of Pipedrive and expert in scaling technology and organizations. Experienced as an innovator, founder and C-level manager.\n\nHere\u2019s the spoiler up front: Your AI strategy is only as strong as your \"why.\"\n\nAI is no longer a technical novelty; it\u2019s an explicit executive mandate from many business leaders that has resulted in recent notable headlines. Particularly in the SaaS sector, where differentiation is hard-won and retention is king, leaders are heavily investing in AI to reshape their products, platforms and internal corporate operations. It has the hallmarks of a hype bubble\u2014though that\u2019s not saying that AI benefits are all hot air. Far from it.\n\nThe core question should be \"Why are you deploying AI in the first place?\" Does the reason make strategic sense? It\u2019s easy to be seduced by the excitement of emerging capabilities\u2014never mind the sense of urgency as peers and seemingly everyone else are making their big bets. While early industry missteps might be a result of overenthusiastic decision making, those that don\u2019t wise up and set a clear vision and roadmap risk spiraling, wasting time, money and goodwill.\n\nIf enterprises are to secure real value from their AI investments, then all steps need to be taken with careful intention and an eye on possible second-order effects and perceptions. Companies rushing to deploy without clarity can risk misalignment, wasted investment and erosion of customer (and employee) trust. Those who define their \"why\" with precision unlock efficiency and go on to create transformative, durable value.\n\nThe technology industry has no shortage of new AI-powered features. Some have raised immediate questions, like AI assistants in social media sharing chats to the social feed. Some show immediate and quantifiable value, like automatically suggesting follow-up actions after a recorded meeting. There\u2019s a tension in the rush to show value, with some features being more ornamental than essential. The line between innovation and intrusion can be thin without clear intentionality and an articulated strategy.\n\nThat \"ornamentality,\" when AI is used reactively and bolted onto software products in response to perceived market pressure or investor expectations, can quickly result in increased user friction, features that sound intelligent but feel irrelevant and operational drag from maintaining underused systems.\n\nTech leaders must resist a knee-jerk impulse. Every AI investment should begin not with what\u2019s possible, but with what\u2019s strategic.\n\nThe Strategic \u2018Why\u2019\u2014Anchoring AI In Value Drivers\n\nIn SaaS, AI has the potential to impact three core value drivers. These are customer retention, operational scalability and product stickiness. Ask yourself: Where do customers most struggle in their journey? What decisions are made repeatedly that could be improved or automated? How can AI extend the value of the core product without diluting its usability?\n\nHere are some examples of high-leverage \"whys\":\n\u2022 Customer success: AI-powered onboarding guidance tailored to industry use case, maturity or other important parameters.\n\u2022 Support operations: Predictive classification and resolution of support tickets, reducing average time to resolution.\n\u2022 Product usage: Intelligent surfacing of features based on behavior, improving feature adoption and upsell.\n\nThese aren\u2019t ornamental features\u2014they are force multipliers. But only if the problem and opportunity are well understood and then carefully applied.\n\nWhile the field hasn\u2019t been active for long, those looking for AI missteps can spy some patterns:\n\u2022 Automating before understanding: Replacing workflows without modeling the nuance behind them.\n\u2022 Forgetting fallback paths: Relying on AI systems without any human override points leads to avoidable failure points.\n\nTech companies, particularly SaaS companies, operate in dynamic, high-stakes environments. Trust, clarity and control aren\u2019t just nice-to-haves; they are product requirements. Any AI deployment that weakens those will backfire and damage the brand offering.\n\nGetting It Right\n\nTreat AI as a portfolio investment. Not all initiatives carry the same risk or ROI. Leaders must balance issues such as efficiency bets (like internal automations offering a clear cost saving), product bets (features that deepen user engagement or enable premium pricing) and exploration bets (new paradigms and genuine whitespace innovation). Each should have a business case, success metrics and review cadence.\n\nValidate these bets with real (not vanity) metrics, like pre-agreed user and market signals. Pilot projects internally or with friendly early adopters. Gather usage data, not just sentiment. Aim to learn fast, iterate decisively and avoid scaling mistakes and distractions.\n\nThink and act cross-functionally. AI strategy must involve product, engineering, design, legal and data science, all from day one. Establish shared principles around bias mitigation, data governance and explainability. Yes, it\u2019s more work, but AI features can become white elephants, red herrings and black marks. Use diverse brainpower to solve for problems no one person or team can see alone.\n\nPut your own lifejacket on first. Internal use cases are golden paths to learning as well as making immediate bottom-line gains.\n\nFor example, documentation summarization for onboarding new engineers, sales enablement tools that auto-tailor pitches based on CRM signals or auto-tagging of product feedback to inform roadmap prioritization. Internal wins are easier to implement; they build organizational muscle and intelligence. That all supports a stronger external launch.\n\nTech companies sit at an intersection of massive data flows, evolving customer expectations and fierce competition. AI offers unprecedented tools, but without that strategic \"why,\" those tools risk becoming distractions.\n\nThe leaders who define their AI strategy around real user pain, product leverage and organizational readiness will be the ones who win. Not just by shipping AI features, but by building smarter, more adaptive companies. Every big technological shift has been successful in its implementation only with the right practices and culture as well. When starting with strategy, it\u2019s so much easier to ensure every piece of the puzzle falls into place.\n\nis an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.",

  "argos_summary": "Agur J\u00f5gi, CTO of Pipedrive, emphasizes the importance of having a clear strategic 'why' when deploying AI in organizations, particularly in the SaaS sector. As AI becomes a critical focus for business leaders, companies must avoid rushing into AI investments without understanding their purpose, as this can lead to wasted resources and diminished trust. Successful AI implementation should enhance customer retention, operational scalability, and product stickiness, while also requiring cross-functional collaboration and careful consideration of user needs.",
