      "feedback": "Your draft already captures the key catalysts, but it needs tightening to meet the strict format and depth requirements. 1) **Movers & Scenarios**: keep exactly four lines, each with the exact six fields (Up/Down, Time window, Driver/Mechanism, What to watch, Probability %).  Remove any extra commas or parenthetical notes that break the “What to watch” field; list only the primary signal(s).  2) **Probabilities**: base them on the weight of evidence in the source material.  For the 1–2‑week Up, 70 % is justified by the strong dovish speech (OGK8WLL69) and Switch 2 sales >2 M units (K2JWRPXRV).  For the 3–4‑week Up, 60 % is reasonable given the crypto inflows (OGK8WLL69) and soy export tightness (J54PXL0NV).  For the Down scenarios, reduce the 40 % to 35 % and the 30 % to 25 % to reflect the lower likelihood of a tariff spike (218AGGUXB) and an AI slowdown (1GVYF2V8O).  3) **Trade/Outlook Plan**: keep a single line, but replace “Current level” with a concrete price if available; otherwise note “at market close”.  Ensure the entry, stop, target, R/R, invalidation, trigger, probability, and confidence are all present and separated by vertical bars.  4) **Remove all post‑plan commentary**: the paragraph after the trade line is filler and violates the “no trailing citation lists” rule.  5) **Citations**: keep only the IDs that support specific facts or numbers; do not cite for generic statements.  6) **First‑principles clarity**: in the brief “What to watch” field, explicitly link the Fed cut to real‑rate compression, dollar weakness, and equity valuation lift; link crypto inflows to tech‑stock risk‑on; link Switch sales to gaming‑hardware ETF upside.  7) **Consistency**: ensure the same driver appears in both the scenario line and the trade trigger (e.g., Fed minutes no cut is the invalidation trigger, Switch sales >2 M units is the entry trigger).  Apply these edits and the output will meet the world‑class, actionable standard.",
