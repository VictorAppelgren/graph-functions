  "description": "Alan Dershowitz returns to a pierogi food stand demanding service in an odd dispute with its owners.",
  "content": "Notorious defense attorney Alan Dershowitz was jeered and escorted from a farmer\u2019s market stand on Martha\u2019s Vineyard after he insisted on returning to a vendor that had previously refused to serve him.\n\nThe retired Harvard Law professor, who famously represented both Jeffrey Epstein and President Donald Trump, had tried to buy food from the Good Pierogi stand last week but was turned away.\n\nHundreds of people came out Wednesday to support Good Pierogi, the Vineyard Gazette said in an Instagram post. Photos shared on social media showed a long line had already gathered by 9:03 a.m.\n\nAfter posting a video accusing Good Pierogi of discriminating against him \u201cbecause I defended Donald Trump and because I was a Zionist,\u201d and threatening to sue the West Tisbury Farmers Market, Dershowitz returned to confront stand owners Krem Miskevich and Lily Rose, and demand service.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here in an effort to try to restore community and to ask you to sell me pierogi in the interest of keeping the island together, so we don\u2019t have to have two pierogi stands: one for anti-Zionists and one for people who will sell to anybody,\u201d Dershowitz told the vendor, as seen in video from The Martha\u2019s Vineyard Times.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019d ask you to please just sell me any one of your products to show that you\u2019re prepared to sell to anybody and not allow your anti-Zionism to decide which people you\u2019ll sell to,\u201d Dershowitz continued, and tried to give the owner a signed copy of his book.\n\nMiskevich replied, \u201cI am very surprised that you\u2019re here because of the things that you\u2019ve been saying about us and the business online. I really do not appreciate what you\u2019ve been sharing in the last week.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it true? You have proof that I am an antisemite?\u201d replied Miskevich, who is Jewish and has relatives who live in Israel.\n\nMiskevich has previously described why he refused Dershowitz\u2019s business, \u201cWhat was in the forefront of my mind was the fact that this was a high-profile attorney who represented several sexual predators and abusers including Jeffrey Epstein.\u201d\n\nWhen Dershowitz returned on Wednesday, a woman working at the stall said her name was Talia and told him she was Jewish. As Talia shared her views about her faith, a group of onlookers clapped and cheered, prompting Dershowitz to accuse the crowd of \u201csupporting this bigotry.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call us bigots,\u201d an onlooker replied angrily. \u201cMy grandparents died in the Holocaust! Don\u2019t you call me an antisemite.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease do not bully us,\u201d Miskevich added. \u201cPlease do not call us bigots.\u201d\n\n\u201cBullying you? You\u2019re the one who won\u2019t sell me my pierogi!\u201d Dershowitz complained.\n\nAfter Dershowitz continued to insist that the vendor read his book and learn the \u201ctruth,\u201d the group of onlookers began chanting, \u201cTime to go. Time to go.\u201d\n\nDershowitz was then escorted away by the farmer\u2019s market manager, Ethan Buchanan-Valenti, as onlookers cheered. Someone offered Good Pierogi a tip, and the group clapped.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to both Dershowitz and Good Pierogi for comment.\n\nAfter Dershowitz failed to convince Good Pierogi to serve him, he told the seller that it was illegal to deny people service based on race, religion, and sexuality; accused the vendor of McCarthyism; and began warning other customers not to patronize the \u201cbigoted\u201d stand.",

      "text": "Lawyer Alan Dershowitz thinks the jailers where Jeffrey Epstein was being housed while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges played a role in the disgraced financier\u2019s death.\nThe notorious defense lawyer said in an interview with Real America\u2019s Voice that he did not think Epstein was murdered\u2014as many of President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters have claimed\u2014but suggested the death was indeed suspicious.\n\u201cHe was in jail awaiting trial when he, I think, killed himself with the help of jailers,\u201d Dershowitz told Real America\u2019s Voice host Eric Bolling last week. \u201cI don\u2019t think he could have done it by himself.\u201d\nFor weeks, the president has faced anger from his MAGA base over his administration\u2019s failure to produce new information in the case.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s probe ended up repeating the previous official position that Epstein died by suicide, and there was no client list.\nDershowitz\u2014whose big-name clients have included O.J. Simpson, Mike Tyson, and Trump himself during his first impeachment trial\u2014helped Epstein secure a sweetheart plea deal during a Florida state prosecution in 2008.\nUnder the terms of the deal, Epstein avoided federal charges and served just 13 months in a county jail and was allowed to leave during the day to work. Trump tapped the prosecutor who struck the deal, Alex Acosta, to serve as labor secretary during his first term.\nHe resigned after Epstein was arrested in July 2019 on federal sex trafficking charges in New York. That same month, Dershowitz told NPR that he no longer had a relationship with Epstein.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen him in years and I haven\u2019t spoken to him in months,\u201d he said. \u201cOccasionally, his lawyers\u2014his current lawyers\u2014will call to ask me questions about the plea deal. But I have no current legal relationship with him or personal relationship.\u201d\nEpstein was found hanging in his cell on August 10, 2019, at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City.\nOfficials said he was on suicide watch at the time, but the guards who were supposed to be checking on him didn\u2019t make their rounds. His roommate had been transferred out of his cell\u2014which was a breach of prison protocol\u2014and the FBI found that the surveillance cameras directly outside his cell had malfunctioned the night he died.\nAll of that has fed conspiracy theories that one of Epstein\u2019s powerful clients arranged to have him killed in his cell.\nDershowitz wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed last week that he believed the anomalies were evidence that jail personnel had \u201clikely\u201d assisted Epstein\u2019s suicide.\nHis editorial also tried to distance Trump from Epstein, despite the two being close friends for 15 years."

      "text": "Hell hath no fury like a Jeffrey Epstein-defending pierogi lover scorned.\nNotorious defense attorney Alan Dershowitz announced that he\u2019s suing a farmer\u2019s market on Martha\u2019s Vineyard after the market\u2019s resident pierogi stand refused to serve him.\nDuring the latest episode of his podcast The Dershow, Dershowitz recalled how he was especially excited to go to the West Tisbury\u2019s Farmer\u2019s Market on Wednesday because he had received insider intel that the first corn crop of the summer had arrived early this year.\nAfter buying a dozen ears of corn and placing an order from his usual juice guy for a fresh-squeezed orange juice with a splash of lemon justice, the retired Harvard law professor stopped by the pierogi stand and asked if he could have six of the potato dumplings.\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied the vendor.\n\u201cOh, you\u2019ve run out of pierogi? Too bad,\u201d Dershowitz said he replied.\n\u201cNo, we have plenty of pierogi,\u201d the person behind the counter replied, according to the lawyer. \u201cI just won\u2019t sell them to you.\u201d\nAt that point, Dershowitz\u2014who represented President Donald Trump during his impeachment trial and helped Epstein secure a sweetheart plea deal for solicitation of underage prostitution in 2008\u2014demanded an explanation.\n\u201cI won\u2019t sell them to you because I don\u2019t approve of your politics,\u201d the seller replied, according to Dershowitz. \u201cI don\u2019t approve of who you\u2019ve represented. I don\u2019t approve of who you support.\u201d\nWhen Dershowitz\u2014whose other celebrity clients have included Mike Tyson, O.J. Simpson, Harvey Weinstein, and Patty Hearst\u2014asked for details, the vendor refused to elaborate.\n\u201cThe clear implication was that he opposed me because I defended Donald Trump and because I was a Zionist,\u201d Dershowitz said.\nThe week before, he had gone to the farmer\u2019s market wearing a T-shirt that said, \u201cProud American Zionist,\u201d and he noticed the pierogi vendor looking at the shirt \u201cstrangely\u201d even though they didn\u2019t talk, Dershowitz noted.\nBy his own admission, after being refused service, Dershowitz told the seller that it was illegal to deny people service on the basis of race, religion, and sexuality; accused the vendor of McCarthyism; and began warning other customers not to patronize the \u201cbigoted\u201d stand.\nTwo police officers then approached Dershowitz and said the vendor had a right to deny him service, and threatened to arrest him for trespassing if he continued interfering with the business.\nChris Hulbert, 59, filmed part of the police encounter. After the stand\u2019s owner walked away, Dershowitz began bothering some women who worked there, demanding to know why he wasn\u2019t being served and accusing them of being antisemitic, Hulbert told the Daily Beast.\nThe women were doing everything they could do ignore Dershowitz, who kept filming them while insisting they were discriminating against him based on politics. So Hulbert\u2014who at first didn\u2019t realize who Dershowitz was\u2014engaged him.\n\u201cI was like, \u2018What political views could possible get you banned from pierogis?\u2019\u201d Hulbert said. \u201cI asked if he\u2019s a Trumper, and he says, \u2018No, I\u2019m the opposite! But I represented Epstein and Trump at one point.\u2019\u201d\nHulbert then figured it out and asked Dershowitz if his name was \u201cAlan.\u201d When Dershowitz said it was, Hulbert replied, \u201cWell you should know I was vice president of Take Back New York for seven years. We lobbied for Meghan\u2019s Law and also created the first predator database.\u201d\nDershowitz then said, \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d and left, but returned after Hulbert walked away, he said. At that point, the police arrived and Hulbert gave the police a witness statement. The officer said they had received three complaints from vendors about Dershowitz.\nThe pierogi vendor, good_pierogi, thanked Hulbert on social media and offered him free pierogis for his efforts.\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to good_pierogi and Dershowitz for comment.\nOn his show, Dershowitz said he was suing the farmer\u2019s market to try to force it to change its policy to only allow vendors that will \u201csell to everybody.\u201d\nHe also rehashed his old gripes about being treated as a pariah on liberal Martha\u2019s Vineyard ever since he defended Trump, saying he had been \u201cbanned\u201d from the island\u2019s book fair, library, and reform synagogue, and was no longer invited to social functions.\nCalling Martha\u2019s Vineyard one of the most \u201cintolerant\u201d places he\u2019s ever been, he admitted that 90 percent of the town of Chilmark, where he has a vacation home, probably agreed with the pierogi maker.\n\u201cIt\u2019s worse than McCarthyism of the 1950s, because McCarthyism of the 1950s went after the people themselves\u2014the communists, the lawyers who represented the communists,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Chilmark, they go after my wife, they go after my children, they go after my grandchildren, and they take it out on everybody.\u201d"

      "text": "Alan Dershowitz wants everyone to know he\u2019s been \u201cblackballed\u201d on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. And the emeritus Harvard law professor apparently will not stop talking about it until all of America has heard his sob story.\nThe longtime attorney and Jeffrey Epstein pal has spent the past few years grumbling about the treatment he\u2019s endured during his regular stays in the exclusive playground of the ultra-wealthy. It started with a 2018 column for The Hill, when he whined at length about the \u201cshunning\u201d he\u2019d received in the Vineyard for defending then-President Donald Trump\u2014painting himself as a true champion of civil liberties.\n\u201cBut one good thing is that being shunned by some \u2018old friends\u2019 on Martha\u2019s Vineyard has taught me who my real friends are and who my fairweather friends were,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFrom a personal point of view, I could not care less about being shunned by people whose views regarding dialogue I do not respect.\u201d\nDespite widespread mockery for that column, Dersh has continued to portray himself as a victim of \u201ccancel culture\u201d at the hands his elite neighbors. In fact, he\u2019s made his supposed \u201ccancellation\u201d the primary theme of his latest book, titled, The Price of Principle: Why Integrity Is Worth the Consequences.\nAs such, Dershowitz has recently taken to social media and regularly appeared on pro-Trump cable channel Newsmax to repeatedly rehash his Vineyard traumas. He also shared an email from someone who claimed they were beaten up on the beach merely for reading a Dershowitz book.\nDuring one Newsmax appearance this past weekend, Dersh insisted that aside from his tragic \u201ccancellation\u201d on the island, several unnamed residents have lamented to him that they can no longer see him doing public speaking events in the Vineyard.\n\u201cThe library won't allow me to speak on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, the Community Center, the major synagogue, all of them have cancelled me because I had the chutzpah to defend the Constitution on behalf of a president of the United States that they all voted against,\u201d he groused. \u201cPeople refuse to attend events if they know I\u2019m gonna be there and that\u2019s why several friends of mine have who have invited me for years to events in their home or concerts that they\u2019ve sponsored have apologetically said: \u2018We\u2019re sorry we can\u2019t invite you because if you come everybody will leave.\u2019\u201d\nThat segment, and the resulting ridicule, brought Dershowitz to the attention of New Yorker staff writer Isaac Chotiner. And even though Chotiner has the well-earned reputation of systematically dismantling his interview subjects with dry humor, razor-sharp quips, and biting questions, Dersh somehow agreed to chat with him. The conversation went just as one would expect.\nAnd, of course, Dershowitz couldn\u2019t stop talking about the Vineyard.\nAt one point, the famed attorney declared he was the \u201cmost popular speaker\u201d in something called \u201cthe Chilmark Library series,\u201d only for Chotiner to deadpan: \u201cI can imagine.\u201d Dershowitz then went on to claim the library first gave him the excuse that his \u201ccrowds were too big\u201d as the reason they hadn\u2019t recently booked him, adding that he asked them to limit the crowds.\n\u201cCan you imagine if Ed Sullivan had done that with the Beatles? It\u2019s a ridiculous excuse,\u201d Chotiner deadpanned.\nElsewhere, Dershowitz claimed he\u2019s been \u201cbesieged with phone calls\u201d from people complaining they\u2019ve been denied the chance to see his speeches. (Of course, the local library director told Chotiner that \u201cnot one single person has contacted me to complain that they haven\u2019t had a chance to hear Alan speak.\u201d)\nYet, while all he\u2019s done is air grievances about his lack of speaking invitations, Dersh has repeatedly insisted this isn\u2019t actually about his \u201ccancellation\u201d\u2014it\u2019s about that silent majority of Dershowitz fans.\n\u201cI want to make it clear it\u2019s not about me. I have a thick skin. It\u2019s about the other people in Chilmark who want to hear my views, people who come here because they love the culture and they love going to the book fair,\u201d he said. \u201cThey love going to the library events, to the community center. Now they can\u2019t hear me at any of those places and see me.\u201d\nStill, even after getting the Chotiner treatment, Dersh has pressed on, more determined than ever to tell the world about the horrors of not getting booked for a library speech in the Vineyard.\nAppearing on newly minted Newsmax host Greta Van Susteren\u2019s show on Monday evening, the famed lawyer pivoted from talking about the Jan. 6 House committee hearings to the price he\u2019s paid for his brave truth-telling.\n\u201cI have been punished severely. I can\u2019t speak at the library at Martha's Vineyard,\u201d he cried as Van Susteren appeared to stifle a yawn. \u201cI have been silenced.\u201d\nThe following afternoon, Newsmax gave him far more time to complain about his trials and tribulations.\nWhile analyzing former Trump strategist Steve Bannon\u2019s contempt case, the attorney connected his own experiences on the island to Bannon\u2019s trial.\n\u201cThat said, it\u2019s an anti-Trump jurisdiction and the vast majority of people who live in the District of Columbia hate Trump,\u201d Dershowitz declared. \u201cLook, I know! I go through that. I live on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. I couldn\u2019t get a fair trial at Martha's Vineyard. I can\u2019t even speak in the library at Martha\u2019s Vineyard because I defended Trump. So don\u2019t expect in the District of Columbia to get a fair jury trial.\u201d\nMoving on to his book, he fumed about being \u201cblackballed\u201d from the island\u2019s Jewish cultural center and book fair. However, he once again insisted, he \u201chas a thick skin\u201d and the real \u201cvictims are the citizens of Martha\u2019s Vineyard\u201d who\u2019ve been denied the opportunity to see him.\n\u201cThey are being deprived of their First Amendment rights,\u201d Dershowitz exclaimed.\nHis Tuesday afternoon grievance session eventually ended the same way as his Chotiner interview\u2014with him recalling his public spat with Larry David while saying he can no longer stomach watching Curb Your Enthusiasm.\n\u201cAnd Larry David refuses to talk to me\u2014he says I\u2019m disgusting,\u201d he stated. \u201cYou know, it turns out the Larry David you see on Curb Your Enthusiasm\u2014that\u2019s not an act! That curmudgeon is the real Larry David!\u201d\nDershowitz dramatically added: \u201cAnd I find it hard to watch Curb Your Enthusiasm because I\u2019m seeing this character almost have a stroke\u2014he was screaming at me, yelling at me. Wouldn\u2019t let me have lunch! I mean, it\u2019s much like the Kavanaugh experience, except so far nobody has tried to assassinate me. But don\u2019t put any ideas in anybody's head!\u201d"
