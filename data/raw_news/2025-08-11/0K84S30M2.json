  "content": "Parking schemes to be reviewed due to concerns\n\nOn-street residents permits could be introduced in another part of Gloucester after concerns were raised about parking congestion. Gloucestershire County Council's highways team is looking at options to make parking better for residents and businesses in Elmbridge, the Local Democracy Reporting Service reports. It is also reviewing existing off-street parking schemes in Kingsholm and Wootton, which were introduced in 2023. \"It's crucial that we hear about your daily experiences so that the council can find ways to enhance parking for everyone in the area,\" said councillor Jeremy Hilton.\n\nThe council said the review will look for any areas that need to change in order to improve the parking scheme for residents and businesses.\n\nCouncillor Jeremy Hilton said he has been working with the parking team to review restrictions in Kingsholm. \"We have made significant progress in reducing parking congestion in Kingsholm, but there is always room for improvement.\" He has said there are several hotspots in Elmbridge where on-street parking congestion is causing problems for residents. \"I have persuaded the parking team to review these issues, and I strongly encourage residents to write in.\" He said funding had already been secured to cover any necessary new traffic regulation orders. \"I am pleased to support this review, which will lay the groundwork for improving parking for everyone in the community,\" he added.",

But outside of my house, where I should be parking, I do find it hard,\" she said.\n\"We pay tax so we should have a permit.\n\"Other people should be paying to park around here,\" she added.\nGloucestershire County Council parking manager Alexis Newport said: \"This consultation is open to the public. We have no preconceived ideas.\"\nThe consultation runs until 19 August.\nFollow BBC West on Facebook, external, Twitter, external and Instagram, external.

      "text": "The journalists are funded by the BBC as part of its latest Charter commitment, but are employed by regional news organisations.\nA total of 165 reporters are allocated to news organisations in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\nThese organisations range from television and radio stations to online media companies and established regional newspaper groups.\nLocal Democracy Reporters cover top-tier local authorities, second-tier local authorities and other public service organisations.\nPrinciples of operation: Questions and answers\nStories written by the democracy reporters are shared with more than 1,100 media titles and outlets that have signed up to be part of the Local News Partnerships scheme.\nTo be awarded the democracy reporter contracts, the successful news organisations had to pass stringent criteria which included financial standing and a strong track record of relevant journalism in the area they were applying to cover.\nThe award decisions were made by senior editorial BBC figures.\nThe full list of organisations that were awarded contracts can be viewed here.\nLocal Democracy Reporter content can be downloaded via an online portal, accessed via a log-in code supplied to all qualifying news organisations.\nThe Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) is a public service news agency: funded by the BBC, provided by the local news sector, and used by qualifying partners. It\u2019s like a franchise: different companies with different approaches, but using common editorial standards and all publishing into the same system.\n- The core purpose of the LDRS is to provide impartial coverage of the regular business and workings of local authorities in the UK, and other relevant democratic institutions such as mayoralties, combined authority areas, P&CCs, quangos, etc.\n- The Local Democracy Reporters' (LDRs) brief is to report on the decision-making process: what decisions are made in the public's name and how they are arrived at, what evidence is presented to the council, etc.\n- The expectation is that LDRs shall endeavour to attend all meetings in person.\n- In two-tier council areas the LDRs should cover district council affairs sufficiently to ensure that significant decisions (eg planning) are reported.\n- LDRs may provide other stories which are focused on local democracy and which are in the public interest so long as that does not detract from the core purpose of the service.\n- All their work must be available to all qualifying partners.\n- National politics is out of scope, but election campaigns and constituency work of MPs, AMs, MSPs and MLAs that specifically relates to relevant local audiences may be covered so long as it does not detract from the core purpose of the LDRS.\nLDRs report to the contract holder, not to the BBC or any other partner.\nWith the guidance and support of the contract holder, LDRs work to the brief covering the stories of greatest public interest and they should not undertake commissions for any partner.\nDirect questions and clarifications relating to content are acceptable, but any suggestions or comments relating to the service should go through a LDR's manager.\nThe only difference between the BBC and others is that it has a right to request interviews or 2-ways for BBC Local Radio. Depending on workload and commitments it is up to each LDR to decide whether or not to agree.\nNo. While meeting the highest standards of accuracy and impartiality, written content may conform to an employer's normal style. BBC training will help create a common standard for media content production.\n- All content must be created for all qualifying partners.\n- Content should be published as soon as possible after a meeting or event.\n- All content must be published using the LDRS Authoring Tool so all partners see it simultaneously.\n- All content must be titled COUNCIL NAME: Story Name.\n- It must be tagged with at least one top-tier local authority, but can have as many tags as are relevant.\n- Images and media must have a descriptive label.\n- Images and media must be rights-free (LDRs should not use their employer\u2019s picture library, or images supplied by agencies or freelance contributors).\n- LDRs should, where possible, assign a \"Feature Image\" to a story.\n- LDRs must provide an Advisory note in the publishing system before the end of every week indicating their diary for the next seven days (or longer).\n- LDRs should source their content. An explanatory Note to Editors at the end of a story regarding the source will reduce queries from partners, especially around whether qualified privilege applies to all or part of a story.\n- LDRs should not file a story based on a press release already in the public domain unless it has been significantly developed with new quotes or information.\n- Embargoed content must explain why publication should be delayed.\n- Posts should be via LDRs' personal accounts rather than contractors' branded accounts.\n- LDRs are encouraged to post an Advisory in the LDRS Authoring Tool to let partners know if they intend live-Tweeting from a meeting, for example.\n- Tagging #LDReporter will help the partnership collate relevant tweets.\n- LDRs should be credited as \"First Name, Last Name, Local Democracy Reporter\".\n- By-lines or references within copy are acceptable.\n- Broadcasters should acknowledge LDRs when they appear on air or when the format allows.\n- Shared credit with other reporters is acceptable if LDRs' content is copied, edited or incorporated into new pieces of work.\n- The LDRS logo can also be used in print, online or on TV, but is not compulsory.\n- LDRs should refer to themselves as \"Local Democracy Reporters\", not \"BBC Local Democracy Reporters\" in all forms of communication, including social media profiles.\n- Corrections and clarifications relating to previously published stories must be clearly highlighted and issued immediately.\n- The headline style should be as follows: 'COUNCIL NAME: Story Name - CORRECTION'.\n- The first paragraph of the body copy should be as follows: 'CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that\u2026'."
