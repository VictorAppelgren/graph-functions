  "description": "Monday's tariff pause just in time for the iPhone 17 launch means Apple's import tariffs from China will only be ten times more than they were in March, instead of 50 times.",
  "content": "Apple will continue to pay extreme tariffs in China\n\nMonday's tariff pause just in time for the iPhone 17 launch means Apple's import tariffs from China will only be ten times more than they were in March, instead of 50 times.\n\nApple shared that if nothing changed as of July 31, it would incur another $1.1 billion in tariff costs for fiscal Q4. It seems that Apple has dodged a bullet as President Trump revealed he will delay increasing tariffs on China, yet again.\n\nThe pause was revealed just hours before the previous 90-day pause was set to end. According to CNBC, President Trump signed an executive order that pushes the deadline back another 90 days to mid-November.\n\nThe ongoing tariff war has created confusion and uncertainty for United States companies. Each escalation drives up costs, then usually within days, a sudden de-escalation and delay in enforcement causes a ripple effect.\n\nBusinesses are struggling to figure out how to navigate tariffs. And the many, constantly shifting goals of the tariffs just cause more confusion.\n\nCompanies like Apple cannot bring full production of its products back to the United States on any reasonable timescale, not even final assembly. So, Apple rearranged its supply chain so that a majority of iPhones shipped to the United States came from India.\n\nEven with that shift, which has helped Apple reduce the overall damage caused by the tariffs, Apple still took an $800 million hit in fiscal Q3. Apple CEO Tim Cook says Apple expects to take a $1.1 billion hit in fiscal Q4 if policy didn't change.\n\n\"Keep in mind that the vast majority of our products are covered under the Section 232 investigation,\" Cook said during the earnings call. \"Last quarter, the bulk of the tariffs that we paid were the [International Emergency Economic Powers Act] tariffs that hit early in the year related to China.\"\n\nThat Section 232 investigation Cook referenced is one brought on after Trump granted Apple exemptions from the Liberation Day tariffs announced on April 2. To ensure Trump didn't appear to be waffling on his policy, he announced that Apple's exemptions were actually a result of a semiconductor investigation, which was officially announced later.\n\nEven with those exemptions and a shift to India, Apple isn't immune from the tariffs. Apple seemingly narrowly avoided billions in tariff costs so far, but Trump's renewed attention on China could have had an even greater effect.\n\nPresident Trump did what was widely expected as he backed off more extreme tariffs that would raise their value to 50 times what Apple was paying before Trump took office. Now, they'll have to continue to contend with the 30% tariffs and pay 10 times more than what they paid pre-Trump.\n\nThat math is based on Apple having paid less than 3% to import from China in the days before the April tariff bonanza. More extreme tariffs will be explored yet again in November if trade negotiations continue to make zero headway.\n\nThat 30% value is what Apple based the $1.1 billion in costs for the fourth fiscal quarter on, that it announced during the July 31 earnings reveal. It is expected that Apple will pass these costs to the customer as it raises iPhone prices globally in the fall.\n\nIt's not clear what product mix will come from India, and what from China. In the iPhone 16 release season, the Pro models generally shipped direct to the consumer from China for early orders, and the non-Pro were imported from India.\n\nApple is facing at least 25% import tariffs from India, and that may escalate. After Trump's application of another 25% on top of the initial section 232 tariff application because of the purchase of Russian oil, India does not appear that interested in a deal.\n\nSources vary on if Apple has to pay a 50% import tariff from India, or a 25% one.",

      "text": "Apple's stock has regained some of its losses after the announcement of a 90-day pause on some new tariffs, while the tariff on imports from China to the U.S. has been jacked up to 125%.\nFollowing the introduction of a 104% tariff rate against China and further retaliation from China, Apple's stock was bracing for another day of turbulence on the market. However, after an announcement of a tariff pause, Apple's been given a bit of a reprieve.\nIn an announcement on Wednesday, President Donald Trump confirmed that he had authorized a 90-day pause on new tariffs against most countries the U.S. deals with. At the same time, there is also a lowering of the reciprocal tariff to 10% for the period.\nCNBC shares Trump's Truth Social post, explaining that more than 75 countries have attempted to negotiate with the U.S. over the tariffs. Trump also takes a moment to take a dig at China's reactionary tariff increases by saying the countries have not retaliated against the U.S.\nThe 90-day pause will give the Trump Administration time to negotiate with the responding countries, presumably to make deals with each one that still benefits the U.S. and Trump's aims.\nAt the same time, Trump cited a \"lack of respect\" from China, raising the tariff against imports from the country even further. Earlier in the day, the 104% tariff rate was implemented, but it's now moved to 125% with immediate effect.\nTrump adds that he hopes China will realise that \"ripping off the U.S.A\" and other countries is \"no longer sustainable or acceptable.\"\nIt is worth remembering that the tariffs were instigated by the Trump Administration first. China has responded to the tariffs by applying its own, but in each case, it has simply mirrored the size of increases performed by the United States.\nWhile China is singled out as being a country that retaliated, it is unclear why Trump hasn't mentioned the EU. Ahead of Trump's announcement, the European Union voted to approve the first set of retaliatory tariffs against the U.S.\nA boost for Apple\nThe reaction from the stock market was very positive, including a 7% jump on Nasdaq and a 2,000-point surge for the Dow.\nApple's stock, which has felt pressure over the last week, has also benefited. At the time of publication, the share price is up 11.28% in response.\nWhile the tariff against China is going up as retaliation for China increasing its own tariff on U.S. imports again, Apple stands to benefit from an easing of other tariffs.\nThe reduction of the reciprocal tariffs for other countries down to the 10% level reduces what Apple will have to pay for some of its product imports. After expanding its supply chain to be less China-centric, Apple can now take advantage of its production in India, Vietnam, and other countries to supply U.S. customers.\nWith the possibility of negotiations between Trump and countries looking to make a deal, there could be a glimmer of hope once the 90-day period is over. The other countries where Apple's supply chain is situated may probably come out of the pause with a better tariff than the ones announced about a week ago.\nStill, that 10% is in most cases about double the previous export rates."

      "text": "To somehow support claims that the tariff exemption is not an exemption at all, the White House has announced an investigation into the entire semiconductor market segment.\nOn April 2, 2025, Trump announced his \"Liberation Day\" slew of tariffs for which there would be no exemptions. On April 9, he granted Apple an exemption.\nBut following the worldwide recognition that this was an exemption, over the weekend of April 10 and 11, Trump proclaimed that it was nothing of the sort. He said \"there was no Tariff 'exception'... they are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket',\" as if it were all part of the plan.\nAt the same time, Trump did also promise to launch a national security trade investigation into the \"whole electronics supply chain.\" Now according to CNBC, the White House has announced exactly that.\nExcept it hasn't, not exactly. The announcement is in a document on the Federal Register that can be read, but officially will not be published until April 16. In it, the White House claims that:\nOn April 1, 2025, the Secretary of Commerce initiated an investigation under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act (19 U.S.C. 1862) to determine the effects on national security of imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products. This includes, among other things, semiconductor substrates and bare wafers, legacy chips, leading-edge chips, microelectronics, and SME components.\nIt's not clear why an investigation begun on April 1 would not be announced until April 15, and not officially enacted until April 16. Nor how it can have been started before the \"reciprocal\" tariffs were announced, but then itself be announced after the tariffs were reversed with the Apple exemption.\nNor is it clear why technology firms were hit with the \"reciprocal\" tariffs if it were already planned that they would come under the different \"bucket\" of semiconductor tariffs.\nNonetheless, the filing is very clear that the government is seeking submissions from interested parties. They must submit comments \"no later than [INSERT DATE 21 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER].\"\nThe investigation wants to determine the current and projected semiconductor demand in the US, plus to what degree local production can meet that. The filing then has some vaguely-worded clauses about \"the role of foreign fabrication... in meeting US demand,\" and the \"concentration of United States imports... and the associated risks.\"\nThere are many other issues listed in the filing, but they all come down to what the US needs and what the US can make itself.\nBut the key part is number 9 in a series of 14 points. It says the investigation concerns \"the impact of current trade and other policies on domestic semiconductor and SME production and capacity, and whether additional measures, including tariffs or quotas, are necessary to protect national security.\"\nIt's wrong to assume the outcome of any investigation, but in \"21 DAYS AFTER DATE OF PUBLICATION IN THE FEDERAL REGISTER,\" technology businesses can expect tariffs and perhaps quotas. That's not an educated guess: commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has already prejudged the investigation and said that semiconductor tariffs will be coming.\nMaybe it's necessary, maybe there are security risks. And so nothing deters foreign spies like making US businesses and consumers pay more for the privilege of being spied on.\nNote that Lutnick said the semiconductor tariffs would be \"coming in probably a month or two.\" Trump has now said they would come next week, according to BBC News.\nApril 1, April 16, next week, a month or two, no exemptions, Apple exemptions, again no exemptions, there is no plan to this. Which means despite the markets rising at the news of Apple exemptions, they are going to continue to be volatile for at least weeks longer.\nAnd, regardless, the 10% tariffs to somehow stop the fentanyl trade are still in place for these goods. This is still more than was being applied before the first shot was fired in the trade war almost two weeks ago."

      "text": "Apple's bill for Trump's tariffs in the third quarter was a little less than first expected, but Tim Cook has cautioned that it will be considerably more in the next quarter, totaling about $2 billion across just two quarters.\nBack in March 2025 and Apple's regular earnings report, CEO Tim Cook took the unusual step of looking ahead to the next quarter. It was because of the then impending impact of Trump's tariffs, and Cook said to expect that the cost to Apple would be $900 million.\nThat figure was less than expected and appeared to show that Apple had successfully reshaped its supply and delivery lines to mitigate against the worst of the tariffs. Now during its latest earnings call, Cook reported that the actual impact of tariffs was approximately $800 million.\nHe said that the majority of the tariffs Apple paid were in connection with Trump's ones against China, \"that hit early in the year.\" Cook stressed that the majority of iPhones sold in the US now come from India, while most Macs, iPadd, and Apple Watches are made in Vietnam.\nRerouting production and distribution obviously incurred costs. But moving it to countries with the lowest tariffs meant the total come in at $100 million less than expected. However, Cook said that the next quarter should be significantly higher.\nTariff costs will rise in the next quarter\n\"For the September quarter, assuming the current global tariff rates, policies, and applications do not change for the balance of the quarter and no new tariffs are added,\" he said, \"we estimate the impact to add about $1.1 billion to our costs.\"\nThere were many caveats to the prediction. Cook also stressed, though, that the \"estimate should not be used to make projections for future quarters, as there are many factors that could change, including tariff rates.\"\nThose potential changes include the continuing Trump negotiations with other countries. For instance, the most recent one that will see Apple paying eight times as much to import devices from India than it did before.\nApple is also awaiting the results of a US probe into semiconductor usage in the States. While that probe is claimed to be investigating whether there are any issues that warrant raising tariffs, the White House has pre-judged the result and confirmed that there will be a tariff.\nThe first fiscal quarter of 2026 is the 2025 holiday sales season \u2014 which is also Apple's biggest quarter of the year. No predictions have been made for that quarter."

      "text": "Donald Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" has become a potentially expensive event for Apple, as tariffs are applied against imports from every foreign country in the Apple supply chain.\nPresident Donald Trump said that tariffs would be a major part of his administration long before his reelection. On Wednesday, his campaign promise became a reality.\nAs part of what Trump refers to as \"Liberation Day,\" the U.S. is applying \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from around the world. The levies, which will come into force immediately and will impact practically all imported goods entering the United States.\nThe value of the tariff rate varies depending on the country, but for the majority, the rate was expected to be an average of 20%. Trump had previously promised to levy reciprocal tariffs against countries that applied their own tariffs on U.S. goods.\nThe reality, it seems, that tariffs will range from 10% to 49%. Trump says these numbers were derived by cutting the existing tariffs on the United States from those countries and applying them back at half.\nHowever, it seems these numbers were actually derived by taking the trade deficit of a specific country then dividing it by imports to arrive at a percentage Trump calls \"tariffs on America.\" He took this derived number and halved it to come up with the US \"reciprocal\" tariffs.\nThe large-scale application of tariffs is of historic proportions, all in a bid by Trump to allegedly protect and revive U.S. industry. Though Trump wanted the tariffs from the first day and has taken time to implement them, they're here and consumers and businesses have to deal with them.\nTrump's \"Make America Wealthy Again\" Rose Garden event will have a considerable financial impact on almost everyone in the United States.\nA probable consumer loss\nWhile the aim of the tariffs is to bring manufacturing back to the United States, the method of using tariffs is one that will have some short-term consequences.\nFor a start, the tariffs are fees typically paid by the companies importing goods. As with many other cost changes in business, this tends to be passed down to the consumer in the form of price rises.\nUltimately, tariffs hurt both consumers and businesses.\nThe intention of the tariffs is to make it too expensive for businesses to produce products abroad and then import them into the United States. Trump's answer to that is for businesses to produce more of its goods within the United States in the first place.\nHowever, that can only really work if all of the product's components are made within the United States. Imported components are also subject to tariffs, so even products made in the U.S. will still be affected if their parts are made elsewhere.\nA big Apple problem\nAs a major U.S. company with a sprawling supply chain, the tariffs immediately become a problem for Apple. The vast majority of its products are made overseas and then imported into the United States.\nIn the case of iPhones, it has facilities in China and India making the smartphones, which are then imported to the United States and sold to consumers. Every iPhone would therefore be afflicted by the tariffs, raising the cost to consumers.\nWhile Apple could potentially bring iPhone production to the United States, it's not something that is immediate or makes much financial sense at the moment. Establishing a new production line in the United States is a very costly procedure, and that's before you consider the sheer number of components made in different areas of the world.\nIt's still going to get its newest A-series and M-series chips from TSMC's Taiwan facility, because the U.S. counterparts aren't able to work to that level, and won't for years.\nLocal U.S. production would also mean much higher employment costs versus other economies, with U.S. employees expected to be paid a lot more than their Chinese counterparts.\nApple has spent some time shifting its production outside of China and into India, in part to mitigate global events such as tariffs, but that only goes partway to fixing the problem.\nThe effort also took years to develop, due to the sheer size of the project. It's not something Apple can immediately fix in the short to near term.\nBased on Apple's typical timescales for supply chain change, increased production in the United States could eventually happen. Though probably far beyond the end of the Trump Administration.\nCEO Tim Cook has previously managed to work with Trump to minimize the effects of tariffs against Apple in the past, partly due to his working relationship with the President in the first term.\nCook has tried to rekindle the relationship to aid the company once again since the inauguration. But it remains to be seen whether Apple will dodge the financial bullet again.\nIn the meantime, consumers will have to brace themselves for higher prices of goods across many industries, including Apple's product range.\nApple's premium pricing will likely get even more premium."

Features\n- Apps\n- Camera\n- Display\n- Security and Privacy\n- Apple Silicon\n- Ports\n- Accessories\n- Services\n- 2. iOS 18\n- Apple Intelligence\n- Photos update\n- Messages updates\n- Game Mode\n- Locked and Hidden apps\n- Home Screen, Lock Screen, and Control Center customization options\n- 3. Manufacturing iPhone in the United States\n- 4. Learn more about iPhone\nWhen Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone in 2007, it was meant to be a crossroads between communication, technology, and design. After a few years of ramping up the supply chain and gaining popularity, the iPhone began to dominate the smartphone market.\nSince the iPhone 4, no other device line has penetrated the market in the same way. Despite concerns from analysts that Apple was becoming too reliant on the iPhone, the company pivoted to services and software sales that fed off the increasing install base.\nHaving one central device act as a magnet to other portions of a company's business has been referred to as the \"halo effect,\" and this phenomenon plays a vital role in the Apple ecosystem.\niPhone Features\nThe basic slab-of-glass-and-aluminum design hasn't changed much over the lifetime of the iPhone. Interaction paradigms have shifted, and Apple has moved from Touch ID to Face ID, but overall the concept of a piece of glass displaying relevant information has remained constant.\nApple developed specialized software specifically for the iPhone and touch interfaces called iOS. The operating system shares many elements with its macOS cousin but focuses on a touch-only interface. As of iOS 13, Apple branched the OS into two different forks, iOS and iPadOS, to address hardware-specific features more directly.\nApps\nThe App Store operates as the sole storefront for software on iOS devices. Apple does not allow users to side-load apps from the web or use other app stores on iOS.\nMany anti-trust investigations surrounding the App Store and how business is conducted have shown no evidence of a rigged system or monopoly. Even so, some companies like Microsoft or third-party developers still call for investigations into Apple's business practices.\nAll apps and subscriptions sold in the App Store are subject to a 30% service fee on Apple Platforms. Subscriptions that retain a subscriber for over a year are only charged 15%.\nApple pre-loads every iPhone sold with several default apps, and they are all first-party apps. Once users finish the onboarding process on a new iPhone, they can go to the App Store and download free and paid apps via their Apple ID.\nApp updates are free, but some features may be locked behind paywalls called in-app purchases or IAP. Some apps charge a subscription fee instead of IAP, which will unlock features once a user subscribes.\nThe App Store makes most of the profits in the mobile app market despite having a smaller user base than Google Play.\nCamera\nThe smartphone camera was a relatively new concept when the iPhone was released in 2007. Since then, Apple has used its expertise in tying hardware and software together to produce industry-leading mobile photography engines that fit in your pocket.\nApple releases new photography-focused features with each new hardware or OS release, as consumers have shown that to be a high priority for new-device purchases.\nThe iPhone 14 Pro and newer can shoot 48MP photos using the ProRAW format to capture large and detailed photos. It is also capable of recording ProRES video in 4K.\nComputational photography has only improved in recent generations. For iPhone 16, Apple now offers reversible Photographic Styles that basically enable the user to apply styles and reprocess a photo as if it were freshly captured.\nLive Photos\nThe iPhone will capture 1.5 seconds of video before and after the camera shutter is pressed. This produces a playable video with sound to show off the events surrounding the image capture. When editing Live photos, users can select which frame is shown as the still, and all edits made to the still photo are applied to the entire Live Photo.\nSwiping up on a live photo within the Photos app will let users change the still image into a looping GIF or a long exposure. These changes show up as live tiles within the day-view of the Photos app.\nPortrait Mode\nWhen using Portrait mode, the iPhone will utilize multiple cameras to determine the depth map of what is being photographed, then produce a simulated bokeh effect live on the screen. The iPhone SE has only one camera but still takes portrait mode photos using algorithms to determine the borders of objects, which can detect even fine hair for use in the image.\nQuick Take\nA feature introduced in iOS 13 called Quick Take lets users quickly start recording a video when using the Camera app. While in the camera section of the Camera app, holding down the shutter button will begin recording in 1080p video. This is much faster than switching to the video mode if you're already snapping photos.\nNight Mode\nApple's Neural Engine can capture multiple exposures of a single scene and stitch it together into a fully exposed image. This is called Night Mode, and it occurs exclusively from every other camera operation. Bright scenes use HDR, medium scenes use standard exposure, and darker scenes default to Night Mode.\nWhen Night Mode is active, users can adjust the exposure time to multiple seconds, and the available time extends if the iPhone is used on a tripod. Capturing nearly pitch-black scenes or night skies is now easily done without technical skill. The resulting image will be exposed, so it still appears to be a nighttime or dark photo, an alternate approach to Apple's competitors.\nThe iPhone 12 Pro series added Night Mode portraits, and the entire iPhone 12 series supported Night Mode selfies, which carries over into newer models.\nDeep Fusion\nThis enigmatic feature was announced as a part of the iPhone 11 release in 2019. The user couldn't control or select it, and there is no setting anywhere in the OS for enabling it. The feature does not work with \"capture outside the frame\" enabled.\nWhen the shutter is clicked, the Neural Engine observes a still subject in medium lighting and automatically switches to multiple exposures. The iPhone will capture nine different images when this happens, with the one on the shutter press acting as the anchor image.\nThe Neural Engine and machine learning algorithms break all nine images down pixel by pixel and \"decide\" which pixel will remain in the final composite image. This results in a photo created by machine learning rather than based on what was captured by the sensor.\nA Deep Fusion photo will contain a higher amount of detail, color and shadow accuracy, and exposure when compared to images captured without the process. The feature is designed to be completely invisible, and users will not know if it has occurred or not without specialized software that searches metadata within the photo.\nApple upgraded its Deep Fusion system on iPhone 14 by moving it to earlier in the process, so images could retain more color and texture.\nDisplay\nSuper Retina XDR with ProMotion\n- Used on the iPhone Pro models\n- All-Screen OLED\n- HDR-ready\n- 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio\n- 120Hz variable refresh\n- True Tone\n- P3 Color\n- 1000 nits of brightness\nSuper Retina XDR\n- Used on the standard iPhone models\n- All-Screen OLED\n- HDR-ready\n- 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio\n- True Tone\n- P3 Color\n- 800 nits of brightness\nThe iPhone 11 and iPhone XR use a Liquid Retina HD display that is a LED with lower pixel density (326 PPI) and contrast ratio (1,400:1). The iPhone SE and older Touch ID-based iPhones use a screen called the Retina HD display, and it has the same specs as the Liquid Retina HD display but is a wide-screen display.\nSecurity and Privacy\nAny iOS device you buy comes fully encrypted by default. When setting up the device for the first time, Apple prompts users to secure their iPhone with a passcode or passphrase, then locks it with biometrics.\nBiometric data is end-to-end encrypted and stored within the Secure Enclave on the device. The actual biometric information is discarded. Instead, a mathematical representation of the data is stored in the Secure Enclave for comparison at each prompt.\nApple says privacy is a fundamental human right, and it designs its products with that in mind.\nFace ID\nAt the top of the iPhone, the sensor array contains infrared scanning technology that will collect depth and image data of the face being scanned every time Face ID is used. Machine learning algorithms also look for a \"live\" subject with eyes open and looking at the camera to prevent 3D models from fooling the technology.\nThe infrared scanner sprays the target with 30,000 dots to gather the face data. The eyes, nose, and mouth must be visible for the system to recognize the face when using traditional Face ID.\nHowever, Apple has added a new version of Face ID that uses the unique features found around a person's eyes to identify them. This allows for Face ID use while wearing a mask but isn't as secure as the traditional version.\nApple stated that Face ID is much more secure than Touch ID, and there is a 1 million to 1 chance of a random stranger unlocking your phone. Identical twins are the only exception, and Apple is looking to eliminate this anomaly through more advanced scanning technology.\nTouch ID\nThe Home Button on the iPhone acted as an iconic part of the device for its first ten years of existence until the iPhone X removed it in favor of a full-screen display. The iPhone 5S introduced Touch ID to the Home Button, which would scan for a fingerprint by taking a high-resolution image of the finger presented to compare to what is stored on the Secure Enclave.\nThe steel ring surrounding the Touch ID button would complete an electrical circuit with the user's finger\u2014 a fake finger or deceased person could not unlock the phone. The introduction of Touch ID brought secure encryption to the masses and still exists on some iPads and MacBooks.\nThe iPhone SE was the last iPhone with Touch ID. It was discontinued in February, 2025.\nApple Silicon\nApple builds its custom processors for the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and the Mac. By developing its chipsets, Apple can customize its software to work directly with the hardware in a way that competitors cannot imitate.\nThese chipsets are the brains behind Apple's software platforms, machine learning algorithms, graphics processing, and Apple Intelligence. The built-in Neural Engine makes many operations much more efficient, from taking photos to editing video.\nThe A16 was introduced with the iPhone 14 lineup but was only used in the Pro and Pro Max models. The iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus got the A15 instead, likely as a differentiator and cost-cutting decision.\nApple's A17 Pro is used in the iPhone 15 Pro models and is the first chipset built on the 3nm process. It has hardware-accelerated ray tracing to push video games even further.\nA18 is used in the iPhone 16 lineup including the entry iPhone 16e. It enables powerful graphics processing and Apple Intelligence.\nPorts\nThe iPhone has used the Lightning port and cable since it debuted in the iPhone 5. Apple had always shipped its iPhones with a single Lightning cable and 5W adapter until the iPhone 11 Pro, which shipped with an 18W adapter.\nThe iPhone 12 did not ship with any power adapter or headphones, a move beneficial to the environment and Apple due to lower costs. This means the box is much smaller, so plastic and rare metal use are reduced, and shipping weight and size are also reduced. This is the equivalent of removing 400,000 vehicles from the road.\nWhile the iPhone 13 was rumored to be \"portless,\" the actual release used a Lightning port as usual. Apple continued to ship the iPhone 13 without earphones or a charger.\nThe iPhone 14 was the last new product with a Lightning port as EU regulations helped spur Apple to USB-C. The first iPhone with USB-C was the iPhone 15 released in 2023, and the last with Lightning was the iPhone SE discontinued in 2025.\nGoing forward, all iPhones will use USB-C. Apple differentiates the port between standard and pro models by offering USB 2.0 on the former and USB 3.2 gen 2 on the latter.\nAccessories\nEntire industries exist to provide accessories to the iPhone user base of over 1.5 billion users. Apple offers a few first-party accessories built to offer unique experiences, but third-party manufacturers provide most of the accessories made.\nMade For iPhone Program (MFi)\nApple lets companies license proprietary hardware for their products to produce accessories that work directly with iPhone and Apple technologies. The program still exists despite the move from Lightning, but involves different products and chips for licensing.\nMFi Software:\n- AirPlay\n- CarPlay\n- HomeKit\n- GymKit\n- iPod Accessory Protocol (iAP)\n- MFi Lightning Game Controller\n- MFi Hearing Aid\n- Wi-Fi Accessory Configuration (WAC)\nMFi Hardware:\n- Authentication coprocessors\n- Headset Remote and Mic\n- Audio Module\n- Lightning Analog Headset Module\n- Lightning to Headset Jack Adapter Module\n- Lightning connectors and receptacles\n- Magnetic Charging Module\n- Smart Connector\n- MagSafe\nCases\nApple makes premium and silicone cases for the iPhone and changes out the options and colors available on a seasonal basis. Third-party companies exist by the dozen that build custom cases to personalize users' iPhones.\nApple eliminated leather from its lineup in 2023, shifting to a material called FineWoven.\nWhile cases usually exist to provide protection and add personality to a device, many features and technology that otherwise do not exist within the iPhone. For example, Lifeproof makes a case that can be fully submerged for underwater video or photography.\nThere are many specialized cases available that include infrared scanners, microphones, game controllers, and modular camera lens mounts. There was even a first-party Apple Smart Battery Case that added additional battery life with a unique design that was ultimately replaced by the MagSafe Battery Pack.\nThe iPhone 12 and later, including the phones themselves and official cases, have built-in magnets. Apple calls its magnet system MagSafe, recycling an old branding name from defunct MacBook chargers. The magnets will work with an ecosystem of accessories, including wireless-charging pads and docks, car mounts, wallets, and sleeves. Both Apple and hardware partners like Belkin are making official MagSafe accessories.\nAudio\nApple purchased Beats by Dre to absorb their music-streaming service and talent, but along with that came an entire hardware branch. The company still exists as a branch within Apple, and it sells Beats branded headphones with custom chipsets made by Apple.\nBeats By Dre with Apple Silicon:\n- Beats Studio\n- Beats Solo\n- Powerbeats\n- Powerbeats Pro 2\n- Beats X\nApple has its brand of earbuds as well. The AirPods came about as Apple removed the headphone jack from their devices and ushered in a new era of totally wireless audio. Since their release, third-party manufacturers have raced to mimic the all-wireless design, but very few have come close to capturing the same form factor, and battery life found within AirPods.\nApple first-party audio:\nMagSafe and charging\nThe iPhone can use wireless charging, fast charging over USB-C PD, and standard charging over USB. To take advantage of wireless charging or fast charging, users must purchase those accessories separately.\nApple announced but never released a proprietary wireless charging system called AirPower. The charging mat was meant to simplify charging devices wirelessly by enabling users to place their iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch anywhere on the mat. The charging mat was ultimately canceled when Apple allegedly could not solve overheating issues.\nApple has since released a new charging and accessory system called MagSafe, which charges the iPhone at 15W and connects via a circular magnet. It is assumed that MagSafe will ultimately replace the Lightning port and handle data and charging on future iPhones.\nWith the iPhone 13, Apple introduced a new MagSafe feature, adding Find My support to the MagSafe wallet. Rather than checking for a ping from a tracker, the system instead tells users when and where the wallet was detached from the back of the iPhone.\nThe MagSafe Battery Pack with a Lightning port is no longer for sale as of 2023. Apple could revive the product with a USB-C port, but there hasn't been any signs of it being announced.\nPhotography and Videography\nThe mobile phone camera is probably one of the most important things customers consider before purchasing. Since the iPhone became such a popular pocket camera, manufacturers have developed accessories and tools specifically to aid video and photo production.\nGimbles, mounts, flash sync systems, camera lenses, and iPhone-connected smart cameras have created a large market centered around the iPhone camera. When browsing the iPhone homepage on Apple's website, most of the page is dedicated to discussing photo and video capabilities.\nWhen paired with the right talent and equipment, the iPhone can produce competitive high-quality content. A few movies have been made with the iPhone, like \"Unsane.\" During the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple TV shows recorded episodes using the iPhone to observe proper quarantine and distancing.\nApple introduced ProRes support in its iPhone 13 Pro range to play into home movie making. Pro users can record 4K 60Hz ProRes directly to an external USB-C SSD with iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro.\nServices\nThe iPhone wouldn't be what it is today without the help of software and services. Apple has slowly built an entire software ecosystem surrounding its ever-popular pocket computer. Through each of these services, paid or not, Apple adds to the base value of every iPhone sold.\nAfter years of being told that Apple was too reliant on the iPhone as a single majority source of income, the company uses its services branch to build out and diversify its revenue. Services have become the size of a Fortune 500 company itself and continue to grow with each new effort from Apple.\nUsers can bundle Apple's paid services under a tiered subscription service called Apple One.\nSiri\nWhen the iPhone 4S was released with a virtual assistant, no one took it seriously. Initially, Siri could only act as a voice-controlled assistant that handled the most simple task or query.\nNow, Siri is a powerhouse piece of machine learning that exists on every Apple device sold. On the iPhone, Siri not only acts as a user-facing assistant with deep app connections and controls, and it also serves as the background intelligence that powers everyday operations.\nContacts, Calendar, Photos, and even the system keyboard rely on Siri Intelligence to manage information and surface what is most relevant to the user. Siri also acts as the brains behind Shortcuts, which can be activated via the assistant, through widgets, or in-app.\nApple does not directly monetize Siri, but it does use the assistant as a primary selling point for iPhone and accessories like HomePod mini and AirPods.\niMessage\nApple has often stated that the Messages app is the most used app on the iPhone. An iMessage is an Apple proprietary technology using end-to-end encryption to send messages via the web. Sending and receiving iMessages is exclusive to Apple products and has been cited as a significant source of consumer lock-in.\nWhen communicating via iMessage, a user sees \"blue-bubble\" messages, can share complex multi-media files, and use sticker packs and message effects. Apple also enhances iMessage group chats with unique features like message threads and custom group chat images.\nApple Music\nThe music streaming service that birthed Apple's push into services debuted in 2015. Apple Music is $10.99 a month and offers student and family plans. The service lives within the Music app on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and on the web.\nUsers can purchase music from iTunes when it is not available on the service, and it will be populated into their Apple Music library. If a user adds a physical CD to their Music app on macOS, the music will be synced across their account as well.\nApple Arcade\nApple Arcade is a monthly subscription service to games across all Apple platforms. A $6.99 per month subscription gains customers access to the entire game catalog and any new releases or updates.\nThe service has games from multiple genres and can be played with touch, though most titles support third-party controllers. Apple's push into gaming has made them embrace controllers like the Playstation Dualshock 4 and the Xbox Elite controller.\nApple TV+\nApple Studios is a new media branch within Apple that purchases and manages content for the video streaming service Apple TV+. The subscription costs $9.99 a month and exists on every Apple platform and several competitor devices.\nThe Apple TV app is needed for viewing Apple TV+ and is available in the following places:\n- Apple TV (Set-top-box)\n- iPhone\n- iPad\n- Mac\n- Roku\n- FireTV\n- Samsung Smart TV\n- LG Smart TV\n- PC\nApple News+\nApple News is a news aggregation app, and the company offers a premium content tier called Apple News+. The subscription is $12.99 per month and gives customers access to premium articles from newspapers and magazines.\nApple News Audio stories are exclusive to the iPhone application. Users can listen to articles read out loud and manage an independent queue of audio stories.\nApple Fitness+\nApple Fitness+ is a streaming fitness service with several workout types. Designed for Apple Watch users, it combines regularly updated workout videos with Apple Watch live health stats. It costs $9.99/month.\nApple revealed a SharePlay feature update to the service in 2021, enabling group workouts to be conducted remotely on multiple devices. In 2022, Apple removed the requirement for users to have an Apple Watch to participate in the service.\niCloud Storage\nThe term \"iCloud\" is a catch-all for Apple's syncing and storage service across devices and apps. The service portion of iCloud is specifically iCloud Storage.\nApple charges a monthly fee for the following storage tiers:\n- 5GB is free\n- 50GB is $0.99\n- 200GB is $2.99\n- 2TB is $9.99\n- 6TB is $29.99\n- 12TB is $59.99\nApple Card\nThe Apple Card doesn't seem to be a big earner for Apple but does add to the halo effect of capturing more customers who buy more Apple products. The card works best when used to buy more Apple products from Apple Stores and even allows customers to make interest-free purchases of nearly all Apple devices.\nDepending on the customer's credit score and other variables, the interest rate can vary from 13.24% to 24.24%. Purchases made with the physical card get 1% cashback, the card in Apple Wallet will net 2% cashback, and when used with specific partners and Apple itself, customers will get 3% cashback. Cashback rewards are automatically deposited into the customer's Apple Pay Cash balance.\nApple Card holders can open an Apple Savings account that can earn at 4.50% APY.\niOS 18\nAnnounced at WWDC 2024, iOS 18 is set to arrive in the fall alongside the iPhone 16. Here are some of the features users can expect to see.\nApple Intelligence\nThe most notable upgrade to Apple's upcoming operating systems is the integration of what Apple calls \"Apple Intelligence.\" Apple Intelligence is a personal-context based artificial intelligence. It is designed to work primarily on-device and help streamline tasks in a personal way.\nSome new features coming to the iPhone include on-device image generation, AI-powered writing and editing tools, and improved notification management.\nIt's worth noting that Apple Intelligence is only supported on the iPhone 15 Pro, M-series iPads, and M-series Macs.\nPhotos update\nA new Collections feature in iOS 18 automatically organizes the library by topics like Recent Days, Trips, and People & Pets. If you have a few favorite collections, you can pin them for quick access to the collections or albums most important to you.\nMessages updates\nApple has expanded Tapback options, now allowing users to respond to messages with any emoji, rather than the initial six it provided.\nThe new Send Later feature allows users to schedule when to send a message, which is perfect for ensuring you don't send someone a message when they're sleeping or when you want to schedule a birthday message.\nApple has confirmed that RCS support will arrive in iOS 18. RCS will improve messaging with Android devices by supporting read receipts, typing indicators, sending over Wi-Fi, and higher-quality media.\nThose who have an iPhone 14 or later will be able to use Messages via satellite. This new feature will allow users to send messages over iMessage and SMS, even without cellular or Wi-Fi service.\nWhen using iMessage, users can still use key features like sending emoji and Tapbacks, and anything sent via iMessage is end-to-end encrypted.\nGame Mode\nIn 2023, Apple introduced Game Mode to Mac \u2014 and a year later Game Mode is coming to the iPhone.\nGame Mode minimizes background activity while gaming. This allows the iPhone to sustain high frame rates for long gaming sessions.\nLocked and Hidden apps\nUsers can lock apps and require Face ID, Touch ID, or a passcode to unlock them, lessening the fear of handing off your iPhone to someone else. Locked apps will not appear in search and notifications, either.\nApps can also be hidden by dragging them to a hidden apps folder, requiring users to unlock the folder via biometrics or passcode before viewing the contents.\nHome Screen, Lock Screen, and Control Center customization options\nNow, on the Lock Screen, you can replace the controls at the bottom with something else, such as taking a note or quickly capturing a moment for your social media. If you have an iPhone 15 Pro, you can access these controls using the Action button.\nAs part of the expanded customization features, app icons, and widgets can now be scaled up to appear larger.\nUsers are no longer restricted to the standard app icon layout anymore. The new iOS 18 adds the ability to arrange apps along the bottom for quicker access or along the side to frame a favorite wallpaper.\nEach page of the Home Screen can feature a unique layout.\nManufacturing iPhone in the United States\nThere has been a lot of talk around the possibility of building an iPhone in the United States. Simply put, it isn't possible \u2014 at least not without incredible changes to the workforce, material availability, factories, and more.\nEven if Apple could perform final assembly in the United States by maximizing automation, most of the parts and materials would be sourced from abroad. The iPhone is a global product and the United States simply doesn't have the resources to make iPhone farm to table.\nThe discussions around manufacturing iPhone in the United States peaked in 2025 when the Trump administration levied extreme tariffs on countries around the globe. Tariffs were particularly high on China, which affects Apple the most.\nLearn more about iPhone\nLatest iPhone models:\n- iPhone 16e\n- iPhone 16\n- iPhone 16 Plus\n- iPhone 16 Pro\n- iPhone 16 Pro Max\nPrevious iPhone models:\n- iPhone 15\n- iPhone 15 Plus\n- iPhone 15 Pro\n- iPhone 15 Pro Max\n- iPhone 14\n- iPhone 14 Plus\n- iPhone 14 Pro\n- iPhone 14 Pro Max\n- iPhone 13\n- iPhone 13 mini\n- iPhone 13 Pro\n- iPhone 13 Pro Max\n- iPhone SE\n- iPhone 12\n- iPhone 12 mini\n- iPhone 11\nRumored iPhones:"

      "text": "Tim Cook\nAll about Tim Cook\nTable of Contents\nTim Cook is a private man whose accomplishments and philanthropy are centered around the company's desire to \"leave the planet better than we found it.\" Cook's stance on privacy, security, and user safety echos Apple's ethos and has often lead to government agitation over these issues.\nTime 100 list\nTim Cook was included in the Time 100 list for the most influential people of 2022. This is his first appearance in the list since 2015. Laurene Powell Jobs wrote Cook's profile for the piece, and Cook was on one of the cover variants of the publication.\n\"The intense pressure of setting and executing Apple's progression with deep precision, and of taking responsibility for the company's effects on society, is almost unimaginable,\" Laurene Powell Jobs wrote. \"Yet Tim does it with compassion and discipline, turning to nature to replenish his spirit.\"\nTim Cook in public\nAs Apple's CEO, Tim Cook spends a lot of time speaking publicly. Whether it's national news or a simple tweet, Cook's words have power as the CEO of the world's richest tech company.\nThe following are snippets of public comments made by Cook or events he attended to provide an overview of how he presents himself and his goals to the public.\n2025\nCook shared an anecdote about how Apple Watch saved his father's life in a podcast interview. The podcast is called \"Table Manners with Jessie and Lennie Ware.\"\n\"I haven't, but my father, when he was alive, he fell in the house and he was living alone,\" said Cook. \"And the other thing the watch does is send a notification to your family and to emergency services if you fall, because it detects the fall because of the accelerometer in [it].\"\n\"It notified emergency services and they came out to the house,\" continued Cook. \"He didn't respond to the door and so they kicked the door down \u2014 and it was a good thing they did because he was not conscious at the time.\"\nCook says his father was too focused on the door being kicked in by emergency responders to brag on Apple Watch saving him.\n2024\nTim Cook continued his global travels throughout 2024, but those weren't his most notable public appearances. Those took place in the United States in a more controversial manner.\nAfter Donald Trump was reelected as president, Cook congratulated him on Twitter then visited him in Florida for an in-person dinner. He then donated $1 million of his own money to the inauguration fund.\nThese actions raised a lot of questions, but big tech in general was trying to placate the incoming administration with donations and compliments. Apple was able to avoid becoming involved directly, unlike Amazon, Google, or Meta, because it never provided funds, but Cook was still able to stay close with the President.\nCook also attended the inauguration in early 2025. These moves are out of his standard playbook for appeasing President Trump and aren't dissimilar from how he handled things during the first term.\n2023\nAs far as public appearances go, 2023 was a standard year for Tim Cook. He made several trips overseas to meet with world leaders in China, India, and other important locations for Apple's business.\nApple Vision Pro was introduced during WWDC and Cook was often heard sharing that spatial computing was the future. As the year came to a close and everyone was discussing artificial intelligence, the conversation shifted.\nGoing into 2024, Tim Cook is talking about Apple's next big step in computing, and it could be more impactful than Apple Vision Pro \u2014 Apple AI.\n2022\nCook spent a lot more time in public venues in 2022 than in the previous few years since coronavirus concerns were reduced. While he didn't say much outside of his usual prepared remarks about Apple, he did attend some particularly unique venues.\nAside from Cook's usual appearances during WWDC and other Apple events, he was seen in several other high-profile locations like concerts and government offices. The usual \"world tour\" type of travel also resumed in 2022.\nCook attended the Grand Prix in October, an Adele concert in November, and toured Japan in December. While COVID-19 is still a threat, concerns were reduced in 2022 thanks to widespread vaccines and testing \u2014 allowing such public appearances by the tech CEO.\nHe was also the guest of honor at the sixth-annual FIRST Inspire Gala in November to celebrate and comment on STEM education, plus raise funding to support the nonprofit's mission. In a speech at that event, Cook called education the great equalizer.\n2021\n\"2020 was Apple's top year of innovation ever\"\nTim Cook spoke with a senior college student in Beijing, He Shijie. When asked about how Apple deals with the stresses of coming up with new products every year, Cook said that diversity leads to innovation.\n\"There's no one formula for innovation,\" Cook said. \"What we do is we have a culture of creativity and a culture of collaboration. These two things together, when they intersect, create enormous innovation.\"\n\"We must unite against racism in all its forms\"\nAfter increasing violence against Asian Americans due to racist rhetoric blaming them for the coronavirus, Cook shared a Tweet on the matter.\n\"The rising violence against the Asian community is a painful & urgent reminder that we must unite against racism in all its forms. There is no place for hate in our society. The team at Apple stands together & we will be donating to groups providing support to those affected.\"\n\"Privacy is one of the top issues of the century\"\nDuring an interview, Cook shared his feelings on user privacy and how it compares to other crises that humans face. \"We've got climate change \u2014 that is huge. We've got privacy \u2014 that is huge ... and they should be weighted like that and we should put our deep thinking into that and decide how we can make these things better and how do we leave something for the next generation that is a lot better than the current situation.\"\n2020\n\"Users should have the choice over the data that is being collected\"\nFacebook says App Tracking Transparency will cause irrevocable damage to the internet, and specifically its ad-based business model.\nCook shared the above image in a tweet that read: \"We believe users should have the choice over the data that is being collected about them and how it\u2019s used. Facebook can continue to track users across apps and websites as before, App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14 will just require that they ask for your permission first.\"\n\"Carbon-neutral economy\"\nDuring the United Nations Climate Ambition Summit, Cook said that everyone has a particular burden to act on the environment.\n\"The choice between the bottom line and the future of our planet is a false one, and each new green innovation offers the proof,\" Cook said. He then declared \"this is no time for changes of the margins,\" and that together the group can \"transition to a carbon-neutral economy and usher in a new era of inclusive opportunity.\n\"Big companies deserve scrutiny\"\nDuring an interview, Tim Cook was asked about climate change and how catastrophic events like the California wildfires can change opinions on the matter.\n\"I think the sum total of all of these \u2014 the wildfires in the west that's essentially burning millions of acres in the west, the hurricanes in the south in my hometown, the flooding that's taken place in the northeast and the mid-Atlantic region \u2014 all of these together, I do believe, will convince the people that are not currently convinced about climate change,\" Cook said.\nTim Cook's history at Apple\nAs Chief Executive Officer, Tim Cook is the face of Apple and the executive team. However, his gigantic impact on the company goes back long before he replaced Steve Jobs in 2011.\nJobs recruited him in 1998 from Compaq, where he had been vice president for corporate materials for less than a year. Before that, Cook had been at IBM for over a decade, and at that time, it would've seemed peculiar to leave the PC world to join Apple. The rivalry between IBM, plus its clone makers like Compaq, and Apple may have quietened down, but it was chiefly because Apple was failing.\nApple was in such a poor state that even Cook says that \"any purely rational consideration\" meant he should stay with Compaq. Yet for all its success, Compaq made clone PCs so superficially it was no different from any other commodity computer manufacturer.\nJoining Apple\n\"I was never going to find my purpose working someplace without a clear sense of purpose of its own,\" said Cook in a 2017 commencement speech. \"I tried meditation. I sought guidance and religion. I read great philosophers and authors. In a moment of youthful indiscretion, I might even have experimented with a Windows PC. And obviously, that didn't work.\"\nCook says that within minutes of being interviewed by Steve Jobs, he knew he wanted to join the company \u2013 and specifically that he wanted to help resurrect Apple.\nSteve Jobs had begun the turnaround of Apple when he rejoined in 1996. Famously, it was the iMac that began the climb back from the brink of bankruptcy. That visibility of the Jony Ive design team's work was crucial, yet the comparatively invisible role Cook took was at least as important. This was despite his not being seen as a \"product person\" consumed with design issues.\nIt would also have been unpopular, as it was by Cook's choice that Apple closed factories and shuttered warehouses. Instead, Apple outsourced manufacturing and began the same well-controlled production that it has to this day. Where previously Apple had made computers that would sit in warehouses for months before being sold, Cook got those months down to days.\nHe wasn't the only person to see the benefit of this. Before Cook joined Apple, PC maker Dell had pursued the same model with the logic that having few computers in warehouses meant the ability to adapt.\n\"If I've got 11 days of inventory and my competitor has 80,\" said Michael Dell, \"and Intel comes out with a new 450 megahertz chip, that means I'm going to get to market 69 days sooner.\"\nDell already had a comparatively streamlined production process because it built to order. Apple had to change a massive operation into one that should never again be caught out with too much unsold stock.\nInvesting smartly\nEqually as important as managing a stockpile-preventing process was Apple's need to predict sales. We're now familiar with Apple selling out of devices on launch day, and that is as much about the benefit of advertising its success as it is saying the predictions failed.\nNonetheless, that prediction of demand is treated so seriously that there is an entire department at Apple that works on it. The current head of retail, Deirdre O'Brien, was instrumental in demand prediction for much of her three decades at Apple.\nIt isn't just about guessing how many 5G iPhones will be sold, it's about knowing what technology Apple will need \u2013 and when.\nUnder Tim Cook, and with the benefit of greater financial stability, Apple would take the unusual step of making very long-term investments in technology such as flash memory. Getting that right meant not only that Apple would have the supplies that it was going to need in its iPods and iPhone, but that other companies would not.\nConsequently, Cook's work in streamlining and growing Apple became very well known in the industry, but it wasn't until 2009 that he really became anything of a public figure.\nTim Cook becomes CEO\nIn that year, he acted as overall CEO in the first of what would be three health-related absences by Steve Jobs. While Jobs continued to make decisions for the company, Cook actually ran it.\nShortly before Jobs's death in 2011 \u2013 and at the Apple co-founder's suggestion \u2013 Cook was formally made CEO of the company.\nThis made him the seventh Apple CEO, and he's been in the position for nearly 10 years. John Scully lasted for 10 years as CEO and Steve Jobs had the title for 14. It's still the case that Sculley ultimately had the most detrimental effect on Apple, and that Jobs had the most visibly successful. But Cook's tenure has seen the CEO role change more than ever.\nHe's taken time to recruit some key people, such as Angela Ahrendts, who ran Apple retail for five years. He's also reportedly been swift to cut people when needed.\nBoth as an individual and as CEO, Cook has been far more outspoken on social issues than any of his predecessors. Where Jobs may perhaps have cultivated the public perception of him as the face of Apple, Cook has directly presented himself as such over issues ranging from privacy and security to sexuality.\nPersonal life\nIn 2014, Cook came out as gay specifically to use his position to help others.\n\"[If] hearing that the CEO of Apple is gay can help someone struggling to come to terms with who he or she is, or bring comfort to anyone who feels alone, or inspire people to insist on their equality,\" he said, \"then it\u2019s worth the trade-off with my own privacy.\"\nMore recently, Cook has seen criticism over Apple's resistance to providing backdoor access to iPhones for the FBI, and for how he failed to factually correct President Trump during a joint press conference.\nHowever, whether one disagrees with Cook or not, the former resistance is in line with his and Apple's stated position about protecting our privacy. And the latter is a shrewd politician who knows very well what battles like DACA are ones he cares about.\nMore than Steve Jobs ever did, Tim Cook now also speaks publicly about issues where technology intersects with issues of politics and especially privacy.\nPhilanthropy\nWhile Cook is more visibly engaged with social and security debates, he does continue to remain a particularly private individual. For all that he is instantly recognizable, he's still very much the face of Apple instead of a celebrity in his own right.\nSo, for instance, it's chiefly only through required financial disclosures that we learn of how Cook regularly donates significant sums of money to charities.\nThat's part of a plan where Cook reportedly intends to fund his nephew's education and donate the rest of his money to charity.\nInvestments outside Apple\nUnsurprisingly, Cook concentrates his efforts and attention nearly exclusively on Apple, or on issues where the company plays a part. He does, however, regularly work out at a gym.\nIt was a chance use of a prototype shower head there that prompted him to make his only known personal investment. In 2015, he invested money in the shower company Nebia and reportedly takes an active interest in advising the firm, too."

      "text": "President Donald Trump on Monday delayed high U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods from snapping back into place for another 90 days, a White House official told CNBC.\nThose tariffs were set to resume Tuesday. But Trump signed an executive order hours beforehand that extends the deadline until mid-November, according to the official.\nThe delay was the expected outcome from the latest round of talks between U.S. trade negotiators and their Chinese counterparts, which took place in Stockholm in late July.\nIf the deadline were not extended, then U.S. duties on China would have shot back up to where they stood in April, when the tariff war between the world's largest trading nations was at its peak.\nAt that time, Trump had cranked up blanket tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, and China had retaliated with 125% duties on U.S. goods.\nBut the two sides agreed to pause most of those tariffs in May, after negotiators met for the first time in Geneva. The U.S. pared its tariffs back to 30%, and China dropped its levies to 10%.\nMonday's extension is the latest example of how Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs have shifted with little prior notice, a dynamic that has made U.S. trade policy unpredictable for many businesses.\nTrump has previously announced steep tariffs on countries or specific sectors, only to scale them back, tweak them or pause them days or weeks later.\nThe \"reciprocal tariffs\" he initially rolled out in early April, for instance, were quickly paused and then delayed multiple times before taking effect in an altered form last week.\nOn Sunday, Trump said he wanted China to \"quickly quadruple\" its orders of U.S. soybeans.\n\"This is also a way of substantially reducing China's Trade Deficit with the USA,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.\nChicago soybean prices rose Monday. It was not immediately clear if China has agreed to step up its soybean purchases in response to Trump's post."

      "text": "In a press gaggle, President Donald Trump said that some companies that have been hit the hardest by the blockbuster tariffs applied by the administration may get some relief \u2014 and nobody has been or will be hit harder than Apple.\nIt has been a rollercoaster week as President Trump finally enacted global \"reciprocal\" tariffs in an attempt to either bring manufacturing to the United States or be used as a negotiating tactic to lower other country's tariffs. The administration retaliated against China on Wednesday morning with a 104% tariff, then increased that tariff to 125%, and lowered every other tariff to the base 10% for 90 days.\nApple's stock bounced back slightly on the news of the pause, but after the market close, President Trump suggested that some companies may be considered for an exemption. He previously stated there would be no exemptions outside of the ones outlined already on \"Liberation Day,\" but like with the global tariffs, he's changed his mind, citing \"flexibility.\"\nA reporter asks him about potential exemptions while he's out doing a meet-and-greet with race car drivers. Trump states that exemptions are being considered for companies \"hit harder\" by tariffs, but decisions will be made based on \"instinct.\"\nThe question occurs at the 18-minute mark in the embedded video below.\nApple's reliance on China could mean an exemption, as it would be the company most affected by the continued 125% tariff. Price estimates place iPhone 16 Pro Max well over $2,000 when adjusted for the original 54% tariffs on China.\nCustomers rushed out to buy iPhones before Apple could announce new pricing, but now, that may not have been necessary. Exemptions may not occur, and anything could happen or change at a moment's notice, so Apple may continue shipping iPhones in massive quantities to stockpile during the 90-day reprieve.\nApple CEO Tim Cook played the long game and got the company in Trump's head early on as a good example. Cook donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund and attended the event, plus in-person dinners, to help keep Apple in good graces.\nAdditionally, Apple announced a $500 billion investment in the United States, which continues to be brought up by Trump in interviews. In today's Q&A, he even suggested that the $500 billion from Apple both a new announcement and for one plant \u2014 and neither statement is true.\nThe investment from Apple is a continuation of investments the company has made in the United States in recent decades, though previously more quietly. Apple has made these kinds of investments part of bigger PR pushes since the first Trump administration and announced a $430 billion investment during the Biden administration.\nEach United States investment announcement has occurred close to big political events like elections or potential regulation. The current $500 billion investment announced by Apple is just a continuation of the $430 billion it promised in 2021, which was added on from a $350 billion promise made in 2018, and so on.\nHowever, Tim Cook's playbook on handling Donald Trump allowed the latest announcement to come across as a result of Trump's policy. And so far, it seems to be working.\nPerhaps Trump's instincts will kick in and select Apple as a potential exemption from tariffs, which may have been Tim Cook's plan all along. So, regardless of the twists and turns of the roller coaster going forward, Apple may be safer than some."

      "text": "The White House and China have issued a joint statement, announcing a 90-day reduction in tariffs in a cool-down period to kick off negotiations for a new trade deal.\nOf all the US firms and consumers affected by Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs, ones importing goods from China have been hit the most. While Apple got a wide-ranging tariff exemption, other tariffs were unquestionably going to be applied at some point. Even with the exemptions, Apple had to perform logistical gymnastics to get the costs of tariffs down to $900 million in the next quarter.\nNow according to Bloomberg, the two countries have announced a 90-day pause in their tariffs. The pause does not entirely remove the recent tariffs, and it does not affect those tariffs introduced by Trump during his first administration \u2014 including a 20% one on smartphones.\nInstead, the US will reduce its 145% tariff on most Chinese imports to 30%, starting on May 14, 2025. The 125% Chinese tariffs on US goods will be dropped to 10%, presumably at the same time.\n\"We are in agreement that neither side wants to decouple,\" said treasury secretary Scott Bessent. \"[We] had a very robust and productive discussion on steps forward on fentanyl [which may lead to] purchasing agreements\" by China.\nWhat happens next\nThe White House announcement late on Sunday, May 11, said that further details would follow, with a briefing on Monday, May 12. The announcement followed two days of negotiations in Geneva, which Trump did not attend.\n\"Just remember why we're here in the first place,\" said US trade representative Jamieson Greer in the announcement. \"[The] United States has a massive $1.2 trillion trade deficit, so the President declared a national emergency and imposed tariffs, and we're confident that the deal we struck with our Chinese partners will help us to work toward resolving that national emergency.\"\nTrump previously announced a 90-day pause in tariffs for every country except China, although that really meant a reduction, instead of a pause. Plus, the reduction was to a level that in every case was still more than US firms were previously paying when importing from those countries.\nThen Trump did also threaten to halve that particular pause. One reason for stocks such as Apple's continuing to be volatile is the uncertainty over how changeable the situation is.\nAt close on Friday, Apple's stock was at $198.53. It has since risen overnight following the announcement to $212.00. Immediately prior to Trump's first announcements of the \"reciprocal\" tariffs, the shares were at $223.89."

      "text": "iPhone 17\nAll about iPhone 17\nTable of Contents\nThe iPhone 16 is here, but the rumor mill was already on what was coming next months before it was released. Due in September 2025, the iPhone 17 lineup is forecast to offer a few interesting updates to the smartphone series.\nThe rumors have solidified around four devices arriving, with a new \"iPhone 17 Air\" replacing the previous plus model in the lineup. The pro models are expected to see more significant camera upgrades and the entire lineup will have a new rear case design.\nThe iPhone 17 Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will have something called a camera bar instead of the usual camera bump. It's a shelf that extends across the entire back of the iPhone that will allow devices to be thinner without sacrificing camera capability.\nBeyond the usual processor upgrades and other minor spec changes, little else has been rumored. Some expect the aesthetic changes will help drive upgrades in spite of the feature set being a relatively iterative change.\nA prototype in the wild\nOn July 28, a social media user shared a photo of what seemed to be an Apple employee in San Francisco using a prototype iPhone. It is notable because, while Apple definitely tests their devices in public, they tend to be hard to spot.\nThis model was in a giant black case that obscured everything except the display, cameras, and sensors. The new camera bar design was obvious, since the flash and LiDAR are easily visible across from the cameras.\nAcross the last decade of iPhone releases, minus the iPhone X, the new generation of iPhone generally looked like the previous one. So, people taking notice of a prototype was much less at risk.\nWhile it was almost certain there would be camera bars in iPhone 17, this public sighting was the first real confirmation. Of course, some suspect the photo could have been staged with fake props or generated with AI to get social media clout, or even Apple could have intentionally created the scenario to generate hype.\nWhatever the case, the iPhone 17 lineup is expected to be announced in September as usual. All will be revealed then.\niOS 26 and iPhone\nApple did a lot of restructuring and rethinking around its operating systems during WWDC 2025. It revealed a system-wide redesign based on a material called Liquid Glass and it also renamed every OS to version 26.\niOS 26 leans heavily on animations and graphics for the Liquid Glass material, which is an indication of Apple's confidence in Apple Silicon. The material itself and how it catches light and color from the information around it could also hint at future device plans.\nWe've referred to the next iPhone as the \"iPhone 17\" because it is the one coming after iPhone 16, however, Apple could continue its naming restructure and introduce an \"iPhone 26\" instead. Names very rarely leak and there is nothing indicating such a name change is coming, but anything is possible.\nAs Apple Silicon used in iPhone gets more powerful, it will enable new experiences and UI designs that weren't possible before. Expect Apple to entice users with some enhancements to Liquid Glass that is exclusive to iPhone 17.\niPhone 17: Air, Pro, Max\nAs has been the case for generations, Apple will continue to offer its iPhones in two tiers, with a standard pair accompanied by two Pro models. Each pair will be differentiated by size, but will have similar core specifications.\nThe Pro versions will have better components, including a faster processor and better cameras, while the standard models will gain most of the features of the previous generation's Pro models.\nIt is currently expected that there will be the Pro and Pro Max versions as usual, but the standard versions may differ.\nDue to ongoing low proportional sales of the Plus models versus the rest of the group, Apple is rumored to switch it out for a new concept. Instead of just making a larger Plus version of the standard release, Apple could instead bring out the iPhone 17 Air.\nAs the name indicates, the Air will be a thinner version, though no-one knows exactly how thin. For reference, the iPhone SE is 0.29 inches whereas the M4 iPad Pro is 0.20 inches thick.\nReferences to a screen resolution that matches a rumor from Ming-Chi Kuo suggest Apple is indeed working on the middle-sized iPhone 17 Air. However, nothing about the name or form factor was included in this small discovery.\nBecause of the thin enclosure, there's a higher potential for the Air model to bend compared to thicker versions. Rumors point to the use of a titanium-aluminum alloy to add strength to the frame.\nApple is rumored to be looking into switching back to aluminum for the pro models' frames. Titanium is used to keep the frame light but durable and it is unclear why Apple would move away from the material, so, the rumor is seen as unlikely at present.\nColor options rarely leak, but one source suggests Apple could bring back a sky blue option for iPhone 17 Pro models. It could be similar to the popular Sierra Blue used in iPhone 13 Pro.\niPhone 17 Displays\nNormally, Apple will use two different screen sizes for its flagship smartphones. With the introduction of the Air, that may change to three.\nRumors have said that, alongside the 6.1-inch screens of the iPhone 17 model, and the 6.9-inch of the Pro Max, the Air will be between the two. Thought to be closer to the Pro Max sizing, it's expected to be 6.6 inches in size.\nOther changes to the display have also been offered, affecting all of the range.\nFor example, Corning is allegedly working on new harder glass that can perform better than Ceramic Shield displays in withstanding scratches. These same glass panels may also be more anti-reflective than previously produced.\nAlways-on displays, a trait of the iPhone 15 Pro models, may also move over to the standard editions, meaning all models will offer always-on functionality.\nThere has also been the claim that ProMotion will finally be available on all iPhone 17 models. However, since this is often referred to as a Pro-specific feature, that seems dubious.\niPhone 17 Cameras\nSo far, rumors about the new models have been about smaller features rather than major changes to the arrangement from the iPhone 16 generation.\nThe exception is the iPhone 17 Air, which is proposed to have only one camera, instead of the two or three of the other models. This is due to the constraints of creating a thinner device that still needs to fit in the same components as a slightly thicker model.\nFor the rear cameras, it has been proposed that the 2025 models will have adjustable apertures. The benefit is that users will be able to play with bokeh, the background blurriness, of a shot in-camera instead of computationally afterwards.\nVariable apertures would also be interesting with Camera Control, which could adjust the aperture by sliding the finger.\nA seemingly obvious report claims that the tetraprism lens used for the Telephoto camera won't make its way to non-pro iPhone 17 models, and definitely not the iPhone 17 Air.\nA leaker suggested Apple would shift to a horizontal bar on pro models with three cameras going across, but that was quickly shot down by more reliable sources. Instead, Apple will likely stick with the triangle shape.\nLeaked images shared in January show two iPhone backs in a plastic bag. They appear to show large camera modules on the rear with a large single cutout and a bar-shaped bump.\nThe origination of the image is unknown and may be fabricated. More reliable sources suggest Apple won't use the camera bar shape that is reminiscent of the Google Pixel.\nThe front camera may also get a few upgrades. Instead of a 12-megapixel sensor, the front could use a larger 24-megapixel version.\nReliable leakers have begun corroborating the camera bar rumors, so it's possible that Apple is going to use the design in iPhone 17. The iPhone 17 Pro Max would retain the triangle camera formation, but the bump would extend into a bar across the entire back of the iPhone.\nIf Apple does go with this significant design change, it would likely be for space consideration. More space for improved camera technology and more space for the battery and other components.\niPhone 17 A19\nFollowing the established pattern, Apple will use a \"Pro\" variant of its A19 chip with its Pro models, and the A19 for the standard edition smartphones.\nApple may also switch out the lens arrangement for a new one, going from a five-element plastic lens to a six-element edition.\nTo end users, the difference could mean one or two more cores in the Pro chip versus non-Pro, or some other form of performance or feature boost.\nThe A19 is anticipated to be the first to be released using TSMC's 2-nanometer production process. The die shrink offers multiple benefits, including power savings, improved heat dissipation, and a physically smaller size.\nTo go with the new chip, Apple could improve te amount of onboard memory. While the iPhone 16 uses 8GB of memory, the iPhone 17's Pro models may be upped to 12GB.\niPhone 17's Motherboard\nAn internal component change could end up making the iPhone 17 marginally lighter for users.\nApple is rumored to switch its motherboard production to a technique known as Resin Coated Copper. Using a laminate material instead of a bonding sheet, it will use deposited resin and laser ablation-carved copper to create the board.\nThis should result in a thinner motherboard, as well as one that will be easier to drill due to the lack of fiberglass. This will also help marginally reduce the time of production for Apple's supply chain, and possibly construction cost too.\nApple is also looking to shift to more house made components like the modem and Wi-Fi radio. It hopes to reduce its reliance on third-party manufacturers further like when it shifted to Apple Silicon in Mac.\niPhone 17 Release Date and price\nThere are no rumors about a change to Apple's well-established release schedule for the iPhone 17 generation. That means you'll still expect its introduction in early September 2025, with a release probably later that same month.\nThere is a lot of uncertainty around pricing at the moment due to extreme tariffs levied against nearly every country in the world by the United States. There is a lot of back and forth and no clear strategy with the tariffs, so there is no telling which ones will be in place or how high when Apple reveals the new models.\nEstimates suggest the iPhone 17 Pro could start at over $2,000 if the tariffs are in place in September."

Apple has worked to delay price rises, but now an analyst says it has no choice to add $50 to almost every model.\nSpecifically, Jefferies analyst Edison Lee claims that the price hike will come to the iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and the expected iPhone 17 Slim. That would mean that both the top of the range and the company's first major new design will be affected.\n$AAPL - IPHONE 18 PRICE HIKE EXPECTED: JEFFERIES\n\u2014 *Walter Bloomberg (@DeItaone) July 30, 2025\nJefferies analyst Edison Lee maintained a Hold rating and $188.32 price target on Apple. He noted strong iPhone demand in Q2 2025, with U.S. telcos reporting ~22% growth in equipment sales \u2014 the highest in six quarters. This\nPerhaps most significantly, if this is correct, it means that the iPhone 17 Pro will break the $1,000 barrier for the first time. Apple has kept its base configuration to $999 since the iPhone 11 Pro in 2019.\nThere is no direct equivalent to the predicted iPhone 17 Slim in the current iPhone 16 range. However, that new model is assumed to be replacing the iPhone 16 Plus, which currently starts at $899.\nThe one model not predicted to see a price rise is the base iPhone 17. That's expected to retain the $799 of its current equivalent, the iPhone 16.\nJeffries says that the price rise is specifically to offset the impact of the tariffs, and from unspecified rising component costs.\nBack in May 2025, it was reported that Apple was looking to raise prices because of tariffs, but also to find a way to avoid blaming Trump. That's because Trump's administration exploded at Amazon over a claim, later denied, that the retailer would display exactly how much the tariffs were adding to the cost of items."

      "text": "A made-in-America iPhone seems to no longer be a priority for President Trump after Apple's additional $100 billion investment in the United States and local component use.\nNothing really changed with Apple's latest $100 billion investment announcement. The iPhone is still assembled overseas, and something like 95% of parts are sourced from outside the United States.\nHowever, the announcement and commemorative plaque seem to strike enough investment in the United States to appease President Trump in the short term. During the press briefing, Apple CEO Tim Cook was asked about final assembly in the United States, in which President Trump interjected, dismissing the question.\n\"He makes many of the components here, and we've been talking about it, and the whole thing is set up at other places, and it's been there for a long time, so in terms of cost and all,\" Trump said on Apple's difficulties bringing final assembly to the United States. \"But I think we may incentivize him enough that one day he'll be bringing that \u2014 but he brings most of the stuff \u2014 look, he's not making this kind of an investment anywhere else in the world, not even close.\"\n\"Apple's coming back to America,\" Trump concludes.\nThe statement was made as Cook tried to explain that its investment will bring thousands of jobs and more American hardware to iPhones sold around the globe. Trump's statement reflects that while he'd like to see iPhones built in America, Apple's efforts in the short term are enough for now.\nThe Trump playbook\nThe dismissal of building iPhones in the US was shared shortly after President Trump revealed that companies already investing in the United States would be exempt from new 100% semiconductor tariffs. While it remains to be seen how Apple would have been affected by these new tariffs, they will now incur no cost.\nApple and Cook are playing the long game with the Trump administration. The plaque and additional $100 billion investment is just another part of Cook's many attempts to keep Apple in good favor.\nApple and Cook will still exist well after the Trump administration ends, so if it is going to do so without taking on excessive and unnecessary costs, it has to play along with the administration's minimum expectations. Perhaps all of this will lead to iPhone 17 launching with minimal, if any, price changes in September."

      "text": "Apple's production in India reportedly surged in the early stages of 2025, with up to 17% of global iPhone production stemming from the country.\nApple has been gradually expanding its manufacturing operations, shifting away from a China-centric approach in favor of one that also exists in India. Over the years, it has seen progress, but it has apparently exploded in 2025.\nAccording to data from Canalys seen by Yahoo, iPhone production in India has risen 53% year-over-year, hitting 23.9 million units.\nThat production boom is expected to continue further. While it currently supplies approximately 16% to 17% of iPhones in the world, which has grown in just a few short years, it is projected to reach a 25% share by 2027.\nThat acceleration is likely to be driven by moves such as Foxconn's $1.5 billion investment in the country.\nApple has also been moving towards producing newer models in India, including high-end models such as the iPhone 16 Pro. It is almost certain that the iPhone 17 will be produced in some capacity in India too, with it reportedly entering trial production in the country.\nPart of this shift is caused by the ongoing U.S. tariff battle, which has seen China become a major target of U.S. President Donald Trump.\nThe backdrop of escalating tariffs prompted a change in Apple's import patterns. In May, Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed that half of the iPhone sales in the United States in the second quarter involved iPhones produced in India.\nThe Indian government also saw this change too. In May, a report revealed an increase in the value of Apple exports by 116% in April versus the same month one year prior.\nNot just manufacturing\nThe shift in India isn't just from building iPhones. It's from buying them too.\nThe report adds that, in terms of demand in India, Apple is now in the top five smartphone brands sold in the country. Revenue from iPhone sales in India for Q1 2025 is up 28% year-on-year.\nThe reason for this is said to be due to an increase in premium device adoption, as well as tempting financing offers.\nThe demand is certainly something Apple has noticed. It is currently in the middle of building a new Apple Store in Mumbai's newest shopping mall, the Sky City Mall, as well as reports of one being made in Bengaluru's Phoenix Mall of Asia."
