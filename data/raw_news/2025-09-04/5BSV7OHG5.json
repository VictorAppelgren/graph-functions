  "title": "It's OK AI hasn't lived up to the hype some executives promised. But people's patience might not last forever.",
  "description": "That's not to say AI is a bust. Instead, AI is just in the midst of its \"meh\" era. And that's not necessarily a bad thing!",
  "content": "Death, taxes, and Googlers posting funny memes about company news. The tech giant's employees have a habit of reacting to big news via an internal message board. When a judge ruled favorably in Google's antitrust case, they didn't disappoint. (BI's Alistair Barr thinks the celebration could be premature, though.)In today's big story, AI might be in its \"meh\" era, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.What's on deck:Markets: Elliott Management is taking on Pepsi, but activist campaigns aren't as scary as they used to be.Tech: Amazon wants to help companies design custom AI agents, internal documents show.Business: A weekend in the Hamptons as it wraps up its busy season.But first, hype vs. reality.If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.AI is falling short of some of its executives' sky-high promises, and that's okay.That's not to say AI is a bust. Instead, as BI's Hugh Langley smartly puts it, AI is just in the midst of its \"meh\" era. And that's not necessarily a bad thing!Since ChatGPT first graced us with its presence, the proclamations have only gotten bigger and bolder. At this point, every convo about AI is almost like a Mad Lib:\"INDUSTRY is going to get upended by generative AI. At least SHOCKINGLY HIGH PERCENTAGE of jobs will be lost. It's not worth it anymore for kids to get INDUSTRY-RELEVANT DEGREE when all the robots will be doing the work. It's time to get a job as a BLUE-COLLAR JOB.\"Three years later, things haven't always panned out as some have predicted. Sure, there have been job disruptions. But generating dollar signs from leveraging AI has been a tougher nut to crack. A recent study published by MIT reported that only 5% of the companies it studied converted AI into actual revenue.So are the AI absolutists screwed?Short answer: No.Like previous tech developments, AI's hype is just surpassing its reality. It shouldn't come as a surprise. AI companies are happy to make big promises to keep the money flowing with billions, maybe even trillions, of dollars on the line.And progress is being made. AI will almost certainly change the way we do things. (There I go making a Mad Lib.) But the change will be a lot more gradual and incremental than a flip of the switch.Again, that's not a bad thing. Remember the tortoise and the hare? Slow and steady wins the race.However, this relay comes at a high cost. AI bills are mounting. And the real issue could be whether people are willing to wait.1. Finance bro vs. bot. In a recent survey, more than 500 Morgan Stanley interns weighed in on AI. While about 96% reported using the tech \u2014 and more than 52% said they subscribe to a paid version of an AI tool \u2014 some were concerned about it replacing Wall Street jobs. A report from ThoughtLink shared how the tech could reshape four corners of investment banking.2. The markets are entering a \"postmodern\" cycle. That's according to Goldman Sachs strategists, led by chief global equity strategist Peter Oppenheimer. Even though it's the fourth long secular bull run since World War II, this era is different. The firm shared how investors should navigate it.3. Why today's activist campaigns are more bark than bite. Billionaire Paul Singer's Elliott Management is taking a $4 billion stake in Pepsi. The activist investor wrote in a letter to the company that it believes Pepsi's stock could rise by more than 50%. Pepsi's C-suite doesn't need to worry, though: These big-name campaigns rarely turn into a huge fight anymore.1. Amazon is set to enter the AI agent race in a big way. The company is testing a new agentic, AI-powered workspace software called Quick Suite, which allows companies to design custom agents for business and team needs, according to internal documents reviewed by BI. Several companies have already gotten a private preview.2. Meta's performance review is in. Christelle Dernon, a top policy manager at the Big Tech company, didn't miss the chance to rate her employer when she announced she was leaving. She said it \"Met Most\" of her expectations in a post on Meta's internal forum.3. The Big Tech backlash is over. After being ruled a monopoly in 2024, Google got off pretty easy when a federal judge ruled it could keep Chrome. That constitutes more than just a win for the search giant \u2014 it shows the push to rein in Big Tech is done, writes BI's Peter Kafka.1. Brand crossovers are getting weirder. From Kate Spade's Heinz ketchup packet purse to Chipotle's dorm collection with Urban Outfitters, random brand crossovers are everywhere these days. If done properly, experts say they can capitalize on nostalgia and boost cultural relevance. The collabs will need to pass Gen Z's authenticity radar, though.2. Instagram on the big(ger) screen. The social media app finally launched an iPad-specific version after 15 years of not having one. BI's Katie Notopoulos tried it and said it was \"like the Cadillac of doomscrolling.\"3. It's not all picture-perfect in the Hamptons. BI's Alice Tecotzky spent Labor Day weekend in Long Island's eastern enclave. She discovered some local tensions over wealth were bubbling up along with some surprising revelations.Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Klarna's F-1 filing also notes that it allows customers to choose to make donations to the WRLD Foundation through its app and website as part of its environmental, social, and governance initiative.\nFounded by Nina Siemiatkowski in 2018, Milkywire's website says it delivers climate impact solutions in areas including carbon removal, nature restoration, and protection. Klarna's F-1 filing also states that Milkywire provides it with other services and tools, including \"product development, digital integrations, websites, campaigns, content creation and other digital solutions.\"\nKlarna said in the filing that it underwent a thorough screening process before engaging Milkywire for its services and that it believes the fees paid to it are competitive. It added that the partnership was approved by its board of directors, but that Siemiatkowski recused himself from the process, in line with its conflict of interest policy.\nKlarna declined to comment.\nKlarna isn't the only company to engage with organizations linked to its executives' families. Google has previously invested in genetics firm 23andMe, which was cofounded by Anne Wojcicki, who was married to Google cofounder Sergey Brin at the time.\nKlarna's disclosure comes as it readies for its IPO next week, seeking to raise up to $1.72 billion in its debut on the New York Stock Exchange.\nHave a tip?

      "text": "- Klarna has been reassigning employees to customer support after being placed in its talent pool.\n- CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said in February that \"nothing will be as valuable as humans.\"\n- Engineers and marketers are among those being moved, three employees told Business Insider.\nKlarna is redeploying workers to customer-support roles after its CEO acknowledged that earlier cost-cutting went too far.\nA number of employees of the buy-now, pay-later firm, including engineers and marketing people, are being told their jobs are no longer needed. Instead, they are being redirected into customer support positions via an internal talent pool, according to three current employees who spoke on condition of anonymity since they were not authorized to speak publicly.\nKlarna, which on Tuesday unveiled plans to go public, has previously talked up its AI plans. It has eliminated over 1,200 external SaaS tools, restructured teams, and placed some employees in the talent pool, Business Insider previously reported.\nBut the latest move points to a growing reality: doubling down on AI isn't always the cure-all that companies expect. AI can help companies trim costs and streamline operations, but overreliance on the technology can lead to unintended consequences.\nA spokesperson for Klarna declined to comment.\nWhile many companies, including Amazon, have said they will shrink their workforces because of AI, others are finding that AI has its limitations, particularly in customer service roles. The use of AI chatbots in customer service can sometimes lead to inaccurate information, or so-called \"botshit.\"\nMcDonald's removed its Automated Order Taker technology from over 100 restaurants last year after a series of mishaps with the tech went viral. Starbucks has said it is doubling down on baristas, not AI, to improve its customer experience.\n\"We just had an epiphany: in a world of AI nothing will be as valuable as humans,\" Klarna CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski said earlier this year. He added that the company would start working toward being \"the best at offering a human to speak to.\"\nKlarna plans to raise $1.27 billion in an IPO, according to an SEC filing on Tuesday. The company had planned to go public earlier this year but pulled back in April amid market uncertainty around President Donald Trump's tariff announcements.\nEmployees across several areas of Klarna \u2014 business operations, analytics, marketing, engineering, and legal \u2014 have been told their role or area of focus is no longer a priority before being placed in the talent pool to await reassignment. The number of employees placed in the talent pool and later reassigned to customer support roles is unclear.\nThe talent pool is a group of employees whose roles have been eliminated, but who remain on the payroll while they await new opportunities within Klarna that align with their skills. If no suitable role is found, they may either be offered an exit package or choose to resign. Klarna insiders previously likened it to \"a sneaky way of carrying out quiet layoffs.\"\nSome employees who were placed in the talent pool, including a few who were in senior positions, were later offered roles in the company's customer success team, which is led by chief operating officer Camilla Giesecke, the employees told Business Insider.\nEarlier this year, Klarna introduced a weekly Monday session known as \"Action Day,\" bringing together employees from multiple divisions to review customer app recordings and purchase flow data from user experience analytics platform Fullstory, the people Business Insider spoke to said.\nThe initiative was designed to analyze purchasing behavior and identify barriers that prevent customers from completing transactions. Initially held as a full-day event, the meetings were scaled back to half a day in May after some employees were concerned the format was cutting too deeply into time needed for other projects, the three people said.\nThe company said last year that its AI assistant was doing the work equivalent to 700 customer support agents as it froze hiring except for engineers. Last August, Siemiatkowski said in an X post that \"AI allows us to be fewer in total.\"\nIn an interview with Bloomberg in May, Siemiatkowski said his cost-cutting push had gone too far and that he was testing out a gig work model to hire customer service agents.\n\"As cost unfortunately seems to have been a too predominant evaluation factor when organizing this, what you end up having is lower quality,\" he told Bloomberg. \"Really investing in the quality of the human support is the way of the future for us.\"\nCorrection: September 3, 2025 \u2014 An earlier version of this story stated that Sebastian Siemiatkowski said AI-driven cost cutting went too far. His comments were actually about cost cutting more broadly, not AI implementation.\nHave a tip? Contact this reporter via email at jmann@businessinsider.com or Signal at jyotimann.11.

      "text": "- A US judge ruled against breaking up Google, handing the company a big victory.\n- The news sent the stock of parent company Alphabet soaring on Wednesday.\n- Apple also rallied on speculation it will get a similarly positive result in antitrust court.\nThe move: After a difficult day for tech stocks yesterday, Google parent Alphabet soared as much as 9% on Wednesday, while Apple climbed nearly 4% at intraday highs.\nAlphabet is now up more than 20% in 2025, while Apple pared its year-to-date loss to 5%.\nWhy: On September 2, a US judge rendered a verdict that Google would not be broken up, a decision that follows months of deliberation and speculation from investors.\nThe judge also ruled that Google will not be forced to sell its Chrome web browser or Android operating system, an order that will stay in effect for the next six years.\nIn August 2024, Mehta ruled that Google had engaged in illegal practices to maintain its digital search monopoly. This led to speculation that the dominance held by a few leading tech companies could be ending, as a forced Google breakup could lead to similar action against its peers such as Apple.\nSince Google appears to have avoided severe regulatory action, though, investors have less cause for concern.\nWhat it means: Considered the most significant antitrust case in decades, the landmark ruling carries major implications for both Google and the broader tech sector.\nLike Google, Apple has faced accusations of engaging in monopolistic practices, such as having an illegal hold over the smartphone market. The fact Google has avoided a forced breakup suggests that other companies are likely to do the same.\nThis may be seen as a bullish indicator for tech stocks beyond just Alphabet and Apple, as many of the sector's other big names have faced similar antitrust accusations.\n\"In our view, the benign remedy ruling is a significant positive for GOOGL shares and should alleviate the overarching regulatory overhang,\" Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Deepak Mathivanan said in a recent report."

      "text": "- AI may be responsible for up to a third of investment banking tasks by 2030, a report found.\n- But the impact will vary across roles, from equity capital markets to trading and M&A.\n- Here's how AI could reshape 4 different investment banking career paths.\nEveryone says artificial intelligence will change the way we work. But on Wall Street, where investment banking jobs range from high-touch dealmaking to split-second trading, what will that actually look like? And who's most at risk?\nEach role in financial services will be impacted differently as AI spreads through the industry, a process that's well underway. JPMorgan and Citi have rolled out in-depth AI strategies; Goldman Sachs has made its AI chatbot sidekick available firmwide.\nBusiness Insider spoke to Sumeet Chabria, a former Bank of America executive turned founder of consultancy ThoughtLinks, whose firm recently produced a report forecasting precisely which tasks in the investment banking world will be overtaken by AI, and what humans will be doing.\nHe offered detailed case studies covering four specific areas: M&A, sales and trading, equity underwriting, and debt underwriting \u2014 for each one, breaking down the roles AI will likely to overtake, and where humans will remain indispensable.\nChabria's research predicts that AI could transform as much as 33% of IB workflows by 2030, meaning it will handle everything from data analysis and document drafting to simulating market scenarios. Here's a look at how the dynamic between people and the machines will play out for four specific Wall Street career tracks by 2030.\nMergers & Acquisitions\nWhat bankers will be doing:\nM&A bankers will review potential risks, provide important context, and take the lead on final due diligence \u2014 especially in complex areas like tax, reputation, and integration planning, where human judgment is essential. They'll continue shaping deal strategy, advising clients, and leading negotiations.\nWhat AI will be doing:\n- AI agents will work around the clock scanning public/private data, news, and CRM platforms to identify strategic targets.\n- AI will flag operational, market, and geopolitical risks, delivering summarized insights to deal teams.\nForecast change by 2030: 30%\nEquity Underwriting\nWhat bankers will be doing:\nLead ECM bankers will still oversee bookbuilding in real time, step in to adjust investor allocations when needed, and handle negotiations with key investors. They will also remain in charge of taking deals live, how a company's story is told, and getting sign-off from company leadership. Even with advanced models, understanding investor mood and managing tricky company situations will require human judgment and experience.\nWhat AI will be doing:\n- During live deals, AI tools will track investor orders, test different ways to allocate shares, and adjust pricing on the fly. Before the launch, they will run simulations based on market trends and how investors are likely to respond.\nForecast change by 2030: 32%\nDebt Underwriting\nWhat bankers will be doing:\nDCM teams will keep evaluating the best time to issue debt based on the company's goals and their relationships with investors. While AI may draft documents, bankers \u2014 working together with legal counsel \u2014 must ensure they meet legal standards, align with rating agencies, and comply with regulations. Their judgment will be crucial in shaping language and guiding the market narrative.\nWhat AI will be doing:\n- Agents will monitor rate curves, peer issuance, and investor trends to recommend deal timing and structure.\n- Generative AI will draft offering documents, term sheets, and covenants using internal data and compliance inputs.\nForecast change by 2030: 34%\nSales & Trading\nWhat bankers will be doing:\nTraders will use AI recommendations to make trades on an even greater scale than they are doing now, intervening more heavily in disorderly conditions. They'll continue to manage inventory, client objectives, and risk appetite. Human oversight will be crucial in calibrating algorithmic boundaries, ensuring compliance, and preserving client trust in high-stakes environments.\nWhat AI will be doing:\n- AI systems will provide real-time execution recommendations based on liquidity, venue analysis, and timing.\n- In volatile markets, quote engines will adjust spreads dynamically within set risk bands.\nForecast change by 2030: 32%\nHow is AI really showing up in your day-to-day? Is it living up to the hype? Take our quick, anonymous survey and tell us how \u2014 or if \u2014 AI is changing your job."

      "text": "- Brand crossovers are getting more interesting, with more unexpected collaborations.\n- Branding experts say the partnerships help brands break through noise and boost cultural relevance.\n- Successful crossovers often capitalize on emotions and the current embrace of nostalgia.\nBrand crossovers are everywhere right now \u2014 and getting weirder.\nKate Spade released crossbody bags in the form of giant Heinz ketchup packets. Urban Outfitters released a back-to-school dorm collection with Chipotle that included a lamp shaped like a bag of chips and a metallic blanket that lets you wrap yourself up like a burrito. And Tecovas released $345 cowboy boots made with the same red vinyl used for Chili's restaurant booths and stamped with chili peppers, of course.\nWhile collaborations like this aren't new, branding experts said the recent \u2014 and unexpected \u2014 crossovers show just how hard it is for brands to break through the noise. Capitalizing on another brand's \"cool\" can up the cultural relevance of both \u2014 but they have to watch for pitfalls.\n\"We have so much information coming at us every which way from our phones and laptops and everything in between,\" said Anna Crowe, brand strategist and CEO of Crowe PR. \"So we see these brands coming together to really create this unique, dynamic effect and get the attention of customers.\"\nBrand crossovers can be a relatively straightforward way to broaden a customer base. If two brands share some common through-line and a collaboration feels natural, it can be an effective way to tap into each other's audience or double down on the existing audiences they share.\nA straightforward example is Oreo and Reese's, which launched new treats in August that combined the flavors of both iconic brands. Oreo previously told Business Insider that it hopes to leverage the partnership to tap into Reese's cache with Gen Z.\nHowever, even when two brands don't necessarily seem like a natural fit, experts said they'll typically share something that makes the crossover work, like a similar audience or a shared value.\nYou don't immediately think of designer handbags when you think of a Heinz condiment, but Megan Lang, head of global Heinz brand communications and creativity, told Business Insider in an email that the crossover with Kate Spade was \"grounded in shared brand values \u2014 mastery, craftsmanship, and a commitment to the highest quality.\"\nThe collaboration between Chili's, a restaurant chain, and Tecovas, which sells cowboy boots for several hundred or even thousands of dollars, seemed a bit random to some consumers online. But the boots and belt in the collection sold out within minutes. Crowe said the campaign was successful because its messaging tapped into an \"homage to Americana\" that felt true to both brands.\nGreat crossovers tap into emotions or nostalgia\nThe best collaborations create an emotional connection with the audience, the branding experts said.\n\"It creates this combined dopamine effect: getting people excited, and then those positive feelings get connected back to the brand that's introducing them,\" Eric Schiffer, an expert in brand strategy and chairman of Reputation Management Consultants, told Business Insider.\nAs for why there seem to be so many crossovers between food and fashion brands, it could be because both are key parts of everyday life and pop culture, Crowe said. Both feel deeply personal \u2014 fashion is expressive, while food is emotional and nostalgic.\nFor McDonald's recent collaboration with Pac Sun, which included vintage-inspired tees plastered with hamburgers, the announcement said that both brands were \"rooted in nostalgia,\" a concept that often comes up in recent collaborations.\nA coming Taco Bell-Hollister collaboration, which will be officially unveiled later this year, is also betting that Y2K-era nostalgia will reel in customers, Taco Bell CMO Taylor Mongtomery told Business Insider.\nWatch out for Gen Z's authenticity radar\nCrossovers generally have different goals: to surprise and delight fans, make headlines, or reposition a brand to a new audience. Authenticity is essential for any of them to be successful.\nPick the wrong brand, and a brand crossover could feel like a reach for attention. Pick the wrong time or do too many collabs, and it could come off as a bit much.\n\"Hopefully you're coming from a position of strength, not a position of desperation,\" said Michael Goldberg, professor of design and innovation at Case Western Reserve University's Weatherhead School of Management.\nCrowe said she thinks \"Gen Z especially has a radar for inauthentic moves that brands can make and can be very vocal about it online.\" She said the storytelling used in the campaign can be just as important as the mash-up itself.\nBusiness Insider previously reported that Gen Z, in particular, demands well-integrated authenticity from marketing campaigns.\nWhile many crossovers aim to go viral, Crowe said that online attention can often come as quickly as it goes. Ideally, brands should think about how that collaboration fits into their long-term strategy and ensure it doesn't dilute the overall brand identity.\nBrands looking for inspiration could consider looking to the \"ultimate cross-brand collaboration,\" as Schiffer put it, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. The popstar and football star announced their engagement last month after two years of their relationship dominating headlines.\n\"That's a one plus one equals 10. In that case, it's not only positive, but both coming together create something bigger than the parts,\" Schiffer said, adding they are \"highly emotionally intelligent brand managers who know their audience cold.\""

      "text": "- Google investors and employees are cheering the recent antitrust decision.\n- The ruling shifts power, creating risks for the search monopolist.\n- Syndication, data sharing, and an end to exclusive paid distribution deals give rivals an opening.\nGoogle investors and employees are celebrating after what seems like an emphatic antitrust win. The party could be premature.\nThe company dodged the most draconian remedies, such as a forced divestiture of Chrome or Android, or an outright ban on paying for distribution.\nStill, Bernstein analysts argue the Department of Justice remedies, while seemingly mild, actually carry hidden risks that could leave Google worse off than before.\n\"The remedies shift power from Google,\" Mark Shmulik, a senior internet analyst at Bernstein, wrote in a note to investors. The ruling is \"a net-negative from today's base case, which may not align with investors' immediate reaction,\" he added.\nHe laid out which remedies were better and worse than expected. Only one was better, while two outcomes were worse.\nOpenings for rivals\nOn the surface, the decision looked favorable: Google keeps control of its critical distribution engines, Chrome and Android.\nThat being said, eliminating the exclusivity in contracts changes the competitive dynamics of Search.\nApple, for example, is now free to route different types of searches \u2014 app downloads, product queries, local services \u2014 to partners such as Amazon, DoorDash, or OpenAI. That flexibility transforms Apple into a powerful orchestrator, able to divert traffic to whichever partner pays most or best fits user queries.\nThe remedies for AI-driven competition go further. Google can no longer sign exclusive deals for Gemini or other generative AI products, giving OpenAI and rivals such as Anthropic the ability to carve out market share on devices and browsers.\nIn Bernstein's view, that creates \"small windows where competitors can squeeze through.\"\nSyndication is worse than expected\nAnother important change is that Google must syndicate portions of its search results and text ads to \"qualified competitors\" for up to 40% of queries over the next five years.\nThis arrangement gives challengers a shortcut to offering credible search experiences while piggybacking on Google's ad base.\n\"The comprehensiveness of the syndication ruling was more severe than we expected,\" Shmulik and his colleagues wrote.\n\"The biggest risk is that, combined with exclusivity provisions being struck down, Apple and ChatGPT could stand up competitive search results along with 'borrowing' Google's ad products and army of advertisers,\" the Bernstein analysts added.\nA valuable look inside Google's search index\nData sharing rules, though watered down, also provide rivals with enough user interaction data to start closing the quality gap on long-tail search queries.\nCompetitors, including newer generative AI rivals, will get a one-time snapshot of Google's prized Search Index, the data goldmine that the search giant has spent decades building. Most rivals in the past have struggled to index web content on a scale anywhere near what Google has accomplished.\nGoogle is also being forced to share user click and query data from its search engine at least twice with competitors. That will show rivals what results users clicked on. This is extremely valuable information because it will reveal which search results work best and why. That's the type of data that can help develop and refine rival search and generative AI services.\nGoogle's edge has always been that it sees which results click with users on an unprecedented scale and can use that to tweak future search results. That creates a better experience, attracting more users and clicks in a feedback loop that's hard to match. Now, rivals get a peek inside this process.\n'Monster win' for Apple\nTogether, these remedies offer Apple and OpenAI, in particular, immediate leverage and accelerate their ability to stand up viable alternatives.\n\"This is a monster win for Cupertino,\" Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, wrote, referring to Apple's hometown in Silicon Valley.\nWhile Google investors and employees were relieved that the remedies avoided a structural breakup, Bernstein analysts argue near-term competitive risks have grown.\nBy striking down exclusivity and mandating syndication and data sharing, the court has handed rivals tools to erode Google's dominance at the edges, in places where consumer behavior is rapidly shifting toward AI-powered search.\nIn short, the good news ruling may prove to be a Trojan horse. Google remains profitable and dominant today, but the DOJ's remedies could sow the seeds of long-term disruption.\nGoogle's statement after the ruling hints at this. While insiders are cheering, the company suggested that it could appeal.\n\"The Court has imposed limits on how we distribute Google services, and will require us to share Search data with rivals,\" the company said. \"We have concerns about how these requirements will impact our users and their privacy, and we're reviewing the decision closely.\"\nSign up for BI's Tech Memo newsletter here.

      "text": "- Meta's EU policy manager, Christelle Dernon, announced internally that she was leaving the company.\n- Dernon seemed to make a jibe at Meta's performance reviews and said it \"Met Most\" of her expectations.\n- Another European policy leader left last month at a time when Meta faces extra regulatory challenges.\nA senior EU policy manager at Meta has announced that she's leaving the company \u2014 and gave it a \"Met Most\" rating in a seemingly tongue-in-cheek performance review posted on its internal forum.\nChristelle Dernon, a European public policy manager, said in a badge post on Meta's Workplace forum on Wednesday that she planned to leave on Friday. Dernon has worked as a public policy manager for campaigns and programs in Europe at Meta since 2021, according to her LinkedIn profile.\n\"Dear Meta, After four solid years, I've decided it's time for me to move on to a new exciting chapter. My last day is this Friday,\" Dernon wrote in the post, seen by Business Insider. \"So, time for a performance review. Your's not mine [wink emoji] Rating: Met Most Expectations* *caveat: they were sky-high.\"\nMeta has nine categories of ratings for its annual performance reviews, with \"Met Most Expectations\" being the fifth best, according to an internal document seen by BI. In January, Meta's chief, Mark Zuckerberg, announced the company would be acting quicker to get rid of \"low performers.\"\nDernon said in the post that she worked on the campaign for the EU's Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act and helped coordinate Meta's open letter on AI regulation that was signed by more than 40 CEOs.\nMeta declined to comment. Dernon couldn't immediately be reached for comment.\nDernon's departure comes just a month after Meta's director of public policy campaigns in Europe, Monica Allen, announced she was leaving the company, according to a post Allen shared on LinkedIn.\n\"What's next? First, basking in late summer lightness and time-richness with Mr Monica and the kiddo, who is robust enough for adventure and young enough to still want to spend a lot of time with his mama,\" Allen wrote.\nAllen, who had earlier been a special advisor to the former Meta president of global affairs Nick Clegg when he was serving as the UK's deputy prime minister, joined Meta in 2022. She led the direction of \"high priority\" policy campaigns, some of which relate to generative AI, the metaverse, and youth safety and well-being, according to her LinkedIn profile.\nThe two departures from Meta's EU public policy team come at a time when it faces heightened regulatory pressure.\nMeta's chief global affairs officer, Joel Kaplan, said in a July LinkedIn post that Europe was \"heading down the wrong path on AI\" and that Meta would not be signing the European Union's code of practice, a voluntary framework to comply with the Artificial Intelligence Act, which came into effect last year.\nKaplan said the act was an \"over-reach\" and would hurt frontier AI model deployment and development in Europe. The code of practice's requirements include providing regular updates and information about companies' tools. Developers are also barred from training AI on pirated content.\nMeta also said in July that, starting in October, it would stop accepting paid political, electoral, and social-issue advertising across the EU. The decision came in response to the incoming Transparency and Targeting of Political Advertising regulation, which comes with requirements that Meta described as \"unworkable.\"\nRead the full memo shared by Dernon. BI has redacted the names of other employees:\nDear Meta, After four solid years, I've decided it's time for me to move on to a new exciting chapter. My last day is this Friday. So, time for a performance review. Your's not mine [wink emoji]. Rating: Met Most Expectations* *caveat: they were sky-high You were my dream employer. I believed in you long before I joined \u2014 back when the Obama election, the Arab Spring and Safety Check made it feel like Facebook was helping rewrite what social connection meant in the 21st Century. I defended you (fiercely) through Cambridge Analytica. I turned down a promotion to work here. I came in all-in, with heart, intellect, and purpose. And to your credit, you delivered on lots of what I imagined. I was thrown in at the deep end right away, tackling a multi-pronged campaign sprint on DSA, DMA and data flows. I led bold campaigns on innovation across Europe, coordinated an open letter on AI regulation signed by over 40 CEOs, deployed red-teaming events for policy leaders, and helped shape the AI conversation at a pivotal time. Most importantly, I got to learn from brilliant, funny, resourceful people \u2014 the kind who challenge you, help you grow, and somehow make even the wildest weeks survivable. I can't possibly name everyone but want to extend heartfelt thanks to: - Europe Public Policy rockstars, especially my campaign partners in crime [names have been redacted to protect their privacy] for the laughter and team spirit, come hell or high water.\n- The core EU AI campaign crew \u2014 [redacted names] - - forever bonded by the joy (and traumas) of the open letter(s) and sprint-marathons.\n- Global XFN partners and friends for their collaboration over the years: [redacted names]\n- My Paris office support system, in particular the wonderful [redacted names], and so many others.\nAnd finally, leadership \u2014 thanks to [redacted names] for the opportunities, and to Laurent for his guidance and encouragement throughout my time here. And for the next half? Keep leaning into what makes you great: you're filled with extraordinary talent. Keep empowering people to be bold, direct, imaginative, and true to the values that inspired so many of us to join in the first place. As for me, I'm glad I came. I leave clearer, stronger, and with a renewed sense of the kind of leader I want to be \u2014 one who builds with intention, protects what makes people shine, and stays allergic to bullsh*t.\nFor my own next half (that word struck out) year, I'll be exploring entrepreneurial paths and beautiful places \u2014 more to come soon on LinkedIn + behind the scenes on IG.Thanks for the lessons.

      "text": "- I spent Labor Day weekend in the Hamptons.\n- Some aspects of the favored Wall Street beach spot matched my expectations, but others surprised me.\n- Local tensions about wealth and trends in the nightlife stuck out.\nI'd been driving for almost three hours when I saw the license plate signalling my time in the car was almost over: an abbreviated spelling of Water Mill, a hamlet in Southampton.\nI spent the notoriously busy Labor Day weekend in the Hamptons, and though I knew to expect a wide variety of wellness options and expensive groceries, other aspects of the East End stood out.\nTension simmers not so far under the surface\nThe Hamptons is well-known for a tremendous concentration of wealth, but not everyone visiting over the weekend supported the uber-rich.\nOn Sunday, a small group of protesters gathered in East Hampton as part of a nationwide \"Workers Over Billionaires\" campaign. Some gathered at an iconic restaurant; others targeted the home of the billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. A press release for the event said protesters wanted to \"confront billionaire donors reshaping New York politics,\" referencing the city's coming mayoral race, with the policies of the frontrunner Zohran Mamdani having spooked some wealthy residents.\nHouses were also a source of conflict. Two luxury real estate agents in the area told Business Insider that some residents were grumbling about a recent change to the East Hampton zoning code that limits the size of new houses. Local news talked about existing properties, though \u2014 an edition of the East Hampton Star featured an article about water usage in the area, noting that some homes pump millions of gallons of water yearly.\nIt's more family-oriented than expected\nMany know about the Hamptons nightlife, but I was struck by how family-oriented the area seemed, even on such a busy weekend. I saw more kids with ice cream cones than I did drunken clubbers, at least out in public. Kyle Rosko, a real estate agent at Douglas Elliman, told me most of his buyers are families.\nThat's not to say there wasn't drinking or partying \u2014 lines at the infamous Stephen Talkhouse, for example, stretched down the block.\nRemote work changed things\nI knew crowds would swell over Labor Day, but I saw firsthand how stark the difference is between midweek and the weekend. The Hampton Classic Horse Show was fairly empty when I visited on Wednesday, but an employee at a food stall told me crowds surge on the weekend.\nIn Montauk, lines stretched out the door at local coffee and breakfast spots over the weekend, but I didn't see any crowds when driving through on Tuesday morning. The same went for Amber Waves, one of Ina Garten's favorite farm stands \u2014 there was hardly a wait on Wednesday, though customers snaked through the aisles late Sunday morning. I wasn't shocked, but the difference was more striking than I expected.\nDana Feller, 52, a cofounder of the homeware brand Hamptons Blue who lives in Water Mill full time, said she'd seen remote work affect the pacing of each week.\n\"A lot of people come out here now on Thursday and then stay some time through Monday, and then they're in the office Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,\" said Feller, who has been coming to the Hamptons for 20 years but moved here permanently during the pandemic. \"As opposed to it being a Friday to Sunday, it's now a Thursday to Monday.\"\nBy the time I left on September 2, the summer season had officially ended. One waitress at a popular Amagansett spot told me she would head to Colorado to work for the winter ski season; a valet at a Montauk restaurant said they were getting ready to shut down until next year.\nThe natural beauty isn't all natural\nAs picturesque as many of the multimillion-dollar houses are, the landscaping sometimes caught my eye more than the architecture. Hedges are cut at right angles or in perfect bulbs; hydrangea bushes are trimmed to reveal perfect end-of-summer blooms.\nNature is far more unruly, though, than the estates suggest, and evidence of the work required to maintain the landscape is everywhere. Vanity Fair reported in 2023 that some residents spend hundreds of thousands annually to maintain their lawns.\nOne morning, I heard two employees from a groundskeeping business talking in front of a house in Amagansett about \"fixing\" the landscaping chaos (to my untrained eye, the lawn looked pretty good). Landscaping trucks dot the shoulders of local roads, and it's easy to notice them given how slowly traffic often crawls."

In it, Leno asked how often people use the driver-assistance software.\n\"You know, it's increasing a lot, like the take rate has gone up from single-digit percentages on all our cars to we're in the teens now,\" Moravy answered. \"On S and X, it's over 50, 60%. And we have a lot of people that use it in these cars like on every drive, you know, you can get addicted to it really quick.\"\nTesla released FSD in beta in the US in 2020 and to paying customers across North America two years later.\nFSD can follow your navigation route, change lanes, and make turns, although it has drawn scrutiny and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigations over some accidents, some of which were fatal. FSD still requires active supervision by a human driver at the wheel.\nNew and existing Model S, Model 3, Model X, Model Y, and Cybertruck owners get a 30-day trial of FSD.\nTesla has changed the price of FSD significantly over the years. In 2022, it rose in cost from $10,000 to $12,000 and then to $15,000. Most recently, the price was reduced from $12,000 to $8,000 in 2024. It costs $99 a month on a subscription basis."

      "text": "- Jeffrey Epstein accusers are considering making their own \"Epstein list\" amid government inaction.\n- Accuser Lisa Phillips said she won't make it public, but lawyers say victims will help prosecutors.\n- Victims are pushing for a bill that would reveal financial details about Epstein's sex trafficking.\nWhile there's no evidence that Jeffrey Epstein's \"client list\" exists, one of his accusers said that survivors may create a list of their own.\nAt a pair of events in solidarity with Epstein's sexual abuse victims, accuser Lisa Phillips said the victims were considering taking matters into their own hands.\n\"We know the names. Many of us were abused by them,\" Phillips said at a rally organized by World Without Exploitation, an organization that fights human trafficking.\n\"Now, together as survivors, we will confidentially compile the names we all know were regularly in the Epstein world,\" she continued. \"And it will be done by survivors and for survivors. No one else is involved.\"\nThe two events \u2014 one organized by World Without Exploitation, another by several members of Congress \u2014 were hosted Wednesday morning in Washington, DC.\nEach featured speeches from Epstein accusers and their family members, with some sharing their accusations in public for the first time. Three members of Congress urged their colleagues to vote for legislation that would force the federal government to make its files about Epstein public.\nLauren Hersh, the national director of World Without Exploitation, said that Epstein accusers wanted to seize a moment where the public demands answers about how the government treated the well-connected sex trafficker.\nPhillips's idea for accusers to create their own list of people affiliated with Epstein demonstrated that \"survivors are done with waiting for other people to do what they are able to do,\" Hersh told Business Insider.\n\"When we rely on systems to take care of things, sometimes that takes a very long time, and sometimes that means it doesn't get done,\" Hersh said. \"And what they're saying is, 'This needs to happen, it needs to happen urgently, and if it's not going to successfully happen within systems, we're going to do it ourselves.'\"\n'Why do we have to say the names when the government knows the names?'\nEarlier this year, the Trump administration backtracked on earlier commitments to publish government documents about Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 of trafficking girls to Epstein for sex.\nEpstein was permitted to plead guilty in 2008 to minor prostitution solicitation charges in Florida, even though law enforcement officers collected evidence that the well-connected pedophile had sexually abused dozens of girls. In 2019, he killed himself in his Manhattan jail cell while awaiting trial for more severe sex-trafficking charges.\nOver the summer, Maxwell was moved to a more lax prison to serve the remainder of her 20-year sentence after giving an interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. In recordings of the interview published by the Justice Department, Maxwell, who is appealing her conviction, said she wasn't aware of any sexual abuse.\nGiving \"airtime\" to Maxwell was \"repulsive,\" said Teresa Helms, another one of Epstein's victims, who spoke at the second Wednesday rally.\n\"Her voice was elevated way before our voices were elevated here today,\" Helms said.\nAt the second event, Wednesday morning, when asked if she would make the accuser-compiled list public, Phillips said it was the obligation of the federal government, not accusers, to hold people accountable.\n\"Why do we have to say the names when the government knows the names?\" she said. \"And we're also scared to do so. Look what's happened to so many of the survivors that have revealed names.\"\nBrad Edwards, an attorney who's represented over 100 accusers, said victims were scarred from the Justice Department's failures to properly prosecute Epstein.\n\"The victims are very scared to say these names because they could get sued,\" Edwards said. \"They're going to get attacked. And nobody protected him the first time \u2014 and that was against one person.\"\nBrittany Henderson, another attorney representing Epstein victims, said accusers would assist in additional criminal investigations.\n\"If someone's interested in prosecuting, they may have something different to say about sharing a list,\" Henderson said. \"But they're not sharing a list for nothing to happen. And that's the experience that they've had for all of these years.\"\nThe bill would force the release of more Epstein files\nThe House Oversight Committee has said it would publish government records about Epstein.\nSo far, it has not gone smoothly.\nOn Tuesday night, the committee published what it described as 33,295 pages provided by the Justice Department. Nearly all of them were already public.\nThe newly released records appear to include records from flights Epstein took in the 2010s, although they include numerous redactions.\nAccording to The New York Post, they also include a minute of video that had been missing from previously released security footage outside the hallway near Epstein's Manhattan jail cell on the night he died. The footage shows nothing happening.\nThe discharge petition promoted by Reps. Ro Khanna, Thomas Massie, and Marjorie Taylor Greene would force the Justice Department, as well as other federal agencies, to publish their records while making redactions for private victim information.\nEdwards said Wednesday that the legislation would allow the public to see bank records involving JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank, which he said were kept secret because of protective orders, confidentiality agreements, and bank secrecy laws. Both financial institutions settled lawsuits brought by Edwards on behalf of Epstein victims without admitting to wrongdoing.\nMarina Laserta said at one of the rallies that Epstein had abused her for three years, starting when she was 14 years old.\nWhile Laserta said she was identified as \"Victim-1\" in Epstein's 2019 indictment, Wednesday marked the first time she had spoken publicly.\nThe legislation, if passed by Congress, would allow her to understand what happened to her, she said.\n\"If the government is going to release his documents to the public, describing the crimes committed by Jeffrey Epstein and others, the least they can do is give me my documents that they have about me,\" she said."

      "text": "- Instagram finally made an iPad app.\n- It opens directly onto Reels, which suggests Meta knows you just want to watch videos on there.\n- Finally, a way to brain-rot myself completely on my couch.\nAt long last, the white whale of iOS has been harpooned: Instagram finally made an app for iPad.\nShockingly, there had never been a true iPad Instagram app \u2014 you could download the regular Instagram mobile app and use it on an iPad, but it was a uniquely crummy experience \u2014 you could use it with a phone-sized display or zoomed out, and the whole thing was clunky and sad.\nFinally, there's a new iPad version, nearly 15 years after Instagram first launched. (The iPad, also launched in 2010, just barely predates Instagram.)\nI tried it out on my iPad (which, honestly, I don't use all that much other than occasionally for scrolling on the couch when I leave my phone in the other room), and I have to say: This is the Cadillac of doomscrolling.\nThe biggest difference the iPad app has from the phone version is that it always opens onto the Reels tab. No more pretense that you might be hoping to see \"photos\" from your \"friends\" in the main feed.\nInstead, you'll see Stories at the top, should you choose to interact with those plebes you know in real life who cling to the sad concept of posting photos and videos from their real life to share with their close friends.\nWhat I like best about the experience is that the sound on the first video you see is off by default. But instead of having to tap the \ud83d\udd0a icon in the corner of the frame, you simply scroll down slightly, and the sound starts playing. This saves you the highly unpleasant experience of opening an app and having sound start playing right away, and it's also more intuitive to just slightly scroll down than to hunt and tap for a sound on/off icon. Great!\nWhat does it mean that Instagram's iPad app is so Reels-centric? A more video-first approach makes sense with Reels and iPads. Since iPads are popular for watching video content \u2014 YouTube or Netflix \u2014 why not sit back and watch some Reels?\nInstagram's official blog post says: \"With Instagram for iPad, we've redesigned the experience to reflect how people use bigger screens today \u2014 for lean back entertainment.\"\nBuddy, you don't have to tell me twice to lean back and stare at a screen until I feel numb inside! Thanks, Meta!"

EV startups Nio, Leapmotor, and Xpeng all reported record monthly sales in August, while giant auto conglomerate Geely saw its sales surge 38% last month to nearly 150,000 vehicles.\nChina's EV market is famously competitive, with over 100 companies battling for customers.\nLocal brands have launched a wave of new affordable electric SUVs in recent months, many of which are directly targeting Tesla's best-selling Model Y.\nXpeng launched the $27,320 G7 SUV in July, with Nio quickly following with the $36,940 L90 six-seater. Both are priced below the Model Y and have seen strong demand, but they are dwarfed by Xiaomi's YU7, which received more than 240,000 preorders in 24 hours when it launched in June.\nSmartphone maker Xiaomi, which only launched its first electric car last year, sold over 30,000 cars in August as it races to ramp up production to meet intense demand.\nWaiting times for the YU7 have been advertised as more than a year, and CEO Lei Jun even recently suggested that customers should consider buying a Tesla instead if they would rather not wait.\nTesla's sales in China have been hurt by its stale product lineup, and the company recently unveiled an extended six-seater version of the Model Y as it looks to fight off fierce local competition.\nOn the bright side for Tesla, it is not the only company facing pressure from the growing popularity of China's EV startups. BYD, which is on track to overtake Tesla as the world's top seller of EVs this year, also reported flat sales in August."

      "text": "- Memories.ai says it's offering $2 million packages to lure top AI talent after raising $8 million.\n- Its CEO, Shawn Shen, a former Meta AI research scientist, says the compensation is mostly equity.\n- Shen said Meta's reorganizations are pushing some people to leave. Meta declined to comment.\nShawn Shen is the 28-year-old cofounder and CEO of Memories.ai, a startup that builds AI to see and understand visual data. He got a Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge before joining Meta as a research scientist. Late last year, Shen left Meta to launch his startup, raising an $8 million seed round this summer backed by Samsung and others.\nMeta has supercharged the Silicon Valley talent wars by making staggering, nine-figure offers for some AI researchers and starting a new AI unit, Meta Superintelligence Labs. That's sparked tensions in its sprawling AI operations, with some Meta staff leaving.\nMemories.ai announced Thursday that it's offering up to $2 million compensation packages for researchers from Meta, Google, Microsoft, Anthropic, xAI, and others. It also recently hired Chi-Hao Wu, a former Meta research scientist, as its chief AI officer.\nThis is an as-told-to essay based on a conversation with Shen. It has been edited for length and clarity. Meta and Microsoft declined to comment. Google, OpenAI, xAI, and Anthropic didn't respond to requests for comment.\nWhy I'm offering AI researchers $2 million\nIt's because of the talent war that was started by Mark Zuckerberg. I used to work at Meta, and I speak with my former colleagues often about this. When I heard about their compensation packages, I was shocked \u2014 it's really in the tens of millions range. But it shows that in this age, AI researchers who make the best models and stand at the frontier of technology are really worth this amount of money.\nWe're building an AI model that can see and remember just like humans. The things that we are working on are very niche. So we are looking for people who are really, really good at the whole field of understanding video data.\nWe're not worried about running out of money\nWe are welcoming people who want to take more equity compared to cash, which means that it won't shrink our runway by a huge amount. The exact cash-versus-equity split will depend on the person we hire. We will treat these hires as founding members, not as employees. Anyways, equity is where you can get a hundred or even a thousand times return in the future.\nWe are thinking of hiring three to five people in the next 6 months, and another five to ten in the next 12 months. We plan to raise more money, too.\nSpending so much on talent will help, not hurt, our fundraising\nAs long as we have the ability to consistently attract top AI talent, raising additional capital will not be a problem. The capital markets are eager to back companies that can do this. Just look at how much Thinking Machines Labs has raised or how much Fei-Fei Li's startup has raised. As long as an AI company can recruit the best AI people, they can really just go through any kind of economic period.\nMeta's constant reorgs help our hiring efforts\nMeta is constantly doing reorganizations. Your manager and your goals can change every few months. For some researchers, it can be really frustrating and feel like a waste of time. So yes, I think that's a driver for people to leave Meta and join other companies, especially startups.\nThere's other reasons people might leave. I think the biggest one is what Mark (Zuckerberg) has said: in an age that's evolving so fast, the biggest risk is not taking any risks. So why not do that and potentially change the world as part of a trillion-dollar company?\nWe have already hired Eddy Wu, our Chief AI Officer who was my manager's manager at Meta. He's making a similar amount to what we're offering the new people. He was on their generative AI team, which is now Meta Superintelligence Labs. And we are already talking to a few other people from MSL and some others from Google DeepMind.\nI learned a lot of great things from Meta\nI definitely learned a lot from Meta because Meta is very bottom-up. So you see a lot of innovations across different departments. Things like multimodal, visual, and super-personalized AI \u2014 everyone is so open to talking about their ideas. I met with so many talented people. I made an effort to meet three to four of them every week to talk about our hobbies and future goals.\nIt really shaped my future and gave me a clear road map. But in the end, the reason I left Meta is that I wanted to start a great company."

      "text": "Being a college freshman has never been smooth sailing. Weird roommates, demanding professors, and unseasoned dining hall food are all standard fare in the bewildering transition to young adulthood. But has there ever been a more uneasy time to commit to a degree than right now?\nThe class of 2029 is on edge. Today's 18-year-olds spent middle school locked down in a pandemic. They've grown up more online and socially isolated than past generations, and in the Healthy Minds Study, a survey conducted by a consortium of universities, more than 30% of students report feeling depressed and/or anxious. The campuses they've just arrived at are entrenched in a culture war, as the Trump administration has cut research budgets or pulled funding to enforce restrictions on student protests and free speech. International students face added obstacles to getting visas, and their numbers may plummet this fall. Tuition and fees at some colleges, meanwhile, have begun to surpass $100,000 a year. The average Gen Zer is carrying $23,000 in student debt, Experian found.\nAs for the dream jobs these colleges are preparing them for, many are wondering how much longer they'll even exist, as companies look to embrace generative AI. And what, exactly, should they be doing with AI themselves? The most native GenAI users yet have been caught between admonishments that the world will leave them behind if they don't master the ability to prompt ChatGPT and the risk of getting caught cheating on their assignments if they rely on the chatbot.\nNo wonder young Americans are increasingly skeptical that college is worth the time and money.\nAmid all this uncertainty, colleges themselves are feeling their way through their own identity crises. The US college system is far from perfect today. It can be inefficient and full of bloated costs. Schools must balance appealing to employers by giving students workplace-ready hard skills while also providing chances for young people to stumble and become autonomous and resilient critical thinkers and collaborators. Those soft skills are the type that correlate to higher career success, especially as AI assumes more entry-level tasks.\n\"We have to revolutionize and reimagine higher education in ways that connect curriculum to career,\" says Lynn Pasquerella, the president of the Association of American Colleges and Universities. That means making students more \"adaptable and flexible\" to rapid change, she says, but colleges must be better incorporating internships or programs that connect students to their local communities to gain work experience and that real-world perspective. \"At the same time, we have to take into account the fact that increasingly, students want more than just getting a job. They want lives of meaning and purpose.\"\nThe idyllic college campus steeped in tradition is changing. Like many students, it just doesn't know what it wants to be yet.\nYoung people are inundated with messages that the value of a college degree is drying up and that lucrative alternatives abound. Palantir is offering fellowships to high schoolers who want to \"skip the indoctrination\" of college, and Silicon Valley still loves the young founder who leaves the dorm in the dust. Gen Z values both autonomy and wealth, and there are legions of young TikTok and Instagram influencers showcasing how to achieve both without a degree \u2014 as Airbnb hosts, realtors, drop shippers, video game streamers, plumbers, OnlyFans influencers, and sales course gurus. Sam Altman, himself a Stanford dropout, said on a podcast in July that college was \"not working great for most people\" but that \"if you fast-forward 18 years, it's going to look like a very, very different thing,\" as AI changes the demands of the education system. A new study from the Stanford Digital Economy Lab found that since AI adoption became commonplace, employment rates among workers ages 22 to 25 dropped a relative 13% in roles highly exposed to AI, like software development and customer service.\nA degree remains the most tried and true way to build wealth over time.\nWhile the perks of earning a degree may feel elusive to some recent grads and students, a degree remains the most tried and true way to build wealth over time. \"The level of uncertainty and risk is as high as it's ever been when it comes to understanding what the value proposition of pursuing a degree is,\" says Zack Mabel, the director of research at the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. \"What matters is, what's a young person's fallback option if they don't go to college?\"\nGen Z college graduates in 2024 brought home a median salary of $60,000, based on data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, while high school graduates made $40,000. Over the course of their careers, men and women with bachelor's degrees earn a median $900,000 and $630,000, respectively, more than their counterparts who graduate from high school, according to the Social Security Administration. And white-collar bosses still want to hire college-educated workers. \"We've not seen an erosion from employers who suddenly can do without a four-year degree,\" says Kevin Kruger, the president and CEO of FirstGen Forward, an organization focused on helping first-generation college students.\nAI, meanwhile, also isn't the college-killer some feared it to be when ChatGPT swept through campuses three years ago. \"I don't think higher ed loses its value, but I do think it has to adapt to technology very rapidly,\" says Safinah Ali, a professor of educational communication at New York University's Steinhardt School. She sees meaningful uses for AI being taught across disciplines \u2014 not just in technical subjects like computer science, but in the humanities and arts. The younger students are, Ali says, the better they tend to be at embracing changes and new tools without worrying about how different the world will look in four years. Even Altman thinks younger workers will be just fine \u2014 it's the older workers without a willingness to adapt that he fears will be hurt. \"A lot is going to happen in six months to 12 months, so the notion of trying to predict exactly where we'll be in four years is nearly impossible,\" says Christine Cruzvergara, the chief education strategy officer at the early career site Handshake. That sounds scary to the seasoned worker, but for a college freshman, a year can feel like a lifetime. \"There's probably also an element of optimism, because they're just starting and they have four years ahead of them.\"\nNot unlike young adults who enrolled in college at the outset of the Great Recession, today's freshmen may be sheltered from the worst of the AI storm. \"We're in the disruption phase at the moment,\" Cruzvergara says. \"My guess would be in four years, we will have gotten out of some of that disruption phase, and we will be more in the calibration phase.\" And as businesses calibrate, students have the relative freedom to experiment.\nAt the same time, if a college goes too all in on AI, it risks not preparing students with the critical thinking and soft skills also necessary for successful careers. Recent research from MIT suggests that relying too heavily on ChatGPT can make people lazy and dependent on the tech. In the study, those who used ChatGPT to help write essays \"consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels\" compared with control groups. The Atlantic reported last year that students were arriving at elite colleges and struggling to read and parse novels. \"Even for well-intentioned students, who don't want to cheat, it is impacting their ability to think and grow,\" says Annie Chechitelli, the chief product officer at Turnitin, which offers plagiarism and AI detection software. Because AI is changing so rapidly, she thinks colleges should focus more on developing broad-ranging soft skills rather than hyperfocusing on specific AI tools in a field. \"We're going to get back to generalists, because things are changing too quickly,\" Chechitelli says. \"If you're not a mental athlete, you're not going to be able to adjust.\"\nIf words are no longer a reflection of learning, you're going to have to assess learning differently.Jenny Maxwell, head of education at Grammarly\nSome professors are opting to shun GenAI entirely and have students complete more tests and essay assignments in class, but there's a growing consensus that old-school assessments should be left in the past. In August, Grammarly released eight AI agents built on OpenAI and other large language models. The agents can take on tasks like evaluating a drafted essay against an assignment rubric, giving students suggestions for how to improve the paper and assigning a predictive grade.\nGenerative AI has upended traditional essay assignments, and that calls for changing how students are tested and graded. \"If words are no longer a reflection of learning, you're going to have to assess learning differently,\" says Jenny Maxwell, the head of education at Grammarly. She sees the company's agents not as just ways to level the playing field in the five-paragraph essay, but as evidence that the way students are evaluated needs to change. It's less now about catching cheaters and more about finding new ways to show mastery of concepts. \"What I'm actually hoping happens is the essay game is no longer the essay game,\" Maxwell says. Maybe, she says, AI can push students to think deeper about concepts, so there's less expectation to regurgitate what they're taught in a standardized essay.\nProfessors are still figuring out the best ways to evaluate students while they use AI, and there's no consensus yet. Dennis Yi Tenen, a professor of English at Columbia University, is teaching a course called Writing AI this fall, focused on the ways AI tools are reshaping the writing process and their limitations to do so, and he says it quickly filled up with about 80 eager students who think there will be big returns on mastering AI. Teaching AI as a writing partner has already reshaped how he interacts with his students, he says. \"Rather than performing expertise and lecturing, I'm much more brutally honest,\" Yi Tenen says, explaining that he's become more candid about what we know and don't know about how AI works best. \"With a class on AI where stuff is so open-ended right now, nobody knows that answer. Let's experiment with this.\"\nWith colleges and professors still figuring out how to navigate AI and the cultural backlash to higher ed, there's room to reevaluate how students are assessed. Highly driven perfectionists arrive on campus with a history of straight A's and an avoidance of failure, and the hefty weight of tuition can discourage risk-taking \u2014 yet that's exactly what the protective bubble of a college experience should provide. \"We're not born with a specific set of talents, and we learn from failure,\" Pasquerella says. \"But you have to have a curriculum that allows people to learn from failure and not kick them out if they fail their first few assignments.\"\nOutside of the financial perks, college is a sandbox in which young people take baby steps to adulting. Part of the disconnect in the value of college comes from what young people actually get from four years spent eating processed foods and pledging sororities or fraternities. If you try to play a numbers game and break down the cost, plus interest, add the four years of your time, and then weigh that as an exact exchange for a specific job or salary, that misses some of the less tangible benefits. Colleges have to sell a bigger idea with their high ticket price. \"You need to make the value proposition more attractive in the immediacy for students to be willing to make the investment, because it looks so scary initially,\" Mabel says. \"These are people that haven't lived much of their life, and they're hungry to have a crack at having some money in their pocket and being able to live their life as they want to.\"\nConvincing some that the time and money invested in a degree won't be wasted is becoming a harder conversation for colleges in a world loudly criticizing higher ed. But coursework and campus life teach young people resilience and collaboration and expose them to new ideas and people. They spend those years learning to problem-solve, and the growth is about much more than the dozen or so hours a week spent in class. It's not the kind of skill or lesson that AI can undermine. The appeal of college isn't dead; it's just stuck in an awkward phase.\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

      "text": "A market correction. A wake-up call. A great digestion. Call it what you want: AI is going through it.\nTwo things appear to be happening in tandem. Businesses are starting to finally grasp what AI can \u2014 and importantly, can't \u2014 do to boost their bottom lines. And the sky-high expectations that have been partly inflated and overhyped by AI firms over the past few years are finally coming down to Earth.\nIn short, it's increasingly looking like both the AI doomers and boomers were both wrong. AI's trajectory is starting to look less like a time machine or space elevator and more akin computers, smartphones, televisions: The technology will get better, it will almost certainly change our lives in the fullness of time, but it will more likely do so incrementally \u2014 to the point that if AGI (artificial general intelligence) or superintelligence do in fact one day arrive, it might not seem like much of a leap at all.\nThere's perhaps no better example of this happening than OpenAI's latest and long-anticipated model, GPT-5, which was touted with a bang and landed with a shrug. Ahead of launch, OpenAI's Sam Altman said he'd felt \"useless\" compared to the model's intelligence, even drawing parallels with the Manhattan Project. When it arrived, users apparently felt less intimidated. \"The degree of overhyping was too significant,\" one person wrote. \"In the absence of massive gains, all you have is hype,\" wrote another.\nBut it may be a glimpse at our new reality, where the breakneck speed of AI progress is simply steadying, where progress cannot run on hype alone, and where we will neither experience an overnight white-collar job wipeout nor reach an AI abundance society overnight.\nWelcome to AI's \"meh\" era. Stay calm. We've been here before. It'll all be fine. Probably.\nWhen the internet revolution took hold in the late 1990s, companies were minting millions overnight with little more than a website and a savvy sales pitch. By the year 2000, the economic reality caught up to the hype, leaving trillions of dollars wiped out overnight. Not familiar? Go ask your parents what happened to Pets.com.\nIt's easy to see why talk of a bubble has once again reared its head. Even Altman recently (and in an unusually measured moment from AI's biggest hype man) said he believes the AI market might be in a bubble.\nProgress has been such that you probably won't even notice the improvements from now on.Carl Benedikt Frey\n\"If you go back to the 1990s when the dotcom bubble burst, there weren't the profits necessarily to back the investments up, but there were tangible productivity gains,\" says Carl Benedikt Frey, an economist at Oxford. If that sounds eerily familiar, a check on AI now could prevent history from repeating itself.\nA recent study published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology further stirred the pot last month, claiming that just 5% of companies it studied have managed to convert the technology into actual revenue \u2014 a revelation scary enough to cause a tech stock sell-off, even if the study had a lot of limitations.\nOther evidence suggests AI is starting to have an impact on businesses that are adopting it. A study from Stanford University researchers that analyzed payroll data concluded that AI was killing off entry-level jobs for people aged 22 to 25, and was especially doing so in fields where AI was more likely to replace, rather than augment, labor. Marc Benioff claims AI agents are replacing thousands of Salesforce's support roles, while other companies are boasting about AI automating more of their work.\nA study of AI's effects on the demand for foreign translators by Frey and fellow Oxford economist Pedro Llanos-Paredes, published earlier this year, concluded that the technology was having a small but provable impact on these jobs.\n\"We seem to be seeing reasonable revenue growth for a handful of firms that are pioneering the AI revolution, but we're not seeing it translate into broader economic growth,\" Frey tells me. \"What I find concerning is that we're still not seeing any hint of it in the productivity statistics, and ultimately that's what matters. It doesn't really matter how well AI performs on tests or on some benchmark. What matters is translating that into real economic growth.\"\nFor the markets, a more modest uptake may be perfectly OK. Evercore ISI strategists predict AI excitement will buoy US stocks a further 20% by the end of 2026. \"AI is 'bigger' than the internet,\" they wrote in a note published this week. \"In three years, its effect has touched all parts of society and industry even as adoption only begins to inflect.\"\nLast week's Nvidia earnings were a strong indicator of where we're at. The company, which sells the valuable chips on which AI is trained and run, has become something of a bellwether for the entire artificial intelligence boom and counts some of the biggest tech giants as key customers. (Bloomberg estimates that Microsoft spends about 47% of its capital expenditures on Nvidia's chips.) While it beat Wall Street expectations and its own sales records, its stock still dropped, suggesting investors weren't impressed with the figures they saw. Some analysts warn that the companies buying these services from Nvidia aren't yet seeing the returns. One UBS analyst characterized Nvidia's results in a way that may perfectly sum up the new steady-chug-along paradigm of AI: \"good enough.\"\nAll to say, AI seems to have reached its iPhone 4 moment.\nWhen Apple's iPhone 4 arrived in 2010, it was nothing short of a smash hit. Onstage in Cupertino, Steve Jobs boasted that Apple had made the thinnest phone in the world with a laundry list of new must-have features: a squared-off design, high-resolution display, a front-facing camera for FaceTime and selfies, and the debut of Apple's custom silicon chip, the A4. It flew off the shelves \u2014 despite the antenna fiasco \u2014 and further cemented Apple as the king of the smartphone. One could argue that the market has been chasing the iPhone 4's \"sandwich glass\" design ever since.\nA lot of this sort of feeling of disappointment is due to unreasonable levels of hype.David Krueger\nThen things changed: With the exception of a couple of moderate leaps since, the iPhone has been on a more incremental trajectory. Evidence suggests artificial intelligence might be plotting a similar course. Frontier labs have been rolling out a steady flow of updates and mini-leaps, rather than waiting years between generations, and as a result, each new rollout has started feeling evolutionary, incremental.\n\"If you're not the leading expert in the field, I think the progress has been such that you probably won't even notice the improvements from now on,\" says Frey.\nLast year, the big topic was whether AI labs were seeing diminishing returns when simply trying to throw more data and compute power at the models. That may go some way to explain how GPT-5 landed, but it's not the only factor.\nBetween the launch of GPT-4 in March 2023 and GPT-5 last month, OpenAI rolled out well over a dozen models, each one focusing on specific jobs or incrementally improving another. It's perhaps no wonder, then, that GPT-5 didn't blow our socks off. (In the same conversation in which Altman claimed AI is in a bubble, he also claimed that OpenAI has more advanced models than GPT-5, but can't deploy them because it doesn't have the capacity.)\nGoogle's latest frontier model, Gemini 2.5, is also a bridge model, and the launch of GPT-5 may serve as a healthy warning to temper expectations for Gemini 3, which is expected before the year's end.\n\"The progress just feels more continuous,\" says David Krueger, an assistant professor at the University of Montreal who studies AI safety and risks.\nKrueger still thinks we'll have the occasional \"wow\" moment, but said he also believes we'll need more breakthroughs on the technical side to reach any level of artificial intelligence that can go toe-to-toe with a human \u2014 and he says he doesn't believe we will reach AGI from large language models alone.\n\"I think LLMs and more broadly deep learning are probably a big piece of the puzzle. If I had to bet, the biggest one,\" he says. \"But I think we're maybe missing a couple of puzzle pieces.\"\nKrueger also lays blame at the feet of certain AI figureheads who have created \"unreasonable levels of hype,\" and who are finally getting a reality check. Altman may be the worst offender, but he's not the only one.\nIn March, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicted that AI would be writing 90% of software developers' code in three to six months. The actual gains appear to be much more modest: During Alphabet's Q1 2025 earnings call, CEO Sundar Pichai said that more than 30% of code written at Google was being generated by AI.\n\"I think a lot of this sort of feeling of disappointment is due to unreasonable levels of hype from the companies,\" said Krueger. As the rubber hits the road and the breakneck speed of AI potentially slows, expectations for the future of AI \u2014 and the possible, maybe, one day, arrival of AGI \u2014 are finally being put in check.\nYou can see how we got here. In a January interview with Bloomberg, Altman predicted AGI would arrive during Trump's second presidency. Elon Musk once predicted it could be here by the year's end. According to some of the best minds in AI, AGI is often just a \"few years away.\" In truth it feels like we're finally realizing nobody actually knows.\nPerhaps nobody has had more of a humbling in AI than Apple, which earlier this year axed an iPhone 16 ad that promised several much-hyped new AI features that, as it turned out, were far from ready. When Tim Cook steps onstage next week, don't be surprised if he and other executives strike a more measured tone when talking about AI, as they pull back the curtain on the latest lineup of devices.\nI hear the new phone will be a little thinner this time.\nHugh Langley is a senior correspondent at Business Insider where he writes about Google, tech, and wealth.\nBusiness Insider's Discourse stories provide perspectives on the day's most pressing issues, informed by analysis, reporting, and expertise."

One section of the survey focused on the ways they're using AI tools.\nIt reveals interns' habits and thoughts around the platforms, including exactly how often they're using it \u2014 the number of interns using AI on a daily basis doubled over last year, for example. It reports which chatbot is most popular among interns (yes, there's one clear winner), along with what they use it for most and what tasks they think it's most helpful for.\nInterns also said what they're most skeptical about, and voted on how worried they are about it taking over finance jobs.\nThis is the seventh year that the bank's equity research team has tracked its summer interns' perspectives and the third year it has asked them about AI. Most of the respondents \u2014 about 70% \u2014 were 21 years old or younger, and, the report said, represent the \"next generation of innovators, disrupters, and decision-makers who will define the future of industry.\"\nHere's how these Wall Street interns are using and thinking about AI right now.\nInterns are using AI a lot\nAbout 96% of Morgan Stanley's survey respondents said they use some kind of AI tool at least occasionally, which is up from 75% two years ago. When asked exactly how often interns use AI tools, most said either daily (35%) or several times a week (42%).\nChatGPT is their favorite tool by far \u2014 72% of Morgan Stanley's interns said they use it daily or several times a week, far outpacing similar chats like Claude, Gemini, and Copilot.\nMost have paid AI subscriptions\nMore than half of the Morgan Stanley interns (52%) reported personally subscribing to the paid version of an AI tool. About 48% said they have paid for ChatGPT, reiterating the tool's popularity.\nThey use AI for work tasks \u2014 but also in their personal lives\nIn one part of the survey, interns were asked how and what they use ChatGPT for. The most common uses were work-related. About 79% of interns said they use it to learn about a new topic and summarize long pieces of text. The other most common usages of the tool are drafting/editing emails or other texts (74%) and writing, programming, or debugging code (56%).\nMany interns also use ChatGPT for personal tasks: About 45% said they ask it for personal advice and help planning a vacation. About 36% use it to find recipes and 34% ask it for medical information. Just under 20% use it to compare prices and shop for products.\nMany are worried about AI taking finance jobs\nAbout 58% of Morgan Stanley interns reported feeling either somewhat concerned (41%) or very concerned (17%) that AI could replace jobs on Wall Street.\nMost only expect their own utilization of the tools to go up from here. About 78% said they expect their usage of AI tools and platforms to increase, either significantly (39%) or slightly (39%).\nThey think AI saves time\nMost interns completely agreed that AI saves them time (69%), is easy to use (63%), and is useful in daily life (54%). Notably, about 46% completely agreed that it has reduced their use of browser search bars.\nThey're concerned about what AI produces\nDespite their high usage of AI and agreement that it's useful, a lot of the interns (48%) said they are very concerned about the misinformation and accuracy in AI. Another 39% said they are somewhat concerned about it.\nTheir second highest concern is the way AI may use their personal data and information \u2014 35% are very concerned about this, and 34% are somewhat concerned."

      "text": "- Goldman Sachs says the market is headed into a new \"postmodern\" cycle.\n- The firm says it's the fourth so-called super cycle since World War II.\n- Goldman highlighted three investment ideas for investors to play the new regime.\nIf you're stuck in the weeds of the stock market every day, it can be tough to appreciate a historically significant shift happening right before your very eyes.\nStrategists at Goldman Sachs led by Peter Oppenheimer, the firm's chief global equity strategist, say it's time to recognize such a change that's already underway.\nThey call it the \"postmodern cycle,\" which they say is the fourth long secular bull run since World War II. The strategists see a structural shift in stocks, with new factors starting to drive returns \u2014 and by extension, new opportunities for investors.\n\"The reason we called it the 'Postmodern' cycle is that we thought it would have elements that mirrored experiences of historical cycles but would also contain distinct and unique drivers that would shape investment opportunities differently,\" the Goldman strategists wrote.\nDetailed below are the ways the current super cycle differs from past instances, as well as how the bank thinks investors can best position their investments for the new regime.\nHow the new era is different\nThere are three things that differentiate the postmodern period from previous structural eras, according to Goldman.\nHigh valuations. New structural bull markets tend to start off with stocks at low valuations. That doesn't look to be the case this time around, the bank said, pointing to the historically high S&P 500 Shiller price-to-earnings ratio, one measure of how expensive the S&P 500 is valued.\n\"So absolute returns are likely to be lower,\" the bank added of stocks.\nHigher interest rates and inflation. Goldman says inflation and, consequently, long-term interest rates, are likely to trend higher. That differs from the past two super cycles, where interest rates generally trended lower.\nInvestors have already been eyeing the threat that inflation will run hotter this year as companies begin to feel the impact of tariffs, which could lead them to raise prices for consumers. Hotter inflation also gives the Fed less room to cut interest rates, raising borrowing costs in the economy.\n\"Post-Covid inflation has triggered a rise in term premia,\" Goldman said, adding that they believed interest rates had \"little room to fall\" today.\nGovernment debt will swell. The government will likely continue to run up its balance sheet, Goldman said. That differs from past periods, such as during former President Bill Clinton's term in the late 1990s, when the US budget was in a surplus for the first time in decades.\nHigher debt levels are another factor driving up borrowing costs in the economy. That's because investors in the bond market are concerned about the sustainability of the US debt, causing Treasury yields to rise.\n\"Each of these may weigh on aggregate corporate profits, although we are likely to experience wider differences between winners and losers,\" strategists said.\nOpportunities\nWhile those changes are largely a net negative on equity prices, that's not to say there won't be bright areas of the market for investors. The bank also highlighted three \"mega trends\" that it believed could offer \"significant\" opportunities for investors:\nTechnology. The tech boom will likely continue to power the overall market, the bank said, pointing to the recent momentum in the AI trade. US tech stocks have largely been responsible for powering the overall market to fresh records in recent years, and large firms are still shelling out big to invest in AI.\n\"The ascent of technology in driving both economies and financial markets in recent years has further to go, in our view,\" strategists wrote.\nServices and Manufacturing. These two sectors are likely to \"generate opportunities\" for investors, given how technology will improve production, Goldman said.\n\"We are entering a period where a more symbiotic relationship between the virtual and physical worlds is developing. The promise of high returns from AI are not likely to be fulfilled without a significant ramp-up in physical infrastructure on data centres and electricity grids,\" strategists added.\nDiversify outside the US. While the US will likely lead the world in terms of investment returns, there'll be a broader range of opportunities in other countries, the bank suggested.\nStrategists pointed in particular to the All Country World Index ex. US exchange-traded fund, which is more cheaply valued relative to US assets.\n\"This is not an argument in favour of being underweight on the US, but rather in favour of being more open to undervalued opportunities elsewhere as a way of supplementing and diversifying from concentrated positions in the US index,\" the bank said."

      "text": "- We're in an AI boom. Is it going to play out like the first internet boom of the 1990s?\n- Probably, says Henry Blodget: That would mean lots of today's promising AI companies end up failing \u2014 but a few winners remain.\n- Blodget has particular insight into investment frenzies: He was a poster boy \u2014 and then a whipping boy \u2014 during the web bubble.\nIn the late 1990s, everyone was convinced that the internet was the future \u2014 and that by buying the stock of internet companies like the theGlobe.com you could get really rich.\nThey were half-right: You're reading this on the internet. But all that remains of theGlobe is a mothballed web domain.\nWe could see the same thing this time around with AI, says Henry Blodget. And he says that wouldn't be a bad thing.\nBlodget has a very particular perspective on booms and busts, since he was a central figure in the rise and fall of the first internet bubble. On the way up, he was a celebrated Wall Street analyst; afterward, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged him with fraud \u2014 a complaint he settled without admitting or denying guilt.\nAfter the dot-com era, Blodget went on to found the publication you're reading now (I was his first hire), and is now putting out his own publication and podcast.\nBlodget's bubble argument goes like this: We see them all the time, and they can often be a good thing, by focusing money and attention on important things. But they will also inevitably deflate \u2014 so the trick is figuring out how to play them. Which, for most people, involves not playing at all.\nBlodget and I talked about the AI boom and his new media aspirations in the latest episode of my Channels podcast. What follows is an edited excerpt of our conversation.\nPeter Kafka: You got a very close look at the internet bubble of the 1990s. How does it compare to what we're seeing now?\nHenry Blodget: This bubble phenomenon is the way markets and technology innovate.\nIt's often portrayed as a morality play: \"It's gonna end! It's so stupid. All this money is gonna be burned, and people are losing their minds.\"\nWhat's really going on is it's a huge R&D lab. Hundreds of billions of dollars, probably trillions at this point, are being thrown at something that most of us recognize as a huge future opportunity, the same way a lot of people recognized the internet as a huge future opportunity in the mid-1990s to late 1990s.\nAnd with any R&D, most of the experiments are going to fail.\nWhat is going to happen is that at some point, this amazing fundamental growth wave \u2014 which is amazing, people are buying and using these products, and there is a lot of revenue being generated and so forth \u2014 at some point, we are going to get out ahead of ourselves.\nWe're going to have a setback, and there's going to be a huge reordering of everything, and a whole bunch of companies are going to fail. And then the next generation of companies or the survivors from this first crash will go on and inherit the earth, and AI will be bigger than everybody thinks it will be, although different.\nThat is the consensus. I think it's probably right.\nThen the only question is where are we? Are we in 1996 or 1997? Or are we in the fall of 1999, right on the precipice of the crash? And what I will respectfully submit is that there is no way to be super-confident about that.\nThe premise here is that AI is real, and it's not going away. But some bubbles are just bubbles, right? People bought tulips and they went up in value. Or a couple of years ago, very serious people thought Web3 was a big deal worth taking seriously. It appears to have gone nowhere. Are you confident that AI is real and important things will come of it?\nI think so. I look at the adoption of Chat GPT and Claude and some of the other models. There is a lot of fundamental adoption there.\nAs many people have pointed out, there is not enough adoption or revenue to even begin to fund the extraordinary capital expenditures that are being made to provide these services.\nAnd one of the things that is worrisome is that the models seem to be progressing more slowly than people thought. And their usefulness is not increasing as fast as people thought. And most companies are actually really struggling with how to use it.\nLike companies that started a website in 1999 and then realized it didn't transform their business. They just had a website.\nRight. But it feels like this is real. If you look at what Open AI is already doing, the fundamental product is going gangbusters.\nThe problem with the valuations of all these stocks is that they are priced for the same kind of growth continuing for decades. So if you run into a problem like AOL ran into, which was they couldn't make the transition from dial-up to broadband, their valuation is going to get destroyed.\nUnlike the web bubble, you can't really be a stock-picker this time around: If you want to invest in an AI company, you can buy Nvidia, and that's about it.\nIf you're a normal person and you're interested in AI and you think this is real, but also a bubble, what do you do?\nFor most of us, the truth is you have a balanced portfolio of index funds with a good, healthy slug of cash and bonds in there. You don't bet on anything.\nOne of the things that makes this look very much like the 1990s bubble is how AI investing is now juicing the rest of the economy. A lot of the economic growth we're seeing right now is coming from these investments in data centers. Microsoft, Meta, and a few others are investing hundreds of billions in them.\nPaul Kedrosky wrote a great piece about how everyone's saying it's just like the railroads \u2014 you make the big investment up front and then you get the benefits for a long time.\nBut as Paul points out, this is not like laying a fiber line that is going to be great for the next 25 years, or a set of railroad tracks you can use over the next hundred years. These things have a three-to-four-year life.\nBecause Nvidia will come out with new chips. The current chips will be outmoded. A lot of this massive investment in data centers is going to be obsolete soon. There isn't a huge payback time.\nSo we are really setting up for a situation in which a lot of the fundamental performance is being juiced by every company in the world panicking and saying, \"I gotta invest in AI\". And all venture capital money is going there and so forth.\nAt some point, that party is likely to stop, and when it does, there's going to be this big reordering. Lots of companies will go.\nIt's not going to shock me if in seven years [we realize] OpenAI took a wrong turn two years ago and went down some path, and somebody else comes up with something new that is the Google of the era.\nAnd Google didn't really appear until 2000. They missed the whole 1990s, and yet they were the one that you wanted, because they got it right."

      "text": "- Billionaire Paul Singer's Elliott Management took a $4 billion stake in conglomerate Pepsi.\n- The feared activist investor believes the company's stock could rise by more than 50%, Elliott wrote in a letter to Pepsi.\n- Pepsi's C-suite does not need to worry, though \u2014 these big-name campaigns rarely turn into a big fight anymore.\nIt's never a good day when an activist investor announces a big stake in your company, with a public campaign pointing out the flaws in your strategy, even if it is expected.\nPepsi's leadership got to experience the thrill of receiving a letter from billionaire Paul Singer's Elliott Management informing them that their sprawling conglomerate was underperforming on Tuesday. Elliott's $4 billion stake in the consumer packaged goods and beverage behemoth comes with the expectation that changes will be made quickly.\n\"PepsiCo finds itself at a critical inflection point. The company has an opportunity \u2014 and an obligation \u2014 to improve financial performance and regain its position as an industry leader,\" the letter reads, noting that Pepsi's stock could soar more than 50% if it follows the hedge fund's recommendations.\nIn a different era, when Elliott was less institutional and managed less than half the $76 billion in assets it boasts today, a letter like this would send chills down the spine of Pepsi CEO Ramon Laguarta. Now, thanks to the growing scale of activists, the growth of corporate defense teams at investment banks, and regulatory tweaks, a campaign from a feared investor is closer to a McKinsey review than a corporate espionage-filled battle.\nYes, there'll be costs that will be cut or units to be sold, but the old-school activist tactics such as pressuring the CEO to step down, which earned Singer the title \"doomsday investor\" from the New Yorker in 2018, are not go-to moves. That's in part because activists no longer need to demonstrate their power to board members and executives.\nMarkets almost always agree with activists, and Pepsi's stock price bump Tuesday on the news of Elliott's stake is the latest example. Investors in hedge funds believe activism continues to be a winning strategy, as these managers now run close to $230 billion industrywide, according to HFR, an increase of 35% since 2022.\nSome activists don't even need to make noise to get a company to go along. A Barclays review of activist campaigns in the first half of the year found that settlements between companies and investors had risen compared to last year, boosting board seats allotted to investors and their choices by 16%. Close to half of the settlements this year came without a public campaign from a hedge fund, Barclays said, compared to 26% in 2023.\nAlready this year, financial analytics firm Charles River settled with Elliott. While there will still be one-off campaigns that become more heated \u2014 such as Elliott's proxy fight with Phillips66 or Trian's battle with Disney \u2014 big-name companies find it easier to rip the bandaid off than to fight what may end up being a losing battle.\nCarmen Lu, a partner at Paul Weiss who defends companies targeted by activists, said in a recent 13D Monitor report that \"many repeat activists have now developed familiar playbooks that help guide parties to what kind of resolution might be possible earlier on in a campaign.\"\n\"There are very few directors at vulnerable companies who reflexively want to fight if a good settlement is available. This is a major change from 20 or even ten years ago,\" Lu said.\nThis is especially true of the largest public companies that big-name investors target because they're the only ones big enough to move the needle.\nA column in the Financial Times about the Pepsi campaign summed up the current state of mega-cap campaigns: \"Sometimes, shareholder activism looks positively easy.\"\nThe paper predicts Pepsi to be a more challenging campaign than last year's quickly resolved Honeywell plan, thanks to the company's complexity, but acknowledged that \"what Elliot wants is elbow grease\" and that the fund is \"playing nice.\""

The browser has become a huge distribution channel for the company's search advertising business, sucking up vast amounts of useful data.\nGoogle's stock popped more than 6% in after-hours trading \u2014 something that Googlers also joked about inside the company.\n\"Sending support to Googlers who sold $GOOG recently,\" read one caption on a picture of a candle.\nSeveral employees who spoke to Business Insider on the condition of anonymity said they didn't think the outcome would affect them much and that it would be business as usual for most Googlers.\n\"I think people are mostly happy about the stock,\" said one of them.\nThe list of remedies handed down to Google on Tuesday included a ban on any exclusive deals to make its search engine the default, though it stopped short of banning payments to partners completely. Google was also ordered to share some of its search data with rivals.\nA Google spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\nHave something to share?

      "text": "- Amazon is testing new AI-powered agentic workplace software, internal documents show.\n- The new technology will let companies design custom agents for business and team needs.\n- Early users include BMW, Intuit, and Koch Industries, according to one of the documents.\nAmazon is about to enter the AI agent race in a big way, giving the tech giant another chance to make progress in the lucrative enterprise software market.\nThe Seattle-based company is testing new agentic, AI-powered workspace software called Quick Suite, according to internal documents viewed by Business Insider.\nQuick Suite empowers \"every business user to make better decisions, faster, and act on them swiftly by unifying Al agents for business insights, deep research, and automation into a single experience,\" according to one of the documents, marked confidential.\nSeveral companies have been given a private preview of the new technology, and Amazon recently sent out invitations for an internal beta test.\nQuick Suite positions AWS to compete more aggressively in AI with agent-driven automation. Agents are the latest frontier in generative AI, designed to take action and independently use tools to complete tasks. Companies such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, OpenAI, and Salesforce \u2014 along with a host of smaller startups \u2014 are racing to be the main providers of agentic tools.\nAnother crack at SaaS\nThis is also another chance for Amazon to make a dent in the huge market for enterprise software and applications, known as SaaS. While the company is a pioneer in cloud computing, it's made less of a mark so far with software that runs on top of this infrastructure.\n\"With over 40% of business users expected to adopt Al-enhanced work environments soon, AWS is positioned to lead this shift by providing integrated solutions that help organizations \u2014 including our own \u2014 effectively deploy and scale Al agents in the workplace,\" Amazon's beta test invitation states.\nBusiness Insider previously reported that Amazon was working on a unified \"agentic\" AI workspace, internally codenamed Q Business Suite, with \"Quick\" floated as a potential brand name.\n\"We are seeing strong growth of Amazon Q Business with customers like Remitly, Nasdaq, and Smartsheet, along with partners like Zoom and Asana, adopting it to provide employees with generative AI assistance to transform how work gets done,\" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement.\n\"Similarly, we are seeing customers like BMW and GoDaddy embrace Amazon QuickSight in order to make data-driven decisions quickly,\" the spokesperson added. \"We're building on this strong response with even more innovation to help customers realize the benefits of agentic AI in the workplace.\"\nMerging existing AWS products\nQuick Suite will merge some of AWS's existing products, such as its data analysis platform QuickSight and its AI chatbot Q Business, while also adding a new product called Quick Flows, according to another of the documents.\nQuick Flows provides pre-built workflows that let customers automate tasks through natural language prompts, one of the documents explained.\nQuick Suite will include a \"deep research agent\" to generate reports from company and external data, and will also enable customers to create custom agents for \"specific business functions or team needs,\" which can then be shared across their organization, one of the documents said.\nBeta testers and early feedback\nAmazon is inviting a \"select group of beta testers\" for Quick Suite and has already offered a \"private preview\" to at least 50 companies, the documents said.\nIt's unclear when Amazon plans to officially launch Quick Suite. The tentative launch date has already been delayed from mid-July to September, one of the documents said.\nQuick Suite has received mixed feedback from beta users, according to one of the internal documents.\nCustomers praised its simpler setup and more intuitive design compared to Q Business, as well as its \"compelling\" deep research feature for both internal and external use. The ability to connect with external tools, such as Atlassian's Jira, has also been well received.\nAt the same time, some testers reported frustrations with networking limitations in virtual cloud environments and onerous permission requirements for linking data sources. Early users include BMW, Intuit, and Koch Industries, the document said.\nQuick Suite's launch represents a turning point in AWS's AI application strategy. Q Business had been intended as the company's flagship offering for business users, but AWS is now making Quick Suite a priority, as BI previously reported.\nHave a tip?

      "text": "- After Donald Trump's election in 2016, all kinds of US lawmakers vowed to rein in American Big Tech companies.\n- But Congress never passed any meaningful laws doing that.\n- Now there doesn't seem to be any energy about regulating Big Tech at all.\nIn 2024, in what seemed like a landmark ruling, a federal judge said Google had an illegal monopoly in search.\nOn Tuesday, that same judge unveiled Google's punishment, which amounts to \u2026 not too much, all things considered.\nThere are plenty of places to find analysis of Judge Amit Mehta's ruling, but the fastest way to process it is to see what Wall Street thinks: Google stock is up 9% on Wednesday.\nAnd if you take a few more seconds, you can see how the specter of a major antitrust case has affected Google since the US government first filed suit in October 2020. Back then, a share of Google was worth about $80. On Wednesday, it's $231.\nThat is: Google investors have spent years mostly ignoring the idea that the company could face severe punishment from US regulators. This week confirmed that they were correct.\nSo maybe it's time to formally acknowledge that the larger push in the US to break up, or simply rein in, Big Tech is basically over.\nThat effort started in the mid-2010s, but really sped up after Donald Trump's first election in 2016. Back then, there was lots of talk about the fact that giant US tech companies had grown enormously powerful over the past couple decades, with very little oversight from anyone in the US government. There was bipartisan interest in changing that, we were told \u2014 even though it seemed clear that Democrats and Republicans had radically different criticisms of American tech companies.\nMany hearings were held. Giant reports were produced. And in both the Trump and Biden administrations, the US government investigated and then sued most of the Big Tech companies for abusing their power.\nBut in that same time, Congress never came close to passing any meaningful legislation that would restrain any American Big Tech companies from doing anything. (The sole anti-Big Tech law Congress did pass was directed at China's TikTok, and Trump has decided to simply ignore that law.)\nDuring Joe Biden's tenure, his antitrust enforcers did try to restrain tech companies, partially through lawsuits, and partially through the threat of suits. That certainly upset part of the Silicon Valley ecosystem, but it didn't seem to meaningfully constrain the biggest players.\nAnd now, in the Trump 2.0 era, Big Tech and Trump seem united in their opposition to most regulations.\nSo all that's left of the anti-Big Tech push are federal lawsuits, which remain in place against the likes of Amazon, Apple, and Meta. It's still possible that one of those could result in a major loss for a Big Tech company \u2014 though even if that happens, appeals will stretch on for years.\nBut this week we saw what happens when the US government actually wins a court case against a Big Tech company \u2014 not that much at all.\nThat doesn't mean the Biggest Tech companies will always remain that way. Maybe other entities, like the European Union, will end up effectively regulating American tech. Or, as Mehta himself acknowledged in his ruling this week, new competitors, like OpenAI, will end up dethroning the giants.\nBut if you thought American lawmakers or courts would do it, this week might be the last time you think that way for a long time."

      "text": "- Amazon's strict return-to-office policy is limiting its recruitment efforts.\n- The policy requires employees to work in an office 5 days a week and relocate to hubs.\n- Amazon's AI reputation and pay structure also challenge its ability to attract talent.\nAmazon's 5-day return-to-office policy may be restoring discipline, but it's costing the company in the war for tech talent.\nAn internal document and accounts from Amazon insiders show that the company's aggressive in-office work policy and requirement to move near designated \"hub\" offices are hampering recruiting efforts.\nThe hub strategy is listed as one of the \"hotly debated topics\" for Amazon's recruiters, as it is limiting the ability to hire \"high-demand talent, like those with GenAI skills,\" according to the internal document from late last year, obtained by Business Insider.\nSome Amazon recruiters told Business Insider that, starting last year, they saw an increase in candidates declining job offers specifically because of RTO. Those people were open to lower pay from other companies in exchange for the flexibility to work remotely.\nOne of the recruiters said the company is losing out on tech talent due to this. The people who spoke with Business Insider asked not to be identified discussing sensitive topics.\nIn addition to the strict RTO rules, Amazon has flagged its unusual pay structure and lagging AI reputation as obstacles to recruitment, BI previously reported.\nThe stakes are high. Amazon is racing to stay ahead in the highly competitive generative AI space, but without attracting top talent, the company risks falling behind.\nOracle, for example, has hired away more than 600 Amazon employees in the past 2 years because Amazon's strict RTO policy has made poaching easier, Bloomberg reported recently.\nIn an email to BI, Amazon's spokesperson said that the premise of this story was wrong, adding that the company continues to attract and retain some of the best people in the world.\"\n\"We are always looking for ways to optimize our recruiting strategies and looking at alternate talent rich locations,\" the spokesperson said.\nMany firms are tightening RTO, but Amazon stands out. It demands 5 days in-office and ties compliance to promotions and performance reviews. Those who refuse to relocate to \"hubs\" are considered by Amazon to have voluntarily resigned.\n\"We continue to believe that teams produce the best results when they're collaborating and inventing in person, and we've observed that to be true now that we've had most people back in the office each day for some time,\" the Amazon spokesperson said.\nWall Street is already noticing. A recent report by venture capital firm SignalFire found Amazon on the lower end of engineer retention, behind Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic.\nHave a tip?

      "text": "- After Spirit filed for bankruptcy for a second time, Frontier is set to benefit.\n- Deutsche Bank analysts upgraded Frontier's stock rating, and its share price jumped 14.5%.\n- With Spirit likely to consolidate and cut routes, passengers will have fewer carrier options.\nSpirit Airlines' latest bankruptcy filing has Wall Street tapping its rival to flourish.\nFrontier Airlines' share price jumped 14.5% on Tuesday, as Deutsche Bank analysts upgraded the stock to a \"Buy\" rating.\nThey also doubled their 12-month price target from $4 to $8. The stock last closed trading at $5.61.\nDeutsche Bank's Michael Linenberg wrote that Frontier is \"best-positioned to be the biggest beneficiary of Spirit's bankruptcy\" because it competes the most with the struggling budget airline.\nWhen Spirit warned of financial difficulties last month, Frontier's stock soared 29%.\nIn a Monday note titled \"Spirit's Dismay Is Rivals' Pay Day,\" Jefferies' Savanthi Syth was also bullish on Frontier.\nBoth notes estimated that, for the fourth quarter, around 40% of routes offered by Frontier will also be offered by Spirit.\nThat comes after Frontier announced 20 new routes last week, only two of which didn't overlap with ones offered by Spirit.\nSyth also said that JetBlue could benefit from its 26% overlap with Spirit's flight network. Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines followed, at just under one in five.\nFrontier's planned new routes largely focus on major Spirit hubs like Fort Lauderdale, its home base, and Detroit.\nMeanwhile, as part of its restructuring during the Chapter 11 process, Spirit plans to redesign its network to focus on such key markets.\nIt also said it would \"rightsize\" its fleet of aircraft.\nThe Deutsche Bank analysts said Spirit has a total fleet of 214, but utilizes 157 of them. 19 of those that are grounded are being prepared to be sold, while the other 38 aren't flying due to an issue with their Pratt & Whitney engines.\n\"Based on management commentary around potential aircraft savings per the bankruptcy filings, we would not be surprised to see the active fleet shrink by another ~50 aircraft,\" the note said.\nWhile this could all spell good news for Frontier and its investors, it's likely to be harder for people hoping to fly on a budget.\nJefferies previously reported that fares are 15% lower on routes where Frontier and Spirit compete. Spirit shrinking means that other airlines could therefore raise prices."

It highlights the mixed reactions within tech giants, such as Google's antitrust win and Amazon's new AI agent platform, while noting broader industry trends like increased AI adoption among interns and the cautious stance of firms on talent recruitment. The piece underscores the gap between hype and actual revenue generation, citing a MIT study that only 5% of companies convert AI into revenue, and suggests that the market will adjust to a more measured pace of AI-driven transformation.",
