      "feedback": "Remove all duplicated and extraneous rows, keep only four concise “Up/Down” lines, each with a single driver, a clear watch‑list item, and a probability that reflects the evidence (e.g., 60 % for the Fed‑cut base case, 40 % for the hawkish risk). Use canonical handles with explicit sign/magnitude: e.g., dxy +0.5–1 % for the September 25 cut, spx –1–3 % for the Q3 tech earnings miss, ust10y +0.2–0.4 % for a tariff escalation. Cite the source IDs inline only when stating a specific fact or number (e.g., (B1KYJ1GPU) for the Fed cut, (Z7O1DCHS7) for the 2‑yr/10‑yr steepening). After the four lines, add a single swing‑trade line (or outlook if not tradable) that follows the required format: Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence 0–100. Ensure the trade uses a liquid handle (e.g., dxy futures or spx index futures), sets realistic entry/stop levels (e.g., entry at 98.0, stop at 97.5, target at 99.0 for dxy), and includes a clear invalidation trigger (e.g., Fed rate hike >25 bp). Drop any numeric placeholders (98.20, 97.90, etc.) that are not tied to a handle or catalyst. Finally, verify that every line contains a catalyst window (e.g., Sep 12 2025 FOMC, Sep 25 2025 Fed cut, Aug 30 PCE) and that the probability is justified by the cited evidence. This will satisfy the acceptance gate and produce a world‑class, actionable macro outlook.",
