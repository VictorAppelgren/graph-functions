      "text": "Powell hints at September rate cut despite tariff risks, sending Dow up 900 points\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a possible interest rate cut in September \u2013 sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging over 900 points.\nWhile the Fed has for months warned that tariffs could reheat inflation, Powell added a weakening labor market to its list of concerns \u2014 adding that these risks could warrant a rate cut to support economic growth.\nThe labor market has remained stable, but \u201cit is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers,\u201d Powell said, referencing intense deportation efforts under the Trump administration and a widespread pause on hiring in many sectors.\nThe Dow soared 915 points, or 2%, by approximately 12:45 p.m. ET. The blue-chip index closed up 846.24 points, or 1.9%, at a record close of 45,631.74.\nThe Nasdaq jumped nearly 400 points, or 1.9%, while the S&P 500 gained almost 100 points, or 1.5%.\nTraders priced in about a 90% chance of the Fed issuing a quarter-point cut in September soon after Powell\u2019s speech started \u2013 a 20% jump from earlier in the day, according to CME FedWatch.\nIt follows months of pressure from President Trump, who has pushed for immediate interest rate cuts as he has insisted that tariffs will not hike prices.\nChris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Northlight Asset Management, said that Powell\u2019s hint at rate cuts was unexpected.\n\u201cAs usual, he didn\u2019t say it directly, and he gave himself an out in case the data goes the wrong way\u2026 but the bar is extremely high now for the Fed to leave rates unchanged in less than a month,\u201d Zaccarelli said in a note Friday.\nThe president has been doggedly pushing the Fed to slash interest rates by as much as 3 percentage points, blasting Powell as \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201chardheaded.\u201d\nLast month, Trump took aim at the Fed\u2019s $2.5 billion headquarter renovations, questioning the project\u2019s costs.\nWhile Trump has backed off initial calls to replace Powell, the Department of Justice this week reportedly opened an investigation into Fed Governor Lisa Cook after Trump urged the Biden appointee to resign over allegations of mortgage fraud.\nPowell signaled that the impact of tariffs might be \u201cshort lived \u2013 a one-time shift in the price level.\u201d\nHowever, he said it \u201cwill continue to take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks.\u201d\n\u201cMoreover, tariff rates continue to evolve, potentially prolonging the adjustment process.\u201d\nPowell also discussed changes to a goal the Fed adopted five years ago during the pandemic and Black Lives Matter protests.\nThe new framework allowed the Fed to let inflation rise if unemployment was trending higher, especially among underrepresented groups.\nPowell said that idea \u201cproved irrelevant,\u201d as the last five years served as a \u201cpainful reminder of the hardship that high inflation imposes.\u201d\nHe reaffirmed the Fed\u2019s commitment to reaching a 2% inflation target.\nCentral bankers have been split on interest-rate policy, with Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman voting in July in favor of immediately lowering rates.\nIt marked the first meeting in three decades where more than one governor on the 12-member board has dissented on an interest-rate vote.\nMeanwhile, tensions over economic data are high after Trump abruptly fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics following a dismal July jobs report that revealed the labor market has actually been slowing for months.\nBut minutes from the Fed committee\u2019s July meeting revealed most members are more concerned about the risk of inflation."

      "text": "Google warns Gmail users to update passwords, advises extra security measures after Salesforce breach\nGoogle has warned Gmail users to update their passwords and strengthen their account security as password hackers have carried out a significant amount of \u201csuccessful intrusions.\u201d\nIt is advising Gmail\u2019s users \u2014 roughly 2.5 billion people \u2014 to be on high alert for suspicious activity and add extra security measures, like two-factor authentication, if they have not already.\nHackers often access Gmail passwords by sending emails with links to fake sign-in pages, or by tricking users into sharing their two-factor authentication codes.\nWhile most users have strong, unique passwords, only a third regularly update these keys, according to Google data.\nIn a blog post on Monday, Google said the reminder to update passwords was not indicative of \u201ca major Gmail security issue.\u201d\nThe reminder to update passwords was routine and \u201cGmail\u2019s protections are strong and effective,\u201d Google said.\nSeparately, Google has also advised customers to ramp up their security measures after a breach of its own Salesforce database.\nIn June, it warned that bad actors were targeting people through social engineering attacks \u2013 posing as IT support staffers, which was \u201cparticularly effective in tricking employees,\u201d Google said.\nThis hack largely compromised publicly available data, like contact details for small- and medium-size businesses, but the hacking method could be used for more serious attacks in the future.\n\u201cWe believe threat actors using the \u2018ShinyHunters\u2019 brand may be preparing to escalate their extortion tactics by launching a data leak site (DLS),\u201d Google said in a June blog post.\n\u201cThese new tactics are likely intended to increase pressure on victims, including those associated with the recent UNC6040 Salesforce-related data breaches.\u201d\nIt notified all users impacted by this incident via email on Aug. 8.\nShinyHunters, which seemingly pulls its name from the Pok\u00e9mon franchise, formed in 2020 and has since been linked to several high-profile breaches of firms like AT&T, Microsoft, Santander and Ticketmaster."

      "text": "Cracker Barrel co-founder, 93, slams CEO after \u2018pitiful\u2019 rebranding fail: \u2018Throwing money out the window\u2019\nThe 93-year-old co-founder of Cracker Barrel blasted the homestyle restaurant chain\u2019s execs for allowing changes that damaged the 56-year-old business as he urged CEO Julie Felss Masino to leave the logo alone.\nTommy Lowe, co-founder of the first Cracker Barrel in 1969, accused the former Taco Bell executive of trying to rival the chain\u2019s widely criticized $700 million modernization effort.\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to modernize to be like the competition \u2014 Cracker Barrel doesn\u2019t have any competition,\u201d Lowe told WTVF Thursday. \u201cI heard she was at Taco Bell. What\u2019s Taco Bell know about Cracker Barrel and country food? They need to work on the food and service and leave the barrel \u2014 the logo alone.\u201d\nThe nonagenarian\u2019s comments come after Cracker Barrel executives reversed course on a much despised logo redesign that removed the famous \u201cbarrel\u201d and Uncle Herschel from the chain\u2019s branding.\nLowe slammed the rebrand as \u201cpitiful\u201d \u2014 saying Masino didn\u2019t understand Cracker Barrel\u2019s identity because of her background in fast food.\n\u201cSpending $700 million dollars doing that is throwing money out the window,\u201d he said.\nLowe claims Masino doesn\u2019t know who he is and revealed he has never met with the executive since she was named Cracker Barrel\u2019s President and CEO in July 2023.\nMasino began implementing changes to the menu, interior design and prices soon after assuming the coveted position in November.\nThe initial changes went under the radar for most customers, but Masino\u2019s most recent alteration raised eyebrows across the nation.\nLowe, who served as Cracker Barrel\u2019s Vice President of Operations and held a decades-long seat on the board of directors, said Masino was trying to compete with competition that didn\u2019t exist.\nFollowing the immense backlash and plunging stocks, Cracker Barrel executives decided to reverse course and return to the \u201cOld Timer\u201d logo.\n\u201cWe thank our guests for sharing your voices and love for Cracker Barrel,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe said we would listen, and we have. Our new logo is going away and our \u2018old timer\u2019 will remain.\u201d\nThe about-face followed days of protests on social media against Cracker Barrel\u2019s rebranding efforts \u2014 capped on Tuesday with Trump weighing in and advising the company to go back to the original logo design.\nLowe recalled a \u201cGrand Ole Opry\u201d man named String Bean who had warned the restaurant in its infant stage to \u201ckeep it country.\u201d\nHe reiterated the alert to the current leaders, warning the business would falter if they didn\u2019t listen.\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t get back to keeping it country, then it ain\u2019t gonna work,\u201d Lowe told the outlet.\nThe first store was built along Highway 109 in Lebanon, Tenn., after co-founder Dan Evins wanted to build a gas station but needed something more appealing to get more customers.\nEvins, who died in 2012, brought in Lowe, a construction business owner, to build a restaurant to accompany the station and provide for truckers who drove through the area.\n\u201cIt was just a country store for country people and that\u2019s what it is today, they just don\u2019t understand,\u201d Lowe said.\nLowe says it took \u201cforever\u201d to get 10 investors to fund the $10,000 needed to build the store.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a bet at all,\u201d he said on the challenges faced in getting up and running.\nThe partners managed to get off the ground, opening the first store on Sept. 19, 1969, eventually expanding the chain to over 650 locations in 44 states."

      "text": "Family sues Tesla after Cybertruck owner dies in 5,000-degree inferno, causing bones to disintegrate\nA Tesla owner was burned alive in his Cybertruck after the stainless-steel beast erupted in a 5,000-degree inferno so intense it caused his bones to disintegrate, according to a wrongful death lawsuit filed in Texas.\nMichael Sheehan, 47, bought the futuristic pickup in April 2024. Just three months later on Aug. 3, the truck veered off-road, slammed into a culvert and burst into flames near Beach City, around 30 miles east of Houston.\nThe raging fire trapped Sheehan inside the vehicle as the batteries powering the $100,000 SUV went into catastrophic failure, court filings say. The blaze was so hot Sheehan\u2019s skeletal system literally fractured from the heat.\n\u201cHe was eight inches shorter in length than he was before he burned,\u201d attorney S. Scott West told The Independent. \u201cThat\u2019s thermal fracture.\u201d\nSheehan\u2019s widow, Shannon, and his parents filed the suit in June, accusing Tesla of selling a vehicle so defectively designed it transformed a survivable crash into a fiery death.\n\u201cThis was a single-vehicle crash,\u201d the petition states. \u201cThe crash forces were survivable\u2026 except for the fire, ergonomic shortcomings, and deficient crashworthiness.\u201d\nWest, a former industrial design engineer turned trial lawyer, blasted the company\u2019s priorities.\n\u201cNot only are you riding on top of 3,000 pounds of batteries, this \u2018spaceship\u2019 design is a double-edged sword,\u201d West told The Independent.\nHe alleged Tesla put aesthetics ahead of basic safety, making it nearly impossible for Sheehan to escape once the truck lost power. Instead, Sheehan found himself locked in a firetrap.\nThe lawsuit says the Cybertruck\u2019s electrically operated doors can\u2019t be opened once power is cut. Exterior handles fail, and the manual release latches inside are \u201cunreasonably difficult to locate in an emergency.\u201d\nTesla, the filing continues, gave owners \u201cinsufficient warnings or training\u201d on how to exit post-crash.\n\u201cMichael was a Mensa-level guy, very, very smart,\u201d West told The Independent.\n\u201cBut when Tesla delivered this [Cybertruck] to him, the instructions they gave him were woefully inadequate to handle a situation like this.\u201d\nWest acknowledged that Sheehan had alcohol in his system, a fact noted in the complaint. But, he argued, \u201cthat shouldn\u2019t sign his death warrant.\u201d\nIn fact, the lawsuit also targets 3180 Bar, LLC, doing business as The Barn Whiskey Bar, where Sheehan was allegedly overserved on the night of the crash.\nAttorneys accuse the bar of continuing to serve Sheehan despite his condition and failing to intervene or provide safe alternatives.\nSheehan, who worked as a registered nurse, was remembered by loved ones as a devoted husband with a \u201cgentle spirit.\u201d\nHis obituary said he loved cooking for family and friends, was passionate about zombie movies, and lived life \u201cauthentically\u201d and \u201cunapologetically.\u201d\n\u201cKnowing and loving Michael was a true joy,\u201d his obituary read. \u201cHe made a profound impact on so many lives. He was unique, authentic, caring, funny and he lived his life unapologetically.\u201d\nSheehan was the first person to die in a Cybertruck crash since the model launched in November 2023, according to The Independent.\nMonths later, three college students in California were burned to death in another Cybertruck wreck.\nIn April, USC basketball recruit Alijah Arenas \u2014 son of former NBA star Gilbert Arenas \u2014 was placed in an induced coma after a fiery Cybertruck crash in Los Angeles.\nTesla has recalled the Cybertruck at least eight times since launch for problems ranging from accelerator pedals that detached to body panels that delaminated.\nThe model has also suffered steep depreciation on resale and sluggish sales as rivals gain ground.\nWest said he hopes the Sheehan case forces Tesla and Elon Musk to finally confront the dangers of their vehicles.\n\u201cEvery religion has a version of hell, and every version of hell has fire,\u201d he told The Independent.\n\u201cIt is the most excruciating and longest torture of any death. The nerves are literally exposed to everything. It\u2019s horrific.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cThere\u2019s my challenge to Elon. Put me out of business. Make these vehicles so safe that I don\u2019t have to do this anymore.\u201d\nTesla and The Barn Whiskey Bar did not respond to a request for comment."
