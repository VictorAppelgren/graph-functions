  "content": "This press release contains forward-looking information that is based upon assumptions and is subject to risks and uncertainties as indicated in the cautionary note contained within this press release. TORONTO, August 11, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--DREAM UNLIMITED CORP. (TSX: DRM) (\"Dream\") and CentreCourt Developments (\"CentreCourt\") are pleased to announce their new joint venture to co-develop 49 Ontario St., a mixed-income purpose-built rental community in downtown Toronto. A significant affordable housing component will be included, setting a new benchmark for integrated, vibrant urban living in the city\u2019s core. The 49 Ontario St. development directly addresses Toronto\u2019s urgent need for housing, adding significant supply to one of Canada\u2019s most in-demand markets. Earlier this year, Dream Impact Trust (TSX: MPCT.UN), the current owner of the redevelopment site, secured up to $647.6 million in government-affiliated financing and obtained waivers for development charges from the City of Toronto for the 800,000 sf multi-family project. Upon completion, the development will feature 1,226 multi-family units, with 22% designated as affordable housing. Dream and CentreCourt have a 14-year history of successfully delivering landmark condominium communities together. While both organizations have deep expertise across the real estate spectrum, this joint venture represents a significant step in expanding their collaboration into purpose-built rental. CentreCourt is recognized for its industry-leading ability to finance, design, and self-perform construction at unmatched speed and efficiency, delivering high build-quality along with exceptional returns on 19 projects totaling over 10,000 homes and $5.6 billion in development value. Dream brings a deep track record in purpose-built rental and unparalleled expertise in structuring and executing public-private partnerships, having developed or currently developing over 4,500 rental units worth over $2 billion upon full build-out. \"We believe the skills and expertise that have made us leaders in condominium development will be just as valuable in purpose-built rental,\" said Gavin Cheung, Managing Partner & President, CentreCourt. \"49 Ontario St. will deliver much-needed market rental and affordable housing to downtown Toronto, and we\u2019re excited to be partnering with Dream to make it happen.\" \"Dream has been at the forefront of delivering purpose-built rental through innovative public-private partnerships,\" said Jamie Cooper, President of Development and Income Properties, Dream. \"Working with CentreCourt on 49 Ontario St. brings together complementary strengths to deliver a project that will serve the community for decades to come.\"\n\nBuilding on the 49 Ontario St. partnership, Dream and CentreCourt are working closely together to identify and pursue additional purpose-built rental opportunities in anticipation of the policies announced or under consideration by various levels of governments aimed at accelerating housing development. This includes the federal initiatives such as the MURB policy, the new Build Canada Homes strategy, reductions in development charges, and other measures at the federal, provincial and municipal levels.
