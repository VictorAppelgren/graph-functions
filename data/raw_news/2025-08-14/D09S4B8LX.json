  "description": "\"Balance of Power: Late Edition\" focuses on the intersection of politics and global business. On tonight's show, Rep. Ralph Norman (R) South Carolina discusses the latest on the tax bill and states that the legislation does not have the support to pass on the House floor. Senator Bill Hagerty (R) Tennessee talks about whether or not he'd make any changes to the tax bill, and Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D) Maryland states she would vote no on the legislation as it cuts health care coverage for hundreds of thousands of people in her district. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "> > FROM THE WORLD OF POLITICS TO THE WORLD OF BUSINESS, THIS IS BALANCE OF POWER. FROM WASHINGTON, D.C. > > FROM OUR STUDIOS TO OUR TV AND RADIO AUDIENCES, WELCOME TO BALANCE OF POWER. TONIGHT, SPREADING TOWARDS A VOTE. HOUSE REPUBLICANS WORK FURIOUSLY TO GET TRUMP'S BILLED TO THE FINISH LINE WITH A POTENTIAL VOTE HOURS FROM NOW. > > THAT CANNOT HAPPEN UNTIL HE GETS OUT OF THE RULES COMMITTEE, WHICH HAS BEEN CONSIDERING THE MEASURE FOR 16 HOURS. AND A MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH HOLD OUT LAWMAKERS FROM THE CONSERVATIVE FREEDOM CAUCUS, THREATS TO TANK THE BILL BY REFUSING FOR IT TO GO TO THE FLOOR AS SOME MEMBERS TAKE ISSUE WITH THE SALT BILL. > > RIPPLE EFFECTS OF THE INDECISION WITH WEAK DEMAND IN THE $16 BILLION TREASURY AUCTION , STOCKS, BONDS ON THE DOLLAR ALL FELL OVER CONCERNS OF DEFICIT AND DEBT. WE HAVE REPORTERS COVERING THE HILL AND WHITE HOUSE TONIGHT AND LAWMAKERS REACTING TO THE NEWS WHEN RALPH NORMAN JOINS US IN A FEW MOMENTS. WE WILL ALSO HERE FROM TENNESSEE SENATOR BILL HAGGERTY ON WHAT HAPPENS IF THE BILL PASSES THE HOUSE. WE START EXPANDED COVERAGE WITH ERIK WASSON ON CAPITOL HILL. HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO A VOTE? > > I THINK IT COULD BE TOMORROW. FREEDOM CAUCUS MEMBERS ARE DIGGING IN AND WERE PESSIMISTIC EARLIER IN THE DAY, HOLDING AN IMPROMPTU PRESS CONFERENCE TO ANNOUNCE THEY BELIEVE THE BILL SHOULD PROBABLY PASS NEXT WEEK OR THE WEEK AFTER GIVEN HOW FAR APART MEMBERS ARE. THE REAL ISSUE IS FREEDOM CAUCUS MEMBERS ARE ASKING FOR THINGS LIKE ENDING GREEN ENERGY TAX CREDITS IMMEDIATELY ON ONGOING PROJECTS THAT COULD IMPACT COMPANIES THAT HAVE ALREADY INVESTED, BANKS THAT ALREADY INVESTED IN RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS SO THAT IS GETTING PUSHED BACK. SOME THINGS THEY ARE ASKING FOR OUR NOT UNCONTROVERSIAL, EVEN IF THE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO AND THESE THERE WILL BE ECONOMIC PAIN SO THEY ARE TRYING TO THREAD THE ISSUE AND THERE IS AN ISSUE ON MEDICAID, A LOT OF STATE BUDGETS WOULD BE IMPACTED BY A FEDERAL WITHDRAWAL FUNDING FOR MEDICAID RECIPIENTS SO PRESSURE FROM STATES ON MODERATE MEMBERS TO OPPOSE THIS SO WE WILL HAVE TO SEE WHAT KIND OF DEAL THEY COME UP WITH WHEN THEY RETURNED TO CAPITOL HILL SHORTLY. > > WE KNOW YOU WILL HAVE IT COVERED FOR US. THANK YOU SO MUCH. FOR MORE WE TURN TO REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN AND MEMBER OF THE HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS TO NORMAN OF SOUTH CAROLINA. WELCOME TO BLOOMBERG, IT IS GOOD TO HAVE YOU. YOU WERE NOT AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH SOME OF YOUR COLLEAGUES. DOES THAT MEAN WE SHOULD NO LONGER CONSIDER YOU A HOLD OUT? ARE YOU PREPARED TO VOTE YES REGARDLESS OF WHAT EMERGES FROM THE MEETING? > > I THINK THE SPEAKER PICKS WHO GOES. I HAVE BEEN IN RULES ALL DAY. THEY ARE CAPABLE OF HANDLING WHATEVER NEEDS TO HAPPEN. THE TAX CUT PLAN WILL BE PUT OUT LONG AS WE DO NOT GET THE TAX CUTS AND THE BILL I THINK WILL PASS WHETHER WE GET WHAT WE NEED, IT WILL PASS THE RULES COMMITTEE. THE QUESTION IS IF IT WILL PASS ON THE FLOOR AND IT DOES NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT TO. IT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER IN YOUR SHOW, OUR DEBT HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED THREE TIMES, BY THREE MAJOR AGENCIES. FINCH, MOODY'S, S & P. I DO NOT KNOW HOW MUCH MORE OF A WAKE-UP CALL WE NEED TO GET OUR HOUSE IN ORDER SO ALL WE ARE ASKING FOR, AND YOU MENTIONED THE SALT PROVISION, ALL WE ARE ASKING FOR IS YOU NEED TO PAY FOR ANY EXPENSE YOU HAVE AND THE SALT PROVISION COSTS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ON SOLAR CREDITS, NO, MIKE JOHNSON GAVE ME A LIST OF EVERYBODY THAT HAD ONGOING BUSINESS AND I SAID SPEAKER, GRANDFATHER THOSE IN, I WOULD NOT TAKE THEIR BUSINESS AWAY FROM THEM BUT ANY NEW SOLAR CREDITS NEED TO BE WEEDED OUT AND TRUMP CAMPAIGNED ON THIS AND WHEN HE WAS AT OUR CAUCUS MEETING, HE CAMPAIGN ON WASTE, FRAUD, MEDICAID, WHICH IS RAMPANT AND HE SAID DO NOT DO THE SALT PROVISION. WE THOUGHT WE HAD AN AGREEMENT, SO WAS CAP TO 10000 AND THEN 4009 NO OFFSETS SO THAT IS THE HEART OF THE MATTER. I THINK THIS BILL WILL PASS WITH MODIFICATIONS. WE ARE NOT BEING UNREASONABLE. THE DATE AND HAS TO PASS IS NOT OFFICIAL. THE SENATE WILL SIT ON IT FOR WHO KNOWS HOW LONG BUT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP [INDISCERNIBLE] TO GET IT DONE. > > I KNOW YOU STARTED AT 1:00 A.M. AND THERE IS NO SIGNS OF IT ENDING YET. THIS IS A LIVE VIEW A VERY TIRED LAWMAKERS WHO JUST INTRODUCED A NEW PANEL TO THE CONVERSATION. I WANT TO GET BACK TO THE MATTER OF SALT. WE SPOKE WITH ONE OF THE MOST VOCIFEROUS MEMBERS OF THE SALT CAUCUS, YOUR COLLEAGUE FROM NEW YORK MIKE LAWLER, TALKING ABOUT THE DEAL THAT APPEARS TO BE IN HAND IF THE SALT CAUCUS IS UNIFIED BEHIND IT. > > MEMBERS OF THE SALT CAUCUS NEGOTIATED YESTERDAY IN GOOD FAITH WITH LEADERSHIP, WITH THE ADMINISTRATION, WE SETTLED ON SOMETHING WE BELIEVE IN AND SUPPORT. OBVIOUSLY WE ARE WAITING FOR THE FINAL DETAILS TO EMERGE OUT OF THE RULES COMMITTEE BUT WE MADE GREAT PROGRESS YESTERDAY. I FEEL MUCH BETTER ABOUT WHERE THE BILL IS AS A RESULT. > > SO HERE WE ARE, SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ARE HAPPY ABOUT THIS, OTHERS ARE NOT. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT WITH THE SALT DEAL THE BILL JUST GOT WORSE? > > MIKE LAWLER IS A FRIEND OF MINE AND A GOOD NEGOTIATOR BUT HE IS NEGOTIATING FOR HIS STATE. TRUMP CALLED OUT MIKE LAWLER AND SAID IF YOU ARE DEFEATED BECAUSE OF SALT, YOU WILL GO DOWN ANYWAY AND MIKE IS A GOOD POLITICIAN BUT HE IS GETTING SOMETHING FROM HIS STATE. I AM NOT GETTING SOMETHING FOR SOUTH CAROLINA. I'M NOT GETTING A ROAD TO NOWHERE. WE ARE JUST ASKING TO CUT EXPENSES AND GET THIS FINANCIAL HOUSE BACK IN ORDER FOR AMERICA, THAT IS IT AN ROUTE OUT THE WASTE, FRAUD, AND ABUSE IN MEDICAID AND IF YOU ARE AN ABLE AMERICAN I JUST DO NOT WORK, THAT IS A PROBLEM AND WE NEED TO GET THAT OUT. IF YOU ARE AN ILLEGAL ALIEN GETTING A GOVERNMENT PAYCHECK, IT'S A PROBLEM. THAT IS WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. I'M SURE FREEDOM CAUCUS WILL HAVE A MEETING WHEN SHIP AND THE GROUP COMES BACK BUT I HOPE WE CAN GET TOGETHER ON IT AND IF WE CAN'T, WE WILL JUST KEEP WORKING ON IT UNTIL WE HAVE A MEETING OF THE MINDS. IT IS NOT THAT COMPLICATED. WE HAVE A MATH PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY AND WE HAVE RECONCILIATION. IF WE DO NOT HANDLE IT NOW, I DO NOT KNOW WHEN. THIS COULD NEVER BE AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE TO BEGIN TO GET OUR FINANCIAL HOUSE IN ORDER. IF WE PASS THIS BILL, IT WOULD ADD $4 TRILLION TO OUR DEFICIT. I'M THROUGH WITH THAT. > > AND YOU ALSO SIT ON THE HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE. IT IS THE U.S. TREASURY MARKET TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW THAT YOU ARE CORRECT, IS THAT THE BEST ARGUMENT YOU HAVE IN CHANGING THIS LEGISLATION? > > YEAH. IT IS THE REALITY, IT'S NOT AN ARGUMENT, IT IS A REALITY. WE ARE GOING TO WAKE UP ONE DAY AND NOT HAVE A MARKET FOR OUR BONDS AND IF WE DO, IT WILL BE AT A HIGH INTEREST RATE WHICH WILL SINK THE MARKETS. AND BANKS ARE NOW BEGINNING TO SLOW UP BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT WE AS POLITICIANS WILL MAKE THE HARD CHOICES. EVERY DOLLAR IN WASHINGTON HAS AN ADVOCATE FOR BUT WE HAVE TO START SAYING NO. THE CREDITS, SOMEBODY MAKE AN ARGUMENT WHY WINDOW AND SOLAR OUGHT TO GET TAX CREDIT OR WHY AN ELECTRIC CAR SHOULD GET $7,000 TO MAKE A CAR. LET THE PUBLIC DECIDE. IT GOES ON AND ON AND IT IS LIKE 100 DIFFERENT SUBSIDIES THAT OVER THE YEARS, ALL I AM SAYING IS WE CANNOT AFFORD IT AND IT IS BORROWED MONEY AND THE FREEDOM CAUCUS IS TAKING A HARD STAND. IT IS COMMON SENSE. > > BASED ON THIS CONVERSATION, YOU SAY YOU ARE DONE WITH IT, ADDING TO THE DEBT AND DEFICIT SO YOU ARE STILL A NO VOTE? > > I WAS GOING TO VOTE FOR IT REGARDLESS. IF WE HAD NOTHING OUT OF THE MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE I WAS GOING TO VOTE TO GET IT OUT OF RULES, GET IT ON THE FLOOR AND VOTE FOR A RULE, I WAS NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR THE RULE IF WE ARE GOING TO PUT $4 TRILLION A YEAR WHEN WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO MUCH BETTER AND AT LEAST BE DEFICIT NEUTRAL WHICH IS WHAT WE PROMISED. > > SOME CASES THEY HAVE THINGS I LIKE EVEN BETTER. THERE WILL BE SOMETHING. JOHN THUNE AND MIKE [INAUDIBLE] MOVING IT UP TOGETHER. > > PRESIDENT TRUMP YESTERDAY ON CAPITOL HILL ACKNOWLEDGING EVEN IF THE HOUSE PASSES THE TAX AND SPENDING BILL, BIG CHANGES ARE COMING TO THE SENATE'S VERSION OF THE PLAN. THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US ON BALANCE OF POWER. JOINING US NOW WITH HIS PERSPECTIVE, BILL HAGGERTY, REPUBLICAN SENATOR FROM TENNESSEE. WE KNOW BIG CHANGES WILL COME FROM THE SENATE. WHAT IS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO PULL OUT OF THE BILL AND MAY IT BEGINS WITH THIS NEW DEAL ON SALT? > > GOOD TO BE BACK WITH YOU AGAIN AND I THINK YOU KNOW I AM FROM A NO TAX STATE, TENNESSEE, THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT SALT BUT I UNDERSTAND TRUMP'S BROAD INTENT TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER SO WE WILL NEGOTIATE ON THAT AND OTHER POINTS. NOT TO TRIED TO GET AHEAD OF THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NEGOTIATIONS IN THE SENATE. WE MET YESTERDAY WITH SPEAKER CAN'T -- JOHNSON WHO WAS CLEAR HE WANTS TO WORK WITH US. I THINK WE WILL HAVE A GOOD POSITIVE WORKING RELATIONSHIP AND TRY TO FIND A WAY WE ARE DOING THE BEST WE CAN FOR AMERICANS GIVEN THE CONSTRAINTS WE HAVE RIGHT NOW AND GIVEN IMPLEMENTATION CHALLENGES THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH FACES BUT WE ARE ALL MOVING IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND I THINK WE ARE TAKING THE MESSAGE THAT WE HAVE TO MOVE QUICKLY. WE NEED THIS DONE FOR THE MARKET AND FOR THE SAKE OF CERTAINTY AND WE NEED MORE CAPITAL INVESTMENT COMMITMENTS COME UP MORE JOBS, MORE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN SOON SO THE SENSE OF URGENCY IS VERY REAL. > > THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE IS GRAPPLING WITH REPORTERS ON CAPITOL HILL AND SAYS THE HOUSE WILL VOTE TONIGHT OR THURSDAY AND DECIDE IF THE HOUSE DIVERTS TONIGHT AND MUCH WILL DEPEND ON IF THIS GETS OUT OF THE RULES COMMITTEE BUT TO THE POINT YOU WERE JUST MAKING ABOUT FINANCIAL MARKETS NEEDING TO SEE THIS DONE, IS THE MESSAGE FROM FINANCIAL MARKET THAT THEY WANT TO SEE THEM -- IF THE BILL PASSED BECAUSE TREASURY YIELDS SURGED 10 BASIS POINTS IN MARKET STRATEGIST SAY IT'S ALL ABOUT PHYSICAL CONCERN AND THE DEFICIT AND CREDIBILITY OF INVESTMENTS IN U.S. TREASURIES. . THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ELEMENTS AT PLAY. ONE HAS TO DO WITH EXTENDING THE TAX PACKAGE TO CREATE A MORE CERTAIN ENVIRONMENT FOR CAPITAL COMMITMENTS THAT WILL GET MORE EXIT -- ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. THAT WILL BE POSITIVE. THERE IS ALSO FOCUSED ON SPENDING AND ANOTHER ASPECT THAT GETS FAR TOO LITTLE PLAY HIM IT'S NOT JUST CUTTING SPENDING, IT'S CUTTING THE MASSIVE OVERHEAD WE HAVE THAT COMES FROM REGULATION AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES ARE THE INCREMENTAL COST OF BIDEN REGULATIONS AMOUNTS TO ONE POINT $4 TRILLION OF YEAR OF EXTRA COMPLIANCE COST ON AMERICAN BUSINESSES AND WE ARE WORKING TO TURN THAT BACK AND STREAMLINE REGULATIONS AND THAT IMPACT WILL BE VERY REAL AS WELL WHEN IT COMES TO THE BOTTOM LINE IT WILL BE REINVESTED IN THE ECONOMY AND THAT WILL BE VERY POSITIVE, WE NEED TO SEE IT HAPPEN AND I THINK SPEED AND TIMING ARE OF THE ESSENCE HERE. > > WANT TO ASK YOU ABOUT THE FUTURE OF STABLECOIN LEGISLATION WHICH I KNOW YOU WERE DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THIS. WE SEE A LOT OF PUSHBACK FROM SOME OF YOUR COLLEAGUES ON THE DEMOCRATIC SIDE, INCLUDING SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN, WHO SAID THIS ABOUT THE STABLECOIN LEGISLATION THAT PASSED THIS WEEK. > > A STRONG STABLECOIN DEAL IS THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOME. THIS WEEK BILL IS WORSE THAN NO BILL AT ALL. FOR MONTHS, MANY DEMOCRATS PUSHED FOR COMMON ETHICS PROVISIONS IN THE BILL. UNFORTUNATELY, THE FINAL BILL DOES NOTHING, NOTHING, TO REIN IN THE PRESIDENT'S CRYPTO CORRUPTION. THE GENIUS ACT WILL ACCELERATE TRUMP'S CORRUPTION BY SUPERCHARGING THE SIZE OF THE STABLECOIN MARKET. > > SHE IS WARNING OF A FINANCIAL MELTDOWN TRIGGERED BY CRYPTO INSTABILITY. SENATOR HAGGERTY SAYS STABLECOIN GOES DIRECTLY INTO THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. IS SHE WRONG? > > SHE IS WRONG. SHE'S USING A POLITICAL ARGUMENT TO STIR UP CONTROVERSY BECAUSE SHE HAS BEEN FOCUSED ON SIMPLE BANK DIGITAL CURRENCY. SHE'S BEEN OPPOSED SINCE THE BEGINNING AND THOUGHT IT IN THE BANKING COMMITTEE AND AFTER DEBATE SHE WAS ABLE TO HOLD FOUR DEMOCRATS ON HER SIDE BUT FIVE CAME WITH ME. IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE TODAY THE U.S. IS RELYING ON A PAYMENTS SYSTEM THAT WAS DESIGNED IN THE 1970'S AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MODERNIZE AND TAKE US TO THE 21ST CENTURY. THIS WOULD ALLOW US TO MOVE CURRENCY AND PAYMENT INSTANTANEOUSLY AND IT WOULD BE BASED ON THE U.S. DOLLAR THAT WILL EXTEND OUR DOMINANCE AROUND THE WORLD AND STIMULATE DEMAND FOR U.S. TREASURIES WHICH WOULD BE VERY POSITIVE. IT WILL PROTECT CONSUMERS. ETHICS CONCERNS SENATOR WARREN IS RAISING ARE DEALT WITH IN THE CONSTITUTION. THIS IS A DISTRACTION. SHE NEEDS TO FOCUS ON THE CORE AND I THINK SHE JUST DOES NOT LIKE THE DECENTRALIZED NATURE OF IT. IT IS POWERFUL AND SO MANY WANT TO SEE THIS HAPPEN AND BRING OUR PAYMENT SYSTEM INTO THE 21ST CENTURY. > > WE ARE STILL WAITING ON THE FLOOR VOTE FOR FINAL PASSAGE AND WONDERING ABOUT OTHER PIECES OF LEGISLATION THAT COULD END UP ATTACHED TO THE GENIUS ACT. IS THERE A RISK THAT THE CREDIT CARD COMPETITION ACT ATTACHES ITSELF AND RISKS TAINTING THE EFFORT? > > THERE ARE A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS. THIS IS A MAJOR PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS TO SEARCH THROUGH AND MY GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THIS LEGISLATION PASSES AND WE AVOID A SITUATION WHERE IT GETS BOGGED DOWN WITH AMENDMENTS THAT MIGHT BE UNRELATED SO WE ARE GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS NOW TO EVALUATE AND WE HAVE WELL OVER 100 AMENDMENTS TO EVALUATE BUT WE WILL NARROW IT DOWN AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT LEADER FILLON IS NAVIGATING A PROCESS THAT WILL BRING US TO A SUCCESSFUL RESOLUTION BUT WE HAVE HAD MONTHS TO WORK WITH THE BILL AND INCORPORATED INPUT FROM BOTH SIDES AND FROM THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH AND I FEEL GOOD ABOUT WHERE WE ARE. I THINK WE ARE CLOSE TO SEEING IT COME TO CLOSURE. > > SENATOR, GREAT TO HAVE YOU BACK ON BALANCE OF POWER. STEVE SCALISE SAYS THE HOUSE WILL VOTE TONIGHT ON BUDGET RECONCILIATION AND IN THAT VOTE IT IS EXPECTED TO BE ALL DEMOCRATIC NO AND WE HAVE A QUESTION OF HOW MANY REPUBLICAN KNOWS -- NOES. UP NEXT, TRUMP REPEATS UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS. DETAILS NEXT ON BALANCE OF POWER. > > WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR YOU TO BE CONVINCED THERE IS NO GENOCIDE IN SOUTH AFRICA? > > I CAN ANSWER THAT. IT WILL TAKE PRESIDENT TRUMP LISTENING TO THE VOICES OF SOUTH AFRICANS, SOME OF WHOM ARE GOOD FRIENDS. > > I DO ALLOW THEM. THEY TAKE THE LAND. THEY KILL THE WHITE FARMER. AND WHEN THEY KILL THE WHITE FARMER, NOTHING HAPPENS TO THEM. > > IN MANY WAYS, ONE SHOULD SAY, YOU ARE A PARTNER OF SOUTH AFRICA AND YOU ARE RAISING CONCERNS, AND THESE ARE CONCERNS THAT I AM WILLING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT. > > THAT WAS TRUMP IN THE OVAL OFFICE TODAY ALONGSIDE SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT, MONTHS OF HEATED RHETORIC'S BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT LET UP TO TODAY'S TENSE MEETING AND JOINING US FOR MORE, OUR CORRESPONDENT WHO HELPS LEAD WHITE HOUSE COVERAGE. THE PRESIDENT CAME PREPARED. HE PRINTED OUT NEWS ARTICLES ABOUT THE DEATH OF WHITE SOUTH AFRICANS, HE HAD A VIDEO MONTAGE PLAYING ON THE SCREEN. WAS THIS BY DESIGN? > > I THINK SO. THE FACT THAT THEY HAD THIS MATERIAL READY. THE SOUTH AFRICAN DELEGATION CERTAINLY FELT SO. FOR THE PRESIDENT, THIS IS A CLASSIC DEMONSTRATION OF BRUTE POWER, SEIZING THE BULLY PULPIT TO MAKE A POINT. YOU CAN ARGUE IF THAT IS GOOD. ON ONE HAND, HE GOT HIS CASE ACROSS. HE HIGHLIGHTED IT IN A VERY PUBLIC WAY THAT WAS BROADCAST AROUND THE WORLD. ON THE OTHER, THIS IS NOW ONE OF MULTIPLE INSTANCES IN THE OVAL OFFICE, HE HAD ZELENSKYY, JUSTIN TRUDEAU THAT TRUMP WAS: GOVERNOR, WHERE FOREIGN LEADERS ARE COMING TO EXCHANGE DIPLOMATIC VIEWS AND IT TURNS INTO THIS MAJOR CONFLICT. > > TRUMP SAID EARLIER THE MOST EXCITING ROOM IN THE WORLD IS THE OVAL OFFICE. IF THIS TRUMP SHOW CONTINUES, ARE WE IN A SITUATION WHERE WORLD LEADERS WILL NO LONGER WALK INTO THE OVAL OFFICE? > > THAT'S QUESTION DEMOCRATS ARE ASKING TODAY FOR SURE. FOREIGN LEASH -- THEY ARE SAYING THIS WILL PUSH SOUTH AFRICA CLOSER TO CHINA. AT THE SAME TIME I THINK WHAT TRUMP IS SAYING IS THAT THE U.S. HAS BEEN TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF ON THE WORLD STAGE. THEY UNDERPINNED THE SECURITY AND TRADE SYSTEM EVERYONE IN THE WORLD HAS BENEFITED FROM EXCEPT HE WOULD ARGUE MANY AMERICANS AND SO THIS IS HIS CHANCE TO MAKE THAT CASE PUBLICLY. > > COMPLETE WITH VIDEO PRESENTATION. WE HAVE NOT SEEN SOMETHING QUITE LIKE THAT IN THE OVAL OFFICE. > > POWERPOINT. IT MAY BE BLOOMBERG TERMINAL. [LAUGHTER] > > NEW OPTICS. GREAT TO DISCUSS WITH JUSTIN SINK HELPING US COVER THE WHITE HOUSE EVERY DAY, COME BACK SOON. COMING UP, HOW DEMOCRATS ARE STRATEGIZING HOW -- AS THE PACKAGE MOVES CLOSER TO THE HOUSE FLOOR. WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT WITH SARAH ELLSWORTH OF MARYLAND NEXT ON BALANCE OF POWER. > > THIS IS BALANCE OF POWER. I'M JOE MATHIEU. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. WATCHING CAPITOL HILL FOR SOME TIME THIS EVENING AS MIKE JOHNSON CONTINUES THE PUSH TO UNIFY HIS CAUCUS TO PUT THE ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL ON THE FLOOR FOR A VOTE. HE TOLD VOTERS A SHORT TIME AGO THAT HE IS CONFIDENT THE TAX BILL WILL BE PASSED BY MEMORIAL DAY. STEVE SCALISE SAYS THE PLAN IS TO VOTE IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND FLOOR TONIGHT. THE RULES COMMITTEE IS HANDLING THE LEGISLATION NOW WITH A HEARING THAT HAS GONE ON SINCE 1:00 A.M. AND JOINING US WITH THE LATEST IS MEGAN SCULLY, WE ARE NOT SERIOUS ABOUT A FLOOR VOTE TONIGHT, ARE WE? > > THAT IS WHAT THE MAJORITY LEADER IS SAYING TONIGHT, AND HE CONTROLS THE FLOOR. IT COULD BE PART OF A PRESSURE CAMPAIGN BUT WE HAVE SEEN VOTES, BILLS COME TO THE FLOOR AND FAIL UNDER THE SPEAKERSHIP OF MIKE JOHNSON. HE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE AFRAID OF FAILING VERY PUBLICLY. WE HAVE SEEN THIS IN A NUMBER OF INSTANCES, INCLUDING ON THE BUDGET SO IT IS NOT ANYTHING WE WOULD HAVE SEEN FROM NANCY PELOSI, FOR INSTANCE, BUT IT HAS ALLOWED JOHNSON TO SUCCEED IN THE CAUCUS, ODDLY ENOUGH, AND SMOKE OUT THE OPPOSITION AND GET TO THE ROOT OF THE ISSUE. THE PROBLEM HERE IS THERE ARE SO MANY ISSUES. IT'S LIKE PLAYING WHACK-A-MOLE. ONCE YOU SOLVE ONE, ANOTHER ONE POPS UP. HE SOLVED SALT, IT SEEMS AND MADE THE FREEDOM CAUCUS MAD AND THAT IS WHY SOME HOLDOUTS WERE MEETING WITH TRUMP AT THE WHITE HOUSE THIS AFTERNOON DO WE HAVE A SENSE IF THE PRESIDENT WAS ABLE TO CONVINCE [INDISCERNIBLE] > > THE WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY SAID IT WAS A PRODUCTIVE MEETING. JOHNSON SAID AS MUCH WHEN HE CAME BACK. WE ARE WAITING TO HEAR FROM THE HOLDOUTS WHAT THEY SAY, HOW THEY WOULD CHARACTERIZE THE MEETING. YOU GUYS HAD ON RALPH NORMAN AND HE WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE WHITE HOUSE MEETING BUT REMAINS IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AND IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES, CONGRESSMAN JOHN ROSE FROM TENNESSEE, SOMEONE NO ONE HAD THEIR EYES ON, CAME OUT IN A OF THE BILL OVER THE SALT DEDUCTION. > > MEGAN SCULLY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. WE WILL CONTINUE TO COVER THIS THIS EVENING AND FOR MORE ON HOW DEMOCRATS ARE RESPONDING WE GO TO CAPITOL HILL TO SPEAK WITH DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN SARAH ELFRED OF MARYLAND SPARED NO ONE -- NONE OF US CAN KNOW IF YOU WILL VOTE TONIGHT OR WHAT THE OUTCOME WILL BE BUT THE ARGUMENT REPUBLICANS MAKE IS IF IT DOES NOT ULTIMATELY PASS, AMERICANS WILL FACE A MASSIVE TAX HEIGHT. -- HIKE. WHAT IS WORSE, HITTING WALLETS OR CONSIDERING WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THOSE WHO MIGHT BE RELIANT ON MEDICAID BENEFITS AND COULD FACE CUTS FROM THIS LEGISLATION? > > THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. I AM PREPARED TO SLEEP ON MY OFFICE COUCH TONIGHT IF I NEED TO IF THAT IS WHAT IS NEEDED TO VOTE NO ON THIS TERRIBLE BILL. IT'S A CHALLENGE TO BUILD A COALITION AND GOVERNMENT IS HARD BUT I CANNOT VOTE FOR ANYTHING THAT WOULD CUT HEALTH COVERAGE FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS IN MY DISTRICT, NOT JUST FOR MEDICAID AS WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT MONTHS BUT WE JUST LEARNED A FEW HOURS AGO CBO HAS SCORED WHAT THEY BELIEVE THE BILL COULD BE AND IT SHOWS THE SAME BILL WILL TRIGGER A $500 BILLION CUT TO MEDICARE. SO I AM A HARD NO. > > YOU ARE ALSO INTRODUCING TWO AMENDMENTS TO THE RULES COMMITTEE THAT HAS BEEN IN HEARING SINCE 1:00 A.M. AND YOU ARE SLATED TO BE ON A PANEL LATER TODAY AND THESE TWO AMENDMENTS, ONE ON MILITARY READINESS, IS THAT AN EFFORT TO SLOW THE PROCESS AND HAVE A CONVERSATION OR TO CHANGE THE CONTENTS OF THE BILL? > > I AM INTRODUCING MY AMENDMENTS AND IN ALL SERIOUSNESS THEY ARE AMENDMENTS I INTRODUCED IN THE COMMITTEES IN WHICH I SERVED BUT THIS IS A DISCUSSION ABOUT POLICY AND THIS BILL PROPOSES $150 BILLION INCREASE TO MILITARY SPENDING AND MANY PRIORITIES I SHARE BUT I DO NOT TRUST SECRETARY HEGSETH WITH 100 $50, LET ALONE 150 BILLION AND IT DOES NOT ADDRESS READIES -- READINESS ISSUES THAT CONCERN ME WHICH IS WHY I AM SUBMITTING THESE AMENDMENTS TO THE RULES COMMITTEE IN ABOUT AN HOUR. > > CONSIDERING THE LEADERSHIP OF THE PENTAGON WE LEARNED OFFICIALLY FROM THE U.S. DEFENSE DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO ACCEPT THE $400 MILLION JET DEBT -- FROM QATAR TO USE AS AIR FORCE ONE. IS THE PENTAGON PREPARED TO QUICKLY CONVERT IT TO THE KIND OF AIRCRAFT IT NEEDS TO BE AND BE TRUSTED TO TRANSPORT THE PRESIDENT? > > I DO NOT BELIEVE SO. IT'S A GIANT FLYING BUG. I DO NOT CARE IF WE GET IT FOR FREE. IT PRESENTS REAL NATIONAL SECURITY THREATS. I AM TRAVELING ABROAD AND THE SECURITY QUESTIONS I TAKE JUST AS A MEMBER OF CONGRESS ARE VERY SERIOUS. I DO NOT ENVISION A WORLD IN WHICH THAT AIRPLANE CAN BE SAFE TO CARRY OUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF SO I AM GRAVELY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS GIFT. > > YOU MENTIONED THE DEFENSE BUDGET. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE FIRST-EVER TRILLION DOLLAR BUDGET FOR THE PENTAGON. THE FACT THAT YOU WILL HAVE THE NAVAL ECONOMY IN YOUR DISTRICT, I KNOW YOU ARE VERY CLOSE TO THIS. THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE SAYS IT'S NOT ENOUGH MONEY TO BUILD THE MILITARY CAPABILITY WE NEED, THINKING ABOUT THE GOLDEN DOME, F 87, UNMANNED TECHNOLOGY, SHIPBUILDING. DOES HE HAVE A POINT? > > I SHARE HIS CONCERNS ABOUT OUR READINESS, PARTICULARLY AS WE LEARN EVERY DAY ABOUT THE NEW THREATS OF OUR ADVERSARIES AND CAPABILITIES OF RUSSIA, CHINA, AND IRAN. IT WOULD MAKE ANYBODY HYPER VILLAGE AND -- HYPERVIGILANT. I ENJOY THE COMMITTEE BECAUSE WE HAVE SERIOUS BIPARTISAN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW TO PREPARE OUR MILITARY TO BE THE BEST IN THE WORLD. > > HOW MUCH MONEY DOES THE PENTAGON NEED? > > I DO NOT HAVE A NUMBER BUT I HAVE DEEP RESERVATIONS WITH THIS THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE TO BE ABLE TO SPEND EFFECTIVELY AND I THINK MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE WOULD AGREE WITH ME. WITH THE UNPRECEDENTED CONTINUING RESOLUTION CONGRESS JUST PASSED, WE ARE DIMINISHING OUR OVERSIGHT CAPACITY IN DEFENSE AND THAT IS GRAVELY CONCERNING. > > ONE AREA THE PRESIDENT WOULD LIKE TO SEE DEFENSE MONEY ROUTED IS TO THE GOLDEN DOME THAT HE ANNOUNCED WITH HEGSETH YESTERDAY SUGGESTING IT WOULD COST LESS THAN TWO $100 BILLION HE THINKS IT CAN BE DONE IN THREE YEARS. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT, DO YOU THINK IT'S NECESSARY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY? > > SECRETARY HEGSETH HAS NOT BROUGHT HIMSELF IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE YET AND THEY HAVE NOT SOLD THEIR PARTNERS IN CONGRESS ON THE PLAN. I HAVE NO IDEA OF DETAILS BEYOND WHAT WAS REPORTED TODAY BUT WE NEED TO DO THIS IN PARTNERSHIP GEARED WE ARE A COEQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. THE MOST CONCERNING THING ABOUT THIS PLACE SO FAR IS CONGRESS HAS DIMINISHED RESPONSIBILITY. WITH REPUBLICANS IN CHARGE, WE HAVE ROLLED BACK OUR BUDGETING, APPROPRIATIONS RESPONSIBILITY TO BE THE CHECK AND BALANCE ON THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH SO I CANNOT APPROVE OR DISAPPROVE OF ANYTHING THAT THE SECRETARY AND THIS ADMINISTRATION HAVE NOT BROUGHT TO THEIR PARTNERS IN CONGRESS FOR A RESPONSIBLE CONVERSATION. > > YOU MAKE AN IMPORTANT POINT. AS ONE OF THE NEWEST PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING, THIS IS YOUR FIRST RECONCILIATION PROCESS. IS IT GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY? > > I WOULD SUGGEST IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE A HEARING ON RULES AS THAT STARTS IN THE DARK OF THE NIGHT, IT IS NOT HEALTHY FOR OUR REPUBLIC OR PUBLIC DISCOURSE OR HEALTHY TO MAKE SURE OUR CONSTITUENTS CAN CALL OUR OFFICES AND SHARE THEIR OPINIONS AND THEY PROVIDE A MUCH-NEEDED CHECK ON US THAT OUR FRAMERS INTENDED. THE FACT THAT WE DO NOT EVEN HAVE THE FINAL AMENDMENT YET WITH THE SPEAKER WANTS TO BRING THE BILL TO THE FLOOR TONIGHT, RIDICULOUS. > > WE WILL BE WATCHING FOR YOU LATER ON. CONGRESSWOMAN, THANK YOU FOR JOINING OUR CONVERSATION PEERED DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE NEWS, THE DOJ MOVED -- ANNOUNCED IT WILL MOVE TO DISMISS THE BIDEN ERA ACCOUNTABILITY AGREEMENTS WITH POLICE DEPARTMENTS IN LOUISVILLE AND MINNEAPOLIS. > > THIS IS OVER THE KILLINGS OF GEORGE FLOYD AND BREONNA TAYLOR. THE DEPARTMENT WILL CLOSE INVESTIGATIONS INTO POLICE DEPARTMENTS OF FINA, TRENTON, MEMPHIS, OKLAHOMA CITY, AND MORE. > > THEY ARE SHIFTING AWAY FROM RACIAL DISCRIMINATION CASES, SAYING INVESTIGATIONS AND LAWSUITS WERE PART OF AN ANTI-POLICE AGENDA AND THIS COMES DAYS BEFORE MINNEAPOLIS MARKS FIVE YEARS SINCE GEORGE FLOYD SCALING. COMING UP, -- GEORGE FLOYD'S KILLING. COMING, OUR POLITICAL PANEL. > > THE TAX CUT PLAN IS GOING TO BE PUT OUT. AS LONG AS WE ARE GOING TO GET THE TAX CUTS IN THE BILL I THINK WILL PASS WHETHER WE GET WHAT WE NEED, THE BILL WILL PASS RULES COMMITTEE. THE QUESTION IS IF IT WILL PASS ON THE FLOOR AND IT DOES NOT HAVE THE SUPPORT TO PASS ON THE FLOOR. > > RALPH NORMAN SHARING WHETHER HE BELIEVES THE TAX PASSIVE WILL PASS ON THE FLOOR WHEN HE SPOKE WITH US EARLIER TODAY. STEVE SCULLY SAYS THE VOTE WILL BE TONIGHT DESPITE RULES COMMITTEE STILL UNDERWAY AS YOU SEE AFTER OVER 16 HOURS. JOINING US WITH REACTION IS OUR POLITICAL PANEL, MEGAN HAYES AND LAUREN TOMLINSON. GREAT TO SEE YOU BOTH. THIS IS HAPPENING BEFORE OUR EYES. WHAT IS STEVE SCALISE THINKING THAT THIS COULD REACH A FLOOR VOTE TONIGHT? THEY HAVE A LOT OF HOLDOUTS. > > APPARENTLY THE WHITE HOUSE MEETING WENT WELL. THE WHITE HOUSE PRESENTED A LIST OF OPTIONS THAT THEY WOULD BE COMFORTABLE WITH TO GIVE BASICALLY LEADERSHIP IN HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS AND DISSENTERS SPACE TO WORK OUT A DEAL. REPUBLICANS WANT THIS BILL PASSED BECAUSE THEY WANT TRUMP'S 2817 TAX CUTS EXTENDED BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT IS TAX INCREASE AND YOU DO NOT WANT THAT UNDER TRUMP'S WATCH BECAUSE HE CAMPAIGNED ON LOWERING TAXES FOR PEOPLE. IT WILL GET DONE IN SOME FORM BECAUSE REPUBLICANS ARE COMMITTED TO GETTING IT DONE AND NOT LETTING TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN PROMISE GO TO WASTE. THE MINUTIA IS YET TO BE SEEN. MAYBE IT WILL BE LIKE SPEAKER VOTES AND THEY WILL HOLD THEM THERE AND KEEP RUNNING THE VOTES? > > AND IT REQUIRED TRUMP GETTING ON THE PHONE WITH MEMBERS TO SAY YOU HAVE TO VOTE FOR MIKE JOHNSON AND NOW WE HAVE SEEN TRUMP YESTERDAY ON CAPITOL HILL AND TODAY HAVING HOLDOUTS AT THE WHITE HOUSE, HE IS HEAVILY INVOLVED. IS FAILURE OR PASSAGE OF THE BILL COMPLETELY TIED TO HIS ARGUMENT ON THE HOLD HE HAS ON REPUBLICAN PARTY? > > ABSOLUTELY. YOU SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE BENDING TO TRUMP INSTEAD OF BENDING TO CONSTITUENTS. AND BESIDES THE POLICIES THAT ARE BAD FOR AMERICANS LIKE KICKING 14 MILLION PEOPLE OFF MEDICAID, THEY ARE MAKING HOUSE REPUBLICANS TAKE A VOTE ON SOMETHING THAT WILL GET GUTTED IN THE SENATE AND IT WILL NOT BE THE SAME BILL WHEN THEY GET IT BACK AND THEY ARE IN DANGER OF LOSING THE MAJORITY OF THE SENATE. DEMOCRATS WILL USE THIS AGAINST THEM EVERY STEP OF THE WAY SO I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE TACTIC OF WHY THEY ARE MAKING THEM VOTE ON THIS. > > DEMOCRATS WILL MAKE A LOT OF ADS ABOUT MEDICARE. IS THAT A CONCERN CONSIDERING THAT TYRANTS -- CONSIDERING MIDTERMS? > > NOT SO MUCH. THEY WILL RUN ADS ABOUT HOW DEMOCRATS LIED AND CONTRAST OF MEDICAID AND MEDICARE CUTS FOCUS IN ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS AND INCREASING WORK REQUIREMENTS, THINGS GENERALLY POPULAR. SO I THINK YES THERE WILL BE ADS AND NOBODY LIKES HEALTH CARE BEING TOUCHED AND ENTITLEMENT SPENDING BUT REPUBLICANS HAVE BIG CONTEST MESSAGING SO IF YOU MAKE IT AGAINST AMERICANS AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS ACCESSING WELFARE, IT'S A HARD CONTRAST. > > BUT THEY ARE NOT ENTITLED TO GET MEDICAID COME LEGALLY, EXCEPT IN EMERGENCY SCENARIOS. THAT'S A VERY SMALL FRACTION OF THE BUDGET. THE MEASURES THAT THEY SAY THEY WANT IN TERMS OF SUBSTITUTE CHANGES, WILL THEY BE THINGS THAT DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE DEFICIT? > > NO. WHEN I WORKED IN THE SENATE AND THEY PUT FORTH A RESPONSIBLE BIPARTISAN SPENDING AND CUTS PLAN THAT WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY REDUCED THE DEBT AND DEFICIT WOULD HAVE BALANCED THE BUDGET AND IT REQUIRED NO TAX CUTS AND REQUIRED ENTITLEMENT REFORM, ACTUAL ENTITLEMENT REFORM AND DRASTIC SPENDING CUTS TO DEFENSE TO EVERYTHING. BASICALLY THEY DID NOT LEAVE ANYTHING UNTOUCHED. IT MADE EVERYBODY HURT AND THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE WILL TRULY FIX THIS, IS IF DEMOCRATS HAVE AS MUCH TO LOSE AS REPUBLICANS IN EVERY ASPECT AND NOBODY GETS WHAT THEY WANT, IT SOLVES THE BUDGET. > > DURING CAMPAIGN REPUBLICANS TALKED A LOT ABOUT OVERSPENDING THEY SAW IN THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION, DEBT AND DEFICITS MATTER. I AM NOT SURE WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THE ELECTION BUT DO DEMOCRATS ON THE ISSUE NOW? > > I DO NOT THINK SO. WHEN YOU PUT FORTH A BUDGET THAT HAS 3 TRILLION ADDED TO THE DEFICIT AND YOU OWN ALL THE POWER IN THE SENATE, HOUSE AND WHITE HOUSE I DO NOT KNOW HOW YOU CAN PUT THAT BACK ON THE DEMOCRATS. THEY ARE MAKING TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHIEST 5% WHICH WILL INCREASE COSTS FOR THE LOWER 40% IN THE COUNTRY IN THE BATTLEGROUND STATES AND THE POLITICS IS NOT ADDING UP TO THEM, THEY ARE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING FOR TRUMP AND HIS FRIENDS AND BILLIONAIRE COLLEAGUES THAT IS NOT BENEFIT FOR THE WORKING CLASS. > > TRUMP SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME TODAY FOCUSED ON THIS ISSUE AND HE ALSO SPENT HOURS WITH THE PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICA WHO VISITED HIM IN THE OVAL OFFICE IN WHICH THE PRESIDENT ACTUALLY SHOWED A VIDEO OF WHAT HE SAID IS PROOF OF PERSECUTION OF WHITE FARMERS IN SOUTH AFRICA AND BROUGHT PRINT OUTS. HE WAS ASKED HOW HE CAN CONVINCE DONALD TRUMP THAT GENOCIDE IS NOT HAPPENING IN HIS COUNTRY AND THIS IS WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. > > IT WILL TAKE PRESIDENT TRUMP LISTENING TO THE VOICES OF SOUTH AFRICANS, SOME OF WHOM ARE HIS GOOD FRIENDS, LIKE THOSE WHO ARE HERE. WHEN WE HAVE TALKS, IT WOULD TAKE PRESIDENT TRUMP TO LISTEN. > > MEGAN, YOU SPENT TIME IN THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE HELPING MESSAGING AND THINKING ABOUT THINGS LIKE THIS. WHAT DID YOU SEE ORCHESTRATED IN THE OVAL TODAY? > > I HAVE SEEN THESE CONVERSATIONS AND A LOT GOES BEHIND THE SCENES. THEY HAVE A CONVERSATION IN PRIVATE AS WELL AND SOME OF THESE CONVERSATIONS HE IS CHOOSING TO DO IN PUBLIC BECAUSE IT'S A REALITY SHOW FOR HIM LIKE INSULTING ZELENSKYY AND THIS CONVERSATION, THIS IS JUST ADDING AMERICA IS NOT DOING IN A DIPLOMATIC WAY HERE THERE IS CLEARLY MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE. THERE WERE REPORTS ELON MUSK IS HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING STARLINK PURCHASES AND SO THERE IS MORE TO THIS THAT PROBABLY BENEFITS PEOPLE IN HIS ADMINISTRATION BUT I THINK THIS IS NOT REPRESENTING THE WAY WE WANT TO REPRESENT OUR COUNTRY AND THE DIPLOMATIC PROCESS IS BROKEN AND IT IS EMBARRASSING THAT THEY ARE USING THE OVAL OFFICE LIKE THIS IN PUBLIC. > > IT CERTAINLY PLAYS WELL WITH THE MAGA CROWD. IS THE MODEL BROKEN AFTER WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AS WHAT IS BEING DESCRIBED AS AN AMBUSH? WHY WOULD ANY GLOBAL LEADER WALKED INTO THE OVAL OFFICE? > > TO YOUR POINT, HIS BUDDIES -- HIS BASE LIKES THIS, THEY DO NOT WANT TO SEE THE POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE WE HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO SEEING IN DIPLOMATIC CONVERSATIONS. > > BUT ISN'T THIS TRUMP VERSION OF POMP AND CIRCUMSTANCE? IT IS THE TRUMP SHOW. > > YES BUT HE IS CHALLENGING WORLD LEADERS AND IN HIS WORLD, THE MAGA WORLD IT MEANS NOT LETTING ALL OF THESE FOREIGN LEADERS COME IN AND DEMAND. I'M NOT SAYING THAT IS WHAT IS HAPPENING IN SOUTH AFRICA BUT AN UNDERCURRENT OF GRASSROOTS REPUBLICANISM REALLY WANTS TO SEE AMERICA MAKE OTHER COUNTRIES STEP UP AND ADDRESS ISSUES. AND THERE IS THE QUESTION OF WHITE AFRIKANERS THAT THE U.S. IS ACCEPTING AS REFUGEES. THE WHITE HOUSE VIEWS ITS ARGUMENTS AS BEING WINNING. DO YOU SEE THIS AS WAITING FOR THEM WHEN WE ARE NOT ACCEPTING AFRICANS WHO WORKED WITH US DURING THE WAR AS REFUGEES RIGHT NOW? > > I'M NOT SURE BUT REVISITING OF WHO WE ARE GIVING VISA'S TWO IS A WINNING MESSAGE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE WE ARE SHIFT FROM A HEAVY ASYLUM SYSTEM, NOT VETTING AND CHOOSING WHO IS COMING AND MOVING TOWARDS A MORE NORMALIZED WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES DO PUTTING THEM THROUGH A REFUGEE PROCESS, THEY SEE THAT TYPE OF SHIFT AND IMMIGRATION POLICY AS A WINNING ISSUE WHICH MEANS THEY CAN FOCUS ON GIVING VISAS TO PEOPLE THEY BELIEVE ARE GOING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ECONOMY INSTEAD OF JUST THE FLOOD WE SEE OF PEOPLE ABUSING THE SYSTEM. > > TIM KAINE, DEMOCRATIC SENATOR FROM VIRGINIA ASKED MARCO RUBIO IF AFRIKANER FARMERS ARE THE MOST PERSECUTED PEOPLE IN THE WORLD. ARE WE GETTING AN ANSWER? > > I DO NOT THINK SO WHEN I DO NOT THINK MOST PEOPLE UNDERSTAND OR ARE PAYING ATTENTION. WILL WORLD LEADERS COME TO THE OVERALL, I THINK THE ANSWER IS NO, THEY WILL GO TO OTHER COUNTRIES FOR THE SUPPORT THAT THE U.S. WAS GIVING THEM, SO WHERE AMERICANS ARE NOT PAYING ATTENTION, THEY SHOULD BECAUSE WE ARE PUSHING OTHER PEOPLE AWAY FROM US IN -- PUSHING OTHER COUNTRIES AWAY FROM US. THEY NEED TO PAY ATTENTION. > > THIS IS BALANCE OF HER ON BLOOMBERG TV AND RADIO. IT IS NEARLY 6:00 P.M. EAST COAST AND HOUSE RULES COMMITTEE IS ABOUT TO GO INTO ITS 17TH HOUR CONSIDERING THE MASSIVE BUDGET RECONCILIATION BILL. HOUSE LEADERSHIP STILL SAYS A FLOOR VOTE ON LEGISLATION COULD HAPPEN TONIGHT BUT A FEW THINGS NEED TO HAPPEN FIRST. WHATEVER CHANGES THE SPEAKER HAS AGREED TO WITH VARIOUS FACTIONS AND IT STILL HAS TO GO THROUGH RULES. > > PEOPLE ARE DOZING OFF AFTER ALL THIS TIME. THERE ARE GREAT CONCERNS. WE TALKED WITH RALPH NORMAN AND HE IS NOT PREPARED TO VOTE YES AS HE MADE CLEAR, AT LEAST ON THE FLOOR. AND THERE ARE MANY OTHERS WHERE HE CAME FROM. WE WILL KEEP TABS ON THIS AND INVITE YOU TO CHECK OUT THE WASHINGTON EDITION NEWSLETTER. THERE IS A LOT TO CATCH UP ON ON THE TERMINAL AND ONLINE. WE WILL TACKLE THIS TOMORROW WHEN WE GET BACK TOGETHER. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US ON BALANCE OF POWER.",

  "summary": "House Republicans are working to get President Donald Trump's BILLeded to the final line with a potential vote, but this cannot happen until he gets out of the RulES COMMITTEE. The Freedom Caucus has threatened to tank the bill, citing a meeting with lawmakers from the CONSERVATIVE FREEDOM CAUCUS at the White House and a lack of support for the Salt BILL. The group is also questioning the $16 BILLION TREASURY AUCTION's demand and the potential impact on state budgets. The real issue is environmental concerns over the Green Energy Tax Credits, which are being pushed back due to ongoing initiatives that could impact companies that already invested in renewable energy projects. TENNESSEE Senator Bill HAGGERTY and REPUBLICAN CONGRESSman and member of the House Freedom Caucus discuss the implications of the bill passing the House.",
