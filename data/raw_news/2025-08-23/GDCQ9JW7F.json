  "description": "Dylan Edwards is out for the remainder of Kansas State's Week 0 game against Iowa State on Saturday, Aug. 23, with an apparent ankle injury.",
  "content": "Kansas State football running back Dylan Edwards will miss the rest of the Wildcats' game against Iowa State on Saturday, Aug. 23 with an apparent ankle injury.\n\nEdwards, K-State's starting running back, left the Aer Lingus College Football Classic in Dublin, Ireland, early in the first quarter after appearing to injure his ankle after receiving a punt. Wildcats coach Chris Klieman told the ESPN broadcast at halftime that Edwards will miss the remainder of the game.\n\nLosing the second-year transfer from Colorado is a big blow for K-State, as the 5-foot-9 speedster had 546 rushing yards with five touchdowns last season behind now-Indianapolis Colts running back DJ Giddens. He also provides quarterback Avery Johnson with a strong option in the passing game.\n\nEdwards had a standout freshman season at Colorado, scoring four touchdowns in the Buffaloes' 2023 season opener against TCU.\n\nHere's what to know of Edwards' injury against the Cyclones on Aug. 23.\n\nEdwards only played one snap and didn't see the field on offense before exiting the game against Iowa State, as he muffed a punt that led to an apparent ankle injury. His ankle was taped on the sideline before he exited the field to the locker room.\n\nEdwards later returned to the sideline, although it was without his helmet and with a towel over his head. He didn't appear the rest of the first half before Klieman confirmed he will miss the remainder of the game.\n\nIt's unclear the severity of Edwards' injury, although it's certainly a big blow to Kansas State's offense in the top-25 Big 12 matchup.",

      "text": "Kansas State football vs. Iowa State live updates: Wildcats, Cyclones in close game late\nChris Klieman and the Kansas State Wildcats open the 2025 football season in Ireland with the Aer Lingus College Football Classic against Iowa State at Aviva Stadium. A Week 0 showdown, the game will reverberate throughout the Big 12 regardless of the result, as quarterback Avery Johnson looks to leave his mark in Manhattan.\nIt will be the second time in their past three games the Wildcats have faced the Cyclones, having lost to Iowa State in the final game of the regular season last year. The Cyclones are led by quarterback Rocco Becht, who is hoping to build on a strong 2024 campaign.\nStream Kansas State vs Iowa State on Fubo (free trial)\nThe Topeka Capital-Journal is bringing you live updates, scores and highlights from the game.\nKansas State vs Iowa State live score\nThis section will be updated near kickoff.\n| TEAMS | 1Q | 2Q | 3Q | 4Q | F |\n| Iowa State | 7 | 0 | 7 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| Kansas State | 0 | 7 | 0 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\nFourth quarter: Iowa State 17, Kansas State 14.\nIowa State retakes lead with field goal\nThe Cyclones retake the lead with a 34-yard field goal from Konrady, who is now 1-of-2 on the day kicking. Iowa State answers, but Kansas State will get the ball back with a chance to take its first lead of the game.\nKansas State responds in a big way\nThat was Avery Johnson's best series of the game, and frankly one of the best of his K-State career.\nOn multiple dropbacks, Johnson completes 4 of 5 passes for 85 yards and caps it off with a touchdown to Jayce Brown just two plays after nearly connecting with Brown from 44 yards. Huge answer for the Wildcats, and it's 14-14 late.\nThird quarter: Iowa State 14, Kansas State 7\nThird quarter ends with big play for Kansas State\nThe Kansas State offense has looked at its best when answering an Iowa State score. First Johnson threads the needle with a 17-yard completion to Jayce Brown, then he climbs the pocket and finds a wide open Oakley for 24 yards down to the Iowa State 44-yard line. Now, Kansas State will try to make the most of yet another trip into ISU territory.\nIowa State retakes the lead\nBecht throws his second TD pass of the game with a dime to Brett Eskilsden. Eskilden's second catch of the day goes for 24 yards and a touchdown, and Iowa State is back on top.\nIowa State moving the ball again\nFollowing the turnover on downs, Iowa State is pushing the ball on the ground. The Cyclones are in the midst of a 10-play drive for 46 yards that has taken 5:43 off the clock. A fourth-down conversion kept the drive alive.\nKansas State offense sputters\nNot a great look for offensive coordinator Matt Wells. After Johnson complete a few plays, a QB draw and reverse put Kansas State in the hole on third down. A throw at the line of scrimmage puts Kansas State in fourth-and-8, and a dropped pass leads to a turnover on downs. Chris Klieman is calling this game aggressively, but the playcalling isn't matching his pace.\nIowa State punts it away after three-and-out\nSame situation for Iowa State. Nothing to be found, with a huge Kansas State sack halting the Cyclones' ensuing drive in its tracks.\nWildcats go three-and-out\nSo much for mometum.\nKansas State goes three-and-out despite getting itself in a favorable third-and-2 situation. An Avery Johnson pass at the line of scrimmage gets blown up, and Iowa State will start from its own 42-yard line.\nKansas State receives to start second half\nKansas State will start the second half with the ball, and returns it to the 19-yard line. The offense will try to find momentum early.\nHalftime: Kansas State 7, Iowa State 7\nIt feels like Week 0.\nKansas State and Iowa State's offenses have both had ample scoring opportunities, but both sides have just one touchdown to their respective names. Iowa State struck first on a gorgeous throw from Rocco Becht, while Avery Johnson ran in a touchdown on a tremendous keeper read.\nDylan Edwards is out for the game for Kansas State, and Joe Jackson will get the lion's share of carries from there on out. The Wildcats have moved the ball fairly well on the ground, but the turnover bug is proving to be a serious issue as drives continue. Iowa State's ground game, meanwhile, has just 23 yards to its name thus far.\nBoth coaches will look to clean things up in the second half, but in a Week 0 game on a damp field, this one might come down to survival and ball security more than anything else.\nSecond quarter: Kansas State 7, Iowa State 7\nKansas State drive sputters out\nKansas State looked like it was starting to move the ball, but a pass interference call and airmailed throw from Johnson lead to a punt. Iowa State fields the punt at its own 4-yard line, and both teams just look ready to get to the locker room.\nCyclones miss 49-yard field goal\nIt's another empty turnover for Iowa State. The Cyclones miss a 49-yard field goal attempt after failing to convert on third down, ad Kansas State gets the ball back from its own 31-yard line.\nIowa State driving after turnover\nAlthough both teams have squandered turnovers deep in opposing territory, Iowa State is threatening after the Jackson fumble. The Cyclones have converted a fourth down to keep this drive alive, and Iowa State faces third-and-9 from the Kansas State 31-yard line.\nJoe Jackson fumbles away K-State possession\nThe Wildcats were moving the ball well with a big completion to Garrett Oakley, but Jackson fumbles it away after a big gain up the middle. That's now four fumbles lost between these two teams... In the first half.\nKansas State forces yet another Iowa State punt\nNo momentum shift after the turnover on downs, as the Wildcats force another Iowa State three-and-out. Wildcats will start on their own 41-yard line.\nIowa State responds by forcing turnover on downs\nKansas State got a huge stop after a muffed punt in the first quarter. Now the Cyclones do the same following the Becht fumble. Klieman rolls the dice with a dive play to Joe Jackson on fourth-and-1, and Iowa State knifes through the line to stop Jackson short and force a turnover on downs. Defense continues to be showcased in Ireland.\nKansas State defense forces another turnover\nBall security continues to be an issue in this game, and snakebites the Cyclones once again. On third-and-long, Kansas State pins its ears back and strips Rocco Becht. The Wildcats will start from the Iowa State 16-yard line looking to take their first lead.\nKansas State opens second quarter with Avery Johnson TD\nIt shouldn't surprise anyone to see Avery Johnson keep the ball on the ground, but the Wildcats QB keeps the ball on the read option and the entire Iowa State defense bites. Kansas State ties the game at seven, and we have a new ballgame here in Dublin.\nFirst quarter: Iowa State 7, Kansas State 0\nFirst quarter ends with Kansas State threatening\nThe first quarter ends with Kansas State trailing 7-0, but the Wildcats will start the second with a third-and-4 deep in Iowa State territory. Kansas State has been unable to throw the ball, but the ground game has the Wildcats on the move.\nIowa State gets on the board\nDominic Overby's second catch of the day is a gorgeous ball from Rocco Becht for a touchdown. Becht hits Overby on a 23-yard fade, and Iowa State takes an early lead in Ireland. Becht was 3-for-3 for 46 yards on the scoring drive.\nDylan Edwards goes to Kansas State locker room, Kansas State punts again\nAnother three-and-out for Kansas State, but the Wildcats now have bigger issues. Dylan Edwards' knee was injured on that muffed punt, and the Colorado transfer has gone to the Kansas State locker room.\nRead more about Edwards' injury here.\nCyclones punt it away\nDespite the first completion of the game from either side from Becht to Dominic Overby, Iowa State goes three-and-out and punts it away. Kansas State starts from its own 16-yard line for its second series of the game.\nWildcats go three-and-out on opening series\nWeather is looking like a factor in Ireland.\nKansas State goes three-and-out in a run-run-pass series. It's hard to be overly inspiring calling plays when it's raining. On his lone pass attempt, Johnson underthrows his receiver who drops what is still a catchable ball, and Iowa State will get the ball back.\nKansas State gets the ball following ISU fumble\nOh, so it's one of THOSE games.\nIowa State returns Kansas State's favor with a botched toss, and the Wildcats fall on the ball! Huge stand for the defense, and Avery Johnson will take the field for the first time in a scoreless game.\nIowa State drive continues after pass interference\nMental errors are taking a toll early for Kansas State. VJ Payne gets called for pass interference at the top of an Iowa State corner route, and the drive continues.\nKansas State forces punt on opening drive, muffs punt\nThe Wildcat defense won't take kindly to that. After allowing a first down, Kansas State forces a punt. However, it muffs the punt and Iowa State gets the ball back on the Kansas State 8-yard line without the defense taking a snap. Brutal start for K-State's special teams.\nKansas State-Iowa State set to kickoff\nKansas State won the toss and deferred to the second half. Iowa State will receive first to kick off the 2025 season.\nKansas State, Iowa State nearly ready to kick off\nThe stage is set for Kansas State vs Iowa State, with the Wildcats and Cyclones taking the field. Week 0 and college football are just around the corner.\nKansas State vs Iowa State injury report\nNeither Kansas State nor Iowa State enter this game completely healthy, with safety Gunner Maldonado being probable, Asa Newsom questionable and Colby McCalister out.\nSee the full injury report here.\nRocco Becht stats vs Kansas State\nRocco Becht is 2-0 in his two games against the Wildcats.\nIn his first game, he completed 8 of 12 passes for 230 yards and three touchdowns. Last season, Becht went 13 of 35 for two touchdowns and rushed eight times for 35 yards and another touchdown.\nAvery Johnson stats vs Iowa State\nIn a loss to Iowa State last season, Wildcats QB Avery Johnson completed 12 of 28 passes for 220 yards and three touchdowns. It was his only game with under a 50% completion percentage on the season. Johnson also ran 13 times for 64 yards.\nKansas State-Iowa State Farmageddon nickname\nPlenty of rivalry games have kitschy nicknames, but perhaps none is quirkier than Kansas State-Iowa State's \"Farmageddon\" moniker.\nWhy are Kansas State, Iowa State playing in Ireland?\nKansas State and Iowa State are facing off in Ireland for the Aer Lingus Classic.\nRead the USA TODAY network to find out more about this international series, and why Aviva Stadium has become a Week 0 staple.\nWhat is college football's Week 0?\nKansas State vs Iowa State is the headliner, but what is Week 0 in college football?
