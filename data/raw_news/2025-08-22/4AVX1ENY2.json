  "title": "Number of Germans Owning Stocks Soars 44% in Last Decade",
  "description": "As the German stock market booms for a third year, racking up gains of more than 20% in 2025, the number of Germans who own equities is up 44% from a decade ago, and the assets in exchange-traded funds have soared an estimated 200% since 2017 to \u20ac343 billion ($400 billion), industry data show. Bloomberg's Isolde MacDonogh reports. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Germany? No, not really known for its share of mom and pop investors, for retail investors. But things are starting are starting to change. The DAX is up 20% year to date. What is drawing them into the market? Is it simply these kind of record breaking runs that we're seeing in terms of German equities? Yes, as you mentioned, Tom, and good morning. The DAX is up 20% year to date. It's also been up the past two years before that as well. And I think that that's giving an idea that, you know, stocks are something that people might want to invest in, in Germany. And also with ETFs, which are seen as safer, people are really piling in now. And we've seen 3 million Germans invest in three years, which is pretty exciting. And but I think it's also, you know, worries about things like pensions here. And that's been quite a narrative that the pension system here is not maybe working as well as it could. You've got, you know, current workers paying for current pensioners. And there was a study that by 2050 and you might have one worker paying for two whole pensioners. So, you know, I think I think things like that have been really worrying people and they want to make sure that their future is safe and the future of their children is safe. Okay. So a bit of a bit a bit of fear and greed factor factoring into this move with 3 million. You said 3 million additional investors in Germany. What have investors been one of these investors being these mom and pop investors been telling you that is older? What has kind of changed in terms of the attitude amongst this crowd of investors? Yeah. I mean, I think that that sensing some opportunity here and also I mean if you go on the coupon or something like this, you see these ads for and you know, get rich, make some money and you've got them organized by, you know, banks who who have platforms where you can trade and you also have sentences. And we spoke to an 82 year old for free. And so when we were writing this article and he was very excited because he said, you know, finally things are looking up. He'd been a banker before and he'd always complained that German people were a bit too reticent about about investing in stocks. And he sensed a change. And, you know, I think these things like TikTok and Instagram, you know, you can really you can really reach people and young people and people who are maybe less scarred by, you know, Germany's history, which, of course, you know, after the First World War, you had this hyperinflation. And I think I think those memories, you know, they continue. And Germans have always been, you know, very, very good savers, you know, instead of taking more risk.",
