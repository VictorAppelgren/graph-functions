  "content": "Bloomberg's Mark Gurman expects Apple to release new AirPods Pro this year, and he said the earbuds will have a key new feature: heart rate monitoring.\n\n\n\nFrom his Power On newsletter today, with emphasis added:\n\nAs for Apple's other devices, there's a lot in the fall pipeline \u2014 though many of the new products are only incremental upgrades. There will be Apple Watch updates, faster Vision Pro headsets and iPad Pros with the M5 processor. You should also expect new AirPods Pro earbuds (I reported earlier this year that Apple is working on a pair with heart-rate monitoring), as well as HomePod minis and Apple TV set-top boxes.\n\nApple already introduced a heart rate monitoring feature on the Powerbeats Pro 2 earlier this year.\n\nWhen both Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds are placed in the ears, and heart rate monitoring is active, Apple says LED optical sensors pulse at over 100 times per second to measure heart rate via blood flow. The feature integrates with popular fitness apps to collect data during workouts and sync it to Apple's Health app on the iPhone.\n\nThe feature is based on the Apple Watch's heart rate sensing technology. If someone is wearing both Powerbeats Pro 2 and an Apple Watch, Apple says apps default to using Apple Watch heart rate data, and that will likely be the case for the new AirPods Pro too.\n\nBeyond heart rate monitoring, it is likely that the next AirPods Pro will feature improved sound quality, increased active noise cancellation, design changes, and more.\n\nThe current AirPods Pro 2 launched in September 2022, and they were updated with a USB-C charging case (instead of Lightning) and a few other tweaks in September 2023.",

      "text": "Apple's Beats brand is officially introducing the Powerbeats Pro 2 today, bringing significant updates to the wireless earphones aimed at active users. Among the upgrades for Powerbeats Pro 2 are Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) with Transparency mode, Personalized Spatial Audio, an H2 chip for improved power efficiency and Apple ecosystem integration, and for the first time in an Apple audio product, Heart Rate Monitoring.\nWe got an early preview of the Powerbeats Pro 2 a couple of weeks ago and have been able to spend additional time with them since then, so be sure to check out our hands-on video above for full impressions, and read on below for details on the specs.\nApple has been teasing the Powerbeats Pro 2 with celebrity appearances since last year, so we've known for quite a while that they feature a redesigned body but retain their trademark earhook that helps secure them during vigorous physical activity.\nWith the Powerbeats Pro 2, the earhook is 50 percent smaller than on the original Powerbeats Pro and has been reinforced with a nickel\u2013titanium alloy for greater flexibility and comfort, making it easy to slip on while ensuring it snaps back into shape for a secure fit. An IPX4 rating means Powerbeats Pro 2 are sweat and water resistant, while upgraded venting and a fifth ear tip size (XS, S, M, L, XL included) help ensure a comfortable fit.\nThe redesigned body reduces weight by 20 percent compared to the original Powerbeats Pro, but efficiency improvements delivered by the H2 chip boost battery life of the buds themselves to 10 hours with ANC off compared to 9 hours with the previous generation. The onboard battery in the case pushes total battery life to 45 hours, up significantly from the previous 24 hours even though the case is 33 percent smaller. The case is also the first ever from Beats to support wireless Qi charging in addition to USB-C.\nOn the audio performance side, the Powerbeats Pro 2 feature a redesigned acoustic architecture with a custom-designed dual-layer transducer plus a host of modern Apple earphone features that were missing from the previous generation: Active Noise Cancellation with Transparency mode to selectively allow outside sound in, Adaptive EQ to adjust frequencies in real-time for optimal sound, and Personalized Spatial Audio with head tracking to make it feel like sound remains anchored to the device that's playing it.\nPowerbeats Pro 2 are also the first Beats product to support Lossless Audio with ultra-low latency, optimized for Vision Pro with the H2 chips in both devices working together to deliver an immersive audio/video experience with Apple's headset.\nA key new feature for active users is Heart Rate Monitoring, a feature MacRumors discovered some time ago based on code in Apple's software updates. When both earbuds are in the ears and Heart Rate Monitoring is active, LED optical sensors pulse at over 100 times per second to measure heart rate via blood flow, integrating with popular fitness apps to collect data during workouts and sync it to the Apple Health app. Supported apps at launch include Open (meditation), Peloton (various fitness workouts), Runna (running), Slopes (skiing), Ladder (strength training), Nike Run Club (running), and YaoYao (jump roping).\nFor iOS users, Heart Rate Monitoring automatically begins when a workout is started in a compatible app, and it automatically ends when the workout is stopped. Android users will need to manually turn on Heart Rate Monitoring via the earbuds themselves or in the Beats app, but monitoring will automatically end when the workout is completed.\nApple says that when a user is wearing both an Apple Watch and Powerbeats Pro 2, apps and Apple Health will default to using data from the Apple Watch, a choice Apple made to not disrupt the existing base of Apple Watch users who have already been tracking heart rate data. Apple notes, however, that both methods have been thoroughly validated and should yield similar results.\nPowerbeats Pro 2 can also be paired to compatible gym equipment to enable at-a-glance viewing as you work out.\nThanks to the H2 chip, you can expect the full suite of Apple integration features with Powerbeats Pro 2, including one-touch pairing, automatic switching between devices via iCloud, Audio Sharing to allow multiple people to listen to the same audio source, hands-free Siri, and Find My support. Android users get many of the same features through the Beats app, including one-touch pairing, Heart Rate Monitoring control, customizable functionality, and a Find My-like Locate My Beats function.\nPowerbeats Pro 2 include the iconic \"b\" logo button on each earbud, and you can customize the press-and-hold gesture to either cycle through Noise Control modes or activate Siri. Quicker single and double presses of the \"b\" button perform traditional functions like play/pause, track skip, and answer/mute/end calls. Each earbud also features a tactile volume rocker, making it easy to adjust volume right from your earbud without needing to mess with your connected device.\nEach earbud includes three microphones and a voice accelerometer, leveraging advanced computational audio and machine-learning algorithms to optimize call performance with features like Voice Isolation to reduct background noise.\nPowerbeats Pro 2 are available to order at apple.com starting today in four colors: Electric Orange, Hyper Purple, Jet Black, and Quick Sand. They're available at the same $249.99 price point as the previous generation, and they will be on store shelves starting this Thursday, February 13."

      "text": "Should You Buy AirPods Pro?\nThe AirPods Pro 2 are Apple's premium in-ear wireless earbuds, offering a range of features like Active Noise Cancellation, precision finding, touch volume controls, and more. Refreshed in September 2023 with a USB-C port, the AirPods Pro 2 are getting closer to the end of their product cycle and rumors suggest that we're going to get an update later in 2025. At this point, most people should wait to buy the AirPods Pro, though it's still a reasonable time to buy for those who don't care about having the newest bells and whistles.\nThe next-generation AirPods Pro are expected to feature a refreshed design, improved ANC and sound quality, and they may get health-related features like heart rate monitoring and temperature sensing.\nWith a $249 price tag, AirPods can be more expensive than some of their direct competitors, but it's important to note that the H2 chips inside the AirPods offer a seamless and fully integrated pairing and device-switching experience for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV users, which competitors are unable to match. The H2 chips also enable features like Adaptive EQ and spatial audio with dynamic head tracking. This means that when used with Apple devices, AirPods seem to be the best option for earbuds when it comes to features.\nIf you are looking for AirPods without an in-ear design, there are the AirPods 4, which start at $129. For an even higher-fidelity AirPods experience and an over-ear design, there are the AirPods Max which start at $549. On the other hand, if you feel that the AirPods Pro are too expensive, but you would still like Apple's seamless pairing and device-switching experience, Beats headphones are also viable options, with prices starting from as little as $69 for Beats Flex.\nTo get MacRumors readers the best prices on the AirPods Pro, we have a dedicated AirPods deals guide that highlights the best sales each month.\nAirPods Pro 2\nContents\n- Should You Buy AirPods Pro?\n- AirPods Pro 2\n- How to Buy\n- Reviews\n- AirPods Pro Design\n- Active Noise Cancellation\n- Sound Quality\n- H2 Chip\n- Gesture Support\n- Hearing Health\n- Other AirPods Features\n- Features Coming in iOS 26\n- Battery Life\n- Find My\n- Firmware\n- AirPods Pro How Tos\n- Other AirPods\n- What's Next for the AirPods Pro\n- AirPods Pro Roundup Changelog\n- AirPods Pro Timeline\nApple in September 2023 refreshed the AirPods Pro, introducing a new version of the AirPods Pro 2 that initially came out in September 2022.\nApple did not introduce any design changes for the updated AirPods Pro 2, but they do have a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. Apple also added support for Lossless Audio when the USB-C AirPods Pro 2 are paired with the upcoming Apple Vision Pro headset, and improved dust resistance. Aside from these features, the USB-C AirPods Pro 2 are identical to the AirPods Pro 2 with Lightning port that came out in 2022.\nThe AirPods Pro feature a rounded design with silicone ear tips and a short stem that harken back to the first AirPods. As with all in-ear AirPods, the AirPods Pro come only in white, with no other color options available.\nApple added an updated H2 chip that enables new capabilities, including Active Noise Cancellation that's twice as good. Noise-cancelling microphones and a rear vent detect sound coming in, countering it before it reaches the ear. Apple says the AirPods Pro 2 reduce noise by sampling incoming sound at 48,000 times per second.\nTransparency mode has been updated with an Adaptive Transparency feature that is designed to reduce loud environmental noise without blocking out all sound. It can cut down on the sound of a passing vehicle siren, construction tools, loud speakers at a concert, and more. This is done using on-device processing enabled by the H2 chip.\nAlong with an H2 chip, the AirPods Pro 2 are equipped with a low-distortion audio driver and a custom amplifier, which Apple says bring richer bass and crystal-clear sound across a wider range of frequencies.\nFor a more customized fit, AirPods Pro now have silicone ear tips in XS, S, M, and L sizes, with XS available as the new size option.\nPersonalized Spatial Audio is available for an optimized, immersive surround sound experience with dynamic head tracking, and Adaptive EQ customizes the sound so you hear songs as they were intended based on how the AirPods Pro fit in your ears.\nThe AirPods Pro 2 stems now include Touch control, adding physical media playback and volume adjustment options that can be accessed right on the earbuds. A swipe up or down on the AirPods Pro touch sensor enables volume adjustments, and a press can change the music or answer phone calls, plus \"Hey Siri\" support is included.\nAirPods Pro features like seamless switching between devices signed into the same iCloud account, quick one-tap setup, and audio sharing are all supported.\nBattery life is improved and the AirPods Pro 2 last for up to six hours on a single charge when Active Noise Cancellation is turned on. The included charging case provides a total of 30 hours of listening time, six hours more than the prior-generation model.\nThe AirPods Pro 2 MagSafe Charging Case can be charged using Qi, MagSafe, or the Apple Watch charging puck, a new feature. The case is IPX4 sweat and water resistant and it is now equipped with a lanyard loop so you can add an optional lanyard.\nThere's also a built-in speaker in the case so you can find your AirPods Pro charging case with Find My should it become lost, and with Precision Finding that uses the new U1 chip, the Find My app can direct you right to your lost AirPods Pro case.\nA new set of hearing health features for the AirPods Pro 2 can assist with protecting users from loud noise, conduct scientifically validated hearing tests to measure potential hearing loss, and serve as an over-the-counter clinical-grade hearing aid for those experiencing hearing loss.\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback? Send us an email here.\nHow to Buy\nThe AirPods Pro 2 can be ordered from the Apple online store or purchased in an Apple retail location. AirPods Pro are priced at $249, and can be customized with a Memoji, Animoji, or emoji engraving.\nApple's refurbished store sells the AirPods Pro 2 with Lightning case at a discounted price.\nReviews\nInitial reviews of the AirPods Pro 2 praised the device's improved audio quality, longer battery life, and up to 2x as much noise cancellation compared to the original AirPods Pro. They also discussed the swipe-based volume controls, skin-detect sensors that more accurately turn on or off audio playback, and the new XS ear tip option.\nThe Verge's Chris Welch said there are \"substantial\" improvements to active noise cancellation:\nBut Apple has made substantial gains with its active noise cancellation. The company says, on average, the new implementation is \"up to\" two times as effective as the original AirPods Pro. And while I lack any scientific measurement tools, that claim doesn't seem unrealistic. At our office, I recently moved desks and now sit near an air vent that emits a persistent whir. The original AirPods Pro leave a trace of that in noise-canceling mode, but it's completely hushed and imperceptible with the second-gen pair. I can still hear chatting co-workers if they walk directly next to my desk, but at most times, the AirPods Pro grant me plenty of serenity. I've also observed legitimate improvements when commuting on the subway, and less overall street noise makes its way through when traversing Brooklyn day to day.\nWelch also noticed improved sound quality overall:\nLet's dig right into sound quality. Apple completely redesigned the amplifier and driver in the AirPods Pro, and while those drivers are the same 11-millimeter size as what's in the third-gen AirPods, they sound superior and deliver the cleanest, most dynamic output of any AirPods to date.\nEngadget's Billy Steele achieved around six hours of battery life as advertised:\nDuring my tests, I managed six hours and fifteen minutes of use with a mix of noise cancellation, transparency mode and calls. That's more than the previous generation (4.5 hours) and it's on par with most of the competition these days. Sure, some companies offer 10-plus hours on a charge, but the average is around five to seven for the noise-canceling products I've tested. More battery life would always be nice, but the six or seven hours Apple musters is enough to get you through the workday if you take a short break.\nGizmodo's Andrew Liszewski said the new swipe-based volume control feature is a welcomed upgrade, but can be \"a little finicky\" on occasion:\nIt's a welcome upgrade, but unfortunately one that I found a little finicky to make work. It occasionally required a couple of swipes before anything happened. As someone who generally hates having to touch my earbuds while I'm wearing them (it inevitably dislodges them a little) I will probably continue to stick to using Siri voice commands for volume adjustments or track skipping (the one thing Siri does very well).\nMobileSyrup's Patrick O'Rourke said swipe-based volume control is his favorite new AirPods Pro feature, providing for a more convenient listening experience:\nIn my experience, the new AirPods Pro volume touch controls are extremely responsive and work with subtle changes. If you, for example, only want to lower or raise the volume by a notch or two, you can do that with a brief swipe. The controls are also marked with a slight clicking noise, indicating they're active and working. I didn't run into any accidental presses during my several days with the AirPods Pro (2nd-Gen), even while long-pressing on the stem to toggle Active Noise Cancellation on/off or double-pressing to jump between songs. On-device touch volume controls are by far my favourite new AirPods Pro feature. The convenience and ease of use of shifting volume levels directly on the AirPods Pro (2nd-Gen) without the need to take out my iPhone, really can't be understated.\nO'Rourke added that iOS 16's Personalized Spatial Audio feature is not very noticeable:\nIn theory, I like the idea of audio being tuned specifically to the shape of your ear, but in practice, it doesn't make much of a difference. It's also worth noting that while I really like Spatial Audio when watching movies or TV shows on platforms like Apple TV+, I find it hit or miss with music, especially when a track wasn't originally recorded with the technology in mind and has been remastered.\nWIRED's Parker Hall said the charging case's new built-in speaker \"rings quite loudly\" to assist with Find My location tracking, but he wishes the case had a USB-C port for wired charging instead of the usual Lightning connector:\nNeed to find the case via Apple's Find My app? Now you can, and it rings quite loudly. It also makes a little jingle when it starts charging. Speaking of, you can wireless charge as usual (the case supports MagSafe too), but it's a shame to see Apple still relying on the Lightning port instead of USB-C.\nAirPods Pro Design\nThe AirPods Pro 2 feature the same design as the original AirPods Pro, despite rumors that we could see some major changes. There were rumors of a stemless design, but that did not pan out, and Apple is continuing to use the same rounded in-ear bud with flexible silicone tips and a short stem.\nApple designed the silicone tips to confirm to the contours of each individual ear, ensuring a comfortable fit and a good seal, an important factor for noise cancellation. The AirPods Pro 2 tips come in extra small, small, medium, and large, and the tips click into place on the AirPods Pro for easy swapping.\nThe AirPods Pro measure in at 30.9mm tall and 21.8mm wide, identical to the original AirPods Pro. They weigh 5.3 grams.\nThere is a skin-detect sensor in the AirPods that is designed to better detect when the AirPods are removed from the ears in order to preserve battery life.\nThe AirPods Pro 2 continue to feature a vent system for pressure equalization when using Active Noise Cancellation. It is designed to minimize the discomfort that can happen with other earbud designs.\nMagSafe Charging Case\nApple is selling the AirPods Pro 2 with an updated MagSafe Charging Case that has a magnet inside for use with MagSafe charging accessories.\nThe case measures in at 60.6mm wide, 45.2mm tall, and 21.7mm thick, so despite the addition of a new charging feature, the case is identical to the first-generation AirPods Pro case, though it is slightly heavier. The AirPods Pro MagSafe Charging Case weighs 50.8 grams for a total weight of 56.1 grams with the AirPods Pro inside. The original AirPods Pro case weighed 45.6 grams.\nNew to the Charging Case is a lanyard loop for attaching third-party lanyards, and a speaker that can allow the case to play a sound when used with the Find My feature.\nThere is a U1 chip in the MagSafe Charging Case which allows it to work with Precision Finding in the Find My app with an iPhone that has an Ultra Wideband chip.\nWater Resistance\nApple says that the AirPods Pro and the MagSafe Charging Case are \"sweat and water resistant,\" offering IPX4 water resistance. IPX4 water resistance was also a feature of the original AirPods Pro, but the case is more water resistant now.\nIPX4 water resistance means the AirPods Pro and the case can hold up to sweat and light rain, but they should not be submerged and liquid exposure should be avoided when possible. Apple's warranty does not cover water or sweat damage.\nEar Tip Fit Test\nTo get the perfect fit and best audio experience, Apple offers an Ear Tip Fit Test for the AirPods Pro. After placing the AirPods Pro in each ear, Apple uses advanced algorithms and the microphones in each AirPod to measure the sound level in the ear and compare it to what's coming from the speaker driver.\nThe algorithm then detects whether the ear tip is the right size and has a good fit, or if it should be swapped out for another size to create a better seal. AirPods Pro silicone tips come in XS, S, M, and L, with XS offered as a new option.\nActive Noise Cancellation\nActive Noise Cancellation (ANC) has been notably improved, and the AirPods Pro 2 cancel up to twice as much noise as the prior-generation AirPods Pro.\nANC uses the microphones built into the AirPods Pro along with Apple's software algorithms to adapt sound to each person's ear. The outward-facing microphone detects external sound so the AirPods Pro can analyze environmental noise, while the inward-facing microphone listens to the sound coming toward the ear. ANC adapts the sound signal reaching the ears 48,000 times per second.\nThe AirPods Pro 2 are equipped with a new driver and improved acoustic algorithms to reduce more unwanted noise.\nAdaptive Transparency\nApple updated the AirPods Pro with a new Adaptive Transparency feature that builds on the Transparency mode introduced with the first-generation AirPods Pro.\nTransparency Mode is designed to allow AirPods Pro users to hear the world around them, listening for traffic, train announcements, and more while also not blocking out music, podcasts, and other audio content.\nApple's new Adaptive Transparency uses on-device processing to reduce loud environmental sounds to a more comfortable level. It can lower the volume of a passing vehicle siren, construction tools, or loud speakers at a concert.\nAdaptive Audio\nFor the AirPods Pro 2, an Adaptive Audio option blends the Transparency and Active Noise Cancellation modes into one, automatically tailoring noise control based on your environment and interactions throughout the day.\nAdaptive Audio is meant to drown out the environmental sounds that you don't want to hear like construction noise or the noise of an airplane, while letting you hear important announcements and conversations.\nPersonalized Volume adjusts the sound of what's playing based on your personal preferences and the sounds around you, with the iPhone learning more about the volume you like over time. With Conversation Awareness, when someone is speaking, media volume is lowered, background noise is reduced, and the voices in front of you are enhanced.\nSound Quality\nApple's AirPods Pro 2 are outfitted with an updated custom high-excursion low-distortion Apple driver and a custom high dynamic range amplifier, which Apple says brings richer, deeper bass and crystal-clear sound at all volume levels.\nMicrophones\nThere are two dual beamforming microphones and an inward-facing microphone for Active Noise Cancellation purposes.\nAdaptive EQ\nAdaptive EQ is designed to improve sound quality by taking into account the shape of the ear. The feature uses computational audio and an updated internal microphone pointed toward the ear to optimize sound for each person.\nSound is tuned in real time based on the fit of the AirPod in the user's ear, with the AirPods Pro adjusting and tuning the low and mid frequencies for consistent playback every time.\nApple says the new H2 chip uses new adaptation algorithms to process sound more quickly, tuning audio at the precise second that it is heard, for higher-fidelity sound. Phone calls also sound more natural thanks to voice enhancement algorithms.\nSpatial Audio\nApple introduced Spatial Audio in 2021, bringing a surround sound like experience to Apple Music, the Apple TV app, and more. With Dolby Atmos tracks in Apple Music, the AirPods Pro can provide a multi-dimensional audio experience that makes it so the sound comes from all around you.\nSpatial audio applies directional audio filters and subtly adjusts the frequencies that each ear receives to place sounds virtually anywhere in space for an immersive listening experience. The feature uses sensors in the AirPods Pro along with sensors in the iPhone or iPad to track the motion of a person's head as well as the position of their device, comparing the motion data and remapping the sound field so that it stays anchored to the device even as the head moves.\nDynamic head tracking works with spatial audio and on Group FaceTime calls so it sounds like the FaceTime participants are right in the room with you.\nThe AirPods Pro also support Personalized Spatial Audio, which is an iOS 16 feature. With Personalized Spatial Audio, you can use your TrueDepth camera to scan the area around you to create a custom sound experience.\nVoice Isolation\nVoice Isolation cuts down on background noise so your voice sounds clearer to the person you're speaking with on a phone call. The microphones on the AirPods Pro will avoid picking up ambient noise with Voice Isolation, prioritizing your voice.\nVision Pro Lossless Audio\nWhen paired with the Apple Vision Pro, the 2023 AirPods Pro with a USB-C port support 20-bit 48kHz lossless audio. Lossless audio with the Apple Vision Pro is limited to the newest version of the AirPods Pro 2, and this feature is not be available on the original AirPods Pro 2.\nH2 Chip\nThere is a new H2 chip inside the AirPods Pro 2, which is an improvement over the prior H1 chip. The H2 powers all of the features in the AirPods, including Active Noise Cancellation, Transparency Mode, and Adaptive EQ.\nThe H2 chip also continues to enable the features AirPods have come to be known for, including fast switching between Apple devices that are signed into the same iCloud account, \"Hey Siri\" support, instant pairing, and Audio Sharing, which allows more than one set of AirPods to be paired to a single device.\nBluetooth\nThe AirPods Pro support the latest Bluetooth 5.3 specification. Bluetooth 5.3 includes enhancements that can improve reliability and energy efficiency. The specification also includes LE Audio, but Apple does not yet appear to have implemented support for LE Audio.\nOther Sensors\nThere's a motion-detecting accelerometer and a speech detecting accelerometer in the AirPods Pro in addition to the skin-detect sensor. All of these sensors work together to power AirPods features like ear detection.\nGesture Support\n- Swipe up or down on the stem to adjust the volume\n- Press once to play/pause\n- Press once to answer an incoming phone call\n- Press twice to skip forward\n- Press three times to skip back\n- Press and hold to swap between ANC and Adaptive Transparency\n- Nod yes to accept calls, shake your head to decline. Also works for Siri responses\nHearing Health\nWith iOS 18.1, Apple introduced a new suite of hearing health features for the AirPods Pro 2 encompassing prevention, awareness, and assistance related to hearing loss. Hearing Protection, on by default across all listening modes, helps reduce loud sounds with a combination of passive noise reduction thanks to the silicone ear tips, while the H2 chip provides active reduction of louder, intermittent sounds.\nOn the awareness side, Apple introduced a scientifically validated Hearing Test features that lets users check their own hearing from the comfort of their homes, with results securely stored in the Health app and able to be shared with healthcare providers.\nAnd finally, AirPods Pro are becoming the first over-the-counter clinical-grade hearing aid device thanks to personalized audio adjustments created based Hearing Test results. The functionality is available in the United States, UK, Australia, and 100 other countries and regions.\nOther AirPods Features\n- Mute and Unmute - Press on the stem of the AirPods Pro (any model) or AirPods 3, or AirPods 4 to mute and unmute yourself on a call. On AirPods Max, press on the Digital Crown.\n- Automatic Device Switching - Automatic Switching between Apple devices is quicker and more reliable. This is limited to AirPods Pro 2 paired with an iPhone XR/iPhone XS or later.\n- Dark Mode - When connecting the AirPods to the iPhone, if your iPhone is in Dark Mode, the connection popup is also shown in Dark Mode.\nFeatures Coming in iOS 26\nThe upcoming iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS Tahoe updates will add new features to the AirPods when paired with an upcoming AirPods firmware update that will come out alongside the new software.\nStudio Quality Recording\nThe AirPods 4 and the AirPods Pro 2 can be used to record studio-quality audio for interviews, podcasts, songs, videos, and more. Apple says that the feature can be used to record high-quality vocals while on the go.\nYou can record higher-quality audio when making videos or using your devices to do things like record a podcast.\nImproved Audio Quality\nThe studio-quality recording feature brings more natural vocal texture and clarity to iPhone calls, FaceTime calls, and all CallKit-enabled apps like Zoom.\nBoth studio-quality audio recording and improved call quality are available across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and support the Camera app, Voice Memos, Messages dictation, third-party camera apps, and video conferencing apps.\nCamera Remote\nThe AirPods can be used as a camera remote with the Camera app and third-party camera apps on iPhone or iPad. Just press and hold on the AirPods stem to take a photo or start a video recording.\nWhen the recording is finished, a press and hold gesture will stop the recording. Apple says that users who like to capture themselves singing and dancing for social networks like TikTok will be able to easily perform in sync with a soundtrack while simultaneously recording video.\nUpdate Interface\nWith the latest software updates, Apple is finally adding a way to manually update the firmware on your AirPods. When your AirPods are connected, you can go to the Settings app to get to a new software update interface.\nPause Audio for Sleep\nIf you're listening to music, a podcast, or a book while you're in bed and you're wearing AirPods, the AirPods will pause your audio when you fall asleep.\nKeep Audio in Headphones\nWhen you use AirPods, you can opt to keep audio in your headphones when other playback devices like cars and speakers connect to the iPhone.\nLive Translation\nApple is working on a Live Translation feature that will be added to the AirPods. The feature will go along with the Live Translation options for Messages, Phone, and FaceTime in iOS 26, and it will be activated with a double press.\nLive Translation will provide a spoken translation of what a person is saying in real-time if you're conversing with someone that speaks a different language. Because the other Live Translation features require Apple Intelligence, Live Translation for AirPods will as well.\nBattery Life\nOn their own, the AirPods Pro 2 offer up to six hours of listening time, or 5.5 hours with Spatial Audio and Head Tracking enabled. When used for talking, the battery lasts for a total of 4.5 hours. The AirPods Pro 2 earbuds feature a battery capacity of 49.7 mAh, up 15 percent from 43.2 mAh capacity of the prior-generation AirPods Pro earbuds, which accounts for some of the difference in battery life.\nThe MagSafe Charging Case has a battery capacity of 523 mAh, up just 4 mAh over the prior-generation case. With the MagSafe Charging Case, the AirPods Pro 2 offer up to 30 hours of listening time and 24 hours of talk time before needing to be recharged. Charging can be done using a MagSafe charger, a Lightning cable, a Qi-based charger, or, new this year, the Apple Watch charger.\nApple says that five minutes in the charging case provides the AirPods Pro with one hour of listening time or one hour of talk time.\nFind My\nBoth the AirPods Pro 2 and the MagSafe Charging Case work with the Find My app, so if any component is lost, it can be located using another Apple device. The Charging Case has a U1 chip so it can be tracked down with Precision Finding on a compatible iPhone, and with the new built-in speakers, the case can play a sound so it's easier to find.\nFirmware\nApple regularly updates the software that runs on the AirPods Pro. The current firmware for the AirPods Pro 2 is version 7E93, released in March 2025. The 7E93 firmware added bug fixes and performance improvements. Firmware can be installed by connecting the AirPods Pro to an iPhone, iPad, or Mac, putting them in the case, and charging the case.\nAirPods Pro How Tos\nOther AirPods\nThe AirPods Pro 2 are available alongside the AirPods 4, priced starting at $129, and the over-ear AirPods Max, priced at $549.\nApple's AirPods 4 are similar to the AirPods Pro, but without silicone ear tips. The cheaper model priced at $129 does not offer Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) technology, but the $179 model includes ANC plus a wireless charging case that also includes a speaker for Find My support. The AirPods Max also feature ANC, but are larger over-ear headphones made from aluminum.\nWhat's Next for the AirPods Pro\nApple will introduce a redesigned version of the AirPods Pro in 2025, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Audio quality and design will be refined, with Apple also adding a faster chip. The next-generation AirPods Pro could include \"much better\" Active Noise Cancellation capabilities compared to the AirPods Pro 2, according to rumors. No information about how Apple will improve ANC is available at this time.\nIn February, Apple debuted the Powerbeats Pro 2 with a new heart rate monitoring feature that could eventually come to the AirPods Pro. The Powerbeats Pro 2 uses LED optical sensors that pulse more than 100 times per second to measure heart rate through blood flow. The heart rate monitoring feature works with popular fitness apps, syncing data to Apple Health.\nApple plans to bring this functionality to the AirPods Pro, perhaps in the AirPods Pro 3 that are expected in late 2025. Temperature sensing is also a possibility, and that would set the AirPods Pro apart from the Powerbeats Pro 2.\nThe AirPods Pro will get a refreshed design for both the earbuds and the case, but what the new design will look like remains a mystery. Apple slimmed down the case of the AirPods 4, so it's possible that'll happen with the AirPods Pro too.\nWith the AirPods 4, Apple also removed the setup button on the back of the case, opting instead for a concealed capacitive button. The included LED light is also subtler, and these are also changes we'll likely see for the AirPods Pro.\nThough several rumors suggest that new AirPods Pro will come in 2025, Analyst Jeff Pu says Apple won't launch a new model until 2026.\nFuture Updates\nBased on Apple's patent filings, a future version of the AirPods or AirPods Pro could include a built-in interactive touchscreen display that would let users control audio sources and interact with apps associated with the connected device, though there are no rumors of this technology coming in 2025.\nA future version of the AirPods will include integrated infrared camera modules to improve spatial experiences when paired with the Vision Pro headset. The cameras will work similarly to the Face ID system on the iPhone, scanning the area surrounding the user to better map the environment. The cameras could also provide data for more advanced AI capabilities.\nThe IR cameras will allow for a broader range of gestures that will improve user interaction and the syncing of audio to head movement. The cameras that will be added to the AirPods could also be used to scan the environment and describe objects, similar to the Visual Intelligence feature that's available on newer iPhones.\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes we could see these new AirPods as soon as 2026, but it is not yet clear if the feature will be added to the standard AirPods or a version of the AirPods Pro. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman thinks we could get AirPods with cameras in 2027, so this is another feature not expected in the 2025 refresh.\nAirPods Pro Roundup Changelog\n- August 22 - Added Live Translation info.\n- July 11 - General maintenance and reorganization.\n- June 27 - Added information on features coming in iOS 26.\n- June 17 - Updated with new rumors.\n- May 15 - Added new rumors about future AirPods Pro.\n- April 17 - Refreshed buyer's guide info.\n- March 31 - Updated with new firmware version.\n- March 25 - Updated hearing health info.\n- March 13 - Added info on future AirPods features, updated buyer's guide info.\n- February 24 - Updated to note Hearing Health is now in the UK."
