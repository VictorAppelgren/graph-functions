  "title": "Meme Stocks Are Coming Back in 2025 \u2014 3 Red Flags To Watch Out For",
  "description": "Meme stocks like Opendoor and Krispy Kreme have been spiking fast -- but are they good investments? Learn the red flags before you get burned by the hype.",
  "content": "Meme stocks are making a comeback this summer. In 2021, stocks like GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC) that no one cared about suddenly skyrocketed to all-time highs. This time, Opendoor (OPEN), Kohl\u2019s (KSS), GoPro (GPRO) and Krispy Kreme (DNUT) have all jumped in price not because these companies are doing better, but due to a wave of online hype.\n\nRead Next: Self-Made Millionaires Suggest 5 Stocks You Should Never Sell\n\nCheck Out: 9 Downsizing Tips for the Middle Class To Save on Monthly Expenses\n\nWhile some people will make quick profits, many others could lose money just as fast. Before you jump into meme stocks, here are some red flags you should look out for.\n\nWhen a stock skyrockets by hundreds of percent in a few days, it\u2019s easy to think you\u2019re missing out on something big. But in many cases, the surge is driven by hype, not company fundamentals.\n\nFor example, in late July, Yahoo Finance reported that Opendoor stock rose by more than 300% over the previous month. As of Aug. 12, 2025, GoPro has soared by more than 56% over the past month.\n\nWhen you see this pattern \u2014 stocks rising dramatically without any good news \u2014 it\u2019s often a sign of speculative frenzy. When the excitement fades, those gains can disappear quickly. So don\u2019t be the one jumping in late because you\u2019ll likely lose money.\n\nExplore More: Suze Orman: 3 Biggest Mistakes You Can Make as an Investor\n\nWhen a stock is heavily shorted, investors are betting it will drop, and it can lead to increased volatility. If the stock\u2019s price goes up instead, those investors will rush to buy it back to limit losses, which can drive the stock price even higher. This sudden surge is known as a short squeeze.\n\nIn late July, Forbes reported that nearly half (49%) of Kohl\u2019s outstanding shares were short positions, while Opendoor had approximately 21% of its shares sold short.\n\nThese jumps can be so tempting, but the real danger is that once those shorts are covered and buyers lose interest, prices can fall just as explosively as they rose.\n\nIn 2025, meme stocks aren\u2019t just riding the waves from Reddit forums. Artificial intelligence (AI) is turbocharging them. \u201cMeme stocks in 2025 rely on AI-driven sentiment analysis and real-time short-interest data, replacing viral tweets and impulsive buying,\u201d according to AInvest.\n\nAI-powered stock-tracking tools can scan social media, forums and news headlines for spikes in specific stock mentions or unusual trading activity. When a stock suddenly trends, these tools could alert thousands of traders. This can create a loop where the same stock names keep getting pushed online, potentially becoming meme stocks. That\u2019s one reason meme stocks can see wild gains in a matter of days and then plummet quickly once the loop moves on to the next big thing.",

      "text": "What Is Short Selling? The Basics and How It Works\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nShort selling is an investment technique that generates profits when shares of a stock go down rather than up. In most cases, shorting stocks is best left to the professionals. It\u2019s mostly institutional investors, such as hedge funds, that trade this way, according to Investor\u2019s Business Daily.\nHere\u2019s a look at how short selling works and why it\u2019s generally not on the short list of things every new investor should know.\nBefore You Start Short Selling\nBefore you can sell a stock short, you\u2019ll need to borrow shares to sell. You can usually accomplish this through your brokerage firm.\nHow Does Short Selling Work?\nHere\u2019s an overview of what it means to short a stock:\n- Borrow shares: Before you can sell a stock short, you\u2019ll need to borrow shares to sell. You can usually accomplish this through your brokerage firm.\n- Sell borrowed shares: Once you\u2019ve borrowed the stock, you sell the shares short in the open market.\n- Buy back shares at a lower price: The whole objective of shorting stocks is to profit when they fall in value. If you borrowed and sold shares at $50 per share, for example, selling them when they fall to $40 in the open market will generate a gain of $10 per share.\n- Return borrowed shares to lender: Once you buy back the shares on the open market, you close your position by returning them to the lender, typically through your brokerage firm.\nAn Example\nSay you identify a stock trading for $100 per share that you think will decline in value. You borrow 25 shares and sell them for $100 each, for a total sale of $2,500. When the price drops to $50 per share, you buy 25 shares to repay the loan. The $1,250 left over, less interest due to the lender, is your profit.\nWhat Type of Investor Should Short Sell?\nWho is short selling best for? Experienced investors. When you sell a stock short, you open yourself to very little, possibly unlimited loss.\nImagine, for example, that you sell a stock short at $100 per share, thinking it will drop in price. If that stock price doubles to $200 instead, you\u2019ll have to come up with an extra $100 per share to buy the stock back. If you shorted 100 shares, that\u2019s $10,000. Theoretically, the stock could go to hundreds of thousands of dollars per share, in which case, you would have to cover that loss out of pocket as well.\nAs the long-term trend of the market is up, you\u2019re always swimming upstream when you\u2019re shorting stocks. To succeed, you\u2019ll not only have to pick the right stock, you\u2019ll also have to sell it short at the exact right time. In addition to the risk of loss if the stock rises, you\u2019ll also be paying margin interest on the value of the shorted stock, according to Interactive Brokers. This makes research and risk management imperative when it comes to shorting stocks, something that may be beyond the abilities of beginning investors.\nPros and Cons of Short Selling\nLike all financial strategies, there are pros and cons to shorting stocks. You should be aware of both before you consider getting involved.\nPros\n- You can generate high profits in declining markets.\n- You can hedge your position by selling them, allowing you to protect yourself from a general market decline.\n- You can generate cash without having to sell any of your existing positions.\n- Leverage can magnify gains.\nCons\n- You court the risk of unlimited losses.\n- Market volatility and momentum can push stock prices higher, even with poorly managed or underperforming companies.\n- Leverage works both ways and can also magnify your losses.\n- The strategy can be complex.\nRisks Involved in Short Selling\nWhile the rewards of short selling can be high, so are the risks.\nNot Enough Shares To Borrow\nIf there aren\u2019t enough available shares to borrow or if your broker or lender recalls those borrowed shares, then you might be forced to close your short position before you\u2019re ready. This can limit your ability to profit, especially if the stock\u2019s price didn\u2019t drop as you expected. Stocks such as Joann (JOAN) or Allogene Therapeutics (ALLO) often do see low share availability.\nPotential for Unlimited Losses\nWhen you short a stock, you are on the hook to pay whatever price it rises to in the open market to buy back your borrowed shares. You could theoretically short a stock for $1 and have to buy it back for $100,000 or more, for example. This means your losses can greatly exceed your initial investment, which by definition makes short selling a risky endeavor.\nShort Squeezes\nThis can occur when a stock that is often heavily shorted suddenly jumps up in price. You might be forced to buy those shares back at a higher price than before, which in turn, also bumps up the cost.\nDividends\nIf the stock earns dividends while you are holding the short position, you won\u2019t receive those earnings. Instead, you must pay that dividend amount to the broker or lender you borrowed the shares from. This can lower the overall profit from short selling.\nMarket Volatility\nAnother reason why short selling is risky is that even if you are \u201cright\u201d in that a company should fundamentally trade lower, market sentiment and volatility can work against you. Probably the most famous recent example of this is the massive short squeeze that GameStop experienced in 2021.\nThe company itself was underperforming on a strictly financial basis, and numerous hedge funds had massive short positions. This was the birth of the so-called \u201cmeme stock\u201d phenomenon, with numerous small investors buying up shares and forcing hedge funds to cover their positions, ultimately driving the stock up 700% in 2021. Hedge funds like Melvin Capital lost 53% in January of that year alone, according to CNBC.\nSEC Regulations and Restrictions\nAs noted, there must be available shares to borrow before you can short a stock. If there\u2019s no inventory or if the brokerage firm can\u2019t locate shares, you can\u2019t short the stock.\nFor institutional investors, a new law passed in 2023 now requires short sellers to publish their gross short positions to the SEC monthly. Previously, institutional short sellers had operated somewhat in the shadows, and this regulation is meant to improve market transparency.\nThe longstanding \u201cuptick\u201d rule was greatly modified in 2010. Before that, short sellers could only sell their stock on an \u201cuptick,\u201d or when the most recent trade took place at a higher price than the prior one. As of 2010, however, this rule only applies to stocks that have lost more than 10% in a single day, according to the SEC.\nRestrictions in Other Countries\nShort selling is not generally banned in other countries, but it tends to come with stringent regulations. During the 2008 financial crisis, many countries, including the U.S., temporarily banned short selling, along with the UK, Australia, Canada and many other countries. As Fortune notes, however, South Korea had a ban on short selling through March 30, 2025, with severe criminal penalties applying to any short selling during that time; this has since been reinstated.\nIs It Worth The Risk?\nShort selling is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. Essentially, it\u2019s a bet that a stock will fall in price in a fairly short period, and getting that bet right can be difficult even for professional investors, especially since over time the market tends to go up, not down. The potential losses are theoretically unlimited, whereas with a long position, the most you can lose is the price you paid for your shares. Due to its risks and complexity, it\u2019s not ideal for beginning investors.\nShort Selling FAQ\nHere are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions regarding short selling.- What is the difference between short selling and buying long?\n- Short selling involves borrowing shares and selling them in the hopes that their price will fall. Buying long means owning a stock and hoping that its price will increase.\n- Is short selling legal in all countries?\n- Short selling is legal in most countries, although many have restrictions. In the United States, for example, you can only sell a stock short on an \"uptick,\" meaning the last trade has to be higher than the one prior to it, if a stock has fallen 10% or more in a single day. The USA, along with many other developed nations, does ban \"naked\" short selling, in which sellers short a stock before they have borrowed shares for the trade, according to law firm Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto.\n- How much money is required for short selling?\n- The margin requirement to sell a stock short is 150% of its value For example, if you want to short 100 shares of a stock trading at $200 per share, you'll need to have at least $30,000 in your account, according to Interactive Brokers. If the stock continues to trade higher, you may receive a margin call, which is a requirement to deposit additional funds.\n- How to tell if a stock is being shorted?\n- The percentage of a stock's shares that are being shorted is known as its short interest. This information is readily available from financial websites and from brokers like Charles Schwab, which lists each stock's short interest in its customers' accounts.\nDaria Uhlig contributed to the reporting for this article.\nOur in-house research team and on-site financial experts work together to create content that\u2019s accurate, impartial, and up to date.

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nHigh earners make investing mistakes, just like everyone else. The difference? More service providers try to sell them on \u201cthe next home run investment.\u201d\nAs someone who\u2019s seen enough success to build a seven-figure net worth, watch out for the following red flags in your investing decisions.\nScams Targeting the Rich\nThe rich have more money to lose, making them juicy targets for scammers.\nWatch out for anyone offering an investment that sounds too good to be true. Yes, it\u2019s possible to earn high returns with lower or moderate risk \u2014 but those typically come with other downsides, such as no liquidity, a long time commitment and a high minimum investment. Even then, stick with investments you can verify.\nStart by asking a simple question: Do I know and trust the person recommending an investment? If not, did someone I know and trust refer me to them? At a bare minimum, what do verified other investors say about them? What\u2019s their reputation in the industry, and how long have they been operating?\nOnly consider investing advice from people you\u2019ve verified in a compelling way. And when you try a new investment, follow the old maxim of \u201cstart low and go slow.\u201d\nInvestments That Make Your Advisor Money \u2014 Not You\nNot all scammers claim to be Nigerian princes. Some wear business suits and boast letters after their name.\nInvestment advisors sometimes take advantage of naive clients with deep pockets. After convincing them to pay a percentage of their portfolio in exchange for managing it, some unscrupulous advisors put their clients\u2019 money in expensive or inappropriate investments that provide some kind of kickback or commission to them.\nThere\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with hiring an investment advisor to manage your portfolio. Some may even be worth paying 0.5% to 1% as an annual fee. But as a general rule, hire these advisors to manage risk, not to try and beat the market.\nWatch out for any advisors who try to pitch you on picking stocks or beating the market.\nOverpaying Advisor Fees\nIn today\u2019s world of passive ETFs and index funds, you can match the market\u2019s returns by investing in just a few funds, with extremely low expense ratios.\nDon\u2019t know where to start? Try investing in the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund ETF (VTI) for broad U.S. stock market exposure or the Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF (VEU) for international stocks.\nOr just use a robo-advisor. Charles Schwab offers one for free that includes bells and whistles like tax loss harvesting and automated rebalancing.\nHubris When the Market Does Well\nSuccessful people didn\u2019t get that way by being fools. But success and cleverness in your career doesn\u2019t automatically make you a clever investor.\nJeremy Savory, CEO of tax consulting firm Millionaire Migrant, sees this mistake all the time among his millionaire clients. \u201cThe biggest red flag in my experience is ego. I always tell my clients, \u2018Hubris is your nemesis.'\u201d\nJust because the market and your investments do well doesn\u2019t make you an expert. Don\u2019t jump into the next shiny investment opportunity that comes your way assuming that everything you touch will turn to gold.\nManaging partner Richard McWhorter at SRM Private Wealth pointed to fear of missing out (FOMO) as a recurring theme among his wealthy clients. \u201cFOMO has been the biggest ongoing problem for investors who do not understand the risks that are involved in an investment.\u201d\nPanic When the Market Falls\nGreed drives poor buying decisions. Fear drives poor selling decisions.\nSometimes the stock market falls 50% or more, and fast. It can instill terror in otherwise calm investors. But wise investors stay the course and don\u2019t panic sell.\n\u201cToo many of my clients view the stock market as a lottery ticket to increase their net worth,\u201d explained Stuart Schiffman, CFP and founder of Compound Wealth Advisors. \u201cUnlike a casino where the odds are never in your favor, stock market returns have historically had significantly more up years than down years.\n\u201cIf my clients can commit to the stock market through thick and thin years, they will achieve greater returns than trying to time the market or pick the next Apple.\u201d\nOnly invest money in stocks that you can stomach seeing fall in value. Put money that you can\u2019t bear to see dip into less volatile investments.\nOverconcentration\nYour mother always told you not to put all your eggs in one basket. Look no further than the investors who lost enormous sums when Enron went from investors\u2019 darling to pariah virtually overnight for a reminder why.\nSavory watches this play out with many of his clients who earned money in one sector and remain overexposed to it. \u201cMany previous crypto millionaires \u2018HODLed\u2019 too long and then got wiped out. Or growth stock investors didn\u2019t diversify into cyclical and suffered a crash right before retirement.\u201d\nFor that matter, many successful employees get stock options from their companies. But over time, they make up a huge percentage of their net worth. If that company goes under, they lose not just their job but a massive portion of their wealth.\nDon Epperson, founder and CEO of family office platform Annise recommended that millionaires start thinking beyond paper assets like stocks and bonds. \u201cAs you build wealth, consider expanding your assets to include real estate and private investments.\u201d\nGolden Visa Programs\nMany millionaires start looking into a second citizenship abroad, often to lower their tax bill.\nBut citizenship by investment, or \u201cgolden visa\u201d programs, require six- or even seven-figure investments, usually in countries where you wouldn\u2019t have chosen to invest otherwise. And to stop paying U.S. taxes, you have to actually renounce your U.S. citizenship \u2014 which you probably aren\u2019t prepared to do.\nEven if you are, many of these programs come with hefty risks.\n\u201cNot all golden visa programs are created equal,\u201d said Mark Damsgaard, founder of visa and migration agency Global Residence Index. \u201cFraudulent agents, unverified investment projects and political instability pose significant risks to high-net-worth individuals.

      "text": "9 Downsizing Tips for the Middle Class To Save on Monthly Expenses\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nThere\u2019s only so much you can control about your financial situation. You can\u2019t snap your fingers and magically increase your salary. The reality is that if you\u2019re in the middle class, one of the biggest changes you can make is downsizing to save money on monthly expenses.\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean you have to give up everything you enjoy in your daily life. There are some pretty common expenses and purchasing habits the middle class can easily cut back on that can seriously improve their finances \u2014 especially for people with debt.\nCancel Your Unused Subscription Services\nOne of the easiest areas for middle-class families to save money, according to finance expert, Dennis Shirshikov, is by evaluating and downsizing their subscription services.\n\u201cMany households subscribe to multiple streaming services, digital magazines and monthly delivery boxes, often spending more than $100 per month,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile individually these services seem affordable, collectively they can add up significantly.\u201d\nA practical approach he recommended is to review all subscriptions and eliminate those that are rarely used or overlap in content.\n\u201cFor example, choosing one or two favorite streaming platforms instead of subscribing to five can save around $30 to $50 monthly,\u201d Shirshikov said.\nNegotiate Down Your High-Interest Debt\nIf you\u2019re in the middle class and carry debt, you know how much of your monthly budget it can eat up. Your balance keeps growing, and you can struggle to even make the minimum payments on top of all your other bills.\nWith debt settlement, their experts will negotiate directly with your lenders to agree on a reduced balance, meaning you could pay less than what you owe. With debt consolidation, all your debt is combined into one new loan, ideally with a lower interest rate. This helps you pay off your balance faster and saves money on interest payments.\nDine In Rather Than Dine Out\nAnother significant expense for many middle-class families is dining out and takeout, Shirshikov said.\n\u201cWhile convenient, frequently eating out can quickly become a financial drain,\u201d he said. \u201cAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average household spends about $3,000 annually on food away from home. Reducing the frequency of dining out by planning meals and cooking at home can result in substantial savings.\u201d\nEdit Your Car Expenses\nAccording to Shirshikov, downsizing vehicle-related expenses is another effective way to save money.\n\u201cMany middle-class families own multiple cars, which can be costly when considering insurance, maintenance, fuel, and loan payments,\u201d he said.\nShirshikov said evaluating the necessity of each vehicle and considering alternatives like carpooling, public transportation or even biking can lead to significant savings. \u201cFor example, selling a second car that is rarely used can save on insurance and maintenance costs, potentially freeing up $200 to $400 monthly.\u201d\nBundle Your Cable and Internet Packages\n\u201cThe rise of streaming services and online content has made traditional cable packages less essential,\u201d Shirshikov said. \u201cMiddle-class families can often find more cost-effective options by downgrading their cable packages or switching to internet-only plans combined with streaming services. According to a report by DecisionData.org, the average cable bill in the U.S. is about $217 per month.\u201d\nHe said by cutting the cord and opting for a high-speed internet plan paired with a few streaming subscriptions, families can save upwards of $100 per month.\nJustin Godur, finance advisor and founder of Capital Max, agreed. \u201cOften, we subscribe to expensive cable packages thinking we need numerous channels or premium content,\u201d he said.\nHowever, he noted that most people don\u2019t utilize half of what they pay for. \u201cOpting for selective streaming services or a basic cable package can save a substantial amount each month.\u201d\nDon\u2019t Make the Wrong Call With High-End Smartphones\n\u201cWhile the allure of the latest smartphone model is strong, these devices can be incredibly expensive,\u201d Godur said. \u201cOpting for a model that\u2019s one or two generations older can still provide excellent functionality at a fraction of the cost.\u201d\nBuy Generic and Skip Brand-Name\nShopping for groceries \u2014 or medications \u2014 can quickly become expensive when opting for brand-name products.\n\u201cMany store-brand items are nearly identical in quality but are significantly cheaper,\u201d Godur said. This simple switch can save a noticeable amount each month without sacrificing quality.\nSkip Gym Memberships That Aren\u2019t Working Out\n\u201cGym memberships are beneficial, but often underutilized,\u201d Godur said. \u201cConsidering the cost, it\u2019s practical to switch to cost-effective or free alternatives like outdoor exercises, community sports groups or even online workout classes that are much cheaper or free.\u201d\nShirshikov shared a similar view, saying many people pay for memberships they rarely use. But he also advised that when the weather permits outdoor activities like running, biking or hiking, those in the middle class should explore home workout routines or local community centers with lower fees.\n\u201cThis can be an effective way to stay fit without the high costs,\u201d he said.\nDitch Your Daily Coffee Purchase\nThis last tip is arguably a bit tired, but it doesn\u2019t make it any less true.\n\u201cA daily coffee purchase at high-end cafes can quietly drain your wallet,\u201d Godur said. \u201cInvesting in a good coffee maker at home can dramatically cut down your monthly expenses and you might find you enjoy the taste of your home brew just as much.\u201d\nAt the very least, just try to cut down on your Starbucks trips, and you could find yourself with an extra $100 in our savings account every month."

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nBernadette Joy, a financial coach and self-made millionaire, believes that in order to start building the money habits required to gain wealth, you first need to break the bad habits that are causing you to lose money. You could be guilty of many of these habits without even realizing the toll they are taking on your financial health \u2014 but it is possible to break them.\nAccording to Joy, here are the biggest mistakes that are causing you to lose money.\nComparing Yourself to Others\nWe are all guilty of wishing our lifestyle looked more like what we see on Instagram \u2014 but making these comparisons is a mistake.\n\u201cOne of the biggest money mistakes [is] basing your financial goals on what you think other people are doing,\u201d Joy told GOBankingRates. \u201cSocial media makes it easy to compare your finances to someone else\u2019s highlight reel \u2014 whether it\u2019s vacations, new cars or luxury purchases.\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t see their bank statements or credit card debt,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis is exactly why I advocate for \u2018Screenless Sundays\u2019 in my book. Take a break from the noise and focus on what you actually want your money to do for you.\u201d\nTackling Too Many Financial Goals at Once\nIn her book, \u201cCrush Your Money Goals,\u201d Joy said that another common mistake is trying to juggle too many financial goals at one time.\n\u201cJuggling too many goals is a recipe for feeling overwhelmed and slowing down your overall financial progress,\u201d she wrote.\nInstead of trying to build an emergency fund, pay off debt, set aside money for your kid\u2019s college fund and save money to buy a new car all at once, prioritize your goals and focus on one at a time.\n\u201cRather than think of all your money goals as separate entities, think of them as milestones that need to be in priority order,\u201d Joy wrote. \u201cFinish one milestone, then move onto the next. Not only will you get there faster, but you will also enjoy yourself along the way.\u201d\nGiving Out Things for Free\nMany of us are guilty of \u201cgiving out discounts nobody asked for,\u201d Joy wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s time to put an end to this habit that is literally costing you thousands.\u201d\nThis habit can look different in different scenarios. It can mean undercharging people for your services, accepting less pay than you are qualified for, overdelivering at work without getting additional compensation, saying \u201cyes\u201d too often, taking on trivial tasks that don\u2019t pay as well as more meaningful work or accepting burnout as a part of life.\n\u201cStop giving discounts on your time, energy and mental well-being,\u201d Joy wrote. \u201cYour net worth and self-worth will grow by leaps and bounds if you value your life accordingly.\u201d\nBeing in Debt Long Term\nMany of us will find ourselves in debt at some point in our lives, whether we have student loans hanging over our heads or credit card bills that we can\u2019t pay in full. Although having debt is common, you should not accept being in debt as a long-term way of life, Joy wrote.\n\u201cRelying on debt to get you through challenging times doesn\u2019t need to be your default habit,\u201d she wrote. \u201cPaying for big purchases outright will absolutely change the way you manage your money forever.\u201d\nIf you do have to take on debt, make sure you give yourself a deadline for paying it off in full.\n\u201cDebt keeps you living in the past,\u201d Joy wrote. \u201cStarting now, think of debt as a last resort, not the first option you turn to when a financial challenge comes your way.\u201d\nLetting Fear Guide Your Money Choices\nThe final bad habit Joy outlines in her book is being guided by fear rather than freedom when it comes to your money choices.\n\u201cIf you find yourself hesitating and second-guessing financial choices, fear is probably dictating how you manage your money,\u201d Joy wrote.\nSome of the most common money-related fears Joy has seen among her financial coaching clients are fear of judgment from friends and family, fear of losing money, fear of failure and even fear of success.\n\u201cI learned that success has a high price for many people who are afraid to leave family and friends behind,\u201d Joy wrote.\nOnce you\u2019ve identified your money fears, you can start facing them head on.\n\u201cThe one thing that I ask you to do is to choose to fight these fears,\u201d Joy wrote. \u201cIt simply means acting intentionally and thoughtfully when your first instinct might instead be to flee, freeze, fawn or freak out.\u201d"

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nInvesting in the stock market is one of the best ways to create wealth over time. If you\u2019ve never invested, all the names and numbers you hear in the news about stocks might seem like gibberish. But with some research, you can unlock the meaning behind confusing stock terms and learn just how important \u2014 and easy \u2014 it is to begin investing, regardless of how much money you have.\nYour investments should be separate from your savings or emergency accounts. Reserve the latter for short-term goals and unexpected debt. Your investments should be for long-term goals, such as retirement.\n1. Figure Out Your Risk Tolerance and Investing Goals\nYour investing goals and risk tolerance will help you decide which stocks to buy and at what price. Consider what you want to do with your money: purchase real estate, produce income, maximize capital appreciation, etc. Then, figure out how much time you have to meet your goals.\nRisk tolerance refers to how much money you\u2019re willing to lose on an investment in exchange for the potential of greater gains. The stock market is unpredictable, so your risk tolerance decreases with time. Someone who plans to retire in 35 years has more time to recover from a dip in stock prices than someone who has five years until retirement.\nOnce you\u2019ve considered your financial situation, your risk tolerance and the amount of money you\u2019re willing to invest, decide how you want to invest.\n2. Decide What Kind of Investor You Are\nThere are two primary categories of investors: hands-on and passive.\nHands-On Investor\nA hands-on investor builds a portfolio by choosing investments either alone or with a financial advisor\u2019s help. This option offers more control over the portfolio\u2019s structure and appeals to individuals looking to maximize gains. It is also more time-consuming for the person who has to research the available investment choices.\nPassive Investor\nPassive investors don\u2019t choose individual stocks. Instead, they match the performance of specific market indexes like the S&P 500 or Dow Jones Industrial Average. This approach tends to lessen volatility and provide a more stable return over time, but it comes with less growth potential.\n3. Decide Where To Open a Brokerage Account\nInvestors can open a brokerage account in any of several places, including traditional and online brokerage firms such as Charles Schwab, Fidelity and Robinhood.\nFull-Service Broker\nFull-service brokers provide a wide range of services and professional guidance for nervous or inexperienced investors. For example, a full-service broker offers investment advice, makes stock recommendations and provides access to initial public offerings. They might also offer financial planning and wealth/asset management services, sell insurance and provide banking services. In exchange for this high level of service, you\u2019ll have to pay commission and other fees.\nExamples of full-service brokers include Merrill, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.\nDiscount Broker\nDiscount brokers provide fewer services than full-service brokers do. Although they don\u2019t offer investment advice, for a fee they can execute trades on your behalf \u2014 or you can execute your own online trades from a self-directed investment account using the brokerage\u2019s online trading platform. The benefit of a discount broker is that you\u2019ll pay lower fees and might trade commission-free.\nFidelity and Schwab are two of the best-known discount brokers. Robinhood, which facilitates trades through its popular mobile app, is also a discount broker. There\u2019s no charge to open an account, and trade minimums are just a few dollars.\nRobo-Advisor\nA robo-advisor automates your investments. It\u2019s a fully online process that begins with the platform asking you a series of questions about your budget, your investment priorities and goals, and how often you want to invest. Once you\u2019ve set up your account and added a payment method, the robo-advisor selects a portfolio of stocks on your behalf and continues to make investments according to the schedule you set.\nSome discount brokers, such as Fidelity and Schwab, have a robo-advisor. Other robo-advisors include Betterment and Acorns.\n4. Open a Brokerage Account\nOpening a brokerage account is just as easy as opening a checking or savings account.\nTo open an account with a full-service broker, you can schedule an appointment to speak with an advisor in person. The advisor can help walk you through the different account options available to decide what\u2019s best for you.\nTo open a brokerage account online, visit the brokerage\u2019s website and complete the online application.\nYou\u2019ll have to provide the following personal information:\n- Name\n- Social Security number\n- Driver\u2019s license or passport information\n- Employment status\n- Contact information\n- Additional financial information, such as your bank\u2019s name and your bank account number\nIn addition to providing personal information, you will also need to answer questions about the type of account you want and how you plan to manage it.\n5. Start Early\nThe best way to succeed as a beginning investor is simply to start early. The earlier you begin investing, the more time you have for your returns to compound \u2014 and this can be the single biggest contributor to your long-term success.\nTake, for example, the case of an investor who begins investing $300 per month at age 20 and earns a 7% annual return until age 65. At that point, the investor\u2019s account value will be approximately $1.14 million. But if someone waited until age 30 to begin investing that $300 per month, even if they earned a 9% annual return \u2014 a significant boost \u2014 they\u2019d still only have about $882,000. The point is that even with a portfolio that earns less money, starting early can result in a larger ultimate account value.\n6. Decide Whether To Invest In Stocks or Stock Funds\nPurchasing individual stocks isn\u2019t the only way to invest. Investors can also buy shares of mutual funds or exchange-traded funds. Funds are a great way for beginning investors to get their feet wet because they take some of the guesswork out of building a portfolio.\nHere\u2019s a closer look at all three options:\nIndividual Stocks\nIndividual stocks give you the most control and flexibility over your portfolio. You can invest in any publicly traded company you want, and buy as few or as many shares as you want \u2014 or simply invest a few dollars in fractional shares if your budget is tight.\nThe benefit of investing in individual stocks is the opportunity for significant growth if the stocks you pick turn out to be winners. The downside is risk. Stock markets are volatile and unpredictable, and the information needed to make good choices can be hard to digest. That\u2019s why you should never invest more than you can afford to lose.\nMutual Fund\nA mutual fund pools money from many investors to create a portfolio of stocks and other equities. The funds are professionally managed, but you don\u2019t need a full-service broker to buy shares in one \u2014 you can do your own trades on your broker\u2019s trading platform or app.\nThere are several types of mutual funds to choose from:\n- Actively managed fund: The fund manager buys and sells securities with the goal of outperforming the market or a segment of the market.\n- Index fund: The fund tracks a certain benchmark index, such as the S&P 500, by investing in the securities included in the index or by investing in comparable securities to replicate the index\u2019s returns.\n- Target-date fund: The fund invests in a selection of securities that changes as the target date approaches. The target date usually refers to a retirement date, so the mix of securities becomes more conservative as time goes on.\nThe primary benefit of a mutual fund is its diversity \u2014 chances are that at least some of the fund\u2019s holdings will perform well, even during down times. However, mutual funds have management and other fees, and you can\u2019t trade them instantly like you can stocks. Trades are executed at the end of the day, for whatever the price is at that time. The minimum investment is usually $1,000 for index funds and $3,000 for actively managed funds.\nExchange-Traded Fund\nETFs pool money from many investors just like mutual funds do, but ETFs trade like stocks. ETF prices, like stock prices, change throughout the day. You can purchase full shares or fractional shares. As long as you place buy and sell orders when markets are open, your trades are executed immediately.\nWhich Is the Best Option for Beginning Investors?\nThe truth is that most beginning investors shouldn\u2019t consider investing significant amounts into individual stocks. As mutual funds and ETFs can provide instant diversification, particularly to a small portfolio, they are usually the best options to consider for beginning investors. As portfolios grow and investors build more knowledge, they can consider investing in individual stocks if they\u2019re willing to put in the time and effort to research stocks that match their investment objectives and risk tolerances.\n7. Manage and Diversify Your Portfolio for Long-Term Success\nThe key to success as an investor depends on your ability to lessen the risk by researching the investments that best meet your needs, diversifying your portfolio and keeping track of its performance.\nHere\u2019s how:\n- Choose a mixture of stocks, bonds and other short-term investments that match your investment goals and risk tolerance.\n- Meet with a financial advisor regularly, such as every six to 12 months, to review and evaluate your investments\u2019 performance.\n- Rebalance your portfolio as needed by selling investments in over-weighted categories and buying investments in under-weighted categories.\n- Change your asset allocation as you get closer to retirement if you\u2019re falling short of your financial goal.\nStock prices will rise and fall in reaction to factors you cannot control. But taking steps to manage your portfolio \u2014 either on your own or with assistance \u2014 can help you reach your financial goals.\n8. Consider Your Finances Over the Long Term\nEven if you seek a financial planner\u2019s advice, you make the ultimate decisions about your investments. Avoid making rapid investment decisions without considering how they fit into your bigger plans. Here\u2019s what you can do to get started:\nSet a Budget and Stick To It\nYou have to treat your investment money the same way as you do your bills, like your mortgage, rent or utilities. Force yourself to pay this \u201cbill\u201d every single month. Most advisors suggest that you \u201cpay yourself first\u201d by putting money into your investments before you even pay your other bills. This way, you won\u2019t get caught trying to invest whatever money is left over after you pay your bills and spend your discretionary income, which is a trap many people fall into.\nDiscuss Plans With a Financial Advisor\nA financial advisor can discuss investment options with you and help you determine what\u2019s best for your situation. A licensed professional can help you drill down and discover what your real investment objectives and risk tolerance are. Advisors can also provide emotionless counsel during times of market sell-offs.\nFocus on Long-Term Growth Instead of Short-Term Gains\nKeeping an investment for an extended period can save you money in transaction fees and capital gains taxes. As long as you\u2019re investing in a solid company, the investment will likely increase in value over time. As famed billionaire investor Warren Buffett has often said, \u201cOur favorite holding period is forever,\u201d meaning that once you pick the right stocks, you should sit back and let them do the work for you, rather than trying to trade in and out and time the market.\nAutomate Your Investments\nInvesting is not a one-and-done process. Rather, it\u2019s something you should do on a regular basis. Getting in the habit of saving 20%, 15%, 10% or even 5% of your income on a monthly basis is one of the cornerstones of long-term investment success, and the best way to do this is to automate your investments.\nNot only will you be continually pumping up the value of your account, but you\u2019ll be taking emotion out of the equation. It\u2019s human nature to avoid investing in stocks or other investments when they are down sharply in price, but that\u2019s the best time to pick up additional shares, when they are cheap. Automated investing helps keep you in the market and continually builds up your account value.\nFAQ on Investing In Stocks\nFor the new investor, investing in the stock market can be an overwhelming experience. Here are some frequently asked questions tailored to new investors.- What should you consider before investing in stocks?\n- Before you decide to invest in stocks, it's helpful to have a basic financial education, including understanding the following broad topics:\n- Banking and budgeting\n- Credit and debt\n- Income planning\n- Risk management\n- You may want to wait until you have paid off your debt and have an emergency fund in place before investing in stocks. Using disposable income or income you've specifically dedicated for investing can help you avoid financial ruin if the stocks don't perform how you expected.\n- Before you decide to invest in stocks, it's helpful to have a basic financial education, including understanding the following broad topics:\n- Can you lose money if you invest in stocks?\n- Yes, you can lose money if you invest in stocks.

Many of them say they apply this same train of thought and analysis in picking winning stocks \u2014 stocks they will never be selling.\nGOBankingRates spoke to a few of them who explained why they won\u2019t let go of these five stocks \u2014 and why you shouldn\u2019t either.\nApple\n- Stock price year range: $164.08 to $237.49\n- Market cap: $3.59 trillion\nJoe Camberato, the CEO of National Business Capital, became a self-made millionaire in his 30s thanks to hard work as an entrepreneur founding a fintech lending platform, as well as numerous other companies and investments. For him, a stock he will never sell is Apple.\n\u201cApple is an extraordinary company that has become deeply rooted in our lives. With a massive fan base and a consistent track record of innovation, Apple has established itself as one of the world\u2019s finest companies \u2014 a true profit-generating machine,\u201d he said.\nHe added, \u201cIn my view, the best is yet to come for Apple. Also, the fact that it pays dividends allows me to reinvest them and buy more shares, and that strengthens my position.\u201d\nVanguard Small-Cap Index Fund ETF\n- Stock price year range: $181.00 to $242.97\n- Market cap: $39 billion\nRegarding the Vanguard index funds, Camberato said they provide a convenient avenue for diversifying across the top companies in the S&P 500, as well as high-growth potential stocks in the growth and small cap index funds.\n\u201cThese indexes have demonstrated remarkable long-term growth and consistently pay dividends,\u201d he said. \u201cBy looking at how they performed historically, stretching back to the 1920s, it\u2019s clear that the S&P has endured periods of pullbacks, but ultimately they continued to thrive, generating impressive returns over time. It would go against logic to sell these index funds.\u201d\nIn addition, he noted that even during market crashes, his strategy would be to continue monthly investments in the indexes, and possibly even increase the amount during downturns.\n\u201cSelling these stocks would mean selling myself short and missing out on their long-term potential,\u201d he added.\nTesla\n- Stock price year range: $138.80 to $273.54\n- Market cap: $681.9 billion\nAnna Koval is a self-made millionaire who co-founded Tarotoo, an online tarot reading platform. She said that one of the most important lessons she learned is to invest in what you know and love.\n\u201cFor me, that means investing in companies that are aligned with my values, passions, and vision for the future,\u201d Koval said. Hence, she won\u2019t be selling Tesla, which she believes \u201cis not just a car company.\u201d\nShe explained, \u201cIt\u2019s a pioneer in clean energy, autonomous driving and battery technology. I admire how Tesla challenges the status quo and pushes the boundaries of what\u2019s possible. I own a Tesla Model 3 and I love it. It\u2019s the best car I\u2019ve ever driven. I believe Tesla has a lot of growth potential and will continue to revolutionize the world for the better.\u201d\nShopify\n- Stock price year range: $48.56 to $91.57\n- Market cap: $105.3 billion\nShopify is another stock Koval won\u2019t sell.\n\u201cOnce again, Shopify is not just a platform for online stores. It\u2019s a partner for entrepreneurs, creators, and innovators,\u201d she said. \u201cI admire how Shopify empowers millions of people to start and grow their own businesses online. I use Shopify to run Tarotoo\u2019s website and e-commerce operations. It\u2019s easy, reliable, and scalable. I believe Shopify has a lot of growth potential and will continue to support the future of commerce.\u201d\nAmazon\n- Stock price year range: $138.36 to $201.20\n- Market cap: $1.99 trillion\nCasey Jones, founder and head of finance at global digital marketing agency CJ&CO, said that as a self-made millionaire and a seasoned investor, he has learned that the key to building wealth is patience, diversification and investing in companies that have a proven track record and a clear vision for the future. In turn, that\u2019s why he has decided to never sell Amazon.\nFirst, Jones said that Amazon is a diversified technology giant with a leading market share in multiple industries, including e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising and artificial intelligence. \u201cThis diversification provides a level of stability and growth potential that is hard to find in other companies.\u201d\nIn addition, he said Amazon has shown resilience and growth potential despite facing challenges in recent years. \u201cThe company\u2019s stock has experienced significant declines in the past but has managed to recover and continue growing. This resilience is a testament to Amazon\u2019s strong business model and its ability to adapt to changing market conditions.\u201d\nFinally, he said that the long-term growth prospects for Amazon remain strong due to its innovative approach and ability to adapt to changing market conditions. \u201cThe company\u2019s continuous investment in new technologies and sectors, such as artificial intelligence and healthcare, positions it well for future growth.\u201d\nAs of today, his initial investment of 1,000 AUD ($685) in Amazon has grown significantly. Jones noted, however, that it\u2019s important to remember that investing in stocks always carries risks. \u201cIndividual investors should carefully consider their financial goals and risk tolerance before making any investment decisions.\u201d\nPrices are accurate as of Nov. 5, 2024."

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nThe stock market can be a solid investment plan \u2014 if it\u2019s done well. With ups and downs in the market like we\u2019ve seen this year, new investors might view stocks as risky bets. It\u2019s imperative to stick to a plan that\u2019s going to weather stock declines.\nHere\u2019s what ChatGPT recommended doing in times of stock market volatility.\nFocus On Dividend Stocks\nDividend stocks regularly pay out a set amount to shareholders. Even when the market wavers, investors will likely still receive a piece of the pie.\nChatGPT suggested investing in dividend stocks via the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM). ChatGPT added that reinvesting dividend money into the stock is a smart move that also steels you against market dips.\nTry Dollar-Cost Averaging\nAnother method ChatGPT recommended was dollar-cost averaging. To do this, set up your bank account to invest a set amount of cash into the stock market on a regular basis.\nUsing this method, ChatGPT pointed out that \u201cyou buy more shares when prices are low and fewer when prices are high, averaging out your cost and reducing the stress of timing the market.\u201d\nExplore Advanced Options\nFor those who already know a fair amount about the stock market and feel more comfortable, ChatGPT recommended two courses of action.\nOne is to sell covered calls, which means you set a price (known as the strike price) and a time frame to sell your stock to an investor at that price. In exchange, you\u2019ll earn a premium. This is a good way to earn money on stocks you own \u2014 especially in stocks that don\u2019t fall or rise very much. Know that you have to own 100 shares per contract, and that you must sell the stock at the price you set. This means if it goes above that price, since you sold it already, you won\u2019t benefit from that gain.\nAnother advanced option ChatGPT suggested is selling cash-secured puts. \u201cHere, you don\u2019t own the stock yet. Instead, you agree to buy it at a lower price if it falls to that level within a specific time frame. You\u2019re paid a premium for making that agreement,\u201d ChatGPT explained. You\u2019ll need to have enough capital on hand to buy 100 shares.\nExpand Investments\nLooking outside of the stock market is also a possibility.\nChatGPT suggested gold bonds and real estate as alternatives to investing in the stock market. This way, your portfolio is more diversified so your income doesn\u2019t depend solely on one investment strategy.\nUse High-Interest Savings or CDs\nHigh-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) can feel safer than the stock market because there\u2019s no real risk of loss. Storing cash in a high-interest savings account means your money grows as long as it\u2019s in the account. Similarly, CDs will grow at a set rate after a predetermined amount of time, so you know exactly how much money you\u2019ll get out of your investment.\nMore From GOBankingRates"

      "text": "The New Era of Meme Stock Investing: How AI and Short-Interest Analytics Are Reshaping Retail-Driven Rallies\nIn 2025, the meme stock phenomenon has evolved from a chaotic, FOMO-driven spectacle into a calculated, data-informed game. No longer reliant on viral tweets or impulsive buying, today's retail-driven rallies are orchestrated using AI-driven sentiment analysis and real-time short-interest analytics. For investors, this shift presents both unprecedented opportunities and heightened risks. Understanding how these tools work\u2014and how to leverage them strategically\u2014is key to navigating the next wave of speculative surges.\nThe Rise of AI-Driven Sentiment Analysis\nRetail investors now wield tools that rival institutional capabilities. Platforms like Quiver Quantitative and AltIndex aggregate social media chatter, options volume, and sentiment scores in real time. For example, Krispy Kreme (DNUT) surged 90% in pre-market trading in July 2025 after AI algorithms detected a 500% spike in Stocktwits and Reddit mentions. These tools quantify sentiment shifts, identifying stocks where hype is transitioning from noise to actionable momentum.\nAI models trained on Reddit threads and X (formerly Twitter) can even predict retail consensus before price movements materialize. A viral post about Kohl's (KSS) rebranding as a \u201creal estate play\u201d was flagged by sentiment tools hours before the stock's 90% single-day rally in June 2025. This feedback loop\u2014where algorithms amplify narratives, which in turn drive buying\u2014has transformed meme stocks into a form of speculative warfare.\nShort-Interest Analytics: The Fuel for Short Squeezes\nHigh short interest remains a critical catalyst for meme stock surges. Stocks like KSS (49% short float) and Opendoor (OPEN) (44% short float) became prime targets in 2025. Retail investors use platforms like Nasdaq's short interest reports to identify vulnerable stocks, often coordinating buying efforts to force short sellers into covering positions. For instance, OPEN's 440% surge in July 2025 was driven by a 1,700% spike in trading volume\u2014a direct result of short-covering and algorithmic coordination.\nShort-interest analytics also help investors time exits. When sentiment diverges from technical indicators\u2014such as declining volume during a rally\u2014it signals overbought conditions. This was evident in DNUT's rapid reversal after its 90% surge, as institutions pivoted to contrarian bets using sentiment data.\nCase Study: The 2025 Meme Stock Playbook\n- Krispy Kreme (DNUT): A 32.2% short float and viral Reddit threads fueled a 90% pre-market jump in July 2025. AI sentiment tools flagged the surge in chatter about \u201cunlocking real estate value,\u201d which traders weaponized to trigger a short squeeze.\n- Kohl's (KSS): A 49% short float and coordinated buying on r/WallStreetBets drove a 90% single-day rally in June 2025. Retail investors leveraged AI to identify the stock as a high-probability short-squeeze candidate.\n- GoPro (GPRO): A 9\u201310% short float and a viral Reddit post led to a 30% surge in a single day, demonstrating how sentiment and short interest can align for explosive gains.\nStrategic Considerations for Investors\n- Combine Sentiment and Short-Interest Data: Use platforms like Quiver Quantitative to identify stocks with rising social media chatter and high short floats. For example, AppLovin (APP) saw consistent 40% YoY growth flagged by AI, making it a \u201cno-name\u201d stock with speculative potential.\n- Hedge for Volatility: Institutions now use bear call spreads and protective puts to mitigate short-squeeze risks. Retail investors should consider options strategies like long puts to cap downside risk in volatile meme stocks.\n- Monitor Regulatory Shifts: A proposed two-stage alert system for coordinated retail activity could disrupt meme stock dynamics. Stay informed about regulatory developments, as they may force short sellers to unwind positions abruptly.\nThe Risks of Overconfidence\nWhile AI tools provide clarity, they also amplify behavioral biases. A 2024 academic study found that 75% of retail investors in meme stocks lost money, often due to emotional decision-making and survivorship bias. Meme stocks thrive on momentum, but fundamentals rarely justify valuations. Kohl's (KSS) Q1 2025 revenue declined 4.1% YoY, yet its stock soared due to narrative-driven speculation.\nFor investors, the key is to balance participation with discipline. Use AI to identify opportunities, but exit before sentiment peaks. As one analyst noted, \u201cThe market now trades on sentiment rather than sense\u2014but sentiment can vanish as quickly as it arrives.\u201d\nConclusion: Navigating the New Normal\nThe 2025 meme stock cycle underscores a paradigm shift in financial markets. AI-driven sentiment analysis and short-interest analytics have democratized speculative trading, but they also introduce new complexities. For investors, success lies in leveraging these tools to identify high-probability candidates while maintaining a disciplined exit strategy.\nIn this new era, the line between opportunity and peril is razor-thin. Meme stocks are no longer a niche phenomenon\u2014they are a reflection of a market where retail sentiment and algorithmic coordination can rival traditional fundamentals. For those willing to adapt, the rewards are substantial\u2014but so are the risks.\nComments\nNo comments yet"

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nFrom stock bots to ChatGPT prompts, artificial intelligence (AI) is not only here to stay, but it\u2019s making its way into aspects of people\u2019s lives where it once might have seemed impossible: investing. While you probably shouldn\u2019t fire your broker or let AI make all of your investing decisions, there are some good uses for it.\nAI is especially useful if you think of it as a tool to support and supplement your investments but not to replace professional advice or other practical expertise.\nHere are four ways to use AI for investing that are not only useful but actually quite smart.\nUse AI To Automate Your Portfolio\nAutomated, AI-driven online advisors (\u201crobo-advisors\u201d) may not be able to give you a nuanced overview of your specific portfolio, but they can help you make some basic decisions including how to generally allocate assets, how to rebalance a portfolio or how to minimize your tax impact.\nFrom Fidelity Go to Betterment, there are many finance-based robo-advisors available to set you up with information that can help you assess and even automate aspects of your portfolio. You don\u2019t, however, want to make any big changes without first running them by a financial professional.\nUse for Investing Research, but Always Fact Check\nOne of the best uses of AI in investing is to help educate yourself, whether to define terms (dollar-cost averaging, anyone?), understand general market trends (\u201cWhat\u2019s a bull market?\u201d) or summarize lengthy financial information (a company\u2019s earnings call).\nTools like Morningstar\u2019s Mo or Finchat.io offer AI-generated answers to users\u2019 financial questions. Grounding yourself in financial terms is a great starting point for becoming a smarter investment.\nHowever, always fact check information you get from AI before you use it in any significant way. It\u2019s one thing to toss around a new investing term you learned at a party, another thing to reallocate your portfolio because AI told you to.\nUse To Spot Trends, but Not Predict the Future\nAI is a pattern-finding and analyzing dynamo, able to process millions of data points and detect trends at amazing speeds that humans might miss. However, picking out trends does not mean it can predict the future. In fact, it\u2019s notoriously bad at this, because it turns out that being able to pick a hot stock is a uniquely human trait, borne of things like instinct and experience and history as well as the trends and patterns that AI can find.\nThis lends itself best to long-term investing strategies versus day-trading hype.\nUse for Risk Management\nOne of the smartest ways to use AI in your investing strategy is for risk management, making sure you\u2019re not over-concentrated in one asset, especially a risky one. AI can take a high-level overview of your portfolio and flag potential red flags that you can either solve on your own or seek a professional\u2019s help with.\nAdditionally, you can use AI to track your investments against market conditions to help you resist emotional decision-making \u2014 like chasing trends or holding on to underperforming assets too long. It can help you become a more strategic investor.\nAvoid AI Investing Mistakes\nYou can\u2019t call your friends a tool \u2014 it\u2019s an insult \u2014 but AI won\u2019t be offended, because it is a tool. A helpful tool to fill in when you don\u2019t have a finance professional at your fingertips. Don\u2019t blindly follow AI stock picks or investing bots. All AI gives incorrect or even made up (hallucinated) information at times.\nThink of AI as your investing assistant, one whose work still needs checking. While it won\u2019t replace a finance professional, it can assist you in your investing goals."

      "text": "Suze Orman: 3 Biggest Mistakes You Can Make as an Investor\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nMost people know this investing advice: Buy low, sell high. And while it sounds simple, it\u2019s actually very difficult to do. Many invest with the best intentions, hoping their money will make money without them lifting a finger. However, many end up losing money instead.\nPersonal finance expert and New York Times bestselling author, Suze Orman addressed the challenges of being an investor on her podcast. In a recent episode called \u201cSuze School: The Biggest Mistakes You Make as an Investor,\u201d Orman shared some advice to help you get your investments in order.\nGiving in to Fear\nInvesting can be scary, especially if you\u2019re putting a lot of money into a stock.\nConsider this: Maybe you do research and find an outstanding stock. You consider buying some shares, but because of the risk, you decide not to invest. A short time later, the stock takes off just as you\u2019d predicted, and you\u2019re left kicking yourself because you missed your chance.\nOrman says the biggest investing mistake you can make is making decisions based on fear. During her time as a stockbroker, she found that her clients fit into two categories: those that invest and hold no matter what happens, and others that invest and sell at the slightest dip in price.\nInvestors who give in to fear suffer from what\u2019s known as myopic loss aversion (MLA). MLA is also known as an investor\u2019s tendency to focus more on the short-term outcomes of a stock rather than the long-term benefit. As Orman observed, MLA often leads to selling investments too soon and losing out on potential profits.\nDALBAR\u2019s Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior (QAIB) found that investors with $100,000 who bought and held S&P 500 throughout 2023 would earn $26,288 and have a total of $126,288 at the year\u2019s end.\nBut to do this, investors must hold their investment through multiple dips. Orman found that her clients who held the stocks because they were confident in their selections made much more money on average than those who sold due to fear.\nOne way to avoid giving in to fear is by reframing risk. Try viewing risk as a potentially rewarding part of your journey instead of a potential loss. Recognizing and transforming your fear can help you hold your investments and gain more profits in the long run.\nFocusing on What You Had\nWhen investing, it\u2019s essential to focus the present. Thinking too much about what you had before instead of what you have now can skew your perspective.\nIf you buy into a stock at $10 and it raises to $50, you\u2019ll have a lot of profits and will be very happy with your decisions. If that stock drops from $50 to $20, you, like many investors, might feel like you lost money.\nBut on the other hand, you haven\u2019t really lost $30 per share. You\u2019ve still gained $10 per share.\nOrman explains that investors should never look at the gains they once had and consider them losses. You must compare your stock values to the price point you bought them at.\nMaking decisions based on your gains instead of your phantom losses will lead to more success.\nNot Using Dollar-Cost Averaging\nWhen you invest, the value doesn\u2019t always increase. The price will often drop, and if you\u2019ve invested all of your money already, you will miss out on an opportunity.\nFor example, you put all of your money into a stock that\u2019s $50 per share, but it begins to drop. Because you\u2019ve invested everything you had as a lump sum, you are losing money and missing an opportunity to buy that stock at a lower price.\nMany people think they need to invest all of the money they\u2019ve set aside right away. According to Orman, this is a huge mistake. Dollar cost averaging is her most important investment rule.\nDollar cost averaging is an investment strategy where you invest a fixed amount in regular intervals instead of everything at once. By doing this, you can take advantage of price dips to buy more shares of a stock with the same amount of money.\nFidelity showed how this works with $5,000. When all $5,000 was invested in a lump sum of stock worth $20, it resulted in 250 shares. Then the same $5,000 was spread out in fixed investments over 5 months, with the stock price fluctuating between $18 and $21. This resulted in 253.4 shares due to dollar cost averaging as opposed to 250 shares from lump-sum investing.\nYou can get more from your money if you\u2019re patient and willing to take your time. Ultimately, waiting for the right opportunity tends to pay off."

      "text": "What Makes a Stock Go Up? A Guide for Beginners\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nStock prices go up and down based on supply and demand. When people want to buy a stock versus sell it, the price goes up. If people want to sell a stock versus buy it, the price goes down.\nTrying to forecast whether there will be more buyers or sellers of a certain stock over the short term is difficult, if not impossible. Over the long term, however, you\u2019ll have a better chance of picking winning stocks if you do your research. Buyers are attracted to stocks for any number of reasons, from low valuation to new product lines to market hype.\nLearning how the stock exchange works is the first step in understanding what makes a stock go up and down. You can better predict which ones are more likely to rise.\nSupply and Demand in the Stock Market\nA stock is an ownership share in a company. Stock shares allow investors to buy or sell an interest in a company on an exchange through a bidding process. Sellers indicate prices at which they are asking to give up their shares, and buyers similarly post prices at which they\u2019re bidding to buy shares. This is known as the bid-ask spread.\nSupply refers to the number of investors willing to sell their shares. Demand refers to the number of investors willing to buy shares. When more buyers are willing to pay the sellers\u2019 asking price than what\u2019s available, the stock price will go up to the next level at which sellers are asking. Here\u2019s an example of how supply and demand work in the market:\nExample of Supply and Demand\nBuyers\n- Investor A offers $10 to buy a stock.\n- Investor B offers $10.10 to buy a stock.\n- Investor C offers $10.20 to buy a stock.\nSellers\n- Investor D asks $10.10 to sell the stock.\n- The first published trade occurs at $10.10, when Investor B buys from Investor D.\n- Investor E asks $10.20 to sell the stock.\n- This trade occurs when Investor C enters the market and pays $10.20.\nThis shows how investor demand can drive up the price of a stock. After the first trade at $10.10, no more sellers are willing to accept such a low price. The next trade occurs at $10.20, as the demand to pay a higher price exceeds the willingness of sellers to accept a lower price.\nCompany Performance and Fundamentals\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of the different ways you can gauge a stock\u2019s value.\nEarnings Per Share\nEarnings per share are one of the most popular ways to evaluate the value of a stock. Stocks with higher earnings, particularly when they are consistently growing, are simply worth more.\nImagine, for example, that a company earns $5 per share in 2024 and is expected to earn $6 per share in 2025 and $7 per share in 2026. This represents an annual growth rate of roughly 17% to 20% per year. In most industries, this is a very high growth rate and investors tend to pay a premium for fast-growing stocks.\nCompare this with a second company that earns $2 in 2024 and is projected to earn just $1 in 2025 and $1.50 in 2026. All other things being equal, the valuation of the first company should greatly exceed that of the second company, as investors are more interested in companies with rising earnings and growing revenue. Positive earnings reports boost investor confidence.\nP/E Ratio\nThe P/E ratio is another metric for comparison that investors use to value stocks. The P/E ratio simply consists of a stock price divided by its EPS. If Company A\u2019s stock price is $50 and its EPS is $1, its P/E ratio is 50. If Company B\u2019s stock price is $50 and its EPS is 50 cents, its P/E ratio is 100.\nIn other words, a company with a lower P/E than another within the same industry may be more attractive to investors, as it can be considered undervalued. However, as an investor, you should factor in all variables when valuing stocks, not just the P/E ratio. Some companies, for example, have very low P/E ratios because they are failing companies with missing earnings or losses. Buying stocks like these can be more of a speculation than an investment.\nMarket Sentiment and Investor Confidence\nAlthough earnings drive stock prices over the long run, there\u2019s no denying that over the short run, emotions can rule.\nRumors and Market Volatility\nRumors influence perception and can create market volatility as investors try to get in or out of positions before the masses.\nCorporate News\nHowever, actual corporate news can also influence investor confidence, pushing a stock up or down. If a company is expected to bring a new product to market in the second quarter of a given year but then announces that it won\u2019t be ready until the fourth quarter, some investors might sell, either disappointed at the delay or concerned that the company can\u2019t meet its deadlines.\nAnalyst Reports\nAnalyst upgrades or downgrades can also impact demand. As analysts are presumed to have access to more information than the average investor, when they publish reports or give interviews on CNBC, stocks tend to move. As with corporate news or even internet rumors, if investors start to lose confidence in a company, market sentiment can turn sour, and vice versa.\nIndustry Trends and Economic Factors\nAny economic factors that can hurt corporate earnings can also reduce stock prices.\nInflation\nHistorically speaking, high inflation has tended to drive stock prices lower. This is because inflation causes higher prices, which makes it more expensive to run a business.\nHigh Interest Rates\nThe same is true with higher interest rates, which often occur during times of high inflation. Larger, widespread events affect specific industries instead of the market overall, such as when a presidential administration slaps tariffs on particular goods or companies.\nGross Domestic Product\nGross domestic product can also play a role. If the economy as a whole is expanding, it means that many individual companies, which comprise an important portion of the nation\u2019s GDP, are growing as well. This type of positive macroeconomic news can get more investors interested in picking up shares of stock.\nSimilarly, if an individual market sector is performing well, it can have a direct influence on other stocks in the same industry. If three major consumer goods companies report better-than-expected earnings, for example, investors are likely to buy shares of other companies in the industry as they expect them to outperform as well.\nMomentum Investing\nSometimes, stocks go up simply because they have been going up. In a strategy known as momentum investing, investors buy shares in rising stocks and sell shares in those that are falling. This momentum builds on itself and continues to drive rising share prices higher. Also known as relative strength investing, this strategy follows market trends to select stocks rather than other traditional valuation metrics.\nInvestors try to identify trends early to increase the amount of time they can profit from the run-up and decrease the time it takes to sell stocks on the decline. This strategy can be rather volatile, as it amounts to timing the market. Tools such as stop-loss, which is an order to sell a stock when it drops to a certain price, can help offset some of the risks.\nInnovation and Future Growth Potential\n- New products or technologies attract investor interest\n- Forward-looking growth statements signal opportunity\nInsider Activity and Institutional Investments\nWhen company insiders, such as senior management like the CEO and CFO, pick up company shares with their own money, it\u2019s known as insider buying. Many investors consider this a bullish sign, as these corporate insiders should have the best understanding of anyone as to the company\u2019s prospects.\nInstitutional activity in a stock can also affect its share price. Not only do institutions traffic in larger share counts, which could potentially drive prices, but they also have to report their investment in regular reports. Some investors try to mimic institutional share activity, so this can drive further price movements.\nStock Buybacks and Dividends\nTwo ways that companies can boost their share prices are through stock buybacks and dividends. In a stock buyback, a company will use some of its earnings to buy its own stock. Then, it will retire those shares, removing them from the available supply. With a reduced supply, share prices\u2013 and earnings per share \u2014 go up.\nStock dividends, in which cash is paid out to investors every quarter, attract long-term investors. This not only boosts demand for shares, but it also puts the stock in the hands of \u201cstrong holders,\u201d meaning they are less likely to sell in the short term. This can reduce the selling pressure on a stock, contributing to its upward climb.\nExternal Events and Global Factors\nSometimes, valuation, technical analysis and other factors don\u2019t matter as much as global events.\nHard Times\nIn times of great fear or panic, such as after 9/11 or when COVID-19 became a global pandemic, markets tend to sell off, regardless of valuation or earnings. Everything from the outbreak of a war to severe weather events to regulatory changes that make it hard for a company to do business can drive a stock price down.\nOptimistic Times\nSimilarly, in times of great optimism, stocks tend to trade up, even when considered overvalued by traditional standards. These events are termed exogenous events because they occur outside of the market or individual stocks themselves.\nIt\u2019s Only Temporary\nWhat\u2019s worth noting, however, is that oftentimes these outside factors are only temporary. This can create a buying opportunity in shares of companies that have traded down in price without any long-term fundamental changes.\nFinal Take\nOne of the reasons why a stock can be volatile is that it has so many factors affecting it at one time. From corporate earnings to insider transactions to macroeconomic, geopolitical and other factors, stock prices can get pushed and pulled in several directions at once.\nHowever, there can be an opportunity in this volatility. If a company\u2019s share price sells off due to factors that don\u2019t directly affect its operation, such as a passing round of fear in the overall market, it could prove to be a long-term buying opportunity.\nThe bottom line when it comes to investing is that although certain factors can help predict stock movements, the best approach is to have a diversified portfolio. Rather than putting all your eggs in one basket, owning several different stocks and investing in a variety of asset classes can help smooth out the ups and downs of your portfolio.\nFAQs on What Makes a Stock Go Up\nHere are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about stock prices and fluctuations.- What causes a stock to go up the most?\n- If more investors would rather buy a stock than sell it, its price will move up. It's a bit of a pithy statement, but the old Wall Street axiom that \"more buyers than sellers\" moves a stock the quickest, is true. Whether it's due to a strong upsurge in earnings, a new CEO, an analyst upgrade or even internet rumors, many factors ultimately affect a stock's price.\n- Do earnings reports always impact prices?\n- Earnings reports don't always impact stock prices, but earnings surprises typically do. If a company is expected to report earnings of $5 per share gain in a given quarter, but ends up with a $2 per share loss, investors will generally flee the stock.\n- How do external events influence stock growth?\n- All types of external factors can influence a stock's price. However, it's important to distinguish if these factors are only transitory or if they will have a long-term effect on a company's growth. If a company's only manufacturing plant gets wiped out in a hurricane, for example, this is a major challenge that could take a long time to resolve. If a company escapes unscathed and its share price drops just because investors are jittery about the storm, though, it may very well bounce back rapidly.\n- What role do institutional investors play in price increases?\n- As the market is a supply and demand mechanism, when there are a lot of shares being purchased at the same time, it can create stock price increases. As institutional investors, such as mutual funds, hedge funds and private foundations, tend to trade in much larger amounts than the average investor, they can move markets. However, knowing this could adversely affect their own purchases, most large institutions perform block trades or otherwise acquire shares in a way that won't cause too much market disruption.\nDaria Uhlig contributed to the reporting for this article.\nOur in-house research team and on-site financial experts work together to create content that\u2019s accurate, impartial, and up to date.

      "text": "Welcome back to meme retail share time, as department store retailer Kohl\u2019s meme stock became the latest unlikely name to unexpectedly and suddenly surge Tuesday.\nAt its height, the retailer\u2019s stock more than doubled from Monday\u2019s close of $10.42 per share, only to see a lot of those gains wiped out as markets opened, with trading in the stock temporarily suspended at one point Tuesday morning.\nBut at the shakeout, shares still closed about 37% higher on the day, on trading volumes of over 184 million shares, almost 17 times more than the average over the past 30 days.\nThat meant that the heavily shorted stock, which went public in 1992, recorded its largest-ever daily percentage increase, overtaking the 36% seen on January 24 2022 ,and has also run upward over two-thirds so far in July, which puts it on track to break the record for monthly gains of 51.2% it saw in November 2020.\nSo why has Kohl\u2019s become the latest meme stock and why has retail been at the heart of many such runs?\nFirstly, it could be a product of the fact that the stock market has pushed into record territory and bargains have become much harder to find, prompting investors once again to turn to some of Wall Street's beleaguered legacy companies in the hope of a quick win.\nAnd in such febrile conditions, and devoid of corporate announcements to boost its share value, Kohl\u2019s has got all the hallmarks of a meme stock. The retailer operates as a so-called legacy department store that has around 1,100 stores nationally, making it familiar to retail stock investors.\nIt also means Koh\u2019s is sitting on a lot of expensive real estate, with high costs, in a market that has become ever more competitive and has seen many of its peers go to the wall.\nKohl\u2019s Meme Stock Shorted\nShort interest as a percentage of Kohl\u2019s public float of shares sits at around 49.3%, compared with the 21.4% at another of this week\u2019s meme stock companies, Opendoor, against its public float.\nOver recent years Kohl\u2019s has also been the subject of takeover offers, activist campaigns and bankruptcy watchlists as it wrestles with the modern-day retail landscape \u2013 all encouraging a sense of volatility.\nAll that makes it\u2019s a poster boy as a potential meme stock, which typically start as the target of short sellers, or investors betting against the stock. If other investors start buying the shares and boost the price, that can often prompt the people betting against the stock to buy more shares in an effort to cushion their own losses.\nThis can lead to \u2018hockey-stick\u2019 increases in a company\u2019s shares even as it loses money, with retail investors in pursuit of a quick killing pile into the stock to try and ride the wave, suhc as Bed Bath & Beyond in 2023.\nAnd this time round its Kohl\u2019s stock that has been the subject of debate on forums such as Wall Street Bets on Reddit, which became notorious and the subject of a movie after the famous GameStop short squeeze in 2021.\nKohl\u2019 Meme Stock Vs Performance\nBeyond its share price, Kohl\u2019s business has been struggling for a number of years. Its sales are falling, it faces rising competition, and it is currently led by an interim CEO after its former CEO Ashley Buchanan was ousted over a conflict-of-interest scandal.\nFor the quarter ended 3 May, Kohl\u2019s reported net sales down 4.1% and comparable sales off 3.9% under the leadership of Michael Bender who has taken over as Kohl\u2019s Interim Chief Executive Office.\nLooking ahead, for the full year Kohl\u2019s forecast net sales down 5-7% and comparable sales off 4-6%. Hardly the stuff of retail surges.\nAs markets prepare to open, Kohl\u2019s meme stock status can expect to be back in the eye of the storm once again."

      "text": "For retail investors, the summer of 2025 is quickly turning into the latest meme stock moment.\nStocks like Opendoor (OPEN), Kohl's (KSS), and Krispy Kreme (DNUT) have replaced yesterday's meme darlings like GameStop (GME), AMC (AMC), and now-shuttered Bed, Bath & Beyond as the latest market curiosities, treating investors to wild price swings with little fundamental backing to explain the moves.\nOpendoor stock is up more than 300% over the past month and saw a 140% increase in retail trading over the two weeks preceding Friday compared to the previous month, according to trading data platform VandaTrack. Even with a roughly 21% decline since the opening bell on Monday, the stock is up more than 50% over the last five days.\nOn Wednesday, Krispy Kreme and GoPro (GPRO) rose by more than 90% and 70% in premarket trading, respectively \u2014 the latest entrants in 2025's meme stock redux. Both swung to losses before the bell on Thursday, after coming off intraday highs to close with less-spectacular gains.\nWhat's driving the renewed interest in highly speculative bets on names long ago written off by Wall Street? According to Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick, the market environment is simply right for risk.\n\"I think more and more investors are feeling somewhat invulnerable right now,\" Sosnick told Yahoo Finance. \"Everything they\u2019ve been trying has been working for them. If the basic stuff\u2019s working, why not try a bit more speculative stuff?\"\nAfter a historic drop in stocks following President Trump's early April \"Liberation Day\" tariff surprise, the stock market has spent the past few months roaring back as worst-case scenarios for trade and the global economy appear less likely.\nNow, the S&P 500 is routinely hitting record highs, including on Wednesday.\nFor investors who had the stomach to hold in early April, or even buy into the dip, those bets have largely worked out spectacularly well. And the winners haven't only been confined to the meme darlings mentioned above.\nThe risk-on environment has been buoyed by steady belief in the AI trade by investors. Nvidia (NVDA) has seen its stock price increase by more than 90% since its April nadir, while shares in Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) have grown by more than 40% since their respective April lows.\nCrypto enthusiasm, which has also gotten a boost from the White House, along with a refreshed IPO market, has seen stocks like Coinbase (COIN), Circle Internet Group (CRCL), and CoreWeave (CRWV) \u2014 which recently announced a $9 billion acquisition of Core Scientific (CORZ) \u2014 shoot upward by more than 60%, 550%, and 200% since the start of the year, respectively. Robinhood Markets (HOOD), the retail investor-focused trading platform, is up more than 170% on the year.\nEven SPACs are seeing a resurgence from their 2021 highs, with more than 70 blank-check IPOs and more than $12 billion in issuance recorded since the start of the year, according to data from SPAC-focused hedge fund RLH Capital.\nData from Stocktwits shows some 68% of the options market is now in calls, or options for the right to buy a certain security at a certain price \u2014 the highest concentration since 2021's meme stock craze. The firm's data also shows more than 25% of all trading volume this year has been in stocks under the $5 share price line. Low per-share stocks were also a staple of 2021's meme stock rally.\nThe origins of the 'meme stock' meme\nIn January 2021, deep in the throes of the pandemic, speculative stock betting by retail traders reached a fever pitch. An explosive rally in shares of GameStop eventually canonized what investors now know as a \"meme stock.\"\nSpurred by discussion on the subreddit wallstreetbets and the bull case made by one individual investor \u2014 Keith Gill, known to redditors as \"Roaring Kitty\" \u2014 GameStop shares swelled by as much as 1,600% in January 2021 before crashing in early February.\nThe rally in GameStop was so strong that it led Gabe Plotkin, founder of the hedge fund Melvin Capital Management, to shutter his fund after the firm's short bets on GameStop went upside down in a \"short squeeze\" as the stock rallied.\nFour years later, the names are different and the gains may be more modest, but the shape of the rally is similar.\nWallstreetbets has been inundated over the past few weeks with posts about a growing basket of names that have been ID'd for potentially massive gains, including Opendoor, Kohl's, GoPro, Krispy Kreme, and BitMine Immersion Technologies (BMNR).\nAnd taking a version of the role vacated by Roaring Kitty is hedge fund manager Eric Jackson.\nJackson, who rose to prominence for being an early spotter of Carvana's (CVNA) turnaround, publicly laid out a bull case for Opendoor earlier this month with a price target of $82 for a stock currently trading below $3.\n'It could all end tomorrow'\nAnd much like 2021, small-cap names grabbing headlines now tend to have a relatively high percentage of their shares on the market sold short.\nFor Opendoor and Krispy Kreme, the percentage of outstanding shares being sold short is sitting at around 21% and 28%, respectively. Meanwhile, Kohl's boasts a whopping 49% short float, which means that just under half of its outstanding eligible shares are being borrowed to bet the company's share price will drop.\nSome strategists have even suggested this \"short squeeze\" theme is playing a significant role in the broader market's rebound from those April lows.\nA notable difference from 2021, however, is that the half-life of trades on new-age meme stock names like Opendoor seems to be shorter than the timelines that ended up sustaining a long retail bull run on GameStop in 2021, Interactive Brokers' Sosnick told Yahoo Finance.\n\"It could all end tomorrow, it could all end in months \u2026 Kohl's is not going to suddenly become a great company tomorrow,\" Sosnick said. \"If enough people get on one side of an option trade, it can become self-fulfilling, at least in the short term.\"\nThis market environment also isn't without risk \u2014 and harm \u2014 to individual investors who are often swept up in these trades.\nA study released in June from the CFP Board of Standards found that 57% of Americans have made a poor financial decision based on information they saw online, while 18% have lost more than $1,000 based on online information.\n\"This kind of retail behavior often marks short-term tops,\" Stocktwits editor in chief Tom Bruni told Yahoo Finance. \"When the buzz dies down in these highfliers, we usually see broader market consolidation or a pullback.\"\nJake Conley is a breaking news reporter covering US equities for Yahoo Finance.

  "argos_summary": "Meme stocks are experiencing a resurgence in 2025, with companies like Opendoor, Kohl's, and Krispy Kreme seeing significant price increases driven by online hype rather than strong fundamentals. The phenomenon is fueled by AI-driven sentiment analysis and high short-interest levels, which can lead to rapid price surges as short sellers are forced to cover their positions. However, this speculative trading carries risks, as many investors may lose money when the excitement fades and prices drop.",
