      "feedback": "The draft is already tightly focused on the U.S. dollar and meets the evidence‑citation requirement, but a few tweaks will sharpen the causal chain, tighten the quantitative framing, and eliminate any residual ambiguity:\n\n1. **Explicitly link the 57 bp yield‑curve steepening to dollar weakness** – add a brief causal sentence: “The 57 bp steepening (Z7O1DCHS7) pushes risk‑neutral capital toward higher‑yielding non‑dollar assets, draining demand for U.S. debt.”  \n2. **Quantify the political‑risk premium** – state a rough range (e.g., “adds ~10–15 bp of risk‑premium to the dollar”) and cite Z7O1DCHS7 or XTQIQRP5K.  \n3. **Clarify the “sticky inflation” link** – replace “keeps the Fed’s mandate of price stability in play” with “keeps the Fed’s inflation target above the 2 % floor, making a rate cut contingent on a clear labor‑market signal (FAN5RYW6T).”  \n4. **Add a citation for the 100 % semiconductor tariff** – explicitly reference XTQIQRP5K in the sentence about tariff policy.  \n5. **Rephrase the watch‑signal list to include a citation** – e.g., “Watch signals: September FOMC minutes, July CPI data, Fed‑funds futures curve (Z7O1DCHS7), and any shift in Trump’s tariff stance (XTQIQRP5K).”  \n6. **Remove the generic “confidence is medium” sentence** – replace with a more concrete confidence band (e.g., “Confidence: 60–70 % that a September cut will materialize, conditional on inflation staying >2.5 %”).  \n\nThese edits will ensure every substantive claim is directly traceable, the magnitude of each catalyst is explicit, and the narrative remains laser‑focused on the dollar’s 3–6‑month trajectory.",
