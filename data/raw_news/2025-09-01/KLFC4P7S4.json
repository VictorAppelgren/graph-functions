  "title": "Every fusion startup that has raised over $100M",
  "description": "Fusion startups have raised $7.1 billion to date, with the majority of it going to a handful of companies.",
  "content": "Over the last several years, fusion power has gone from the butt of jokes \u2014 always a decade away! \u2014 to an increasingly tangible and tantalizing technology that has drawn investors off the sidelines.\n\nThe technology may be challenging to master and expensive to build today, but fusion promises to harness the nuclear reaction that powers the sun to generate nearly limitless energy here on Earth. If startups are able to complete commercially viable fusion power plants, then they have the potential to upend trillion-dollar markets.\n\nThe bullish wave buoying the fusion industry has been driven by three advances: more powerful computer chips, more sophisticated AI, and powerful high-temperature superconducting magnets. Together, they have helped deliver more sophisticated reactor designs, better simulations, and more complex control schemes.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt that, at the end of 2022, a U.S. Department of Energy lab announced that it had produced a controlled fusion reaction that produced more power than the lasers had imparted to the fuel pellet. The experiment had crossed what\u2019s known as scientific breakeven, and while it\u2019s still a long ways from commercial breakeven, where the reaction produces more than the entire facility consumes, it was a long-awaited step that proved the underlying science was sound.\n\nFounders have built on that momentum in recent years, pushing the private fusion industry forward at a rapid pace.\n\nCommonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) has raised about a third of all private capital invested in fusion companies to date. Its latest round, which closed in August, added $863 million to its coffers, bringing its total raised near $3 billion.\n\nCFS\u2019s Series B2 came four years after its $1.8 billion Series B, which helped catapult the company into the pole position. Since then, the startup has been hard at work in Massachusetts building Sparc, its first-of-a-kind power plant intended to produce power at what it calls \u201ccommercially relevant\u201d levels.\n\nSparc\u2019s reactor is a tokamak design, which resembles a doughnut. The D-shaped cross section is wound with high-temperature superconducting tape, which, when energized, generates a powerful magnetic field that will contain and compress the superheated plasma. Heat generated from the reaction is converted to steam to power a turbine. CFS designed its magnets in collaboration with MIT, where co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard worked as a researcher on fusion reactor designs and high-temperature superconductors.\n\nThe Massachusetts-based CFS expects to have Sparc operational in late 2026 or early 2027. Later this decade, the company says it will begin construction on Arc, its commercial power plant that will produce 400 megawatts of electricity. The facility will be built near Richmond, Virginia, and Google has agreed to buy half its output.\n\nCFS is backed by a long list of investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, The Engine, Bill Gates, and others.\n\nFounded in 1998, TAE Technologies (formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy) was spun out of the University of California, Irvine by Norman Rostoker. It uses a field-reversed configuration, but with a twist: after the two plasma shots collide in the middle of the reactor, the company bombards the plasma with particle beams to keep it spinning in a cigar shape. That improves the stability of the plasma, allowing more time for fusion to occur and for more heat to be extracted to spin a turbine.\n\nThe company raised $150 million in June from existing investors, including Google, Chevron, and New Enterprise. TAE has raised $1.79 billion in total, according to PitchBook.\n\nOf all fusion startups, Helion has the most aggressive timeline. The company plans to produce electricity from its reactor in 2028. Its first customer? Microsoft.\n\nHelion, based in Everett, Washington, uses a type of reactor called a field-reversed configuration, where magnets surround a reaction chamber that looks like an hourglass with a bulge at the point where the two sides come together. At each end of the hourglass, they spin the plasma into doughnut shapes that are shot toward each other at more than 1 million mph. When they collide in the middle, additional magnets help induce fusion. When fusion occurs, it boosts the plasma\u2019s own magnetic field, which induces an electrical current inside the reactor\u2019s magnetic coils. That electricity is then harvested directly from the machine.\n\nThe company raised $425 million in January 2025, around the same time that it turned on Polaris, a prototype reactor. Helion has raised $1.03 billion, according to PitchBook. Investors include Sam Altman, Reid Hoffman, KKR, BlackRock, Peter Thiel\u2019s Mithril Capital Management, and Capricorn Investment Group.\n\nPacific Fusion burst out of the gate with a $900 million Series A, a whopping sum even among well-funded fusion startups. The company will use inertial confinement to achieve fusion, but instead of lasers compressing the fuel, it will use coordinated electromagnetic pulses. The trick is in the timing: All 156 impedance-matched Marx generators need to produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds, and those pulses need to simultaneously converge on the target.\n\nThe company is led by CEO Eric Lander, the scientist who led the Human Genome Project, and president Will Regan. Pacific Fusion\u2019s funding might be massive, but the startup hasn\u2019t gotten it all at once. Rather, its investors will pay out in tranches when the company achieves specified milestones, an approach that\u2019s common in biotech.\n\nShine Technologies is taking a cautious \u2014 and possibly pragmatic \u2014 approach to generating fusion power. Selling electrons from a fusion power plant is years off, so instead, it\u2019s starting by selling neutron testing and medical isotopes. More recently, it has been developing a way to recycle radioactive waste. Shine hasn\u2019t picked an approach for a future fusion reactor, instead saying that it\u2019s developing necessary skills for when that time comes.\n\nThe company has raised a total of $778 million, according to PitchBook. Investors include Energy Ventures Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, Nucleation Capital, and the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation.\n\nNow its third decade, General Fusion has raised $462.53 million, according to PitchBook. The Richmond, British Columbia-based company was founded in 2002 by physicist Michel Laberge, who wanted to prove a different approach to fusion known as magnetized target fusion (MTF). Investors include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, BDC Capital, and Chrysalix Venture Capital.\n\nIn General Fusion\u2019s reactor, a liquid metal wall surrounds a chamber in which plasma is injected. Pistons surrounding the wall push it inward, compressing the plasma inside and sparking a fusion reaction. The resulting neutrons heat the liquid metal, which can be circulated through a heat exchanger to generate steam to spin a turbine.\n\nGeneral Fusion hit a rough patch in spring 2025. The company ran short of cash as it was building LM26, its latest device that it hoped would hit breakeven in 2026. Just days after hitting a key milestone, it laid off 25% of its staff. CEO Greg Twinney penned an open letter pleading for funding from investors.\n\nIn August, they delivered somewhat, injecting $22 million in an pay-to-play round that one investor called \u201cthe least amount of capital possible\u201d to keep the General Fusion afloat.\n\nTokamak Energy takes the usual tokamak design \u2014 the doughnut shape \u2014 and squeezes it, reducing its aspect ratio to the point where the outer bounds start resembling a sphere. Like many other tokamak-based startups, the company uses high-temperature superconducting magnets (of the rare earth barium copper oxide, or REBCO, variety). Since its design is more compact than a traditional tokamak, it requires less in the way of magnets, which should reduce costs.\n\nThe Oxfordshire, U.K.-based startup\u2019s ST40 prototype, which looks like a large, steampunk Faberg\u00e9 egg, generated an ultra-hot, 100 million degree C plasma in 2022. Its next generation, Demo 4, is currently under construction and is intended to test the company\u2019s magnets in \u201cfusion power plant-relevant scenarios.\u201d Tokamak Energy raised $125 million in November 2024 to continue its reactor design efforts and expand its magnet business.\n\nIn total, the company has raised $336 million from investors including Future Planet Capital, In-Q-Tel, Midven, and Capri-Sun founder Hans-Peter Wild, according to PitchBook.\n\nZap Energy isn\u2019t using high-temperature superconducting magnets or super-powerful lasers to keep its plasma confined. Rather, it zaps the plasma (get it?) with an electric current, which then generates its own magnetic field. The magnetic field compresses the plasma about 1 millimeter, at which point ignition occurs. The neutrons released by the fusion reaction bombard a liquid metal blanket that surrounds the reactor, heating it up. The liquid metal is then cycled through a heat exchanger, where it produces steam to drive a turbine.\n\nLike Helion, Zap Energy is based in Everett, Washington, and the company has raised $327 million, according to PitchBook. Backers include Bill Gates\u2019 Breakthrough Energy Ventures, DCVC, Lowercarbon, Energy Impact Partners, Chevron Technology Ventures, and Bill Gates as an angel.\n\nMost investors have favored large startups that are pursuing tokamak designs or some flavor of inertial confinement. But stellarators have shown great promise in scientific experiments, including the Wendelstein 7-X reactor in Germany.\n\nProxima Fusion is bucking the trend, though, having attracted a \u20ac130 million Series A that brings its total raised to more than \u20ac185 million. Investors include Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures.\n\nStellarators are similar to tokamaks in that they confine plasma in a ring-like shape using powerful magnets. But they do it with a twist \u2014 literally. Rather than force plasma into a human-designed ring, stellarators twist and bulge to accommodate the plasma\u2019s quirks. The result should be a plasma that remains stable for longer, increasing the chances of fusion reactions.\n\nMarvel Fusion follows the inertial confinement approach, the same basic technique that the National Ignition Facility used to prove that controlled nuclear fusion reactions could produce more power than was needed to kick them off. Marvel fires powerful lasers at a target embedded with silicon nanostructures that cascade under the bombardment, compressing the fuel to the point of ignition. Because the target is made using silicon, it should be relatively simple to manufacture, leaning on the semiconductor manufacturing industry\u2019s decades of experience.\n\nThe inertial confinement fusion startup is building a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, which it expects to have operational by 2027. Munich-based Marvel has raised a total of $161 million from investors including b2venture, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, HV Capital, and Taavet Hinrikus and Albert Wenger as angels.\n\nFirst Light dropped its pursuit of fusion power in March 2025, pivoting instead to become a technology supplier to fusion startups and other companies. The startup had previously followed an approach known as inertial confinement, in which fusion fuel pellets are compressed until they ignite.\n\nFirst Light, which is based in Oxfordshire, U.K., has raised $140 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Invesco, IP Group, and Tencent.\n\nThough nothing about fusion can be described as simple, Xcimer takes a relatively straightforward approach: follow the basic science that\u2019s behind the National Ignition Facility\u2019s breakthrough net-positive experiment, and redesign the technology that underpins it from the ground up. The Colorado-based startup is aiming for a 10-megajoule laser system, five times more powerful than NIF\u2019s setup that made history. Molten salt walls surround the reaction chamber, absorbing heat and protecting the first solid wall from damage.\n\nFounded in January 2022, Xcimer has already raised $109 million, according to PitchBook, from investors including Hedosophia, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, and Lowercarbon Capital.\n\nThis story was originally published in September 2024 and will be continually updated.",

      "text": "Rare-earth barium copper oxide\nRare-earth barium copper oxide (ReBCO[1]) is a family of chemical compounds known for exhibiting high-temperature superconductivity (HTS).[2] ReBCO superconductors have the potential to sustain stronger magnetic fields than other superconductor materials. Due to their high critical temperature and critical magnetic field, this class of materials are proposed for use in technical applications where conventional low-temperature superconductors do not suffice. This includes magnetic confinement fusion reactors such as the ARC reactor, allowing a more compact and potentially more economical construction,[3] and superconducting magnets to use in future particle accelerators to come after the Large Hadron Collider, which utilizes low-temperature superconductors.[4][5]\nMaterials\n[edit]Any rare-earth element can be used in a ReBCO; popular choices include yttrium (YBCO), lanthanum (LBCO), samarium (Sm123),[6] neodymium (Nd123 and Nd422),[7] gadolinium (Gd123) and europium (Eu123),[8] where the numbers among parenthesis indicate the molar ratio among rare-earth, barium and copper.\nYBCO\n[edit]The most famous ReBCO is yttrium barium copper oxide, YBa2Cu3O7\u2212x (or Y123), the first superconductor found with a critical temperature above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen.[10] Its molar ratio is 1 to 2 to 3 for yttrium, barium, and copper and it has a unit cell consisting of subunits, which is the typical structure of perovskites. In particular, the subunits are three, overlapping and containing an yttrium atom at the center of the middle one and a barium atom at the center of the others. Therefore, yttrium and barium are stacked according to the sequence [Ba-Y-Ba], along an axis conventionally denoted by c, (the vertical direction in the figure at the top right).\nThe resulting cell has an orthorhombic structure, unlike other superconducting cuprates that generally have a tetragonal structure. All the corner sites of the unit cell are occupied by copper, which has two different coordinates, Cu(1) and Cu(2), with respect to oxygen. It offers four possible crystallographic sites for oxygen: O(1), O(2), O(3), and O(4).[11]\nHistory\n[edit]Because these kind of materials are brittle it was difficult to create wires from them. After 2010, industrial manufacturers started to produce tapes,[12] with different layers encapsulating the ReBCO material,[13] opening the way to commercial uses.\nIn September 2021 Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) created a test magnet with ReBCO tape that handled a current of 40,000 amperes, with a magnetic field of 20 tesla at 20 K.[14][15] One important innovation was to avoid insulating the tape, saving space and lowering required voltages. Another was the size of the magnet: 10 tons, far larger than any prior experiment. The magnet assembly consisted of 16 plates, called pancakes, each hosting a spiral winding of tape on one side and cooling channels on the other.[16]\nIn 2023, the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory generated 32 tesla with a ReBCO superconducting magnet.[17][18] A 40T superconducting magnet is under construction.\nIn June 2024, the first plasma was achieved in the HH70 tokamak, developed by the China-based fusion energy company Energy Singularity. Using ReBCO as material for the superconductors enabled the company to reduce the size of the HH70 tokamak to two percent of conventional tokamaks.[19]\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ Jha, Alok K.; Matsumoto, Kaname (2019). \"Superconductive REBCO Thin Films and Their Nanocomposites: The Role of Rare-Earth Oxides in Promoting Sustainable Energy\".

Meanwhile, Google is sending CFS a check as part of a new, unannounced funding round.\nThe new round will be \u201ccomparable\u201d to the previous one, CFS co-founder and CEO Bob Mumgaard said. CFS\u2019s most recent funding round, a Series B that Google participated in and that brought in $1.8 billion, closed in 2021. The company has raised the most of any fusion startup.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very strong demand signal,\u201d said Mumgaard. \u201cThis investment allows us to do some of the R&D that will enable us to go into Arc faster.\u201d\nCFS is building a demonstration reactor, known as Sparc, just outside of Boston. That facility will be completed in 2026, according to Mumgaard. Arc, the company\u2019s commercial power plant, will be built near Richmond, Virginia.\nThe new deal marks only the second time a major company has agreed to buy power from a fusion startup. The first was signed in 2023 when Microsoft agreed to buy the output of Helion\u2019s first commercial power plant, which is scheduled to come online in 2028.\nLike other hyperscalers, Google has been scouring the globe for new sources of electricity.

In the short term, the company has prioritized solar, wind, and batteries. A bit further out, it\u2019s betting on geothermal and small modular nuclear reactors, as evidenced by its investments in geothermal startup Fervo Energy and nuclear startup Kairos Power.\nFusion energy is a bit further out, and that \u201cwould certainly put this [CFS investment] in the long-term category,\u201d he said.\nGoogle bought 8 gigawatts of renewable power in 2024, twice what it purchased in 2023. And while solar, wind, and batteries have been the main additions to Google\u2019s portfolio in recent years, Terrell told TechCrunch that the company will need other power sources to allow its data centers to operate 24/7.\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a path with wind and solar and storage in regions where the resource is very strong,\u201d he said, citing places like the Midwest, which has consistent winds, and the Southwest, which has mostly cloud-free skies. But other places, like the Southeastern U.S. and many countries in the Asia-Pacific region, might be too cloudy or their power grids too fragmented to make traditional renewables work.\nTo compensate for those shortfalls, one approach is to overbuild wind and solar, but that can get expensive quickly.\nTechnologies like fusion \u201cactually bring the cost down of achieving high penetrations of carbon-free energy,\u201d Terrell said. \u201cIf you have these clean, firm technologies \u2014 even if they\u2019re more expensive on a per megawatt-hour basis \u2014 if you\u2019re sort of folding those into the portfolio, it actually brings your overall portfolio costs down.\u201d\nMumgaard is confident that CFS can deliver power to Google in less than a decade, and when that happens, he thinks that demand for fusion will skyrocket.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t depend on geography or weather, doesn\u2019t depend on access to special materials. It\u2019s something that you could run 24/7,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expect that fusion can have a really big payoff because once it\u2019s shown that you can do this and you have a first power plant up and running, you could scale it.

      "text": "Few fusion startups have been as closely watched as Helion. The 12-year-old company is backed by Sam Altman, rumored to be in talks with OpenAI, and has a deal to supply Microsoft with electricity by 2028 \u2014 years earlier than its competitors.\nThe company\u2019s unorthodox approach to fusion power and relative secrecy has earned it plenty of fans \u2014 and critics. But don\u2019t count its investors among the naysayers.\nHelion announced Tuesday a $425 million Series F raise that pushed its valuation $5.245 billion. The startup also flipped the switch last month on its latest prototype, Polaris, which it anticipates will be the first fusion reactor to generate electricity.\nPolaris, Helion\u2019s seventh prototype, sits inside a 27,000-square-foot building in Everett, Washington. It took more than three years to build, which is quick by fusion industry standards. But to hit its ambitious 2028 deadline for Microsoft, the startup will have to move even faster on its commercial-scale power plant.\nThe difficulties Helion faces are in many ways similar to those in other leading-edge industries.\n\u201cIn AI, what\u2019s the big challenge? Getting the chips. In fusion, what\u2019s the big challenge? Getting the chips,\u201d CEO David Kirtley told TechCrunch in a recent interview. \u201cPolaris is 50,000 of these large-scale, pulse-power semiconductors, and getting those set the timeline.\u201d\nThe solutions it\u2019s seeking are similar, too. The new investment will go toward bringing a significant amount of specialized manufacturing in-house. For example, the company had to order a type of short-term energy storage device known as capacitors three years in advance.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\n\u201cOur goal is to go from waiting three years for a supplier to give us capacitors to us making our own capacitors but faster, so now we can make them in a year or less,\u201d he said.\nDespite having to build a supply chain from scratch, Kirtley remains optimistic that Helion can still deliver electrons to Microsoft in just a few years.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on siting for the Microsoft facility for a few years already,\u201d Kirtley said. He declined to name a location, but said the company has been working on permitting and grid interconnection, a process that can take years.\nPart of Helion\u2019s appeal \u2014 and part of the risk, critics would argue \u2014 is that its approach to fusion power differs from virtually every other startup in the sector.\nGenerally speaking, there are two main approaches: Magnetic confinement uses powerful magnets to squeeze plasma to get it hot and dense enough to spark fusion reactions, which are meant to burn continuously to generate steam to drive a turbine. Inertial confinement fires powerful lasers at fuel pellets, compressing them to the point where the fuel atoms fuse. To generate enough heat to feed a steam turbine, a reactor has to fire several times per second.\nHelion is building something completely different, known as a field-reversed configuration reactor. The device looks like an hourglass with a bulge in the middle, and it\u2019s ringed with powerful magnets, which guide and compress the plasma throughout the course of each reaction, which Helion calls a \u201cpulse.\u201d\nAt the beginning of a pulse, Helion injects a mix of deuterium and helium-3 into each end and heats it until it forms a plasma. Magnets then shape each plasma into a doughnut and propel them toward each other at more than 1 million miles per hour.\nWhen the plasmas reach the fusion chamber \u2014 the bulge in the middle of the hourglass \u2014 they collide and are squeezed further by another set of magnets. This heats the plasma to more than 100 million degrees C, leading to a cascade of atoms fusing. Altogether, it\u2019s similar to how a spark plug ignites fuel inside an internal combustion engine.\nThe energy added by the fusion reactions generates a surge in magnetic force, which pushes back on the reactor\u2019s magnets. This extra magnetic force is then converted directly into electricity. If everything works as intended, Helion\u2019s reactor will generate more electricity from that magnetic burst than it needed to power the magnets in the first place. And because the system harvests electricity from magnets instead of generating steam to spin a turbine, it should be more efficient, lowering the bar to break even.\nThe current design for a commercial-scale Helion reactor will pulse a few times per second, Kirtley said. A single reactor will generate 50 megawatts of electricity, and a power plant could contain multiple reactors.\nIn the lab, the company has small systems that can fire more than 100 times per second, so it\u2019s possible that future Helion reactors will be able to fire 60 pulses per second, the same frequency as electricity on the grid. \u201cBut there\u2019s some big engineering challenges to get to those high repetition rates at the kind of big pulse powers where we talk about millions of amps flowing around,\u201d Kirtley said.\nHelion raised the new funding to speed work on the power plant, including expanding in-house machining capabilities and capacitor manufacturing. \u201cOne of the things that drove the Polaris timeline was actually making all the magnetic coils. And so I want to be able to make all of those in-house,\u201d he said.\nThe new round is smaller than the startup\u2019s previous fundraise of $500 million. New investors in the round include Lightspeed Venture Partners, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, and a major university endowment. Existing investors Sam Altman, Capricorn Investment Group, Mithril Capital, Dustin Moskovitz, and Nucor also participated."

That confidence is echoed by many in the field after the National Ignition Facility demonstrated two years ago that controlled fusion reactions could generate more power than they take to ignite.\nCommonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) has raised more money than its competitors, and it\u2019s widely considered to have the best chance at bringing commercial fusion power to fruition in the next decade.\nThe commercial power plant, known as Arc, is expected to generate 400 megawatts of electricity. While many new power plants are being designed to feed directly into hyperscale data centers \u2014 often a quicker path to market \u2014 CFS is working with the utility Dominion Energy to connect Arc to the grid.\n\u201cFor our first power plant, it was important for us to put power onto the grid,\u201d Kristen Cullen, CFS\u2019s vice president of global policy and public affairs, told TechCrunch.\nThe company settled on the Virginia site after considering many other possibilities. \u201cLots of sites would have worked for this,\u201d Cullen said. \u201cWe looked at sites at the global level, really focusing in on the U.S. following a unanimous decision by the [Nuclear Regulatory Commission] to regulate fusion in a way that we felt was appropriate for the industry.\u201d\nOnce the field had narrowed, Cullen said the team looked for sites with strong transportation networks to support the construction project. They also wanted to be near an existing power plant, both to facilitate the grid connection and to access a labor pool that\u2019s familiar with industry.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

It\u2019s the world\u2019s first fusion power plant,\u201d Cullen said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to want to take a lot of people here. We\u2019re going to want to take tours through. We\u2019re going to want to show different energy ministers and heads of state what fusion\u2019s all about.\u201d\nCFS is leasing the land for Arc from Dominion, though apart from that, no money is changing hands between the two partners. CFS anticipates that Dominion will be able to help the startup secure permits and hook the power plant up to the grid, and in exchange, the utility will be one of the first, if not the first, to gain experience working with a fusion power plant.\n\u201cThey\u2019re quite interested in dipping their toe in the water here and understanding what it means to bring fusion power to the grid,\u201d Rick Needham, CFS\u2019s chief commercial officer, told TechCrunch.\nCFS is pursuing a type of fusion known as \u201cmagnetic confinement,\u201d in which powerful magnets compress and confine superheated plasma. There are many shapes that plasma can take, but CFS is corralling it in what\u2019s known as a tokamak, a sort of doughnut shape that\u2019s one of the best studied approaches to magnetic confinement. Inside the tokamak, as the plasma gets squeezed, the supercharged particles are more likely to bump into one another with such force that atomic nuclei fuse, unleashing tremendous amounts of energy.\nThe wall of the tokamak will be made of a molten salt that will capture heat and transfer it to a steam turbine used to generate electricity. The molten salt blanket will also absorb harmful neutrons and use them to generate tritium, one of the two hydrogen isotopes the reactor will run on. The other, deuterium, can be harvested from seawater.\nArc won\u2019t be CFS\u2019s first facility. The company is currently building Sparc, a demonstration plant, in Devens, Massachusetts. It plans to start commissioning Sparc later in 2025 and, in 2026, achieving \u201cfirst plasma\u201d \u2014 an industry term for when a fusion reactor fires up for the first time.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll hit net energy gain soon thereafter,\u201d Needham said. If the company succeeds, it will mark the first time a tokamak has reached that milestone. To date, only the National Ignition Facility has been able to produce a net-positive, controlled nuclear fusion reaction.\nTo build Arc, the company will need to raise new funds. Raising a new equity round is a likely path, though Needham said that the company is also exploring \u201cother sources of capital,\u201d including debt and government grants. In June, CFS received $15 million from the Department of Energy through its Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program.\nWhile CFS has its eyes on Sparc and Arc today, Needham said the company is already beginning to think about what comes after those. \u201cBecause of all the work we\u2019ve done, we found a lot of great sites,\u201d Needham said. \u201cOur objective as a company is not to build a fusion power plant. It\u2019s to build thousands.\u201d"

Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) previously raised a $1.8 billion round in 2021.\nFusion power has long been promised as a nearly limitless energy source, though it wasn\u2019t until recently that investors considered it a bet worth placing. As advances in computing and AI have quickened the pace of research and development, the sector has become a hotbed of startup and investor activity.\nInside a fusion reaction, atoms are compressed and heated until they form a fourth state of matter known as plasma. When the plasma reaches the right temperature and pressure, those atoms begin to fuse, releasing tremendous amounts of energy in the process.\nCFS is currently building a prototype reactor called Sparc in a Boston suburb. The company expects to turn that device on later next year and achieve scientific breakeven in 2027, a milestone in which the fusion reaction produces more energy than was required to ignite it.\nThough Sparc isn\u2019t designed to sell power to the grid, it\u2019s still vital to CFS\u2019s success.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Tokamaks are well known among the research community.\n\u201cWe know that this kind of idea should work,\u201d Mordijck said. \u201cThe question is naturally, how will it perform?\u201d\nInvestors appear to like what they\u2019ve seen so far. The list of participants in the Series B2 round is lengthy. No single investor led the round, and a number of existing investors increased their stakes, said Ally Yost, CFS\u2019s senior vice president of corporate development.\nExisting investors that increased their stakes include Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Eni, Future Ventures, Gates Frontier, Google, Hostplus, Khosla Ventures, Lowercarbon Capital, Safar Partners, Eric Schmidt, Starlight Ventures, and Tiger Global.\nThe new investors include Brevan Howard, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Counterpoint Global, Stanley Druckenmiller, FFA Private Bank in Dubai, Galaxy Interactive, Gigascale Capital, HOF Capital, Neva SGR, Nvidia\u2019s NVentures, Planet First Partners, Woori Venture Partners US, and a consortium of 12 Japanese companies led by Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and Mitsubishi Corporation.\nSuch a broad base of investors may prove helpful as the company develops its supply chain and searches for partners to build its power plants and buy electricity from them. So far, the company has inked a deal with Google to buy 200 megawatts from Arc.\nAs the first of its kind, Arc is likely to cost more than subsequent power plants, Mordijck said.\nAnd while Sparc will help prove the science is sound, it will do more than that for CFS, Mumgaard told TechCrunch. \u201cThat\u2019s very important. But it\u2019s also to know the capabilities that you need to be able to deliver it. It\u2019s also to have the receipts, know what these things cost.\u201d\nThe new round will help CFS make progress on Sparc, but it will not be enough to build Arc, which will likely cost several billion dollars, Mumgaard said. At this point, the company doesn\u2019t know exactly what shape the funding for Arc will take.\n\u201cThe fact that it\u2019s a first of a kind technology is a wrinkle that then has a big impact on where the capital will come from,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not entirely sure, but we are pretty committed to doing this.

Now, it might actually be on the cusp of commercialization.\nNo, really.\nIf that refrain sounds all too familiar, it\u2019s because, well, something like that was written 10 years ago. Fusion research has been simmering for decades. But now, it\u2019s reaching a boiling point, and there\u2019s plenty of evidence to suggest that this time will be different.\nFor a field that has existed for more than 60 years, a lot has happened in fusion research in the last half-decade. Researchers have set new records for how long they can contain the superheated plasma that fusion requires. Magnets to contain those plasmas have grown stronger and more efficient. As a result, the power produced by each fusion experiment has ramped up steadily, creeping closer to the point where the reactors produce more power than they consume, known as the break-even point.\nIt\u2019s as though fusion research were a race, but the different groups competing weren\u2019t sure where they were on the course. Then, suddenly, they all spotted the finish line: reactors creating as much power as they gobble up.\nBuoyed by those results, investors are betting large amounts of money that fusion will soon banish the ghosts of its past: Fusion startups raised $2.7 billion in the last year alone, according to a TechCrunch analysis of PitchBook data.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nSuch a sudden burst of progress across a number of different approaches might seem implausible at first glance. At the very least, it cuts against the popular narrative of the lone genius making a key discovery that cracks the problem once and for all. But it suggests that fusion power\u2019s time has arrived.\n\u201cAre we at an inflection point in fusion?\u201d said Eric Toone, technical lead of the investment committee at Breakthrough Energy Ventures. \u201cWe absolutely believe so.\u201d\nBreakthrough is one of a handful of investors that have placed sizable bets on fusion power becoming a reality. Started by Bill Gates, Breakthrough joined a $1.8 billion Series B for Commonwealth Fusion Systems last year, its third investment in the startup. (Gates personally joined that round, too.) Chevron and Google in July led a $250 million Series G for TAE Technologies, which has been around since 1998. Helion Energy raised $500 million last year, led by Sam Altman. Zap Energy closed a $160 million round earlier this year.\nThat\u2019s a lot of money riding on a yet-unproven technology. Fusion power isn\u2019t preordained, of course \u2014 humanity isn\u2019t fated to control the power of the sun. But the recent momentum created by three technological advances suggests we\u2019re closer than ever. And that frenzy can be explained by a concept drawn from a very different field of study: evolutionary biology.\nThe quest for fusion power has been a slog, to put it mildly. The first theories concerning nuclear fusion were developed over 100 years ago, and serious applied research into fusion reactors started in the Soviet Union in the mid-1950s. Progress was slow, though, while fusion\u2019s cousin, fission, moved comparably quickly from lab curiosity to doomsday weapon to utility-grade source of electricity.\nResearch suggested some of fusion\u2019s hurdles could be overcome by making bigger tokamaks, the doughnut-shaped containers in which magnetic fields contain the superheated plasma. Larger tokamaks make it easier to obtain higher power outputs with weaker magnetic fields. That understanding helped kick off a trend of larger and more expensive experiments.\nThe Joint European Torus, which broke ground in 1982, was among the first large-scale fusion experiments, and the trend arguably peaked with the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, better known as ITER.\nITER is the offspring of efforts to achieve a detente in the Cold War in the 1980s; Reagan and Gorbachev settled on the idea as a way for the two superpowers to cooperate. Since then, ITER has expanded to include six countries and the EU, each contributing a piece to the project.\nITER\u2019s initial designs took over 15 years to nail down, and it was another four years before the member nations decided where to build it. The consortium broke ground in the south of France in 2007, and when I visited the site in 2019, the massive construction site was beginning to resemble the renderings of its plans.\nBut as I watched engineers wrap miles upon miles of niobium-based wire to create its massive magnets, and when I peered into the depths of the massive unfinished tokamak, it was clear that it had a long way to go. Today, ITER is still another decade or so from \u201cfirst plasma,\u201d an industry term for when a fusion reactor first starts up.\nPlenty of observers have gazed upon ITER and concluded that the project is a folly. It might hit its milestones, but at what cost and after how many years? It\u2019s already cost at least $22 billion and progress has stalled so many times that people questioned whether the zero-emission power source could make a dent in climate change before it was too late.\nBut fusion research wasn\u2019t waiting for ITER to fire up. Scientists have made steady progress in the 30 years since ITER was conceived, learning how to build the complex systems needed to bring 100-million-degree plasma to heel and gathering data on numerous different types of reactors.\nAnother approach to fusion has shown promise: Inertial confinement, which uses lasers to zap a tiny fuel pellet, has arguably come the closest to breakeven, but it, too, has a ways to go.\n\u201cFusion isn\u2019t hard. What\u2019s hard is energy-positive fusion,\u201d Breakthrough partner Phil Larochelle said.\nNew confidence\nEveryone in the fusion industry admits they\u2019re still at least several years away from hitting breakeven. But the pace of progress, particularly among private companies, has given investors and researchers confidence it\u2019s within reach.\nTake Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), for example. The startup announced in 2018 that its Spark reactor would exceed breakeven in 2025. Previously, when companies made proclamations like that, they were taken with a grain of salt. Now, attitudes have changed, in part because companies like Commonwealth have delivered on prior promises, a marked shift from ITER\u2019s continually slipping milestones.\n\u201cCommonwealth Fusion Systems has met every single milestone they set out so far, which provides a lot of confidence,\u201d said Saskia Mordijck, an associate professor of physics at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. \u201cI\u2019m fairly confident that for their construction, as long as they don\u2019t say otherwise, they will be on time.\u201d\nA majority of fusion startups like CFS have adopted a tokamak design, but even other companies that use inertial confinement or stellarators have leaped forward. \u201cThere are technological advances that have opened new pathways,\u201d Mordijck said.\nEvolutionary leaps\nThose technological advances drove a wave of changes in fusion research and led to a step-change in how quickly different approaches progressed. Work that had been plodding suddenly picked up the pace. It\u2019s the sort of shift that mirrors a theory in evolutionary biology known as punctuated equilibrium.\nPunctuated equilibrium describes how one species might remain relatively stable before undergoing a rapid explosion of changes that lead to a host of new species, known as a speciation event. Those changes can be brought about by a number of drivers, one of which is when a species\u2019 environment changes rapidly. The Chicxulub asteroid that brought about the end of the dinosaurs is a canonical example \u2014 small mammals suddenly had the run of the place and began to rapidly evolve.\nDaniel Levinthal thinks the theory also applies to the business world. A professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School, Levinthal did some early work porting over the evolutionary theory, and when asked whether the fusion sector\u2019s rapid advances resembled punctuated equilibrium, he agreed.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like young Einstein woke up with a new idea in fusion physics. It was more like, really bright, capable fusion people now have a better toolkit of supporting elements,\u201d he said. \u201cI think our lay inclination would be the former \u2014 that there was a breakthrough infusion, per se. And I\u2019m sure they\u2019ve gotten more clever, but the real critical binding constraints have been more relaxed around complementary technology.\u201d\nIn fusion\u2019s case, a trio of technological advances converged in the early 2010s to unleash a wave of innovation.\nOne was the continued shrinking of the transistor that\u2019s led to ever faster and more energy-efficient semiconductors. Fusion reactors will only work as long as they can contain their plasma, which can lose stability in the blink of an eye. To counter those changes, the reactor has to adjust its settings to modify the plasma\u2019s behavior. \u201cEvery fraction of a millisecond starts to count,\u201d said Michl Binderbauer, CEO of TAE Technologies. Earlier semiconductors were too slow, though that\u2019s changed in the last few years.\n\u201cI think you see this beautiful inflection point in this field where the science maturity and technical capability come together,\u201d he said.\nAll fusion startups harness this power, but the Wendelstein 7-X experimental reactor in Germany is one of the most prominent examples of how advanced semiconductors have driven fusion research forward. Initially switched on in 2015, the reactor has a stellarator design, which is basically a doughnut shape with added twists and undulations.\nEach twist and undulation, though, tweaks the reactor\u2019s performance in different ways and adds complexity to the design process. \u201cBecause you have so many options, which one do you pick?\u201d Mordijck said. The W7-X team modeled different permutations before building the machine, the first time a fusion reactor had been tested in silico before it had been built.\nMachine learning is another area where advanced semiconductors have benefited fusion research. Over the last few decades, increases in computing power have driven a resurgence in interest \u2014 and progress \u2014 in machine learning.\nWhen machine learning reached the fusion world, it sped progress in some key areas. After TAE built a new machine, Binderbauer said, the company would experiment with hundreds of settings to figure out how to get the most out of it. The process was slow and time-consuming.\nThen, the company started experimenting with machine learning. \u201cWhat used to take us two months \u2014 about 1,000 experiments to find optimum settings \u2014 we could now do in maybe three to four weeks,\u201d Binderbauer told TechCrunch. Stunned by the progress, Binderbauer pitched Google on a collaboration, which hit full stride in 2014. Now, he said, \u201cwe\u2019ve reduced that optimization problem to tens of experiments, which we can do in fractions of an afternoon.\u201d\nThe third technological leap was the ability to manufacture high-temperature superconductors (HTS) en masse. In tokamaks and other designs that rely on magnetic fields, superconductors allow scientists to ramp up the power of the magnetic field used to contain the plasma. High-temperature superconductors let them do so with less energy, helping to bring the break-even point within reach.\nSome of the first high-temperature superconducting materials were discovered in the 1980s, but they were brittle and hard to work with. ITER\u2019s design, which was set in 2001, proceeded with low-temperature superconductors that have to be cooled to negative 269 degrees Celsius using liquid helium. It wasn\u2019t until the 2010s that companies could reliably produce high-temperature superconducting magnets at lengths that could work for fusion reactors. (Similar techniques are widely used to produce semiconductors and certain kinds of solar panels.)\nHTS magnets are much more powerful than their low-temperature kin. \u201cThe stronger your magnet, the smaller the machine can be, because the strength of the magnet directly determines how well you will be able to kind of control your plasma,\u201d Mordijck said. Smaller machines are also cheaper and easier to build.\nThat, in turn, makes it easier for investors to envision the final product. \u201cWhat is the component-level advance that can build on the science that now makes a commercial reactor at least plausible? I would say it is the high-temperature superconducting magnet,\u201d Larochelle said.\nWithout the confluence of these three advances \u2014 computing speed, machine learning and HTS magnets \u2014 fusion would probably not be where it is today. After decades of stagnation, the last five to 10 years have been a period of rapid speciation, characteristic of the theory of punctuated equilibrium. Fusion startups that have been around for years have gotten a second wind, and new ones have popped up to explore previously underexploited niches.\nTen to 15 years is still a ways out, but for some investors, it\u2019s the right time to get involved.\n\u201cThe reason to be excited about fusion now is the same reason to be excited about computers in the 1940s when someone invented the transistor,\u201d Larochelle said."

      "text": "General Fusion, a Canadian nuclear fusion energy startup, announced today that it had been thrown a lifeline in the form of $22 million in fresh funding.\nThe company had laid off at least 25% of its employees in May in a bid to shore up its stretched finances. At the same time, CEO Greg Twinney wrote an open letter pleading for funding. The additional cash will give General Fusion some breathing room, though not much.\nA subset of General Fusion\u2019s existing investors ultimately ponied up for what The Globe and Mail reports was a \u201cpay to play\u201d round \u2014 a financing structure where existing investors must participate to maintain their ownership stakes \u2014 that included Chrysalix Venture Capital, Gaingels, Hatch, MILFAM, JIMCO, PenderFund, Presight Capital, Segra Capital Management, and Thistledown Capital. PenderFund and Segra gained board seats as part of the deal.\nThough the company described the round as \u201coversubscribed,\u201d the $22 million falls far short of the $125 million that the company was reportedly seeking. Adam Rodman, chief investment officer at Segra Capital, told The Globe and Mail that the $22 million was \u201cthe least amount of capital possible\u201d to help the company hit the next scientific milestone.\nGeneral Fusion was founded in 2002 and before this round had raised $440 million, according to PitchBook.\nJust months before making its financial woes public, General Fusion had activated its latest device, Lawson Machine 26 (LM26), a half-scale prototype of a commercial-scale reactor. The new funding will give the company more time to run LM26 as it attempts to hit key scientific milestones.\nGeneral Fusion is pursuing what\u2019s known as \u201cmagnetized target fusion.\u201d Inside its reactor, electricity flows through deuterium-tritium fuel \u2014 heavy hydrogen isotopes \u2014 generating a magnetic field to contain the plasma. That plasma is then compressed by a liquid lithium wall that is pressed inward by steam-driven pistons. The combination should drive the temperature and pressure inside the plasma high enough to trigger a fusion reaction.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Reaching scientific breakeven is crucial in proving the viability of a reactor design, though it doesn\u2019t guarantee commercial success.\nToday, General Fusion said it is still pursuing scientific breakeven, though it didn\u2019t provide a timeline. The company also listed two intermediary goals: heating plasmas to 10 million degrees Celsius and 100 million degrees Celsius.\nGiven the limited size of the fresh funding, it seems likely that General Fusion will shoot for the most achievable milestones to convince investors to cut a new round of checks.

The company announced Tuesday that it had raised $125 million to continue development of the reactor design and expand its TE Magnetics division.\nTokamak Energy has been working on fusion since 2009, when it was spun out from the U.K. Atomic Energy Authority. The startup is pursuing what\u2019s known as magnetic confinement fusion, which uses magnets to corral searing-hot plasma inside a reactor. This forces the plasma into a doughnut shape, but unlike other approaches, Tokamak Energy\u2019s spherical tokamak takes that doughnut and squeezes it at the circumference. Its ST40 prototype generated a record-setting 100 million degree Celsius plasma in 2022.\nTokamak Energy is aiming to operate a pilot power plant starting by 2034, the Telegraph reported, which puts it approximately on par with several other fusion startups, though several years behind frontrunners like Commonwealth Fusion Systems.\nTo help bridge the gap until commercial fusion revenue rolls in, Tokamak Energy launched a division, TE Magnetics, to sell its expertise in high-temperature superconducting magnets, a business model that\u2019s becoming more widespread among fusion startups.\nThe company has raised a total $275 million from private investors, including this week\u2019s raise, which was led by East X Ventures and Lingotto Investment Management, which is backed by the Agnelli family, with participation from British Patient Capital, BW Group, Furukawa Electric Company, and Sabanci Climate Ventures."

      "text": "When it comes to fusion power, there are two basic approaches: One, create a small star here on Earth that\u2019s held in place by powerful magnetic fields. Two, use intense lasers to make a succession of even smaller stars, but repeat the process several times per second.\nMoritz von der Linden, the co-founder and CEO of Marvel Fusion, likes his odds with the latter. In a world racing to wean itself off fossil fuels, fusion power promises to be an effectively limitless supply of energy, using widely available materials to re-create conditions that are hotter than the surface of the sun.\nBut most analysts believe commercial fusion power is still at least a decade away, and it\u2019s up against renewable energy and battery storage, which continue to grow cheaper by the year. \u201cFusion has to come fast and it has to come cheap,\u201d von der Linden told TechCrunch. \u201cOtherwise nobody needs it, and nobody will be willing to pay for it.\u201d\nMarvel Fusion is one of several companies pursuing what\u2019s known as inertial confinement fusion. It\u2019s the same basic approach used at the National Ignition Facility (NIF), a Department of Energy lab that proved in 2022 that controlled fusion reactions could generate more power than it took to ignite them. That\u2019s a helpful milestone for any startup chasing the thus-far-elusive technology.\nBut where NIF\u2019s lasers are based on decades-old designs, Marvel is using cutting-edge technology to improve its lasers\u2019 power and efficiency. The startup will soon build a demonstration facility in collaboration with Colorado State University, where it hopes two 100-Joule lasers will prove its core technology. Shovels hit the dirt on October 16, and von der Linden expects it\u2019ll be operational by early 2027.\nThose lasers will fire faster than the blink of an eye \u2014 in the femtosecond range, or one-billionth of second \u2014 bombarding a nanostructured target with photons that blast away its electrons and scatter the remaining positively charged ions. Those ions will then hit Marvel\u2019s fuel, igniting a fusion reaction. Currently, Marvel Fusion is using a mix of mainly hydrogen and boron, though von der Linden says the company is taking a \u201cmixed fuel\u201d approach to keep its options open should a more advantageous combination come along.\nCompared with NIF\u2019s fuel pellet, which is ensconced in a one-centimeter gold hohlraum that takes two weeks to manufacture and load, Marvel\u2019s fuel and target were designed for mass manufacturing. The fuel itself is solid at room temperature, making it simpler to handle than NIF\u2019s fuel, which relies on either gaseous or cryogenically frozen hydrogen isotopes. Marvel\u2019s target is simpler, too, with nanostructures made of silicon, not gold.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

We can use standard lithography from chip manufacturing.\u2019\u201d At the dimensions Marvel intends to manufacture, about 50 to 80 nanometers per feature, the company can use semiconductor manufacturing equipment that\u2019s up to a decade old. It can produce around 5,000 targets on a standard 300-millimeter wafer.\nIf the Colorado experiments go as planned, the company will increase the lasers\u2019 energy and multiply their number in another facility starting in 2028 or 2029. \u201cWith 20 lasers, we have the ability to really engineer the acceleration of the ions,\u201d von der Linden said.\nTo hit those milestones, Marvel recently raised \u20ac62.8 million in a Series B round, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. HV Capital led the round with participation from b2venture, Bayern Kapital, Deutsche Telekom, Earlybird, SPRIND, and Tengelmann Ventures. The company was also selected by the European Innovation Council for a \u20ac2.5 million grant and up to \u20ac15 million in equity investment, which if made will be an extension of this round.\nMarvel\u2019s first prototype should be finalized around 2032 or 2033, von der Linden said, and it will contain hundreds of kilojoule-class lasers. Each will fire around 10 times per second.\nThat\u2019ll be the moment of truth. While the company\u2019s Colorado facility will be a useful milestone, \u201cit\u2019s like driving a Ferrari with a two-cylinder engine,\u201d von der Linden said. \u201cIt will move, but it won\u2019t do what it\u2019s supposed to do,\u201d which in Marvel\u2019s case is generate useful amounts of power. If the full-scale prototype fires on all, er, lasers, then the startup has a chance of crossing the fusion finish line. The race is on."

To date, it has raised about $1.8 billion, according to PitchBook, making it one of the highest funded fusion companies.\nTAE, formerly known as Tri Alpha Energy, worked for years in stealth developing its reactor design. The company initially used a process that started by firing two plasma balls at each other and then spinning the resulting blob with particle beams. The plasma blob \u2014 which looks like a hollow cigar \u2014 generates its own magnetic field, working alongside the reactor\u2019s magnets to keep the plasma contained.\nIn April, the company announced it no longer needed to fire two plasma balls to kick off a reaction. Instead, it was able to form a plasma, heat it, and stabilize it using the particle beams alone. Eliminating that equipment makes the reactor smaller, cheaper, and easier to operate, TAE said.\nGoogle has participated in two rounds of investment in TAE; the previous $250 million round closed in 2022. The tech company has been working with TAE for longer. Since 2014, Google computer scientists have worked with engineers at TAE to use machine learning (a form of AI) to find the ideal settings for a fusion device.\nBefore AI, the optimization process used to take two months \u2014 \u201cabout 1,000 experiments,\u201d TAE CEO Michl Binderbauer told me in 2022.

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions. And I think about companies in the same way\u2014there are these crucible moments that have an enormous bearing on ultimate outcomes.\nRoelof's Sessions\nWhat Sequoia Sees Coming Next\nAs one of the most influential VCs of the modern era, Roelof Botha has seen it all; booms, busts, and billion-dollar breakout bets.

      "text": "General Fusion laid off at least 25% of its employees last week, just days after hitting a key milestone for its latest fusion demonstration device.\nCEO Greg Twinney posted an open letter on the company\u2019s website Monday saying that while its new LM26 device had been able to compress a plasma \u2014 something necessary for fusion conditions \u2014 General Fusion was running short of money. He wrote, \u201c[T]oday\u2019s funding landscape is more challenging than ever as investors and governments navigate a rapidly shifting and uncertain political and market climate.\u201d\nThe 23-year-old company, which many still describe as a startup, is Canada\u2019s leading entrant in the race for commercial fusion power. It has raised $440 million, according to PitchBook, including a $22.66 million round that closed in July. Backers include Jeff Bezos, Temasek, and BDC Capital. But that money hasn\u2019t been enough for the company to show that its unique approach to fusion is viable.\nGeneral Fusion\u2019s plight highlights the challenges that face the fusion industry.\nTo date, only one device has been able to hit so-called scientific breakeven, a milestone that\u2019s significant historically but not commercially. To hit commercial breakeven, reactors need to produce dozens of times more energy than has been demonstrated so far.\nThe road to those milestones has proven extraordinarily costly. Though General Fusion\u2019s tally may seem impressive, it is middle of the pack. Commonwealth Fusion Systems has raised over $2 billion, Helion has pulled in over $1 billion, and upstart Pacific Fusion has been pledged $900 million in its Series A alone.\nPart of General Fusion\u2019s challenge is that it\u2019s taking a different approach than many of its competitors.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

The former uses magnetic fields to control plasma, squeezing it until it reaches the conditions for nuclei to fuse. The latter approach typically uses lasers to compress a fuel pellet.\nGeneral Fusion, on the other hand, has been trying to use steam-driven pistons to compress fusion fuel. The U.S. Navy tried something similar in the 1970s to no avail, but General Fusion thinks that modern computers could solve some of the timing problems that plagued earlier attempts. It has yet to show that\u2019s the case, but it has said that if completed, LM26 should be able to reach scientific breakeven.\nNow the company will have to raise more money \u2014 and quickly \u2014 if it wants to prove its approach is a viable competitor."

      "text": "Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS) marked a major milestone Tuesday morning, announcing the installation of a key component of its SPARC demonstration reactor.\nThe new part is a 24-foot wide, 75-ton stainless steel circle that forms the foundation of the tokamak, the doughnut-shaped heart of a fusion reactor that CFS hopes will be the first of its kind to generate more power than it consumes. Called the cryostat base, it was made in Italy and shipped halfway around the world to CFS\u2019s site in Devens, Massachusetts.\n\u201cIt is the first piece of the actual fusion machine,\u201d Alex Creely, director of tokamak operations at CFS, told TechCrunch. Work at the site has been underway now for more than three years as the company constructs the buildings and machinery that will support the reactor\u2019s core.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal for us, because it means we\u2019re transitioning into a new stage of the project where we\u2019re not building an industrial facility \u2014 we\u2019re still doing that a bit \u2014 but we\u2019re also now building the actual tokamak itself,\u201d he said.\nCFS is one of many startups that have emerged in recent years to pursue fusion power, which promises to deliver gigawatts of pollution-free electricity from a hydrogen fuel derived from seawater. Investors have been counting on the technology to meet future power needs, which are skyrocketing as heavy users like electric vehicles and data centers proliferate.\nThe company, which is backed by Bill Gates\u2019 Breakthrough Energy Ventures, among other investors, is widely considered to be one of the best prospects to prove whether fusion power is commercially feasible. The company announced in December that its first commercial-scale reactor will be located outside Richmond, Virginia.\nSparc is expected to come online in 2027, and if it works as CFS anticipates, it could be the first tokamak to produce more power than it takes to run. So far, only the Department of Energy\u2019s National Ignition Facility has been able to hit so-called scientific break-even in a string of successful experiments, the first of which occurred in December 2022.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

CFS\u2019s tokamak uses magnets to herd 100 million degree C plasma into a tight doughnut shape, confining and compressing it until fusion occurs.\nTokamaks use superconducting magnets to generate the powerful magnetic fields required to coral the plasma. Those magnets need to be cooled to \u2013253 degrees C using liquid helium. The cryostat helps maintain those frigid conditions, acting like a thermos by insulating it from ambient temperatures. \u201cThe cryostat base is basically like the bottom of the thermos,\u201d Creely said.\nJust like someone receiving an Amazon package, CFS had to unbox and inspect the cryostat base before installing it. But unlike an e-commerce package that takes a few seconds to open, it took the CFS team a few days to remove the shipping material and another week \u201cjust to make sure that nothing got damaged in shipping,\u201d Creely said.\nThe CFS team then moved the cryostat base to the tokamak hall, where precisely placed bolts protruded from the concrete foundation awaiting the stainless steel disk. \u201cThen you grout it in,\u201d he said.\nAlongside the cryostat base, work continues on the other three major pieces of the tokamak, which will be assembled simultaneously into their final configuration either late this year or early next year. After that, CFS will ensure all the pieces are working together as planned, a process known as commissioning, which will take months.\n\u201cThis is the first of a kind,\u201d Creely said. \u201cThere\u2019s not just like an on button and it turns on.\u201d"

      "text": "Pacific Fusion made a splash in October when it emerged from stealth with a $900 million Series A and a founding team led by a scientist who is most widely known for his work on the Human Genome Project.\nNow, the startup is revealing the physics that underpin its plans to build a fusion reactor.\n\u201cWe\u2019re publishing our detailed technical roadmap,\u201d Will Regan, co-founder and president of Pacific Fusion, told TechCrunch. \u201cWe lay out the details of the system that\u2019s going to let us get 100x the gain of what the [National Ignition Facility] can do at about one-tenth the cost.\u201d\nThe bet is a long-term one: The company said that the first commercial reactor is about a decade away.\nPacific Fusion follows a similar path to fusion power as the National Ignition Facility (NIF), the Department of Energy research program that was the first to demonstrate that a controlled fusion reaction could release more energy than was required to initiate the reaction. The approach is called inertial confinement, which means the fuel is squeezed to the point where atoms start fusing with one another, releasing tremendous amounts of power in the process.\nBut where the NIF uses lasers to compress the fuel pellet, Pacific Fusion plans to send a massive pulse of electricity into a target, generating a magnetic field that\u2019ll cause a shell encasing the fuel to compress in about 100 nanoseconds.\nGenerating the electricity will be 156 impedance-matched Marx generators (IMG), or pulser modules, a power source invented by co-founder Keith LeChien and others. Together, the pulser modules produce 2 terawatts for 100 nanoseconds. \u201cThat\u2019s about 4x the average power of the U.S. grid,\u201d Regan said.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nEach pulser module contains repeating elements. There are 32 \u201cstages,\u201d which are essentially rings of metal surrounded by 10 \u201cbricks.\u201d Each brick consists of a switch and two capacitors, which are short-term energy storage devices.\nEnsuring that the electricity from each brick reaches the fuel pellet at the same time requires exact timing \u2014 a single capacitor will dump all its energy in only about 100 nanoseconds, Regan said. \u201cOur version of the Marx generator, the IMG, is something that is inherently fast pulse,\u201d he said. \u201cThat timing is consistent throughout the entire system because we synchronize it.\u201d\nOnce the bricks discharge, the electricity will travel down cables from each pulser module to the reaction chamber, which will be kept at vacuum. There, the surges will converge around the target, applying electromagnetic force that will squeeze it until fusion occurs.\nSo far, Pacific Fusion is \u201cseveral months ahead of schedule,\u201d Regan said, having developed the necessary simulation models and built completed prototypes of the bricks and stages. That allows the company to unlock the next portion of their $900 million funding round, which will go toward building a complete pulse module, or IMG.\n\u201cOnce we do that, we basically carbon copy it 150 times to make a whole system,\u201d he said.\nThe funding round, while massive by Series A standards, isn\u2019t accessible all at once. It\u2019s built to pay out serially as the company hits certain milestones. Large rounds doled out in tranches are common in biotech, though not in other sectors. Credit for the startup\u2019s funding model, Regan said, goes to investors at General Catalyst, co-founder and CEO Eric Lander, and co-founder and COO Carrie von Muench, who were all familiar with its use in biotech.\nPacific Fusion also recently hired Sachin Desai as general counsel, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Desai had previously served in the same capacity at a competitor, Helion.\nFusion doesn\u2019t have the same regulatory concerns as fission, and it received some added clarity with the passage of the Advance Act in July 2024, which lays out a regulatory framework for fusion that\u2019s different from fission.\nBut since there are no commercial fusion reactors in existence, there are still many unanswered questions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just important that we\u2019re always in the room and we\u2019re part of the conversation as rules are made,\u201d Regan said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an ongoing process.\u201d"

In a flash, the cylinder vaporized, emitting X-rays that bombarded the fuel pellet, turning its outer diamond layer into an expanding plasma that compressed the fuel inside to the point where its nuclei fused and released a tremendous amount of energy.\nHow much energy?\nWhen the BB-sized fuel pellet ignited and produced a sustained fusion reaction, it released about 50% more energy than was imparted by the experiment\u2019s lasers \u2014 the world\u2019s largest and most energetic laser system. The lasers\u2019 energy heated the fuel pellet to 150 million degrees Celsius and compressed it with a pressure over twice that found at the sun\u2019s center.\nIn specific terms, the lasers put in 2.05 megajoules of energy and the fusion reaction released 3.15 megajoules. That\u2019s even better than leaked reports suggested. The team at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory spent the last week deciphering the data to determine the exact results.\nOnly 4% of the deuterium-tritium fuel burned in the fusion reaction, suggesting plenty of room for improvement. The gold cylinder took about two weeks to manufacture, and the diamond-coated fuel pellet took about seven months to produce.\nIn scientific and technical terms, the reaction is considered net positive. In real-world terms, it produced far less power than what would be expected of a commercial power plant. To produce the 2.05-megajoule shot, the laser system required 300 megajoules of power, Kim Budil, director of LLNL, said in a press conference today.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nStill, Budil said that the team sees a way to get to \u201chundreds of megajoules of output\u201d per shot, an amount that would be required for a commercial-scale power plant using the technique, known as inertial confinement.\n\u201cWe need the private sector to get into the game,\u201d Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said.\nWhile a few fusion startups are focused on inertial confinement, the majority are pursuing magnetic confinement, which uses powerful superconducting magnets to corral burning plasma to the temperatures and pressures required for fusion.\nThe fundamental underlying physics are the same for the two approaches, but the rest of the science and engineering challenges are quite different. In the fusion research world, magnetic confinement is considered low temperature and low pressure, whereas inertial confinement is high temperature and high pressure. Still, there are many places where work on one side benefits the other and vice versa, Carolyn Kuranz, an experimental plasma physicist at the University of Michigan, told TechCrunch yesterday.\nThe opportunities for shared knowledge have investors heartened, too. \u201cFusion science has been making steady progress toward energy breakeven on a number of fronts for decades,\u201d said Phil Larochelle, a partner at Breakthrough Energy Ventures. \u201cWe expect other approaches to make similar breakthroughs this decade, paving the way for commercial plants in the near future.\u201d\nThe team had a hunch that last week\u2019s shot would be a good one, though they had no idea just how good until the diagnostic data started rolling in. The first thing that principal experimentalist Alex Zylstra did when he saw the initial data was to call a diagnostic expert to double-check whether it was really as good as he thought.\nBy the morning, the rest of the team woke up to the promising news, and by the next week, they knew they had achieved a world first.\nThe shot was the result of refinements put in place after successful experiments in August 2021 and earlier this year. The string of successes was enabled not only by data from previous experiments, but also machine learning trained on that data, Budil said.\nWhen it comes to a timeline for commercializing inertial confinement, Budil remains a realist but is growing increasingly optimistic. Now that the theory has been proven, she sees where specific advancements, from targeting improvements to laser efficiencies, could help bring it to market.\nCommercial fusion remains \u201cprobably decades away,\u201d she said. \u201cNot six or five as we used to say, but moving into the foreground. A few decades of research into the underlying technologies could put us in the realm of a commercial power plant.\u201d"

      "text": "Commercial nuclear fusion power isn\u2019t a reality yet. But venture capital is flowing into startups that promise that clean, safe, and virtually limitless energy is no longer just a distant dream.\nMost fusion companies that have raised over $100 million are based in the United States. Not Proxima Fusion, a German startup that has just secured a \u20ac130 million Series A round of funding (approximately $148 million) led by Balderton Capital and Cherry Ventures.\nThis brings Proxima\u2019s public and private funding to over \u20ac185 million ($200 million), increasing its chances to be one of Europe\u2019s top contenders in the race for an alternative to fission, one which does not depend on uranium or other imported fissile materials used in current nuclear reactors.\nThe pursuit isn\u2019t solely for scientific prestige; it is deeply intertwined with energy security. \u201cWait for the early 2030s and you will see fusion giants in each geopolitical block,\u201d Proxima\u2019s CEO and co-founder Francesco Sciortino predicted in an interview with TechCrunch.\nUntil now, Proxima didn\u2019t have the means to become such a giant; its April 2024 seed round was only \u20ac20 million ($21.7 million). Since then Proxima published its plans for a working fusion power plant in a peer-reviewed journal.\nThe paper made the case for stellarators, a type of reactor that uses magnetic fields to confine hot plasma into a ring long enough for fusion to occur. Unlike their main alternative, tokamaks, stellarators\u2019 twisted rings don\u2019t require a plasma current, making them more stable. Building upon its proximity to the world\u2019s largest stellarator, Germany\u2019s Wendelstein 7-X, Proxima came up with its own Stellaris design, a significant milestone detailed in the paper.\nThe hefty new funding was partly a reflection of reaching this milestone in half the time it had originally told investors, Sciortino said. With an oversubscribed round, the company had its pick. \u201cNow we have the right kind of partners not just for this stage, but to finance us in the next stage.\u201d\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Balderton raised $1.3 billion in 2024 for its Early Stage Fund IX and its Growth Fund II. As for Cherry, it closed its latest fund at $500 million in February 2025, to be split between early-stage and follow-ons at Series B and beyond.\nSciortino estimates that it will need venture capital as an investment category \u201cto bring [Proxima] to 2031, give or take.\u201d After that point, the company expects to seek other forms of capital. But before then, it will need the capital to meet big milestones, including a critical hardware demonstration scheduled for 2027. In his view, the funding was made possible by the understanding \u201cthat this is not an infinitely long journey for our current investors.\u201d\nBy the rules of venture capital, investors may be less convinced that fusion will happen on that timeline, but they are willing to bet. Ian Hogarth, a partner at founders-led fund Plural, has now invested in Proxima three times, and calls it a \u201cbig shot.\u201d\nA nuclear fusion future is particularly appealing for the Old Continent. \u201cProxima represents an opportunity to decarbonize and provide a stable baseload for all the downstream energy needs the world has, and for Europe to play a global leadership role in driving the energy transition,\u201d Hogarth told TechCrunch.\nProxima\u2019s cap table is once again very European, with participants in the round including Bayern Kapital, Club degli Investitori, DeepTech & Climate Fonds (DTCF), Elaia, HTGF, Leitmotif, Lightspeed, OMNES Capital, redalpine, Visionaries Tomorrow, and UVC Partners.\n\u201cWe consider Proxima to be thoroughly European and not just German,\u201d Sciortino said. Proxima has its headquarters and lab in Munich, where it spun off from the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics (IPP). But it also has teams at Switzerland\u2019s Paul Scherrer Institute and at the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, the U.K.\u2019s national laboratory for fusion research near Oxford.\nSciortino himself, a physicist by background, is originally from Italy, but worked on fusion research in the U.K., Switzerland, and then at MIT in the U.S. There were several reasons for him to move back to Europe, but one of them speaks to a sentiment echoed by investors: \u201cI\u2019m a fairly proud European, and always wanted to think that there is a future on this continent that somebody has to build.\u201d\nNote: This story was updated to add the full list of investors involved in the round."

      "text": "Conner Galloway and Alexander Valys have followed developments in nuclear fusion research since they were roommates at MIT some 20 years ago. For much of that time, it wasn\u2019t the most exciting pastime: Breakthroughs were few and far between, and commercial fusion remained perpetually on the horizon, always 20 years away from providing inexpensive, inexhaustible, and pollution-free power.\nBut then in August 2021, the two spotted some news that suggested fusion power was finally within reach. Scientists working on a certain type of nuclear fusion at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) had doubled their previous best result.\nThough it went largely unnoticed in the popular press, Galloway and Valys knew it marked a turning point. \u201cThat was one of the key moments. It\u2019s like, okay, now\u2019s the time,\u201d Valys told TechCrunch.\nSpurred into action, Galloway started refining his plans for what would become Xcimer Energy, a startup he founded in January 2022. Valys joined that April, and since then the two have been quietly working with their team to draw up plans for a fusion power plant that they say has the best shot at providing commercial-scale power.\n\u201cThe type of inertial fusion we\u2019re pursuing has the best long-term economics,\u201d Galloway said.\nXcimer is pursuing what\u2019s known as inertial confinement fusion. It\u2019s the same type used by the NIF, which proved in December 2022 that controlled nuclear fusion could produce more power than was required to initiate the reaction. In inertial confinement, a laser is fired on a small fuel pellet, compressing and heating it to the point where its deuterium and tritium atoms start fusing, releasing tremendous amounts of energy in the process.\nBut Xcimer has been pursuing what\u2019s best described as a ground-up redesign of the underlying technology.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nIt starts with the laser: Xcimer\u2019s design is newer and promises to be more powerful. Where the power of NIF\u2019s system tops out at around 2 megajoules, the startup is targeting 10 megajoules for its commercial-scale design. What\u2019s more, Xcimer\u2019s design should be significantly cheaper to build and operate. It\u2019s similar in principle to the kind that has been used for years in semiconductor manufacturing, and the way it focuses the laser beam is based on research performed as part of the 1980s Strategic Defense Initiative, sometimes called Star Wars.\nWhile many inertial confinement proposals suggest shooting the laser at several fuel pellets per second, Galloway said Xcimer plans to fire one every few seconds.\nThe inside of Xcimer\u2019s reactor will look a little different, too. The fusion explosions will occur inside a waterfall of molten salt instead of a steel-walled reactor. The flowing salt will absorb the energy of the reaction and help generate steam to power a turbine. The hellish-sounding waterfall has a nice side benefit, too, protecting the reactor walls from damage, something that\u2019s a primary concern for other designs. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to replace the first wall at all during the plant lifetime,\u201d Galloway said. \u201cIt can last 30 years with one chamber.\u201d\nDespite being just two years old, Xcimer has a 10-year timeline to get to a pilot plant that it says will prove its commercial-scale ambitions aren\u2019t just theoretical.\nFor the next two years, the company is building a demonstration-scale version of its laser system, which the company calls Phoenix. Though this demo won\u2019t hit 10 megajoules, it\u2019ll be similar enough to prove the cost savings, Valys said.\nTo get through that phase, Xcimer has raised a $100 million Series A, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. The round was led by Hedosophia, with participation by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Emerson Collective, Gigascale Capital, Lowercarbon Capital, Prelude Ventures and Starlight Ventures. The startup also has a $9 million milestone-based grant from the Department of Energy.\n\u201cThat takes us through the demonstration of this entire prototype laser system and through our goals for further development of the technology and roadmap for the rest of the plant,\u201d Valys said. \u201cIt also is more than enough for the initial phase of the DOE milestone program.\u201d\nThe two friends are confident their 10-year timeline will work out. \u201cThis is proven science,\u201d Galloway said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of building a big enough laser, cheap enough laser and efficient enough laser.\u201d"
