      "summary": "Euro‑zone inflation data showed producer and consumer prices above forecasts, yet ECB board member Isabel Schnabel signaled no need to cut rates, keeping the euro stable. In the U.S., a sharp decline in job openings and a surplus of unemployed people have softened expectations of Fed rate cuts, while the tech sector’s rebound lifted the Nasdaq and S&P 500, boosting Treasury yields and gold to a new high. The dollar weakened broadly, falling 0.4% against sterling and the Aussie dollar, and oil prices dropped 2.5% amid OPEC’s consideration of an output hike. Meanwhile, China’s yuan has strengthened against the dollar, a deliberate policy move that may serve as leverage in U.S. trade negotiations and support domestic consumption.",
