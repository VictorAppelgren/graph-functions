  "title": "HALEY KENNINGTON: Meet Democrats' \u2014 And China\u2019s \u2014 New Favorite Republican",
  "description": "Roger Alford decided he knew better than the DOJ and national security team and attempted to block a merger that would strengthen America against China.",
  "content": "Whenever liberals start describing a Republican as brave or principled, you can be sure it\u2019s because he or she is stabbing the party in the back.\n\nMeet Democrats\u2019 latest hero Roger Alford. He was deputy assistant attorney general for antitrust until AG Pam Bondi recently fired him for insubordination.\n\nAlford decided he knew better than the Trump administration\u2019s DOJ and national security team and attempted to block a merger that would strengthen America against China.\n\nNow, he is banging pots and pans, metaphorically auditioning to be MSNBC\u2019s new favorite \u201cRepublican.\u201d\n\nThe merger in question was between two telecom companies, HPE and Juniper, which Trump intelligence officials urged the DOJ to clear for national security reasons \u2014 specifically, to protect the Republic from the Chinese Communist Party. (RELATED: DOJ Deep Stater Cosplaying As MAGA Has Ties To Chinese Interests)\n\nHuawei, a Chinese firm that receives substantial subsidies from that country\u2019s communist government, and which the FBI has said can disrupt U.S. military communications, currently controls around 30% of the global telecom equipment market. Huawei products are banned in the U.S., but Huawei\u2019s dominance abroad leaves many of our allies vulnerable to Chinese cyberespionage. Trump intelligence officials told the DOJ that they strongly believe an HPE-Juniper deal would help mitigate that exposure by creating a new, larger company that can compete with Huawei globally.\n\nThis is all pretty straightforward. But Alford had other ideas.\n\nIn a speech dripping with holier-than-thou self-importance, he claimed the deal only went through because a \u201ccabal of MAGA-In-Name-Only lobbyists and DOJ officials\u201d were working behind the scenes \u201cto exert and expand their influence and enrich themselves. Never once in his speech did he mention that Trump\u2019s senior intelligence officials urged the DOJ to clear the merger.\n\nClaims like these are catnip for Democrats. Vox gave the speech a glowing write-up. David Dayen, executive editor of the progressive American Prospect, gushed that Alford is a \u201cno-doubt conservative\u201d who is nevertheless \u201ccursed with having a sense of right and wrong.\u201d\n\nWhen Mitt Romney ran for president, the media absurdly called him a homophobic bully and animal abuser. But when he voted to remove President Trump from office, he suddenly became a genuine profile in courage.\n\nTo this crowd, Dick Cheney was a genocidal war criminal \u2014 until he endorsed Kamala Harris.\n\nRobert Mueller was just another Republican insider \u2014 until he was tapped to investigate Trump. Then the media slapped his face on prayer candles, and fashion blogs drooled over his Brooks Brothers suits.\n\nIt\u2019s the same tired playbook every time: find a Republican willing to knife Trump or his agenda and turn him into a temporary folk hero.\n\nThe liberal media are desperate to elevate Alford because they want to turn the HPE-Juniper deal into a major headache for the Trump administration. Signalgate fizzled, so now they\u2019re jonesing for a second bite at the apple.\n\nDayen practically salivated over Alford\u2019s use of the word \u201cscandal\u201d to describe the DOJ approval.\n\nUnfortunately for the Dems, the \u201cHPE-Juniper merger scandal\u201d is a giant nothingburger.\n\nAlford can make all the insinuations he wants about shady lobbyists and smoke-filled rooms, but the truth is that senior U.S. intelligence officials have already gone on the record to set things straight.\n\n\u201cIn light of significant national security concerns, a settlement [greenlighting the deal] \u2026 serves the interests of the United States by strengthening domestic capabilities and is critical to countering Huawei and China,\u201d one official told Axios last month.\n\nThat should be case closed \u2014 unless, of course, you\u2019re a disgruntled ex-official chasing headlines.\n\nIn response to Alford\u2019s speech, a DOJ spokesperson called him \u201cthe James Comey of antitrust,\u201d a bitter bureaucrat \u201cpursuing blind self-promotion and ego.\u201d\n\nAnd here\u2019s what the media won\u2019t tell you: The Daily Caller reported Wednesday that in 2016, Alford gave a speech at a Chinese university attacking then-candidate Trump\u2019s tough stance toward Beijing.\n\nAccording to a summary of that speech, Alford told his Chinese audience that \u201cTrump fundamentally distrusts basic tenets of free trade.\u201d\n\nWell, of course he does \u2014 at least when it comes to China. Anyone who believes in \u201cfree trade\u201d with a communist dictatorship that uses currency manipulation, government subsidies, intellectual property theft, and even slave labor is dangerously na\u00efve.\n\nSo let\u2019s be clear: Alford wasn\u2019t just butting heads with Pam Bondi on antitrust. He was actively undercutting Trump\u2019s national security strategy\u2014propping up the same failed globalist playbook that let China steamroll American workers for decades.\n\nAlford\u2019s career as a \u201cprincipled Republican\u201d media celebrity is probably just getting started. The \u201cscandal\u201d he\u2019s pushing, on the other hand, is dead on arrival. Even Trump\u2019s intelligence officials have already stated that the deal is crucial to outmaneuvering Huawei. That should be the end of the story.\n\nSuppose Roger Alford wants to be MSNBC\u2019s next \u201cprincipled conservative\u201d contributor, fine. But let\u2019s not pretend he\u2019s putting America first. He\u2019s putting China first \u2014 and Democrats couldn\u2019t be happier about it.\n\nHaley Kennington (@LadyKennington) is an investigative journalist and conservative commentator.

      "text": "On paper, it looked like a fantastic deal. In 2017, the Chinese government was offering to spend $100 million to build an ornate Chinese garden at the National Arboretum in Washington DC. Complete with temples, pavilions and a 70-foot white pagoda, the project thrilled local officials, who hoped it would attract thousands of tourists every year.\nBut when US counterintelligence officials began digging into the details, they found numerous red flags. The pagoda, they noted, would have been strategically placed on one of the highest points in Washington DC, just two miles from the US Capitol, a perfect spot for signals intelligence collection, multiple sources familiar with the episode told CNN.\nAlso alarming was that Chinese officials wanted to build the pagoda with materials shipped to the US in diplomatic pouches, which US Customs officials are barred from examining, the sources said.\nFederal officials quietly killed the project before construction was underway. The Wall Street Journal first reported about the security concerns in 2018.\nThe canceled garden is part of a frenzy of counterintelligence activity by the FBI and other federal agencies focused on what career US security officials say has been a dramatic escalation of Chinese espionage on US soil over the past decade.\nSince at least 2017, federal officials have investigated Chinese land purchases near critical infrastructure, shut down a high-profile regional consulate believed by the US government to be a hotbed of Chinese spies and stonewalled what they saw as clear efforts to plant listening devices near sensitive military and government facilities.\nAmong the most alarming things the FBI uncovered pertains to Chinese-made Huawei equipment atop cell towers near US military bases in the rural Midwest. According to multiple sources familiar with the matter, the FBI determined the equipment was capable of capturing and disrupting highly restricted Defense Department communications, including those used by US Strategic Command, which oversees the country\u2019s nuclear weapons.\nWhile broad concerns about Huawei equipment near US military installations have been well known, the existence of this investigation and its findings have never been reported. Its origins stretch back to at least the Obama administration. It was described to CNN by more than a dozen sources, including current and former national security officials, all of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.\nIt\u2019s unclear if the intelligence community determined whether any data was actually intercepted and sent back to Beijing from these towers. Sources familiar with the issue say that from a technical standpoint, it\u2019s incredibly difficult to prove a given package of data was stolen and sent overseas.\nThe Chinese government strongly denies any efforts to spy on the US. Huawei in a statement to CNN also denied that its equipment is capable of operating in any communications spectrum allocated to the Defense Department.\nBut multiple sources familiar with the investigation tell CNN that there\u2019s no question the Huawei equipment has the ability to intercept not only commercial cell traffic but also the highly restricted airwaves used by the military and disrupt critical US Strategic Command communications, giving the Chinese government a potential window into America\u2019s nuclear arsenal.\n\u201cThis gets into some of the most sensitive things we do,\u201d said one former FBI official with knowledge of the investigation. \u201cIt would impact our ability for essentially command and control with the nuclear triad. \u201cThat goes into the \u2018BFD\u2019 category.\u201d\n\u201cIf it is possible for that to be disrupted, then that is a very bad day,\u201d this person added.\nTurning doves into hawks\nFormer officials described the probe\u2019s findings as a watershed moment. The investigation was so secret that some senior policymakers in the White House and elsewhere in government weren\u2019t briefed on its existence until 2019, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\nThat fall, the Federal Communications Commission initiated a rule that effectively banned small telecoms from using Huawei and a few other brands of Chinese made-equipment. \u201cThe existence of the investigation at the highest levels turned some doves into hawks,\u201d said one former US official.\nIn 2020, Congress approved $1.9 billion to remove Chinese-made Huawei and ZTE cellular technology across wide swaths of rural America.\nBut two years later, none of that equipment has been removed and rural telecom companies are still waiting for federal reimbursement money. The FCC received applications to remove some 24,000 pieces of Chinese-made communications equipment\u2014but according to a July 15 update from the commission, it is more than $3 billion short of the money it needs to reimburse all eligible companies.\nAbsent more money from Congress, the FCC says it plans to begin reimbursing approved companies for about 40 percent of the costs of removing Huawei equipment. The FCC did not specify a timeframe on when the money will be disbursed.\nIn late 2020, the Justice Department referred its national security concerns about Huawei equipment to the Commerce Department, and provided information on where the equipment was in place in the US, a former senior US law enforcement official told CNN.\nAfter the Biden administration took office in 2021, the Commerce Department then opened its own probe into Huawei to determine if more urgent action was needed to expunge the Chinese technology provider from US telecom networks, the former law enforcement official and a current senior US official said.\nThat probe has proceeded slowly and is ongoing, the current US official said. Among the concerns that national security officials noted was that external communication from the Huawei equipment that occurs when software is updated, for example, could be exploited by the Chinese government.\nDepending on what the Commerce Department finds, US telecom carriers could be forced to quickly remove Huawei equipment or face fines or other penalties.\nReuters first reported the existence of the Commerce Department probe.\n\u201cWe cannot confirm or deny ongoing investigations, but we are committed to securing our information and communications technology and services supply chain. Protecting US persons safety and security against malign information collection is vital to protecting our economy and national security,\u201d a Commerce Department spokesperson said.\nUS counterintelligence officials have recently made a priority of publicizing threats from China. This month, the US National Counterintelligence and Security Center issued a warning to American businesses and local and state governments about what it says are disguised efforts by China to manipulate them to influence US policy.\nFBI Director Christopher Wray just traveled to London for a joint meeting with top British law enforcement officials to call attention to the Chinese threats.\nIn an exclusive interview with CNN, Wray said the FBI opens a new China counterintelligence investigation every 12 hours. \u201cThat\u2019s probably about 2,000 or so investigations,\u201d said Wray. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not even talking about their cyber theft, where they have a bigger hacking program than that of every other major nation combined, and have stolen more of Americans\u2019 personal and corporate data than every nation combined.\u201d\nAsked why after years of national security concerns raised over Huawei, the equipment is still largely in place atop cell towers near US military bases, Wray said that, \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about allowing any company that is beholden to a nation state that doesn\u2019t adhere to and share our values, giving that company the ability to burrow into our telecommunications infrastructure.\u201d\nHe noted that in 2020, the DOJ indicted Huawei with racketeering conspiracy and conspiracy to steal trade secrets.\n\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s probably about all I can say on the topic,\u201d said Wray.\nCritics see xenophobic overreach\nDespite its tough talk, the US government\u2019s refusal to provide evidence to back up its claims that Huawei tech poses a risk to US national security has led some critics to accuse it of xenophobic overreach. The lack of a smoking gun also raises questions of whether US officials can separate legitimate Chinese investment from espionage.\n\u201cAll of our products imported to the US have been tested and certified by the FCC before being deployed there,\u201d Huawei said in its statement to CNN. \u201cOur equipment only operates on the spectrum allocated by the FCC for commercial use. This means it cannot access any spectrum allocated to the DOD.\u201d\n\u201cFor more than 30 years, Huawei has maintained a proven track record in cyber security and we have never been involved in any malicious cyber security incidents,\u201d the statement said.\nIn its zeal to sniff out evidence of Chinese spying, critics argue the feds have cast too wide a net \u2014 in particular as it relates to academic institutions. In one recent high-profile case, a federal judge acquitted a former University of Tennessee engineering professor whom the Justice Department had prosecuted under its so-called China Initiative that targets Chinese spying, arguing \u201cthere was no evidence presented that [the professor] ever collaborated with a Chinese university in conducting NASA-funded research.\u201d\nAnd on Jan. 20, the Justice Department dropped a separate case against an MIT professor accused of hiding his ties to China, saying it could no longer prove its case. In February, the Biden administration shut down the China Initiative entirely.\nThe federal government\u2019s reticence across multiple administrations to detail what it knows has led some critics to accuse the government of chasing ghosts.\n\u201cIt really comes down to: do you treat China as a neutral actor \u2014 because if you treat China as a neutral actor, then yeah, this seems crazy, that there\u2019s some plot behind every tree,\u201d said Anna Puglisi, a senior fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. \u201cHowever, China has shown us through its policies and actions it is not a neutral actor.\u201d\nChinese tech in the American heartland\nAs early as the Obama administration, FBI agents were monitoring a disturbing pattern along stretches of Interstate 25 in Colorado and Montana, and on arteries into Nebraska. The heavily trafficked corridor connects some of the most secretive military installations in the US, including an archipelago of nuclear missile silos.\nFor years, small, rural telecom providers had been installing cheaper, Chinese-made routers and other technology atop cell towers up and down I-25 and elsewhere in the region. Across much of these sparsely populated swaths of the west, these smaller carriers are the only option for cell coverage. And many of them turned to Huawei for cheaper, reliable equipment.\nBeginning in late 2011, Viaero, the largest regional provider in the area, inked a contract with Huawei to provide the equipment for its upgrade to 3G. A decade later, it has Huawei tech installed across its entire fleet of towers, roughly 1,000 spread over five western states.\nAs Huawei equipment began to proliferate near US military bases, federal investigators started taking notice, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Of particular concern was that Huawei was routinely selling cheap equipment to rural providers in cases that appeared to be unprofitable for Huawei \u2014 but which placed its equipment near military assets.\nFederal investigators initially began \u201cexamining [Huawei] less from a technical lens and more from a business/financial view,\u201d explained John Lenkart, a former senior FBI agent focused on counterintelligence issues related to China. Officials studied where Huawei sales efforts were most concentrated and looked for deals that \u201cmade no sense from a return-on-investment perspective,\u201d Lenkart said.\n\u201cA lot of [counterintelligence] concerns were uncovered based on\u201d those searches, Lenkart said.\nBy examining the Huawei equipment themselves, FBI investigators determined it could recognize and disrupt DOD-spectrum communications \u2014 even though it had been certified by the FCC, according to a source familiar with the investigation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not technically hard to make a device that complies with the FCC that listens to nonpublic bands but then is quietly waiting for some activation trigger to listen to other bands,\u201d said Eduardo Rojas, who leads the radio spectrum lab at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida. \u201cTechnically, it\u2019s feasible.\u201d\nTo prove a device had clandestine capabilities, Rojas said, would require technical experts to strip down a device \u201cto the semi-conductor level\u201d and \u201creverse engineer the design.\u201d But, he said, it can be done.\nAnd there was another big concern along I-25, sources familiar with the investigation said.\nWeather camera worries\nAround 2014, Viaero started mounting high-definition surveillance cameras on its towers to live-stream weather and traffic, a public service it shared with local news organizations. With dozens of cameras posted up and down I-25, the cameras provided a 24-7 bird\u2019s eye view of traffic and incoming weather, even providing advance warning of tornadoes.\nBut they were also inadvertently capturing the movement of US military equipment and personnel, giving Beijing \u2014 or anyone for that matter \u2014 the ability to track the pattern of activity between a series of closely guarded military facilities.\nThe intelligence community determined the publicly posted live-streams were being viewed and likely captured from China, according to three sources familiar with the matter. Two sources briefed on the investigation at the time said officials believed that it was possible for Beijing\u2019s intelligence service to \u201ctask\u201d the cameras \u2014 hack into the network and control where they pointed. At least some of the cameras in question were running on Huawei networks.\nViaero CEO Frank DiRico said it never occurred to him the cameras could be a national security risk.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of missile silos in areas we cover. There is some military presence,\u201d DiRico said in an interview from his Colorado office. But, he said, \u201cI was never told to remove the equipment or to make any changes.\u201d\nIn fact, DiRico first learned of government concerns about Huawei equipment from newspaper articles \u2014 not the FBI \u2014 and says he has never been briefed on the matter.\nDiRico doesn\u2019t question the government\u2019s insistence that he needs to remove Huawei equipment, but he is skeptical that China\u2019s intelligence services can exploit either the Huawei hardware itself or the camera equipment.\n\u201cWe monitor our network pretty good,\u201d DiRico said, adding that Viaero took over the support and maintenance for its own networks from Huawei shortly after installation. \u201cWe feel we\u2019ve got a pretty good idea if there\u2019s anything going on that\u2019s inappropriate.\u201d\nScouring the country for Chinese investments\nBy the time the I-25 investigation was briefed to the White House in 2019, counterintelligence officials begin looking for other places Chinese companies might be buying land or offering to develop a piece of municipal property, like a park or an old factory, sometimes as part of a \u201csister city\u201d arrangement.\nIn one instance, officials shut down what they believed was a risky commercial deal near highly sensitive military testing installations in Utah sometime after the beginning of the I-25 investigation, according to one former US official. The military has a test and training range for hypersonic weapons in Utah, among other things. Sources declined to provide more details.\nFederal officials were also alarmed by what sources described as a host of espionage and influence activities in Houston and, in 2020, shut down the Chinese consulate there.\nBill Evanina, who until early last year ran the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, told CNN that it can sometimes be hard to differentiate between a legitimate business opportunity and espionage \u2014 in part because both might be happening at the same time.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is legitimate companies that are three times removed from Beijing buy [a given] facility for obvious logical reasons, unaware of what the [Chinese] intelligence apparatus wants in that parcel [of land],\u201d Evanina said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen recently \u2014 it\u2019s been what\u2019s underneath the land.\u201d\n\u201cThe hard part is, that\u2019s legitimate business, and what city or town is not going to want to take that money for that land when it\u2019s just sitting there doing nothing?\u201d he added.\nA complicated problem\nAfter the results of the I-25 investigation were briefed to the Trump White House in 2019, the FCC ordered that telecom companies who receive federal subsidies to provide cell service to remote areas \u2014 companies like Viaero \u2014 must \u201crip and replace\u201d their Huawei and ZTE equipment.\nThe FCC has since said that the cost could be more than double the $1.9 billion appropriated in 2020 and absent an additional appropriation from Congress, the agency is only planning to reimburse companies for a fraction of their costs.\nGiven the staggering strategic risk, Lenkart said, \u201crip and replace is a very blunt and inefficient remediation.\u201d\nDiRico, the CEO of Viaero, said the cost of \u201crip and replace\u201d is astronomical and that he doesn\u2019t expect the reimbursement money to be enough to pay for the change. According to the FCC, Viaero is expected to receive less than half of the funding it is actually due. Still, he expects to start removing the equipment within the next year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult and it\u2019s a lot of money,\u201d DiRico said.\nSome former counterintelligence officials expressed frustration that the US government isn\u2019t providing more granular detail about what it knows to companies \u2014 or to cities and states considering a Chinese investment proposal. They believe that not only would that kind of detail help private industry and state and local governments understand the seriousness of the threat as they see it, but also help combat the criticism that the US government is targeting Chinese companies and people, rather than Chinese state-run espionage.\n\u201cThis government has to do a better job of letting everyone know this is a Communist Party issue, it\u2019s not a Chinese people issue,\u201d Evanina said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll be the first to say that the government has to do better with respect to understanding the Communist Party\u2019s intentions are not the same intentions of the Chinese people.\u201d\nA current FBI official said the bureau is giving more defensive briefings to US businesses, academic institutions and state and local governments that include far more detail than in the past, but officials are still fighting an uphill battle.\n\u201cSometimes I feel like we\u2019re a lifeguard going out to a drowning person, and they don\u2019t want our help,\u201d said the current FBI official. But, this person said, \u201cI think sometimes we [the FBI] say \u2018China threat,\u2019 and we take for granted what all that means in our head. And it means something else to the people that we\u2019re delivering it to.\u201d\n\u201cI think we just need to be more careful about how we speak about it and educate folks on why we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing.\u201d\nIn the meantime, the \u201crip and replace\u201d program has remained fiercely controversial.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be easy,\u201d DiRico said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be up nights worrying about it, but we\u2019ll do what we\u2019re told to do.\u201d\nThis story has been updated to reference Wall Street Journal reporting.\nCNN\u2019s Sean Lyngaas contributed to this report."

Alford criticized members of the Trump administration while speaking at the event, which was sponsored by the likes of Google and Facebook.\nAlford added that although he was dismissed for insubordination, he now hangs his termination letter in his office at Notre Dame Law School as a point of pride.\nAlford told the Daily Caller that \u201cWhen the Department of Justice sued to block the HPE/Juniper merger in January 2025 prior to my arrival to the DOJ, Acting AAG Omeed Assefi, in consultation with senior leadership at the Department of Justice, found no evidence of national security concerns sufficient to justify allowing the merger to proceed. The forthcoming Tunney Act proceedings will address whether national security arguments were a proper basis for the DOJ to settle the HPE/Juniper merger.\u201d\nThe DOJ responded to Alford\u2019s allegations, telling the Wall Street Journal that \u201cRoger Alford is the James Comey of antitrust\u2014pursuing blind self-promotion and ego, while ignoring reality.\u201d\nWhile some may tout Alford as a whistleblower standing up against corruption, records obtained by the Daily Caller show that Alford had spent nearly a decade criticizing Trump\u2019s economic policies while being friendly with China, the country that officials believed was a sufficient national security threat to warrant the merger that Alford had opposed.\nIn a 2016 speech at Renmin University in Beijing, China, Alford criticized Trump\u2019s idea for a trade war with China as \u201cludicrous and uninformed,\u201d according to a summary published in the journal Frontiers of Law in China.\nIn his address, Alford said that his \u201cmain concern\u201d for the presidential election was Trump\u2019s plan for an unprecedented ending of a free trade policy with China, according to the summary.\nThe summary said that Alford compared the then Republican presidential nominee with Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, adding that \u201cTrump fundamentally distrusts basic tenets of free trade.\u201d\nWH Press Sec was asked about Roger Alford and DOJ corruption today. \u201cI have no idea who that individual is, I don\u2019t know why he made those comments, I don\u2019t know what basis he\u2019s making those comments on.

A core reason for negotiating the agreement on procedural fairness signed by seventy countries was to address Chinese due process violations. I also led the Antitrust Division\u2019s challenge of China\u2019s antitrust violations, including the unanimous Supreme Court case of Animal Science Products v. Hebei, 585 U.S. __ (2018). In the second Trump Administration I have led efforts to investigate and challenge China\u2019s antitrust violations,\u201d Alford told the Daily Caller.\nAlford continued by restating his commitment to the US and by emphasizing his \u201cgrave concerns about China as a national security threat.\u201d\n\u201cIn a forthcoming article in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy I express strong support for United States\u2019 export control laws and other measures to address intense concern that China\u2019s development of generative AI poses a natural security threat to the United States. In 2024-2025 I served on the Board of the American Security Foundation, a nonprofit, public education organization established to protect America\u2019s technological leadership and to inform the public about emerging threats from China to our national security,\u201d Alford said."

      "text": "The Justice Department has fired two senior antitrust attorneys who disagreed with the handling of a merger between two powerhouse companies, two sources told CNN.\nThe Monday firings came after weeks of tension between the officials, Roger Alford and Bill Rinner, and Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater, who runs the antitrust division. That division is tasked with investigating and suing companies for anticompetitive behavior.\nAlford and Rinner had been put on administrative leave last week due to internal turmoil over how to handle a lawsuit against Hewlett Packard Enterprise for its proposed merger with Juniper Networks, a main competitor, a source said. The DOJ is in discussions to settle its challenge.\nTheir dismissals are part of a continuing battle inside the Justice Department between career officials and political appointees. Hundreds of career employees have left the DOJ \u2013 some of whom have publicly bashed the political employees \u2013 and dozens of others have been fired by department leadership.\nA DOJ official confirmed the firings, citing \u201cinsubordination.\u201d\nCNN has reached out to Alford and Rinner for comment. CBS News was first to report the dismissals.\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche appeared to reference disagreements within the division in mid-July, writing in a social media post that \u201cAnonymous efforts to divide this DOJ will not succeed,\u201d pledging his support for Slater.\nHewlett Packard Enterprise, a spin-off of the old HP, announced its merger with Juniper Networks in January 2024. The tie-up was worth $14 billion at the time and combined HPE\u2019s cloud and networking services offering with Juniper\u2019s artificial intelligence and machine learning businesses. Juniper also sells networking equipment and solutions, but its AI business has become a hot commodity as HPE\u2019s rivals like IBM and Oracle pass it by on the promising new technology.\nA year after the deal was announced, the Trump Justice Department sued to block the merger. It was concerned that the acquisition would combine the No. 2 and No. 3 wireless networking companies, taking a key competitor out of the market (Cisco is the market leader).\n\u201cThis proposed merger would significantly reduce competition and weaken innovation, resulting in large segments of the American economy paying more for less from wireless technology providers,\u201d said Omeed Assefi, the acting antitrust division head of the Justice Department, at the time.\nAt the time, the companies in a statement said the DOJ\u2019s lawsuit was \u201cfundamentally flawed.\u201d\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated when the Justice Department sued to block the merger. It was in January 2025."

In the article, classmates of Romney at the prestigious Cranbrook School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, recall Romney perpetually teasing a classmate perceived to be gay, at one point yelling to the long-haired classmate, \u201cHe can\u2019t look like that. That\u2019s wrong. Just look at him!\u201d Eventually the verbal harassment turned into physical violence, when Romney led a group of students who tackled him, pinned him to the ground, and cut his hair with a pair of scissors, all because Romney didn\u2019t like the way he looked.\nAccording to the article, Mitt Romney claims to have no recollection of the physical altercation, or of bullying the student. However, five of his classmates gave their accounts of the incident to the Washington Post and all have similar recollections of what transpired. One of the students, recalling the victim being terrified, later apologized to him and said, \u201cWhat a senseless, stupid, idiotic thing to do.\u201d In an interview after the article was published, Romney recalled his youth saying, \u201cBack in high school I did some dumb things.\u201d\nJudy Shepard, whose son Matthew was murdered in an anti-gay hate crime in 1998 said: \u201cWhile this may seem like an innocent prank to some, it was an act of torment against a child for being different. We expect the people we elect to be leaders in the charge against bullying so that all students are afforded the right to learn and grow in an environment free of fear. This incident calls into question whether Mitt Romney can be an advocate for the nation\u2019s most vulnerable children.\u201d\n\u201cWe cannot look past this incident now that Romney is the presumptive Republican nominee for president,\u201d said HRC President Joe Solmonese. \u201cMitt Romney\u2019s unwillingness to understand or acknowledge the gravity of his actions and sincerely apologize is a troubling suggestion of a lack of character.\u201d is a troubling suggestion of a lack of character.\u201d\nWith Mitt Romney\u2019s anti-gay past exposed, it is clear why he has flip flopped on the issue of LGBT rights, becoming a vehemently anti-equality candidate in the race for the presidency. Yesterday as President Obama demonstrated clear leadership in expressing his support for marriage equality, Romney told a Denver news station: \"If a civil union is identical to marriage other than in the name, I don't support that.\u201d\n\u201cMitt Romney has come full-circle in his views on LGBT equality. He has gone from being a bully perpetuating violence on a classmate who was different from him, to a candidate who in 1994 said he would be better to the LGBT community than Ted Kennedy, to a candidate in 2012 whose views are in line with the most fringe anti-LGBT groups,\u201d added Solmonese.\nLearn more about Romney\u2019s disastrous track record on issues of LGBT equality at hrc.org/mittnmatch.\nThe Human Rights Campaign is America's largest civil rights organization working to achieve lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality.

      "text": "A former Trump Justice Department appointee blasted some of his ex-colleagues in a speech Monday, saying they \u201cperverted justice and acted inconsistent with the rule of law\u201d \u2014 and he named names.\nWant your company\u2019s merger approved? Pay a MAGA influencer.\nA former Trump appointee alleges the DOJ is letting firms buy exemptions from anti-monopoly laws.\nRoger Alford was a top appointee in the DOJ\u2019s antitrust division in both President Donald Trump\u2019s first and second terms. He and his boss, DOJ antitrust division chief Gail Slater, are associated with a faction on the right that wants tougher antitrust enforcement. They take a more skeptical view of mergers in sectors where only a few major companies are competing.\nBut Alford was fired last month. And now, he\u2019s gone public about what happened, outlining what he said amounted to a \u201cpay-to-play\u201d scandal, where companies paid well-connected outside MAGA influencers to try to get mergers approved, and certain top DOJ officials played ball.\n\u201cFor 30 pieces of silver, MAGA-in-Name-Only lobbyists are influencing their allies within the DOJ and risking President Trump\u2019s populist conservative agenda,\u201d Alford said. \u201cTheir goal is to line their own pockets by working for any corporation that will pay top dollar to settle antitrust cases on the cheap.\u201d\n\u201cPerverted justice and acted inconsistent with the rule of law\u201d\nThough Alford didn\u2019t have anything negative to say about Trump or Attorney General Pam Bondi, he pointed the finger at two officials in particular: Bondi\u2019s chief of staff, Chad Mizelle, and Associate Attorney General nominee Stan Woodward.\nMizelle \u201cmakes key decisions depending on whether the request or information comes from a MAGA friend,\u201d Alford said. He continued: \u201cAware of this injustice, companies are hiring lawyers and influence peddlers to bolster their MAGA credentials and pervert traditional law enforcement.\u201d\nThe background to this is that back in January, shortly after Trump was sworn in, the DOJ\u2019s antitrust team sued to block IT company Hewlett Packard Enterprise from buying a rival, Juniper Networks.\nBut in June, DOJ suddenly backed off, agreeing to a settlement that let the deal proceed with minor concessions.\nThis, Alford clearly believes, was because Hewlett Packard hired two outside MAGA figures to grease the wheels for them: Mike Davis (a conservative legal activist) and Arthur Schwartz (a longtime ally of Donald Trump Jr.).\n\u201cMike Davis and Arthur Schwartz have made a Faustian bargain of trading on relationships with powerful people to reportedly earn million-dollar success fees by helping corporations undermine Trump\u2019s antitrust agenda, hurt working class Americans, break the rules, and then try to cover it up,\u201d Alford said in his speech.\nAlford didn\u2019t go into all the details about what happened, but Semafor has reported that Mizelle overruled Slater and Alford to push through the Hewlett Packard settlement \u2014 and Alford was fired soon afterward. (The drama spilled out into public, and even Laura Loomer got involved, as the antimonopoly advocate Matt Stoller has chronicled.)\nUrging a judge reviewing the merger to dig into the matter more, Alford\u2019s speech continued: \u201cIt is my opinion that in the HPE/Juniper merger scandal, Chad Mizelle, and Stanley Woodward perverted justice and acted inconsistent with the rule of law. I am not given to hyperbole, and I do not say that lightly.\u201d\nA DOJ spokesperson pushed back in a statement: \u201cRoger Alford is the James Comey of antitrust \u2014 pursuing blind self-promotion and ego, while ignoring reality. He was fired from the Department, and all should treat his comments for what they are \u2014 the delusional musings of a disgruntled ex.\u201d\nWhat this is really all about\nOver the past decade, a new antitrust movement skeptical of Big Tech and big corporations generally has gained some traction on both the left and right. Joe Biden\u2019s FTC chair, Lina Khan, became the face of this movement for Democrats, and certain up-and-coming Republicans seeking a populist brand, such as JD Vance, professed admiration for her.\nMost Republicans, though, loathed Khan, sympathizing with complaints from business leaders that she was overly scrutinizing mergers, and took the GOP\u2019s traditional pro-corporate line.\nWhen Trump won his second term, though, he nominated a Vance staffer, Gail Slater, as his DOJ antitrust chief. Antitrust reformers like Stoller liked Slater and took her appointment as an encouraging sign that \u201cTrump wants to take on big tech.\u201d\nIn practice, though, Trump\u2019s administration has been most defined by its weaponization of government for shakedown tactics. Trump likes deals, and he likes getting companies (or universities) to cough up money. He likes it when people ask him for favors, and he likes asking for things from them in return. He was never truly committed to an ideological agenda of tough antitrust enforcement. And he\u2019s fine with Big Tech, so long as Big Tech gives him what he wants.\nSlater and Alford apparently didn\u2019t get the memo and thought they\u2019d have a free hand to enforce the law as they felt appropriate. But this earned them enemies inside and outside the administration, CBS News reported last month. There were deals to be had \u2014 and money to be made.\nIn his speech, Alford referred to \u201cpeople inside and outside government\u201d who \u201cconsider law enforcement not as binding rules but an opportunity to leverage power and extract concessions.\u201d\nBut though Alford put the blame on those two DOJ officials, his description seems to fit Trump\u2019s approach to governance quite well.\nWe don\u2019t know whether Trump himself got involved in the Hewlett Packard matter. But, as the saying goes, the Cossacks work for the Czar."

      "text": "Last month, when the Washington Post ran a dual profile of Donald Trump and Robert Mueller, the paper took care to note Mueller\u2019s daily wardrobe when he was the director of the F.B.I.: \u201ca traditional J. Edgar Hoover-era G-man uniform: dark suit, red or blue tie and white shirt\u2014always white.\u201d A consideration of Mueller\u2019s clothes has become a commonplace of both written narratives and TV chitchat about him. In the absence of leaks from the special counsel\u2019s office, the public is left to listen to the clothes, which are equally reticent, which is their elegance. Assembled from a narrow palette of Establishment standards, Mueller\u2019s regular outfit communicates a moral outlook in its particulars, an unostentatious grace in its polish. One of the pleasanter aberrations of the Trump era is the emergence of Robert Swan Mueller III, the owner of a modest rotation of discreetly striped Brooks Brothers suits, as a fashion icon.\nLast year, Derek Guy, of the menswear blog Die, Workwear!, wrote an admiring post about Mueller, titled \u201cThe Trad in Washington.\u201d Guy argued that the special counsel soberly propounds traditional values by way of \u201csoft shouldered suits with naturally rounded sleeveheads.\u201d \u201cMueller is one of the only people in Washington who knows how to wear a coat-and-tie,\u201d Guy wrote. \u201cAll the details are middle-of-the-road, but they\u2019re so perfectly executed that they come together in a classic American way you rarely see anymore.\u201d Mueller\u2019s strong tendency toward foulard ties, with their navy or burgundy fields graced by suave geometries of small patterns, demonstrates a refinement that is nicely balanced by his wristwatch, with its horsey hexagonal chunk of a black plastic case. Identified by amateur horologists as a Casio DW-290 sport watch, with a list price of fifty dollars, it is synched to project an incorruptible constancy.\nThe Casio complements the shirts on a spiritual level. \u201cHe is so straight, he always wears a white shirt,\u201d Thomas B. Wilner, a longtime friend of Mueller\u2019s, told the Post. \u201cHe\u2019s conscious that he\u2019s a public figure, and he doesn\u2019t want anything to compromise his integrity. Even a blue shirt.\u201d\nThe white shirt is a symbol of purity, yes, but it also sends security-blanket signals. Garrett M. Graff, the author of \u201cThe Threat Matrix: Inside Robert Mueller\u2019s FBI and the War on Global Terror,\u201d is the foremost scholar of Mueller\u2019s taste in dress shirts. \u201cI once asked him: Why the cult of the white shirt?,\u201d Graff wrote in Politico, last year. \u201cHe answered more philosophically than I\u2019d ever seen him speak before.\u201d Mueller offered the rationale that, amid the Bureau\u2019s shift toward counterterrorism, \u201che felt it important to keep recognizable totems of the past in place\u2014like the tradition of the white shirt\u2014to help agents understand it was still the same FBI they\u2019d signed up to join.\u201d Elsewhere, Graff has relayed a vision of Mueller mocking subordinates in staff meetings who deviated from his color scheme, reporting that \u201ccolored shirts are worn at one\u2019s own peril.\u201d\nThe button-down collars of Mueller\u2019s shirts\u2014so soft and nonchalant when compared with the spread collars underlining the smirk of Jared Kushner\u2014are the mark of an unreconstructed preppy. A fellow needn\u2019t have developed his sartorial manners at fancy schools to earn distinction as a prep dresser, but it happens that Mueller did, graduating from St. Paul\u2019s School, in 1962, and from Princeton, in 1966\u2014during the heyday of the Ivy League Look. Under the ascent of this style, with its compromise of poise and ease, all sorts of mid-century men educated themselves in the virtues of flannel trousers, madras jackets, and cordovan penny loafers. Mueller learned a way of looking smart without seeming excessively smooth.\nWithin the community of men passionate about preppy clothing, there\u2019s a lively conversation around Mueller\u2019s preference for starch in his oxford-cloth shirt, a choice evident in the unusual curvature of the roll of his collar, which bulges where you\u2019d expect it to arc gently. It takes a certain sort of prep to starch his oxford cloth. There is a school of thought that holds that this material looks appealing when wrinkled and creased, and Mueller pointedly does not attend it. In his emphasis on telegraphing rectitude, it is tempting to see the influence of Mueller\u2019s tenure in the Marines. The military influence on Mueller\u2019s dress sense is further apparent in his habit of wearing his hideous Casio turned so that the face is on the inside of his wrist, the way an infantryman would, and perhaps even in his inclination toward tailoring that is, by the boxy terms of Washington cuts, relatively trim.\nThis is a costume for an allegory. On the one hand, you have Trump\u2019s onetime campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who, according to Mueller\u2019s indictment, spent more than $1.3 million on clothes in the course of about six years, including peak-lapel suits of baronial slickness. On the other hand, you have a government lawyer with an ideally understated public image. An understatement is a statement nonetheless, and Mueller\u2019s sartorial rhetoric encodes heroic values. He is armored in the good, clean, honest look of an extremely civil servant, unaffected and, therefore, inimitable."

He\u2019s a no-doubt conservative who served in both Trump administrations, yet he is cursed with having a sense of right and wrong. He was fired a few weeks ago for resisting pay-to-play corruption at the Justice Department, which offended his belief system. Unlike virtually everyone in the Republican Party since Inauguration Day, he\u2019s willing to talk about it.\nAlford, now a law professor at Notre Dame, delivered a speech at the Tech Policy Institute Aspen Forum on Monday, and simultaneously released an opinion piece in UnHerd, a well-known forum for populist conservatives. In both, he decried the subordination of the rule of law to a \u201crule of lobbyists,\u201d confirming a degradation of antitrust under Trump that has been widely reported. In doing so, he made it more likely that the lobbyist cabal and their enablers in the Justice Department, both of whom he singled out by name, would face a judicial tribunal that can expose this broken process.\nHere are the top takeaways from Alford\u2019s revelations on Monday, and what it means for those in power and the future of antitrust enforcement:\nPlaying on betrayal. Some progressives may blanche at Alford\u2019s praise for President Trump\u2019s populist messaging, and insistence that it has been subverted by top DOJ officials selling out to lobbyists. He absolves Attorney General Pam Bondi and her number two Todd Blanche of blame as well.\nSetting up a dichotomy between \u201cgenuine MAGA reformers and MAGA-In-Name-Only lobbyists\u201d may not sit well. But the audience for these remarks is not anyone reading the Prospect. He is attempting to reach the president and his inner circle by playing on Trump\u2019s demand for total loyalty.\nAlford personally names Bondi\u2019s chief of staff Chad Mizelle and associate attorney general nominee Stanley Woodward as betraying the MAGA realignment of working-class voters by selling merger clearance to the highest bidder, concerns that he says are \u201cnot based on conjecture.\u201d Mizelle and Woodward, Alford states, don\u2019t share Bondi\u2019s \u201ccommitment to a single tier of justice for all,\u201d instead welcoming MAGA influencer lobbyists like Mike Davis, Arthur Schwartz, and Will Levi into boozy backroom deals for their clients. Specifically, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Juniper Networks paid Davis and Schwartz and Levi $1 million to defuse a merger challenge, and Mizelle and Woodward, perceiving them as MAGA comrades, overruled Antitrust Division chief Gail Slater to settle the case. Alford and Bill Rinner, who was also fired recently, were involved in the HPE negotiations.\nWhether you believe Trump and Bondi actually have the best interests of the common man at heart or not (I vociferously don\u2019t), in the context of Alford trying to build a wedge against those figures he sees as corrupt, it\u2019s probably the best rhetorical play he can make.\nI should add that the Justice Department is playing the loyalty angle as well: A spokesperson told The Wall Street Journal that Alford is \u201cthe James Comey of antitrust.\u201d\nTunney Act witness. Alford pointedly refers to the \u201cHPE-Juniper merger scandal,\u201d and urges that Judge Casey Pitts, who is overseeing the case, use the Tunney Act, a 1974 law written to prevent antitrust enforcement from becoming corrupted by big money, to intervene in the settlement. \u201cI hope the court blocks the HPE-Juniper merger. If you knew what I knew, you would hope so too,\u201d Alford said.\nBut what\u2019s important is the line that comes after: \u201cSomeday I may have the opportunity to say more.\u201d While Alford was circumspect on the details in his speech, that line was a tell that Alford would be willing to say what he knows if compelled under oath.\nIf Judge Pitts initiates a Tunney Act proceeding in the HPE-Juniper case, he can, as Alford notes, \u201cdemand extensive discovery and examine the surprising truth of what happened.\u201d That includes documents and witnesses. As Alford concedes, the Tunney Act has not really worked as intended; weakening by the D.C. Circuit Court is a primary cause of that. But this time, you have a top Justice Department official pointing to two other top officials who distorted the legal system. Judge Pitts has an obligation to the public interest to examine that, and a key witness who could give him the necessary information.\nSelf-enrichment. Davis and Schwartz and Levi have a financial interest in pay-to-play perversion of the justice system. Alford specifically cites \u201cmillion-dollar success fees\u201d for their service to corporations. But this can only be perpetuated with friends on the inside.\n\u201cIn my opinion based on regular meetings with him, Chad Mizelle accepts party meetings and makes key decisions depending on whether the request or information comes from a MAGA friend,\u201d Alford claims. That\u2019s a significant charge of corruption. And it leads other companies to learn how the game is played and hire their own lawyers and lobbyists with the home-team MAGA imprimatur to get what they want. From an economic standpoint, anyone seen as a \u201cMAGA friend\u201d can boost their asking price to deliver results for corporations. And Alford notes that ethical lawyers cannot compete with unethical ones, sending them out the door and poisoning the entire system.\nMizelle has his own interest in this. Davis, beyond soliciting favorable treatment for companies, helps conservative judges get federal appointments. Mizelle\u2019s wife Kathryn received one of those appointments, as a district court judge in the Middle District of Florida in 2020. It has been reported that Kathryn Mizelle wants to bump up to the circuit court of appeals, and Davis is well positioned to advise Trump to make that happen. In this way, Mizelle helping Davis get his way for his clients could pay off.\nPeople like Mizelle, Alford says, \u201cconsider law enforcement not as binding rules but an opportunity to leverage power and extract concessions. They have, shall we say, a loose relationship with the law.\u201d\nA warning on Live Nation. Alford describes a \u201cnew normal\u201d where firms hire influence-peddlers to go above the heads of antitrust enforcers, \u201cseeking special favors with warm hugs.\u201d And he pointedly asks which case will be next, and not in a hypothetical way. \u201cWill the same senior DOJ officials ignore the President\u2019s Executive Order just because Live Nation and Ticketmaster have paid a bevy of cozy MAGA friends to roam the halls of the Fifth Floor in defense of their monopoly abuses?\u201d\nThe executive order being referred to involves \u201ccombating unfair practices in the live entertainment market.\u201d Trump cites ticket scalpers and bots as the main problem here, urging enforcers to target them. In fact, just yesterday, the Federal Trade Commission sued ticket resellers for securing thousands of tickets to live events and jacking up the price on the resale market.\nBut this ignores the root cause of Live Nation using its market power in promotion, venues, and ticketing to charge outrageous fees, shortchange fans and artists, and subvert competition. The Justice Department Antitrust Division has an active lawsuit over this illegal monopolization. And Alford is saying here that Live Nation has hired lobbyists\u2014Mike Davis is reportedly one of them\u2014to get the case dropped.\nMaking business harder. Alford uses a lot of biblical, moral rhetoric in the speech. But he also has a practical point. Rule by lobbyists is inherently unstable, he says, which actually creates more hazardous terrain for mergers. \u201cI personally have heard lawyers say that the political uncertainty of this Administration is more difficult than the predictable but hostile environment of the Biden Administration,\u201d he says.\nI\u2019ve heard that said before. If a business has to not only worry about whether their merger is legal but whether they can locate the right fixer to bless whatever they\u2019re doing, regardless of the law, the system becomes harder, not easier, to navigate. It\u2019s not like the Trump administration will decline to harass companies if they follow the law; there\u2019s apparently a \u201cloyalty list\u201d in the White House for companies that are perceived friends or enemies. Alford is right to say that this creates \u201cmassive legal and economic uncertainty.\u201d\nSeeking change. Alford isn\u2019t out for glory here; he truly thinks that the Justice Department can course-correct and stop giving out preferential treatment in a sale to the wealthy. I don\u2019t really agree with him, but that appears to be his motivation. He has friends back in the Antitrust Division, and he wants them to be able to do their work without interference.\n\u201cI am speaking out now because it is still early days in this Administration and I think correcting the problems at the DOJ is still possible, either by political will or judicial decree,\u201d he says, again implicitly citing the Tunney Act as a tool to fight corruption. One way this could end is that the negative publicity from a messy Tunney Act proceeding forces the pay-to-play system back underground. Alford also suggests that his boss, Slater, should report directly to Blanche, and that Mizelle and Woodward should be removed from antitrust oversight. He hints at the need for \u201cpersonnel changes among the senior leadership at the Department of Justice.\u201d\nPersonally, I think the Antitrust Division has gotten the message that it\u2019s time to back off. There are no pending merger cases at the division for the first time in years. The leftover conduct cases against RealPage, Ticketmaster, Google, and Apple have an unknown future.\nAlford is fighting uphill, though it\u2019s significant that he\u2019s fighting."

      "text": "The telecom equipment market in 2024 saw shifts in revenue share among top vendors, the latest data from Dell\u2019Oro Group showed.\nHuawei has remained the telecom equipment market leader worldwide, increasing its share to 31 percent from 30 percent in 2023.\nNokia followed, though its share declined slightly from 15 percent to 14 percent in telecom equipment market.\nEricsson strengthened its position in telecom equipment market with a marginal increase from 12 percent to 13 percent.\nZTE held its share steady at 11 percent in telecom equipment market.\nOther key players included Cisco, which saw a decline from 6 percent to 4 percent, and Ciena, which maintained a stable presence at 3 percent. Samsung and Juniper each accounted for 2 percent of the market.\nThe \u201cOthers\u201d category, representing various smaller suppliers, saw a notable decline from 19 percent to 20 percent, indicating a slight concentration of market share among leading players.\nOutside of China, Huawei overtook Nokia as the top vendor, while Ericsson remained in a strong position. Cisco experienced a decline, whereas Ciena, Samsung, and ZTE remained relatively stable in their market positions.\nThe telecom equipment market faced significant challenges in 2024, with conditions improving in the second half but failing to offset an overall difficult year for telecom suppliers.\nWorldwide telecom equipment revenues across six key segments \u2014 Broadband Access, Microwave & Optical Transport, Mobile Core Network (MCN), Radio Access Network (RAN), and SP Router & Switch \u2014 declined 11 percent, marking the steepest annual decline in over two decades. The last comparable drop exceeded 20 percent in 2002.\nThis downturn led to a cumulative 14 percent decline over the past two years, reflecting broad-based deceleration across telecom sectors. Multiple factors, including excess inventory, macroeconomic challenges, and difficult comparisons with previous 5G expansion periods, contributed to the decline.\nFourth-quarter stabilization was primarily driven by growth in North America and EMEA, nearly counteracting weaker demand in the Asia-Pacific region, including China. However, the annual decline varied across the six telecom segments. Optical Transport, SP Routers, and RAN experienced the sharpest contractions, collectively shrinking by 14 percent in 2024. Meanwhile, Microwave Transport and MCN registered a more moderate decline in the low single digits, and Broadband Access revenues remained relatively stable.\nRegional developments also presented a mixed picture. The slowdown impacted all five major regions \u2014 North America, EMEA, Asia Pacific, China, and CALA \u2014 but was more pronounced in Asia Pacific, where difficult market conditions in both China and the broader Asia-Pacific region contributed to the downturn.\nLooking ahead to 2025, telecom equipment market conditions are expected to stabilize, although challenges will persist. Analysts project that global telecom equipment revenues across the six key segments will remain flat for the year, signaling a pause in the decline but no immediate return to growth.\nBaburajan Kizhakedath"

      "text": "The reporter intended the anecdote that opened part four of the Boston Globe\u2019s profile of Mitt Romney to illustrate, as the story said, \u201cemotion-free crisis management\u201d: Father deals with minor \u2014 but gross \u2014 incident during a 1983 family vacation, and saves the day. But the details of the event are more than unseemly \u2014 they may, in fact, be illegal.\nThe incident: dog excrement found on the roof and windows of the Romney station wagon. How it got there: Romney strapped a dog carrier \u2014 with the family dog Seamus, an Irish Setter, in it \u2014 to the roof of the family station wagon for a twelve hour drive from Boston to Ontario, which the family apparently completed, despite Seamus\u2019s rather visceral protest.\nMassachusetts\u2019s animal cruelty laws specifically prohibit anyone from carrying an animal \u201cin or upon a vehicle, or otherwise, in an unnecessarily cruel or inhuman manner or in a way and manner which might endanger the animal carried thereon.\u201d An officer for the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals responded to a description of the situation saying \u201cit\u2019s definitely something I\u2019d want to check out.\u201d The officer, Nadia Branca, declined to give a definitive opinion on whether Romney broke the law but did note that it\u2019s against state law to have a dog in an open bed of a pick-up truck, and \u201cif the dog was being carried in a way that endangers it, that would be illegal.\u201d And while it appears that the statute of limitations has probably passed, Stacey Wolf, attorney and legislative director for the ASPCA, said \u201ceven if it turns out to not be against the law at the time, in the district, we\u2019d hope that people would use common sense\u2026Any manner of transporting a dog that places the animal in serious danger is something that we\u2019d think is inappropriate\u2026I can\u2019t speak to the accuracy of the case, but it raises concerns about the judgment used in this particular situation.\u201d\nIngrid Newkirk, president of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, was less circumspect. PETA does not have a position on Romney\u2019s candidacy per se, but Newkirk called the incident \u201ca lesson in cruelty that was \u2026 wrong for [his children] to witness\u2026Thinking of the wind, the weather, the speed, the vulnerability, the isolation on the roof, it is commonsense that any dog who\u2019s under extreme stress might show that stress by losing control of his bowels: that alone should have been sufficient indication that the dog was, basically, being tortured.\u201d Romney, of course, has expressed support for the use of \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d techniques when it comes to terrorists; his campaign refused to comment about the treatment of his dog.\nAs organizer of the Salt Lake City Olympic Games, Romney came under fire from some animal welfare groups for including a rodeo exhibition as part of the Games\u2019 festivities. At the time, he told protesters, \u201cWe are working hard to make this as safe a rodeo for cowboys and animals as is humanly possible.\u201d\nMore Must-Reads from TIME\n- Cybersecurity Experts Are Sounding the Alarm on DOGE\n- Meet the 2025 Women of the Year\n- The Harsh Truth About Disability Inclusion\n- Why Do More Young Adults Have Cancer?\n- Colman Domingo Leads With Radical Love\n- How to Get Better at Doing Things Alone\n- Michelle Zauner Stares Down the Darkness\nContact us at letters@time.com"
