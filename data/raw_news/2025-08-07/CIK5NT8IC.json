  "title": "Does In-N-Out Burger\u2019s CEO moving from California to Tennessee hurt the brand?",
  "description": "In-N-Out Burger CEO Lynsi Snyder faced a backlash about moving from California to Tennessee. Economists explain whether the move hurts the brand.",
  "content": "In-N-Out Burger CEO Lynsi Snyder faced a backlash in late July when she announced on a podcast that she was moving to Tennessee, where the brand is building a new office.\n\nThe burger chain has been synonymous with California, and the Western U.S., since its founding in Baldwin Park in 1948. Snyder said on the podcast that it was difficult to raise a family in California, doing business here was hard, and the move would allow workers to buy more affordable homes outside of the expensive Golden State housing market.\n\nBacklash was swift, with many of In-N-Out\u2019s biggest fans pointing out Snyder\u2019s net worth was estimated to be $7.3 billion (according to Forbes) and that she had personally benefited from California. She later took to Instagram to say the company would still be headquartered in California and she appreciated the state\u2019s customers.\n\nBusiness types and opinion writers came to her defense, noting the state\u2019s high income tax and that other big companies have decided to relocate.\n\nQuestion: Does the In-N-Out Burger CEO moving to Tennessee hurt the brand?\n\nNO: People go to In-N-Out for the burgers, not the boardroom biography. If you can still order multiple quality patties from the secret menu, the brand will be just fine. The real eyebrow-raiser here isn\u2019t branding \u2014 it\u2019s California\u2019s business and living costs. Maybe it\u2019s time the Golden State focuses more on reducing delays for zoning permits and such to rival the line at an In-N-Out. Otherwise, we are going to see more businesses moving Out than In.\n\nNO: Numerous major firms leave California because of the state\u2019s oppressive regulations, taxes and operating costs. Since 2018, 275 headquarters relocated from the state, worth more than $550 billion, according to Business Insider. The CEO and other execs moving is likely the first step in later relocating headquarter operations. Moving is a highly disruptive action taken to preserve and prosper a business that would otherwise prefer not doing. In-N-Out\u2019s relocation further reflects the dimming of Southern California\u2019s fading lifestyle image.\n\nNO: The brand name that should be hurt by CEO Lynsi Snyder\u2019s move is the state of California, not In-N-Out Burger. California has the highest tax rates in the U.S. and near the highest minimum wage. Our government piles regulations on businesses and turns a blind eye as shoplifting ruins retail outlets. The politicians try to blame company greed every time the state loses more of its wealth creators. But I think the blame is in Sacramento.\n\nNO: Most consumers don\u2019t know where CEOs live or where headquarters are, except for some local brands. Amazon Prime members rarely check product origins unless shipping costs are involved. In-N-Out Burger sources meat, buns, and sauces from California and Texas. What more do you want? Lynsi Snyder should not be attacked for making claims about the relative costs of living or regulatory burdens employers face here that most of us know are true.\n\nNO: The backlash from the poorly chosen comments may cause some customers to shift to rivals, but In-N-Out can engage in damage control and repair the brand by emphasizing a continuing commitment to its California customers. The company is not alone in having a CEO make negative statements about California or to move operations and staff to another state. Moreover, some customers may agree with the CEO\u2019s statements that California is expensive and not business friendly.\n\nNO: In-n-Out\u2019s decision to relocate reflects a practical response to California\u2019s anti\u2011business climate, economic realities and housing unaffordability. The move does not harm the brand. This is just the beginning of the exodus of businesses from California due to high corporate and income taxes, and ridiculous state and local regulations. Furthermore, this move positions In\u2011N\u2011Out for better national growth and improved operational efficiency while providing corporate employees a higher quality of life with lower taxes and housing costs.\n\nYES: One aspect of In-N-Out\u2019s brand is that it is a California institution. Many of its locations have crossed palm trees outside and its packaging features palm trees. It has a cult-like following that spreads through word-of-mouth, and people make a point of visiting the restaurant during trips to California. Moving to Tennessee may help it in terms of expanding nationally, but its uniqueness may be reduced as it becomes more available and competes against McDonald\u2019s and Burger King.\n\nNO: In-N-Out\u2019s popularity is built on high-quality ingredients, a concise menu, limited presence across the country and strong brand values \u2014 not the location of its headquarters or its CEO. The CEO\u2019s move to Tennessee reflects a broader trend of business (and residential) departures from California, which isn\u2019t a business-friendly state because of regulatory and economic challenges. This move is unlikely to harm the brand, which remains beloved for its culture and customer experience.\n\nNO: Not the brand, just California\u2019s pride. Where the CEO and their families live is irrelevant to the quality of the product. It does speak to high state income taxes in California and what the wealthy are doing to avoid them.\n\nNO: This is probably a tax dodge. California has the fifth highest overall tax rate in the U.S., while Tennessee has the 46th lowest. Snyder should enjoy Tennessee\u2019s weather. While she can\u2019t jog outside most of the year, she can well afford an indoor running track. I am confident that this will have zero impact on In-N-Out\u2019s business. My sons will still rate their burgers No. 1 and covet their animal-style fries\n\nNO: Californians see the brand as a cultural icon. The company is opening an \u201ceastern territory\u201d office to support expansion, and In-N-Out has a fiercely loyal customer base. Past controversies, like political donations, sparked brief outrage but didn\u2019t dent sales. Furthermore, Tennessee offers significant tax advantages, including no personal income tax and lower corporate taxes, which could benefit the company financially. We all understand that, as we live in a state that seems anti-business. Let\u2019s change that.\n\nNO: Lynsi Snyder\u2019s relocation won\u2019t dent In-N-Out\u2019s rabid following. Quality, consistency and price drive the brand\u2019s loyalty, and the supply chain remains California-based. The company is already expanding eastward, and backlash over the CEO\u2019s address will fade quickly. In my view, the larger reputational risk lies in reports of increasingly explicit \u201cChristian values\u201d pushed on staff and patrons \u2014 a trend that could eventually alienate customers in diverse markets.\n\nNO: The customers who love In-N-Out will continue to love it. Few will know or care where the company CEO lives. Their CEO is correct that it is more difficult to do business in California compared to many other states due to regulations, high minimum wages \u2014 critical for fast-food restaurants \u2014 and taxes. Other states are trying to attract businesses with incentives, low taxes and fewer regulations. That\u2019s how jobs are created and economies grown.\n\nHave an idea for an Econometer question?

      "text": "\u201cFollow the money\u201d is an age-old adage for reporters and businesses alike. The CEO of the internationally renowned burger joint In-N-Out, however, is taking a different approach \u2013 moving her family from California, where the chain boasts 276 locations, to Tennessee, where it has zero.\nBillionaire heiress and CEO Lynsi Snyder, granddaughter of In-N-Out\u2019s founders, publicly announced the relocation during a family-and-faith-studded conversation on Allie Beth Stuckey\u2019s podcast Relatable. Interview sponsors included an online academy that promises to keep children safe from socialist indoctrination, as well as an anti-abortion diaper company.\nSnyder, with a Forbes-estimated net worth of $7.3bn fueled by the California burger chain, said that she sees greener pastures in the Volunteer state, where she plans to beef up the Franklin, Tennessee, office. The company\u2019s two major California offices, in Irvine and Baldwin Park, will be merged under one roof, with the Irvine office closing by 2030.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of great things about California, but raising a family is not easy here, doing business is not easy here,\u201d Snyder said.\nSnyder also detailed her rise in the company, her journey with Christianity and her past marriages. Faith is prominent not just in Snyder\u2019s personal life, but at In-N-Out as well, with Bible verses printed on soda cups and fry bags.\nWell known for its palm trees and simple menu, the company has exploded past its California roots, with locations in eight states. It currently has 35 locations planned to open in Tennessee. Snyder, however, said that the company has no current intentions for a major east coast expansion.\n\u201cFlorida has begged us and we\u2019re still saying \u2018no\u2019, the east coast states we\u2019re still saying \u2018no\u2019,\u201d Snyder said."

      "text": "In-N-Out exec responds to backlash after announcing her move from California to Tennessee\nLynsi Snyder, president and owner of In-N-Out, is speaking out after social media users criticized her for comments she made about the chain's home state of California.\nSnyder, 43, issued a statement on July 22 after making critical comments about \"The Golden State\" when discussing her family's move to Tennessee, where In-N-Out is also slated to open an eastern office to \"support our growth.\"\n\"I\u2019m very proud of where In-N-Out started,\" Snyder wrote. \"Anyone who knows me knows how often I talk about our beginnings and how our customers here in California helped bring us to where we are today.\"\nThe backlash began shortly after Snyder, who has been in charge of the burger empire since 2010, made complaints about living and doing business in California in a recent interview.\n\"Like you said, there's a lot of great things about California, but raising a family is not easy here,\" Snyder told Allie Beth Stuckey, host of the \"Relatable\" podcast. \"Doing business is not easy here.\"\nSnyder did not elaborate further on the reasons for why for she and a \"handful\" of In-N-Out employees along with their families will head east to Franklin, Tennessee, but told Stuckey that it \"will be wonderful having an office out there, growing out there.\"\nIn-N-Out heiress Lynsi Snyder responds to criticism\nIn response to online flack that Snyder has received since the interview, she posted a three-minute In-N-Out themed montage across her social media accounts to dispel misinterpretations about the company's expansion in Tennessee, and to show love to the company's home state.\nIn the video, Snyder clarified the following points:\n- \"We're not moving In-N-Out's corporate headquarters. In addition to our Baldwin Park office, we're expanding with an Eastern Territory Office in Tennessee to support our growth.\"\n- \"We're not leaving California, or leaving our roots behind. Each one of our locations is here to stay.\"\n- \"Moving into Tennessee provides our In-N-Out Associates wonderful opportunities to buy a home and raise a family and be a part of our expansion in a different part of the U.S.\"\n- \"Where I raise my family has nothing to do with my love and appreciation for our Customers in California.\"\nThe move, Snyder says in her voiceover, is part of a \"healthy plan\" for the company's growth and provides \"so many\" opportunities for people to own homes in Tennessee and the surrounding states they could possibly end up in.\n\"We've been expanding into new states since 1992, and we've stayed consistent with our standards for growth,\" Snyder wrote. \"Opening an office far from our roots is something new and exciting. It brings incredible opportunities for the people we love and the Customers we serve.\"\nSnyder also confirmed in the interview that In-N-Out burger plans to close its offices in Irvine by 2030.\nWho is Lynsi Snyder?\nSnyder, 43, is the president and owner of In-N-Out Burger.\nHer grandparents, Harry and Esther Snyder, opened the first In-N-Out in 1948, starting with a drive-thru burger stand in Baldwin Park, located about 20 miles east of Los Angeles. The chain is now headquartered in Irvine, California with hundreds of locations across the West and Southwest, including Texas, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Nevada, Utah and Idaho.\nLynsi Snyder became the company's president in 2010.\nHer net worth is an estimated $7.3 billion as of July 23, according to Forbes.\nContributing: James Powel, USA TODAY"
