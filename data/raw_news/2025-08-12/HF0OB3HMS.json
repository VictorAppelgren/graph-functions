  "content": "Vikings receiver Rondale Moore suffered a season-ending knee injury Saturday and will miss his second straight NFL season due to an August injury.\n\nMoore, the 25-year-old former second-round pick out of Purdue in 2021, sustained the injury during his first and only snap of the Vikings\u2019 preseason win against the Houston Texans.\n\nExpected to compete for the Vikings\u2019 punt returner job, Moore was injured during a 2-yard return while he was tackled from behind by Texans linebacker Jamal Hill in the second quarter.\n\nCoach Kevin O\u2019Connell called the injury \u201cheartbreaking\u201d for Moore, who also spent the past year on injured reserve with the Atlanta Falcons rehabbing from what Vikings special teams coordinator Matt Daniels called a dislocated right kneecap suffered during practice last summer.\n\nMoore had worked his way back from last year\u2019s injury to sign a one-year, $2 million deal with the Vikings in March that came with $250,000 guaranteed.\n\nDaniels will have to look elsewhere for a new punt returner. Internal candidates include four receivers \u2014 Lucky Jackson, Jalen Nailor, Silas Bolden and Myles Price \u2014 who fielded punt returns during Monday\u2019s practice at the team\u2019s Eagan headquarters.\n\nReceiver Brandon Powell also remains a free agent after averaging 7.1 yards per punt return last season for the Vikings.",

      "text": "The Vikings may be without their leading punt returner candidate for an extended period.\nReceiver Rondale Moore was carted off in the second quarter of Saturday\u2019s 20-10 preseason win against the Houston Texans with \u201ca pretty significant left knee\u201d injury, coach Kevin O\u2019Connell said, that will require further imaging.\nMoore, 25, went down on his first punt return midway through the second quarter at U.S. Bank Stadium. O\u2019Connell joined players in kneeling around Moore as he was evaluated by medical staff. The coach also talked with officials about whether Texans linebacker Jamal Hill had brought down Moore with an illegal hip-drop tackle.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I was asking about,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cIt seemed like it had a lot of the characteristics of [a hip-drop tackle], but I know it is a three-part kind of process to actually call that on the field. I don\u2019t think there was any bad intent there.\u201d\nReceivers Lucky Jackson and Silas Bolden are listed as the team\u2019s second and third punt return options. Bolden fielded two punts after Moore\u2019s injury, taking one for an 8-yard return.\nMoore took his helmet off almost immediately after hitting the ground on the Texans\u2019 sideline near the Vikings\u2019 11-yard line. He could be seen on video replay grabbing at his left knee.\nMoore\u2019s left leg was extended on the cart, and a trainer had a hand on it, but he was not placed in an air cast. He had a towel over his head and pounded the cart with his hands as he left the field.\nMoore, the 2021 second-round pick by the Arizona Cardinals out of Purdue, had spent the past year rehabbing from what Vikings special teams coordinator Matt Daniels called a dislocated right kneecap suffered during practice last summer. Moore did not play in 2024. He may not play this year if this injury is indeed significant."
