  "title": "Trump says he will clear out Washington\u2019s homeless population but offers few details.",
  "description": "D.C.\u2019s mayor acknowledged local officials could do little to block what was expected to be a 30-day takeover of the capital\u2019s policing. President Trump suggested his action might be expanded to other cities.",
  "content": "Trump says he will clear out Washington\u2019s homeless population but offers few details. Tents set up near the Institute of Peace in Washington, D.C., on Monday. Nonprofit agencies that serve homeless residents of Washington were left with little idea of what to expect on Monday after President Trump declared he would clear out the capital\u2019s homeless population without saying how it would be done or where homeless people would go. Mr. Trump, during a news conference announcing that Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department would be placed under federal control for 30 days, said that officers from the department, alongside federal authorities, are \u201cgetting rid of the people from underpasses and public spaces from all over the city.\u201d Mr. Trump, who has spent months railing against daily living conditions in Washington, said on Monday that the city had been overwhelmed by \u201cbloodthirsty criminals\u201d and homeless people. In fact, data from the Metropolitan Police Department shows that violent crime in the city is at a 30-year-low, and according to city data, homelessness fell 9 percent from January 2024 to January 2025. Efforts to clear homeless encampments in Washington predate the Trump administration and are overseen by the city government and the Metropolitan Police or the National Park Service, depending on whether the encampments are on city or federal land. The U.S. Park Police, a unit of the Park Service, has removed more than 70 encampments in the city since Mr. Trump signed an executive order in March requiring the Park Service to clear encampments on federal land in the city, Doug Burgum, the interior secretary, told reporters on Monday. Advocates for homeless people have long argued that encampment evictions simply displace residents from their communities and further exacerbate housing instability. \u201cBy doing sweeps and moving people out of their community, you\u2019re not solving the problem,\u201d said Ralph Boyd, the chief executive of So Others Might Eat, a Washington-based social services nonprofit. \u201cYou\u2019re just moving it somewhere else and arguably actually making it worse, because here in the district, if someone is unhoused, they\u2019re within shouting distance of services that can help them.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s latest promise to crack down on homelessness in Washington came after he demanded that homeless residents of the city leave \u201cIMMEDIATELY\u201d in a social media post on Sunday. \u201cWe will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital,\u201d he wrote. It remained unclear how the federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police could change its role in the crackdown \u2014 for example, whether the police department\u2019s enforcement would now focus on federal land or would continue to remove people camping on city property. \u201cNobody really knows how this is going to play out,\u201d said Andy Wassenich, director of policy at Miriam\u2019s Kitchen, a nonprofit that provides food and housing services for the homeless. Washington, Mr. Wassenich said, does not have the capacity to move every person living on the streets into shelters \u2014 not even to move them into jails or hospitals, as Mr. Trump has threatened to do. \u201cWhere are they going to take them?\u201d Mr. Wassenich asked. For now, the street outreach team of Miriam\u2019s Kitchen, which covers 33 square miles in the northwestern parts of the city, is relaying news of the federal police takeover to homeless residents and conveying some of the possibilities \u2014 that Metropolitan Police could make them move or hospitalize them, Mr. Wassenich said. The overarching message, he said, is that it is not a safe time to be living outside in Washington, and that anyone who can find a shelter bed or temporarily stay with friends or family should try to do so. Mr. Wassenich added that Mr. Trump was taking a criminal approach to what is fundamentally an economic problem \u2014 a shortage of affordable housing. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with people who have a sixth-grade education and people who have master\u2019s degrees from Ivy League universities,\u201d he said of the homeless. \u201cThe one thing they had in common is that they couldn\u2019t afford rent.\u201d\n\nNew York\u2019s Democratic governor called in the troops last year to fight subway crime. Members of the National Guard patrolling the New York subway system in 2024. Adam Gray for The New York Times President Trump is not the only elected leader to deploy National Guard troops in response to a supposed crime wave that many have questioned. In March 2024, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York, a Democrat, announced that she would deploy 750 members of the National Guard to New York\u2019s subway system. It was a jarring sight to some New Yorkers who were not accustomed to seeing troops in military uniforms patrolling the subway with rifles. There is an important difference between the situation in Washington, and the one in New York, however: Ms. Hochul, as New York\u2019s governor, controls the state\u2019s National Guard and can deploy it as she sees fit. Mr. Trump, on the other hand, is sending the Guard into the streets of Washington against the wishes of the city\u2019s leaders, just as he sent the National Guard to the streets of Los Angeles in June over objections from both the mayor and California\u2019s governor. In the subways, Ms. Hochul said the deployment worked. Crime in the subway declined 27 percent in the 12 months following the troops\u2019 arrival, she said. This summer, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority experienced its safest July on record, with an 8 percent drop in major felony crimes compared to July 2024, according to data from the governor\u2019s office. Others point to data that suggests the Guard deployment may have had little effect, since crime in the subway was already declining before Ms. Hochul\u2019s announcement. The rates of rape, robbery, burglary and assault all spiked in early 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a report by Vital City, an urban policy think tank. By the middle of 2020, transit crime started to retreat across nearly all categories. That drop in subway crime has continued. It fell by another 2 percent in the first half of 2025, led by declines in harassment and misdemeanor assaults. One type of crime increased, however: felony assaults, which typically involve more serious injuries than misdemeanor assaults. There were 349 felony assaults reported in the subway in the first six months of 2025, a 7 percent increase over the same period last year, according to police data. While crime totals are down, anecdotal reports of disturbing, violent and sometimes fatal crimes in the subway still grip the city at times. Weeks before the National Guard troops were deployed, a train conductor was slashed. The next day, some New York City Transit workers stopped work for several hours to call attention to safety problems, causing delays across the system. Daniel Lambright, special counsel for criminal justice litigation at the New York Civil Liberties Union, said that the troop deployments in Washington and New York had less to do with deterring crime than with politics. \u201cThey\u2019re really just efforts of political theater to appeal to their political bases,\u201d he said. In June, after Mr. Trump sent the National Guard to Los Angeles, Ms. Hochul and other prominent Democrats released a statement accusing him of overreach. \u201cIt\u2019s important we respect the executive authority of our country\u2019s governors to manage their National Guards,\u201d the statement said. On Monday, a spokeswoman for Ms. Hochul, Emma Wallner, said in a statement, \u201cTrump\u2019s betting that his fear-mongering tactics will distract from his Administration\u2019s failed policies.\u201d Danny Pearlstein, a spokesman for Riders Alliance, which represents New York transit users, pointed out that the city and state already spent hundreds of millions of dollars a year policing the subway before the National Guard was deployed. \u201cWe\u2019re using the wrong tool,\u201d Mr. Pearlstein said. \u201cWe already have law enforcement. What\u2019s missing is housing and health care\u201d for people in the subway \u2014 and across the city \u2014 who are homeless and experiencing mental health crises, he said.\n\nMuriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington, D.C., during a Monday news conference. Muriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington, on Monday called President Trump\u2019s announced takeover of the city\u2019s police force \u201cunsettling and unprecedented\u201d but appeared resigned to cooperate with it, stressing at a news conference that there was little she could do to block the move. She repeatedly characterized Mr. Trump\u2019s federalization of the city\u2019s police force, under an emergency declaration to combat a crime \u201ccrisis\u201d despite falling violent crime rates, as a workable extension of the oftentimes collaborative relationship between federal and local law enforcement entities tasked to the nation\u2019s capital. Ms. Bowser\u2019s tone was strikingly diplomatic, an approach in keeping with the more muted posture she has adopted toward Mr. Trump during his second term, as compared to more fiery statements during his first term opposing similar threats to the city\u2019s limited autonomy. The \u201cplain language\u201d of the city\u2019s home rule charter, she explained, authorized the president to declare a public safety emergency and request the city to defer to the directions of the federal government. And, she added, \u201cit says the mayor shall comply with those requests.\u201d Under the Home Rule Act of 1973, which gave D.C. the power to elect its own local government but left Congress with ultimate power over the city\u2019s laws and budget, Mr. Trump can declare a state of emergency to assert control over local law enforcement for 30 days. \u201cWe have a responsibility to support the executive order and one of the roles I have is to ensure that we work very collaboratively with our federal partners,\u201d she said, later adding: \u201cOur relationship with our federal partners is not new, we do this on a daily basis.\u201d But despite her calm demeanor, it was clear that Ms. Bowser viewed Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement as fundamentally different than anything the city has experienced in decades. \u201cI don\u2019t want to minimize what was said, and I don\u2019t want too minimize the intrusion on our autonomy,\u201d she told reporters. She dismissed Mr. Trump\u2019s assertions of a crime-ridden D.C. as fundamentally divorced from fact, rattling off statistics indicating that the city had actually reversed a crime wave that rose on the heels the Covid-19 pandemic and crested in 2023. She argued that Mr. Trump was fully aware of those details. \u201cIn every conversation I have with him, we\u2019re always briefing the president on our progress,\u201d she said. In their first meeting after Mr. Trump\u2019s November re-election, she added, \u201cwe went over the crime trends, we went over how we\u2019re seeing decreases, so the president is read in on our efforts.\u201d The city\u2019s murder rate, while higher than it was 15 years ago, has been dropping over the past 18 months and is now where it was before the pandemic. The number of carjackings has also dropped precipitously after a steep spike in 2023. City officials say that violent crime generally is at a 30-year low, and while the F.B.I. measures violent crime somewhat differently than the district, the recent trend in the city is clear. Ms. Bowser said that city leaders would \u201ccontinue to look for ways to make our city safe,\u201d praising the local police force for their efforts. She also insisted that Chief Pamela Smith would remain in charge of the D.C. police, working with the administration while the force answers to the Department of Justice, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s suggestion that there would be a change in leadership. Still, Ms. Bowser was careful not to express direct anger at Mr. Trump in her own words, referring instead to a statement from Brian Schwalb, the D.C. attorney general, to communicate her umbrage at Mr. Trump\u2019s move. On Monday, Mr. Schwalb put out a statement calling Mr. Trump\u2019s takeover \u201cunprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful,\u201d adding that city officials \u201care considering all of our options and will do what is necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents.\u201d Ms. Bowser instead directed her most palpable frustrations toward Congress, pointing out that lawmakers had opportunities in recent years to put more power in the hands of Washington residents and its mayor, but had chosen not to. Ms. Bowser, like other past leaders of Washington, has been a staunch advocate for statehood, which would give the city the ability to govern itself and ensure that its residents had voting representation in Congress. In 2020 and 2021, the House of Representatives, then led by Democrats, passed bills that would have granted D.C. statehood, but neither passed the Senate. Ms. Bowser also pointed out that lawmakers had an opportunity to put the D.C. National Guard under the mayor\u2019s authority, and didn\u2019t. When asked Monday about Mr. Trump\u2019s threats to deploy additional active duty military units beyond the National Guard to D.C., she said she did not believe it was legal \u201cto use the American military against American citizens on American soil.\u201d Several Democrats said they planned to introduce bills or legislation to address Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement and reverse its effects. They include Representative Jamie Raskin, whose Maryland district includes Washington suburbs, who said he would introduce a resolution to \u201creverse this plainly ridiculous state of local emergency\u201d and restore local control to D.C.\u2019s government. Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia\u2019s nonvoting delegate, and Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland have also said they would reintroduce bills that would repeal the president\u2019s authority to take temporary control of the D.C. police and that would give the city\u2019s mayor authority over the D.C. National Guard. These measures face an uphill climb to pass a Republican-controlled Congress, particularly given a 60-vote threshold needed to pass most legislation.\n\nTrump has pulled the military into yet another political issue. President Trump has previously used the military to advance his domestic agenda by deploying around 10,000 active-duty troops to the southwest U.S. border and 5,700 National Guard troops and Marines to quell protests in Los Angeles. President Trump\u2019s decision to send at least 800 National Guard troops into the streets of Washington to fight crime is the latest example of how the president has used the military to advance domestic policy priorities. Though crime rates in the capital have been falling, Mr. Trump has said that they are \u201ctotally out of control\u201d and has threatened a federal takeover. Already this year, Mr. Trump has deployed some 10,000 active-duty troops to the southwest U.S. border to choke off the flow of drugs as well as migrants, and 4,700 National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles to help quell protests that had erupted over immigration raids and to protect the federal agents conducting them. All but about 250 of those National Guard troops have since been withdrawn. Mr. Trump last month secretly signed a directive to the Pentagon to begin using military force against certain Latin American drug cartels that his administration has deemed terrorist organizations. The National Guard troops who will fan out across Washington starting this week will not perform law enforcement tasks, Pentagon officials said on Monday. Instead, 100 to 200 Guard soldiers at any given time will help with such tasks as logistics and transportation, while providing a \u201cphysical presence\u201d in support of federal agents, the Army said in a statement. But like the Guard in Los Angeles, the soldiers in Washington will probably be able to detain people temporarily in certain circumstances until federal agents arrive, officials said. The soldiers will be armed and authorized to defend themselves, military officials said. \u201cYou will see them flowing into the streets of Washington in the coming week,\u201d Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a former National Guard infantryman, said at a White House news conference on Monday morning, standing next to Mr. Trump. Mr. Hegseth offered no details on how long the National Guard would be deployed in the capital. But he said they \u201cwill be strong, they will be tough and they will stand with their law enforcement partners.\u201d The Pentagon is contacting National Guards in other states, including \u201cspecialized units,\u201d in case reinforcements are needed, Mr. Hegseth said. But a senior Army official said the 800 D.C. Guard soldiers tapped for duty should be sufficient. In a Truth Social post on Monday morning, Mr. Trump said, \u201cI will, MAKE OUR CAPITAL GREAT AGAIN!\u201d Unlike a state\u2019s governor, the District of Columbia does not have control over its National Guard, giving the president broad leeway to deploy those troops. The D.C. Guard\u2019s chain of command runs from its commanding general to the secretary of the Army to Mr. Hegseth to the president. The U.S. military responds quickly to executive directives. For that reason, it is a preferred institution for a president who presents himself as tough on crime, undocumented immigrants, drugs, \u201cwoke\u201d culture and other perceived domestic enemies. But in recent months that has put the military at the center of a series of partisan political issues, traditionally where its leaders in the past have least wanted to be. Mr. Trump\u2019s directive deploying National Guard troops to Washington \u201cis a fraught one because it will seem partisan from the get-go,\u201d said Peter Feaver, a political science professor at Duke University. \u201cThe military does not train for normal police beat-walking missions,\u201d Mr. Feaver said in an interview. Military leaders are trying to keep the rules of engagement for the D.C. mission as narrow as possible, one Defense Department official said, so that soldiers with M-16s who have been trained to kill adversaries are not put in policing roles. \u201cThis is part of a pattern where the administration is using and appropriating military resources for nonmilitary domestic goals,\u201d said Carrie A. Lee, the former chair of the department of national security and strategy at the Army War College. \u201cWhether it\u2019s immigration or going against drug cartels or crime in Washington, it\u2019s very clear, to me at least, that this administration sees the military as a one-size-fits-all solution to its accomplishing its domestic political priorities.\u201d Critics in Congress also assailed the new directive. \u201cOur military is trained to defend the nation from external threats and assist communities during disasters or emergencies, not to conduct day-to-day domestic policing,\u201d Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. \u201cThis deployment is a serious misuse of the National Guard\u2019s time and talent.\u201d During Mr. Trump\u2019s first term, Pentagon and military leaders cautioned him against using troops to shoot racial justice protesters in the legs, as former aides have said he suggested. He heeded their warnings, though some National Guard soldiers used aggressive tactics against protesters. But in Mr. Hegseth, Mr. Trump now has a defense secretary who has enthusiastically supported the president\u2019s desire to use military force inside the country. For the troops, and for the military in general, there could be risks in calling on them for matters traditionally handled by other institutions. In some cases, troops could feel pitted against their own neighbors. \u201cThey\u2019re members of the community, which is why these types of missions are very unpopular with those serving,\u201d said Dr. Lee, who is now a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund. \u201cYou\u2019re being asked to threaten force against the people whose kids may go to school with yours.\u201d In interviews with The New York Times, members of the California National Guard said the deployment to Los Angeles had eroded the morale of a force that, during the January wildfires, had been welcomed by many in the city. Guard officials also expressed concerns that the deployment would hurt re-enlistment. For the military as a whole, the cost could come in recruiting and retention, military experts say, as few join the military to police the Washington metro area. Mr. Trump\u2019s order came two days after the retirement of Maj. Gen. John C. Andonie, the commanding general of the D.C. Guard. Brig. Gen. Leland D. Blanchard II was named acting commander. \u201cThe role of the National Guard is more relevant now than ever,\u201d said General Andonie, who is stepping down after 35 years of service. \u201cModern citizen-soldiers and airmen must be agile and flexible, as demonstrated by our Guard members responding to missions both at home and abroad.\u201d The D.C. Guard has more than 2,400 members, \u201cwith a longstanding commitment to national defense and community,\u201d the Guard said in a statement about the change of command.\n\nTrump takes control of the D.C. police, citing \u2018bloodthirsty criminals.\u2019 But crime is down. \u201cOur capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people,\u201d President Trump claimed on Monday, despite falling crime in Washington. President Trump on Monday took federal control of the police force in the nation\u2019s capital for 30 days and mobilized 800 National Guard troops to fight crime in a city that he claimed was overrun with \u201cbloodthirsty criminals,\u201d even though crime numbers in Washington are falling. During a 78-minute news conference, during which he was flanked by several members of his cabinet, Mr. Trump took the lectern in the White House briefing room and said he also intended to clear out the capital\u2019s homeless population, without saying how officials would do it, or detailing where those people would go. Armed with papers that showed crime statistics, Mr. Trump decried murders in Washington compared with other global cities but ignored the fact that violent crime has fallen recently in the nation\u2019s capital. While the violent crime rate surged in 2023, it fell 35 percent from that year to 2024, according to the city\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department. From January 1 through August 10 each year A chart shows the number of violent crimes in Washington, D.C. from January 1 to August 10 each year from 2010 to 2025. Violent crimes have declined from a peak of nearly 3,300 in the 2023 time span to fewer than 1,600 in 2025, lower than pre-pandemic levels. Instead, Mr. Trump painted Washington as an urban hellscape, repurposing some of the incendiary language he has used to describe conditions at the southern border. Mr. Trump has railed against crime in urban, largely liberal cities for decades, but his announcement on Monday was an extraordinary exertion of federal power over an American city. Warning of \u201ccaravans of mass youth\u201d rampaging the city streets and relaying stories of children caught in shootings, Mr. Trump blamed Democrats for allowing the crime. \u201cOur capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore.\u201d Local officials immediately criticized the president\u2019s actions, and pockets of protesters sprang up around the city shortly after Mr. Trump declared a public safety emergency in Washington. Muriel Bowser, the mayor of Washington, said in a news conference on Monday afternoon that Mr. Trump\u2019s actions were \u201cunsettling and unprecedented,\u201d but not surprising. Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington called Mr. Trump\u2019s actions on Monday \u201cunsettling and unprecedented,\u201d but not surprising. \u201cI can\u2019t say that given some of the rhetoric of the past that we are totally surprised,\u201d Ms. Bowser said, before adding that the police chief, Pamela A. Smith, would remain in her position. Ms. Bowser acknowledged that the law gave Mr. Trump the authority to take over the department temporarily. But she disputed the idea that her administration had done little to curb violent crime in Washington. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody here and certainly nobody who works for me who wants to tolerate any level of crime,\u201d said Ms. Bowser, a Democrat. \u201cWe work every day to stop crime.\u201d There are practical questions about how Mr. Trump\u2019s plans would be implemented. The Trump administration is relying on a provision of the D.C. Home Rule Act, a law passed by Congress in 1973 establishing local control of Washington. The law gives the president the power to temporarily take over the Metropolitan Police Department. A White House official said the takeover would last 30 days, a time limit outlined in the law. Federal officials were still working out many of the operational details of the president\u2019s plan on Monday afternoon, even though small groups of agents had been conducting limited patrols over the weekend. The effort envisions about 500 federal law enforcement officers, drawn from a host of agencies that operate in Washington, to be used for some version of patrol or support roles of the local police, according to two officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the still-developing plan. That figure includes roughly 120 F.B.I. agents and about 50 deputy U.S. marshals, as well as agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, among other agencies. Some of those agents will be on foot or car patrol duty, while others may be assigned to be visible in high-crime or high-traffic areas, according to the officials. One complicating factor of using federal agents for essentially street-based police work is that those agents do not have the same authority as police officers to arrest people for minor criminal offenses, so the current view among Trump administration officials is that if federal agents see someone commit such a crime, they can stop and detain them until a local police officer arrives and makes an arrest. None of those details were available during Mr. Trump's briefing room appearance, during which he waxed on about his real estate experience, the \u201coceanfront property\u201d in Ukraine and his coming trip to \u201cRussia\u201d \u2014 he is actually going to Alaska to meet with Vladimir V. Putin, Russia\u2019s president. He did not say where city police officers, federal police officers and National Guard members would be stationed throughout the city. Mr. Trump said Attorney General Pam Bondi would oversee the broad effort. He said that Gadyaces S. Serralta, who was sworn in as the director of the U.S. Marshals Service this month, would oversee the police department alongside Terry Cole, who was sworn in as the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration less than a month ago. \u201cI hope I don\u2019t have to fire him in two weeks because he\u2019s too soft,\u201d Mr. Trump said after calling Mr. Serralta up to the briefing room lectern to shake his hand. \u201cIf you\u2019re soft, weak and pathetic, like so many people, I will fire you so fast.\u201d Attorney General Pam Bondi at the White House on Monday. She is expected to oversee the broad federal law enforcement crackdown on Washington. Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks seemed largely aimed at rewriting history and the reality of crime in Washington. Soon after he took office, Mr. Trump pardoned hundreds of rioters, some of them violent, who ransacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Many had already been convicted of their crimes and were serving their sentences before being immediately released in January. And in the summer of 2020, Mr. Trump deployed more than 5,000 National Guard troops to Washington to crack down on mostly peaceful demonstrators pushing for racial justice. That deployment was widely seen as a debacle. One by one, Mr. Trump summoned members of his cabinet and others to the lectern to discuss how they would carry out his orders. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said U.S. Park Police officers had been patrolling federal parkland and traffic circles in the city for months, and had removed dozens of encampments of homeless people. And Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, said 800 National Guard officers would be \u201cflowing\u201d into the city over the next week. Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia and a former Fox News personality, delivered a cable-ready monologue against laws in the District that prevent charging minors as adults. \u201cI see too much violent crime being committed by young punks who think that they can get together and gangs and crews and beat the hell out of you or anyone else,\u201d Ms. Pirro said. \u201cWe need to go after the D.C. Council and their absurd laws.\u201d Mr. Trump and Ms. Pirro both denounced the use of no-cash bail in Chicago and in Washington, where it has been effectively eliminated since 1992. The practice allows some defendants to be released from jail without posting bail that would help ensure their return to court. As he threatened to get involved with repealing no-cash bail in Chicago, Mr. Trump suggested that other cities would soon be subject to federal intervention, thought it is unclear what legal grounds he could use to exert federal control over them. \u201cI\u2019m going to look at New York in a little while,\u201d Mr. Trump said, \u201cand if we need to, we\u2019re going to do the same thing in Chicago, which is a disaster.\u201d Critics of the administration\u2019s efforts said Mr. Trump deserved part of the blame for crime in Washington. Ankit Jain, a shadow senator for the District of Columbia who is the capital\u2019s advocate in Congress in lieu of official senators, said the vacancy crisis in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, which prosecutes all adult crimes, had contributed to crime in the city. He also said the city is down two judges out of nine on its highest court, the D.C. Court of Appeals. \u201cWhat happens when you don\u2019t have enough judges? Trials get delayed, crime goes up,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy has the president not made this a priority of nominating judges?\u201d Several Washington residents said on Monday that the crime statistics relayed by the president had unnerved them, though they did not see the kind of violence he described. Others questioned whether calling the National Guard to Washington was necessary. \u201cI\u2019m not a particularly pro-police, pro-law enforcement kind of person,\u201d said Sarah Struble, 37, who lives in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. \u201cI would much rather resources go towards, you know, community support and services and things like that, things that our taxes support and things run by the community rather than bringing in the National Guard.\u201d Shanta Rigsby, 43, said crime had remained steady for the past five years in the Navy Yard neighborhood where she lives, with a noticeable rise after the pandemic. She said Mr. Trump should focus on addressing the root causes of crime before sending in the National Guard. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the new administration has to take this reactionary approach,\u201d Ms. Rigsby said, \u201cinstead of local government really focusing on bringing down crime and making residents feel safe.\u201d Reporting was contributed by Devlin Barrett , Darren Sands , Sonia A. Rao , Campbell Robertson , Chris Cameron and Annie Karni .\n\nTrump\u2019s deployment of the National Guard in L.A. remains contentious. The Trump administration deployed nearly 5,000 federal troops to Southern California in June. As President Trump announced on Monday that he was deploying National Guard troops to fight crime in the nation\u2019s capital, lawyers with his Justice Department were preparing to defend his use of the Guard in Los Angeles. Starting in early June, the Trump administration sent nearly 5,000 federal troops to Southern California over the objections of Gov. Gavin Newsom, citing protests over immigration raids in the region. The deployment was fraught with problems and lawsuits from the start, and a three-day trial began Monday in San Francisco federal court for a suit by state officials to end the activation. Since July 1, the Pentagon has released most of the roughly 4,000 members of the California National Guard who were federalized, along with 700 Marines. A sprawling tent city that was erected in June to house thousands of soldiers at a military base south of Los Angeles in Los Alamitos is being dismantled. Only about 300 troops remain. Testifying in federal court on Monday, William Harrington, who until last week was the deputy chief of staff for the Army task force with tactical control over the Guard troops, said that those still on duty in Los Angeles were \u201csupporting the request for assistance\u201d from federal law enforcement agents. But officials at the California National Guard and the military\u2019s Northern Command, which is overseeing the force, said earlier Monday that the remaining troops were mostly on standby or guarding federal buildings and not being used for immigration enforcement. The Los Angeles protests lasted several days in early June and were largely confined to a section of downtown. Democratic leaders in the state said the administration had provoked them by sending masked and armed federal agents into workplaces to detain immigrants who otherwise had no criminal records, then used the subsequent public outrage as a pretext to intervene militarily. Mayor Karen Bass of Los Angeles compared the mobilization to an \u201carmed occupation.\u201d Mr. Newsom called it political theater, and said the president was using service members as \u201cprops in the federal government\u2019s propaganda machine.\u201d Trump administration officials said the troops were necessary to protect federal agents in a jurisdiction where state sanctuary laws prohibited local authorities from conducting immigration enforcement. They said the protests had overwhelmed local law enforcement agencies. The state swiftly sued to end the mobilization, which a federal judge ruled to be illegal. But an appeals court blocked that ruling, allowing the deployment to continue. By mid-June, the protests had died down but the troops were accompanying federal agents conducting immigration enforcement. California officials say those assignments amount to an illegal use of federal troops to conduct domestic law enforcement. The Trump administration has contended the troops were merely escorting federal agents. In the interim, complaints have mounted from those who have been deployed. On the base near Los Angeles where the troops have been stationed, soldiers have complained that only a small fraction of them were even given assignments beyond the base. Those who were sent out typically were ordered to guard federal facilities or provide backup to immigration agents delivering warrants or conducting arrests. In July, for example, one National Guard contingent sat in trucks while immigration agents conducted a show of force in MacArthur Park in Los Angeles. Another contingent faced protesters in a field outside a cannabis farm during a raid in Ventura County. State authorities have complained that the activation has damaged the California National Guard\u2019s ability to handle other critical duties, including drug interdiction and wildfire management. In interviews with The New York Times, several members of the California National Guard said the deployment had threatened retention and severely eroded the morale of the force. The mission, which federal authorities had initially indicated would end on Aug. 6, has been extended for at least another 90 days. And last week, Mr. Trump said he would chair a task force designed to increase the federal government\u2019s role in the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, telling reporters that he would use the National Guard there again, if necessary, \u201cto keep the Olympics safe.\u201d\n\nProtesters gathered near the White House as Trump unveiled his plans. Protesters organized by the group Free D.C. gathered near the White House on Monday as President Trump announced plans to take over Washington\u2019s police department. About 150 people gathered a block north of the White House on Monday as President Trump laid out his plans to federalize the police force in Washington, D.C., protesting what they said was the president\u2019s latest attempt to assert control over the city. Mr. Trump is \u201ctrying to annex D.C. from the White House,\u201d said Lisa Walker, a Maryland resident who said she taught in the Washington public schools for 15 years. She carried a homemade sign reading: \u201cFree D.C. No Police State.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re usurping the concept of home rule,\u201d said Ken Greene, a longtime Washington resident, referring to the 1973 law that allowed the federal district to elect its own local government, though Congress maintained final say over its laws and budget. Mr. Trump cited a portion of that law on Monday that allows the federal government to temporarily take control of the city\u2019s police department. As the protesters rallied, Mr. Trump was framing his plans to beef up and militarize the district\u2019s police force as a test for his vision for getting tough on crime, musing that if it worked in the nation\u2019s capital, he could roll out similar efforts in other cities. But to the protesters, Mr. Trump\u2019s plans were just the latest blow to a city that has been among the hardest hit by his executive orders and policies. Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to downsize the federal government, step up immigration raids in urban areas, and reduce funding for food stamps have had a negative effect on city residents, organizers of the protest argued. \u201cIt\u2019s all connected,\u201d said Samuel Epps, the president of the Metropolitan Washington Council, AFL-CIO, whose office the protesters gathered outside. \u201cThis is just another way to create that chaos in our communities.\u201d Alex Dodds, one of the co-founders of Free D.C., an advocacy group formed just after the start of Mr. Trump\u2019s second term, said Mr. Trump was following an authoritarian playbook by trying to assert control over the capital city. \u201cIt\u2019s an easy way for them to silence dissent and accelerate their agenda, if they physically control the capital,\u201d said Ms. Dodds, whose group organized the protests. She added: \u201cD.C. is our home. It belongs to the people who live here, and Trump can\u2019t have it.\u201d Mr. Trump has frequently railed against crime in Washington. He became fixated on the idea of a federal takeover of local law enforcement after Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old software engineer and a prominent early member of the Department of Government Efficiency, was the victim of an attempted carjacking earlier this month. Though the protest was relatively small, criticism of Mr. Trump in Washington is not rare. The city is staunchly Democratic, and its residents have frequently rallied against the president\u2019s actions. Monday\u2019s protest took place on the same stretch of street that in 2020 became the centerpiece of Black Lives Matter protests \u2014 and had those words painted into the pavement until a couple of months ago.\n\nD.C.\u2019s advocate in the Senate says President Trump has contributed to crime by failing to add judges. President Trump declared a public safety emergency in Washington and invoked a section of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act. The crime rate in the nation\u2019s capital has been falling in spite of President Trump\u2019s actions in his second term, said Ankit Jain, a shadow senator for the District of Columbia, soon after the president announced a temporary takeover of policing in the city. \u201cWe have a historic judicial vacancy crisis in D.C.,\u201d said Mr. Jain, who serves as one of the District\u2019s elected advocates before the U.S. Senate. He noted that the city is down two judges out of nine on its high court, the D.C. Court of Appeals. \u201cWhat happens when you don\u2019t have enough judges? Trials get delayed, crime goes up,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy has the president not made this a priority of nominating judges?\u201d Mr. Jain said the vacancy crisis in the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, which prosecutes all adult crimes, also posed a problem for the city. Mr. Trump recently installed an ally, the former Fox News host Jeannine Pirro, as the U.S. attorney for Washington after he was forced his pull his first choice for the job. \u201cPirro\u2019s predecessor fired attorneys who prosecuted violent insurrectionists from Jan. 6,\u201d Mr. Jain said, referring to another Trump appointee, Ed Martin. \u201cNow we\u2019re facing a vacancy crisis in her office, too.\u201d Mr. Jain said Mr. Trump\u2019s his efforts to exert federal authority over the nation\u2019s capital did not appear to offer any long term solutions to crime. \u201cAnd I\u2019m incredibly concerned about what he is going to use the police force to do to the people of D.C.,\u201d he added. The takeover of the city police department was expected to last 30 days. That means that what Mr. Trump announced on Monday was essentially a show of force that will expire on Sept. 10. Mr. Jain is one of two shadow senators from the District of Columbia who serve as its elected advocates before the body. The other is Paul Strauss. They hold no voting power but lobby the Senate in favor of D.C. statehood, to prevent congressional interference in its affairs, and pass laws that protect D.C.\u2019s interests. Mr. Jain said there was only one real way for Washington to protect itself. \u201cWe need D.C. statehood to stop this problem,\u201d he said.\n\nDistrict residents say they feel safe, but occasionally unnerved. Eric Lee for The New York Times Like several District of Columbia residents interviewed Monday morning, Sarah Struble, 37, who lives in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, said she feels relatively safe, though the high-profile incidents of violence like those mentioned by President Trump during his news conference can be unnerving. Crime is \u201cnot something that is impacting me personally in my life every day,\u201d said Ms. Struble. She said she liked that law enforcement officers don\u2019t walk streets with military-style firearms as they do in some countries, and she said she did not support the president\u2019s moves to take over Washington\u2019s police and deploy the National Guard. \u201cI\u2019m not a particularly pro-police, pro-law enforcement kind of person,\u201d she said. \u201cI would much rather resources go towards, you know, community support and services and things like that, things that our taxes support and things run by the community rather than bringing in the National Guard.\u201d Shanta Rigsby, 43, said crime had remained steady for the past five years in the Navy Yard neighborhood where she lives, with a noticeable rise after the pandemic. She said Mr. Trump should focus on addressing the root causes of crime before sending in the National Guard. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the new administration has to take this reactionary approach,\u201d said Ms. Rigsby, \u201cinstead of local government really focusing on bringing down crime and making residents feel safe.\u201d Jerry Stenquist, 42, a federal employee who works in Navy Yard, said that some crime is inevitable with big events like baseball games for the Washington Nationals at the stadium in the neighborhood. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice area,\u201d Mr. Stenquist said of the Navy Yard, \u201cbut I think anytime you have a broad range of the public that\u2019s going to show up at the stadium, you\u2019re going to have some crime.\u201d Jeffrey Willis, 66, a retiree, said the idea of Washington losing its autonomy was \u201cinsulting to me as a voter. It\u2019s patronizing, and I just think it\u2019s frightening for the country.\u201d Mr. Willis lives in the U Street corridor, home to the African American Civil War Memorial, where, he said, large crowds of rowdy young people sometimes gather well into the wee hours of the morning. \u201cNobody should be out wandering around in the morning,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be nothing but trouble.\u201d",

  "summary": "President Donald Trump has promised to clear out Washington's homeless population, without providing any specific details on how it would be done or where homeless people would go. The announcement came during a news conference announcing that the Metropolitan Police Department will be placed under federal control for 30 days. The move comes amid concerns that the city is overwhelmed by criminals and homeless people, despite violent crime levels at a 30-year low and that homelessness will fall 9% from January 2024 to January 2025. Efforts to clear homeless encampments in Washington have long precedented and are currently overseen by the city government and the National Park Service, depending on whether the encampments are on city or federal land. Advocates for homeless people argue that evictions simply displace residents from their communities and exacerbate housing instability. It is unclear how this will change the enforcement role in the crackdown. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York announced that she would deploy 750 National Guard troops in response to a crime wave that many have questioned.",

      "text": "Press Release\nViolent Crime in D.C. Hits 30 Year Low\nFor Immediate Release\nU.S. Attorney's Office, District of Columbia\nWASHINGTON - Total violent crime for 2024 in the District of Columbia is down 35% from 2023 and is the lowest it has been in over 30 years, according to data collected by the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) and announced by United States Attorney Matthew M. Graves. A breakdown of the data is available here.\nIn addition to the overall violent crime reduction, homicides are down 32%; robberies are down 39%; armed carjackings are down 53%; assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 27% when compared with 2023 levels, with the District reporting the fewest assaults with dangerous weapons and burglaries in over 30 years.\n\u201cThe strategy this Office began to employ shortly after I came into this role has been to work with our law enforcement partners to focus on the drivers of violence - those gangs or crews of people who are dealing drugs, protecting turf, committing carjackings and other robberies, all while armed,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Graves. \u201cIt takes time to develop these investigations and prosecutions, but this is the fruit of that labor - a reduction in the violent crime - that D.C. is now seeing.\u201d\nA central component of this strategy has been targeting those crews who have preyed upon certain neighborhoods in our community, often operating drug trafficking networks in these neighborhoods. These proactive investigations and prosecutions have yielded immediate reductions in violence that have had lasting impact. For instance, an MPD analysis of crime trends in the area around MLK Mellon before and after a crew operating a drug market in that area was arrested revealed that there was a 66% reduction in violent crime in the area when comparing the six months prior to the arrests to the six months after the arrests. Even two years after these arrests, there was a 56% reduction in the number of homicides that occurred after the arrests when compared to the two years before.\nAnother key component of this proactive approach was implementing in April 2022, Project Safe Neighborhood - a daily review by the Office and our law enforcement partners of every firearms arrest in the District to determine, using objective criteria about the person arrested and the firearm recovered, whether the case should be charged in U.S. District Court or D.C. Superior Court. Since April 2022, the Office has accepted for prosecution in U.S. District Court more than 150 gun offenders under this initiative.\nFinally, the Office has continued to do all that it can to hold accountable those who commit violent crimes with firearms and those who illegally possess firearms. And the Office has committed to provide on a quarterly basis data related to these efforts - data that can be found here. This data reflects that in the first half of 2024, the Office was able to charge at the time of arrest more than 90% of arrests for violent crimes committed with guns and nearly 70% of gun possession arrests. The Office continues to investigate many of these arrests even if it does not charge on the day of arrest. Also in the first half of 2024, the Office obtained convictions in approximately 75% of these gun-related cases.\nThese numbers related to firearms offenses are critical and stand in stark contrast to the overall day-of-arrest charging rate for every arrest in the District of Columbia, which is a significantly less informative metric. The vast majority of arrests in the District of Columbia are for misdemeanor offenses that are often non-violent in nature. For such offenses, the Office has had a longstanding practice of giving great weight to victims\u2019 wishes about whether they want charges brought. For a variety of reasons, a substantial number of victims do not want criminal charges brought for these relatively minor offenses.\nIn Fiscal Year 2019, the Office expanded into a new section the number of prosecutors devoted to reviewing arrests and examining body-worn camera (BWC) footage - Fiscal Year 2018 was the first Fiscal Year where BWC had been fully deployed for the entire year - to determine whether the BWC footage reflected issues that would later require the Office to dismiss a prosecution or if there were otherwise fatal flaws with the case. This section is called the Early Case Assessment Section (ECAS). The combination of BWC footage and ECAS\u2019s early detection of arrests that, if charged, would later need to be dismissed led to relatively modest decreases in cases charged at the time of arrest in Fiscal Years 2018 and 2019.\nThe overall day-of-arrest charging rate dropped dramatically in Fiscal Years 2020, 2021, and 2022, as the global pandemic brought the criminal justice system to a halt and the D.C. Department of Forensic Sciences lost its accreditation in 2021.\nOur Office, along with our local partners, worked to overcome these challenges and the overall day-of-arrest charging rate in Fiscal Year 2024 of 57% is virtually identical to the 54% day-of-arrest charging rate that the Office reported in Fiscal Year 2019 after forming ECAS. More significantly, though, the Office dismissed far fewer of the cases it charged in Fiscal Year 2024 than it did in Fiscal Year 2018, so more arrests resulted in a prosecutorial outcome in Fiscal Year 2024 than in Fiscal Year 2018. For felonies, in particular, the percentage of cases with a prosecutorial outcome rose from 66% in Fiscal Year 2018 to 85% in Fiscal Year 2024.\nThere is value in addressing the issues, such as the lack of drug testing, that were preventing our Office from charging, at the time-of-arrest, non-violent misdemeanor offenses. While charging more non-violent offenses can benefit the community and offenders are often sentenced to periods of probation with services that hopefully aid in rehabilitation, these cases typically do not identify and remove violent offenders from the community. As is universally recognized, targeting the relatively limited number of individuals responsible for driving gun violence is the most impactful thing that prosecutors can do to contribute to the kinds of sharp declines in violent crime the District saw in 2024. To that end, multiple proactive investigations are already underway that should further reduce violent crime in 2025.\n##\nFollow us on Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube\nOr at https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc\nContact\nUpdated January 3, 2025\nTopic\nViolent Crime\nComponent"

      "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 740 of the District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act (Public Law 93-198), as amended (section 740 of the Home Rule Act), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1. Crime is out of control in the District of Columbia. Washington, District of Columbia, is our Nation\u2019s capital and home to the central institutions of American governance. Yet rising violence in the capital now urgently endangers public servants, citizens, and tourists, disrupts safe and secure transportation and the proper functioning of the Federal Government, and forces the diversion of critical public resources toward emergency response and security measures. The city government\u2019s failure to maintain public order and safety has had a dire impact on the Federal Government\u2019s ability to operate efficiently to address the Nation\u2019s broader interests without fear of our workers being subjected to rampant violence.\nThe increase in violent crime in the heart of our Republic has consequences beyond the individual tragedies that have dominated media coverage. Such lawlessness also poses intolerable risks to the vital Federal functions that take place in the District of Columbia. Violence and crime hamper the recruitment and retention of essential Federal employees, undermine critical functions of Government and thus the well-being of the entire Nation, and erode confidence in the strength of the United States. These conditions are disgraceful anywhere, but particularly in the capital of our Nation and the seat of the Federal Government. Citizens, tourists, and Federal workers deserve peace and security, not fear and violence. The smooth functioning of executive departments and agencies, courts, diplomatic missions, and the Federal Government demands an effective law-enforcement mechanism capable of halting the precipitous rise in violent crime, not one that permits Government workers to be violently attacked by mobs or fatally shot close to the Federal buildings where they work.\nThe magnitude of the violent crime crisis places the District of Columbia among the most violent jurisdictions in the United States. In 2024, the District of Columbia averaged one of the highest robbery and murder rates of large cities nationwide. Indeed, the District of Columbia now has a higher violent crime, murder, and robbery rate than all 50 States, recording a homicide rate in 2024 of 27.54 per 100,000 residents. It also experienced the Nation\u2019s highest vehicle theft rate with 842.4 thefts per 100,000 residents \u2014 over three times the national average of 250.2 thefts per 100,000 residents. The District of Columbia is, by some measures, among the top 20 percent of the most dangerous cities in the world.\nAs President, I have a solemn duty to take care that our laws are faithfully executed, and a sacred responsibility to protect the safety and security of United States citizens who live in and visit our Nation\u2019s capital, including Federal workers who live or commute into the District of Columbia. These conditions cannot persist. We will make the District of Columbia one of the safest cities in the world, not the most dangerous.\nSec. 2. Services of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia. I determine that special conditions of an emergency nature exist that require the use of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (Metropolitan Police force) for Federal purposes, including maintaining law and order in the Nation\u2019s seat of Government; protecting Federal buildings, national monuments, and other Federal property; and ensuring conditions necessary for the orderly functioning of the Federal Government. Effective immediately, the Mayor of the District of Columbia (Mayor) shall provide the services of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes for the maximum period permitted under section 740 of the Home Rule Act.\nSec. 3. Operational Control of the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia. (a) The authority of the President conferred by section 740(a) of the Home Rule Act to direct the Mayor with respect to the current special conditions of an emergency nature is delegated to the Attorney General.\n(b) In accordance with section 740(a) of the Home Rule Act, the Mayor shall provide such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the Attorney General may deem necessary and appropriate.\nSec. 4. Monitoring and Recommendations. (a) The Attorney General shall monitor and regularly consult with any senior official the Attorney General deems appropriate on the special conditions of an emergency nature that exist in the District of Columbia that require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes.\n(b) The Attorney General shall regularly update me on the status of the special conditions of an emergency nature that exist in the District of Columbia that require the use of the Metropolitan Police force for Federal purposes.\n(c) The Attorney General shall inform me of any circumstances that, in the Attorney General\u2019s opinion, might indicate the need for further action by the President or that the action in this order is no longer necessary.\nSec. 5. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any individual or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its other provisions to any other individuals or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\nSec. 6. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n(d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of Justice.\nDONALD J. TRUMP\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nAugust 11, 2025."

A good enterprise story shares some elements with investigative journalism, because both require deep reporting to dig up something new. But while investigative stories uncover information that someone in power hopes to hide, a good enterprise piece describes a phenomenon in our economy, politics or culture, ideally something no one has identified before. The writing should be beautiful. And since I write for the Times\u2019s Metro desk, the focus is on New York City and the surrounding area.

      "text": "(Washington, DC) \u2013 Today, Mayor Muriel Bowser and the District\u2019s Department of Human Services (DHS) shared the results of the 2025 Point-In-Time (PIT) Count, the annual census of individuals experiencing homelessness. This year\u2019s count took place on Wednesday, January 29, 2025, and showed an overall 9% decrease from 2024, including an 18.1% decrease among families and an 4.5% decrease among unaccompanied individuals. This year\u2019s total count is 19% percent lower than the count in 2020, the last PIT recorded before the COVID-19 public health emergency.\n\u201cI am incredibly grateful for the teams that are working every day to ensure we are able to not only provide shelter to neighbors who need it, but also help them move into \u2013 and thrive \u2013 in permanent housing,\u201d said Mayor Bowser. \u201cFor more than a decade, we have been transforming our systems so that they are more effective and so that they meet the needs of people in our city. This is challenging but important work. We know that when we have the right investments, the right policies, and the right people in place, we can drive down homelessness and get our neighbors into safe and stable housing.\u201d\nThe count also showed a decrease in homelessness among Transition Age Youth, which represents young adults ages 18 to 24. There was a 10.5% decrease among individual transition age youth and a 35.8% decrease among transition age youth-headed families.\n\u201cThese results show a positive change in course following increases in homelessness over the past two years,\u201d said DHS Interim Director A.D. Rachel Pierre. \u201cWhile there is more work to be done, this year\u2019s PIT count is a clear indicator that the District\u2019s investments \u2013 especially over the last year \u2013 are moving the needle in the right direction. We are committed to staying the course and continuing to focus on solutions that emphasize homelessness prevention and diversion, supportive case management, and bridging the gap from temporary shelter to permanent housing.\u201d\nSince last year\u2019s PIT count, the District has worked hard to deepen investment and focus on programs that work while launching new, innovative initiatives that continue to meet the needs of neighbors experiencing homelessness. These efforts have been key drivers of this year\u2019s positive trend, and they include:\n- Project Reconnect: The District deploys staff to shelters, day centers, and with outreach teams to assist individuals newly experiencing homelessness or who are currently facing housing crises by providing housing counseling and flexible funding to either divert individuals from the homeless services system or facilitate a rapid exit to stable housing. In FY 2024, Project Reconnect successfully diverted nearly 400 individuals from entering homelessness.\n- Front Door Navigation Tool: DHS launched a new data-powered tool in coordination with the Homeless Services Hotline to increase opportunities for connection to diversion assistance and resources in a timelier fashion. Since its launch, Front Door Navigation has connected more than 150 referrals to Project Reconnect.\n- Transforming Our Shelter System: The District continued its work to improve and expand its shelter system, including the opening of The Aston non-congregate bridge housing program to provide 100 new shelter beds for unsheltered, adult-only families (without minors) and those who cannot be served effectively in low barrier shelters. The District will open a second non-congregate bridge housing program in 2025.\n- Targeting Youth Homelessness: The District has been a national leader in building a comprehensive system to address and prevent youth homelessness. Through programs focused on homelessness prevention, intervention, and transitional and permanent housing, the District provided vital, targeted services to hundreds of Transition Age Youth (ages 18 to 24) over the last year \u2013 including the addition of daily transportation services through the District\u2019s shelter hotline and increasing the geographic footprint of youth-focused street outreach services.\n- Permanent Housing: The District supported more than 900 individuals and families to lease up with permanent housing vouchers in FY 2024 and leveraged Medicaid funding to provide supportive services to nearly 9,000 households. So far, in FY 2025, over 550 individuals and families have leased up with permanent housing vouchers.\n- Peer Case Management Institute (Winner of the Cafritz Team Award): DHS graduated its first cohort from the Peer Case Management Institute, a partnership with Howard University that trains District residents with lived experience of homelessness to become qualified case managers in the Homeless Services System. More than half of the first cohort has been employed as case managers in the Homeless Services System; the second cohort is set to graduate in June 2025.\nThe District\u2019s results were among the strongest in the region. Four of the eight continuums of care that participate in the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG) saw an increase in their numbers this year, with four others (including the District) seeing varying degrees of decrease. While this points to the positive impact of the District\u2019s targeted investments in strategic and innovative services, it also underscores the growing need of residents in the local region and the importance of regional collaboration.\nThe Community Partnership for the Prevention of Homelessness (TCP) conducted the PIT count on behalf of the District. The count is a requirement for all jurisdictions receiving federal homeless assistance funding. This single-day enumeration of the homeless services continuum of care provides an opportunity to identify gaps in the current portfolio of services and informs future program planning.\nData from the District will be included in a regional analysis and annual report on homelessness by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG) Homeless Services Planning and Coordinating Committee, presented to the COG Board of Directors on May 14. Concerned by the lack of regional data available, COG undertook the first effort to produce a Point-in-Time count of homeless adults and children in metropolitan Washington in 2001.

These days the war in Ukraine has been a principal focus, but topics can range from faraway conflicts to U.F.O.s.

For instance, I may not report on a coming raid by American special operations troops because publication of that information could harm said troops.

He also plans to clear the homeless population without providing details on how this will be accomplished or where the homeless will go. Local officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, criticized the move as unprecedented and unnecessary, arguing that it undermines the city's autonomy and that crime has been decreasing. Advocates for the homeless expressed concern that such actions merely displace individuals rather than address the root causes of homelessness.",
