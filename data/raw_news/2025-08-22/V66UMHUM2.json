  "title": "Plastics, Oil And ProSocial AI : Malaysia\u2019s Choice At The Crossroads",
  "description": "Plastic gridlock shows hybrid-era leadership: treat long-term issues as near-term opportunities, with ProSocial AI guiding systemic and shared solutions..",
  "content": "Global talks on plastic pollution in Geneva have once again last Sunday. After nearly two weeks \u2014 and three years of negotiations \u2014 countries could not agree on whether to cap plastic production or settle for focusing on waste and recycling. Are we stuck with the status quo, which has proven to be unsustainable for the health of people and planet? Or is ProSocial AI opening an alternative path, with some countries positioned to step into a leadership role?\n\nFor business leaders, this isn\u2019t distant geopolitics. The implications are direct. The OECD that global plastics use and waste could almost triple by 2060 without stronger policy, driving compliance costs and reputational risk higher. At the same time as the International Energy Agency notes that petrochemicals, including plastics, are now one of the biggest drivers of rising oil demand \u2014 explaining why some producers resist production caps, the United Nations Development Program raises alarm about the costs of microplastic for human health.\n\nRarely do the consequences of political choices feel less theoretical. Microplastics have been detected in the bodies of humans, animals, oceans and planets \u2014 evidence that exposure is systemic. It is weakening ecosystems that supply clean water, fertile soil and climate stability. Oceans and rivers clogged with plastics disrupt food chains, while burning plastic waste releases toxins and greenhouse gases. What once seemed a waste issue has become both a planetary boundary problem and a public health liability.\n\nFor companies, waiting for global consensus means waiting inside a fog of uncertainty. With plastics tied to oil demand growth, businesses face ever more fragmented regulations, rising compliance costs and sharper scrutiny from consumers who increasingly see plastics not just as waste, but as a health risk. The question becomes: why not face the inevitable and prepare for the future now?\n\nThe political paralysis also opens a window of opportunity. ProSocial AI \u2014 artificial intelligence tailored, trained, tested and targeted to serve both people and planet \u2014 can turn uncertainty into leadership. This isn\u2019t philanthropy; it\u2019s strategic innovation, risk mitigation, and a new frontier of market advantage.\n\nNot all AI is equal. ProSocial AI is different. It\u2019s:\n\u2022 Trained on high-integrity data aligned with social and environmental goals.\n\u2022 Tested for real-world impact \u2014 not just vanity pilots.\n\u2022 Targeted at root causes \u2014 production, design, system change \u2014 rather than downstream cleanup.\n\nA win-win-win-win for the people we are, the business we manage, the country we are part of and the planet we depend on.\n\nHere\u2019s how that translates into measurable advantages.\n\nMethane drives a big chunk of near-term warming, and it used to be \u201cinvisible.\u201d Now, MethaneSAT + Google marry satellite data with AI to detect, attribute and publish leaks so operators can fix the worst first \u2014 cutting product loss and regulatory risk.\n\nAI also makes clean megawatt-hours more schedulable. DeepMind\u2019s wind-power forecasting improved the market value of wind by enabling day-ahead commitments \u2014 good for grids and profits.\n\n2) Designing Out Waste Before It Exists\n\nRecycling treats symptoms; design treats causes. Using AI-guided protein engineering, researchers created FAST-PETase, an enzyme that breaks down PET (bottles, packaging, textiles) into reusable building blocks far faster than conventional processes \u2014 pointing toward circular, higher-value materials. It has yet to be scaled, but illustrates the potential of AI that is deliberately used for planetary friendly solutions.\n\n3) Proving Claims, Not Just Making New Ones\n\nCustomers and regulators now want proof: where materials came from, how much is recycled, and where products end up. AI-enabled tracking and verification can turn the label of ESG \u2013 environment, sustainability, governance \u2013 from an empty decoration narrative into auditable performance, shrinking fraud risk and speeding certification.\n\n4) Protecting The Natural Assets That Protect Us\n\nForests, rivers and wetlands are business infrastructure \u2014 flood control, clean water, climate resilience. AI on satellite and sensor data can spot illegal dumping or deforestation early, preventing damage that later shows up as supply shocks, insurance claims, or lost social license.\n\nIn 2022 scientists have first detected microplastics in human blood and the evidence base is expanding since. That takes plastics from a \u201cwaste problem\u201d to a potential liability problem for brands and insurers. In 2024 microplastics were found in every human placenta tested in a 62-sample study, underscoring concerns about exposure pathways.\n\nThe direction of travel is straightforward: pressure will keep moving upstream toward production limits, additive bans and traceable circularity. Companies that get ahead with ProSocial AI will be positioned as solution-makers \u2014 not defendants. The same holds true for countries.\n\nThe pro \u2013 On one hand, it is a producer of oil and gas and in Geneva the loudest resistance to production caps came from fossil-aligned nations. Civil society has also raised concerns about industry-linked voices in Malaysia\u2019s delegation, reinforcing the impression of a country holding the brakes.\n\nThe contra \u2013 On the other hand, Malaysia has declared an inspiring ambition to be an AI Nation. The aspiration has substance: a National AI Office, an AI Nation framework, and concrete steps such as a national cloud system, the ASEAN AI Summit and ILMU \u2014 a homegrown multimodal language model. These initiatives point to a government not only adopting technology but committing to shape it.\n\nThe opportunity \u2013 This dual identity can become a strength. If Malaysia chose to apply AI to its environmental and industrial challenges, it could move from being seen as a blocker to being recognized as a test bed for solutions. The path is not abstract. AI can verify recycled content and leakage prevention, enforce standards transparently against illegal dumping or land clearing, support the design of new circular materials, and cut energy use in factories and buildings. When paired with financial tools that reward prevention, these steps create both savings and exportable expertise.\n\nPart of the potential lies in how Malaysia develops its people alongside its technology. By investing in hybrid intelligence \u2014 the mix of human creativity, judgment, and ethics with machine speed and scale \u2014 Malaysia could give itself an edge that is difficult to copy. Schools and institutions are central here. Teaching double literacy \u2014 combining human literacy, a holistic understanding of self and society, people and planet; with algorithmic literacy \u2013 a candid comprehension of what AI is, how it works and why, prepares humans that can co-exist with machines without losing their agency, staying on course to the values that they have embraced.\n\nThe collapse in Geneva is frustrating. But it also makes the choice for individuals and institutions more apparent: don\u2019t wait for consensus \u2014 act regionally and corporately with the tools already available. ProSocial AI is not \u201ctech for tech\u2019s sake.\u201d It\u2019s a practical playbook for reducing risk and building resilience. It turns invisible leaks into visible data, shifts value toward predictable clean power and moves circularity from slogan to science. And it matches what the evidence already shows: plastic and oil are unsustainable; waiting only compounds the costs.\n\nMalaysia\u2019s choice mirrors the decision many economies face: stay tethered to fossil-era habits or lead with regenerative intent, leveraging an AI-Nation strategy with a ProSocial AI angle to chart the path that global politics cannot yet agree on. The planet will not wait forever.\n\nThe A-Frame: A Simple Way To Act On \u201cAbstract\u201d Issues\n\nWhen climate, plastics, or AI feel distant, the A-Frame can help ground decisions:\n\nAwareness \u2014 These risks are already inside our air, water, and products.\n\nAppreciation \u2014 Natural systems are assets. Value them before they are gone.\n\nAcceptance \u2014 Fossil-era mindsets will not carry growth into the next decade. Using technology to replicate yesterday\u2019s model won\u2019t deliver tomorrow\u2019s outcomes.\n\nAccountability \u2014 Incentives should be tied to prevention and verifiable results. Use AI not to entrench the old system, but to build a resilient new one.\n\nThe Geneva gridlock in plastic negotiations is just one more reminder that leadership in a hybrid era requires a conscious shift: to see long-term issues as near-term opportunities. The choice is intriguing \u2014 step in as a builder of systemic change or remain a bystander as the transformation happens to you.",

      "text": "In boardrooms and beyond an interesting shift has begun to reshape how some enterprises measure success. The traditional singular focus on profit is evolving into a more nuanced framework that balances four dimensions: people, planet, profit and purpose \u2014 the quadruple bottom line. At the intersection of this trend lies an emerging paradigm of artificial intelligence designed not just to optimize efficiency, but to optimize for humanity itself.\nThis transformation is still in its early stages. While the potential is compelling and early experiments show promise, the widespread adoption of ProSocial AI and quadruple bottom line thinking remains more of an aspiration than a reality across most industries. What we are witnessing are pioneering initiatives and foundational work being laid by forward-thinking institutions and entrepreneurs who recognize that the future of business may depend on getting this balance right.\nBeyond The Triple Bottom Line: Adding Purpose To The Equation\nThe quadruple bottom line concept evolves from the \"Triple Bottom Line\" (people, planet, profit) coined by John Elkington in 1994. It adds a fourth 'P\u2019: Purpose, recognizing that sustainable business success requires intentional alignment between technological innovation and human flourishing. While the triple bottom line prompted firms to consider their environmental and social impacts, purpose introduces a deeper sense of mission that transcends quarterly earnings and has the potential to inspire staff and customers.\nThis evolution is particularly relevant as AI becomes more integrated into business operations. Rather than viewing AI as merely a tool for efficiency and effectiveness, a small but growing number of organizations are exploring its potential as an instrument for social good..\nDefining ProSocial AI: Technology With Intention\nProSocial AI represents a shift from the traditional take on technology as an endeavor that is driven primarily by commercial interests. It refers to AI systems that are deliberately tailored, trained, and targeted to bring out the best in and for people and planet. Unlike conventional AI that optimizes for narrow metrics, ProSocial AI is architected with human welfare and environmental sustainability as primary objectives, not afterthoughts.\nThe distinction is important. Classic AI might optimize a supply chain for cost efficiency alone, potentially at the expense of worker welfare or environmental impact. In contrast, ProSocial AI would optimize for a holistic outcome that treats supply chain resilience, fair labor practices, environmental sustainability, and profitability as interconnected objectives.\nReal-World Applications: ProSocial AI In Practice\nBrewing Social Impact Win Win Coffee exemplifies the ProSocial AI approach by combining a social mission with technology. The company aims to \"bring equity to the coffee supply chain, centering the African diaspora.\" This mission is powered by its technology platform, ViaNexa, which uses AI and machine learning to remove bottlenecks and waste from the coffee supply chain. It leverages AI to implement dynamic pricing models, ensuring fairer compensation for farmers and more efficient, transparent transactions. This direct link between a consumer-facing brand and its purpose-built AI platform demonstrates a cohesive quadruple bottom line strategy in action, though its market share remains small compared to industry giants (for now).\nIntelligent Procurement with Purpose Stimulus represents an interesting example of ProSocial AI in a B2B context. Its AI-powered \"relationship intelligence platform\" helps companies make optimal purchasing decisions by factoring in a wide array of metrics beyond cost. Stimulus's algorithms analyze and score suppliers based on diversity, sustainability, and ethical practices, enabling companies to build supply chains that reflect their values while maintaining a competitive edge.\nFinancial Inclusion Through AI Some established fintech companies are also leveraging AI for social good. For example PayPal uses machine learning to assess creditworthiness for small businesses, particularly in underserved communities that traditional banks might overlook. By analyzing business performance data rather than relying solely on conventional credit scores, PayPal can provide capital to a broader range of entrepreneurs. During economic uncertainty, its AI systems can also help identify businesses at risk and proactively offer support, demonstrating how profit-driven companies can simultaneously drive positive social impact.\nChallenges To Widespread Prosocial AI Adoption\nDespite these promising examples, developing integrated systems remains technically challenging, as most current AI implementations still optimize for traditional business metrics. Selected factors hindering the widespread adoption of ProSocial AI:\nMeasurement Complexity: Social and environmental impacts are often difficult to quantify and integrate into algorithms. (Often \u201cmeasure what we treasure\u201d turns into \u201ctreasure what we measure\u201d, as investors \u2013 and in the case of nonprofits \u2013 donors, cherish hard metrics.)\nCompetitive Pressures: Companies may hesitate to adopt solutions that could increase short-term costs, even if they offer long-term benefits.\nTechnical Hurdles: Balancing multiple, sometimes competing, objectives requires sophisticated AI capabilities that many organizations lack.\nCultural Resistance: Shifting from a profit-maximizing mindset requires fundamental changes in organizational culture and incentives.\nThe Systems Thinking Advantage\nWhat distinguishes prosocial AI is its foundation in systems thinking. Rather than optimizing individual components in isolation, these systems recognize the interconnectedness of social, environmental, and economic factors. For example, a traditional AI in customer service might optimize for the lowest cost and fastest resolution time. A prosocial AI logic optimizes for customer satisfaction, agent well-being, and long-term relationship building and planetary footprint, recognizing that the interplay of these factors ultimately drive sustainable profitability.\nThe Economic Case For ProSocial AI\nWhile critics may argue that adding social and environmental considerations increases costs, emerging evidence suggests the opposite. Companies that integrate ProSocial AI principles tend to discover new revenue streams, reduce operational and regulatory risks, and build more resilient business models. Adopting a more holistic perspective to business does not represent a trade-off between profit and purpose;, but a more sophisticated understanding of how meaningful benefits can be generated and scaled. Done deliberately it is a win-win-win-win for the people we are, the institutions we are part of, the countries we belong to and the planet we depend on.\nScaling Impact: The Institutional Imperative\nA transition to mainstream prosocial AI requires more than individual company initiatives; it demands systemic change. Universities, industry associations, and regulatory bodies must collaborate to create an environment where quadruple bottom line thinking becomes the norm. Programs like Wharton's executive education courses on responsible AI exemplify this approach, coupling technical proficiency with ethical reasoning.\nThe Quadruple Bottom Line: The FOUR Framework\nTo move from concept to reality, organizations can use the practical FOUR framework:\nF - Focus on Stakeholder Integration: Identify all stakeholders\u2014employees, customers, communities, and environmental systems\u2014and incorporate their perspectives into AI development.\nO - Optimize for Multiple Variables: Redesign success metrics to include social and environmental indicators alongside financial ones.\nU - Understand Through Measurement: Invest in robust systems to track social and environmental impact with the same rigor as traditional business metrics.\nR - Reflect and Adapt Continuously: Implement regular review processes to assess the real-world impact of ProSocial AI initiatives and create feedback loops for continuous improvement.\nA Call For Bottomline Intentionality\nThe quadruple bottom line is a strategic necessity for businesses seeking to thrive in an increasingly hybrid and ever more interconnected world. As consumers, employees, and investors increasingly demand purpose-driven organizations, companies that master this integration will not just be doing good, but doing exceptionally well.\nMaking the switch from purely pro-profit to a 4P-perspective makes businesses future-proof. It actually adds an additional \u201cP\u201d - with prepared leadership as stressed by Wooten and James. Business schools can be champions of such an integrated approach, with examples like the Wharton AI Human Research Lab and the Wharton Accountable AI Lab which look at the intersection of intelligent technology, business strategy and human behavior, while addressing AI's ethical, regulatory and governance considerations.\nThe transition will be gradual, driven by a combination of regulatory pressure, consumer demand and proven competitive advantage. Ultimately the future belongs to organizations that recognize technology\u2019s power to amplify human potential, strengthen communities and nurture the planet. In this future, the quadruple bottom line is not just a measurement framework. It is a pathway to shared prosperity. It\u2019s time to start walking, prosocial AI can accelerate our pace."

This singular focus on AI literacy misses a deeper truth: the real competitive edge in our algorithmic future won't come from understanding AI alone. It will emerge from cultivating double literacy, a fundamental fluency in both the artificial and critically, the human.\nOur collective fascination with technology has begun to further sideline the very human capacities that define our ingenuity, our ethics and our ability to truly innovate. The current drive for AI literacy is a useful step, but it must be paired with an equally deliberate cultivation of human literacy. Without dual mastery, people and businesses risk not just inefficiency, but medium term mediocrity due to the erosion of nuanced judgment, compassion and creative sparks that only human beings can provide (so far at least).\nBeyond Prompts: What Is Double Literacy?\nDouble Literacy is not another buzzword; it's a strategic multigenerational investment for the modern enterprise. It encompasses two interconnected pillars:\nAlgorithmic Literacy: This is the essential understanding of how AI actually functions. It moves beyond simply knowing how to use an AI tool to grasp its underlying logic, its inherent biases, its limitations, and its optimal applications. It means recognizing when an AI is confident but wrong, when its data is skewed, or when a task truly requires human intuition over algorithmic calculation. This level of understanding is critical for effective interaction and responsible deployment.\nHuman Literacy: This involves a commitment to a continuous development and safeguarding of our uniquely human capacities. It's about sharpening critical thinking, fostering empathy, strengthening ethical reasoning, nurturing creativity and honing the ability to ask candid, open-ended questions that a large language model, by its very nature, cannot generate. It's the holistic understanding of self, others, and the intricate tapestry of society.\nWhy are both indispensable? Because the most powerful breakthroughs, the most resilient strategies, and the most impactful innovations arise from the seamless, conscious collaboration between these two distinct forms of intelligence.\nUnseen Frictions: Why We Need Double Literacy, Now\nThe best time to invest in Double Literacy was yesterday, the next best time is now.. This is driven by several converging forces:\n- The Paradox of Unconscious Collaboration: Recent Gallup research paints a telling picture: while algorithmic tool adoption has surged (a 12-point increase in white-collar roles since 2024), employee preparedness to work with AI has declined from 2024 to 2025. This growing disconnect signals an \"unconscious collaboration\" where AI integration outpaces our human and cultural adaptation. We are using AI, but not always with full awareness or optimal engagement.\n- The Cognitive Offloading Dilemma: Our natural tendency to delegate mental tasks to external systems, known as cognitive offloading, is accelerating. While AI can significantly boost productivity and quality, as highlighted by recent Harvard Business School research, it can also subtly erode our critical thinking skills if we bypass essential mental effort. The challenge lies in achieving \"appropriate reliance\"\u2014a finely tuned trust that allows humans and machines to collaborate effectively without sacrificing human cognitive autonomy.\n- The Mandate for Transparency: The European Union's AI Act, effective August 1, 2024, underscores the global shift towards transparency in AI. Its emphasis on users' understanding when they interact with AI systems reflects a cultural commitment to conscious engagement, demanding that businesses cultivate both algorithmic understanding and human oversight.\n- Misleading Trust: Data reveals a frightening pattern: studies suggest AI use may reduce critical thinking skills, particularly among younger, more frequent users. This highlights the urgent need to nurture conscious engagement, not just passive adoption. This dynamic plays out to another phenomenon whereby the more humans trust the AI the less they verify its outputs \u2013 and the more they trust the artificial intelligence the less they rely on their own judgement and thinking.\nA Promise: Hybrid Intelligence To Amplify Potential\nThe true promise of AI lies not in replacing natural intelligence, but in amplifying and diversifying it. This is the core of hybrid intelligence, where human-in-the-loop collaboration and cognitive computing merge. When humans possess strong algorithmic literacy, they can effectively leverage AI's analytical power, speed, and pattern recognition. When they also possess strong human literacy, they can provide the essential context, ethical discernment, empathy, and creative vision that AI lacks.\nThis symbiosis leads to a new chapter of potential. Imagine medical researchers using AI for rapid diagnostic imaging, while human experts provide the context relevant judgment for life-critical decisions. Or jazz musicians collaborating with generative AI to explore harmonic possibilities, with human artistry guiding the algorithm toward emotionally resonant compositions. As research on human-machine collaboration indicates, insights from cognitive psychology can help educators and trainers utilize AI tools to facilitate learning, enhancing human cognitive processes rather than replacing them. The outcome is not just efficiency, but breakthroughs that neither human nor machine could achieve alone.\nPractical Takeaways: RISE By With Double Literacy\nFor business leaders ready to proactively cultivate Double Literacy within their organizations, the RISE framework offers a tangible starting point:\n- Reframe: Shift the organizational mindset from viewing AI as merely a tool for automation to recognizing it as a genuine cognitive partner. This reframing is essential for fostering a culture of conscious collaboration. Encourage teams to explore how AI can augment their unique human skills, rather than fearing displacement.\n- Invest: Prioritize investment in both algorithmic and human literacy. This means providing training not only on AI tools and their technical aspects but also on critical thinking, ethical reasoning, emotional intelligence, and complex problem-solving. Consider cross-disciplinary workshops where technologists and humanists learn from each other.\n- Scrutinize: Implement processes that encourage intelligent skepticism. Teach employees to critically evaluate AI outputs, question assumptions, and understand the provenance of data. Foster a culture where challenging algorithmic recommendations is seen as a strength, leading to more robust and ethical outcomes. This includes transparent internal guidelines for AI use.\n- Empower: Design workflows and organizational structures that empower humans to retain agency and ethical oversight in AI-driven processes. Ensure that AI serves human flourishing, not the other way around. Empower teams to experiment responsibly with AI, learn from failures, and adapt their approaches based on real-world feedback and human values.\nThe future of innovation belongs to those who master the delicate, powerful dance between human and artificial intelligence. By deliberately cultivating Double Literacy, businesses can not only navigate the algorithmic age but lead it, ensuring that technology amplifies our humanity, rather than diminishing it."

      "text": "The recently concluded ASEAN AI Malaysia Summit 2025 was more than a conference. It was a deliberate assertion of technological self-determination, designed to resonate beyond Southeast Asia. Sovereignty of artificial intelligence as cultural preservation \u2013 another AI revolution in the making?\nThe Incomplete Triangle Of AI Supremacy\nThe main story people tell about AI has boiled down to a narrow view that treats it mostly as a geopolitical competition: Washington versus Beijing versus Europe, capitalism versus authoritarian control versus consumer orientation. In this dynamic the so-called Global South is often relegated to passive consumption of technologies designed in Western boardrooms, deployed from US-based corporations, trained on English language and culture. This thinking \u2014 amplified by extensive 24/7 hybrid media coverage and heated venture capital echo chambers \u2014 obscures a more nuanced transformation occurring at the periphery of traditional power structures.\nMalaysia is participating in the accelerating AI discourse, and it is beginning to rewrite the terms of engagement.\nWhat emerges from Kuala Lumpur is neither imitation nor opposition, but a coherent alternative \u2013 which challenges the foundational assumptions of AI development itself. This is not about catching up with existing paradigms, but about creating new ones \u2014 a post-colonial reimagining of what artificial intelligence can become if it can be freed from the extractive logic of platform capitalism and rather be guided by a deliberate intent to maximise values and social benefits.\nDigital Sovereignty As Epistemic Independence\nLaunched yesterday Malaysia\u2019s National Cloud Computing Policy is a prime example of this approach. More than mere infrastructure policy, it represents what postcolonial theorists might call epistemic disobedience \u2014 the rejection of technological dependence as natural or inevitable. By mandating data sovereignty and creating indigenous cloud infrastructure, Malaysia is operationalizing technology designed by and for specific cultural contexts, not imposed from above.\nThe projected US$26.18 billion (RM110 billion) in economic impact by 2028 is significant, but the strategic implications are revolutionary: it is proof that economic development need not require digital colonization.\nThe Ilmu Paradigm: Language As Liberation Technology\nThe unveiling of Ilmu on August 12th \u2014 Malaysia's first indigenous multimodal AI model embodies a challenge to AI universalism. Developed through the partnership between YTL AI Labs and Universiti Malaya, Ilmu demonstrates that linguistic diversity is not a market inefficiency to be optimized away, but a source of algorithmic advantage.\nThis matters because language models encode worldviews. When AI systems are trained exclusively on English-dominant datasets, they embed particular ways of understanding reality, hence a coloniality of knowledge weaves past mindsets and values into future algorithms. Ilmu's focus on Bahasa Melayu (Malaysian language) and local dialects is thus both an act of cognitive sovereignty, ensuring that Malaysian AI reflects Malaysian \u201cways of knowing\u201d. At the same time it is a pragmatic path to ensure that Ilmu is configured to give the best possible answers to its proprietary customers: Malaysian individuals and institutions.\nThe collaboration with DeepSeek's open-source LLM amplifies this. By becoming the first nation to deploy open-source LLMs at scale, Malaysia has chosen interoperability over dependency, commons over enclosure. The resulting innovations \u2014 including NurAI, the world's first Shariah-compliant AI chatbot \u2014 demonstrate how technological sovereignty enables cultural specificity rather than constraining it.\nProsocial AI: Economics Of Post-Extractivism\nMalaysia's approach crystallizes the logic of prosocial AI \u2014 AI systems that are tailored, trained, tested, and targeted to bring out the best in and for people and planet. This is not a pretense of corporate social responsibility nor algorithmic greenwashing, but a deliberate reorientation of technological purpose. Beyond Silicon Valley\u2019s \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d moto, and Sam Altman\u2019s belief that \u201ctechnology happens because it it possible\u201d \u2013 the 4T framework of prosocial AI offers a more maturation and meaningful roadmap to not only navigate, but shape the hybrid future. .\nThe underpinning logic addresses the core challenge of our time: operating within planetary boundaries while meeting human needs. Prosocial AI offers a pathway beyond the false choice between growth and sustainability by recognizing that long-term value creation requires embedding social and environmental considerations into the very architecture of technological systems.\nRather than treating ethical considerations as constraints, Malaysia has begun to find ways to harness them as competitive advantages. Trust becomes a strategic asset, cultural relevance generates market differentiation and environmental consciousness to open new revenue streams. This is capitalism with different parameters \u2014 a form of diverse economies 4.0.\nClimate-Conscious AI: Technology As A Tipping Element\nMalaysia\u2019s emerging AI strategy comes at a painful juncture in planetary history. Scientists have flagged several ecological tipping points \u2013 critical thresholds in the Earth's climate system where a small change can trigger a significant and often irreversible, shift in the system's state. Coming on top and potentially influencing all of them, comes technology as a catalyst that is capable of cascading large-scale transformation for good, or very bad.\nThe urgency cannot be overstated. Current trajectories point toward multiple simultaneous crises: climate breakdown, biodiversity collapse, and social fragmentation. In this context, AI represents both risk and opportunity. Deployed carelessly, AI systems will trigger an ABCD of AI-issues - degrading human agency, fragilizing interpersonal bonds, amplifying resource consumption and accelerating social stratification. Deployed consciously, they offer the opportunity to empower humans as agents of change, optimize resource flows, accelerate renewable energy transitions and help coordinate collective action at previously impossible scales.\nMalaysia's take on developing an AI framework suggests that technology could become a positive element in the planetary health equation \u2013 if regenerative intent were to be embedded into its algorithmic architecture. Future AI systems could be designed not merely to minimize environmental harm, but to actively contribute to ecological restoration.\nBecause a climate-conscious AI approach not only acknowledges that technological transition must occur but acts on it. It's a smart choice.\nAs climate breakdown accelerates and social inequality deepens, the question is not whether AI will reshape society, but whether that reshaping will kill or cultivate human flourishing within planetary boundaries. A true AI revolution is not about more powered technology, but the regenerative human intent that drives it."

      "text": "Some still consider artificial intelligence as just another tool like Excel in accounting. But maybe it's time to acknowledge that the current transition is more complex than previous technologies.\nThe evolving interplay between AI and NI - Natural Intelligence transcends simple tool use. It is reshaping the essence of our human experience. The intensifying interaction between our minds and their artificial counterparts increasingly influences the four foundational dimensions of human life: aspirations, emotions, thoughts, and sensations/behavior. When managed thoughtfully, this dynamic can foster a virtuous cycle, leading to mutual enhancement and elevating human potential and well-being. But this positive impact will not manifest automatically.\nUnderstanding the risks and potential of the symbiotic relationship that is in the making as we read/write is paramount as AI increasingly infiltrates our lives, influencing everything from information processing to our perception of reality. Let\u2019s take a step back and adopt the POZE paradigm, a multidimensional framework to human experience.\nA Multidimensional Understanding Of Life\nHuman existence is an organically evolving kaleidoscope that arises from 4 interconnected dimensions, each indispensable for a complete experience. Our thoughts govern our understanding, reasoning, and problem-solving, forming the basis of our cognitive world. Emotions provide the affective layer, coloring our experiences, driving our reactions, and connecting us deeply to others and our environment. Our aspirations represent our future-oriented self, encompassing our goals, hopes, and ambitions that provide purpose and direction. Finally, sensations and behavior are our direct engagement with the physical world, how we perceive it, and how we act within it. These dimensions are not isolated; they constantly influence one another, creating a holistic human experience. AI, with its all pervasive reach into information, communication, and automation, inherently interacts with and impacts each of these core aspects of what it means to be human.\nAt the core of this interaction is a feedback loop where AI, developed by natural intelligence and trained on human-generated data, is designed to augment or replicate human capabilities. Subsequently, AI influences human behavior, cognition, and internal states, generating new data and possibilities for further AI development. This continuous cycle holds the potential to significantly enhance human capabilities and experiences.\nAspirations: Unlocking Potential\nAI can thus serve as a potent catalyst for achieving our aspirations. It possesses the capacity to automate tedious tasks, extract profound insights from extensive datasets and open new avenues for creative expression. Furthermore, AI can personalize learning and development, empowering individuals to pursue their objectives more effectively. AI tools are accelerating discoveries in scientific research and generating novel ideas and content within creative industries. Used deliberately, AI can amplify human agency and unlock new levels of creativity and productivity. This establishes a virtuous cycle where AI empowers individuals to accomplish more, fostering higher aspirations and driving further innovation in AI itself. But it might as well become an insidious factor that takes us along the scale of agency decay, without us even noticing it until it is too late.\nEmotions: Enhancing Well-being Through Support\nThe impact of AI on human emotions is multifaceted, offering pathways to enhanced well-being. AI-powered systems can analyze emotional states through facial recognition, voice analysis and text sentiment, potentially offering personalized support and tailoring interactions. In this context the development of AI companions and chatbots aims to provide emotional assistance. While AI can generate responses that make individuals feel heard, the perception of whether the response originates from a human or AI affects emotional resonance. AI can help people feel heard, but an AI label diminishes this impact. On the other hand AI might actually outperform humans in defusing emotionally charged situations, highlighting its potential in specific contexts. This can lead to a virtuous cycle where AI provides timely support and understanding, thereby enhancing emotional well-being. The acceleration of artificial emotional intelligence development underscores its potential for therapeutic applications. Regardless of the positive potential, humans are quirky and cumbersome \u2013 and there is an acute risk of dependency on bots, where humans replace interpersonal relationships with the convenience of artificial companions.\nThoughts: Augmenting Cognitive Abilities\nThe domain of human thought is where the AI/NI cycle often demonstrates its most immediate effects. Generative AI is reshaping how we interact with information, learning, reasoning and making decisions. AI can function as a powerful instrument for critical thinking, offering access to diverse perspectives and analyzing complex data. Collaborative problem-solving between humans and AI has shown to outperform either entity working independently, especially in tasks requiring both data analysis and human judgment. AI reshapes our mental landscape. This dynamic can trigger a virtuous cycle where AI boosts our abilities, leading to deeper understanding and more effective problem-solving. But it might as well lead to cognitive crutches where memorization, writing and critical thinking are offloaded to external assistants.\nSensations And Behavior: Optimizing Our Interaction With The World\nAI influences our sensations and behavior through intuitive interfaces, personalized recommendations and fine tuned automation. From tailored content feeds catering to individual preferences to autonomous systems performing physical tasks, AI increasingly mediates our engagement with the hybrid world. These systems can analyze behavioral patterns to predict actions or customize experiences, potentially leading to more efficient and engaging interactions. It can enhance user satisfaction and engagement through more intuitive and personalized experiences and expressions more joyful and fulfilling. Or it could make us numb, dependent and enthralled in a never ending quest for meaning in an online world.\nThe interplay across these dimensions forms interconnected cycles. It depends on our own choices whether the turn of these cycles is in favor of our being or not. For instance, leveraging AI tools to enhance critical thinking and creativity (a virtuous cognitive cycle) can lead to the pursuit of more ambitious goals (a virtuous aspirational cycle), fostering positive emotions and more engaged behaviors. By consciously navigating this expanding landscape, we can ensure AI serves as a tool to enrich experiences, rather than depleting our ability to think, feel and aspire as autonomous agents in our own life.\nA Path To Hybrid Intelligence\nAnchored in the 4 dimensions, the A-Frame offers a practical way to curate agency amid AI which requires Hybrid intelligence from the inside out:\nAwareness - Be deliberate in your interaction with generative AI. When do you use it and why.\nAppreciation - Acknowledge the unique attributions that both NI and AI have in your life; and the value of their complementarity.\nAcceptance - Be conscious of the limitations that both, NI and AI have.\nAccountability - Recognize that you remain responsible for the outcomes of whatever results from the interplay of AI and NI.\nLets starting curating today."

      "text": "How satellites, algorithms and AI can help map and trace methane sources\nEvery year, our planet gets hotter because of greenhouse gas pollution. In fact, 2023 was the hottest year on record, and the last ten years have been the hottest years since 1850. Reducing this warming is essential to decreasing the risk of wildfires, drought and other extreme environmental events, and results in cleaner air and healthier communities. Today, we\u2019re announcing a partnership with Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) that combines our science and technology to reduce methane emissions. This is one of the most powerful, short-term actions we can take to reduce warming.\nMethane from human sources is responsible for about 30% of global warming today, and a big contributor of methane in the atmosphere comes from extracting fossil fuels, like oil and gas, from the Earth. By powering methane detection algorithms with Cloud computing and applying AI to satellite imagery to identify oil and gas infrastructure around the world, our goal is to help EDF quantify and trace methane emissions to their source. With this information, energy companies, researchers and the public sector can take action to reduce emissions from oil and gas infrastructure faster and more effectively.\nHow satellites will help us spot methane from space\nEDF\u2019s new satellite, MethaneSAT, will map, measure and track methane with unprecedented precision, offering a comprehensive view of methane emissions. Launching in early March on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, MethaneSAT will orbit the Earth 15 times a day at an altitude of over 350 miles. It will measure methane levels in the top oil and gas regions in the world for regular analysis. MethaneSAT is highly sophisticated; it has a unique ability to monitor both high-emitting methane sources and small sources spread over a wide area. To calculate the amount of methane emitted in specific places and track those emissions over time, EDF developed algorithms powered by Google Cloud in collaboration with scientists at Harvard University's School of Engineering and Applied Science and its Center for Astrophysics, and scientists at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.\nEDF\u2019s aerial data, available in Earth Engine, shows both high-emitting point sources as yellow dots, and diffuse area sources as a purple and yellow heat map. MethaneSAT will collect this data with the same technology, at a global scale and with more frequency.\nMapping methane leaks\nIn addition to detecting emissions, we\u2019re taking it a step further and creating a global map of oil and gas infrastructure, with the goal of understanding which components contribute most to emissions. Just like how we use AI to detect sidewalks, street signs and road names in satellite imagery to display helpful information in Google Maps, we\u2019ll also use AI to identify oil and gas infrastructure, like oil storage containers, in our imagery. Then, we\u2019ll combine it with EDF\u2019s information about oil and gas infrastructure to locate where the emissions are coming from.\nThe top satellite image shows a map of dots, which are correctly identified as oil well pads. Using our satellite and aerial imagery, we applied AI to detect infrastructure components. Well pads are shown in yellow, oil pump jacks are shown in red, and storage tanks are shown in blue.\nOnce we have this complete infrastructure map, we can overlay the MethaneSAT data that shows where methane is coming from. When the two maps are lined up, we can see how emissions correspond to specific infrastructure and obtain a far better understanding of the types of sources that generally contribute most to methane leaks. This information is incredibly valuable to anticipate and mitigate emissions in oil and gas infrastructure that is generally most susceptible to leaks.\nHow companies can use this information to take action\nTo help researchers and organizations, these insights will be available later this year on MethaneSAT\u2019s website and accessible through Google Earth Engine, our planetary-scale environmental monitoring platform. By making MethaneSAT datasets available on Earth Engine, which has over 100,000 monthly active users, it\u2019s easier for users to detect trends and understand correlations between human activities and environmental impact. For example, Earth Engine users can combine methane data with other datasets \u2014 like land cover, forests, water, ecosystems, regional borders and more \u2014 to do things like track methane emissions in a given area over time. Explore the aerial data or access it for analysis in Earth Engine.\nEarth Engine users can combine methane data with other datasets.\nFiguring out how to address methane emissions is one of the biggest climate challenges we face today. We\u2019re excited to share actionable information that is urgently needed to achieve real impact. This work is possible thanks to our partners at EDF."

As the mass of larger debris \u2013 including containers, bottle caps, crates and old fishing gear \u2013 continues to degrade over time, the quantity of microplastics could increase significantly. This is an urgent environmental problem garnering much attention around the world.\nAlthough plastic recycling plays a comparatively smaller role when it comes to emission reductions, improved waste management infrastructure \u2013 a necessary pre-requisite for the recycling increases in the CTS \u2013 lays the groundwork to drastically reduce plastic pollution from today\u2019s unacceptable levels.

      "text": "Machine learning can boost the value of wind energy\nCarbon-free technologies like renewable energy help combat climate change, but many of them have not reached their full potential. Consider wind power: over the past decade, wind farms have become an important source of carbon-free electricity as the cost of turbines has plummeted and adoption has surged. However, the variable nature of wind itself makes it an unpredictable energy source\u2014less useful than one that can reliably deliver power at a set time.\nIn search of a solution to this problem, last year, DeepMind and Google started applying machine learning algorithms to 700 megawatts of wind power capacity in the central United States. These wind farms\u2014part of Google\u2019s global fleet of renewable energy projects\u2014collectively generate as much electricity as is needed by a medium-sized city.\nUsing a neural network trained on widely available weather forecasts and historical turbine data, we configured the DeepMind system to predict wind power output 36 hours ahead of actual generation. Based on these predictions, our model recommends how to make optimal hourly delivery commitments to the power grid a full day in advance. This is important, because energy sources that can be scheduled (i.e. can deliver a set amount of electricity at a set time) are often more valuable to the grid.\nAlthough we continue to refine our algorithm, our use of machine learning across our wind farms has produced positive results. To date, machine learning has boosted the value of our wind energy by roughly 20 percent, compared to the baseline scenario of no time-based commitments to the grid.\nWe can\u2019t eliminate the variability of the wind, but our early results suggest that we can use machine learning to make wind power sufficiently more predictable and valuable. This approach also helps bring greater data rigor to wind farm operations, as machine learning can help wind farm operators make smarter, faster and more data-driven assessments of how their power output can meet electricity demand.\nResults from DeepMind application of machine learning to Google\u2019s wind power\nOur hope is that this kind of machine learning approach can strengthen the business case for wind power and drive further adoption of carbon-free energy on electric grids worldwide. Researchers and practitioners across the energy industry are developing novel ideas for how society can make the most of variable power sources like solar and wind. We\u2019re eager to join them in exploring general availability of these cloud-based machine learning strategies.\nGoogle recently achieved 100 percent renewable energy purchasing and is now striving to source carbon-free energy on a 24x7 basis. The partnership with DeepMind to make wind power more predictable and valuable is a concrete step toward that aspiration. While much remains to be done, this step is a meaningful one\u2014for Google, and more importantly, for the environment."

      "text": "We have come to a remarkable moment in human history. On one side, artificial intelligence promises to revolutionize how we understand and interact among each other and with our environment. On the other, we face what scientists call the \"Great Acceleration\", a period where human activity has pushed six of nine planetary boundaries beyond safe limits, including climate change, biodiversity loss and biogeochemical flows, threatening the very foundations of life on Earth.\nBut what if these two realities aren't opposing forces? What if AI, guided by the right human intentions, could help us write a new chapter where technology and nature exist in harmony rather than conflict?\nThe Planetary Health Imperative\nA recent commentary in The Lancet makes a compelling case for connecting planetary boundaries with planetary health, the understanding that human wellbeing depends entirely on Earth's natural systems. The authors argue that destabilizing our planet's life-support systems fundamentally threatens human health in ways we're only beginning to understand, with health impacts occurring even before planetary boundaries are transgressed.\nFour cornerstones are proposed for integration: recognizing that Earth system destabilization threatens human health, centering justice for vulnerable populations, accounting for true costs and benefits of environmental policies, and developing integrated science communication to build broader support for change. Critically, each planetary boundary requires comprehensive health risk assessment, something that demands permanent platforms for transdisciplinary collaboration between Earth system scientists, health researchers and affected communities.\nConsider the interconnected web, much like the World Wide Web itself, where each strand is linked to another: climate change affects food security, which influences migration patterns, and in turn, impacts mental health and social stability. Novel chemicals alter hormone systems, while biodiversity loss weakens nature\u2019s ability to regulate diseases. Ocean acidification threatens protein sources for billions. Each boundary crossed sends a ripple through this vast, complex system, much like how a single change on one webpage can ripple across the entire internet.\nWithin this reality lies an opportunity. The very systems thinking that allows us to trace these connections also points toward solutions. This is where AI's potential becomes truly interesting \u2014 it functions as the network\u2019s protocol, capable of navigating and optimizing these connections, finding solutions faster and more efficiently \u2013 and helping us restore balance to the web that sustains us.\nMinds Behind Machines\nThe neuralgic feature is that AI is not neutral. It amplifies human values, priorities and ways of thinking. If humankind continues to allow the approach to AI development to be dominated by extractive mindsets, viewing nature as a resource to be optimized and controlled, we'll create systems that perpetuate our current trajectory toward planetary collapse.\nBut if we can find the way to make a conscious effort to ground AI development in what Indigenous wisdom has long understood; that human and planetary health are inseparable, we open possibilities for genuinely transformative technology.\nThis shift requires what the Lancet commentary calls \"overcoming the root causes of the intertwined environmental, health, and justice crises\" by \"changing the mindsets that created them and embracing the interconnectedness of all people and nature.\"\nAI As Nature's Ally\nImagine AI systems designed with this ecological wisdom at their core. Instead of maximizing short-term profits, they could optimize for long-term planetary health. Instead of treating symptoms, they could address root causes of environmental degradation.\nWe're already seeing glimpses of this potential. AI is helping restore degraded ecosystems by analyzing satellite imagery to identify optimal reforestation sites. It's revolutionizing agriculture by enabling precision farming that uses fewer resources while maintaining yields. Climate models powered by machine learning are providing surprising insights into Earth system dynamics.\nBut the real transformation can happen only when we scale this thinking and recognize the co-benefits that emerge when we align technology with planetary health. The Lancet commentary emphasizes that policies to mitigate Earth system destabilization often have immediate and long-term health benefits, making them more compelling and cost-efficient. Picture AI systems that can:\n- Build circular economy networks, where waste is eliminated because one industry\u2019s leftovers are used by another.\n- Design cities to work like nature, where energy, water, and materials are reused in closed loops\n- Help countries to work together on climate action by showing win-win solutions for environmental and human health.\n- Create permanent platforms where scientists, health experts, and communities can work together to tackle planetary health risks.\n- Make environmental data and decision-making tools open and accessible so local communities can better protect nature.\nThe Shadow Side We Cannot Ignore\nStill \u2013 we must also confront the paradox of using AI to support planetary health: AI's current trajectory is accelerating the very problems it could help solve. Data centers accounted for roughly 1.5% of global electricity consumption in 2024, and this amount is expected to double by 2030 because of AI use.\nThe numbers are staggering. AI-specific servers in data centers are estimated to have used between 53 and 76 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2024, enough to power more than 7.2 million US homes for a year. Water consumption is equally concerning: Google's water consumption jumped 20% in 2024, while data centers in the United States use about 7,100 liters of water for each megawatt-hour of energy they consume \u2013 that\u2019s enough to run 70 loads of laundry in an average washing machine\nThe land footprint is expanding rapidly too. Companies have leased nearly 3 gigawatts of data-center capacity in North America in the first half of 2024, which is up from 1.4 gigawatts in the first half of 2023. Combined investments from Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, and Apple alone will exceed $450 billion in 2025. Types of energy production that had been discontinued in many places, from coal to nuclear energy are being brought back to satisfy the gigantic energy appetite of our growing artificial treasure chest.\nThis isn't sustainable. If we continue on this path, AI will become a major driver of environmental degradation rather than a solution to it. And here we have answers already. We urgently need to steer AI development deliberately, not only toward efficiency but people and planet-oriented responsibility. This means investing in renewable energy to power data centers, building AI models that require less energy and water, and enforcing stricter corporate environmental performance standards that preserve livelihoods and ecosystems. ProSocial AI is proplanetary AI and vice-versa.\nBut none of this will happen without serious governance reforms. Governments, regulators, and international bodies must step in to set clear environmental limits on AI development and hold tech companies accountable. With the right rules and incentives in place, AI can reduce its own footprint while accelerating solutions for planetary health\u2014instead of becoming a driver of further harm.\nThe Justice Imperative\nJustice is central to the planetary health approach. Environmental changes impact everyone, but they disproportionately weigh on future generations, Indigenous peoples and already marginalized communities. Differently put \u2013 those who contributed least to the problems are the ones who bear the biggest burden. It is time to address this lack of justice \u2013 and absence of logic.\nThe same lack of fairness applies to AI development. We cannot create prosocial AI \u2013 AI systems that are tailored, trained, tested and targeted to bring out the best in and for people and planet, without including the voices and needs of those most affected by both environmental degradation and technological change. This means involving diverse communities in AI governance, ensuring equitable access to AI benefits and designing systems that strengthen rather than undermine local autonomy and traditional knowledge.\nA Planetary Framework For Transformation\nMoving forward requires a holistic understanding of humanity\u2019s relationship with nature, and the planet. It is time for a large-scale approach to cultivate individual and institutional understanding of what's at stake \u2013 and mobilize action. In this endeavor we also need a new narrative that positions AI not as humanity's replacement but as our partner in planetary healing.\nThe path forward can be summarized in the acronym PLANET:\nPrioritize regenerative design, Build AI systems that restore rather than deplete natural systems, starting with dramatically reducing the energy and resource footprint of AI infrastructure itself.\nLead with justice, Center equity and community voice in AI development, ensuring that technological solutions strengthen rather than undermine local autonomy and traditional knowledge.\nAlign with nature's wisdom, Design AI systems that mimic natural processes: circular, adaptive, resilient, and focused on long-term stability rather than short-term optimization.\nNavigate complexity, Use AI's pattern recognition capabilities to understand and work with Earth's interconnected systems rather than trying to control them.\nEngage communities, Make AI development a participatory process that includes diverse voices, especially those most affected by environmental and technological change.\nTransform systems, Use AI to enable fundamental shifts in how we organize food, energy, transportation and economic systems around planetary health principles.\nThe Triple Promise Of Prosocial AI\nWe stand at a threshold where AI could become humanity's most loyal ally in planetary healing, but only if we understand what \"prosocial AI\" truly means. It's not just about making AI more helpful or ethical. It's about creating technology that is simultaneously pro-people, pro-planet, and pro-potential.\nPro-people means AI that strengthens communities rather than displacing them, that amplifies human wisdom rather than replacing it, and that ensures the benefits of technological advancement flow to those who need them most, not just those who can afford them.\nPro-planet means AI systems designed within ecological limits, that regenerate rather than degrade natural systems, and that treat Earth's boundaries not as constraints to overcome but as the fundamental parameters for sustainable innovation.\nPro-potential means AI that unlocks humanity's capacity for collective intelligence, creativity, and cooperation \u2014 helping us imagine and build futures we couldn't create alone.\nA commitment to prosocial AI could awaken our collective potential as Earth's conscious participants rather than its unconscious destroyers.\nA Regenerative Future Awaits\nImagine waking up fifty years from now in a world where AI has helped deliver the greatest regeneration in human history. Cities breathe like forests. Oceans teem with life. The climate has stabilized. Communities thrive in diversity and dignity. Technology serves life, not the other way around.\nThis isn't utopian fantasy \u2014 it's entirely possible with the tools we have today, guided by the wisdom we've always had. The question isn't whether we can build this future, but whether we'll choose to.\nEvery line of code written, every algorithm trained, every AI system deployed is a vote for the kind of world we want to create. We can continue down the path of extraction and acceleration, or we can choose regeneration and wisdom.\nThe Earth is waiting. The technology is ready. The only question left is: are we?\nThe future isn't something that happens to us \u2014 it's something we co-create, one choice after another. And right now, we have the chance to get it right.\nNot just for the planet. Not just for people. But for the boundless potential that emerges when technology and nature move together in planetary harmony."
