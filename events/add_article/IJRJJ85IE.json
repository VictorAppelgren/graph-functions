      "summary": "Bill Bengen has revised the 4% retirement withdrawal rule to 4.7% after expanding his portfolio to seven asset classes and benefiting from strong equity returns, moving from a 50/50 stock‑bond mix to 55% stocks, 40% bonds, and 5% cash. The change reflects a shift toward a more aggressive allocation and acknowledges that the original rule was conservative for modern investors. The article also covers other market news, including the launch of “Trump Accounts” that give newborns a $1,000 tax‑advantaged deposit, rising concerns about Social Security depletion by 2034, fast‑food price hikes and declining breakfast sales, and the impact of higher interest rates on retail bankruptcies.",
