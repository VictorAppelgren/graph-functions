      "summary": "The U.S. has ended the de minimis tax loophole, meaning all online orders valued at $800 or less will now face tariffs, raising consumer costs and potentially slowing delivery times. The move, announced by President Trump, aims to curb illicit drug shipments and level the playing field for domestic retailers, with industry groups praising the action. The policy will generate an estimated $10 billion in annual tariff revenue and includes a six‑month transition period for postal carriers to adjust duty calculations.",
