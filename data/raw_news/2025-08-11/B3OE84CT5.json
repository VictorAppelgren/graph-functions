  "content": "Shares of cannabis company Tilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) jumped 38.5% in the afternoon session after reports that President Donald Trump is considering reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug, a move that could transform the cannabis industry's regulatory landscape. \n\n\n\nThe potential move, first reported by The Wall Street Journal and later confirmed by President Trump, would reclassify marijuana from its current status as a Schedule I substance, easing federal restrictions on the industry. At a press conference, the President stated he is \u201clooking at reclassification\u201d and will make a determination \u201cover the next few weeks.\u201d For cannabis companies, this change could be a game-changer. A key benefit would be relief from Internal Revenue Code Section 280E, which currently prohibits companies dealing with Schedule I substances from taking normal business deductions. This tax relief would significantly improve profitability. The optimism spread across the sector, with peers like Canopy Growth and Cronos Group also seeing their shares surge, reflecting broad investor hope for federal reforms.\n\nAfter the initial pop the shares cooled down and closed the day at $0.92, up 41.8% from previous close.\n\nIs now the time to buy Tilray? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nWhat Is The Market Telling Us\n\nTilray\u2019s shares are extremely volatile and have had 59 moves greater than 5% over the last year. But moves this big are rare even for Tilray and indicate this news significantly impacted the market\u2019s perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 4 days ago when the stock gained 4.9% on the news that the company announced the launch of its new Humble Seed Whole Wheat Protein Crackers, now available at Whole Foods Market. This move marked a notable expansion of the company's wellness product offerings into a major retail chain. The positive sentiment also followed other recent events. Earlier in the week, an analyst upgraded the stock to a \"Buy\" rating, and at the end of July, CEO Irwin D. Simon purchased 165,000 shares. This insider purchase signaled strong confidence in the company's direction.\n\nTilray is down 34.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $0.96 per share, it is trading 50.8% below its 52-week high of $1.95 from August 2024.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we\u2019ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefiting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.",

      "text": "Tilray (TLRY)\nWe wouldn\u2019t recommend Tilray. Its poor sales growth shows demand is soft and its negative returns on capital suggest it destroyed value.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think Tilray Will Underperform\nFounded in 2013, Tilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) engages in cannabis research, cultivation, and distribution, offering a range of medical and recreational cannabis products, hemp-based foods, and alcoholic beverages.\n- Historical operating margin losses have deepened over the last year, hinting at increased competitive pressures and an inefficient cost structure\n- Cash burn has widened over the last year, making us question whether it can reliably generate shareholder value\n- Negative returns on capital show that some of its growth strategies have backfired, and its decreasing returns suggest its historical profit centers are aging\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Tilray\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than Tilray\nTilray is trading at $1.05 per share, or 12.8x forward EV-to-EBITDA. This multiple rich for the business quality. Not a great combination.\nWe\u2019d rather pay a premium for quality. Cheap stocks can look like a great deal at first glance, but they can be value traps. Less earnings power means more reliance on a re-rating to generate good returns; this can be an unlikely scenario for low-quality companies.\n3. Tilray (TLRY) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nCannabis company Tilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) fell short of the market\u2019s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, with sales falling 2.3% year on year to $224.5 million. Its GAAP loss of $1.30 per share was significantly below analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nTilray (TLRY) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $224.5 million vs analyst estimates of $229.2 million (2.3% year-on-year decline, 2% miss)\n- EPS (GAAP): -$1.30 vs analyst estimates of -$0.03 (significant miss largely due to $1.4 billion one-time impairment charge)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $27.64 million vs analyst estimates of $23.69 million (12.3% margin, 16.7% beat)\n- EBITDA guidance for the upcoming financial year 2026 is $67 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $71.84 million\n- Operating Margin: -643%, down from -7.2% in the same quarter last year largely due to $1.4 billion one-time impairment charge\n- Free Cash Flow was -$13.15 million, down from $28.34 million in the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $696.9 million\nCompany Overview\nFounded in 2013, Tilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) engages in cannabis research, cultivation, and distribution, offering a range of medical and recreational cannabis products, hemp-based foods, and alcoholic beverages.\nThe company operates across North America and Europe, serving medical patients, recreational consumers, and retail partners. Tilray generates revenue through product sales, brand partnerships, and licensing agreements.\n4. Beverages, Alcohol, and Tobacco\nThese companies' performance is influenced by brand strength, marketing strategies, and shifts in consumer preferences. Changing consumption patterns are particularly relevant and can be seen in the rise of cannabis, craft beer, and vaping or the steady decline of soda and cigarettes. Companies that spend on innovation to meet consumers where they are with regards to trends can reap huge demand benefits while those who ignore trends can see stagnant volumes. Finally, with the advent of the social media, the cost of starting a brand from scratch is much lower, meaning that new entrants can chip away at the market shares of established players.\nCompetitors in the cannabis industry include Aurora Cannabis (TSX:ACB) and Cronos Group (TSX:CRON). Tobacco companies like Altria (NYSE:MO) and British American Tobacco have made investments in the cannabis space, making them competitors as well.\n5. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years.\nWith $821.3 million in revenue over the past 12 months, Tilray is a small consumer staples company, which sometimes brings disadvantages compared to larger competitors benefiting from economies of scale and negotiating leverage with retailers. On the bright side, it can grow faster because it has a longer list of untapped store chains to sell into.\nAs you can see below, Tilray\u2019s sales grew at a decent 9.3% compounded annual growth rate over the last three years. This shows its offerings generated slightly more demand than the average consumer staples company, a useful starting point for our analysis.\nThis quarter, Tilray missed Wall Street\u2019s estimates and reported a rather uninspiring 2.3% year-on-year revenue decline, generating $224.5 million of revenue.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 6.3% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last three years. Despite the slowdown, this projection is above the sector average and indicates the market sees some success for its newer products.\n6. Gross Margin & Pricing Power\nAll else equal, we prefer higher gross margins because they usually indicate that a company sells more differentiated products, has a stronger brand, and commands pricing power.\nTilray\u2019s gross margin is slightly below the average consumer staples company, giving it less room to invest in areas such as marketing and talent to grow its brand. As you can see below, it averaged a 29.7% gross margin over the last two years. That means Tilray paid its suppliers a lot of money ($70.33 for every $100 in revenue) to run its business.\nTilray\u2019s gross profit margin came in at 30.1% this quarter, down 5.8 percentage points year on year and falling way short of analysts\u2019 estimates. Zooming out, the company\u2019s full-year margin has remained steady over the past 12 months, suggesting its input costs (such as raw materials and manufacturing expenses) have been stable and it isn\u2019t under pressure to lower prices.\n7. Operating Margin\nUnprofitable public companies are rare in the defensive consumer staples industry. Unfortunately, Tilray was one of them over the last two years as its high expenses contributed to an average operating margin of negative 153%.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, Tilray\u2019s operating margin decreased significantly over the last year. This raises questions about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. Tilray\u2019s performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows that costs were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass them onto its customers.\nIn Q2, Tilray generated a negative 643% operating margin largely due to $1.4 billion one-time impairment charge.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nWe track the change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\nIn Q2, Tilray reported EPS at negative $1.30, down from negative $0.04 in the same quarter last year largely due to $1.4 billion one-time impairment charge. This print missed analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street is optimistic. Analysts forecast Tilray\u2019s full-year EPS of negative $2.31 will reach break even.\n9. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nTilray\u2019s demanding reinvestments have drained its resources over the last two years, putting it in a pinch and limiting its ability to return capital to investors. Its free cash flow margin averaged negative 10.7%, meaning it lit $10.70 of cash on fire for every $100 in revenue.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Tilray\u2019s margin dropped by 8.1 percentage points over the last year. Almost any movement in the wrong direction is undesirable because it is already burning cash. If the trend continues, it could signal it\u2019s in the middle of a big investment cycle.\nTilray burned through $13.15 million of cash in Q2, equivalent to a negative 5.9% margin. The company\u2019s cash flow turned negative after being positive in the same quarter last year, but it\u2019s still above its two-year average. We wouldn\u2019t read too much into this quarter\u2019s decline because investment needs can be seasonal, leading to short-term swings. Long-term trends are more important.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nTilray\u2019s five-year average ROIC was negative 26.7%, meaning management lost money while trying to expand the business. Its returns were among the worst in the consumer staples sector. This quarter's ROIC figure is less meaningful largely due to $1.4 billion one-time impairment charge that depresses return calculations.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nTilray reported $256.4 million of cash and $321.6 million of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $55.04 million of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view Tilray\u2019s 1.2\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $29.95 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n12. Key Takeaways from Tilray\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly Tilray blew past analysts\u2019 EBITDA expectations this quarter. On the other hand, full-year EBITDA guidance missed. Additionally, its gross margin missed and its EPS fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates largely due to $1.4 billion one-time impairment charge. Overall, this quarter could have been better. The stock remained flat at $0.69 immediately following the results.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Tilray?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 12:00 AM EDT\nAre you wondering whether to buy Tilray or pass? We urge investors to not only consider the latest earnings results but also longer-term business quality and valuation as well.\nWe cheer for all companies serving everyday consumers, but in the case of Tilray, we\u2019ll be cheering from the sidelines. Although its revenue growth was solid over the last three years, it\u2019s expected to deteriorate over the next 12 months and its cash profitability fell over the last year. And while the company\u2019s projected EPS for the next year implies the company\u2019s fundamentals will improve, the downside is its declining operating margin shows the business has become less efficient.\nTilray\u2019s EV-to-EBITDA ratio based on the next 12 months is 12.8x. This multiple tells us a lot of good news is priced in - you can find more timely opportunities elsewhere.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $0.93 on the company (compared to the current share price of $1.05), implying they don\u2019t see much short-term potential in Tilray."

  "argos_summary": "Tilray Brands' shares surged 38.5% following President Trump's consideration of reclassifying marijuana, which could ease federal restrictions and provide tax relief under Internal Revenue Code Section 280E. Despite this optimism, Tilray reported disappointing Q2 results with a 2.3% revenue decline and a significant GAAP loss of $1.30 per share, largely due to a $1.4 billion impairment charge. Analysts remain skeptical about Tilray's long-term prospects, citing declining operating margins and a consensus price target that suggests limited short-term potential.",
