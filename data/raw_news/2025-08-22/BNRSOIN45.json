  "description": "H.C. Wainwright reiterates Buy rating on TuHURA Biosciences stock",
  "content": "Investing.com - H.C. Wainwright has reiterated its Buy rating and $12.00 price target on TuHURA Biosciences (NASDAQ: ) following the company\u2019s second-quarter financial results. The price target represents significant upside from the current trading price of $2.91, though InvestingPro analysis suggests the stock may be overvalued at current levels.\n\nTuHURA reported a net loss of $0.21 per share for the second quarter of 2025, which was wider than H.C. Wainwright\u2019s previous estimate of a $0.14 per share loss.\n\nThe company\u2019s research and development expenses reached $4.93 million while selling, general, and administrative expenses totaled $4.95 million, compared to the research firm\u2019s estimates of $4.7 million and $2.5 million, respectively.\n\nH.C. Wainwright has updated its projections for TuHURA, now forecasting a full-year 2025 net loss of $0.66 per share.\n\nTuHURA ended the second quarter with approximately $8.5 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, with H.C. Wainwright anticipating an additional equity raise of roughly $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nIn other recent news, TuHURA Biosciences has completed the acquisition of Kineta, adding a Phase 2 ready VISTA inhibiting monoclonal antibody to its pipeline. This acquisition follows the approval of all merger-related proposals by stockholders from both companies. In addition, TuHURA has initiated a Phase 3 trial for its lead drug candidate, IFx-2.0, in patients with advanced or metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma. The trial is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. H.C. Wainwright has reiterated its Buy rating on TuHURA Biosciences, maintaining a price target of $12.00. The company has also been added to the Russell 3000 and 2000 indexes, marking a significant milestone in its first year as a publicly traded entity. These developments highlight TuHURA\u2019s ongoing efforts in expanding its cancer immunotherapy portfolio.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.
