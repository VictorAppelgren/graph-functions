  "description": "The WordPress trademark applications for \"Managed WordPress\" and \"Hosted WordPress\" face a setback following the USPTO's rejection",
  "content": "The United States Patent and Trademark Office has rejected the WordPress Foundation\u2019s applications for trademarks on the phrases \u201cManaged WordPress\u201d and \u201cHosted WordPress.\u201d But WordPress isn\u2019t walking away just yet.\n\nThe Trademark Office published the following notice for the \u201cHosted WordPress\u201d trademark application:\n\n\u201cA final Office action refusing registration has been sent (issued) because the applicant neither satisfied nor overcame all requirements and/or refusals previously raised\u2026. SUMMARY OF ISSUES MADE FINAL that applicant must address: DISCLAIMER REQUIREMENT Applicant must disclaim the wording \u2018MANAGED\u2019 because it is merely descriptive of an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant\u2019s goods and services\u2026. Applicant may respond by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: No claim is made to the exclusive right to use \u2018MANAGED\u2019 apart from the mark as shown.\u201d\n\nThe USPTO also found that the WordPress Foundation\u2019s description of goods and services is too vague and overly broad, especially regarding the phrase \u201cwebsite development software,\u201d and asks them to clarify whether it is downloadable (Class 9) or offered as online services (Class 42). The USPTO suggested acceptable wording that they can adopt, as long as it accurately reflects what they provide.\n\nThe Trademark Office also issued the following response for the trademark application for Managed WordPress:\n\n\u201cDISCLAIMER REQUIREMENT\n\n Applicant must disclaim the wording \u2018MANAGED\u2019 because it is merely descriptive of an ingredient, quality, characteristic, function, feature, purpose, or use of applicant\u2019s goods and services\u2026. Applicant may respond by submitting a disclaimer in the following format: No claim is made to the exclusive right to use \u2018MANAGED\u2019 apart from the mark as shown.\u201d\n\nThe Process Is Not Over\n\nThe WordPress Foundation is continuing its efforts to obtain trademarks for both \u201cManaged WordPress\u201d and \u201cHosted WordPress.\u201d It has filed a Request for Reconsideration after Final Action for each trademark application, which asks the USPTO to reconsider its refusals based on amendments, arguments, or evidence. These requests are a final procedural step before an appeal, although they are not themselves appeals.",
