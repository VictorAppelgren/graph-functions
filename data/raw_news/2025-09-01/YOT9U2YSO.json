      "text": "Table of Contents\nOn May 15, Sony launched its latest flagship product, the noise-cancelling WH-1000XM6 headphones. It's been three long years since the previous-generation XM5 headphones were released, and there is one major design change: The headphones now fold up for easy portability.\nOtherwise, I'd class the changes as more iterative than innovative, but if you want best-in-class noise-cancellling headphones and pristine audio quality, the headphones deliver \u2014 with a catch. The new Sony XM6 headphones are about $50 more expensive than the XM5s.\nThe most likely explanation for the price increase? Tariffs, of course. There's been a rash of tech price hikes lately, but let's not go there.\nSo, how do the new Sony headphones sound? I've been testing the headphones ahead of their official launch, and I believe they (mostly) justify their $449.99 price tag. We'll be updating this review as we spend more time with these wireless headphones, but let's dive into my first-hand impressions.\nYou can also watch my Sony XM6 headphones review in video form, if you prefer:\nSony WH-1000XM6 Headphones review: How do they sound?\nWhen testing the XM6 headphones, I compared them to other elite wireless headphones and earbuds. Specifically, I've also tested the Sony XM5 headphones, Dyson OnTrac headphones, Bose QuietComfort Ultra, and Panasonic Technics AZ100s, among others. Sony's new flagship headphones definitely hold their own among other flagship cans and buds, but do they offer the best sound I've ever encountered? Not quite.\nThe new Sony headphones offer impressive audio quality, and they definitely improve on the XM5 models. The active noise cancellation is particularly phenomenal (more on that below). I really appreciated the overall balance, depth, and quality of the audio. For the XM6, Sony audio engineers worked with music mastering engineers here in the United States, and the results are clear when you listen to music. Like all headphone reviewers, I have a dedicated playlist for testing new audio products, and I found that vocal-heavy tracks sound particularly great, with noticeable improvements over the XM5s.\nWhile I tend to have weaker bass hearing, I had no trouble picking out the bass line in my favorite Radiohead tracks. As for the mid- and high-frequency range, the vocals on tracks like \"Hello\" from Adele and \"Someone You Loved\" by Lewis Capaldi rang out clearly, as did the strings in classic Mozart symphonies.\nHowever, I did have one small problem with the audio, which is a disappointment for a pair of $450 headphones. On extremely layered tracks like \"National Anthem\" from Radiohead or \"Outro\" by M83, I found the sound a little lacking in clarity. I wouldn't go so far as to call it muddy, but the soundscape did blur a touch. I also found that to truly appreciate all the richness of the XM6 sound, I had to turn the volume up a little higher than I'd like.\nHonestly, I think the Technics AZ100 earbuds have just ruined me for other audio products, as the latest Technics driver really has no equal in terms of clarity. Still, these headphones do sound very impressive, and they pass the \"bop\" test. As in, how much did I bop my head and play air drums while listening to my favorite music? If you're a music lover, I don't think you'll be disappointed with these cans.\nOne more note: If you love big-thumping bass, as I noted in my video review above, opt for the Sony ULT headphones, which prioritize bass.\nSony WH-1000XM6 Headphones review: What's new?\nSony introduced one major design change with the XM6 headphones: They now fold up for portability. The travel case is also sturdier (the XM5 travel case was truly terrible), with a magnetic closure instead of a very breakable zipper. The case may not look that much smaller in photos, but when you're stuffing them into a backpack, the compact size and shape make a big difference.\nSony also added a new processor to the headphones. The new Sony QN3 processor is seven times faster, according to Sony, and powers improved adaptive noise cancellation and better call quality thanks to \"AI beamforming\" tech. Sony also added additional microphones (12 versus the eight in the XM5) for improved noise cancellation. For phone calls, there are six dedicated mics instead of four.\nThe headband design has also been tweaked for improved comfort, and I have to say these headphones are extremely comfortable. Even while wearing them all day at the office, I didn't have any issues with comfort or ear fatigue.\nSony WH-1000XM6 Headphones review: What's not new?\nAfter three years, you might have hoped for bigger changes. I certainly did. While the foldable design is a much-appreciated change, and while there are improvements to sound, those are differences of degrees, not miles. Sony also made no improvements to battery life. The XM6 headphones have the same 30-hour battery life (with ANC engaged) as the last model. In my Dyson OnTrac review, I noted that Dyson hid extra battery packs in the headband to power its incredible 55-hour battery, but Sony seems to have opted for foldability over a battery improvement.\nThe overall aesthetic is still recognizably Sony, so if you liked the look of the XM5 headphones, you'll like the new design as well.\nTo me, they also prove that headphones have somewhat plateaued. Just look at the newest Apple AirPods Max headphones, which added USB-C charging and not much else with their most recent update. I imagine Sony and Apple audio engineers reluctantly telling their bosses, \"We can't make the drivers any better than they already are!\" That's not entirely fair, as Sony did make some tweaks for improved vocals (which you can really hear), but I do think we're reaching the peak of headphone quality, barring a big advancement in audio technology.\nTwo more important notes: First, the multi-point pairing here is absolutely seamless. I could switch between my iPhone and MacBook with no issues. Second, you can now listen to music and charge the headphones at the same time.\nSony WH-1000XM6 Headphones review: The ANC is incredible\nSony's flagship headphones have always been at the head of the pack with noise cancellation, and that legacy continues here. The ANC in the XM6 is as good as or better than any I've ever heard.\nGood noise cancellation should feel a little bit like magic. When the ANC engages, you should instantly step into a bubble of silence, and that's what you get here. With music playing, the noise cancellation is near perfect. Sure, on the subway, some sounds get through, but under normal listening conditions, it's spooky how sounds disappear. I like to use these headphones at work for their noise cancellation (with no music playing) just so I can focus better.\nOn the downside, while Sony says these headphones have adaptive noise cancellation, they don't really offer much personalization. Some Bose headphones (and the Technics earbuds I mentioned) let you fine-tune the ANC settings to your liking, which would have been a nice addition.\nThe new Sony XM6 Headphones: Just the specs\nProcessor: Sony QN3\nMicrophones: 12\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5.3 (LDAC support)\nBattery: 30 hours with ANC (40 hours without)\nCharge time: ~3.5 hours\nNoise cancellation: Active noise cancellation\nSpatial audio: Yes\nColors: Midnight blue, black, silver\nInputs: USB-C, 3.5mm audio jack\nQuick charge: 3 hours in 3 minutes\nSony WH-1000XM6 Headphones: Are they worth it?\nI say yes, absolutely. While I wouldn't say these headphones deliver the best sound I've ever heard, they come close. Add to that elite noise cancellation, a comfortable fit, and a travel-friendly design, and you have flagship headphones that justify their $450 price tag. That being said, they're not an instant upgrade if you already own the XM5 headphones. But if you have an older pair, want LDAC support, or just like the Sony product ecosystem, they're a worthy purchase, no doubt.\nWhile we don't love seeing a price increase, it has been three years since we got the XM5s. On top of that, other flagship headphones from brands like Bose, Dyson, Sonos, and Apple have all come in at $449 and above. If you're a music lover who wants the best possible sound, that's the new price of admission, folks.\nYou can buy the new Sony headphones now for $449.99 at Sony, Amazon, and Best Buy.\nTopics Music Mashable Choice Gadgets"

YOU MUST CLICK ON THE PROMOTION LINK FOR THE REWARDS OFFER DURING THE SAME SHOPPING SESSION THAT YOU COMPLETE YOUR PURCHASE FROM THE MERCHANT. THE PURCHASE MUST BE MADE IN US DOLLARS. IF YOU VISIT OTHER SITES BEFORE COMPLETING YOUR PURCHASE, OR IF YOU USE COUPON CODES NOT PROVIDED BY RETAILMENOT, YOUR PURCHASE MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH A SERVICE OTHER THAN RETAILMENOT AND YOU MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE REWARD(S). YOU MUST NOT ENABLE AN AD BLOCKER OR OTHERWISE DISABLE COOKIES ON YOUR COMPUTER, BECAUSE COOKIES ARE USED TO AUTHENTICATE YOUR PURCHASE. RetailMeNot In-Store Cash Back Rewards.

RetailMeNot may, in its sole discretion, extend or shorten the redemption period for a Rewards O\ufb00er. As between you and RetailMeNot, the determination as to what transactions are Qualifying Transactions shall be made by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Bonus Rewards. From time to time, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er a Bonus Reward to certain RetailMeNot members who complete a qualifying activity or who meet certain criteria, as de\ufb01ned in a Rewards O\ufb00er Card or Promotion Landing Page, in addition to or in combination with o\ufb00ers for Online Cash Back Rewards or In-Store Cash Back Rewards. For example, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er certain Bonus Rewards to new members who earn an Online Cash Back Reward for the \ufb01rst time or earn certain Online Cash Back Rewards for the \ufb01rst time. In order to earn a Bonus Reward, you must satisfy all criteria set forth for earning the Bonus Reward as well as the requirements of these Promotion Terms during the promotion period for the Bonus Reward. RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust the promotion period and/or the bonus amount for Bonus Reward, at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Bonus Rewards are a limited time o\ufb00er and all criteria must be satis\ufb01ed within the dates of the Promotion. Returns, Approvals, and No Ownership. For any Rewards O\ufb00er, if you return or exchange the items purchased, complete your purchase before or after the Promotion Period, initiate a purchase that results in a chargeback, or fail to satisfy a Minimum Purchase Amount, or any other conditions speci\ufb01ed on the Promotion Landing Page or Rewards O\ufb00er Card, RetailMeNot reserves the right to invalidate or withdraw all or part of the Rewards O\ufb00er, or reclaim Reward earnings. The determination of whether or not a purchase quali\ufb01es for the Rewards O\ufb00er and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed is at the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. In the event of a dispute, you may be required to provide your order con\ufb01rmation as proof of purchase. Order confirmations must be provided within six (6) months from the purchase date to qualify for this review. The timing of when RetailMeNot will issue an Approved Reward will vary based on a number of factors. These factors may include the type of Promotion pursuant to which a Reward is o\ufb00ered and your account activity as a member of RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the order and timing in which to process its con\ufb01rmation of eligible purchases. Rewards may be limited where participation exceeds the Total Rewards O\ufb00ers available during Promotion or in other cases, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. RetailMeNot also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reevaluate Approved Rewards, at any time, without notice, including, but not limited to, whether purchases qualify for the Promotion and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed, and RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust or withdraw any Rewards O\ufb00ers or any Approved Rewards (or reclaim Reward earnings), at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Participating in a Rewards O\ufb00er does not give you ownership or any other legal claim to any Reward unless and until RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, determines that you have met all eligibility criteria and ful\ufb01lled all requirements for the Promotion and you have completed the Redemption Process. Rewards O\ufb00ers are provided solely by RetailMeNot and are not underwritten or funded by any other third party. You may not make any claims for Rewards O\ufb00ers against Merchants or any other third party. Notwithstanding that Rewards O\ufb00ers may include o\ufb00ers of cash, prior to redemption, Rewards O\ufb00ers and Approved Rewards have no monetary value and you may not obtain any money or any other thing of value for any Approved Reward or participation in any Rewards O\ufb00er unless and until you complete the Redemption Process and a payment has been issued by RetailMeNot for Approved Rewards. Wallet and Redeeming Rewards. Approved Rewards will be shown in the RetailMeNot Rewards Wallet. You have no vested rights in Approved Rewards unless and until you complete the Redemption Process. If your RetailMeNot account is terminated by RetailMeNot, as provided in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, or if you elect to close your RetailMeNot account, you will no longer be permitted to access the Rewards Wallet or redeem Approved Rewards shown therein. You may redeem Approved Rewards for cash using PayPal or Venmo. Redeeming for cash to Paypal or Venmo. In order to redeem Approved Rewards for cash via PayPal or Venmo, you must: (1) have or create a PayPal or Venmo Account that is linked to the phone number or email address, where applicable, that RetailMeNot has on \ufb01le for you; (2) navigate to the \u201cMy Rewards\u201d section of your account, click \u201cRedeem Rewards\u201d, and then click either \u201cPaypal\u201d or \u201cVenmo\u201d, as applicable; and (3) perform any actions speci\ufb01ed in the RetailMeNot app or website, as modi\ufb01ed from time to time in the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. For example, such actions may include, but are not limited to, authenticating your account by providing a US based cell phone number with SMS capabilities, re-entering a password, and clicking the appropriate link or button. Once you have completed the required steps to redeem Approved Rewards, RetailMeNot will issue a payment to the PayPal or Venmo Account, as applicable, that is linked to the email address, or phone number, as applicable, that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account. An email or text message, where applicable, will be sent to that email address or phone number, where applicable, con\ufb01rming that the payment has been issued. Generally, redemption of an Approved Reward will result in the issuing of payment within minutes, but in some cases may require a longer time period. RetailMeNot is not responsible for lost or stolen payments or for delivery of payments to the wrong PayPal or Venmo account. If an account has not been credited with a Qualifying Transaction in the previous 12 months, it may be deemed an Inactive Cash Back Account. Accounts which meet this criteria will be debited a monthly maintenance fee in the amount of the lesser of $2.00 or the current account balance. Maintenance fees will not draw the account balance below $0.00. Maintenance fees will be assessed until the account balance reaches $0.00 or the account becomes an active cash back user again. Forced Redemptions. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with any limitations or requirements speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot from time to time, including, but not limited to, requirements not to redeem Approved Rewards that exceed amounts speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, from time to time, to cause the redemption of Approved Rewards, in whole or in part, and issue payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, but RetailMeNot undertakes no obligation to do so under any circumstances. You hereby authorize RetailMeNot to perform any such redemptions and issue any such payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, automatically and without further action by you. Abuse and Cancellations. RetailMeNot reserves the right to cancel, suspend and/or modify a user\u2019s account, entire Promotion, or any part of it, or the payment of any Rewards amounts at any time without obligation or notice to you, including, without limitation, if any fraud, technical failures, limit of available Rewards, gaming, human error or any other factor impairs the integrity, availability or proper functioning of the Promotion, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Without limiting anything in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify, terminate or suspend the participation in any Promotion, or otherwise prevent future participation, of any individual it \ufb01nds, or reasonably suspects, to be tampering with the operation of a Promotion (including by submitting or attempting to submit fraudulent or ineligible Receipts) or to be acting in violation of the Promotion Terms or any promotion, or in behaving in an unethical, dishonest, deceptive or disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to deliberately undermine the legitimate operation of the Promotion may be in violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, RetailMeNot reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. RetailMeNot shall not be liable to you for any suspension, modi\ufb01cation or termination of a Rewards O\ufb00er, Approved Rewards, or the Promotion program. Use of any automated means or more than one account is prohibited and will result in disquali\ufb01cation. In the event of any dispute as to the quali\ufb01cation of potential recipients of a Reward, the authorized account holder of the email address or phone number provided to RetailMeNot at the time the account was created will be deemed the quali\ufb01ed Reward recipient. The \u201cauthorized account holder\u201d is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address. Each potential recipient of Rewards may be required to show proof of being an authorized account holder. If your account remains inactive for 24 months, RetailMeNot reserves the right to permanently close the Account at which time the cash back rewards will be considered expired and will no longer be eligible for redemption. Before closing the Account, RetailMeNot will attempt to alert you to the fact that your account may be shut down due to inactivity. Premium Services: Certain Services provided by Ziff Davis require registration and payment (such Services are referred to collectively as the \u201cPremium Services\u201d). You are responsible for paying any and all charges relating to your Premium Services account, including without limitation, periodic subscription fees (the initial fee and automatic renewals). You grant to Ziff Davis\u2019 third party payment processor(s) permission to charge your credit card (or other approved payment mechanism) to pay for all such charges.

If Ziff Davis does not receive payment from the credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon our demand. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection with the Premium Services, and you must refer to that agreement and not this Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder.

For CNET Cash Back and Rewards Services Acceptance of terms. By using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood these terms and conditions, and that you agree to be legally bound by all of them. You also acknowledge that you have had an opportunity to review and agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to all of these terms and conditions, you may not participate in or use the Services. Eligibility. You represent and warrant that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age. If you are under age eighteen (18), you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, use the Services. Rewards. The Services enable you to access and earn rewards, subject to the guidelines herein (\u201cServices\u201d). CNET offers users opportunities to earn cash back on their purchases from Merchants activated by the creation of trackable links (\u201cLinks\u201d) for a Merchant as a way to incentivize the purchase and promotion of the Merchant\u2019s products. Links are configured to track and attribute transactions to you so that you may earn a reward if you or someone to whom you send a Link completes a qualifying transaction with a Merchant. The CNET cashback program is an incentive and promotional program. Some transactions may not earn rewards or may earn at a rate different from the rate indicated by the Service. You are not guaranteed to earn a reward from a transaction for several reasons, without notice to you, including, without limitation: Merchants may alter terms, conditions, or commission rates. Merchants may discontinue their programs. Merchants may exclude certain products from Reward eligibility. Merchants may have technical failures which result in transactions failing to be tracked or attributed to you. Links may fail to function properly. Links may be disabled by web browsers or ad blockers. Merchants may reject transactions due to suspected policy violations. Other: charge-backs, product returns, accounting error, Merchant non-payment, fraudulent transactions, our inability to contact you to validate transactions, your inappropriate distribution of Links, or your failure to comply with Merchant policies. If the Merchant pays less than the expected amount or does not pay a commission for the transaction, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to adjust or cancel the reward. Furthermore, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to withhold, cancel or adjust the amount of any reward, for any reason at any time. By using the Services, you accept this condition. CNET may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any person, including any affiliate, without your consent. Payout timing. We only provide a reward to you after a transaction is successfully tracked and completed, after we receive payment for that specific transaction from the Merchant, and after you accrue the Minimum Redemption Amount (as defined below). Merchants usually have holdback periods during which they hold a pending payment (for example, until the expiration of a return policy and/or until a service is consumed). Rewards remain in a pending state until we receive payment from the Merchant for the associated transaction. After we receive payment and you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, you may request to redeem your rewards. Payout Threshold. A minimum approved balance of $10.00 is required for redemption (the \u201cMinimum Redemption Amount\u201d). This amount may change from time to time, in our sole discretion, without notice to you. If your balance is below the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards will be stored in a record on your account and may be subject to a Dormant Account Fee (as defined below). Once you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards may be redeemed for third-party merchant gift cards. Use of a third-party merchant gift card at a selected merchant will be subject to such merchant\u2019s and/or the gift card issuer\u2019s own terms of service. Coupons. Some rewards may include coupons, discounts or promotions from Merchants (\u201cOffers\u201d). We do not guarantee that Merchants will honor Offers. Offer codes may be expired or invalid. Offers may not be eligible for your transaction, based upon exclusions, terms and conditions determined by Merchants. Offers are not redeemable for any value with CNET. Dormant accounts. If you have pending rewards and your account has no new activity (defined as the earning of a pending reward) for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days, we reserve the right to assess a monthly Dormant Account Fee of up to $5.00 USD, until such time as your reward balance reaches $0.00, to recover the cost associated with maintenance of the account. Any Dormant Account Fee we apply may or may not be displayed in your user dashboard. If your account has no new activity for a period of twelve (12) months, we reserve the right to void any remaining balance of rewards in your account. Tax. You are solely responsible for independently assessing and complying with all relevant tax and legal requirements. We shall not provide you with tax or legal advice. Cookies. Some Merchants may place cookies (or other tracking beacons) on your device to recognize your device during a subsequent visit. If you, or those clicking on your shared Link, block or delete cookies, tracking and attribution may be inoperable, in which case no reward shall be earned. Third-Party Services. We do not endorse, warrant or guarantee the products, services or content of Merchants or other third parties. We are not an agent, broker or otherwise responsible for any Merchant\u2019s activities, policies, products or services.

International Use We make no claims that any Material, Services or any Content is appropriate or may be downloaded outside of the United States or outside the country where such Material, Services or any Content was produced.

Binding Arbitration In the unlikely event that you\u2019re not satisfied with customer service\u2019s solution, and you and Ziff Davis are unable to resolve a dispute through the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures below, we each agree to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court.

Unless expressly limited by this arbitration provision, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. In arbitration you may be entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees from us to the same extent as you would be in court. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT (1) Claims Subject to Arbitration: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Ziff Davis and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us, except for claims arising from bodily injury or that pertain to enforcing, protecting, or the validity of your or our intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of our licensors, affiliates and partners). This Arbitration Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other statutory or common-law legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of physical bodily injury; claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a current member of a certified class; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. References to \u201cZiff Davis,\u201d \u201cyou,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d in this Arbitration Agreement include our respective predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as our respective past, present, and future parents, subsidiaries and affiliates (including Ziff Davis, Inc., Ziff Davis, LLC, Everyday Health, Inc., Everyday Health Media, LLC, and their affiliates); those entities and our respective agents, employees, licensees, licensors, and providers of content as of the time your or our claim arises; and all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Services under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may elect to have claims heard in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. This Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action and to a trial by jury to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement. (2) Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, a party who intends to initiate arbitration or file a claim in small claims court must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d). A Notice from you to Ziff Davis must be emailed to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com (\u201cNotice Address\u201d). Any Notice must include (i) the claimant\u2019s name, address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) if you are submitting the Notice, any relevant facts regarding your use of the Sites, including whether you have created an account with or receive any newsletters associated with any of the Sites; (iv) a description of the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation for them; and (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person\u2019s dispute. After receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and we agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). If you are unable to participate in the settlement conference by video, you may attend telephonically upon showing of good cause or extraordinary circumstances warranting telephonic participation (e.g., inability to afford equipment or sufficient Wi-Fi due to indigent circumstances). You and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted by small claims court rules). Compliance with this Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section 13(2). All of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are essential so that you and Ziff Davis have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures. If the arbitration is already pending, it shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with these Procedures in arbitration. (3) Arbitration Procedure: The arbitration will be governed by applicable rules of National Arbitration & Mediation (\u201cNAM\u201d) (including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable) (\u201cNAM Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and will be administered by NAM. (If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a75.) The NAM Rules are available online at www.namadr.com or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. You may obtain a form to initiate arbitration at: https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf or by contacting NAM. We and you agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a certification that they have complied with and completed the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures requirements referenced in Section 13(2) and that they are a party to the Arbitration Agreement enclosed with or attached to the demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented). All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers. Unless we and you agree otherwise, or the applicable NAM Rules dictate otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address and you and a Ziff Davis representative will be required to attend in person. At the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator\u2019s decision is binding only between you and Ziff Davis and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party. An arbitrator\u2019s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court. As in court, you and Ziff Davis agree that any counsel representing a party in arbitration certifies when initiating and proceeding in arbitration that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including certification that the claim or relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law, against all appropriately represented parties and counsel. Except as expressly provided in the Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties could have received in court, including awards of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, in accordance with applicable law. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the parties shall bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or finds that either the substance of the claim, the defense, or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 (b)). (4) Arbitration Fees: The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules, unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. If after exhausting any potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the arbitration fees will be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith. You and we agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with NAM to address the reduction or deferral of fees. (5) Confidentiality: Upon either party\u2019s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law. (6) Offer of Settlement: In any arbitration between you and Ziff Davis, the defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the other party\u2019s favor and is less than the defending party\u2019s settlement offer or if the award is in the defending party\u2019s favor, the other party must pay the defending party\u2019s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney\u2019s fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the claim may be entitled for the cause of action under which it is suing. (7) Requirement of Individualized Relief: The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or private attorney general proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then the parties agree such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other arbitrable claims and requests for relief are arbitrated. You agree that any arbitrations between you and Ziff Davis will be subject to this Section 13 and not to any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, and, notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that this Section 13 amends any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, including with respect to claims that arose before this or any prior arbitration agreement. (8) Opt Out of Future Changes: Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if Ziff Davis makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending Ziff Davis an email to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com within 30 days of the posting of the amended arbitration agreement that provides: (i) your full legal name, (ii) your complete mailing address, (iii) your phone number, (iv) if applicable, the username or email address associated with any potential account or newsletter; (v) the relevant Site; and (vi) the approximate date of your initial use of the relevant Site. Such an opt-out email must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether. (9) Mass Filing: If, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Notices or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against the other party or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (\u201cMass Filing\u201d) set forth in NAM\u2019s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (\u201cNAM\u2019s Mass Filing Rules,\u201d available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), you and we agree that the additional procedures set forth below shall apply. The parties agree that throughout this process, their counsel shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. The parties acknowledge and agree that by electing to participate in a Mass Filing, the adjudication of their dispute might be delayed. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled beginning when the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are initiated, so long as the pre-arbitration Notice complies with the requirements in Section 13(2), until your claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration. Stage One: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Two: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 50 claims per side (100 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Three: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 100 claims per side (200 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a third staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. Following this third set of staged proceedings, counsel for claimants may elect to have the parties participate in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge. Stage Four: If your claim is not resolved at this time, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 100, then 100 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 100, then all of those claims shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 100 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsel for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation, and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with this Agreement. You and Ziff Davis agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and Ziff Davis acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.(10) Severability: If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible. The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein. 15. CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER You and Ziff Davis agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each party may bring claims (whether in court or in arbitration) against the other only in an individual capacity, and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. This means that you and Ziff Davis may not bring a claim on behalf of a class or group and may not bring a claim on behalf of any other person unless doing so as a parent, guardian, or ward of a minor or in another similar capacity for an individual who cannot otherwise bring their own individual claim. This also means that you and Ziff Davis may not participate in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding brought by any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Ziff Davis may participate in a class-wide settlement. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Ziff Davis waive any right to a jury trial. 16. Limitation Period for Claims You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of our sites or the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. 17. Miscellaneous We may be required by international, state or federal law to notify you of certain events. You hereby acknowledge and consent that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on our sites or delivering them to you through e-mail. Subject to the arbitration provision above and for all purposes of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to principles of choice of law. You and Ziff Davis each irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in New York, New York, the Borough of Manhattan (the \u201cCourts\u201d) with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or to the Services (including without limitation any Content) and waive any objection to venue in any of the Courts for such an action, suit or proceeding (whether based on forum non conveniens or otherwise); additionally, you agree that you will not bring any such action, suit or proceeding in any court other than the Courts. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. If any inconsistency exists between the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms and conditions posted on the Services, such terms shall be interpreted as to eliminate any inconsistency, if possible, and otherwise, the additional terms and conditions shall control. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, (i) such provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, the intent of the parties, (ii) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (iii) such decision shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision under other circumstances. Ziff Davis\u2019 failure to enforce any term of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. No waiver shall be binding unless in writing and signed by Ziff Davis, and such waiver shall not be construed as Ziff Davis\u2019 waiver of any other or subsequent breach. 18. New Jersey Residents If, and to the extent that New Jersey law applies, with respect to residents of New Jersey, the terms in Sections 6 (insofar as any claims may arise from, or relate to, consumer protection or fraud and/or misrepresentation, or result in attorney\u2019s fees), 9 and 14 do not limit any rights you may have as a consumer under New Jersey law and are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as permitted by the laws of the state of your residence. Subject to the foregoing, Ziff Davis, third party content providers, and their respective agents reserve all rights, defenses, and permissible limitations under New Jersey law. Nothing in this Section shall modify the binding arbitration clause and waiver for class action and jury trial in Section 13. 19. Australia Residents Nothing in these Terms (including in Sections 6, 9 and 15) limits, excludes or modifies any rights you may have under any law, including under the Australian Consumer Law (the \u201cACL\u201d) and consumer guarantees under the ACL, which may not be limited, excluded or modified by agreement (including where such exclusion, restriction or modification would be illegal or void under such law). 20. Privacy Policy The applicable privacy policy will be made available on the property from which you accessed these Terms. Such privacy policy is incorporated by reference into these Terms. QUESTIONS?Please contact ZDLegal1@ziffdavis.com and insert \u201cTerms of Use\u201d in the subject line if you have any questions or comments about the Agreement, or to report user conduct violating the Agreement."

While these don't offer noise cancellation (that'll cost you another $49), our reviewer was extremely impressed with their sound. They last a little longer than the noise-cancelling option at about five hours per charge (30 with the charging case), making them a great daily driver. This is only the second time the buds have dropped below the $90 threshold.\nGet this Labor Day deal right here.\nBest iPad Air Deal: \"Apple's new iPad Air doesn't feel very new, as the only major difference is the new M3 chip,\" Mashable's reviewer writes of the M3 iPad Air released earlier this year. That's not a bad thing, though. Besides the hefty new processor that unlocks Apple Intelligence, the M3 Air features better battery life, a more advanced Magic Keyboard (optional add-on), and pass-through charging. We think it's the best iPad option for more people, especially now that it's down to just $449 at Amazon. That's its best price on record.\nGet this limited-time offer here.\nLauren Allain is a freelance journalist covering deals at Mashable.

As of Sept. 1, Amazon has dropped the price of the Beats Studio Pro headphones by more than $100.

The tool allows users to search for content using numerous other search queries, such as mood. Being that the feature is powered by OpenAI, it appears likely that users will be able to use natural language in their search.\nArtificial intelligence isn't completely new to Netflix. The streaming company utilizes AI to power its recommendation algorithm, to help subscribers discover content based on their viewing history.\nWhile Netflix is experimenting with AI, the company clearly knows of the pushback from creatives on the technology, and has previously gone on the record to say it would not use AI to replace filmmakers, screenwriters, or actors.\nThe AI search engine is currently in the testing phase. It's currently only available on iOS devices and to some customers in Australia and New Zealand. In addition, those subscribers need to specifically opt-in to use the tool.\nNetflix expects to expand the test out to other countries, including the U.S., in the near future."

      "url": "https://mashable.com/article/how-to-choose-a-robot-vacuum",
      "text": "How to choose a robot vacuum in 2025: Don't buy one before considering these features\nTable of Contents\nMaking the call to buy a robot vacuum instead of a stick vacuum now isn't the risk that it was half a decade ago. Not when you have a grasp on the robot vacuum features to look for.\nBack then, lazy suction power and even lazier attempts to return to the dock had many robot vacuum lemons collecting dust while their embittered owners reverted to vacuuming by hand. But in 2025, the best robot vacuum brands like iRobot, Roborock, Shark, and Eufy have robust lineups of robot vacuums that actually make life easier \u2014 not harder. And as more and more robot vacuums adapt to the changing expectations from consumers, features that were once considered premium are much easier to afford nowadays.\nDespite the less intimidating cost spectrum, it's still possible to underpay or overpay for a robot vacuum. The question isn't whether or not a robot vacuum is worth it in your home at all \u2014 it's about which features are worth it in your home. So many brands offering affordable premium features can make it hard to know how to choose a robot vacuum that'll best suit you. I can yap about all of my learned tips on how to make your robot vacuum work better once you already have it. But for those still in the shopping phase, here's a straightforward buyer's guide on the most important factors to consider before buying a robot vacuum.\nDo I need a self-emptying robot vacuum?\nSelf-emptying robot vacuums are definitely worth the convenience, regardless of how big your space is. If you're already trying to absolve yourself of vacuuming responsibilities, chances are that you also won't feel like dealing with the dust bin multiple times per week.\nWhen cleaning is automated, your floors are probably going to be swept more often, anyway, filling up a robot vacuum's onboard dustbin faster. Larger homes and homes with pets will expedite dustbin fullness as well. A self-emptying robot vacuum will come in clutch here, which automatically empties its debris into the same dock it charges on. This leaves you off the hook from any dustbin maintenance for at least a month or two.\nAutomatic emptying docks do require more floor space than the toaster-sized docks of standalone models. But there are many compact self-emptying robot vacuums that would fit in a small space.\nWhat is a smart mapping robot vacuum?\nIf there's one robot feature that you don't skip, make it this. Smart mapping is a type of navigational tech that enables a robot vacuum to scope out and remember a copy of your home's floor plan. The map drawn during the vacuum's initial mapping run will pop up in the corresponding smartphone app, where you tweak it by dragging and dropping borders, merging or splitting rooms, and adding labels. Then, the robot vacuum can clean specific rooms that need attention that day, or complete a whole-home clean.\nRobot vacuums with smart mapping are usually far more agile when it comes to maneuvering around furniture. The bump-and-go approach that most early robot vacuums rely on just can't perceive a jungle of chair legs until it's too late. I'll die on the hill that smart mapping is the baseline brain power that any robot vacuum worth your money should have. If you think about it, actual cleaning skills don't even come into play if a robot vacuum can't successfully get itself to the spots that need to be cleaned.\nLuckily, smart mapping isn't an expensive ask nowadays. A budget cap of $200 is more than enough to secure room-to-room mapping from reliable brands like Shark or Roborock.\nSpot cleaning and virtual no-go zone\nMost robot vacuums that can remember the different rooms in your home can also adhere to app-drawn barriers around smaller zones within those rooms, like around a pile of Lego bricks or your pet's water bowl. This capability is crucial if you purchase a robot vacuum that does mop but doesn't recognize the difference between tile and a bath mat (more on this in the mopping section below).\nSmall obstacle avoidance\nThis navigational prowess would mean you shouldn't have to set keep-out zones in the app at all. Robot vacuums with small obstacle avoidance can detect and avoid problem-causers like cords, laundry, and even pet waste \u2014 things that are bound to show up on the floor on one day or another. The freedom that comes with skipping the pre-tidying routine is far too convenient.\nWhile the cameras used to perceive obstacles in front of them aren't exactly the kind that take pictures, some fancier robot vacuums legitimately have livestream cameras. These give you a floor-level view of whatever the vacuum sees as it's roving your home, making it a pretty comforting tool for pet parents when they're away. Some cameras are even accompanied by two-way microphones to talk to your pets or call another person who's at home.\nWhat robot vacuum works best on hardwood floors?\nRobot vacuums have a much easier time sweeping free-floating debris off hardwood or tile than carpet. However, crumbs and hair don't have anything to grab onto on hard floors like they do on carpet, so debris often gets blown into corners. If you're picky about the cleanliness of the outskirts of the room like I am, look for a robot vacuum with a dedicated extendable edge sweeping brush. These go further than the lousy side brush affixed to cheap robot vacuums \u2014 they actually reach out a few inches past the robot vacuum's circular shape to push debris out of 90-degree angles and edges, like along the kitchen counter. Roborock's FlexiArm, seen on the Saros 10 and Saros 10R vacuums, is my favorite example.\nCan robot vacuums go from hardwood to carpet?\nYes, just about any modern robot vacuum can switch between floor types without a hiccup. However, if your home has a heavy rug situation (including those pesky fluffy bath rugs), look for a robot vacuum with large wheels that can hoist it over various thresholds and carpet piles.\nIf your home has a pretty even mix of hard floors and carpet or rugs, floor type sensors will make your life easier. With these, a botvac can tell the difference between hard floors and soft ones, adjusting its suction method (and sometimes even how high it's hovering over the floor) accordingly. This looks like suction that's automatically boosted when the robot vacuum encounters carpet or, lifting mopping pads when the vac approaches a rug.\nDo I need a robot vacuum that mops?\nIt's definitely worth getting a robot vacuum and mop combo if your home has a lot of hard flooring. If you don't feel like doing your own vacuuming, you're probably even more severely depleted of the motivation to do your own mopping.\nMopping intensity varies greatly from vacuum to vacuum. While nearly any 2-in-1 model can probably reliably wipe up a fresh juice spill with its wet cloth, a mopping mechanism like sonic mopping (which vibrates) or dual pressurized mopping pads (which spin) exert the elbow grease needed to penetrate dried stains or shoe prints. Many flagship hybrid models released in 2023 or later can also mop with a cleaning solution rather than just plain water \u2014 if you're big on true barefoot-ready sanitation. You could even shop for a soap based on your floor type, like hardwood cleaning solution or pet-safe ingredients.\nSelf-cleaning mopping pads\nWhen deciding on a robot vacuums that mop, you have two options: models that can go from vacuuming to mopping by themselves, or models that need you to be home to physically make the switch to mopping mode. Cheaper 2-in-1 robot vacuums require a person to attach a water tank or mopping pad to switch to mopping mode, while more advanced models permanently have their mopping gear onboard and are ready to start mopping whenever called upon.\nThe first approach is typically more affordable, but your robot vacuum won't be able to complete a full vacuum and mop session if you're not home to ditch the water tank. These docks also tend to get smelly if not tended to regularly enough, along with mildewy mopping pads if you don't toss them in the laundry often enough. This level of manual involvement is more annoying than it's worth to some people \u2014 a lot of folks on Reddit ask for vacuum-only robot vacuum recommendations to avoid dealing with it altogether.\nYou can get out of this by opting for a robot vacuum and mop that can wash and dry its own mopping pads. Their self-empty dock also houses two water tanks \u2014 one for rinsing and refilling clean water, and one to hold the dirty water \u2014 plus fans beneath the vacuum for drying. If you're worried about bacteria or mildew, look for a self-cleaning dock that dries with hot hair.\nThe ideal robot vacuum and mop combo for pet hair will have this feature to mitigate the amount of fur that builds up on a mopping pad.\nAutomated mop washing isn't what it was during its initial breakout in 2024. Now, you have plenty of opportunities to score a self-washing and -drying hybrid model for as low as $500, especially during a sale event.\nWhat robot vacuums work well on carpet?\nVacuuming gets trickier on carpet, where debris clings to carpet like velcro after being stepped on all the time.\nI'll get into suction power in a second, but the brushroll system can make or break a robot vacuum's carpet performance just as much as the power under the hood. The best robot vacuums for carpet wield dual spinning brushrolls. On some robot vacs, these brushrolls sit parallel and spin toward each other to pinch debris and yank it from the carpet fibers. If your one non-negotiable is a robot vacuum that works on pet hair, you might consider a setup where the brushrolls are arranged beside each other \u2014 it'll kind of look like one big brushroll, but with a break in the middle. That opening shoot prevents hair wrapping by pulling hair up into the dust bin instead of pooling it at the sides of the roll.\nWhat is good suction power for a robot vacuum?\nMost robot vacuum brands measure suction power in pascals (Pa). As of August 2025, the strongest robot vacuum you can buy hits 22,000 Pa, though a new Dreame robot vacuum is set to clock 30,000 Pa when it comes out in the fall. Such intense cyclonic oomph isn't necessary in all homes, though I would generally advise against settling for anything less than 5,500 Pa.\nWhat is a good robot vacuum battery life?\nA 90- to 100-minute battery life is sufficient for a robot vacuum to cover an apartment on one charge. This is also fine if most of your cleaning will be done on a room-by-room basis. Battery life of more than 150 minutes isn't hard to find and is ideal for square footage surpassing 2,000.\nWhen battery is low, the robot vacuum will head back to its dock to juice up. Even the cheapest robot vacuums nowadays are self-charging and should automatically resume cleaning afterwards \u2014 meaning you won't have to pick them up and escort them back to the base.\nTopics Robot Vacuums\nFrequently Asked Questions\nLiDAR is a laser-based detection system that scans different points in your home to determine where walls are. LiDAR is quick and accurate, and has solidified its spot as the most prominent form of detection tech in the robot vacuum realm.\nOther robot vacuums map with VSLAM technology, which uses cameras rather than lasers to perceive your home's floor plan. The downside of most VSLAM systems is that they need light to operate, meaning less-advanced robot vacs using VSLAM may struggle to get around in the dark. iRobot, however, has figured out an advanced camera system that incorporates an LED to light the way, not only accurately picking up on walls, but super small obstacles, even in low lighting.\nLeah Stodart is a Philadelphia-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable where she covers and tests essential home tech like vacuums and TVs, plus eco-friendly hacks. Her ever-evolving experience in these categories comes in clutch when making recommendations on how to spend your money during shopping holidays like Black Friday, which Leah has been covering for Mashable since 2017."

      "text": "The best Bluetooth speakers, tested for sound, portability, and cool factor\nOverview\nTable of Contents\nA Bluetooth speaker is one of those devices that, once you find one you like, you won't be able to imagine how you lived without it.\nSince both Bluetooth and speakers aren't exactly new technology, you'll find that this is one of the more expansive product categories (admittedly, this feels like the case for almost anything you buy these days).\nEnter: the Mashable tech and shopping teams. We stay on top of the latest Bluetooth speaker releases, while also applying our audio and product testing expertise to determine when old favorites are the better choice. We spend time testing the speakers in our own homes, evaluating the balance in their sound, portability, and of course, their prices. (To learn more about how we choose the best Bluetooth speakers, check out the \"How we tested\" section).\nAs of June 2025, our top picks include the near-indestructible JBL Charge 6, smart home-integrated Sonos Move 2, and charmingly retro (but brand new) Marshall Emberton III. You'll find many of our top-ranked portable Bluetooth speakers below, along with new additions from Anker, Beats, Sony, and Ultimate Ears.\nWe created this guide by sifting through our past Bluetooth speaker reviews from Mashable staff and freelancers, as well as testing out new speakers specifically for this article.\nThis category speakers for itself (get it?), but we make sure to test every speaker with a variety of audio types (from audiobooks to videos to podcasts) and music genres. Where available, we look at equalizer options and see how they impact the sound of a speaker. Of course, we also test out the full volume range and evaluate whether it impacts the balance of the sound at any point. Other notable sound features we thoroughly test are adaptive audio modes, Bluetooth codecs, digital assistance (Google Assistant, Siri), mono and stereo, and speakerphone capability.\nA speaker's portability (and usability) suffers if it can't stay alive for a least a few hours. Typically, we test speakers out for at least a week with regular use to see how often someone might have to charge them. It's not a perfect science, as we play around with special features and the volume settings. Our goal is to get the most accurate read of playtime for the average user and see if the speaker falls within the battery life claimed by brands. Something else we inspect is whether the speaker supports quick charging.\nFor a Bluetooth speaker's design, we look at a few different factors, including any water or dust proof rating, its size and options for taking it on the go, and even whether or not it would like nice (or distractingly bad) on a bookshelf in someone's home.\nFinally, we look at how all the above contribute to the speaker's price point. We expect a $200 speaker to have markedly better sound quality and more features than a $80 speaker. As we expand our testing pool, we take into consideration how different speakers match up to their competitors.\nJBL Charge 6\nBest for most people\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Doubles as a portable charger\n- Even better sound than its predecessor\n- Can get loud enough to be used outdoors at a party\n- IP68-rated water- and dust-proof\n- Adjustable EQ with companion app\n- Pair with other Auracast-enabled JBL speakers for stereo sound\n- On the larger side, so may not be the best option for folks looking for maximum portability\n- At a higher starting price than the Charge 5\nWho it's for\nThe JBL Charge 6 is big enough to produce sound that will fill an outdoor party, yet still small enough to live on your bookshelf. Plus, it can charge other devices with a USB-C connection. On balance, we think it's the best Bluetooth speaker for most people right now.\nWhy we picked this\nThe Charge 6 is one of the latest speakers from JBL, the brand behind the popular Flip Bluetooth speakers. Though the Charge 6 is bigger and $50 more expensive, we prefer it for the versatility and superior sound it offers.\nWe have to start with the namesake of this speaker \u2014 it's ability to charge devices. That makes it an exceptionally good choice for beach days or camping trips. JBL ditched the USB-A port on the Charge 5, opting instead for a USB-C to USB-C cable that allowed us to charge phones, earbuds, and even other speakers. Cool as it was, this feature alone isn't what made this speaker stand out.\nEven at the lowest volumes, the Charge 6's sound easily filled a living room, but never sacrificed quality for loudness. When listening to Japanese Breakfast's For Melancholy Brunettes (& sad women), the sound balance came through strong and clear. I could hear both the bass notes and Michelle Zauner's voice ringing out with impressive clarity, and without losing the sound of the guitar. The companion app also comes with four different equalizer presets and a custom equalizer, so you can adjust the sound to be just right for your ears.\nThe Charge 6 also offers a couple of ways to amplify your sound even further. Thanks to the included Auracast, you can pair it with other JBL speakers with Auracast to double up on the sound or create a studio mode. When we tested it out with the Flip 6, it worked without a hitch. If you want a louder sound and more battery life, you can toggle on the speaker's PlaytimeBoost mode, which offers an extra four hours of battery life, though the quality of the sound sometimes struggles in this mode.\nWhether you're taking it with you on the go or using it at home, the Charge 6 gives you options. For instance, the flat base allows it to sit on a table without any danger of rolling off, but if you prefer it to stand instead, it's also reliably balanced, thanks to the silicone ends. Though this speaker is larger than most of our other picks, it does come with an adjustable handle strap, which you can loop, use as a handle, or remove entirely. Ultimately, though, if you're looking for something that can easily fit into most bags, we recommend the smaller Flip 7 instead.\nDetails\nUltimate Ears Wonderboom 4\nBest under $100\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Impressive, balanced sound for its size\n- Waterproof and dust-proof\n- Rugged, durable, and drop-proof up to five feet\n- Fun, bold colors\n- Compact and easy to toss in your bag\n- It floats!\n- USB-C chargeable\n- Bass isn't as deep as larger speakers and gets distorted at higher volumes\n- We didn't enjoy the Podcast Mode EQ setting\n- No companion app\nWho it's for\nThe Ultimate Ears Wonderboom 4 is not a must-have upgrade for anyone who owns the Wonderboom 3, but like the former version, it's a powerhouse for its size and price. This speaker's small (and rugged enough) to take along for a hike, while traveling, and for tossing next to the pool. Plus, it's so easy to find on sale that it's often available at a cheaper price than the older Wonderboom 3.\nWhy we picked this\nThe Wonderboom 4 is basically the same exact speaker as the Wonderboom 3, visually and internally. Like the Wonderboom 3, you can drop it from heights of up to five feet without worrying about destroying it. It\u2019s also waterproof with an IP67 rating. If you drop it in water, it can float for up to 30 minutes and come out the other side working completely fine. It also features a healthy 14 hours of battery life, which is more than other speakers of a similar size.\nSo what's different? On the sound front, the Wonderboom 4 has less muddiness than its predecessor, especially at higher volumes. In addition to the Outdoor Boost mode, you'll also get a Podcast Mode. We will say that we're not necessarily fans of the new addition \u2014 hosts' voices came through compressed, while background static felt more pronounced. Generally, this mode shone much better on the brand's Everboom speaker.\nHowever, the standard audio is good enough for listening to podcasts and music, so ignoring the new EQ feels like a fine concession. As with the Wonderboom 3, we found that overall, the sound profile is well-rounded and can get loud. We do wish that this speaker had been updated with a companion app for more customization.\nOn the bright side, it's very easy to plug, play, and now charge, thanks to the addition of a USB-C charging port. While it's not all that different from the Wonderboom 3, anyone who wants a no-frills speaker that sounds good will be happy with this one. The Wonderboom 4 is easy to find in stock and on sale, making it our updated pick for the best speaker under $100.\nDetails\nSonos Move 2\nBest home Bluetooth speaker\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Built-in smart features supporting Alexa\n- Great audio quality\n- Easy switch from WiFi to Bluetooth\n- 24 hours of battery\n- Pricey\n- Less portable than other Bluetooth speakers\n- No Google Assistant support\n- Historically hasn't gone on sale too often\nOur review\nRead our full review of the Sonos Move 2.\nWho it's for\nIf portability is at the top of your list when looking for a Bluetooth speaker, the Sonos Move 2 might not be for you. As Mashable's Stan Schroeder writes in his review, \"It sounds fantastic, but it's essentially a home speaker that also happens to be somewhat portable.\" However, if you want great sound, battery life, and smart features, this could be the best Bluetooth speaker for you. It's also the best choice for shoppers who already use other Sonos products in their home.\nWhy we picked this\nWe formerly recommended the original Sonos Move, but we like the newer version for its newly added stereo sound and 24 hours of battery life (as compared to the original's measly 11).\nTo be clear, this speaker isn't perfect, but we think the trade-offs balance out. For instance, you need a 3.5mm to USB-C adapter for line-in playback, but you can charge your phone from the Move 2's battery by connecting it with a USB-C cable (similar to the Charge 5). It isn't very portable for hikes or trips to the beach, but it's easy enough to move from the kitchen to the backyard (and has IP56 dust and water resistance), making it great for entertaining. It's also a great choice if you like using a speaker to listen to music around the house. While it doesn't work with Google Assistant, it does work great with Alexa.\nIt can burn through the battery life faster at higher volumes, but it gets plenty loud without sacrificing sound clarity. In essence, there are a few trade-offs you make with this speaker, but if you're looking for the best-sounding smart speaker, and the cons of this one don't clash with your needs, we think the Sonos Move 2 is a great pick.\nDetails\nSony ULT Field 3\nBest for bass lovers\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Lightweight and portable with detachable strap\n- Loud, room-filling sound\n- Dust-, rust-, shock-, and waterproof\n- Long playtimes with a battery-saving mode\n- Sound gets a big tinny at high volumes\n- Could use more practical features\nOur review\nRead our full review of the Sony ULT Field 3 speaker.\nWho it's for\nSony created the ULT line for bass heads who desire head-banging sonics from their portable speaker, and the recently launched ULT Field 3 delivers on that promise. This is a mid-range option with the low-end prowess of a premium model.\nWhy we picked this\nIf there is one area where Sony never misses, it\u2019s sound quality. Our audio expert, Alex Bracetti, previously tested and compared the ULT Field 3 with the Beats Pill across multiple categories, calling it an excellent upgrade to the well-received ULT Field 1.\nSony stuffed powerful audio components underneath the speaker\u2019s casually chic sheath, including one tweeter, one woofer, and dual-passive radiators that, in combination, deliver emphatic sound. The default EQ dishes strong bass, and enabling the ULT mode effectively raises it with minimal distortion, depending on the music track. There\u2019s even a Sound Field Optimization feature that auto-adjusts performance based on the noises around you, and it works well in all environments.\nGreat bass response isn\u2019t the only reason we\u2019re huge on the ULT Field 3. This speaker projects sound at a high range (up to 50 feet). Playtime is notably high, plus Sony\u2019s Battery Care function ensures long-term use out of the battery by capping recharges at 90 percent. Lastly, durable craftsmanship protects the speaker against many environmental hazards, letting you rock out anywhere without worrying about damage.\nDetails\nJBL Clip 5\nMost portable Bluetooth speaker\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Built-in carabiner is easy to use\n- Impressive volume, especially for the size\n- Slim and lightweight if you need to slip it in your bag\n- Sufficient playtime\n- Dust- and waterproof\n- Plenty of fun colorways to choose from\n- EQ is unavailable when using Auracast\n- Battery saving mode decreases sound quality\n- No voice assistance\nWho it's for\nThere are portable speakers, and then there are ultra-portable speakers truly designed to move with you. JBL\u2019s line of Clip speakers falls under the latter. The company\u2019s latest creation, the Clip 5, is a moderate upgrade to the highly recommended Clip 4 (which was previously on this list). Carrying it around is easy-peasy, thanks to the signature clip that attaches to anything, from backpacks to belt loops. Its blend of affordability, fine sound, and resilient build quality earns the Clip 5 mass appeal among budget-conscious shoppers seeking a high-quality everyday speaker for cheap.\nWhy we picked this\nHonestly, the clip-on design. JBL\u2019s built-in carabiner is a staple in the portable speaker category that is best executed on the Clip 5.\nWhile providing maximum portability and protection (IP67 dust- and waterproofing), this fifth-gen speaker has a fun factor that only a handful of other compact speakers can match. Its IP certification makes the Clip 5 a stellar shower companion, producing adequate clarity and enough oomph to wake you up during early bathing sessions. The customizable EQ and multiple presets are crucial for enhancing sound quality; adjusting the frequency levels helps balance output. Pairing two Clip 5 speakers together will open the door to stereo sound.\nThe Clip 5 has impressively loud volume that also diminishes mids and highs when raised all the way up. You can get better sound from other portable speakers, such as the UE Wonderboom 4 that costs about $30 more, but is well worth the pickup if audio is your priority. Otherwise, the Clip 5 is just as small, sturdy, and serviceable at a cheaper price.\nDetails\nAnker Soundcore Select 4 Go\nBest speaker under $50\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Vibrant audio with surprisingly strong bass response\n- Customizable EQ to personalize sound\n- Dust- and waterproof\n- Holds a charge longer than most luxury Bluetooth speakers\n- Built-in strap provides convenient portability\n- Limited feature set compared to other Anker speakers\n- No built-in power bank to charge devices\n- Lacks a speakerphone\nWho it's for\nIf you don\u2019t need expansive customization, or even crystal-clear sound, then go with what\u2019s considered the best portable speaker deal under $25 and $50: the Anker Soundcore Select 4 Go.\nWhy we picked this\nIt took a versatile competitor like Anker\u2019s entry-level speaker to overtake the JBL Go 4 as the category\u2019s top steal. The Select 4 Go does everything its low-priced rival does, plus it grants extended functionality via a mobile app, which the Go 4 lacks.\nPlaying songs on the Select 4 Go will reward you with enticing bass-forward sound that can be tweaked through Anker\u2019s customizable 9-band EQ or a handful of presets (Bass, Balanced, Signature, Treble). The Signature preset produces dynamic range, something that\u2019s unheard of for a speaker this low-priced, and the Balanced preset makes sound more natural. We\u2019ve found the Select 4 Go to be pleasantly resonant when jamming out to different music genres, from alternative rock to hip-hop to jazz. Don\u2019t confuse this for an audiophile speaker because it is far from that. The high-end isn\u2019t as transparent as we would like.\nAnother key area where the Select 4 Go proves its worth is portability. On top of being tiny, it\u2019s one tough-built speaker housed in sturdy plastic and covered in IP67 dust- and waterproofing. There is a built-in strap for attaching the speaker to a carry item via a carabiner. This serves bicyclists who choose to blast music from their backpacks when zipping through rush hour traffic or hikers needing an outdoor soundtrack to complete woodland expeditions. The 20 hours of playtime are also good for five days of moderate listening (four hours daily). It would have been nice if Anker designed the speaker to double as a portable bank for recharging media devices on the fly, but this isn\u2019t a dealbreaker for a speaker that's often on sale for $23.\nDetails\nMarshall Emberton III\nBest design\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Cool retro design\n- Three preset equalizer settings that sound noticeably different\n- Bluetooth connects and switches between devices easily\n- Long-lasting battery\n- App is easy to use but not necessary to have a good experience\n- Has a built-in mic if you want it\n- Supports Bluetooth LE and Auracast\n- No customizable equalizer\n- Audio isn't wildly better than speakers that are $50 cheaper\n- Not a true 360-degree sound profile\n- Voice equalizer preset made podcasts sound weirdly compressed\nWho it's for\nWhile we would never recommend a speaker solely on how it looks, we do care about the aesthetics of a speaker. If you've worked hard on decorating your space, then you deserve a speaker that will make its new home look even better.\nSo, for folks who appreciate good design, we recommend the new Marshall Emberton III. Not only does this premium Bluetooth speaker have Marshall's iconic vintage look, but it's also a solid-sounding speaker for its price point.\nWhy we picked this\nNo matter where we put the Emberton III \u2014 on a desk, the middle of a coffee table, a bookshelf, even the kitchen counter \u2014 it instantly elevated the vibe of the room. In all honesty, because it looks so good, we were a little skeptical that it would have the performance to match its pretty face.\nTo our surprise, the speaker did perform. Right out of the box, it produced clear and well-rounded sound. Though it had a slightly heavier-bass mix, it made Still Woozy's \"Get Down\" and Billie Holiday's \"Solitude\" sound equally as good. We wish it had a custom equalizer, but if you download the companion app, you can choose between the Marshall preset (the speaker's default sound), the Push preset that boosts bass and treble, and the Voice preset that enhances the mid-range for voice-focused content. The presets sounded markedly different, which isn't always the case with the audio devices we test. We wouldn't recommend the Voice preset, unfortunately. Like the podcast mode on the Wonderboom 4, this setting made podcast hosts' voices sound compressed and less clear.\nAs for the on-speaker features, a light indicates battery life and both the power and Bluetooth buttons make the speaker ultra-easy to turn on and pair \u2014 we never had to spend more than 10 seconds connecting or switching between devices. Finally, the speaker also comes with a unique knob in the center to toggle the volume and song selection. This worked fine, but the dial control might not be for everyone.\nMarshall promises a 32-hour battery life with this speaker, and after several days of medium to heavy use, the speaker still sat at about 60% battery life. With the app, you can also turn on battery preservation features to keep the charge going as long as possible.\nFor $169.99, it's a good, but not incredible, sounding speaker, but it more than makes up for its small drawbacks with a cool retro design. Released in August 2024, its feature set and design aren't that different from the Emberton II. So, if you want to save some money, you can pick up the Emberton II at a discount without sacrificing much sound quality.\nDetails\nIKEA VAPPEBY portable speaker\nBest for the absolute basics\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Impressive battery life\n- Very budget-friendly\n- Satisfactory volume, especially for price point\n- Compact\n- Cute design\n- Can do stereo sound with two speakers\n- IP67 water and dust proof rating\n- Charging cord and power adapter not included\n- Can lose sound clarity on certain genres\n- No on-speaker controls beyond on and off button\n- No cover for charging port\n- Can be finicky to reconnect if you try to pair to more than one device\nWho's it for\nIt's about as simple as a speaker can be, but for only $15, it does the job for someone just looking for the basics.\nWhy we picked this\nA Bluetooth speaker at this price point practically invites skepticism, but we tested it out for a few reasons: it's from IKEA (and not some random Amazon brand), had decent reviews on the retailer's website, and is one of the lowest priced speakers we've ever seen.\nSurprisingly, the VAPPEBY portable speaker did actually deliver. Sure, being only $15 means it does come with its shortcomings: it won't come with a charging cable or power adapter, it feels cheap and plasticky, and the audio quality suffers with music that's more mix-heavy (especially at higher volumes). Plus, the connection can be touch and go if you're not sticking to one device.\nHowever, it gets decently loud and isn't exorbitantly expensive, so you don't need to feel overly precious with it. The sound quality is acceptable to use as a simple desktop speaker, or one you can bring with you in the shower or to the beach without too much stress (helped by its IP67 water- and dust-proof rating).\nWith just one button to play music and power it on and off, IKEA really brings this speaker down to the basics. All in all, you'll get a speaker that's compact, cute, and keeps the features and price down to a minimum.\nDetails\nBeats Pill\nBest speakerphone\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Arguably the best call quality of any portable speaker\n- Massive sound upgrade from the original\n- Sleek handheld design built for travel\n- Lossless audio via USB-C connection\n- Increased battery life\n- Plenty of stylish colorways\n- No spatial audio\n- Metal grille is incredibly fragile\n- Weight is heavier than it looks\nWho it's for\nThe 2024 Beats Pill caters to two crowds: iPhone users locked into Apple\u2019s ecosystem who want to enjoy Apple Music the best way possible, and business buffs requiring a professional communication tool when on the road. This flagship speaker pleases both sides, especially the latter.\nWhy we picked this\nApple products have never done us wrong when it comes to call quality, and the company made sure this updated version of the Beats Pill didn\u2019t drop the ball. Hands-free voice calling is outstanding. The speaker\u2019s mic array demonstrates great speech recognition and vocal capture. Several of the voice and video chats we had both indoors and outdoors were loud and clear. Yes, the mics often picked up ambient sound that caused muffling, but callers on the opposite end were still able to make out sentences.\nThis level of performance carries over to voice assistance, a productivity feature that every Siri and Google Assistant user (the Pill is also optimized for Android) will love. Voice commands register accurately and execute as quickly as the speaker receives them.\nThe Pill\u2019s second-most valued trait is lossless audio. To enjoy this, you must connect the speaker to a compatible device (e.g., laptop, MP3 player, smartphone, tablet) via USB-C input. Doing this boosts clarity and depth when vibing out to favorited playlists on Apple Music, Spotify, and Tidal. Beats also deserves credit for redesigning its sound architecture to expand frequency range and keep bass at the forefront for well-balanced output.\nDetails\nUltimate Ears Hyperboom\nBest Bluetooth party speaker\nThe Good & The Bad\n- Very loud, bass-heavy performance\n- All-day long battery life\n- Nearly indestructible build quality\n- Adaptive EQ corrects sound based on your environment\n- Variety of handy features\n- Might be too loud for small spaces\n- No speakerphone or voice assistance\n- High volume drastically drains playtime\n- Expensive and heavy\nWho it's for\nWhether you\u2019re hosting company in the backyard or an open space inside the house, the UE Hyperboom is the party speaker you want on hand. Its dependable feature set, floor-rattling bass response, and weekend-length battery life meet the criteria for a banging celebration.\nWhy we picked this\nParty speakers are a growing field. While we\u2019re putting several new options through Mashable\u2019s extensive testing process, we can comfortably say that the Hyperboom is our current favorite for many reasons.\nFirst, sound quality. A portable speaker this colossal doesn\u2019t hold back on bass or volume. The Hyperboom blasts music as loud as any home entertainment system, shaking the floor and walls with intense reverberation, while producing low end that slaps harder than a reactive counterattack from Will Smith. Two 25-millimeter tweeters will do that. Bass is exaggerated, but UE developed an Adaptive EQ that uses a tiny microphone on the top to adjust sound in real time based on ambient noise. We noticed the feature improved mid and high frequencies. Toying with the EQ in UE\u2019s companion app helps increase clarity.\nNiche features like the aux and optical inputs transform the Hyperboom into a home speaker that blends nicely with your home entertainment setup. There are dual Bluetooth inputs to pair the speaker with two media devices simultaneously. That means one person can play the DJ and another can hijack the playlist with their own music requests without compromising performance. UE programmed the Hyperboom to pair with several of the brand\u2019s other mid- and high-range speakers, giving you full 360-degree stereo sound.\nThe Hyperboom is not an immaculate party speaker and is outdated in certain ways. Notice the lack of speakerphone and voice assistance. Keeping volume at about 60 percent is the safest way to protect one\u2019s hearing and preserve battery life. Furthermore, the speaker has a steep MSRP ($400) and weighs a lot (13 pounds). Still, it\u2019s an audio beast you\u2019ll need on hand to feed adrenaline-pumping sound to large crowds.\nDetails\nFrequently Asked Questions\nIf you're twisting our arm, we have to give it up to JBL. Not only have JBL speakers beaten brands like Sonos and Bose in Mashable's blind sound tests, but they're also on the more affordable side. That's a hard combo to beat. However, several brands are popular in the Bluetooth speaker market. Consumer favorites include Anker, Beats, JBL, Sony, and Ultimate Ears. Certain upscale audio brands like Bang & Olufsen and Bose continue to build out their collections with notable releases. Even low-cost speaker manufacturers like Treblab and Tribit are making noise with some of their inexpensive entries.\nIt's hard to say one brand's speakers are definitively the best, especially because the right pick for you will depend heavily on your budget. Obviously, you shouldn't expect a $40 speaker to sound the same as our current top pick, the $199 JBL Charge 6. That doesn't mean you have to blow out your budget to get high-quality sound. What we can say is that certain brands tend to be popular for a reason.\nFor our guide, we put together the standouts from each brand. All of the speakers we chose offer good value, portability, smart home compatibility, and durability. Most importantly, they sound terrific, with satisfying bass and fidelity.\nNot really, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to have this protection. You\u2019ll want to own a waterproof speaker if you plan on playing music at the beach, pool, or in your shower. It's not out of the question that your speaker could be a target for spills in the house. So, if you have the option to go waterproof (and you do), do it. It\u2019s also worth educating yourself on ingress protection (IP) ratings to know the difference between each. Here is a breakdown below.\nIPX0 \u2013 No water resistance\nIPX1 \u2013 Survives vertical drip of 1 millimeter of water\nIPX2 \u2013 Survives drip of 3 millimeters of water\nIPX3 \u2013 Survives light water spraying\nIPX4 \u2013 Survives omnidirectional water splashing (water resistant)\nIPX5 \u2013 Survives water jet splashing up to 12.5 liters for 1 min\nIPX6 \u2013 Survives water jet splashing up to 100 liters for 3 mins\nIPX7 \u2013 Complete submersion up to 1 meter for 30 mins\nIPX8 \u2013 Complete submersion up to 3 meters for 30 minutes\nWhen you're shopping for a new speaker, you're going to see the word \"wattage\" a lot. While that might be meaningless to you when you see it on a product page, it's actually a pretty simple concept. Basically, wattage refers to how loud your speaker can get without distorting the sound. Unless you enjoy really blasting your tunes or you regularly host parties, 50 watts is going to be more than enough for the average listener. But if you do like to crank it up to 11, the more watts, the merrier. While smaller portable Bluetooth speakers tend to have lower wattage, there are certainly some exceptions, including some of the products in this guide.\nOur motto is quality over quantity. Having one amazing speaker is going to get you better sound than having multiple speakers that are just OK. If you\u2019re fine with listening to music in a single room or plan on entertaining small crowds, then one speaker will suffice for mono presentation. Just make sure the environment has good acoustics. If you\u2019re hosting larger crowds in larger settings or want a more immersive listening experience, then the way to go is pairing two of the same speakers (or speakers from the same brand) for stereo sound. Some models even let you pair up to 100 speakers at once to create full omnidirectional sound.\nNo. Some Bluetooth speakers are WiFi speakers. Not all WiFi speakers are Bluetooth speakers. Basically, a Bluetooth speaker connects to devices through (what else) Bluetooth, which is the most common wireless technology for the product category. WiFi speakers connect to devices through a reliable internet connection, making it a more appealing option for those with an integrated smart home ecosystem (e.g., Apple, Google, Sonos).\nEssentially, yes. It\u2019s all a matter of what audio codecs your speaker supports. AAC and SBC are the two most common codecs you\u2019ll find on current portable Bluetooth speakers. There are some speakers that come with stronger codecs like LDAC to stream music at high-res 24bit/96kHz. All that means is you\u2019ll hear more detail and nuance from recordings at a higher transmission. Something else to look for is LE Audio-ready speakers, which improve audio streaming at lower latency. Your speaker should run Bluetooth 5.2 or higher. Anything less than that could affect what you hear. The higher the Bluetooth version, the stronger the connection and streaming quality.\nBethany Allard is a Los Angeles-based shopping reporter at Mashable covering beauty tech, dating, sex and relationships, and headphones.

      "text": "Sony's new flagship XM6 headphones are here \u2014 but there's a catch\nTable of Contents\nOn May 15, Sony released its newest flagship headphones, the noise-cancelling WH-1000XM6 headphones. The new headphones have improved noise cancellation and sound, but there's a catch \u2014 they cost $449.99. That's about $50 more than the previous version, and hardly a surprise in the tariff era. Still, that's a big ask for music lovers.\nAs I noted in my full review, \"other flagship headphones from brands like Bose, Dyson, Sonos, and Apple have all come in at $449 and above. If you're a music lover who wants the best possible sound, that's the new price of admission, folks.\"\nMashable has been testing the new wireless headphones over the past couple weeks, and you can read our full review of the new cans (spoiler alert: they sound fantastic). But if you're ready to pass go, drop $450, and collect your new headphones, you can already purchase them at Sony, Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers.\nSony's flagship headphones always rank among the very best noise-cancelling headphones, and the XM6 are no exception. In this post, we'll cover what's new, what's not, and other need-to-know details on the latest Sony noise cancellers.\nMeet the new XM6 headphones: The specs\nYou can't release a new product in 2025 without adding some type of AI feature, even if you have to use the term AI liberally. However, Sony really did add a faster chip (seven times faster, the company says), the Sony QN3 processor. That chip powers improved noise cancellation, particularly for phone calls. The other improvements definitely fall into the iterative category, with one big exception: these headphones now fold.\nAnd here are the specs:\nProcessor: Sony QN3\nMicrophones: 12\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5.3 (LDAC support)\nBattery: 30 hours with ANC (40 hours without)\nNoise cancellation: Active noise cancellation\nSpatial audio: Yes\nColors: Midnight blue, black, silver\nThe Sony XM6 Headphones: What's new?\nFor the new headphones, Sony audio engineers worked with mastering engineers here in the United States to improve the overall audio quality. And when directly comparing them to the XM5 headphones and wireless earbuds, there is a noticeable improvement. (How much better? Read our full XM6 review to find out.)\nFor call quality, additional microphones and \"AI beamforming\" provide clearer, more directional sound. For calls, the headphones also feature two additional microphones.\nMost importantly, the new headphones are more travel-friendly. The case is slimmer and smaller than the XM5 case. They also trade the terrible, easily broken zipper for a magnetic latch. While the case might not look much smaller, in person, it's significantly more compact. And here's the big news: The headphones now fold up for storage.\nThe XM6 Headphones: What's not new?\nWhile Dyson's OnTrac headphones were able to achieve a mighty impressive 55 hours of battery with ANC, the XM6 headphones have exactly the same battery life as the previous model. That's pretty disappointing. (Though, unless you're taking back-to-back 20-hour flights, I'm not sure anyone really needs more than 30 hours of playback at a time.) I would also class the noise cancellation and audio improvements as a matter of degrees, not miles. Considering it's been three years since the previous model, I was hoping for a little more.\nHonestly, it's looking like noise-cancelling headphones like this have pretty much plateaued. Just look at the non-existent changes Apple made to the \"new\" AirPods Max headphones. At least Sony included noticeable audio quality improvements, a new processor, and a big new design change.\nWhere to buy the Sony XM6 Headphones\nIf you've been eagerly waiting for Sony's new headphones, you can order them now from Sony, Amazon, and Best Buy. The headphones have a $449.99 price tag and come in three colors, Midnight blue, black, and silver.\nTimothy Beck Werth is the Tech Editor at Mashable, where he leads coverage and assignments for the Tech and Shopping verticals.

      "text": "AirPods Pro 3 seemingly confirmed in Apple leak\nA new Apple leak suggests AirPods Pro 3 earbuds could drop soon.\nAs 9to5Mac reported, new info surfaced on X earlier this week that suggested Apple was working on the next generation of AirPods Pro. Aaron Perris, an Apple-focused analyst, posted a bit of code that suggests Apple is actively prepping for the third generation of AirPods Pro.\nThis Tweet is currently unavailable. It might be loading or has been removed.\nThe code Perris posted shows a task for \"AirPods Pro 2nd Generation\" that now reads for \"AirPods Pro 2 or later,\" which suggests there is a third generation in the works. Mashable hasn't been able to independently verify the screenshot, but we are overdue for new Pro earbuds. The latest AirPods Pro 2 launched back in 2022, with a USB-C-charging version introduced in 2023. Despite their age, Mashable has consistently rated the Pros as some of the best wireless earbuds.\nApple fans are hoping this means we'll get a surprise announcement of the AirPods Pro 3 during June's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event. While it's possible we get the new headphones at WWDC, it is far from a guarantee. Both previous models of the AirPods Pro were announced in the fall, and Apple does tend to keep to a schedule. Still, the bit of code does suggest the third-gen Pros are in the works.\nAnd it's not like WWDC will be without news. It's a near certainty we'll get iOS 19 in June, and it's rumored to be a huge overhaul. So while you may have to wait a while for new AirPods Pro earbuds, there should be plenty of updates from Apple-land in the meantime.\nTim Marcin is an Associate Editor on the culture team at Mashable, where he mostly digs into the weird parts of the internet.
