  "content": "A young man in Ohio ran, swam and biked a triathlon last weekend in nothing but a tight pair of jorts he was forced into wearing after losing a bet \u2014 and still came in second place.\n\nJames Miller, a first-time triathlete, came to the fifth annual Tri CLE Rock Roll Run triathlon complete with the most uncomfortable outfit anyone could wear while sprinting, swimming and cycling in the hot summer sun. While he wore the Daisy Dukes with pride, it wasn\u2019t by choice, according to News 5 Cleveland.\n\nMiller and his friend, Luke Kim, made the fateful bet at a Cleveland Cavaliers game in February to raise the stakes in staying on track with their fitness goals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re like, let\u2019s set a goal. Let\u2019s actually be accountable to each other and let\u2019s actually set out to, you know, be better, right?\u201d Miller told the local outlet.\n\nThe duo decided to make an enticing bet: whoever did the fewest push-ups, pull-ups and shortest wall-sit during an agreed-upon competition judged by their Bible Study friends would have to run the triathlon in denim shorts \u2014 all but guaranteeing the loser a painful few hours of chafing.\n\nMiller and Kim put their all into training and, eventually, tested their mettle in front of the unflinching judges.\n\nKim came out on top, beating Miller\u2019s 5-minute wall-sit and sum-odd 50 push-ups.\n\nMiller kept up his end of the bet and even trained for the triathlon in uncomfortable athletic shorts so that running in jean cut-offs the day of would be a little more bearable.\n\nClearly, his training paid off as he cut past a majority of participants and landed in second place overall.\n\nAt the end of the race, Miller stood proudly beside his supportive friends, beaming in his soaked jorts \u2014 and shiny new medal.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very easy to look at a challenge like this and [be] like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m not going to do this.\u2019 But for me, I think that\u2019s something that, especially, you know, in our culture, we need to continue to build on,\u201d Miller said of sticking to one\u2019s word.",

      "text": "CLEVELAND \u2014 The Tri CLE Rock Roll Run triathlon returned to Cleveland this weekend for its fifth year, and one athlete introduced a fashion first.\nJames Miller, a Cleveland man and first-time triathlete, made his debut in Sunday's Super Sprint event, swimming, biking and running-all while wearing jean shorts. The reason? Accountability and a drive for self-improvement.\nIt all started at a Cleveland Cavaliers game in February, when Miller and his friend, Luke Kim, decided they needed a little extra motivation to achieve their fitness goals.\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a Cavs game in the middle of February, and we were kind of just struggling to make goals,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBut we\u2019re like, let\u2019s set a goal. Let\u2019s actually be accountable to each other and let\u2019s actually set out to, you know, be better, right?\u201d\nThe contest was simple. Miller and Kim would compete against each other to see who could do the most push-ups, pull-ups and wall-sits. Two of their friends from their Bible Study group, Brandon Deuch and Aaron Yeh, acted as judges. Another one of their friends who judged the competition was not able to attend the interview.\n\u201cI was absolutely blown away by how well both of them did,\u201d Deuch said. \u201cLike, James may have lost, but he did, I don\u2019t know, probably like somewhere in the 50s range of push-ups, over a five-minute wall sit, like it was just super.\u201d\nYeh agreed.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t emphasize enough that the effort and the commitment and the dedication from these guys was really impressive,\" said Yeh. \u201cEspecially considering this was, you know, not something that was mandated by any authority.\u201d\nKim, who won the competition, lauded it as a motivator that got him working out more consistently.\n\u201cI think having just accountability, whether it's another friend knowing that they're also working towards the same goal or another friend encouraging each other, even if the encouragement is through like smack talk and stuff like that, I think it's extremely helpful,\u201d Kim said.\nGoing back to their Bible Study roots, Kim related his experience to a bible verse encouraging fellowship with others.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s like \u2018As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.\u2019 And so, in that respect, I firmly believe that,\u201d Kim said.\nEven though Deuch and Yeh did not participate in the fitness challenge, they also spoke to the value of friends supporting friends in their goals.\n\u201cI would say in general, from my experience, like doing anything with the group of people, specifically your friends, makes it just so much easier,\u201d Deuch said. \u201cSo much more motivating.\u201d\n\u201cJust having these guys consistently... meeting and spending time with one another and encouraging each other makes all the difference in the world when it comes to being healthy and building good habits\u2014 just improving every day,\u201d said Yeh.\nThe triathlon was chosen for its accessibility, as it features shorter and longer distance events. According to a press release sent earlier in the summer, Tri CLE Rock Roll Run hosts youth and adult participants as young as 13 with male, female, and non-binary categories.\n\u201cThe distance does make it more accessible,\u201d Yeh said. \u201cThe punishment here more is in the wearing the jeans, and I don\u2019t think any of us would be ready for that sort of situation because no one, nobody knows what it\u2019s going to be like.\u201d\nOn Thursday, I asked Miller what he thought it was going to be like.\n\u201cHonestly, I think it\u2019s going to be painful, but I think I\u2019m ready for it,\u201d Miller said, though he also added he\u2019d done some extra training in less-than-comfortable athletic shorts to prepare.\nRegardless of the discomfort, Miller was determined to follow through on his word.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very easy to look at a challenge like this and like, \u2018Hey I'm not going to do this,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cBut for me, I think that\u2019s something that, especially, you know, in our culture, we need to continue to build on.\u201d\nMiller ended up finishing second overall in the super sprint race.\nJessica Yeager, the volunteer and community outreach director for Tri CLE Rock Roll Run, said the event features over 1000 participants and over 150 volunteers and that she was excited to see James among that number this year.\n\u201cWe at Tri CLE so much love to build community and involve the community around us and so I think it\u2019s so wonderful to see a group of young men motivating each other in such a healthy way,\u201d Yeager said."

Check in on your neighbors and loved ones, especially older adults, and seek out emergency assistance if needed. I am thankful to our first responders, law enforcement partners, social services workers, and neighbors who are lending a helping hand during a challenging time. We will get through this together, Milwaukee.\u201d\nWisconsin State Fair organizers canceled the final day of the event after heavy rain flooded the fairgrounds in West Allis, closing busy roadways and forcing some motorists to abandon vehicles as thousands lost power.\n\u201cWe are saddened we cannot deliver this final day of the Wisconsin State Fair, but know that this is the best decision with current conditions and the forecast ahead,\u201d organizers said in a statement.\nStartling videos and images showed vehicles trapped in the floodwaters at the fair as Wisconsinites desperately tried to flee the state fair, with their hoods and umbrellas up as they waded through 4-inch-deep puddles.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to need, possibly, some federal assistance,\u201d he said at a Sunday briefing, adding that Wisconsin Gov.
