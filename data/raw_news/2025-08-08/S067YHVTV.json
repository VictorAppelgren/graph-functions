  "description": "A new lawsuit claims that police officers were negligent while a man lay dying in back of the patrol car.",
  "content": "A police officer is accused of sending intimate texts and watching TikTok videos while a man suffering from a mental health crisis overdosed in the backseat of his police cruiser.\n\nNathan Bradford Smith, 33, died last July after he was arrested by the Coos Bay Police Department in Oregon for disorderly conduct while appearing to be high on methamphetamine, according to a lawsuit filed on behalf of his family.\n\nOfficers interacted with Smith twice that day before they discovered him lying on the sidewalk in front of a Motel 6.\n\nThe first time was around 11 am when they took Smith's meth pipe, and the second was around 3 pm when they responded to a report that he was screaming outside of a business and scaring customers.\n\nOfficers Benjamin Martin, Tristan Smith, and Wesley O\u2019Connor came in contact with the man a third time when he was lying on a sidewalk in front of the motel around 5 pm.\n\nAttorneys representing Smith's family argue that body camera footage shows that responding officers treated him 'aggressively' even though he didn't resist arrest.\n\nO'Connor is heard over the radio stating, 'Get your hand away from me you weirdo,' during the arrest.\n\nO'Connor was also seen putting his weight on Smith's left shoulder and grabbing his left wrist during the arrest.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses the officers of neglecting Smith's mental state and arresting him instead.\n\nSmith struggled to move his body, and his breath was rapid and exaggerated when he entered the police vehicle, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe officers are accused of not providing medical care to Smith while he was gasping for air with his eyes closed in the backseat.\n\nDash camera footage showed Smith slumping in the backseat of the car. When Martin arrived at the police department, he allegedly sprayed his vehicle with air freshener and abandoned Smith in the car with the windows closed.\n\n'While in CBPD headquarters, Defendant [Martin] scrolled on his phone, reviewed and responded to intimate text messages, and looked at TikTok for several minutes,' the lawsuit states.\n\nAs the officer allegedly scrolled on his phone inside the department, Smith was 'shaking uncontrollably and gasping for breath' in the vehicle.\n\nOfficer Martin scrolled through TikTok and responded to a text message that read, 'I\u2019m so ready for snuggles I feel like i haven\u2019t seen you in a week,' Oregon Live reported, citing a police report.\n\nMartin then checked on Smith in the vehicle and found him unconscious. He then allegedly performed 'sternal rubs' and administered Narcan.\n\nAbout 20 minutes after Smith was first placed in the vehicle, ambulances arrived and treated him on the scene before departing for a local hospital.\n\nLess than 45 minutes later, Smith died after a cardiac arrest. His cause of death was listed as hyperthermia due to meth intoxication and wearing multiple layers of heavy clothing.\n\nThe hospital where Smith died was under two miles from where he was arrested, but the police officers decided to take him in the opposite direction to the department.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that police officers delayed getting Smith medical care for over 40 minutes, which was a crucial lapse in time that ultimately led to his death.\n\nSmith's family argues that officers could've saved his life had they taken him straight to the hospital instead of leaving him in the backseat alone in a police vehicle.\n\n'In his final moments in Defendant Martin\u2019s vehicle, gasping for air while Defendant Martin scrolled TikTok, Mr. Smith was clearly suffering physically, mentally, and emotionally. His death from hyperthermia likely caused him great physical pain and distress,' the lawsuit states.\n\nThe three officers are facing claims of negligence and the abuse of a vulnerable person.\n\nDaily Mail reached out to the Coos Bay Department Chief of Police for comment on the lawsuit and additional information on the officers' current employment.\n\nSmith's father, Kurt, told Oregon Live that police came to his work to notify him of his son's death.\n\nHe added that police didn't share the circumstances of how his son died but instead he was forced to learn about the cause of death from the funeral home.\n\nIn an investigative report, Martin claimed that there were 'no officers available to monitor Nathan' while he was inside the station, and he left him in the vehicle to call another officer during a shift change.\n\n'This lawsuit shines a light on the police's inappropriate responses to people in health emergencies,' Hannah Bland, a staff attorney with the Civil Rights Project, who is representing Smith's family, told Daily Mail.\n\n'These officers are first responders and yet they neglected their duty to get Mr. Smith\u2014a person in their custody\u2014to the hospital when he was exhibiting clear signs of medical distress.\n\n'Instead of calling for an ambulance, Officer Martin spent this crucial time scrolling TikTok while Mr. Smith was overheating and gasping for air in the back of his police car.'",

  "argos_summary": "A lawsuit has been filed against three Coos Bay police officers after Nathan Bradford Smith died in their custody during a mental health crisis. The officers allegedly neglected Smith's medical needs while one officer, Benjamin Martin, is accused of scrolling through TikTok and sending intimate texts instead of providing assistance. Smith was left gasping for air in the back of a police cruiser for over 40 minutes before receiving medical attention, which his family claims contributed to his death from hyperthermia.",
