  "description": "Another lawsuit is coming",
  "content": "\u2022 Apple Watch fans are due to get the blood oxygen feature back on certain watches, after a lawsuit by health tech company Masimo\n\u2022 The feature now involves a slight workaround, in which the measurement can only be displayed on an iPhone\n\u2022 Masimo is suing the U.S. Customs Department for allowing the workaround to go ahead\n\nApple Watch users in the US are finally about to get a health feature back, as the watchOS 26 public beta launched with access to the blood oxygen feature \u2013 sort of.\n\nThe feature was removed for US fans after health technology company Masimo sued Apple, claiming it willfully violated Masimo's intellectual property by way of its patented blood oxygen feature. As a result, the feature was temporarily disabled on the Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Series 10, and Apple Watch Ultra 2.\n\nHowever, a workaround meant that the Apple Watch was able to add the feature back in via its new watchOS 26 software, and it's already arrived on some watches participating in the Apple public beta program.\n\nThe workaround is that while the Apple Watch can record blood oxygen, it can only present that information in the Health app on an iPhone.\n\nMasimo doesn't like this and has filed another lawsuit \u2013 this time targeting US Customs, rather than Apple itself. Masimo is suing the US government for (according to the lawsuit via this BGR report), \"unlawfully let[ting] Apple Inc. reactivate a blood-oxygen tracking feature on Apple Watches that infringes patents for the technology\".\n\nWill I get blood oxygen tracking on my Apple Watch?\n\nWe don't know. At the moment, if you're signed up to the public beta program, you should already have the feature.\n\nWhether it will survive until the wider rollout in September, or whether the US government will feel pressured by this suit to take action and ban the workaround, remains to be seen.\n\nYou might also like...\n\u2022 Garmin watches could finally get a key feature Apple's had for years \u2013 here's why it matters\n\u2022 I review fitness trackers for a living \u2013 here's the best one I've tried in 2025\n\u2022 The Apple Watch may get a major redesign \u2013 but not in time for the Apple Watch 11",

      "text": "Blood Oxygen tracking is back on the Apple Watch \u2013 but it's now a two-device experience\n- Following an 18-month ban, Blood Oxygen tracking is coming back to the Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2\n- It's not an entirely on-device experience anymore, though\n- The Apple Watch still measures Blood Oxygen, but the iPhone will calculate and display the final result\nIt\u2019s been a long 18 months, but Apple\u2019s announced that Blood Oxygen tracking and monitoring are returning to the Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2 in the United States.\nThe feature was disabled and effectively banned on the Series 9 and Ultra 2 \u2013 then the Series 10, which launched later \u2013 after a ruling in January 2024 due to a patent dispute over the technology being used between Massimo and Apple. Now, thanks to iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1, which will roll out later today, the feature is returning in a \u2018redesigned\u2019 form.\nIn its new iteration, the Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2\u2019s sensors can take a reading, then transmit the data to the connected iPhone, where it will be calculated and displayed in the Health app under \u2018Respiratory\u2019 readings.\nSo no, you won\u2019t be able to take the reading, watch as it progresses, and then view the results right on your wrist, as you could before. Still, this does effectively return the tracking and monitoring functionality to the impacted Apple Watch models in the United States.\nIn a statement shared, Apple explains the changes as:\n\u201cUsers with these models in the U.S. who currently do not have the Blood Oxygen feature will have access to the redesigned Blood Oxygen feature by updating their paired iPhone to iOS 18.6.1, and their Apple Watch to watchOS 11.6.1. Following this update, sensor data from the Blood Oxygen app on Apple Watch will be measured and calculated on the paired iPhone, and results can be viewed in the Respiratory section of the Health app. This update was enabled by a recent U.S. Customs ruling.\u201d\nThe U.S. Customs ruling is key here, as this will return the feature to the Apple Watches sold when the ban began and was subsequently enforced. If you still have an older Apple Watch, or one sold prior to January 2024, the Blood Oxygen functionality remains unimpacted and won\u2019t be changed. That also goes for any models sold outside of the United States, which have been unimpacted by this ruling.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nStill, this does return the Blood Oxygen feature to the Apple Watch, even if it splits the experience between watch and phone. But this separation is likely key to having this allowed and approved by U.S. Customs.\nFor those who have purchased an Apple Watch Series 9, 10, or Ultra 2 in those many months, this is a return to form and rounding out of the health tracking features on Apple\u2019s star wearable in the United States. Even in our Apple Watch Series 10 review, we noted that the Blood Oxygen tracking feature was missing in the US.\nApple has a pretty smart rollout here, and considering rumors of further pushes into health features that we might see with future generations of Apple Watch models, it might be helpful to have these readings going straight into the Health app. Either route, though, if you\u2019ve been waiting for Blood Oxygen tracking to return, it\u2019s back, but you\u2019ll want to make sure your iPhone is nearby if you want to see the results.\nWhile Apple has not shared an exact timing for the rollouts of iOS 18.6.1 and watchOS 11.6.1, it has promised to arrive today \u2013 August 14, 2025 \u2013 in the United States, and we\u2019ll update this piece when we see it rolling out.\nYou might also like\nJacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

      "text": "Masimo Takes U.S. Customs To Court Over Restored Apple Watch Blood Oxygen\nFollowing a decision that offered Apple a way to bring its Apple Watch blood oxygen tool back in the U.S., Bloomberg reports that Masimo alleges U.S. Customs and Border Protection \"unlawfully let Apple Inc. reactivate a blood-oxygen tracking feature on Apple Watches that infringes patents for the technology,\" according to a suit filed in federal court.\nWith that, Masimo wants a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction from the court to halt Apple's blood oxygen feature on its Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Series 10, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 models.\n\"Each passing day that this unlawful ruling remains in effect irreparably deprives Masimo of its right to be free from unfair trade practices and to preserve its competitive standing in the U.S. marketplace,\" said Masimo. We now need to wait for the court to decide whether Masimo's allegations mean Apple needs to remove this feature once again, or if the U.S. Customs and Border Protection decision was correct.\nApple might rely on blood oxygen tool to expand other health technologies\nMasimo accuses Apple of infringing U.S. patents number 10,912,502 and 10,945,648 regarding non-invasive pulse oximetry. If the court decides to reinstate the previous decision, Apple still has a pending appeal at the Federal Circuit.\nIf that turns out to be the case, another option would be to wait until 2028 so the company would be able to reinstate the technology again, as the patent will have expired. That said, this could limit Apple's capabilities to release new features, such as the long-rumored blood pressure monitor.\nWith plans to implement more advanced health sensors in the coming years, getting a feature shutdown that had been available since the Apple Watch Series 6 would mean the company would have to delay some of its best features on its most important product lineup. At this moment, we haven't heard from Apple, Masimo, or the U.S. CPB, but we'll update the story when we do."

      "text": "Apple Watch leak suggests it could soon get a sleep-tracking upgrade it should have had years ago\n- Apple could add a sleep score in a future Apple Watch update\n- It could measure your sleep stages, temperature, and more\n- We don\u2019t know when \u2013 or if \u2013 this feature will be added to watchOS\nThe best Apple Watches can track many things, including several different aspects of your nighttime slumber. But one thing they can\u2019t do right now is provide you with a score that indicates the quality of your sleep. Yet according to a leaked graphic, that\u2019s something that might soon be coming to Apple\u2019s wearable.\nThat information was discovered by writer Steve Moser, who dredged up a graphic named \u201cWatch Focus Score\u201d from deep within the code of Apple\u2019s Health app (via MacRumors). The combination of the image\u2019s name and its contents might imply that Apple is working on a new sleep score feature for watchOS.\nThe picture depicts an Apple Watch with the number 84 in the center of its display. This number is surrounded by three bars that curve to form a circle. Interestingly, the bars are colored red, light blue and purple, and these tones correspond to the sleep stages shown in the Health app (there, red indicates time awake, light blue means REM sleep, and purple means deep sleep. The app also uses dark blue for core sleep, which could be what the graphic is showing).\nThe number and colored bars might hint at an overall score that takes into account the different sleep stages and how much of each you got at night. That would provide an extra level of data that you don\u2019t currently find in watchOS.\nMore than just sleep stages?\nBut there are indications that other factors could be considered for this score. In Apple\u2019s graphic, the Apple Watch is flanked on both sides by various icons, including a moon at stars, a \u201czzz,\u201d a bed, and an alarm clock. Right now, Apple uses the bed icon for the sleep focus mode, while the alarm clock may signify when your alarm went off or when you got out of bed.\nMoser also spotted a thermometer icon, which could be a hint that Apple will take more than just sleep stages into account when calculating a sleep score. It might incorporate wrist temperature as an indicator of your health, for example, and there may be other as-yet-unknown metrics that are also included as part of the overall score.\nIf this sleep score feature becomes a reality, Apple will be far from the first smartwatch maker to include it in their products: both Fitbit and Garmin have included sleep scores in their devices for years.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nBut Apple fans won\u2019t mind that if they do indeed get this functionality in a future update \u2013 you never know, it might come to watchOS 26 later this year.\nYou might also like\nAlex Blake has been fooling around with computers since the early 1990s, and since that time he's learned a thing or two about tech.

      "text": "The watchOS 26 public beta is imminent \u2013 here are 5 great free upgrades every Apple Watch will get, plus 4 you could miss out on\nIf you want all the features, here's your sign to upgrade\niOS 26 is imminent and is expected to come to public beta very soon. While we\u2019re excited to see how Apple\u2019s biggest software update will upgrade the iPhone experience, Apple Watches will also be getting the same treatment when watchOS 26 is rolled out, and we're just as excited.\nIf you own an Apple Watch Series 6 or later, an Apple Watch SE 2, or any Apple Watch Ultra model, then you\u2019ll be able to reap the benefits of watchOS 26\u2019s exciting new features. However, it does come with some setbacks.\nThough the models mentioned above will receive a lot of handy new functions, there are four watchOS 26 features that will only be available to use on the Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Series 10, and Apple Watch Ultra models only \u2013 leaving owners of older models in the dust.\nIt\u2019s best to double-check and see what watchOS 26 features your current Apple Watch model will support when the update is rolled out in September. If you want to make the most of more advanced features, take this as your sign to upgrade in time for watchOS 26.\n4 features your older Apple Watch won\u2019t get\nThe following features will be available on Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Series 10, and Apple Watch Ultra models only.\n1. Wrist Flick\nIn 2023, Apple rolled out the Double Tap gesture for the Apple Watch, a multi-functional feature that allows you to do things such as close Smart Stack, begin workouts, silence alarms and timers, and dismiss notifications.\nApple\u2019s Wrist Flick function is a new hands-free gesture designed to carry out similar functions which sounds a lot more reliable than Double Tap, but only the Apple Watch models mentioned above will be able to support this.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\n2. Smart Replies updates\nWhile it doesn\u2019t matter which iPhone model you have (as long as it supports the latest version of iOS), you\u2019ll still need one of the newer Apple Watch models to make the most of watchOS 26\u2019s upgrade to Smart Replies, which offers more precise and contextually-relevant messaging suggestions.\n3. Automatic volume adjustment\nSimilarly to Wrist Flick, automatic volume adjustment won\u2019t be coming to models released pre-2023. This is a little disappointing, as it sounds like it would be a very handy function when it comes to managing noisy notifications.\nWith this new watchOS 26 feature, your Apple Watch will have the ability to \u2018automatically adjust the speaker volume based on the ambient noise in a user\u2019s surroundings for notifications, timers, alarms, incoming calls, and Siri\u2019 \u2013 as it states in Apple\u2019s press release.\n4. Live Translation\nOne of the biggest iOS 26 upgrades announced at WWDC 2025 was the addition of Apple Intelligence\u2019s Live Translation function for iPhone, and now certain Apple Watch models are getting the same treatment.\nWith the arrival of watchOS 26, you\u2019ll be able to view these right from your wrist \u2013 that\u2019s if you own an Apple Watch Series 9, Apple Watch Series 10, or an Apple Watch Ultra 2.\n5 features your older Apple Watch will receive\nIf you have an Apple Watch Series 6 or later, or an Apple Watch SE 2, look out for these new features when watchOS 26 rolls out.\n1. Liquid Glass\nLiquid Glass is one of the biggest upgrades coming with watchOS 26 \u2013 a huge operating system design upgrade that will roll out across all of Apple\u2019s hardware. Not only will it give your interface a transparent and glossy look, but will make the use of small spaces by using expanding widgets.\nThe best part about this? You won\u2019t have to worry about upgrading to a newer Apple Watch model for this new look, as it\u2019s coming to Apple Watch Series 6 or later, Apple Watch SE 2, and all Apple Watch Ultra models.\n2. Apple Intelligence Workout Buddy\nwatchOS 26 is also getting some upgrades on the fitness front, the main new addition being the Workout Buddy function. Powered by Apple Intelligence, Workout Buddy is a new experience in the Workout app that accesses the user's fitness, health, and workout history to provide spoken motivation and personalized fitness summaries.\nYou should note that to take advantage of Workout Buddy, you\u2019ll also need an iPhone capable of supporting Apple Intelligence \u2013 those being models that support iOS 18.4 and later.\n3. Notes on wrist\nOne of the most asked-for features is the addition of the Notes app to watchOS, and if you have an Apple Watch Series 6 or above, you\u2019ll soon be able to use Notes right from your wrist as nature intended.\nNot only will you be able to access existing notes made on your iPhone, watchOS 26 will allow you to create new ones from your Apple Watch using Siri, dictation, and the keyboard function \u2013 and even complete checklists. Your grocery list can now live on your wrist!\n4. Watch face \u2018Hints\u2019 in the Smart Stack\nWith watchOS 26, new visual prompts called \u2018Hints\u2019 are coming to the watch face Smart Stack, which appears when you use the Digital Crown on the side of your watch to scroll.\nApple says Hints are designed to make your everyday interactions more convenient, offering the following examples of what to expect from its new addition: \u2018A hint for Backtrack may appear when a user is in a remote location with no connectivity, or a hint for a Pilates workout may show up when a user arrives at a studio location at their usual time\u2019.\n5. Third-party control functions\nThe final new feature coming to the wider group of watchOS 26-compatible models are new third-party controls, which will allow developers to create their own custom controls that Apple Watch users can add to their Control Center, Smart Stack widget, or Action Button.\nWhen editing your Control Center, your Apple Watch will also show a \u2018From your iPhone\u2019 section, which will then allow you to add third-party controls found in your iPhone.\nYou might also like...\n- The iOS 26 public beta could arrive this week, bringing Liquid Glass and more to your iPhone\n- Apple quietly reveals CarPlay's big video upgrade in iOS 26, but there's a catch\n- The latest iPhone 17 Air battery leak is a worrying one \u2013 but iOS 26 could help\nRowan is an Editorial Associate and Apprentice Writer for TechRadar.

These additional sensors may form part of the redesign.\nIn the past we've heard rumors of an Apple Watch with a camera and an Apple Watch with a touch-sensitive glass frame, but these potential upgrades aren't specifically mentioned in the latest reporting from DigiTimes.\nBattery boost\nThe new article also mentions improved power efficiency too, which hopefully means we can look forward to better battery life with the Apple Watch 12, and perhaps the Apple Watch Ultra 4 (the Apple Watch Ultra 3 should arrive this year).\nIn terms of this year's model, the report does say that the Apple Watch 11 will be getting some Apple Intelligence features. However, based on what we've seen of watchOS 26, it seems likely that these will mostly be managed on a connected iPhone.\nGiven what DigiTimes is predicting for 2026, it seems the Apple Watch 11 might be a more minor upgrade.

      "text": "I review fitness trackers for a living \u2013 here's the best one I've tried in 2025\nAs TechRadar's resident fitness guinea pig, I'm on the hook every time a new fitness gadget needs to be tested in-house. Consequently, I've tried loads of new fitness gadgets, from the best heart rate monitors to smart rings, and if I'm not at my laptop in TR Towers, I can usually be found in the gym or on a run.\nHowever, by far the most common categories are fitness trackers and smartwatches, wrist-based devices used to track exercise, sleep and recovery. So far, I've tried 10 of these in 2025.\nI've reviewed many of the best smartwatches and best fitness trackers released this year, but those I haven't, I've still worn for at least a few days to gauge the effectiveness of their fitness and health tracking features.\nIn no particular order, the trackers I've tested (which have been released this year so far) are:\n- Garmin Instinct 3\n- Garmin Venu X1\n- Suunto Run\n- Samsung Galaxy Fit 3\n- Samsung Galaxy Watch8\n- Samsung Galaxy Watch8 Classic\n- Whoop MG\n- Honor Watch 5 Ultra\n- OnePlus Watch 3\n- Amazfit Active 2\nThis encompasses a variety of price points, formats, and features. There are cheap fitness trackers like the Fit 3 and Active 2, expensive ones like the Venu X1 and Watch8 Classic, and a screenless recovery band in the Whoop MG.\nThe one I'm still wearing? The Samsung Galaxy Watch8 and Whoop MG both made very strong cases to occupy that coveted regular spot on my wrist.\nThe Watch8 has excellent smartwatch features, great running metrics, and like the Venu X1, is lovely and slim. However, I'm often not using a Samsung phone, so I don't get the best of the Watch8, and the Venu X1 has a few extra tools like its built-in torch and the Primary Race widget that give it the edge.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe Whoop MG's comprehensive recovery metrics and detailed health analysis are rich, and offer great scope for workouts, particularly the gym with its excellent workout builder. However, its lack of GPS and screen means that for detailed running and route analysis, it's not the all-in-one solution I look for.\nThe Garmin Venu X1 has the best of all of the above. The running insights and route creation mechanics are great, its recovery tools such as the Training Readiness score are useful, and it's chock-full of fun little tools like the built-in LED torch and full-color maps.\nIt's slim and the fabric strap, combined with the cambered stainless steel back, curves and sits comfortably on my wrist. Without the always-on display enabled, you get a full week of battery life between charges, more than either the Watch8 or Whoop MG.\nOverall, I find myself wearing it more than any of the 10 new trackers I've tried so far this year. That's not to say the others aren't worth buying: quite the opposite. But as a runner looking for a slim fitness tracker with detailed route management and recovery metrics, the 4.5-star Venu X1 hits the spot for me.\nYou might also like...\n- Do you struggle on hikes?

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nAfter a week with the Apple Watch Series 10 it\u2019s clear that the looks might be familiar, but a larger screen with much better viewing angles and a slimmer overall build make for a comfortable watch that feels more expansive than ever before.\nPros\n- +\nNew display is gorgeous\n- +\nThe 46-millimeter is way more expansive but doesn't feel massive\n- +\nThinner build overall makes for a much more comfortable watch\nCons\n- -\nStill fast, but the S10 chip doesn't deliver a performance boost over the S9\n- -\nNo increase in battery life, though fast-charging could solve this\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nApple Watch Series 10: One-Minute Review\nAs in years past, you could mistake the Apple Watch Series 10 for the Series 9 or 8, but upon closer inspection it\u2019s a fairly large upgrade in terms of hardware, and enables a better on-the-wrist experience.\nThe highlight of the Series 10, in a mostly unchanged build that keeps a rounded-square silhouette, is a larger display that offers impressive viewing angles, allowing you to glance down at your wrist in almost any position to view the time or see an incoming notification. It\u2019s still super-bright, which is great if you\u2019re using it outdoors on a sunny day, and fans of classic watches will appreciate that the refresh rate goes down to 1Hz for more precise second-hand moves. You still get your pick of two sizes, but they\u2019re larger for 2024 at 42mm and 46mm, up from 41mm and 45mm.\nEven if you opt for the larger Series 10, it won\u2019t feel too big on the wrist \u2013 at least based on my testing \u2013 as it has minimal bezels and protrudes from your wrist less at just 9.7mm thick, which feels super-thin. It\u2019s also light enough for you to forget about at 30g for the 42mm or 36.4g for the 46mm.\nIt again delivers a zippy watchOS 11 experience thanks to the S10 chip inside, which is basically a redesigned S9 chip, and you get the reassuring sense the Series 10 has been future-proofed for some time. It still supports Double Tap for easier control when you only have one hand free, and the new voice isolation on calls makes it easier to chat on the phone via your wrist.\nWhile there isn\u2019t a bigger battery inside, Apple has sped up the charging here, and we averaged about 20 hours of use, even with a tracked workout and with sleep-tracking enabled. It feels like a more modern take on the classic Apple Watch experience: the upgrades are still iterative year over year, but if you have an older model, upgrading to the Series 10 could make a serious impact. It also supports the latest health feature from Apple, sleep apnea detection, which also comes to the Series 9 and Ultra 2 with watchOS 11.\nThere\u2019s no price increase for either size of the Apple Watch Series 10 over last year\u2019s models, which is great news.\nApple Watch Series 10: Specs\n| Row 0 - Cell 0 | Row 0 - Cell 1 |\n| Component | Apple Watch Series 10 |\n| Price | From $399 / \u00a3399 / AU$649 |\n| Dimensions | 42mm x 36mm x 9.7mm (42mm), 46mm x 39mm x 9.7mm (46mm) |\n| Weight | 30g for the 42mm or 36.4g for the 46mm |\n| Case/Bezel | Aluminum with a metal back or Titanium |\n| Display | 42mm Always-On Retina LTPO3 display Wide-angle OLED at 374 by 446 or 46mm lways-On Retina LTPO3 display Wide-angle OLED at 416 by 496 |\n| GPS | L1 GPS, GNSS, Galileo, and BeiDou |\n| Battery Life | Rated at 18-hours of battery life or 36 hours in \"Low Power Mode\" |\n| Connection | Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi, Second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, and LTE (Optional) |\n| Water Resistance | WR50 and IP7X |\nApple Watch Series 10: Price and Availability\nEven with two larger sizes, the Apple Watch Series 10 keeps the same starting prices for the aluminum styles as the corresponding Series 9 watches. The 42mm aluminum watch with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity starts at $399 / \u00a3399 / AU$649, but you\u2019ll pay a bit more for LTE connectivity. The larger 46mm aluminum watch with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth starts at $429 / \u00a3429 / AU$699 \u2013 again, LTE connectivity is additional.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nFor the Series 10 aluminum colors, you can pick between Rose Gold, Silver, or Jet Black. The latter is my favorite and looks quite stunning in real life. If you\u2019re willing to pay a good chunk more, you can opt for Polished Titanium in Natural, Gold, or Slate. Those higher-end models come in either a Wi-Fi only or cellular with LTE editions as well.\nIf you\u2019re already sold, the Apple Watch Series 10 is up for order now and officially launches on September 20, 2024, and that\u2019s also the earliest day that orders will ship.\nApple Watch Series 10: Design\n- The new display steals the show, especially on the 46mm size\n- Overall, a thinner build means the Series 10 protrudes less\n- Your existing bands will still work and are easy to attach\nIt\u2019s a good thing that we\u2019re starting with the design of the Apple Watch Series 10, because while it may look familiar and even similar to that of the Series 9, it\u2019s where much of the change lies.\nThe tenth Apple Watch, which was unveiled on the tenth anniversary of Apple debuting its first-generation Watch, sticks with a rounded square design. It still comes in two sizes, but the screen is stretched further to the edges, giving the appearance of it sloping down the sides. It provides a night and day improvement over previous models for off-axis viewing. To a degree, it\u2019s completing what the Apple Watch Series 7, a model that stretched the screen in a smaller fashion, started.\nAs mentioned, the Apple Watch Series 10 again comes in two sizes, but both are larger \u2013 the previous 41mm is now 42mm, and the 45mm is now 46mm. Now, on paper, a difference of 1mm might not seem that large, but if you\u2019ve worn the Apple Watch 7, 8, or 9, and then put on a Series 10, it becomes apparent. With a smartwatch, each millimeter matters as it\u2019s additional tangible room to display items and interact with the screen. The 46mm Series 10 actually provides 3% more screen real estate than the Apple Watch Ultra 2, and 7% more than the previous 45mm Apple Watch.\nThe display tech has changed a bit as well \u2013 it\u2019s now a wide-angle OLED, which helps with viewing angles by upping the brightness and still delivers a punchy, crisp experience in daily use for viewing the time, apps, photos, or even when responding to a text. It\u2019s now LTPO-3, which is the tech that first enabled the always-on functionality, and here it allows the refresh rate to drop all the way to 1Hz, and for Watch Faces like the new Reflections or Flux to show the second-hand moving.\nLike other Apple Watches, you can control your Apple Watch 10 via touch, the Digital Crown, or the rectangular button on the right side. You can also use your voice via hands-free Siri to send a message, make a call, ask about health data, or open apps. All of this is unchanged from recent models, and it\u2019s still very easy to navigate around watchOS 11 and use the various aspects of the Apple Watch Series 10.\nI\u2019ve been wearing the 46mm Apple Watch Series 10 in Jet Black, a glossy aluminum finish that looks stunning and oh-so-sleek. That color name might sound familiar \u2013 it dates back to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which came in the same shade. The Series 10 comes in a few other aluminum shades, and also in polished titanium for the first time.\nAlongside the larger screen, the Apple Watch Series 10 is also 1mm thinner than the Series 9 or Series 8 that came before it. It looks more flat, like an elegant pancake or crepe (take your pick), and it\u2019s also lighter on your wrist and protrudes less. That\u2019s likely a good thing since the front here is all glass with no raised bezel, which you\u2019d find on the Ultra 2. It\u2019s still covered in a layer of Sapphire Glass on Titanium models or Ion-X on aluminum models to up the durability. Like the Series 9, Series 10 meets the WR50 rating for water resistance and the IP6X rating for dust.\nThe back is now made of metal, which gives the watch a more single-form, unified look. It\u2019s harder to spot a seam around the sides, but the rear again features the sensor stack, which remains untouched and offers a similar array of health features \u2013 with one major exception for models sold in the US, which I\u2019ll touch on below.\nMuch of the Apple Watch Series 10 is familiar, then, and it\u2019s clear that the technology giant won\u2019t be ditching this design for its smartwatch anytime soon; Apple is now polishing it, aiming to let users get more out of it. The bigger screen combined with a thinner design makes this smartwatch more comfortable on the wrist \u2013 even at 46mm \u2013 and lets you do more with it.\n- Design score: 4 / 5\nApple Watch Series 10: Features\n- It\u2019s running watchOS 11 out of the box, which finally lets you customize Activity goals\n- Sleep apnea detection is supported here, and also works on the Series 9 and Ultra 2\n- Voice isolation for calls is a useful arrival\nOut of the box, the Apple Watch Series 10 comes running watchOS 11, which is a pretty packed update. What I\u2019ve been enjoying the most is the updated Smart Stack, which you can access by swiping up on any watch face or by rotating the Digital Crown.\nPreviously, this was just a stack of handy widgets, be it Now playing if you\u2019re listening to a song, the weather forecast, or even your Activity Rings. watchOS 11 adds support for Live Activities from your iPhone to appear here, so when you\u2019re waiting for a taxi from Uber or Lyft, you can see how far away the driver is on your Apple Watch, or even monitor how long until you reach your destination with a quick glance down at your wrist.\nThis is infinitely handy and works for a number of applications \u2013 essentially, any that offer a Live Activity on the iPhone will be supported here. It\u2019s super-helpful, and I especially like that you can see a bit of what else is in the stack on the 46mm Apple Watch Series 10. Similarly, when you\u2019re reading an email, iMessage, a text message over RCS, or a news story, you can see more lines of text and, therefore, more information. It\u2019s similar to what Google has done with the larger Pixel Watch 3, and it\u2019s seemingly a trend, so the ball is now in Samsung\u2019s court with the Galaxy Watch.\nOn the activity and health front, watchOS 11 finally lets you adjust your daily goals, so if you need a rest day you can pause and not risk messing up a streak. There\u2019s also a new Training Load feature, which aims to show you the longer impact of a workout on your body. Of course, you can still track steps, calories burned, and exercise minutes.\nDue to an ongoing legal dispute in the United States, Blood Oxygen or Sp02 monitoring is not functioning on the Apple Watch Series 10. The application is still here, but when you open it, it displays this message: \u201cThe Blood Oxygen app is no longer available. Learn more in the health app on your iPhone.\u201d If you\u2019re outside the US, including in Australia or the United Kingdom, it will function normally. Additionally, heart-rate tracking, the ability to take an electrocardiogram, and skin-temperature sensing still function.\nA new health feature, Sleep Apnea detection, is available on the Apple Watch Series 10, but you don\u2019t need to upgrade in order to get it, as it also works on the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2. The US Food and Drug Administration has now authorized this feature, and it\u2019s shipping with watchOS 11. It works to detect sleep apnea using a new metric called Breathing Disturbances, which are detected by accelerometer readings passed through a custom algorithm. If it detects an occurrence, you\u2019ll be presented with a notification on your wrist and more details within the Health app on iOS or iPadOS, allowing you to share the data with a doctor quickly. Of course, it\u2019s not a diagnosis, but rather a suggestion that you should see a doctor or specialist.\nThe left-hand side of the Apple Watch Series 10 is home to a visibly larger speaker that produces the same amount of sound as the Series 9. This redesign was necessary because Apple shaved a millimeter off the total thickness, but it also unlocks the ability to playback music, audiobooks, and podcasts from your Apple Watch directly. You can hear it, but you\u2019re better off listening with a pair of AirPods or on your iPhone. Considering it can produce the same level of volume, it\u2019s also a little strange that this isn\u2019t arriving on previous models.\nIf you\u2019re a fan of taking calls via your smartwatch, Inspector Gadget-style, there\u2019s a new neural network that works with the single onboard microphone to identify your voice and block out background noise \u2013 both constant and unexpected sounds \u2013 so that whomever you\u2019re on the phone with can hear you clearly. This works exceptionally well, on a par with the voice isolation built into iPhones \u2013 I used it while walking around a busy lobby, and the friend to whom I was talking thought I was alone. While watching Bruce Springsteen at a festival in Asbury Park in New Jersey, I was able to call my dad from my wrist when my hands were full, and he could clearly hear me, albeit with some background sound.\nDouble Tap, which lets you answer a call, start voice dictation for a message, or control music playback with a pinch of your thumb and index finger, is as fun and helpful to use on the Series 10 as it was on the Series 9 or Ultra 2. These enhancements let you use the Apple Watch even when conditions might not be the most conducive, like when your hands are full.\n- Features score: 4 / 5\nApple Watch Series 10: Performance\n- No performance boost year-over-year, but still a zippy experience\n- Fast-charging is faster with the same charging puck\n- New watch faces take advantage of the new wide-angle display\nThe Apple-made S10 processor powers the larger display, watchOS 11, and everything else the Series 10 is capable of. It makes everything happen pretty instantly, although if you have an Apple Watch Series 9 or Ultra 2 you shouldn\u2019t expect a performance boost. It delivers the same speeds as the S9, and is merely redesigned from a two-story build to a flat, one-story solution to fit inside the Series 10.\nEven so, for the price, the Series 10 performs in line with other smartwatches. Applications open very quickly, both first-party and third-party ones, and you can easily load content, dictate a message, or even use the Translate app in a jiffy. Newer features within watchOS 11, like Smart Stack, enhancements to workouts, and new Watch Faces, all run well.\nThe new Flux watch face is especially fun. It displays the time in a top-to-bottom format with numerals, can be customized in fun colors, and rather than a second hand going around it has a ticker line that goes up, thanks to the 1Hz refresh rate \u2013 check out the GIF above to see it in action. This, as well as the Photos face and the new Reflections face (which, fun fact, can be customized to be very colorful, not just in shades to match the titanium Series 10) look sharp and are responsive.\nWith indoor cycle, outdoor walk, strength, and yoga workouts tracked on the Series 10, I found the results and data collected to align pretty closely with those from other smartwatches, including the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2, Pixel Watch 3, and Galaxy Watch 7. On the larger 46mm Series 10, I appreciated that I could make better use of the Workouts app and swipe through to engage with different elements. I found that heart-rate tracking was in line with those other watches as well.\nLast but certainly not least, let\u2019s talk about battery life \u2013 and no, Apple is not promising a longer runtime here. The 42mm and 46mm Apple Watch Series 10 are promised to last \u201call-day\u201d at 18 hours in standard mode or 36 hours with low-power mode for both. Of course, mileage does vary based on how you\u2019re using your watch. I was meeting those marks and occasionally getting a little longer \u2013 on a day with one 30-minute workout, I got close to 22 hours of battery life. Before bed, I charged it to 100% and took it off the charger at 11:55pm; it hit 0% the next day at 9:45pm, with always-on enabled and one workout tracked. On more intense days with phone calls, following a map route, or even more workouts, the battery did, unsurprisingly, drain a bit faster.\nIf you intend to use sleep tracking, you\u2019ll need to charge your watch at some point during the day or top it up before bed. Apple has improved the charging speeds here, and thankfully, it\u2019s not down to a new charging cable that you need to buy; it\u2019s actually thanks to the coil inside the Series 10. You can now get from 0% to 80% in about 30 minutes from at least a 20-watt charger, and Apple does include the fast-charging braided charging puck cable in the box. In my testing over a week, I found that I could get enough percentage for sleep tracking, or quickly top the watch off, with about a 10 to 15-minute charge.\nThe Watch 10 likely won\u2019t last for true multi-day use like the Apple Watch Ultra 2 or a Garmin smartwatch, but I did get around 20 hours of use before having to recharge, even with more demanding use.\n- Performance score: 4 / 5\nApple Watch Series 10: Should I Buy?\n| Row 0 - Cell 0 | Row 0 - Cell 1 |\n| Value | 4/5 |\n| Design | 4/5 |\n| Features | 4/5 |\n| Performance | 4/5 |\nBuy it if\u2026\nYou have an older Apple Watch\nIf you\u2019re still using an Apple Watch Series 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8, you\u2019ll likely get a few new features (minus Blood Oxygen tracking in the US), a bigger display, and better power efficiency thanks to the S10 chip inside of the Series 10.\nYou want a sleek, sophisticated smartwatch\nThe Jet Black Series 10 is a real stunner and looks very elegant, as do the much-more costly polished titanium models. It pairs good looks with excellent performance and a big display.\nDon\u2019t buy it if\u2026\nYou want something more rugged\nWith an all-glass front that doesn\u2019t feature a raised lip, I wouldn\u2019t want to take the Series 10 rock climbing or on my next adventure \u2013 if you\u2019re the outdoors type, you\u2019ll likely be better served by the much more rugged Apple Watch Ultra 2.\nYou don\u2019t need all the bells and whistles\nIf you can live without an always-on display or the ability to take an electrocardiogram, consider the second-gen Apple Watch SE, which is also now eligible for the watchOS 11 update.\nYou have an Apple Watch Series 9\nUnless you\u2019re craving the larger display or thinner build, the rest of the Series 10 experience is very similar to that of the Series 9. And if your model was purchased earlier in the launch cycle, it might still support blood oxygen tracking in the US.\nApple Watch Series 10: How I tested\nI\u2019ve been reviewing smartwatches for several years, including the Apple Watch for several generations, and I\u2019ve owned one since the first generation. To write and test for this review I wore the Apple Watch Series 10 for a week, putting it through its paces and testing new features of the latest model and watchOS 11, as well as classic elements.\nI tracked various workouts using the Series 10, including yoga, indoor cycling, and outdoor walks. I compared the tracking data with data from an Apple Watch Ultra 2, Apple Watch Series 9, Galaxy Watch 7, and Pixel Watch 3. I also played around with the new customizations for Activity Rings within watchOS 11.\nSpecific to the Apple Watch Series 10, I tried out viewing the new wide-angle display in various viewing conditions, including outdoors on a bright and sunny day and indoors under fluorescent lights. I tested the battery life over the course of several days, including marking down the percentage on an hourly basis.\nI also used a variety of applications, took many calls, and tried out several watch faces.\nFirst reviewed September 2024.\nJacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

      "text": "Garmin watches could finally get a key feature Apple's had for years \u2013 here's why it matters\n- Two new leaks claim future Garmin watches will be getting LTE connectivity\n- This feature allows you to add smartwatches to a data plan, allowing you to make calls and stream without a phone\n- It's a feature included on Apple and Samsung watches, usually on more expensive models\nTwo new leaks claim we could soon be able to make calls, stream music and answer texts from some of the best Garmin watches yet to be announced \u2013 even without an attached phone.\nYes, LTE connectivity is coming to Garmin watches, according to separate reports from leak sites Garmin Rumors and The5Krunner. Garmin Rumors partnered with a site called AppSensa, which digs into code to discover in-development features. Garmin is reportedly going \"all-in\" into cellular connectivity, according to the site.\nListed features include emergency satellite SOS messaging, two-way messaging, LiveTrack location sharing without a phone, and voice calling with contacts.\nGarmin Messenger, the watch-to-watch satellite messaging service, is also reportedly being expanded. Perhaps Garmin Messenger will now be Garmin's principle messaging client, able to text using your data plan and reaching phones as well as other Garmin watches?\nThe5KRunner also reports these claims, stating that the obvious starting point is a rumored Fenix 8 Pro, in which the \"Pro\" stands for the inclusion of LTE connectivity. The best Apple Watches and best Samsung watches often come in cheaper Bluetooth-only and more expensive LTE-capable variations, so it would make sense for Garmin to follow this pattern.\nA big step forward\nGarmins have long been considered separate entities to smartwatches, as they're more like adventure companions or training tools than everyday communications devices. However, certain ranges such as the Garmin Venu series already blur the lines a little.\nMaking the watches capable of no-phone communications would mean a huge change in strategy, and would enable more smartwatch-like models, such as the Garmin Venu X1 to seriously compete with the likes and the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIf true, I'm intrigued to see which future models get this rumored LTE option. The Garmin Venu 4 seems like a no-brainer. One commenter on our Garmin Venu 4 rumors hub agreed, stating: \"If the Garmin Venu 4 ever came with LTE and text message response that would definitely be a gamechanger. So many current iPhone users would jump on the Venu 4 \u2013 it would be a dream watch.\"\nPerhaps we'll see Forerunner Pros with LTE options in future too, as phoneless LiveTrack seems like a great safety tool for triathletes and trail runners doing solo training.\nYou might also like...\nMatt is TechRadar's expert on all things fitness, wellness and wearable tech.\nA former staffer at Men's Health, he holds a Master's Degree in journalism from Cardiff and has written for brands like Runner's World, Women's Health, Men's Fitness, LiveScience and Fit&Well on everything fitness tech, exercise, nutrition and mental wellbeing.\nMatt's a keen runner, ex-kickboxer, not averse to the odd yoga flow, and insists everyone should stretch every morning.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nAfter a week with the Apple Watch Series 9, and a demonstration of some of the features unavailable at launch, it's clear that it's largely more of the same again \u2013 but with a twist. Thanks to the upgraded S9 chip, for once when discussing an Apple flagship model, it seems like there\u2019s at least one genuinely useful, game-changing new feature here that will be used every day in the form of Double Tap. The shift towards more environmentally friendly materials is a welcome one, and the option of a brighter screen is always nice, but I\u2019m again frustrated by the lack of any improvement in battery life.\nPros\n- +\nBrighter, more powerful screen\n- +\nUseful new double-tap gestures\n- +\nNew S9 chipset\nCons\n- -\nSame 18-hour battery life\n- -\nIdentical design and sizes\n- -\nwatchOS 10 covers most bases on older watches\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nEditor's Note\n\u2022 Original review date: September 2023\n\u2022 New Series 10 with upgrades out now\n\u2022 Launch price: $399 / \u00a3399 / AU$649\n\u2022 Official price now: $399 / \u00a3399 / AU$649\nUpdate: November 2024. In 2024, the Apple Watch Series 9 is no longer the best Apple Watch on the market, an honor that falls to the newer Apple Watch Series 10. However, the differences between the two are scant, certainly not enough to merit upgrading from one to the other. The Series 10 is slightly bigger at 42mm and 46mm respectively, versus 41mm and 45mm for the Series 9. The Always-on display is 40% brighter when viewed at an angle on the Series 10, and there\u2019s a slightly faster chip. The Series 10 ditches stainless steel for titanium, but otherwise there\u2019s not much in it.\nAs such, if you can find an Apple Watch Series 9 with a decent discount, it\u2019s well worth considering. We've seen prices drop to as low as $279.99/\u00a3299.99/AU$499 in big sale events. So if you spot one at those prices (or lower), it might well be worth snagging over a more expensive Series 10, or pushing the boat out if you're considering the cheaper Apple Watch SE. The rest of this review remains as previously published.\nApple Watch Series 9: One-minute review\nAfter several fairly iterative updates, the Apple Watch Series 9 finally brings a genuinely exciting, use-everyday new feature to the flagship Apple Watch in the form of Double Tap. The gesture is sure to make waves when it\u2019s made available later this year, and I found it a delight to use in my brief time with it.\nA brighter screen and on-device Siri, ensuring that health queries are processed securely, are welcome changes, too. Although not much else has changed, as usual, the Watch 9 is going to be the best Apple Watch for most people. The exceptions occur if you're looking for a real budget bargain, in which case look to the Apple Watch SE 2, or a proper premium model in the Ultra 2.\nThe watch\u2019s eco-friendly aspirations are admirable, and the move to Ultra Wideband radio technology is something that will pay dividends as subsequent iPhones make use of the tech. The improved Find Devices feature, for example, offers increased accuracy as a result of the stronger connection Ultra Wideband offers, even telling you how many feet away your phone is from your watch. At present this tech is only available with Series 9 and iPhone 15 at present, although it's sure to be on all subsequent phones and watches.\nConsider the Watch 9 fairly future-proof, at least for the next few years. It offers a preview of Apple\u2019s ambitions, with a carbon-neutral approach to manufacturing (well, driven by marketing) and a growing list of devices linked by Ultra Wideband. The Series 9 will be able to make use of new features developed for Ultra Wideband-capable devices, presumably available on watchOS 11 and beyond.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nHowever, innovation can only go so far: the new Apple Watch shares the exact same 18-hour battery life, sizes, operating system, and design as its predecessors, and so \u2013 as we tend to say every year \u2013 the update is iterative in many ways. As ever, it\u2019s the iOS watch to get if you're looking for a new wearable, but if you already have the Apple Watch Series 8 or Series 7 you can probably be excused.\nApple Watch Series 9: Specifications\n| Component | Apple Watch Series 9 (41mm) | Apple Watch Series 9 (45mm) |\n| Price | From $399 / \u00a3399 / AU$649 | From $429 / \u00a3429 / AU$699 |\n| Dimensions | 41 x 35 x 10.7mm | 45 x 38 x 10.7mm |\n| Weight | 32.1g (aluminum) | 38.7g (aluminum) |\n| Case/bezel | Aluminum or stainless steel | Aluminum or stainless steel |\n| Display | 352 x 430 px always-on OLED Retina Display | 396 x 484 px always-on OLED Retina Display |\n| GPS | Yes (unspecified) | Yes (unspecified) |\n| Battery life | 18 hours | 18 hours |\n| Connection | Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi, LTE options available | Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi, LTE options available |\n| Water resistant | Yes, WR50 (swimproof) | Yes, WR50 (swimproof) |\nApple Watch Series 9: Price and availability\n- Starts from $399 / \u00a3399 / AU$649 with aluminum case\n- Two sizes: 41mm and 45mm, with LTE options\n- Tougher stainless steel case also available\nThe Apple Watch Series 9 was announced at Apple's September 12 event and is available now, with prices starting from $399 / \u00a3399 / AU$649. That\u2019s the price for the cheapest 41mm model with an aluminum case (with color options of Midnight (black), Starlight (a sort of silver/gold hybrid), Silver, Product Red or the new Pink offering) and GPS connectivity only, without cellular LTE connectivity, and it's the same price as the Series 8 was in the US, and slightly cheaper than the 8 in the UK. Score!\nIf you get this version you won't be able to connect to the internet without Wi-Fi or your phone handy, although you can still use GPS functions while you work out. For those who want a larger model, LTE connectivity, or a stainless steel case (which comes in a choice of attractive gold, silver and graphite finishes), you\u2019ll pay an additional premium as usual.\nFor example, a 45mm aluminum watch in Pink, with GPS only, costs $429 / \u00a3429 / AU$699, while the GPS and Cellular LTE option costs $529 / \u00a3529 / AU$859. If you were to go with the stainless steel option, the price would increase again. This is nothing new in Apple Watch world, but it's worth noting if you\u2019re thinking of picking one up for the first time.\nIf you want an even more premium option, there's also the Apple Watch Ultra 2. This brings a raft of outdoor-focused features, a more rugged design and a better screen - but for a higher price still. You can read more about that in our hands-on Apple Watch Ultra 2 review.\nValue score: 4/5\nApple Watch Series 9: Design\n- Lots of recycled materials\n- Identical architecture to predecessors\n- New bands and pink aluminum case option\nAs you might expect from a flagship Apple Watch at this point, Apple isn\u2019t reinventing the wheel. It got things right early on, and come hell or high water it's stuck to its guns (with the possible exception of the \u2018radical\u2019 Apple Watch Ultra design). Same two sizes, same rotating digital crown, same side button, the mic and speaker introduced several generations back are still present and correct\u2026 to look at its chassis, it\u2019s virtually the same watch. Series 8 users hoping for a change are better off looking elsewhere.\nFortunately, the new watch is still incredibly simple to set up and use straight away. Using a combination of the digital crown, side button and touchscreen, our early navigation of the new watchOS 10 operating system was smooth and intuitive. Bringing up Settings with the side button feels like a logical move, and I love the new widget stack, which makes it far easier to jump to the one you want.\nMore than any other feature, the widgets have transformed the Apple Watch experience for me, but this isn\u2019t unique to the Series 9 \u2013 any Apple Watch from the Series 5 or above will receive the watchOS 10 update.\nWhat has changed is the composition of materials used in the Series 9. Apple is keen to emphasize the fact that each new Apple Watch produced is now \u2018carbon-neutral\u2019, in part thanks to a combination of recycled materials used both inside and outside the watch, such as the cobalt in its batteries and aluminum used in its casings.\nApple is also attempting to offset electricity used during charging and reduce shipping emissions \u2013 even the packaging is 25% smaller, so that more units can fit into shipping crates.\nWe\u2019ve covered Apple\u2019s big carbon-neutrality claims extensively elsewhere, so we won\u2019t go into much more detail in this review, but this eco-friendly ethos has also led to some cool redesigned bands. The standard sport loop is now made from 82% recycled yarn, while select versions of the swim-proof silicone-fluoroelastomer band are textured as a result of the recycling process, making each band unique. That\u2019s pretty neat.\nA new Pink color, as mentioned, is sure to be snapped up by everyone who saw Barbie this summer, but the Midnight, Silver, Starlight, and Product Red colors all make a welcome return from last year. The premium stainless steel options can also be bought with a metal band matching the watch\u2019s casing.\nDesign score: 4/5\nApple Watch Series 9: Features\n- Double Tap is an obvious standout\n- New Ultra Wideband use cases are great\n- On-watch Siri secures health data\nLet\u2019s get into the details. I tried the Double Tap feature, which garnered much of the attention during the announcement event, although it won't actually land on the Apple Watch 9 until October. Double Tap uses the accelerometer and gyroscope to detect intention: you have to raise your watch as if looking at the time before performing the two-pinch gesture with your watch hand, as this prevents it from being triggered accidentally. It can be used to perform any main action on any complication you happen to have open on your watch face, from starting and stopping a timer to snoozing an alarm, to answering a call\nI really liked using it, and I firmly believe this is just the start. My nightmares of having to pinch the air over and over again like a crab while trying to get the thing to work were completely unfounded: I was able to stop a timer, answer a call and access other complications very easily, first time.\nOther notable new features include the use-cases for the new second-generation Ultra Wideband radio technology. The Find Devices app has changed: as long as you\u2019re connecting to another device with a second-gen Ultra Wideband chip in it (so just an iPhone 15 model for now then), you\u2019ll be able to see exactly how many feet away that device is on your Watch, along with a directional icon. You can then play Marco Polo until you get within a foot of it, at which point the Series 9 will issue a green tick to indicate that you\u2019ve found it.\nI was very impressed by the demo, but at the moment it\u2019s limited to just the Series 9, Apple Watch Ultra 2, and iPhone 15 models. As future devices come along with this technology installed, it\u2019s going to become far more widely used (and rightly so, the feature\u2019s great), even if relatively few of us are going to be lucky enough to snap up two new Apple gadgets this year.\nOn-device Siri is available for the first time, which means it doesn\u2019t have to connect to the cloud in order to process your questions. This is a fairly niche change for most, but a big leap forward for those concerned about privacy is that you can now use Siri to access your health data.\nApple is very keen to emphasize that any data about your health either remains on your device or is encrypted before being shared. Having Siri available to read you your Move ring status or menstrual-cycle tracking data might sound like a minor thing, but it's a long-term win: we\u2019re slowly realizing that, collectively, we\u2019re far too cavalier with our health information these days.\nFeatures score: 4/5\nApple Watch Series 9: Performance\n- Excellent day-to-day usage\n- New brightest setting is redundant\n- Lack of improvement on battery is a frustration\nSince my initial first impressions, I\u2019ve been wearing the watch for six days, paired with an iPhone 13 running iOS 17. I won\u2019t delve too much into what it\u2019s like to live with watchOS 10 for a week, as that\u2019s not strictly speaking unique to Apple Watch Series 9. However, watchOS 10 does dramatically improve the experience via the Smart Stack. With a swipe or a scroll up, I can see my upcoming events (including all the events cluttering up my work shared calendar, which I must sort out) the beautifully animated widget version of the weather app, movement rings, a trending news headline, and anything else I\u2019m actively running, such as workouts or Spotify.\nI\u2019ve always loved widget stacks and lists. The widget list comes as standard on the best Garmin watches, but the experience here is very unlike Garmin\u2019s pared-back health-focused approach. Small animations, in beautiful full-color and with that refresh rate we mentioned in the Design section, make scrolling through the stack with the digital crown a breeze, serving me up snapshots of all the information I\u2019d want on my watch at any given time. As usual with Apple, the interface is beautifully designed, and I\u2019ve found that the only times I need to press into the digital crown and open my watch are if I\u2019m after a specific app, such as the ECG functionality.\nAt the time of writing, the Double Tap function is still not available, so beyond my initial test with Apple I was unable to use it regularly and judge its performance in an everyday situation. However, I was able to test all the usual features, and found them, as expected, up to snuff. I used my Apple Watch to accept a call and chat when I didn\u2019t have a free hand, find my phone when I lost it (unfortunately, the improved Find Devices functionality compatible with iPhone 15 also wasn\u2019t available for regular use during testing) and set timers for myself while I was cooking with Siri. On-device Siri is now noticeably snappier and responsive, and these everyday tasks are more intuitive to perform than they are on any other smartwatch to date.\nAsking Siri about your Health status without having to worry about sharing your data is neat, but niche, and I find more use for Siri as a fancy kitchen timer than I do as a font of knowledge. I can\u2019t wait until I can cancel those timers with a simple double-pinch.\nI did use my Apple Watch to record a run and a hilly hike on separate days. It wasn\u2019t a strenuous hike, as you can see in the picture below - we stopped for a cup of tea from a thermos halfway round - but the Apple Watch Series 9 offers identical tracking capability to previous models, with split paces, a heart rate graph, and GPS tracking. More granular information, such as time spent in different heart rate zones and (for runners) ground contact time and vertical oscillation, is available by expanding these windows. Loading the third-party AllTrails app onto the watch during my hike allowed me to see my progress without reaching for my phone every time I was in danger of taking a wrong turn on the trail.\nSo far, the Apple Watch Series 9 performs pretty much the same as its predecessors, but was the battery compromised by that up-to-2,000-nit OLED screen? Happily, no: I still got about 20 hours of use out of my Apple Watch on average, though I should caveat that by saying that the screen has three standard brightness settings and I found the middle setting more than sufficient for my needs; on the brightest setting, battery life may suffer.\nThen again, you may not ever need the brightest setting. Even on my hike, when the September sun was clear and unobscured on the side of the hilly outcrop we were trekking around, the Retina Display screen was bright enough that I never needed to dive into my settings and start changing things. The only time I actually went into the settings to turn it up was to deliberately test the brighter screen function: most of the time, the watch is so good that the brighter screen option actually seems unnecessary.\nMy biggest gripe is that the Watch 9 still needs charging daily. I\u2019m used to watches that last days or even weeks and would have loved last year\u2019s Ultra battery improvement (36 hours) on this year\u2019s mainline Apple Watch. Unfortunately, Apple seems intent on providing only minor upgrades with each refresh, and though it exceeds its promise of 18 hours, it\u2019s never quite enough. Thank goodness it\u2019s quick to charge.\nWhen chatting to our phones editor Alex Walker-Todd, he likened Apple\u2019s iterative upgrades to improving a fire extinguisher - it doesn\u2019t have to be reinvented, it just has to be great at doing its job when you need it. And the Apple Watch Series 9, despite its comparative lack of innovations outside of the new Double Tap feature, and even allowing for its frustratingly short battery life, is great at doing its job.\nPerformance score: 4/5\nApple Watch Series 9: Scorecard\n| Category | Comment | Score |\n| Value | The flagship Apple Watch retains the price structure of previous years, and is actually less in the UK. | 4/5 |\n| Design | An improved eco-ethos and excellent software architecture when paired with watchOS 10. | 4/5 |\n| Features | Double Tap is going to change the game, but the Watch\u2019s improved S9 chip has other tricks, too. | 4/5 |\n| Performance | It performs well enough, just like any other Apple Watch, and shines in many everyday scenarios.

      "text": "Apple Watch Blood Oxygen feature isn't returning anytime soon as company fails in creative court bid to get ban lifted\nA more favorable ruling could have helped lift the blood oxygen ban in the US\nApple has been awarded the paltry sum of $250 in damages after a court in the US ruled that wearable tech rival Masimo infringed on two of its smartwatch design patents. However, Apple has failed in its grander bid to try and score a means to overturn the ban on its blood oxygen feature in the US.\nAs reported by Reuters, Apple took Masimo to court over its W1 and Freedom smartwatches, models which Apple claims willfully violate its patented smartwatch designs. It's part of a much bigger intellectual property spat between the companies that ultimately led to a ban on the blood oxygen feature, which can no longer be shipped on the best Apple Watches in the US as a result.\nNew models sold in the US, including the Apple Watch Series 10 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, come without the blood oxygen feature as a result of an International Trade Commission ruling, which found that Apple's own blood oxygen tech infringed on patents held by Masimo.\nWhile Apple's most recent ruling is a tick in the win column, the lawsuit really had nothing to do with the niche smartwatches Masimo sells, and everything to do with Apple trying to get that ban overturned. To that end, the case hasn't been a success for Apple, and is bad news for customers who continue to miss out on the important health feature.\nBlood oxygen on Apple Watch \u2013 still in Limbo\nAs noted by ip fray's Florian Mueller, a world-leading patent litigation expert, Apple's most recent case against Masimo was \"never was about Masimo competing with Apple in the smartwatch market.\" The company sells a negligible number of smartwatches, and only sells them domestically to comply with ITC regulations.\nAs Mueller explains, \"What Apple really wanted was either to obtain an injunction so that it would have an argument for lifting Masimo\u2019s import ban or at least a legal fight over whether Apple should get an injunction.\"\nApple was hoping its recent design case would have given it ammunition to take back to a court to help it obtain an injunction to overturn the Apple Watch blood oxygen ban. Undeterred, Apple told TechRadar in a statement: \"We thank the jury for their careful consideration in this case, finding Masimo willfully infringed Apple\u2019s patented designs. Teams at Apple worked for years to develop Apple Watch, a successful and innovative product that meaningfully impacts users\u2019 lives. Masimo took shortcuts, launching a device that copies Apple Watch and infringes our intellectual property. We are glad the jury's decision today will protect the innovations we advance on behalf of our customers.\u201d\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWithout that ruling, Apple's options for getting the ban overturned remain limited. However, there is still some hope. As reported earlier this month, Masimo has a new CEO, and that could open the door for a deal between the two companies.\nAs reported by Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the previous CEO Joe Kiani was a vocal critic of Apple, suggesting that the new CEO could be more amicable. With no legal reprieve in sight for Apple, a licensing deal between the two companies could be the only way blood oxygen returns to the Apple Watch in the US.\nYou may also like\nStephen Warwick is TechRadar's Fitness & Wearables writer with nearly a decade of experience covering technology, including five years as the News Editor of iMore.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nA few hours with the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is enough to confirm that it's an improvement on the stellar original - albeit only an incremental one, specs-wise. That's probably enough to make it the best Apple Watch ever, though, and its screen is amazing.\nPros\n- +\nNew S9 chipset\n- +\nDouble Tap gestures\n- +\nApple\u2019s brightest display ever\nCons\n- -\nVery few new features\n- -\nNo battery life extension\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nApple Watch Ultra 2: One minute review\nThe original Apple Watch Ultra was the most radical redesign to the watch that Apple has ever attempted. It was something entirely new, a great innovation, one that was celebrated, and the best Apple Watch we'd ever seen. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is also very good, because it\u2019s mostly the same watch.\nIt has a brighter screen (Apple\u2019s brightest screen ever, in fact) but Apple\u2019s new S9 SiP chip and the watchOS 10 operating system are what\u2019s bringing most of the changes. The S9 chip, just like it does on the Apple Watch Series 9, allows for a selection of new features such as the impressive hands-free Double Tap control. This innovative new gesture allows you to start workouts, dismiss timers, answer calls and more, all hands-free.\nA smattering of other features, including Siri, no longer needed to connect to the cloud, while a couple of alterations to the Depth app round out the changes. It\u2019s also stepped up its eco credentials, with recycled materials both inside and outside the watch. New bands also share this ethos, with an increased emphasis on sustainability fostering new design.\nHowever, when it comes to the Apple Watch Ultra 2\u2019s core mission - an Apple Watch to take with you into the wilderness and under the sea - very little has changed. There has been no battery life extension, new workout functionalities, or navigation innovations you can\u2019t also get on the original Ultra thanks to watchOS 10. It\u2019s still an amazing Apple Watch - probably the best, in fact, from a specifications perspective, and a definite contender for our best smartwatch guide - but it\u2019s falling into the same cycle of small annual updates as the standard Apple Watch models.\nApple Watch Ultra 2: Specifications\n| Component | Apple Watch Ultra 2 |\n| Price | $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,399 |\n| Dimensions | 49 x 41 x 14 (mm) |\n| Weight | 61g |\n| Case/bezel | Titanium |\n| Display | 502 x 410 px poly-silicon always-on OLED Retina Display |\n| GPS | Yes (unspecified) |\n| Battery life | 36 hours |\n| Connection | Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi, LTE |\n| Water resistant | Yes, WR100 (diveproof) |\nApple Watch Ultra 2: Price and availability\n- $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,399\n- Only one model\n- Available now\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 is available now. Your purchasing journey is pretty straightforward, in comparison to the Apple Watch Series 9: while the Apple Watch Series 9 comes with a whole host of choice attached to it (which color? Which size? Which band? GPS or cellular?) there\u2019s just a single Apple Watch Ultra 2 to choose from.\nYou get one size, 49mm, and one color: it is standard Titanium, despite the rumors we\u2019d be seeing a Black or Midnight version. It packs LTE cellular connectivity as standard. The only meaningful choice you need to make while buying it is which band it comes with, but we\u2019ll get to those in more detail in the Design section below.\nIf the $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,399 price for the Watch Ultra 2 is too high, or you don't need the extra adventure-focused features, you can of course look at the Apple Watch 9 range instead. It's at a similar price point to the original Ultra, so there's no giant value-depreciating markup here.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIt's an expensive device, but with its premium titanium build, LTE connectivity, and advanced features you won't find outside the Ultra series, it's not awful from a value perspective \u2013 costing roughly the same, or less, than many premium Garmin devices designed for the same sort of adventures.\n- Value score: 3.5/5\nApple Watch Ultra 2: Design\n- Recycled Titanium casing\n- 3,000 nit Retina Display screen\n- Otherwise identical\nAt first glance, just like the Series 9, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is more or less identical to its predecessor. Both share the same solid titanium body, the protruding casing housing the digital crown and the side button, and the now-iconic orange Action button. Microphone and speaker placement also match the original exactly.\nThe key differences to look out for concern the screen and the bands. First off, the screen is even more beautiful than on the first version, capable of putting out an impressive 3,000 nits of brightness at full blast. It\u2019s Apple\u2019s brightest screen ever, the refresh rate is like water falling off a duck\u2019s back, and it\u2019s definitely Apple at its peak. It\u2019s probably the best smartwatch screen I\u2019ve ever seen in person from a purely technical standpoint.\nThis world-beating screen is brought to life with a new customizable Ultra-exclusive watch face, showing the seconds ticking away around the screen in a very clever fashion. Meanwhile, your favorite complications - for instance movement rings, a weather widget, temperature, and a compass setting - can be mixed-and-matched to display on the watch face itself.\nIt\u2019s a smart alternative to the Wayfinder watch face from last year, and looks particularly great in Night Mode - although, if I had to make a choice right now, the Wayfinder still looks better.\nHowever, that\u2019s pretty much everything we can say from a software design perspective, as most of the innovations present here are part of watchOS 10, which is also available on other Apple Watches. It\u2019s a shame there\u2019s nothing new or unique about what you can do with watchOS 10 and the Ultra 2\u2019s Action button: it\u2019s still programmable, able to map to different functions, but there\u2019s no exciting new feature using the button this time.\nThe bands are driven by the same environmentally friendly message that dominated this year\u2019s Apple releases. Like the original, three straps are available for the Ultra 2: Alpine, with a g-hook fastening, a nylon Trail strap, and a flouroelastomer Ocean band for dives.\nI got to handle the Trail strap, and the design has been slightly tweaked, with a more rounded, clean end to it. Like the Series 9\u2019s sport loops, the nylon band is made with some recycled wool now. The Alpine and Trail bands are emblazoned with a circle of green leaves on the packaging, signifying they\u2019re part of Apple\u2019s carbon neutral scheme, and this will also be made clear online. The watch\u2019s titanium casing is also made from 95% recycled titanium, an impressive number if nothing else.\n- Design score: 4.5/5\nApple Watch Ultra 2: Features\n- Last year's excellent adventuring suite\n- New Double Tap gesture\n- Night Mode switches on automatically\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 still has the same stand-out adventuring features its predecessor did, such as next-level GPS tracking, using the Action button to emit a warning siren for assistance, durability in high and low temperatures, and the Oceanic+ app, which turns the watch into a working dive computer. If you want to check that one out, we had a real diving instructor test the Apple Watch Ultra to see how it did.\nThe Depth app, which is different from the Oceanic+ as it\u2019s Apple\u2019s in-house dive function, allows you to access logs of previous dives more easily on the watch now. It also supports free diving, although I\u2019m unlikely to give that a serious go before I fully review the watch. The original Ultra\u2019s slick, infrared-looking Night Mode had to be switched on manually with the digital crown, but it now turns on automatically thanks to ambient light sensors under the screen.\nThat\u2019s it for adventuring gear, but in terms of other new features, the Double Tap gesture is the big winner here. Although it\u2019s not available until October and I wasn\u2019t able to try it on the Apple Watch Ultra 2, I was able to have a go with the feature on the Apple Watch Series 9, which uses the same chipset and sensor array.\nFor those not in the know, by raising the watch as if you\u2019re going to check the time and pinching your fingers twice, you can activate whatever widget or app you have open at any given time. If you\u2019ve got a workout loaded up, you can start or finish it, for example. I tried answering a phone call, dismissing a timer, and scrolling through the new watchOS 10 widget stack using the feature, and it\u2019s very impressive and easy to get to grips with. This could easily have been a useless gimmick, but Apple has made this a feature you\u2019ll probably use daily.\nOther new stuff involves the S9\u2019s use of its Ultra Wideband technology to improve the Find Devices functionality. If you use an iPhone 15, which is also equipped with Ultra Wideband, you can see not only the direction of your phone, but also how far away it is from you in feet. My live demonstration was great, but of course, at the moment it\u2019s predicated on you having access to both new devices. Ultra Wideband can also be used to control music on your Apple HomePod if you\u2019re nearby, which is useful, I guess - but this isn\u2019t a watch for staying at home. This is a watch for the great outdoors, and I would have liked to see more innovation here.\nNevertheless, with so many outstanding features from last year's Ultra and previous Apple Watches, it's hard to mark an Apple Watch down too much for being \"more of the same\".\n- Features score: 4/5\nApple Watch Ultra 2: Performance\n- Battery performs as expected\n- Brighter screen a pleasure\n- Accurate and fast GPS\nSince filing my hands-on review of the Ultra 2, which was based on just a few hours using the smartwatch, I\u2019ve been testing it more thoroughly, wearing it on several runs, during strength training workouts, while sleeping and otherwise putting it through its paces, paired with an iPhone 13 running iOS 17. As in my Apple Watch Series 9 review, I won\u2019t go too much into the changes ushered in by watchOS 10, save for saying I\u2019m slightly disappointed that a new functionality for the Action button hasn\u2019t really come to light.\nInstead, I want to focus on what the watch does well, which is pretty much anything you task it with. It\u2019s big, it\u2019s hardy and it lasts for longer than a standard Apple Watch. If it weren\u2019t for the size and weight of the watch, I\u2019d say sleep tracking is a viable prospect, but not everyone is going to want to wear this chonker overnight. It tracks my sleep well enough, and offers an accurate breakdown of my sleep trends, but it doesn\u2019t turn that into useful guidance in the way Fitbit and Garmin devices do with their Readiness scores.\nActivity tracking is a genuine pleasure. Brisk walks are logged onto my activity and movement rings automatically, and the rings themselves are an easy way to see, at a glance, whether I\u2019m hitting my goals for that day. The Apple Watch\u2019s workout modes can be set up so that you can start a workout with the Action button, which is great for runners and skiers wearing gloves, or anyone with sweaty hands that aren\u2019t conducive to using a touchscreen, but the real pleasure for me is using the Strength Training workout profiles to build myself Custom Workouts with rest and work segments.\nYou can switch between segments with a press of the Action button, so no wiping your touchscreen with sweaty fingers. This is the first smartwatch I\u2019ve worn which I feel is genuinely useful in a gym environment; with others, strength training feels like an afterthought.\nRunning is also a joy, with the watch retaining last year\u2019s more-accurate-than-ever GPS and watchOS 9\u2019s running power innovation. The ambient light sensor switching to Night Mode automatically, a change from last year, is especially effective to avoid dazzling your eyes during winter evening jogs. The brighter screen is also a nice option to have, although in my experience I\u2019ve never needed more than 2,000 nits from a watch to help myself see it clearly, even in direct sunlight.\nBattery life performs as described, 36 hours or even longer, and that\u2019s including a 45-minute run thrown in there. It\u2019ll be a pleasure to use if you\u2019re coming from a standard Apple watch, but a two-day charge is still a stark difference compared with some of the sportier Garmins, with which the Ultra shares so much DNA. The battery is still far too short-lived to take on multi-day camping or trail events, unless you put the watch in low-power mode.\nThe main changes facilitated by the watch\u2019s S9 chip, the Double Tap and the new Find Devices feature, are fantastic. I trialed them in the Apple offices, but at the time of writing they\u2019re unavailable for use, and are due to arrive on the Watch Ultra 2 and Apple Watch 9 later in the year. The improved Find Devices feature using the Ultra Wideband frequency is extremely accurate and intuitive to use, and although it\u2019s only available when combined with the iPhone 15 series right now, it feels like future proofing.\nDouble Tap, on the other hand, has the potential to change the way you use your Apple Watch on a daily basis right now. This simple gesture will be very useful if you\u2019re in a position in which you don\u2019t want to touch your watch, whether that\u2019s cooking, exercising in the gym, or even something truly out there like skiing. Just like the Action buttons, the multiple applications of the feature (it activates whatever the main action is on whichever complication you have open) keep it very useful, and it was fast and responsive during my initial tests.\n- Performance score: 4/5\nApple Watch Ultra 2: Scorecard\n| Category | Comment | Score |\n| Value | Equivalent to last year's Apple Watch Ultra and representative of build quality. | 3.5/5 |\n| Design | A sumptuous screen, more eco credentials and a tough titanium exterior. | 4.5/5 |\n| Features | New Double Tap features and the S9 chip join all last year's outstanding adventuring tools. | 4/5 |\n| Performance | Battery performs as described, and everything on the watch is easy and ergonomic to use. | 4/5 |\n| Total | Another outstanding premium Apple Watch to take with you into the wild, even though it doesn't innovate on the original. | 4.5/5 |\nApple Watch Ultra 2: Should I buy?\nBuy it if...\nYou\u2019re due for an upgrade\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 is a beautiful piece of kit, but is not worth upgrading to if you\u2019ve already got the original Ultra.\nYou love adventure\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 is durable thanks to its titanium casing, and tweaked to operate in tough conditions better than a standard Apple Watch.\nYou need extra battery\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 retains the 36-hour battery life of its predecessor, double that of a standard Apple Watch.
