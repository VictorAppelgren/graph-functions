      "feedback": "Your draft is on the right track but needs tighter causal logic, sharper numeric triggers, and stricter citation discipline. 1) Replace vague “Fed rate cut + small‑cap rally” with concrete thresholds: e.g., a 50 bp Fed cut in September (C22MKA9VY) and Russell 2000 outperformance > 5 % vs S&P 500 (Q7VVGNSQE). 2) Quantify ACMR’s upside by tying it to a Q3 earnings beat that exceeds the $30 m net‑income target and N2 bubbling adoption in > 20 % of advanced‑node fabs (SK994CBWR). 3) For the downside, anchor the trigger to a Fed‑cut delay (C22MKA9VY) and a 10 % drop in China sales volume (SK994CBWR), and use CPI 2.7 % in July (LZG5YWQMC) plus S&P reaction (V7GV8YBQU) as concrete warning signs. 4) Assign probabilities that reflect source weight: e.g., 65 % for the Fed cut scenario, 35 % for a delay; 70 % for ACMR hitting upper guidance, 30 % for staying at lower guidance. 5) Ensure each line is a single sentence, no filler, and every fact that is not common knowledge carries an ID citation. 6) Reconcile conflicting signals by explicitly stating that the Fed cut probability is higher than the no‑cut probability, and that export‑control tightening (SK994CBWR) is a secondary, lower‑probability risk. 7) Finally, double‑check that all critical sources (SK994CBWR, C22MKA9VY, Q7VVGNSQE, LZG5YWQMC, V7GV8YBQU, J99EM2TPZ) are cited at least once for the key numbers you use.",
