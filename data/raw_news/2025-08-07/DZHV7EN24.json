  "description": "Polymarket leans into dildo throwing trend at WNBA games. Critics say it's disrespectful. The betting platform's promotion could encourage even more copycat incidents.",
  "content": "Critics are calling out Polymarket after it promoted bets on whether or not Women\u2019s pro basketball games will be interrupted by someone in the crowd throwing a dildo onto the court.\n\n\u201cAnnouncing: Dildo dailies,\u201d the Polymarket Sports X account posted on Wednesday. \u201cYou can now bet on which day(s) dildos will hit the WNBA court.\u201d\n\nSo far, bettors have traded almost $500,000 worth of bets on which games will be interrupted by sex toys being hurdled at the female athletes, even going as far as to bet on the colour of the martial aids.\n\nYet many were not enthused by the new opportunity.\n\n\u201cThis is so disrespectful to the women professionals who play in the WNBA,\u201d one person said in response to the post. \u201cImagine this was your daughter or sister and they played in the WNBA and this was being done at their games.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis type of stuff literally incentivises people to throw dildos onto the court,\u201d said another.\n\nIt comes after a man was arrested at a Phoenix Mercury game on August 5 after throwing a dildo towards the court, allegedly hitting a man and his nine-year-old niece.\n\nIt\u2019s the second arrest since July 29, when a sex toy was first thrown onto the court during a Women\u2019s National Basketball Association game between the Golden State Valkyries and the Atlanta Dream.\n\nThe promotion of betting surrounding the sexist trend could encourage even more copycat incidents, critics say.\n\nBoth arrested alleged dildo throwers said they pulled the stunts in an attempt to go viral on social media.\n\nTo be sure, Polymarket isn\u2019t the only platform letting users bet on WNBA games being disrupted by sex toys.\n\nBetOnline, an online gambling firm that was among the first to let gamblers bet with Bitcoin in its online poker rooms, also offers a range of similar dildo-based bets.\n\nPolymarket jumping on the dildo throwing trend also feeds into claims that crypto has a misogyny problem.\n\nA 2024 report from Association for Women in Cryptocurrency found that 82% of approximately 400 women surveyed believed the industry is not free from harassment.\n\nMultiple women have spoken out about alleged sexual misconduct and said the crypto industry suffers from a culture of sexism.\n\nIt\u2019s also another setback for Polymarket, which has been hit by several controversies in recent months.\n\nIn June, bettors came to blows over the disputed outcome of a betting market that asked if Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky had worn a suit.\n\nIn January, the betting platform faced backlash after it let users gamble on the level of destruction wrought by the California wildfires.",

  "summary": "Critics are criticizing Polymarket for promoting bets on whether or not pro basketball games will be interrupted by someone throwing a dildo onto the court during games. The company's Sports X account posted a message on its website stating that it would allow users to bet on which day(s) dildos will hit the WNBA court. So far, nearly $500,000 has been traded in bets on which games will occur when sex toys are thrown at female athletes. Critics have criticised the promotion, claiming it could encourage more copycat incidents of such incidents. This comes after a second man was arrested at a Phoenix Mercury game on August 5 after allegedly throwing a sex toy towards the court, which allegedly hit a man and his nine-year-old niece. The move comes as another setback for Polymarket, which has been hit by several controversies in recent months.",

      "text": "- A Polymarket bet has seen users clash against each other.\n- The $14 million bet concerns whether Zelenskyy wore a suit at a NATO summit.\n- It\u2019s not the first contested bet on the prediction market.\nWhat was Volodymyr Zelenskyy wearing at the recent NATO Summit on June 24?\nThat depends on who you ask.\nBettors on Polymarket, the crypto-based betting platform, are split on the outcome of a prediction market for whether the Ukrainian President would wear a suit in June.\nZelenskyy appeared at the NATO summit in The Hague on June 24 wearing a black blazer, collared shirt, and suit pants.\nMost media outlets that reported on the event said that Zelenskyy wore a suit.\nYet for those who traded more than $14 million worth of bets on the Ukrainian President\u2019s wardrobe choices, the outcome wasn\u2019t so clear.\nWith such a large amount of cash riding on the market, bettors on both sides are extremely motivated to convince others of their point of view.\nThe dispute throws into question the fairness and impartiality of prediction market outcomes, especially when they deal with situations that are open to interpretation.\nThe timing of the setback also mars Polymarket\u2019s recent winning streak.\nNot only did it ink a partnership with X in June, but it is also reportedly on the cusp of announcing the completion of a $200 million funding round, said to push its valuation to $1 billion.\nThat would put it at half the size of rival Kalshi, whose CEO announced a $185 million funding deal, valuing the company at $2 billion, on June 25.\nPolymarket did not respond to a request for comment.\nSimilar outfit\nOn one side, bettors argue that the dispute should be resolved in favour of \u2018yes\u2019 because the media widely reported that the Ukrainian President wore a suit, and that, by most definitions, a suit jacket, collared shirt, and suit pants constitute wearing a suit.\n\u201cThe Polymarket criteria do not ask you whether or not you believe it is a suit; they ask if the media believes it is a suit \u2014 and there is overwhelming evidence that that is the case,\u201d Calvin Hamilton, a UMA community member, said on Discord.\nUMA is a partner DeFi protocol that acts as a final arbiter of controversial markets on Polymarket.\nThe other side argues that Zelenskyy didn\u2019t wear a suit, citing that the blazer he wore was more stylised than a typical suit jacket, and that he didn\u2019t wear a tie.\nThey also point out that Zelenskyy previously wore a similar outfit in May. At that time, UMA decided it wasn\u2019t a suit.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same type of \u2018jacket/coat\u2019 as in the market that was ruled in June,\u201d one UMA community member posting under the name bluelaminate said on Discord. \u201cThat market has resolved to No. Clearly nothing has changed and this is not a \u2018suit\u2019 per definition.\u201d\nBetting on whether or not Zelenskyy will wear a suit has become popular in recent months.\nThe Ukrainian President has consistently made a point of wearing military fatigues as an act of solidarity with Ukrainian soldiers, even at formal events.\nBut in February, Zelenskyy was chided for not wearing a suit by Brian Glenn, chief White House correspondent for conservative cable network Real America\u2019s Voice, during a meeting with President Donald Trump.\nSince then, speculation that Zelenskyy might don a suit has abounded.\nSolving disputes\nWhen prediction market outcomes on Polymarket are disputed, the platform delegates decision-making to UMA.\nUMA tokenholders vote to settle questions of fact. The idea is that collective wisdom is the best way to get at the truth.\nVotes are cast in secret and only revealed after polling ends. And if the majority of tokenholders vote that A is true, those who said B is true face a financial penalty \u2014 a way to discourage voting for obvious untruths.\nUMA has resolved thousands of disputes without incident.\nHowever, some \u2014 especially those open to multiple interpretations \u2014 have sharply criticised the protocol.\nCritics suggest the system is open to abuse.\nThere\u2019s little stopping large UMA tokenholders colluding with Polymarket bettors behind the scenes to rig the outcomes of ambiguous prediction markets in their favour, as long as they know they have enough collective voting power to get their way.\nUMA CEO Hart Lambur told DL News he hasn\u2019t seen any evidence of collusion.\n\u201cUMA token holders want the UMA token to go up in value, and if it\u2019s a broken or manipulated system, the UMA token becomes worthless,\u201d he said. \u201cUMA voters have a strong incentive to follow Polymarket\u2019s rules and do the best job they can for the long run health of the system.\u201d\nGrowing issue\nIt\u2019s not the first time bettors have come to blows over market outcomes.\nIn fact, it\u2019s becoming a regular occurrence.\nIn March, bettors disagreed on the outcome of a $7 million bet over a potential Ukraine-US mineral deal. The prediction market resolved to yes despite no official agreement between the two nations.\nIn January, many Polymarket bettors again cried foul after losing a $120 million bet that social media platform TikTok wouldn\u2019t be banned before May.\nUpdate, June 30: Added a comment from UMA CEO Hart Lambur.\nUpdate, July 2: This article previously incorrectly stated Volodymyr Zelenskyy wore a similar suit outfit in February. It has been changed to the correct month, which was May.\nTim Craig is DL News\u2019 Edinburgh-based DeFi correspondent. Reach out to him with tips at tim@dlnews.com."

      "text": "One online gambling website has offered six vulgar bets after two WNBA games have been interrupted by flying sex toys about the next possible instance of the unique disruption.\nBetOnline.ag has six futures bets about a possible next act for sex toys at a WNBA game, which could all be combined into a parlay.\nOne bet asks for the color of the sex toy, with six different options, should the device not be green, like the previous two disruptions. A separate bet asks whether it will be green at all.\nAnother bet asks how the sex toy will be handled first by whoever takes it off the court, with hands or feet being the options.\nA third wager asks which half of the court will be the landing spot for the dildo - the home team's or the away side.\nA sport crossover bet asks if the next sex toy thrown onto the court at a WNBA game will be the same color as the Gatorade poured on Philadelphia Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni after he led his team to victory in February's Super Bowl.\nOne website has offered vulgar bets after two WNBA games have been interrupted by sex toys\nA WNBA game was halted after a sex toy was thrown on court for the second time in a week\nSky star Kamilla Cardoso saw the funny side as she joked about the incident with teammates\nIn shocking scenes during the Chicago Sky's game against the Golden State Valkyries on Friday, the sex object was hurled from the stands during the third quarter.\nOfficials swiftly stopped the game and swept the bright green object aside, as players and coaches stood bemused at the bizarre incident.\nThe commentators were equally as puzzled as they said: 'We have a whistle away from the basketball. An object has been thrown onto the court'.\nSky star Kamilla Cardoso, however, evidently saw the funny side to the incident after being seen giggling with teammates while they game was brought to a stop.\nOfficials eventually swept the fluorescent green object to the side before one team member picked it up - using a towel - and disposed of it.\nIt's fair to say that officials handled the situation with far more efficiency compared to the incident that occurred just four days before.\nDuring the Atlanta Dream's clash against Valkyries on Tuesday night, a similar looking object was thrown from the stands however officials let the possession continue.\nEventually, once the possession came to an end, officials brought an abrupt halt to the game as they addressed the bizarre situation.\nA WNBA game was halted after a sex toy was thrown on court for the second time in a week\nOfficials swiftly stopped the game before kicking the object to the side at the Wintrust Arena\nTuesday's game between the Dream and Valkyries also had an on-court disruption incident\nPlayers, coaches and fans were left bemused by the incident and evidently so were the broadcast team, who briefly cut to a close up of the sex toy.\nEventually, after a minute of deliberation, the sex toy was collected by a police officer who had been courtside and was taken away.\nFootage appeared to show the officer being handed a piece of cloth by a fan, in order to pick up the lewd object.\nThe betting website appears to have removed the WNBA futures bets about the sex toy on Saturday afternoon."

      "text": "- Hana told DL News how a work meeting turned into a nightmare.\n- CCTV footage showed a senior crypto exec spiking her cocktail.\n- The episode casts a harsh light on crypto's gender equality problem.\nIn late October, Hana arrived at a brightly-lit bar in Hong Kong.\nThe 27-year-old, who was in town from Tokyo to try to land a job in the crypto industry, sat down with a partner at DWF Labs, one of the industry\u2019s higher-powered investment and market-making firms.\nAfter she and the partner ordered drinks, Hana briefly went to the bathroom. Hana told DL News the man was Eugene Ng.\nThe partner took something out of his pocket and tipped it into her cocktail glass, according to security camera footage posted online. When Hana came back from the bathroom she drank from the cocktail.\nOn Tuesday, Hana, who declined to provide her real name to protect her privacy, posted a still from the footage on X.\n\u201cI never thought I\u2019d personally experience something like this,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOn the evening of October 24th, I was drugged by a partner at @DWFLabs.\u201d\nPredatory behaviour\nHana\u2019s post went viral and received more than 6 million views. Women in crypto \u2014 and some men \u2014 flooded Hana with messages of their own experiences of harassment.\n\u201cSome of those crypto bros embody the most predatory aspects of both tech and finance cultures, treating women they see as \u2018huntable\u2019 with unpredictable crimes,\u201d one prominent crypto investor posted on X.\nHana managed to escape her would-be attacker and reported the incident to the Hong Kong police.\n\u2018I\u2019ve had people tell me, \u2018Oh, this is just crypto, you shouldn\u2019t be so conservative.\u2019\n\u2014 Hana\nWhile DWF Labs did not publicly identify the partner, the firm acted quickly.\n\u201cWhile the matter is under investigation, DWF Labs has decided to dismiss the said partner from management and operational roles effective immediately,\u201d the crypto firm posted on Tuesday. Eugene Ng\u2019s profile was removed from DWF Labs\u2019 website.\nNg\u2019s X account went private, and his LinkedIn profile appeared to have been deleted. Ng did not respond to a request for comment from DL News.\nOn Friday, Andrei Grachev, managing director for DWF Labs, conceded on X that the partner was Ng and said he and his team were considering \u201cfurther legal actions against Eugene.\u201d\nGrachev didn\u2019t respond to a message on X asking for further comment.\nFor Hana, it\u2019s vital that what happened to her is not dismissed as just another isolated incident.\nShe wants to raise awareness about the culture of harassment that plagues women in finance, tech, and crypto.\n\u201cEver since I started to look into a job opportunity in this industry, or just getting to know people in this space, I\u2019ve met people, creepy people, a lot of them,\u201d Hana said.\nCultures of sexism\nLike Wall Street and Silicon Valley, the crypto industry has a gender equality problem.\nThe 17 richest crypto billionaires are all men, according to a recent tally from Forbes.\nMen outnumbered women speakers almost nine to one at the Bitcoin 2024 conference, according to data previously compiled by DL News.\nAnd a recent report from Association for Women in Cryptocurrency found that 82% of approximately 400 women surveyed believe the industry is not free from harassment.\nNumbers vary on the proportion of women who experience sexual harassment in the workplace, but it\u2019s clear the problem is pervasive. Hana is no exception.\nNetworking\nEarlier this year, Hana decided to find a job in the industry. So, she attended conferences.\nDuring her attempts to network, some men unexpectedly brought up sex. When she expressed her discomfort, they laughed off her concerns, she said.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had people tell me, \u2018Oh, this is just crypto, you shouldn\u2019t be so conservative,\u2019\u201d she said.\nSome have even told her that sex is \u201canother way to know each other better,\u201d she added.\n\u2018My ultimate goal for everything I\u2019ve done, it\u2019s to just raise awareness.\u2019\n\u2014 Hana\nIt was at one of these conferences in Hong Kong where she met Ng. They kept in touch, so when she returned to the city on October 24, it was natural to meet up for drinks.\nAfter Ng allegedly spiked her cocktail, a server rushed over to warn Hana that other drinkers had seen him do it.\nThat was only after she had sipped from her cocktail. Head spinning, she exited the bar and tried to get an Uber, to no avail. Ng stayed close to her, propping her up as she struggled to find her balance, she said.\nHana finally managed to escape from Ng in a taxi.\nFear of retaliation\nEven as Hana decided to go public with her harrowing ordeal, she feared some form of retaliation from Ng, she said. Steeling herself, she drafted her post.\nHana said she\u2019s overwhelmed and grateful for the support she\u2019s found online.\n\u201cMy ultimate goal for everything I\u2019ve done, it\u2019s to just raise awareness,\u201d she said.\nIn a way, she said, she\u2019s been given an opportunity.\nNow she\u2019s left turning over the \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios in her mind.\nWhat if the cocktail server had not warned her about the spiked drink?\nWhat if Ng had gotten her into a cab?\nWhat if she\u2019d woken up in a strange hotel room?\nHana told DL News that she may have been too afraid of the consequences to report an assault.\n\u201cProbably, I would just shut up and then nothing would happen to these disgusting people,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI believe I have to do this because I\u2019m lucky. I\u2019m the lucky one.\u201d\nJoanna Wright is DL News\u2019 regulatory correspondent. Contact her at joanna@dlnews.com. Ben Weiss is DL News\u2019 Dubai-based correspondent.

      "text": "Polymarket faces backlash over \u2018sick\u2019 California wildfire markets\nPolymarket is facing backlash over its \u201cdisgusting\u201d prediction markets that are currently betting on the outcomes of the ongoing California wildfires.\nThe fires started in the Hollywood hills on Wednesday and spread across Los Angeles. A total of five deadly fires have caused the evacuation of over 137,000 people and the deaths of five.\nMultiple Polymarket users have used the opportunity to create various prediction markets on the spread of the fire, when it will be contained, and potential political resignations. The volume has reached almost $100,000 in some of the markets.\nRead more: LA wildfires threaten crypto companies in southern California\nHowever, many online aren\u2019t impressed with the markets and Polymarket\u2019s promotion of them. \u201cBetting on a wildfire is sick,\u201d claimed one X user, while another said that betting on such a tragedy \u201cis unarguably uncouth beyond fucking measure.\u201d\nSome users raised concerns that a wildfire prediction market may incentivize bettors to start more fires in the hope that it might make their bet succeed. One noted that the market odds are based entirely on bettor sentiment, and in response to a post by Polymarket, said \u201cNo, there is no \u201c48% chance it will spread\u201d, there are 48% of people betting on that to happen.\u201d\nThis type of backlash isn\u2019t new for Polymarket. It faced a similar outcry last year when the Titan submersible market saw punters bet on whether or not the craft would implode and kill its five passengers.\nRead more: Polymarket faces US probe as Kalshi exec allegedly fuels wash-trading concerns\nTo somehow mitigate its role in at least 10 different wildfire markets, Polymarket has placed a short disclaimer claiming it uses the \u201cwisdom of the crowd\u201d to create \u201caccurate, unbiased forecasts\u201d on events.\nIt said, \u201cThe devasting Pacific Palisades fire is one such event, for which Polymarket can yield invaluable real-time answers to those directly impacted in ways traditional media cannot.\u201d\nIt\u2019s worth noting that if you\u2019re ever affected by a wildfire, it\u2019s probably not wise to turn to a crypto prediction site for information over a news organization actively covering the events.\nProtos reached out to Polymarket for comment and will update if we hear back.\nGot a tip?

      "text": "A third dildo found its way onto a WNBA court on Tuesday, August 5, interrupting the Indiana Fever and Los Angeles Sparks game. This marks the third incident in the last 10 days, so the question begs: What is going on with all the dildos at WNBA games? The answer: Nothing good.\nThis dildo throwing trend began July 29, during a game between the Golden State Valkyries and the Atlanta Dream, when a neon green dildo flew onto the court and bounced to the sideline. A nearly identical incident occurred just a few days later on August 1, when the Valkyries were playing the Chicago Sky. Now it\u2019s happened again. And it\u2019s getting worse.\nIt appears that this action is becoming more than just a one-time attempt at a joke, but a targeted attack on certain female players. On Friday, following the second incident, Fever player Sophie Cunningham tweeted, \u201cStop throwing dildos on the court... you\u2019re going to hurt one of us.\u201d She was nearly hit by the flying phallus four days later.\nThe very same night, someone reportedly attempted to throw a green dildo on the court at a New York City Liberty game, but failed to make it onto the court. (The dildo did, however, nearly hit a child, according to the user who shared video of the aftermath on social media.)\nNo suspects in the last two incidents have been identified, but Delbert Carver, a 23-year-old, was arrested in relation to the first dildo incident in Atlanta. According to ESPN, he could potentially face charges of disorderly conduct, public indecent/indecent exposure, and criminal trespass. In an affidavit, the man allegedly said that it was \u201csupposed to be a joke\u201d and \u201cgo viral.\u201d\nBut throwing dildos in the middle of a WNBA game isn\u2019t just a sad excuse for a prank\u2014it\u2019s a trend now, and it\u2019s targeting the WNBA as a whole.\nLet\u2019s think this through: There are people paying good money to attend a professional basketball game just to throw a dildo at the players\u2019 feet. Why? To send a message; to tell women that they don\u2019t belong on the court and that their athleticism isn\u2019t as valuable as their sexuality. This is misogyny, plain and simple.\nA few WNBA players have spoken out against the incidents, but as any woman can attest, it can be hard to call out sexism on an international scale. After the original incident, some\u2014like Fever Point Guard Sydney Colton\u2014responded with humor.\nNow that it\u2019s become a trend, most players aren\u2019t feeling so generous. Following the dildo throw at Friday\u2019s game, Chicago Sky center Elizabeth Williams called it \u201cdisrespectful\u201d during a postgame press conference, adding that \u201cwhoever is doing it needs to grow up.\u201d\nNew York Liberty Power Forward Isabelle Harrison also weighed in Friday, tweeting in part, \u201cIt\u2019s not funny. Never was funny. Throwing ANYTHING on the court is so dangerous.\u201d\nAnd on Tuesday, Sparks coach Lynne Roberts told reporters it was \u201cridiculous.\u201d She continued, \u201cIt's also dangerous.\u201d\nBut here\u2019s the thing: We know that these idiots throwing dildos onto the court don\u2019t care about the players or coaches. They don\u2019t care about what women deserve or how disgusting and violating their actions are. It\u2019s time for NBA players to stand in solidarity with their female counterparts and call this behavior what it is: unacceptable, sexist, and detrimental to the entire sport."
