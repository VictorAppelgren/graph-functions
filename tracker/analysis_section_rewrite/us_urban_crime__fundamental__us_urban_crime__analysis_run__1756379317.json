      "feedback": "Your draft captures the broad strokes but falls short of a world‑class structural thesis.  First, it lacks a clear invariant anchor: you mention “real‑rate‑differentiate” but never tie it to a measurable differential (e.g., U.S. real interest rate vs. euro‑area real rate, or wage‑price index).  Quantify the ICE effect with data—cite ICE arrest counts (e.g., 214 in Houston, 80+ in Colorado) and estimate the resulting labor‑supply shock (e.g., 5–10 % decline in low‑wage employment).  Anchor the political polarization risk with a concrete metric (e.g., change in the Congressional Partisanship Index or the “policy uncertainty” index).  The causal chain should be diagrammed: ICE → labor supply ↓ → wages ↑ → CPI ↑ → real disposable income ↓ → consumption ↓ → risk premium ↑.  Include a base‑case range for inflation (3–4 %) and real rates (2–3 %) with explicit sources (e.g., Fed’s FOMC minutes, BLS wage data).  Cite all claims with IDs from the source material (e.g., R4I4J0MPK for LA noise, YATNAIHDT for Brooklyn shooting, MV8EDA73J for ICE arrests).  Finally, list key risks with specific triggers (e.g., ICE enforcement > 300 arrests/month, Partisanship Index > 0.6, violent‑crime rate > 500 per 100k).  Tighten the paragraph to 4–5 sentences, ensuring each claim is backed by a citation and a numeric range.",
