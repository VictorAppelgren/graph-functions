  "title": "Russia Holds Battlefield Advantage in Ukraine War",
  "description": "President Trump said that he and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia favor a comprehensive deal over the immediate cease-fire Ukraine wants. President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said he would meet with Mr. Trump in Washington on Monday.",
  "content": "President Trump said early on Saturday that he and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had discussed working toward a full peace deal in Ukraine instead of first agreeing to a cease-fire, a move that would give Russia an advantage in the talks. After returning from a summit in Alaska with Mr. Putin, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social that he had spoken by phone to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine and European leaders and that \u201cit was determined by all that the best way to end the horrific war between Russia and Ukraine is to go directly to a Peace Agreement, which would end the war, and not a mere Ceasefire Agreement, which often times do not hold up.\u201d But European leaders issued a statement that did not echo Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that peace talks were preferable to a cease-fire. In the statement, leaders of Britain, France and Germany and others welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to stop the war but threatened to increase economic penalties on Russia \u201cas long as the killing in Ukraine continues.\u201d Mr. Trump confirmed Mr. Zelensky\u2019s announcement earlier Saturday that the Ukrainian president would visit the White House on Monday. If that visit goes well, Mr. Trump said, he would schedule another meeting with Mr. Putin. Skipping cease-fire talks and going straight for a peace deal has been a demand of Mr. Putin\u2019s in the long diplomatic effort to reach an end to the war in Ukraine. With Russia advancing on the battlefield, a cease-fire would give Ukraine relief from Moscow\u2019s attacks and deprive Mr. Putin of that leverage at the bargaining table. Before his meeting with Mr. Putin in Alaska, Mr. Trump had agreed with European allies and Mr. Zelensky that no peace negotiations could begin without a cease-fire in place. Mr. Zelensky, who was left out of the summit, said in a statement that he and Mr. Trump would \u201cdiscuss all of the details regarding ending the killing and the war\u201d with Russia in his trip to Washington on Monday. Mr. Zelensky said that he had \u201chad a long and substantive conversation\u201d with Mr. Trump, who discussed his meeting Mr. Putin. In an interview with the Fox News host Sean Hannity after the summit, Mr. Trump put the onus for a cease-fire on Mr. Zelensky. \u201cNow it is really up to President Zelensky to get it done,\u201d he said. \u201cI would also say the European nations have to get involved a little bit.\u201d Moscow, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, has demanded that Ukraine cede a large part of its land to Russia, disarm, swear off joining NATO and change governments. At a joint news conference after their meeting in Alaska, Mr. Putin referred obliquely to agreements between Mr. Trump and himself, without elaborating, and added, \u201cWe expect that Kyiv and European capitals will perceive that constructively and will not throw a wrench in the works.\u201d The Russian leader also gave Mr. Trump a public relations boost, endorsing his oft-stated claim that if he had been in the White House, Russia would not have invaded Ukraine in 2022. Here\u2019s what else to know:\n\u2022 None Alaska summit: Mr. Trump and American officials divulged few details on Friday about the substance of the nearly three-hour meeting with Mr. Putin at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage. The summit broke up ahead of schedule. After their first meeting with a few aides and a meal break, Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin were expected to meet again with a larger circle of people. The second session appeared not to have taken place. Russian officials had said they expected the summit to last six or seven hours.\n\u2022 None Ukrainian concerns: Oleksandr Merezhko, chairman of the foreign affairs committee in the Ukrainian Parliament, said the meeting had been a public relations victory for Mr. Putin, who appeared as an equal to Mr. Trump, and \u201cused Trump to show that he is not isolated.\u201d Earlier in the day, Mr. Zelensky, who has warned that Mr. Putin did not want peace and would try to \u201cdeceive America,\u201d released a video in which he said of Russia: \u201cOn the day of negotiations, they are killing, as well. And that speaks volumes.\u201d\n\u2022 None The Trump-Putin relationship: The meeting was at least the seventh face-to-face encounter between the two leaders, and the first of Mr. Trump\u2019s second term. His first term was shadowed by questions over Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, which Mr. Trump has repeatedly referred to as \u201cthe Russia hoax.\u201d It was the first U.S. visit in a decade for Mr. Putin.\n\nA Ukrainian soldier firing at Russian targets in the Donetsk region in June. The area is part of the Donbas, which Moscow seeks to capture. Russia entered Friday\u2019s inconclusive talks with the United States from a position of strength on the battlefield in Ukraine. It is a position Russia is likely to keep exploiting, as President Trump on Saturday seemed to rule out any prospect of an imminent cease-fire. The Russian Army has driven a wedge into Ukrainian defenses in the east, and Ukrainian officials have warned that Moscow has massed forces and equipment for new offensive operations. In recent days, Russian forces broke through a section of Ukrainian defenses in the eastern Donbas region, an area that Moscow has long sought to capture but currently controls only about three-quarters of. Russian troops advanced about 10 miles deep into the Ukrainian rear, threatening to outflank Ukraine\u2019s positions. The Russian advance now appears to have been stopped, and in some areas even pushed back. But military analysts note that the breach could still provide Russia with a new staging ground for future attacks, advancing its broader goal of seizing the remainder of the Donbas. It is a stark contrast from the Kremlin\u2019s position more than three years ago, during early peace talks in Istanbul. Back then, Russia\u2019s army had made a failed attempt to capture Kyiv and was reeling from devastating Ukrainian counterattacks. Mr. Putin\u2019s initial plan \u2014 to swiftly seize all of Ukraine, decapitate its military and political leadership and replace it with Moscow-friendly authorities \u2014 had to be abandoned. Russian troops withdrew to the east and south, where they refocused the fighting. Since then, Russian forces have slowly but steadily captured Ukrainian territory. Since it launched its full-scale invasion in early 2022, Russia has captured roughly 27,000 square miles of territory in Ukraine, about the size of Ireland. This adds to the 17,000 square miles it already controlled from what is seen as the first phase of the war, which began in 2014. Altogether, Russia now controls nearly a fifth of Ukraine\u2019s territory. Ukraine holds a small sliver of land in the western Russian region of Kursk. That is a remnant of last year\u2019s incursion, when its troops captured thousands of square miles and held them for months before Russia pushed them back early this year. On other parts of the front line, Ukraine has been gradually retreating under relentless assaults. The Russian advance, however, has come at a steep price. About 230,000 Russian soldiers have died since the beginning of the invasion, according to estimates based on obituaries collected by the independent news outlet Mediazona and BBC News Russian. Ukrainian losses are estimated at less than half of Russia\u2019s. But Moscow has been able to rebuild and even expand its battered force by tapping into a population that is four times larger than Ukraine\u2019s. Meanwhile, Kyiv has struggled to replenish its army through conscription. This largely explains why Russia now has the upper hand on the battlefield. Ukraine doesn\u2019t have enough soldiers to hold its lines, allowing Russian troops to slip through, as they did in the east in recent days, near the city of Pokrovsk. The Ukrainian army rushed elite brigades to the area to halt the Russian advance. But many Ukrainian soldiers saw the Russian breach as a stark warning of what could happened in the coming months if Ukraine does not address its personnel shortages, lack of coordination between units and poorly planned counterattacks. \u201cThis disaster has been building for a long time, worsening day by day,\u201d Bohdan Krotevych, the former chief of staff of Ukraine\u2019s Azov brigade and a National Guard lieutenant colonel, wrote on social media.\n\nTrump and Putin had an isolated conversation in Trump\u2019s limo. President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Alaska on Friday. At the summit in Alaska on Friday between President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, before their formal discussions on Ukraine, the two leaders had a brief conversation isolated from any aides or journalists in the U.S. president\u2019s limousine. In the apparently unplanned encounter, they were accompanied only by two security officers in the front of the eight-ton armored car. It left many wondering: What exactly did they talk about? The two leaders were set to be picked up separately after they descended from their planes. Mr. Putin\u2019s own presidential limousine was ready on the tarmac. But after they greeted each other, Mr. Trump gestured for Mr. Putin to walk with him toward the American presidential vehicle. They slipped into the back of the limousine, called the Beast, and rode together to the nearby military facility where the talks would take place. As the car drove away, news cameras captured Mr. Putin flashing a wide smile and waving his hand. Other world leaders have been offered rides in the Beast in the past, but it is unusual for someone from a rival country to be invited, especially with no one else. There did not appear to be any interpreters in the car with Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin on Friday. Mr. Putin is known to speak English well enough to hold a conversation. Neither leader has shared what was said during that short ride, and it remained unknown hours later. It has added to the mystery of what they discuss in private, much like their meeting in Hamburg, Germany, in 2017, at the beginning of Mr. Trump\u2019s first term. After that meeting, Mr. Trump never revealed publicly what was discussed. His secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, and Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, were the only others in the room aside from the interpreters. Mr. Trump also took away his interpreter\u2019s notes. During that visit to Germany for a Group of 20 leaders meeting, Mr. Trump pulled up a chair next to Mr. Putin at a dinner to talk. No American officials were present, and the White House did not confirm the exchange until more than 10 days later, after it had been independently reported.\n\nThe U.S. was one of the few Western nations Putin could visit without risking arrest. The International Criminal Court has accused President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia of war crimes. When the International Criminal Court accused President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia of war crimes in 2023 and issued a warrant for his arrest, the move was largely symbolic because there was little chance he would stand trial. But it immediately jeopardized Mr. Putin\u2019s ability to travel to the more than 120 countries that have signed on to the I.C.C. They include almost every nation in Europe and dozens more in Africa, Asia and Latin America. They are all legally required to arrest Mr. Putin and send him to The Hague if he sets foot on their soil. But Mr. Putin\u2019s visit to Alaska on Friday highlighted a notable exception. To prevent the world\u2019s highest criminal court from being used to prosecute Americans, the United States has long refused to join the I.C.C., created over 20 years ago under the 1998 Rome Statute to handle accusations of crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide. As a result, the United States is virtually the only country in the West that Mr. Putin can visit without worrying about arrest. Only a handful of other major powers, including China, India, Russia and Israel, have abstained from becoming signatories to the court. Even before the I.C.C. warrant for Mr. Putin was issued, it had been rare for him to travel abroad. He spent the first two years of the Covid pandemic in Russia, a period of isolation that some U.S. intelligence officials speculated might have heightened his appetite for risk and influenced his decision to launch the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The I.C.C. has accused Mr. Putin of bearing criminal responsibility for the abduction and deportation of Ukrainian children after Russia launched its invasion. But the court cannot try absent defendants, and Russia, which is not a party to the I.C.C., has dismissed the warrants as \u201cmeaningless.\u201d Though the court has no enforcement mechanism, the symbolic weight of its arrest warrant for Mr. Putin has forced members and nonmembers alike to decide whether they are willing to take the diplomatic risk of hosting a wanted man. That risk has not been enough to stop several countries that are friendly with Moscow \u2014 or reliant on it \u2014 from welcoming Mr. Putin. Since 2023, he has made repeated visits to China, Belarus and several Central Asian countries. In September, he was given a red-carpet welcome in Mongolia, which is a party to the I.C.C. but depends on neighboring Russia for most of its fuel. Mongolia isn\u2019t the only country to have defied its obligation to the court. South Africa did so in 2015, when it allowed Omar Hassan al-Bashir, then the Sudanese president, to fly in and out of Johannesburg while he was wanted by the I.C.C. on accusations of genocide and war crimes in his country\u2019s Darfur region. Mr. Bashir remains at large, a prominent example of the court\u2019s limitations. Last year, South Africa faced a dilemma over whether to permit Mr. Putin to attend the annual summit of BRICS nations. After months of speculation, the Kremlin announced that Mr. Putin would attend remotely. Mr. Putin is one of only a few sitting leaders facing an outstanding arrest warrant from the I.C.C. Another is Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, whom the court last year accused of carrying out war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s office has categorically rejected what it called \u201cabsurd and false accusations.\u201d The United States, Israel\u2019s chief ally, also denounced the I.C.C. warrant for Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s arrest, and President Trump has since hosted the Israeli leader three times at the White House.\n\nPutin flatters Trump by echoing his claims about the war in Ukraine. President Trump with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia during a joint address in Anchorage on Friday. As President Trump has endeavored to stop the war between Russia and Ukraine, he has repeatedly described it as President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s war, and claimed it would have never started under his watch. Until Friday, when Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin met in Alaska to discuss the conflict, it seemed a boastful refrain that gave Mr. Trump cover for failing to stop a three-year-war he said he could stop within 24 hours of taking office. But, after the meeting, Mr. Putin made a point of echoing Mr. Trump\u2019s claim that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine in 2022 if he had still been president, a striking bit of flattery as the two men put on a show of warmth and friendship even as they walked away without a deal. \u201cToday we hear President Trump say, \u2018If I were president, there would be no war,\u2019\u201d Mr. Putin said. \u201cI think that would actually happen. I confirm this.\u201d \u201cI think that overall, me and President Trump have built a very good businesslike and trustworthy contact,\u201d he added, \u201cand have every reason to believe that moving down this path, we can come \u2014 and the sooner the better \u2014 to the end of the conflict in Ukraine.\u201d Mr. Trump regularly attacks his predecessor, Mr. Biden, and on Friday the Russian president did the same, saying: \u201cI tried to convince my previous American colleague the situation should not be brought to the point of no return when it would come to hostilities, and I said it quite directly back then, it\u2019s a big mistake.\u201d Like many world leaders, Mr. Putin appeared to embrace flattery when it comes to dealing with Mr. Trump. In addition to praising Mr. Trump as an earnest peacemaker, he commended the president for the \u201cwell wishing and trustworthy tone of our conversation.\u201d He said that a meeting between U.S. and Russian leaders were \u201clong overdue\" and commended Mr. Trump for caring about the prosperity of the United States as well as Russia\u2019s national interests. After Mr. Putin, a former K.G.B. officer, concluded his remarks, Mr. Trump called his statements \u201cprofound.\u201d But Mr. Trump had little to say after that. He announced no cease-fire deal, saying that he would report back to Ukraine and its allies what had been discussed.\n\nIn Russia, Putin\u2019s meeting with Trump plays as a triumph. President Trump with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. The leaders greeted one another warmly at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage. There was pronounced gloating in Russia over Friday\u2019s summit in Alaska, where President Vladimir V. Putin was given the red carpet treatment by President Trump on American soil and appeared to make a huge dent in more than three years of diplomatic isolation. Ending the war in Ukraine had been on the agenda, but neither Mr. Putin nor Mr. Trump announced a cease-fire deal after the nearly three-hour meeting. In fact, during the news conference afterward, the Russian leader made a reference to the \u201croot causes\u201d of the conflict. It was his shorthand for Russia\u2019s insistence that any threat from Kyiv as perceived by Moscow had to be removed, including seizing territory in eastern Ukraine and installing a government that was not hostile to the Kremlin. Mr. Putin\u2019s remarks showed that the Kremlin\u2019s position was \u201cunwavering,\u201d crowed Andrei Gurulyov, a retired general who is now a member of Russia\u2019s Parliament. Mr. Gurulyov, speaking on his Telegram channel, argued that the meeting could be called a breakthrough because Mr. Putin was able to explain \u201cface to face\u201d to Mr. Trump the reasons for the war. \u201cThe meeting of the presidents of Russia and the USA is a breakthrough already after what has been happening,\u201d he said. The joint appearance in Alaska occurred around 2 a.m. in Moscow, so there was limited reaction from Russian commentators and officials. But Russian state television started playing the joint appearance featuring Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump \u2014 where neither leader took questions \u2014 repeatedly, a sure sign that the Kremlin thought it had triumphed. The reports stressed the seemingly warm chemistry between the two leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s clear from the statements made by both presidents that a huge step forward has been made,\u201d said a correspondent reporting from Alaska on the state-run Rossiya 24 news channel. Another report on the channel noted that the entire meeting was likely to cause chagrin among American allies in Europe. It said: \u201cYou can understand Europeans: The red carpet and a warm, nearly friendly handshake can hardly fit into the narrative they have been working through for three years about Russia being a pariah country. And it looks like there will be no lack of such discoveries for the Old World.\u201d The official TASS news agency filed an urgent bulletin from the joint appearance to note that Mr. Putin, speaking in English, had invited Mr. Trump to hold their next meeting in Moscow. Mr. Trump was polite but noncommittal, calling the idea interesting but that he would \u201ctake a lot of heat for it.\u201d Russian critics of Mr. Putin and the war in Ukraine wondered if Mr. Trump would follow through on his previous threat to impose direct and secondary sanctions if Russia did not move to end the fighting. The Kremlin had asked for the meeting on the eve of the deadline Mr. Trump had set for the sanctions. \u201cNow the main question is what will happen with the previously announced sanctions?\u201d Abbas Gallyamov, a Russian political analyst, wrote on Telegram. \u201cWill Trump impose them and in what form? Without this, Putin will look like the winner.\u201d",

That includes stories about foreign policy, society, politics, migration, energy and more. I am particularly interested in stories about the experiences of everyday people in a rapidly changing Europe, and in covering governments\u2019 attempts to remake their economies, respond to growing populist movements and address major challenges like climate change.\nMy Background\nBefore moving to Germany, I covered economic policy in Washington for more than a dozen years, with a focus on the stagnation of the American middle class and the decline of economic opportunity in wide swaths of the country. I am the author of a book about those themes: \u201cThe Riches of This Land: The Untold, True Story of America\u2019s Middle Class,\u201d published in 2020.\nEarlier in my career, I worked at newspapers including The Oregonian, The Rocky Mountain News, The Blade (in Toledo, Ohio) and The Washington Post. In 2007, a colleague and I won the Livingston Award for Young Journalists for a series of stories exploring why the Ohio economy declined drastically over the course of a generation. Beyond economics, I\u2019ve covered education, elections, wildfires, state legislatures, capital murder trials, energy, climate and general features.\nI grew up in McMinnville, Oregon, and have a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science from Stanford University.

      "text": "I am a reporter at The New York Times covering Russia and the wider region.\nWhat I Cover\nI write about Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the countries of the Caucasus, and Central Asia, working on everyday news and bigger investigative projects and features. My ambition is to unpack this very complex region for our readers. To do that, I am committed to covering all aspects of life in Russia and beyond, including its rapid economic and cultural transformation and how it\u2019s impacting Russian society. I am especially interested in stories that can humanize our reader\u2019s understanding of what life is like in these countries.\nMy Background\nI have been covering Russia and the region as a journalist since 2013, when I started working for The Moscow Times and several independent Russian news outlets. I joined The Times in 2015 as a reporter and researcher in the Moscow bureau. Throughout the past decade, I have witnessed key events in the region, including the Sochi Olympics, Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea and the conflict in Ukraine\u2019s east, escalating tensions between Moscow and Washington, and the ongoing war in Ukraine.\nI come from a very mixed background that helps me see the story I cover from various angles. I was born in St. Petersburg, Russia, but spent much of my formative years being raised by my grandparents in the small town of Piatykhatky in central Ukraine. For seven years, I studied and worked in Canada and Britain, where I earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in international relations from the University of Calgary and a master\u2019s in international relations from the London School of Economics.\nJournalistic Ethics\nI am guided by our mission: we seek the truth and help people understand the world. The key word for me here is \u201cseek.\u201d I see journalism as a pursuit of answers and new questions. I always proceed with the humble assumption that I know very little about the world. I have dedicated a significant portion of my life to studying Russia, Ukraine, and the wider region, yet I cannot claim to have all the answers. I have never aligned myself as an activist in any cause and I have always been most interested in underreported stories and viewpoints that might go against the conventional wisdom. I do not accept gifts, money, or favors from anyone who might influence my reporting. Like all of my Times colleagues, I am committed to upholding the standards outlined in our Ethical Journalism Handbook.\nContact Me"

      "text": "Trump Administration to End Security Programs Protecting European Allies From Russia\nEnding the longstanding program is expected to impact hundreds of millions of dollars that have gone toward countries that border Russia.\nBy Erica L. Green\nAlong with the rest of the White House team, I cover the daily decisions, comings and goings and newsworthy events involving the president, the vice president and other members of his cabinet.\nWhile I am particularly interested in social policy and civil rights, I cover a range of topics spanning domestic and foreign policy. I\u2019m also drawn to stories that illustrate how the decisions made on Pennsylvania Avenue impact the American people, and shape the dynamics of American society. I look to broaden my coverage from beyond the Beltway to ensure that Americans are represented alongside the administration, which I believe is crucial to holding them accountable to the people they are elected to serve.\nI joined the White House beat in the summer of 2023, and covered the last year-and-a-half of the Biden administration, as well as the 2024 presidential campaign.\nBefore then, I covered education for 13 years, more than six of them at The Times. I started at The Times in 2017 to cover former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and federal education policy. Many of my stories focused on the political tumult that the nation\u2019s K-12 schools and higher education institutions navigated during Trump\u2019s first term. I also reported a myriad other features and investigations on school districts across the country, with a focus on civil rights and marginalized student populations, including the dismal educational outcomes for Native American students; the disproportionate disciplining of Black girls in school; and the secret and illegal suspensions of special education students. I also coauthored a Times investigation exposing the leaders of a Louisiana school who abused students and falsified their college applications to get them into the Ivy League. The story was the debut episode on The Times\u2019 television show \u201cThe Weekly,\u201d and is the subject of an upcoming book. In 2022, I was recognized as the best education beat reporter in the country by the Education Writers Association.\nBefore joining The Times, I covered education at my hometown paper, The Baltimore Sun, for seven years. While there, I was also part of the team named a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the death of Freddie Gray in police custody, and the riots that resulted. I coauthored a book about the riots, \u201cFive Days: The Fiery Reckoning of an American City,\u201d that documented the events.\nI graduated from Goucher College with a bachelor\u2019s degree in communications, and I received my master\u2019s degree in journalism from Northwestern University.\nMaintaining journalistic independence is important for every journalist at The Times, which has extensive ethics guidelines that I follow. I want all of my work to be accurate and fair. I go above and beyond to ensure that multiple viewpoints are heard and represented in my coverage, but I do not allow that to devolve into false equivalencies or distract from the irrefutable truths readers should know. I value the trust I build with my sources, and fiercely protect them. I do not accept gifts, money or favors from anyone who might figure into my reporting. I do not make political donations. When I am working, I always identify myself as a reporter for The Times. And I do not forget that with the great privilege of having a front-row seat to history comes the huge responsibility to report without fear or favor.\nEmail: erica.green@nytimes.com\nX: @EricaLG\nAnonymous tips: nytimes.com/tips\nEnding the longstanding program is expected to impact hundreds of millions of dollars that have gone toward countries that border Russia.\nBy Erica L.

      "text": "I have been a reporter for The New York Times since 1995, writing about a range of topics from war to politics to the arts, both internationally and in the United States.\nI have reported from Russia and across the Middle East extensively, interspersed with wide-ranging assignments in the United States, most recently writing about extremism. My goal has always been to convey life in different parts of the world \u2014 not just key political and economic issues, but matters like what people eat or what makes them laugh.\nI began covering the Ukraine war when it erupted in February 2022, following five years spent on assignment in Moscow from 2014-2019. I was part of the team awarded the 2017 Pulitzer Prize in international reporting for a series detailing the Kremlin\u2019s covert methods of exerting influence globally.\nMy Background\nI was based in Cairo for The Times from 2001-06, covering all the countries from Iran to Morocco, then roved around the region during the Arab uprisings from 2011-13. Before coming to The Times, I worked for seven years in the Middle East for The Associated Press, including stints as the news editor in Jerusalem and setting up an office in Kuwait after the 1991 Gulf War.\nI first decided that I wanted to be a reporter during my junior year at Stanford University, when I dropped most of my classes in order to write about the tension between the university and its clerical staff, which was seeking to unionize. That real-world skirmish seemed far more captivating than my classes in international relations theory. I grew up overseas, mostly in Libya, where my father worked as a chemical engineer, so reporting seemed a perfect way to pursue my interest in global affairs while also keeping one foot planted in the United States.\nI have written two books, a satirical novel about the international press corps during war, and another about how the Arab world is changing. I speak French and Arabic, while my Russian is always a work in progress.\nJournalistic Ethics\nAll Times journalists are committed to upholding the standards of integrity outlined in our Ethical Journalism Handbook. Every story should be accurate and fair. My reporting is not rooted in any personal agenda; I let the people and the voices that I encounter shape where the story goes. I always identify myself as a Times reporter when I\u2019m working. I do not donate to political campaigns or causes. Having often worked in repressive police states, I am careful to protect my sources, who can put themselves at great risk to share information with me.\nContact Me\nThe fastest way to contact me is through email. You can try social media, but when things get busy I often forget to check my messages there.\nMillions of Syrians from destroyed places like Daraya feel they did everything possible to overthrow the Assad government, but they still await reconstruction aid.\nPresident Trump says President Vladimir V.

But much remained unresolved.\nThe Lebanese militant group has lost much of its power since the recent war with Israel.

      "text": "He wasn\u2019t joking.\nWhen President Donald Trump was reminded in an interview with Time magazine this week that he had said he would end the Russian war on Ukraine on \u201cday one,\u201d he claimed he hadn\u2019t been speaking literally or seriously.\n\u201cWell, I said that figuratively, and I said that as an exaggeration, because to make a point, and you know, it gets, of course, by the fake news [unintelligible]. Obviously, people know that when I said that, it was said in jest, but it was also said that it will be ended,\u201d Trump said, according to Time\u2019s transcript.\nThis \u201cin jest\u201d claim is a lie.\nOn the campaign trail in 2023 and 2024, Trump said on dozens of occasions, in an entirely serious tone, manner and context, that he would end the war in Ukraine either within 24 hours of his return to the White House or even sooner than that. He said over and over again, including at both presidential debates of 2024, that he would have the war \u201csettled\u201d when he was president-elect, before his inauguration.\nA Friday search of the Roll Call Factba.se database that catalogues Trump\u2019s public remarks turned up at least 53 examples of Trump making such comments.\nIt\u2019s sometimes hard to determine the intent of a politician\u2019s one-time ad-libs, but this was no jovial ad-lib. Rather, the promise of a rapid end to the war was a sober staple of Trump\u2019s pre-written rally remarks. He framed the promise as a key component of his second-term agenda, and he justified it with claims about his \u201ccredibility\u201d as a leader, his history as a \u201cpeacemaker,\u201d and his knowledge of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\nTrump sometimes emphasized that he was speaking literally, scoffing at critics who said he couldn\u2019t end the war that fast. \u201cI\u2019ll get that done within 24 hours. Everyone says, \u2018Oh, no, you can\u2019t.\u2019 Absolutely I can. Absolutely I can,\u201d he said at one July 2023 rally in Iowa. He said at a Pennsylvania rally later that month: \u201cBefore I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after we all together win the presidency, we will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled. It will be settled. The war is going to be settled. I\u2019ll get them both \u2013 I know Zelensky, I know Putin, it\u2019ll be done within 24 hours, you watch. They all say, \u2018That\u2019s such a boast.\u2019 It will be done very quickly.\u201d\nHere are the 53 examples.

They both have weaknesses and they both have strengths. And within 24 hours that war will be settled. It will be over. It will be absolutely over.\u201d\nJune 10, 2023.

  "argos_summary": "President Trump and President Vladimir Putin met in Alaska and discussed a direct peace deal for Ukraine, bypassing a cease\u2011fire that would have weakened Russia\u2019s bargaining position. Trump asserted that a cease\u2011fire would give Ukraine relief and strip Russia of leverage, while European leaders warned of further sanctions if the war continued. Russian forces have advanced deep into eastern Ukraine, capturing about 27,000 square miles, but have also faced counter\u2011attacks and high casualties. The summit ended without concrete progress, leaving the conflict unresolved and Russia\u2019s battlefield advantage intact.",
