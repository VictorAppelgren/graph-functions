  "content": "On Friday, the FBI conducted a raid on the home and office of John Bolton, who served as the national security adviser during President Donald Trump\u2018s first term.\n\nWhat Happened: The raid is part of a high-profile investigation into allegations that Bolton transferred classified documents to his family using a private email server while he was in office.\n\nThe FBI agents first arrived at Bolton\u2019s residence in Bethesda, Maryland, early Friday morning. The probe, led by FBI Director Kash Patel, was later extended to Bolton\u2019s office in Washington, D.C., following the signing of a warrant by a judge.\n\nDespite the raid, Bolton has not been arrested or charged with any crimes, an administration official confirmed.\n\nThe investigation is centered around allegations that Bolton used a private email to send classified national security documents to his wife and daughter before his dismissal by President Trump in September 2019.\n\nThe probe initially began in 2020 and continued into thenPresident Joe Biden\u2018s administration, which subsequently froze the investigation. However, the investigation was reopened by Patel after he assumed the role of FBI director in February.\n\nAlso Read: Ex-Trump Adviser Bolton Says Putin Meeting Brings Back Memories of Taliban Camp David Talks\n\nPresident Trump, speaking to reporters on Friday, stated he had no prior knowledge of the operation. \u201cI know nothing about it,\u201d Trump insisted.\n\n\u201cI just saw it this morning. I tell Attorney General Pam Bondi and I tell the group: \u2018I don't want to know, but you have to do what you have to do. I don't want to know about it,'\u201d Trump said.\n\n\"He's not a smart guy, but he could be a very unpatriotic guy. We're going to find out,\" Trump said of Bolton.\n\nThe investigation is distinct from a separate criminal inquiry into Bolton over his alleged disclosure of national secrets in his 2020 book, \u201cThe Room Where It Happened.\u201d\n\nThe senior US official described the current probe as a \u201cclean break\u201d from the investigation over Bolton\u2019s memoir.\n\nWhy It Matters: The raid on Bolton\u2019s premises marks a significant escalation in the investigation into the former national security adviser\u2019s alleged mishandling of classified information.\n\nThe outcome of this probe could have far-reaching implications for how classified information is handled within the White House, potentially leading to changes in policy and procedure.",

      "text": "- Bolton brands Putin a \"rogue leader of a pariah state,\" casting the meeting as a diplomatic win for Russia.\n- The Trump administration's foreign policy choices back in the spotlight as Bolton's critique hints at internal discord.\n- See the 6X seasonal strategy set to target this fall\u2019s biggest opportunities. Details here \u2192\nJohn Bolton has voiced his criticism over the announcement of a meeting between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, scheduled to take place in Alaska.\nWhat Happened: President Trump\u2019s announcement of the meeting, which was made on the social media platform Truth Social, has drawn attention and criticism, including from Bolton. He expressed his disapproval during a recent interview with CNN.\nThe meeting between President Trump and President Putin is set to occur on Friday, August 15, 2025.\n\u201cThe highly anticipated meeting between myself, as President of the United States of America, and President Vladimir Putin, of Russia, will take place next Friday, August 15, 2025, in the Great State of Alaska,\u201d Trump wrote in the post.\nBolton, who served as President Trump\u2019s national security advisor during his first term, likened the upcoming meeting to Trump\u2019s contentious invitation of the Taliban to Camp David.\nBolton said, \u201cThis is not quite as bad as Trump inviting the Taliban to Camp David to talk about the peace negotiations in Afghanistan, but it certainly reminds one of that.\u201d\nHe further characterized the meeting as a \u201cgreat victory for Putin,\u201d describing the Russian leader as a \u201crogue leader of a pariah state.\u201d\n\u201cThe only better place for Putin than Alaska would be if the summit were being held in Moscow. So, the initial setup, I think, is a great victory for Putin. He's a rogue leader of a pariah state and he's going to be welcomed into the United States,\u201d he further said.\nWhy It Matters: Bolton\u2019s criticism of the announced meeting underscores the ongoing controversy surrounding President Trump\u2019s foreign policy decisions.\nThe comparison to the contentious invitation of the Taliban to Camp David highlights the potential implications of this meeting. Bolton\u2019s comments suggest that the meeting could be perceived as a win for Putin, further complicating the already strained U.S.-Russia relations.\nThe reaction to this meeting, particularly from those within Trump\u2019s own administration, will be a key factor to watch in the lead-up to the scheduled date.\nRead Next\nJim Cramer Has Blunt Message for Fed Chair Powell After July Job Numbers Tanked\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
