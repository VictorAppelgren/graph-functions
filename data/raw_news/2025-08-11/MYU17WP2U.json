  "description": "Former Intel chief executive Craig Barrett has now weighed in on how to save Intel: Get customers to chip in billions to ensure a reliable chip supply.",
  "content": "Is there a way that Intel can be saved? Former Intel chief executive Craig Barrett thinks so, and it isn\u2019t the way the company\u2019s former board members suggest.\n\nIntel should have a number of its customers invest a total of $40 billion in the company to ensure a steady supply of chips, the company\u2019s former chief executive wrote over the weekend.\n\nBarrett\u2019s comments come as current chief executive Lip-Bu Tan is scheduled to meet with President Trump on Monday at the White House, according to a report. However, the meeting doesn\u2019t appear on Trump\u2019s public calendar.\n\nIntel faces numerous crises. On one hand, the company has already announced the layoffs of thousands of employees, dating back to last year. Although Intel solicited billions from the U.S. government as part of the CHIPS Act, it has warned that it might exit chip manufacturing altogether if it can\u2019t find a customer for its 14A manufacturing process. The 14A process follows the 18A process, the foundation of Panther Lake, which Tan has said remains on track. But Trump has also demanded that Tan step down, citing Tan\u2019s ties to a number of Chinese firms in his role as a venture capitalist.\n\nIn the interim, former Intel chief executive Craig Barrett has weighed in with a list of bombastic thoughts on the matter. Barrett, writing in Fortune, is the 86-year-old former CEO who took the reins at Intel in 1998, succeeding the iconic Andy Grove. Barrett oversaw the Pentium III and Pentium 4, as well as the early days of the Xeon processor.\n\nAn investment into the future\n\nIn Barrett\u2019s mind, customers should be investing in Intel to ensure a stable (and American) supply of semiconductors. \u201cNeither Samsung or TSMC plan to bring their state of the art manufacturing to the U.S. in the near term,\u201d he wrote. \u201cU.S. customers like Nvidia, Apple, Google, etc. needs and should understand they NEED a second source for their lead product manufacturing due to pricing, geographic stability and supply line security reasons.\u201d\n\nBarrett suggested that Intel\u2019s customers invest a \u201ccompetitive\u201d $40 billion into the company.\n\n\u201cWhere does the money come from? The customers invest for a piece of Intel and guaranteed supply,\u201d Barrett wrote. \u201cWhy should they invest? Domestic supply, second source, national security, leverage in negotiating with TSMC, etc. AND IF THE USG GETS ITS ACT TOGETHER, they catalyze the action with a 50% (or whatever number Trump picks) tariff on state of the art semi imports. If we can support domestic steel and aluminum, surely we can support domestic semiconductors.\u201d (Emphasis Barrett\u2019s.)\n\nFortune, which has apparently dug into its contact list to solicit advice on the Intel matter, previously published an opinion written by former board members arguing that Tan should be fired and the company broken up. \u201cBe serious,\u201d Barrett wrote.\n\n\u201cBy all means, if you want to complicate the problem, then take the time to split up Intel and make the FFWBMs [the \u201cfour former wise board members\u201d] happy but if you\u2019re in the business of saving Intel and its core manufacturing strength for the USA then solve the real problem \u2014 immediate investment in Intel, committed customers, national security, etc.",

      "text": "Intel is a company in crisis, failing to compete with the products of its booming rivals and struggling to get back on its feet after a high-profile leadership shakeup and devastating layoffs. The last thing it needs is to be in the crosshairs of an increasingly retaliatory federal government. But that is indeed what\u2019s happening, as U.S. president Trump demands that Intel\u2019s new CEO Lip-Bu Tan resign.\n\u201cThe CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately. There is no other solution to this problem,\u201d Trump posted to Truth Social, a private social network owned and controlled by the president of the United States.\nTrump offered up no specifics and no evidence to support the claim. As TechCrunch notes, the early-morning post follows less than two days after senator Tom Cotton, a Trump ally from Arkansas, wrote a letter to Intel\u2019s board questioning Tan\u2019s investments in Chinese businesses. Of particular contention is Tan\u2019s former leadership of Cadence Design Systems, which was fined $140 million for violating export restrictions to China. Reuters raised concerns over Tam\u2019s Chinese investments in April, a month after he accepted the position following Pat Gelsinger\u2019s retirement last year.\nOne of the biggest cornerstones of Trump\u2019s second term is isolationism and spurring investment in United States manufacturing, particularly in the lucrative and visible chip fabrication sector. Intel is a major beneficiary of the CHIPS Act passed during former president Biden\u2019s term, and is currently constructing massive new semiconductor factories in Ohio, in addition to its primary facilities in Oregon and secondary plants in Arizona and New Mexico.\nIntel roiled markets in July by raising the possibility that it could exit chip manufacturing entirely if it could not find customers for its 14A manufacturing process, scheduled to debut two generations hence in 2028 or 2029. But Intel\u2019s inability to find big-name customers for its nascent foundry operations, period, has begun worrying former Intel board members that the entire strategy needs to be rethought. Writing in Forbes (via PCGamer), they proposed \u201cOperation Warp Speed II\u201d: a program to buy back Intel\u2019s fabs through a public-private partnership and then \u201cencourage\u201d U.S. companies to buy from it.\nTrump yesterday announced plans to raise import tariffs on semiconductors, essential components in basically all electronics, to 100 percent. He implied that he would waive the restrictions for companies that are \u201cbuilding in the United States,\u201d which would presumably include Intel. Intel\u2019s new Ohio fabrication plants are scheduled to come online in 2030 and 2031.\nThe Trump administration has established a pattern of attempting control over major American corporations. The Paramount/CBS merger with Skydance Media, a deal years in the making, was only approved by the FCC after Paramount paid a $16 million lawsuit settlement to Donald Trump following a 60 Minutes interview with his campaign opponent Kamala Harris. CBS subsequently cancelled The Late Show, the best-performing TV show in its aging niche, after host Stephen Colbert was critical of the president.\nEarlier this week, Apple CEO Tim Cook presented Trump with a golden plaque after announcing an additional $100 billion in investments in American manufacturing. Intel rival Nvidia has announced $500 billion in U.S. manufacturing on soaring profits during the AI boom. Restrictions on exports to China specifically for Nvidia\u2019s AI chips were eased following Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s attendance at a $1 million-a-seat dinner at Trump\u2019s private residence in Florida.\nIt certainly appears that there can be business rewards for indulging Trump, and steep regulatory hurdles for refusing to do so. Exactly how Intel might be rewarded or punished has yet to be seen.\nThis story was updated at 10:10 AM to add more details by Mark Hachman."

      "text": "Four former Intel board members are backing President Donald Trump\u2019s surprise attack on the company\u2019s CEO, but they are pushing for a shake-up that is both more dramatic and wholly in line with their vocal criticism of late.\nIn a rare collective statement provided exclusively to Fortune, the former directors said the fate of CEO Lip-Bu Tan should be decided by Intel shareholders and its board, but called for a radical restructuring that would spin off Intel\u2019s manufacturing arm into an independent company to secure America\u2019s chipmaking dominance.\nThe group of former Intel board members\u2014Charlene Barshefsky, Reed Hundt, James Plummer, and David Yoffie\u2014pointed out that the company is on its fourth CEO in seven years with little improvement in results. They argued that only a dramatic break could restore Intel\u2019s competitiveness and protect U.S. national security interests, with a rescue plan focused specifically on emancipating Intel\u2019s \u201cFoundry\u201d business, the manufacturing assets in which Intel produces semiconductor chips for its own products and for third-party customers. These advanced chip fabrication facilities are increasingly top of mind for President Donald Trump, his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, and the entire tech industry, watching as the drama unfolds.\nIntel was long the leader in chips but has fallen behind Nvidia, TSMC, and other players in recent years, as Barshefsky, Hundt, Plummer, and Yoffie argued in the pages of Fortune. Intel has two main businesses, one being the Foundry and the other, called simply Intel Products, which includes its flagship PC and server microprocessors, as well as networking equipment and software. Both are essential for computing, but only the Foundry is key to national security, which has been a key point in trade talks between Trump and Xi. The group of former directors argued that splitting the chips manufacturing entity from the rest of Intel would directly address both market competitiveness and the nation\u2019s strategic need for advanced semiconductors.\nThe group called for Intel shareholders to insist on the split, which would create a new, independent manufacturing entity, with its own CEO and board. To make the new company competitive with TSMC, the former directors called for remaining funds under the CHIPS Act to go toward supporting the company and to help \u201cpersuade American design firms to place orders.\u201d That would position the new company as an alternative to TSMC, \u201cboth for cutting-edge chips needed for data-center and other commercial purposes and for national security requirements.\u201d\nMounting pressure\nThe statement comes as pressure on Intel intensifies, after President Donald Trump publicly called for CEO Lip-Bu Tan\u2019s resignation over his \u201cconflicted\u201d status and alleged ties to Chinese technology firms. Trump\u2019s demand, posted on Truth Social Thursday morning, sent shock waves through U.S. tech circles and drew swift responses from the company.\nTan responded in a letter to staff, posted publicly on Intel\u2019s website, claiming there has been \u201cmisinformation\u201d about his career and past leadership roles. The embattled CEO said that Intel is \u201cengaging\u201d with the Trump White House to \u201caddress the matters that have been raised and ensure they have the facts.\u201d He added that he fully shares the president\u2019s commitment to advancing U.S. national and economic security.\nPresident Trump\u2019s intervention followed Sen. Tom Cotton\u2019s warnings over reports of Tan\u2019s prior investments in Chinese firms, some allegedly tied to China\u2019s military. Trump\u2019s demand for an immediate CEO change provoked a 3% drop in Intel\u2019s stock Thursday, compounding board-level discord and market concerns about the company\u2019s stagnation and loss of ground to rivals such as Nvidia and AMD.\nIn his note to staff on Thursday, Tan defended his integrity and claimed the current board was \u201cfully supportive\u201d of the work currently underway at Intel, while insisting that throughout his four decades in the industry, he has \u201calways operated within the highest legal and ethical standards.\u201d\nIntel did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nIn a previous statement to Fortune, however, the company pushed back on criticism, saying its board and CEO are \u201cdeeply committed to advancing U.S. national and economic security interests\u201d and were making \u201csignificant investments aligned with the President\u2019s America First agenda.\u201d\nIntel noted it has been manufacturing in the U.S. for 56 years and is investing billions of dollars in domestic semiconductor R&D and manufacturing, including a new Arizona fab that will run the most advanced process technology in the country. The company added that it was \u201cthe only company investing in leading logic process node development in the U.S.\u201d and said it looked forward to \u201ccontinued engagement with the Administration.\u201d\nCorrection, Aug. 8, 2025: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that the four former directors called for the ouster of Intel\u2019s CEO. The group of former directors said that Intel shareholders should make the decision about the CEO."

In recent years, the company has become the top supplier of chips used in data centers for the data-intensive job of training and running AI models. Nvidia is also a big seller of graphics chips for video game consoles and high-end personal computers, and chips used by the automotive industry in new cars. Nvidia was incorporated in 1993.\nNvidia\nNvidia in Fortune Rankings\n- About\n- Great Place to Work\n- Earnings Reports\nEmployees say:\n\"Our CEO demonstrates that he cares about employees by pushing back or avoiding layoffs as much as possible. Another example is that he has insisted that employees should decide how to balance work and life, and has resisted to forcing people to show up to the office and that employees should determine when they need to be in the office to achieve their work.\"\nWith 16,568 U.S. employees, Nvidia is igniting a culture of growth by providing staffers with the NVLearn training platform and AI-focused Deep Learning Institute. Nvidia also has a strong charitable Inspire 365 initiative for giving back.\nEmployees say: \"The collaboration and closeness to any department is incredible. It feels like a startup with massive funding. The transparency top-down is amazing. I love the clear communication and direction at every company meeting, especially with our CEO.\"\nEmployees say:\n\"In my job at Nvidia, I get to work with multiple teams all at once. It is nice because I get to learn many things and get to experience working with many people across different teams. We have very great donation matching program which is unlike other companies I've worked for. I feel like even when I work a lot, I can make a difference and contribute to causes I care about. Nvidia is also about life-long learning so there are many programs for completing higher education degree.\"\nNvidia ranks No. 25 on the 2024 World\u2019s 25 Best Workplaces list.\nEmployees say:\n\"The honesty, transparency, integrity, and respect I have experienced at this company are unparallelled. From the moment I joined, I felt welcomed and part of the mission and importantly, I clearly understood what the mission was because the CEO expressly addressed the entire company to explain in a direct, inspiring, and motivational company meeting. There are unlimited resources for continued learning and growth and taking time for these learning opportunities is encouraged. I truly feel a part of this company - comfortable, connected, stimulated, and motivated. I am confident I am in the right place.\"\nEmployees say:\n\"The CEO and management team have an excellent vision and mission, and information sharing is highly transparent. Employees are empowered and inspired to work wholeheartedly. The spirit of teamwork here is exceptional.\"\nEmployees say:\n\"Regardless of how big NVIDIA is, we are treated as if we are on a small team and cared for immensely. NVIDIA changes the standard of 'a great place to work', truly.\"\nEmployees say:\n\"Amazing leadership and vison by our CEO\u2014he sees the trends before they happen. Makes you proud when telling people you work for Nvidia. Immediate management lets you do your job without looking over your shoulder.\"\nEven as the broader tech sector has shed tens of thousands of jobs, Nvidia continued its remarkable streak of nearly 15 years without any layoffs. As revenue almost doubled in 2023, the computing company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., also cut travel and trimmed expenses across the board and managed to guarantee annual pay raises. Nvidia prides itself on its \u201cflat structure,\u201d where employees are encouraged to solve problems quickly and collaboratively through projects, thus dispensing with the unnecessary strictures of job descriptions, reporting lines, or specific roles; there are never more than seven layers of management between junior employees and CEO Jensen Huang. Staff are also given a voice through triannual \u201cpulse\u201d surveys to gauge employee sentiment on topics ranging from diversity and inclusion policies to pursuing meaningful work. And as Nvidia has emerged as a key player in the AI boom, it\u2019s committed to advancing trustworthy AI that reflects responsible and ethical social values.\nEven though Nvidia employs more than 26,000 people worldwide, it prides itself in having no more than seven layers between the most junior worker and the CEO. To ensure new employees fit right in, Nvidia matches potential hires with current employees through Insider Interviews, which allows candidates to have informal conversations with future colleagues to learn more about company culture. Nvidia has implemented a new global allyship program and Inclusive Manager Playbook and increased the number of staff focused on recruiting diverse talent in an effort to create a more inclusive workplace. Last year, Nvidia addressed burnout with quarterly \u201cfree days,\u201d where the entire company unplugs for two consecutive days each quarter so that everyone can rest and recharge.\nEmployees say:\n\"We boast an exceptional CEO who has demonstrated unparalleled leadership during a period when numerous tech companies resorted to downsizing in response to declining stock prices. In stark contrast, our CEO steadfastly supported our workforce, diligently attending to the well-being and needs of each and every employee.\"\nEmployees say:\n\"At Nvidia, it's all about the people. This company cares greatly for the people who work here and their families, the parental leave for new fathers is one-of-a-kind, support for COVID-19 has been amazing, whenever there is a weather event, earthquake, wildfire, or political unrest anywhere around the world, Nvidia reaches out to each and every affected employee to make sure that they and their families are safe and have any resources that they may need. It's phenomenal how much Nvidia cares for it's employees and their families.\"\nEmployees say:\n\"The company really makes effort to look after its employees. During the financial hard time, other companies in the same industry laid off people, but our CEO openly said no layoffs. Also the company gave us raise in salary and ahead of its usual schedule. We can freely choose to work from home and office and we are empowered to make the best choice for ourselves.\"\nEmployees say:\n\"As a relatively junior employee, I feel empowered and trusted by my colleagues and leadership. My ideas are not only respected, but often encouraged and pursued. I have a lot of flexibility in managing my own time and priorities. I get to work with insanely smart people who seem to have infinite patience for helping me, teaching me, and mentoring me.\"\n- Company Information\n- Change The World\n- Best Workplaces In Technology\n- Best Workplaces For Women\n- Fastest-growing Companies\n- World's Best Workplaces\n- Future 50\n- Best Workplaces For Parents\n- World's Most Admired Companies\n- America's Most Innovative Companies\n- Best Companies\n- Benefits\n- Key Financials (last Fiscal Year)\n- Profit Ratios\n- Earnings Per Share (last Fiscal Year)\n- Total Return\n- Best Workplaces In The Bay Area"

However, Intel plans to end 2025 with just 75,000 employees as it continues reducing its workforce.\nIntel chief executive Lip-Bu Tan also characterized Intel\u2019s move away from hyperthreading, begun with its \u201cArrow Lake\u201d chip, as a mistake.\nAs Intel reported earnings for the second quarter of 2025, the company\u2019s message was that it continues to execute on a strategy to focus on customers and engineering. As part of that, Intel recorded $1.9 billion in restructuring charges, mostly to do with reorganizing manufacturing and assembly operations.\n\u201cI know the past few months have not been easy,\u201d Intel chief executive Lip-Bu Tan wrote in a memo to employees. \u201cWe are making hard but necessary decisions to streamline the organization, drive greater efficiency and increase accountability at every level of the company.\u201d\nTan\u2019s goals are to \u201cright-size\u201d the company\u2019s workforce and hold them to account, by both trimming headcount and thinning the ranks of middle management. Tan also said that the company is slowing the development of its Ohio chip fab \u2014 which was funded in part by the CHIPS Act, signed during the Biden administration. Intel plans to consolidate its assembly and test operations in Costa Rica to larger sites in Vietnam and Malaysia, and not go forward with \u201cprojects\u201d in Poland and Germany. Intel was rumored to possibly shutter operations in Israel, but that hasn\u2019t happened. Tan called Intel\u2019s factory strategy \u201cneedlessly fragmented\u201d in a conference call with analysts.\nIntel\u2019s chip roadmap is on track\u2026\nTan, however, seems to be completely behind Intel\u2019s existing product roadmap, which is centered on Intel\u2019s next-generation Panther Lake chip and the supporting 18A process. He called the 18A process (and a related 18A-P process) \u201cthe foundation of at least the next three generations of Intel client and server products,\u201d Tan said, delivering meaningful wafer volumes into the next decade.\n\u201cWe actually won\u2019t get to peak volumes on 18A until probably the beginning of the next decade,\u201d Intel chief financial officer David Zinsner said on the call. \u201cSo this is going to be a node that we use for a very long time, and we\u2019re expecting a really good ROI [return on investment] on it.\u201d\nIntel\nThat\u2019s a marked shift from past years. Intel just completed a breakneck process of establishing five process nodes in four years, part of former Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger\u2019s strategy of regaining a manufacturing leadership after years of being unable to move past the 14nm process node. Intel\u2019s 18A process was supposed to be the end of that road, though Intel recently began talking about an \u201c18A-P\u201d process technology, which would include Intel\u2019s RibbonFET and PowerVia technologies.\nFor now, customers continue to buy older chips like Raptor Lake, and demand for the Intel 7 process technology upon which they are built remains tight, Zinsner said. \u201cI think, you know, the price points of Raptor Lake are, I think, where a lot of consumers and enterprises are buying PCs,\u201d Zinsner said.\nWall Street analysts appeared doubtful, with one even asking whether the manufacturing node beyond 18A, known as 14A, would be too late \u2014 or, to put it another way, whether Intel was indirectly saying that it would exit the foundry business entirely.\nBut future products seem a little doubtful\nTan responded by saying that the 14A design team is \u201claser focused\u201d on ensuring the basic building blocks of the technology. But it sounds like Tan might be leaving Intel\u2019s options open. \u201cThe 14A is a process node, but clearly I will make sure that, you know, I see the internal customer, external customer volume commitment, before I put cap[ital] back into the operation.\u201d\nIntel said in a filing, however, that if it could not secure manufacturing customers for the 14A process, Intel could even leave chip manufacturing entirely. That decision will probably wait for some time, however. Tan said later that the 14A process should debut in 2028 or 2029.\nSoon, however, Intel expects customers to transition to the newer chips.\nAdam Patrick Murray / Foundry\n\u201cPanther Lake is our top priority as it will reinforce our strength in notebooks across consumer and enterprise,\u201d Tan told employees. \u201cWe also must drive continued progress on Nova Lake to close gaps in the high-end desktop space.\u201d\nThe first Panther Lake processor remains on track to begin shipping later this year, with additional products coming in the first half of 2026, Intel said.\nTan said that he will sign off on every new major product before it tapes out. Tan also said in an analyst call that he was not a believer in \u201cif you build it, they will come.\u201d Instead, Intel will build what customers want, when they need it, he said. Tan said he is also in favor of \u201ccleaner,\u201d more efficient designs.\nInterestingly, Tan also criticized Intel\u2019s decision to eliminate hyperthreading, also known as simultaneous hyperthreading (SMT). Though he addressed this as an issue in the data center, it will be interesting to see whether Intel makes a similar decision to return hyperthreading to its desktop and client chips, as well.\n\u201cMoving away from SMT put us at a competitive disadvantage,\u201d Tan said. \u201cBringing it back will help us close performance gaps.\u201d\nFinally, Intel will move away from a strictly silicon-based approach to AI. \u201cWe will focus our AI efforts on developing a cohesive silicon, system, and software stack strategy,\u201d Tan said.\n\u201cWe have a lot to fix to move the company forward, Tan said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m determined to drive the changes necessary to improve our performance.\u201d\nIntel lost $2.9 billion for the second quarter, under the GAAP method, recording flat revenue of $12.9 billion. Intel\u2019s outlook, however, was better than expected: $12.6 billion to $13.6 billion, which was more than what Wall Street expected. Intel\u2019s Client Computing Group revenues fell 3 percent versus the same quarter in 2024, down to $7.9 billion.\nThis story was updated at 12:39 PM on July 25 with additional details."

      "text": "Intel said Thursday that the company will lay off more than 15 percent of its workforce, layoffs that were forced upon it by unused manufacturing capacity and charges associated with the launch of its AI PCs.\nIntel positioned it as part of the \u201cnext phase of its multiyear transformation strategy,\u201d but the cuts are fairly severe. Intel intends to reduce R&D and marketing, and general spending to $20 billion in 2024, $17.5 billion in 2025, and even lower in 2026. Intel will cut roughly 15,000 of its 131,000-employee headcount, most by the end of the year.\n\u201cOur Q2 financial performance was disappointing, even as we hit key product and process technology milestones,\u201d Pat Gelsinger, Intel\u2019s chief executive, said in a statement. \u201cSecond-half trends are more challenging than we previously expected, and we are leveraging our new operating model to take decisive actions that will improve operating and capital efficiencies while accelerating our IDM 2.0 transformation.\u201d\nIntel said that it\u2019s nearing the completion of its plan to push through five manufacturing nodes in four years, and is therefore moving to a focus toward capital efficiency. That means that Intel will spend less on manufacturing than it expected: down 20 percent in gross capital expenditures in 2024. Right now, the company\u2019s product roadmap appears unchanged, but company executives will provide more detail in a conference call Thursday afternoon.\nIn a memo to employees, Gelsinger said that the news was \u201cpainful\u201d for him to share. Intel will hold a company-wide conference call following its earnings call on Thursday afternoon, where Gelsinger will talk specifics.\n\u201cThis is the most significant rebuilding at Intel since the transition from memory to microprocessors,\u201d Gelsinger told analysts in a conference call.\nProducts will be reviewed, but remain unchanged for now\nIntel\u2019s roadmap remains in place. But it sounds like changes could be coming.\nOne of the company\u2019s goals, Gelsinger said, is to eliminate complexity and specifically simplify the company\u2019s product portfolio. \u201cWe will complete actions this month to simplify our businesses,\u201d Gelsinger wrote in his memo to employees. \u201cEach business unit is conducting a portfolio review and identifying underperforming products. We are also integrating key software assets into our business units so we accelerate our shift to systems-based solutions. And we will narrow our incubation focus on fewer, more impactful projects.\u201d\nIntel\nIntel has recently suffered through issues associated with its 13th-gen Core chips, which it recently attributed to voltage problems. Intel plans to launch its next-gen Core Ultra chip, Lunar Lake, at the IFA show at the beginning of September. Gelsinger said that Lunar Lake is actually ahead of schedule, he said. David Zinsner, Intel\u2019s chief financial officer, added that Lunar Lake would be \u201cramping\u201d next year, in 2025, however.\nIntel has shipped more than 15 million Core Ultra chips to date, Gelsinger said. The industry has shipped 40 million AI PCs to date and 100 million by the end of the year, he said. Arrow Lake, Intel\u2019s next chip, will add AI to the desktop, Gelsinger said. (Intel has not said if Arrow Lake will be branded as a Core Ultra chip.)\nPanther Lake, Intel\u2019s next mobile chip, will ship in the second half of 2025, as Intel shifts to its 18A process. \u201cWe are well on our way toward 14A and 10A development,\u201d Gelsinger said, though Intel will be moving toward a less aggressive process roadmap.\nWhile Intel\u2019s Lunar Lake was essentially made at TSMC, Panther Lake will \u201cbe internally sourced at 18A,\u201d David Zinsner, Intel\u2019s chief financial officer said, helping its profitability. Intel executives that turning to outside foundries was necessary to enable its aggressive plan to move through five production nodes in four years. In 2026, that production will move back inside Intel, he said.\nInterestingly, Intel took $1 billion in charges by moving Intel 4 and Intel 3 wafers from its development fab in Oregon to its production fab in Ireland, with higher costs. But that decision may pay off with an accelerated schedule in the future, executives said.\nGelsinger said that Intel will incrementally build its business over the course of 2024. Normally, the fourth quarter is the high point of the year. Gelsinger said that fourth-quarter revenues should be about 5 percent higher than the same quarter last year, lower than anticipated.\nUpdated at 2:55 PM with additional details."

  "argos_summary": "Former Intel CEO Craig Barrett suggests that Intel should secure $40 billion in investments from its customers to stabilize its chip supply amid ongoing crises, including layoffs and potential exit from chip manufacturing. Barrett argues that U.S. companies like Nvidia and Apple need a reliable second source for semiconductor manufacturing, especially as tensions with the Trump administration grow over CEO Lip-Bu Tan's ties to Chinese firms. Meanwhile, four former Intel board members advocate for a radical restructuring of the company to enhance competitiveness and national security by spinning off its manufacturing arm.",
