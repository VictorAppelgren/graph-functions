  "content": "A 325 foot Douglas-fir (not pictured) in Coquille, Oregon, is on fire.\n\nIn coastal Oregon, the state's tallest fir tree is burning.\n\nDouglas-firs (Pseudotsuga menziesii) are Oregon's most common trees, but the tree that's ablaze, known as the Doerner Fir, is special. Measuring 325 feet (99.1 meters) tall and with a diameter of 11.5 feet (3.5 m), it is one of the world's biggest coastal Douglas-fir trees, and one of the largest trees on Earth.\n\nIt is thought to be at least 450 years old, and it grows east of Coquille, Oregon, in a forest under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM).\n\nOregon's Coos Forest Protective Association (Coos FPA) reported the fire on Sunday (Aug. 17) in . The fire began on Aug. 16 and the Doerner Fir has been burning ever since. According to the Coos FPA, flames were detected at the top of the tree and extended down its trunk. The Doerner Fir was the only tree affected by the blaze.\n\nFirefighters with the Coos FPA worked to control the fire, building a containment line around the base of the tree; dampening the trunk from below to keep the fire from spreading; and using helicopters to douse the top of the tree with buckets of water.\n\nDrones deployed by the BLM captured images of the treetop to help firefighters plan how to extinguish the fire and save the tree, according to a Coos FPA update on Facebook.\n\nRelated: The oldest tree in the world (and the 7 runner-ups)\n\nOn Tuesday evening (Aug. 19), flames were no longer directly visible. However, infrared drone images showed a hot spot inside the trunk where fire still burned, at a height of approximately 250 feet (76 m) from the ground.\n\nWeather this week is expected to become hotter and drier, and firefighters are on alert to make sure the fire does not spread to the surrounding trees, the Coos FPA reported.\n\nSo far, about 50 feet (15 m) from the top of the historic fir have been lost to the fire, BLM spokesperson Megan Harper told (AP). Though diminished from its former record-breaking height, the tree will likely survive the fire, Harper added.\n\n\"The tree is so big, it's got so much mass that it would take a while for it to burn all the way through the tree,\" Harper told the AP.\n\nBLM representatives ruled out a lightning strike as the cause of the fire, based on a review of recent weather data. Officials are continuing to investigate how the fire started, according to the Coos FPA.",

The Dragon Bravo Fire has burned down the Grand Canyon Lodge and triggered a chlorine gas leak.\nA wildfire has ignited the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, burning down the Grand Canyon Lodge and other historic cabins.\nFirefighters were managing the Dragon Bravo Fire, started by a lightning strike, when an uncommonly strong gust of wind pushed the fire beyond multiple containment features on Friday (July 11), according to InciWeb, the U.S. government's incident information management system website.\nThe fire then exhibited \"extreme and volatile\" behavior on Saturday (July 12), expanding by 500 acres (0.8 square miles) according to a statement released by the National Park Service (NPS). Conditions in the region are hot, dry and windy, making it more challenging for firefighters.\nA second wildfire, named the White Sage Fire, is burning around 35 miles (56 kilometers) north of the Dragon Bravo Fire in Kaibab National Forest.\n\"Preliminary assessments indicate that between 50 to 80 structures have been lost, including NPS administrative buildings and visitor facilities,\" NPS representatives wrote in the statement. \"No injuries or loss of life have been reported, and all staff and residents were successfully evacuated prior to the fire\u2019s escalation.\"\nRelated: 'We are creating the fire equivalent of an ice age': Humans have plunged Earth into the 'Pyrocene'\nMost wildfires are started by humans, either accidentally or on purpose, but lightning is a common natural cause, responsible for around 10% of global forest fires.

      "text": "Watch mesmerizing 1,000-foot-tall lava fountains: Kilauea volcano erupting in ways not seen for 40 years\nThe USGS has announced that Kilauea volcano is ejecting fountains of lava in a manner not seen since the Pu'u'\u014d'\u014d eruption in the 1980s. But while the lava is mesmerizing, officials warn that the volcano is also producing toxic gases and other hazards.\nHawaii's Kilauea volcano has been erupting with gigantic fountains of lava, the likes of which haven't been seen in around 40 years.\nOn Sunday (May 25), some of these lava fountains shot up more than 1,000 feet (300 meters) into the sky. Scientists estimated that while this was going on, the volcano was also emitting up to around 83,000 tons (75,000 metric tons) of toxic sulphur dioxide per day, according to an update on the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) website.\nThe ongoing eruption in the Halema'uma'u crater has been on pause since the dramatic scenes on Sunday, though magma remains close to the surface and the volcano continues to emit sulfur dioxide. The latest fountain activity marked the 23rd episode of Halema'uma'u crater's eruption cycle that began on Dec. 23, 2024.\nKilauea has been producing fountains of lava in waves that last anywhere from a few hours to over a week since the start of this eruption. In a volcano update on Tuesday (May 27), USGS representatives compared the ongoing activity to that of the historical Pu'u'\u014d'\u014d eruption on the eastern rift zone of Kilauea. The Pu'u'\u014d'\u014d eruption began in 1983 and didn't stop until 2018, but the early years were marked by high lava fountains, similar to those currently produced in the Halema'uma'u crater.\n\"The current eruption has been characterized by episodic fountaining not seen in any eruptions since the 1983-86 episodic fountains at the beginning of the Pu'u'\u014d'\u014d eruption,\" USGS representatives wrote.\nKilauea volcano is one of the world's most active volcanoes and has erupted almost continuously on Hawaii's Big Island for more than 30 years. The volcano makes up about 14% of the island's land area and rises 4,190 feet (1,227 m) above sea level. Halema'uma'u crater is at the summit of the volcano and is said to be the home of Pele, the Hawaiian goddess of fire and volcanoes.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nThe Halema'uma'u eruption is taking place in a closed part of Hawaii's Volcanoes National Park. However, while the eruption itself is confined to the park, the gases it emits can travel beyond the park's limits.\n\"High levels of volcanic gas\u2014primarily water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2)\u2014are the primary hazard of concern, as this hazard can have far-reaching effects downwind,\" USGS representatives wrote.\nThe sulfur dioxide released from the volcano can mix with other gases and particles in the atmosphere to create a haze called volcanic smog (vog). Inhaling vog at high concentrations may cause respiratory problems and other health issues such as eye and skin irritation, according to USGS.\nThere are a variety of other hazards associated with the ongoing volcanic activity, including strands of windblown volcanic glass. These hair-like strands, named Pele's hair after the Hawaiian goddess, form when gas bubbles within lava burst at the surface, and their skin stretches into long threads. These strands are currently spread across the Kilauea summit. The extent to which they move depends on lava fountaining and wind conditions, but the USGS warned that they pose a threat to human health.\n\"Residents and visitors should minimize exposure to Pele's hair and other volcanic fragments, which can cause skin and eye irritation,\" USGS representatives wrote.\nUSGS offers views of the Kilauea summit through live webcams.

      "text": "When did Earth's first forests emerge?\nTrees have a birthday, just like any other type of organism.\nFrom Earth's tallest living plants, California's redwoods, to the planet's largest tropical rainforest, the Amazon, stately forests may seem timeless. But like every species or ecosystem, they have a birth date. In fact, though plants first arrived on land about 470 million years ago, trees and forests didn't hit the scene until nearly 390 million years ago.\nDuring that interval, plant life slowly evolved genetic precursors needed to produce trees, which then outcompeted other plants, Chris Berry, a paleobotanist at Cardiff University in the United Kingdom, told Live Science.\nIn 2019, Berry and colleagues reported on the oldest forest on record, in the journal Current Biology. This forest, uncovered in Cairo, New York, revealed that features characteristic of trees and forests \u2014 namely wood, roots and leaves amid a population of dozens of plants \u2014 appeared \"far earlier than previously suspected\": in the early Devonian period, 385 million years ago, the researchers said in the study.\nRelated: Do trees exist (scientifically speaking)?\nThe Cairo site preserved fossilized root systems of ancient trees, pinpointing where they would have appeared in life, Berry said. \"We don't see fossils of the trees, but we see a map of exactly where those trees were standing,\" he said. \"So what we learn is the ecology of the forest.\"\nThat fossilized \"map\" features Archaeopteris, an ancient plant that boasted \"large woody roots and woody branches with leaves,\" like modern trees, according to a report from Binghamton University in New York. Previously, the earliest known Archaeopteris find had placed the plants' arrival 20 million years later, Science reported.\nThe development of these early forests depended on the evolution of precursors to defining tree traits, Berry said. \"I think the trigger is evolutionary, the development of anatomies which allow more complex branching,\" he said. Such anatomies arrived once plants had evolved \"the genetic toolkit to be able to build\" tree-like structures, Berry said. Early branching systems, for example, developed just before the Devonian, in the Silurian period (443.8 million to 419.2 million years ago), while the first roots arrived in the early Devonian, according to two reports from the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Tree traits thereafter conferred major advantages, particularly the ability to rise above competition to soak up sunlight.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nSome environmental changes may have made at least one important tree feature possible, however. Megaphylls, leaves that are common today and are characterized by branching veins, can grow much larger than their predecessors, thus absorbing more sunlight. They first appeared about 390 million years ago but started out small and became widespread only 30 million years later, at the end of the Devonian, according to a 2001 study in the journal Nature and a 2021 PBS \"Eons\" episode featuring the study.\nThat delay occurred because high carbon dioxide (CO2) levels made Earth too hot for large, megaphyll leaves, the study found. They'd simply absorb too much sunlight and overheat. Plummeting CO2 levels in the Devonian, however, doubly benefited megaphylls: Reductions in this greenhouse gas cooled the planet, while large megaphylls could fit in more pores called stomata to take in higher levels of dwindling CO2. Such leaves could then help push forward the forest revolution.\nOriginally published on Live Science.\nMichael Dhar is a science editor and writer based in Chicago.

      "text": "Trees are some of the most majestic and awe-inspiring living things on the planet. And many of them are really, really big.\nBut which one is the tallest?\nIt turns out that the tallest trees on Earth are the coast redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) that loom over the mist-shrouded coastline of Redwood National Park, in Northern California. And the king of these giants is a tree known as Hyperion, according to Guinness World Records. When it was last measured in 2019, it stood an eye-popping 380 feet, 9.7 inches (116.07 meters) tall from top to base, taller than a 35-story building.\nHyperion's exact location is a closely held secret, but it is apparently rooted in a hillside in which most of the old-growth coastal redwoods have been logged. Somehow, Hyperion has escaped the chainsaw, and the tree is estimated to be between 600 and 800 years old.\nRelated: Do trees exist (scientifically speaking)?\nThe living skyscraper was first discovered in 2006, by Chris Atkins and Michael Taylor, part of a team of researchers who, at the time, tramped through the California forests hunting for the tallest trees, SFGate reported. At that time, the tree was a tiny bit shorter, at 379 feet, 1.2 in (115.5 m). Around the same time, that group discovered the second and third-tallest trees: Helios, which was then 376.3 feet (114.7 m) tall, and Icarus, which stood 371.2 feet (113.1 m) tall.\n\"Even though they're on steep slopes, they're growing in the finest redwood habitat on the planet,\" Atkins told SFGate in 2006. \"They're right below a ridge, so they're protected from the wind. They're near abundant water, and they have plenty of fog, which keeps the local microclimate mild and moist. And they have great sun exposure.\"\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nCoast redwoods are not only the tallest trees on the planet, they are also some of the oldest living things on Earth; they can live up to 2,000 years. It's not clear exactly why these trees can live to be so ancient, but the climate plays a role. Even when inland California burns in the summer, a blanket of thick fog enshrouds the coastal groves, keeping the temperature cool year-round. The coast also sees about 100 inches (254 centimeters) of rainfall a year, which also helps nurture these groves of giants, according to the National Park Service.\nCoast redwoods are also some of the most resilient trees on Earth. Their tannin-rich bark seems to be nearly impervious to the fungus and disease that fells other trees, according to the NPS. And the 12-inch-thick (25 cm) bark of these silent giants enables them to withstand the wildfires that have historically swept through the Sierras.\nWhile coast redwoods are the tallest trees on Earth, they are not the largest. The largest trees on the planet are General Sherman and General Grant, giant sequoias that cling to the rocky, fire-scarred Sierras in California's Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks.\nAnd North America doesn't have a monopoly on uber-tall trees. The tallest trees on other continents, according to Guinness World Records, are:\n- A Eucalyptus regnans found on the island of Tasmania, which stands 327.5 feet (99.82 m) tall, is Australia's tallest tree.\n- Asia's tallest tree is a yellow meranti tree (Shorea faguetiana) found in Malaysia. It is just a touch shorter than Australia's tallest tree, at 323.3 feet (98.53 m) tall.\n- In South America, a red angelim (Dinizia excelsea) tree in Brazil's Amazon rainforest is the tallest on the continent, at 290.4 feet (88.5 m)\n- Africa's tallest tree, a myovo tree (Entandrophragma excelsum) near Kilimanjaro National Park in Tanzania stands 267.4 feet (81.50m) tall\n- Europe's largest tree lives in Portugal. This Karri tree (Eucalyptus diversicolor) stands 239.2 feet (72.9 m) tall.\nOriginally published on Live Science.\nTia is the managing editor and was previously a senior writer for Live Science.

(AP) \u2014 Authorities in Oregon are trying to extinguish a fire that is burning in one of the world\u2019s tallest trees near the state\u2019s southern coast.\nThe Doerner Fir, a coastal Douglas Fir tree over 325 feet (99 meters) tall and estimated to be over 450 years old, has been burning since Saturday in Coos County in Oregon\u2019s Coast Range. An infrared drone flight on Tuesday showed no active flames or smoke at the top of the tree, but it detected heat within a cavity in the tree trunk some 280 feet high, federal Bureau of Land Management spokesperson Megan Harper said.\nFiguring out how to approach the tree from the side to douse the cavity with water has been a challenge, Harper said. Various options have been discussed, including building scaffolding or climbing adjacent trees for better positioning, or letting it smolder and monitoring to see if it reignites.\nCrews remained on-site Tuesday and a helicopter was on standby in case of needed water drops, she added.\nThe Coos Forest Protective Association said Monday that helicopter bucket drops had reduced fire activity near the top of the tree. It added that sprinklers were placed at the base of the tree, where containment lines were also constructed to prevent further fire spread.\nThe fire may impact the tree\u2019s standing in global height rankings, Harper said.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lost about 50 feet of it, just from fire and pieces falling out,\u201d she said, noting that the 50 feet (15 meters) were lost through the top burning. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know where it\u2019ll stand after this, but it\u2019s still a magnificent tree.\u201d\nInvestigators with the Bureau of Land Management have ruled out lightning as a cause of the fire based on weather data, the federal agency said Tuesday evening. It is the only tree on fire in the immediate vicinity, and the cause of the fire is still under investigation.\nFor now, the tree is not at risk of fully burning down, according to Harper.\n\u201cRight now, that is not a danger,\u201d she said. \u201cThe tree is so big, it\u2019s got so much mass that it would take a while for it to burn all the way through the tree.\u201d\nMeanwhile, those involved in the firefighting efforts want to do everything possible to save the historic tree, Harper said.\n\u201cI think people really love it,\u201d she said of the tree. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of history there, and so we don\u2019t want to lose it.\u201d"

So do trees even exist, scientifically?\nTom Kimmerer, a consulting forest scientist based in Kentucky, said yes \u2014 just not in the way you might think.\n\"Many years ago I asked my daughter Larkin, 'What's a tree?'\" Kimmerer told Live Science. \"And she could recognize them without fail. If a kid could recognize it, then a tree is some real entity we can recognize, even if the definition is difficult.\"\nRelated: Why does freshly cut grass smell so nice?\nKimmerer said a tree is simply a solution to a problem, and that problem is access to light.\nThe earliest plants on land were herbaceous \u2014 soft, non-woody plants like herbs and grasses that generally grow low to the ground. But the moment one plant grew taller than the others, there was competition for sunlight.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\n\"The attribute of being a long-lived \u2014 that is, perennial \u2014 plant that keeps its leaves above the leaves of the rest of the plants is what leads to a tree,\" Kimmerer said. \"All the other things that happen to trees have to happen in order for that to work efficiently.\"\nFor example, trees have thick trunks to support the weight above them and help them reach greater heights, and therefore more sunlight. Trees also have an efficient plumbing system to draw water up that high and bring nutrients back down \u2014 that's thanks to xylem and phloem, the tissues that form a tree's rings. Trees also have large, efficient root systems to supply all that water.\nHerbaceous plants have many of these features too: they have stems to support their weight, they have xylem and phloem to carry water and nutrients, and they have root systems. These features just don't have to do as much as they would in a plant that's several hundred feet tall.\nHerbaceous plants also aren't made of wood \u2014 and wood makes all the difference.\n\"Wood is one of the most amazing structures in the world because it's an adaptation that simultaneously solves multiple problems,\" Kimmerer said.\nWood does three things that are absolutely necessary for a tree: it's firm and flexible enough to support a tree's height, it's great at transporting water a long distance, and it's great at storing sugar. Without wood, trees would buckle under their own weight and struggle to get enough water and nutrients.\nBut as similar as their characteristics are, trees aren't all related to each other. They're just a habit, or a form that a plant can take. You can find trees all over the evolutionary map.\n\"There are lots of [plant] families that are only herbaceous,\" Kimmerer said. \"There are even more families that have both herbaceous and tree members. And then there are a few families that are only trees.\"\n\"If I were to show you a picture of a thousand different species of trees, you'd go, 'Wow, they're all different,'\" Kimmerer added. \"Just like we're all different. But their fundamental attributes are the ones that make a tree.\"\nOriginally published on Live Science.\nAshley Hamer is a contributing writer for Live Science who has written about everything from space and quantum physics to health and psychology.

      "text": "Amazon rainforest is approaching 'tipping points' that could transform it into a drier savanna\nResearchers caution that the Amazon rainforest could disappear in the next hundred years, due to the combined effects of climate change and deforestation, and a new model predicts how that could transpire.\nThe Amazon could be racing closer to a calamitous tipping point that would transform the lush rainforest into a drier savanna within a century, researchers warn.\nThis massive shift could be triggered by a combination of climate change and deforestation.\nThe Amazon rainforest is the largest tropical rainforest in the world, covering more than 2.3 million square miles (6 million square kilometers) and harboring 10% of the world's plant and animal species. The World Wide Fund estimates that the Amazon contains 99 billion to 154 billion tons (90 billion to 140 billion metric tons) of carbon and receives more than 70 inches (180 centimeters) of rain each year, on average. As such, it forms a key component of the global water and carbon cycles, which regulate the climate.\nIn the past century, rainforests like the Amazon have become increasingly vulnerable to stressors such as droughts and wildfires, driven by recent climate change and widespread deforestation. The World Resources Institute's Global Forest Review estimates that the Brazilian Amazon lost 11,000 square miles (28,000 square km) of forest \u2014 an area roughly the size of Massachusetts \u2014 in 2024 alone.\nSome scientists think these changes are pushing the Amazon toward a \"tipping point\" where the lush rainforest could transform into drier grassland. But other researchers disagree.\nIn a new study published Aug. 1 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, scientists revisited the Amazon's uncertain future. \"We are reasonably confident that such a shift is possible,\" said study co-author Andrew Friend, a professor of Earth systems science at the University of Cambridge. \"The question is what degree of climate change and/or deforestation will cause the system to change,\" Friend told Live Science in an email.\nRelated: What are the largest rainforests in the world?\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nUsing a computer model, the team tested how the Amazon rainforest would respond to the combined effects of climate change and deforestation. They used what's known as a \"single-column model,\" which in this case only simulated one average location within the Amazon basin to represent the entire area into which the Amazon River and its tributaries drain.\nThis type of model captures some of the complexities of a 3D global climate model, but it doesn't take into account how moisture and rainfall might change across different regions of the basin.\nBased on the model's results, the researchers identified three tipping points in the Amazon system: a 65% decrease in forest cover, a 10% decrease in moisture coming from the Atlantic Ocean, or a 6% decrease in rainfall. Beyond these thresholds, small changes in either the region's climate or forest cover could push the forest over the edge, transforming the ecosystem into a grassland.\nThe crux of this shift is a feedback loop between the land, vegetation and moisture in the atmosphere. Trees take up water from the soil through their roots and release water vapor into the atmosphere through their leaves, via evaporation and transpiration. That water vapor condenses in the atmosphere to form rain. Rainwater infiltrates the soil, where trees can access it. And so the cycle continues.\nFriend explained that with fewer trees, there's less evapotranspiration and rainfall, which dries out the forest and eventually turns it into a savanna. \"This change can be caused by deforestation, but climate change can also cause it, which changes the total amount of water entering the basin from the Atlantic Ocean,\" he said.\nThe team acknowledged that one limitation of their model was its inability to resolve spatial differences across the basin because it focused on only one spot.\nChris Boulton, a climate scientist at the University of Exeter who led a previous tipping point study, agreed. Boulton told Live Science in an email that it's extremely important to factor in where deforestation occurs. \"Deforesting areas close to the Atlantic can prevent evapotranspiration near the edge of the forest, and less water finds its way into the deeper parts,\" he said.\nSo, what can be done about it? The authors said that urgent action is needed. They indicated that even at the lower end of predicted climate-change scenarios, continued deforestation could decimate the Amazon rainforest within the next 100 years.\n\"Both climate change and deforestation have to be reduced over the next 10-20 years if we want to be confident that the system will remain intact,\" Friend said. \"Our understanding is far from complete, and we may be wrong about how the system will respond to these threats, but it would be unwise to rely on this possibility.\"\nAubrey Zerkle is a freelance science writer on topics spanning paleontology, Earth system evolution, astrobiology, and planetary science.

      "text": "The oldest tree in the world (and the 7 runner-ups)\nFrom Prometheus and Methuselah to trees in remote forests of China, these are the most ancient known trees on Earth.\nThe world's oldest trees were growing when the Great Pyramid of Giza was being built and were already thousands of years old when Julius Caesar came to power.\nTo determine a tree's age, scientists collect a core sample from the plant's base and then count its rings. This dating of tree rings is called dendrochronology and it can be a valuable tool for measuring tree age and studying environmental changes over time.\nHowever, due to rotting and the thickness of a tree\u2019s trunk, it's not always possible to get complete cores. Often tree ages are determined after it has died, but it is possible to get a core without killing it with a specialist tool that can extract a very narrow sample.\nIn addition, an infinitesimal percentage of old trees have been cored in the first place \u2014 according to a study published in Nature in 2015, Earth is home to over 3 trillion trees.\nHere are the longest-lived trees ever to be discovered on Earth.\n1. Prometheus (at least 4,900 years old when it was cut down)\nPrometheus, a Great Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva) in Wheeler Peak, Nevada, lived close to 5,000 years before it was cut down in 1964. It remains the longest-lived tree definitively documented.\nPrometheus met its end when geographer Donald R. Currey, who was studying ice age glaciology and had been granted permission to take core samples from pines in the park, cut it down (also with permission). Currey counted 4,862 rings and estimated the tree was more than 4,900-years-old.The stump Currey used to count the rings was not taken from the very bottom of the tree, so the tree was certainly older than 4,862 years.\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nRelated: Do trees exist (scientifically speaking)?\nThere are competing accounts as to why the tree was felled, according to the National Park Service. The most popular version is that Currey's coring tool got stuck and he cut down the tree as a result. Others suggest he cut down the tree to get a better count of its rings. Today, a piece of the tree can be viewed at the Great Basin Visitor Center in Nevada at the Great Basin National Park.\n2. Methuselah (at least 4,600 years old)\nSince 1957, this bristlecone pine has held the title of the world's oldest living tree. Methuselah was discovered by famed tree researcher Edmund Schulman, a scientist at the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research at the University of Arizona. He found Methuselah's age after taking cores from many bristlecones in the area and counting the rings.\nTo protect Methuselah from tourists, who might damage the tree by touching it or walking near its roots, the U.S. Forest Service has long kept Methuselah's exact location a secret and does not release photographs of it. The tree is somewhere along the 4.5-mile (7.2 kilometers) Methuselah Trail in the White Mountains of Inyo National Forest in California.\n3. Mystery tree (4,000 to 4,900 years old)\nIn the 2010s, rumors began to circulate that Schulman and his research team had unwittingly collected core samples from a tree older than Methuselah. Before his death in 2013, Tom Harlan, a scientist who worked with Schulman, said he found a core sample from another bristlecone pine tree that was at least 4,800 years old in the archives of the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research.\nHowever, Matthew Salzer, a research scientist at the Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research, has not been able to find that core. Salzer and a colleague used old notes to find the tree they believed Harlan was talking about, but they did not get a good enough sample to verify its age, according to the Washington Post. However, based on their imperfect core, they said the tree could be older than Methuselah but probably not as old as Prometheus. This tree is also in the White Mountains of California, but its location beyond that is secret.\n4. Alerce Milenario (2,400 to 5,400 years old)\nThe Alerce Milenario or Gran Abuelo (great-grandfather), in Chile's Alerce Costero National Park, made headlines in 2022 when researchers used computer modeling to estimate its age at 5,484 years.\nThe trunk of the alerce (Fitzroya cupressoides), also called a Patagonian cypress, is over 13 feet (4.3 meters) \u2014 so big that researchers could get only a partial core. On that core, they counted 2,400 tree rings and estimated the additional age using modeling. According to Science magazine, the tree was estimated to be 5,484 years old.\nThis type of modeling is not yet fully accepted by the scientific community, but the core alone makes this tree indisputably one of Earth's oldest. Alerce Milenario's location is not a secret, and tourists regularly visit and walk around its root system. Jonathan Barichivich, an environmental scientist who led the recent research into the tree, hoped the publicity this research generated would lead to more efforts to protect the tree.\n5. Giant sequoias (over 3,000 years old)\nLike alerces, California's giant sequoias (Sequoiadendron giganteum) are so large that tree coring tools generally can't adequately measure their age while the trees are alive. The most accurate estimates of old sequoia trees often come primarily from trees that have been cut down or fell due to natural causes, Peter Brown, founder of Rocky Mountain Tree-Ring Research, which maintains a list of the world's oldest scientifically verified trees, told Live Science in an email.\nFour giant sequoias over 3,000 years old have been discovered, though none are still standing. The President, in California's Sequoia National Park, is estimated to be over 3,200 years old.\nThe world's largest tree, General Sherman \u2014 also located in Sequoia National Park \u2014 is estimated to be about 2,200 years old.\n6. BLK 227 bald cypress (at least 2,624 years old)\nIn 2019, researchers announced the discovery of a 2,624-year-old bald cypress (Taxodium distichum). This unnamed tree is the oldest known living tree in eastern North America. It sits somewhere along North Carolina's Black River, a tributary of the Cape Fear River. As with many other old trees, its precise location has not been disclosed.\nResearchers found other trees that were over 2,000 years old in the same region. They took core samples from only a fraction of trees in the region \u2014 meaning older bald cypress trees might exist in the area.\n7. CB-90-11 (at least 2,435 years old)\nRocky Mountain bristlecone pines (Pinus aristata) are not thought to be as long-lived as their Great Basin relatives, but they can still achieve a very advanced age. A study published in 1992 provided evidence that these trees can live at least 2,500 years. The team looked at trees on Black Mountain and Almagre Mountain in Colorado. They found 12 living Rocky Mountain bristlecone pines that were more than 1,600 years old and four that were more than 2,100 years old. CB-90-11 was the oldest identified, with a minimum age of 2,435.\n8. Unnamed Qilian juniper (2,230 years old)\nIn 2019, researchers identified the oldest tree in China \u2014 a Qilian juniper (Juniperus przewalskii) in Delingha, Qinghai province, that was 2,230 years old in 2009. It was one of 98 documented trees that are more than 1,000 years old in China. The oldest trees in China tend to be found in remote mountain regions where they may have been more protected against threats such as logging and forest fires.\n9. Unverified trees\nAcross the world, there are trees that local oral traditions claim are thousands of years old. These include Sarv-e Abarkuh, a Persian cypress (Cupressus sempervirens) in Iran said to be more than 4,500 years old, and the Great Camphor of Takeo, a camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora) in Japan that's said to be more than 3,000 years old.\nThere is also the Llangernyw Yew, a common yew tree (Taxus baccata) in North Wales said to be up to 5,000 years old, and the Fortingall Yew in Scotland, which some traditions place at up to 9,000 years old. The ages of these trees and many others like them have not been scientifically verified, so their true ages are unknown.\nErik Ofgang is the co-author of The Good Vices: From Beer to Sex, The Surprising Truth About What\u2019s Actually Good For You and the author of Buzzed: A Guide to New England's Best Craft Beverages and Gillette Castle: A History.
