  "title": "17 expert tips for writing a self-help book",
  "description": "A successful business-focused self-help book starts with a clear message and a real understanding of your audience.",
  "content": "The self-help genre is full of big promises, but when writing for business professionals, inspiration alone won\u2019t cut it. These readers are often looking for practical insights they can apply quickly, with little patience for fluff or vague advice. That means authors need to bring clarity, credibility, and purpose to every page.\n\nTo help aspiring writers approach the process with intention, 17 Fast Company Executive Board members share what to consider before diving in. Follow their recommendations to craft a book that truly helps readers help themselves. 1. DETERMINE THE PROBLEM YOU\u2019RE TRYING TO SOLVE. Before writing or marketing a self-help book for business professionals, be crystal clear about the specific problem you\u2019re solving. General inspiration isn\u2019t enough\u2014identify a real challenge your target audience faces daily, then offer actionable frameworks. Books that succeed in this niche don\u2019t just motivate\u2014they provide tools that can be immediately applied. \u2013 Boris Dzhingarov, ESBO ltd\n\nResist the temptation to let AI write your book. Too many do\u2014and end up with something that reads just like everything else. If you want to stand out, use AI to research, uncover patterns, and challenge assumptions. Let your voice do the writing. That\u2019s what makes it worth reading. \u2013 Alex Goryachev\n\nKeep it short and sweet, and write in plain English. Avoid acronyms and industry jargon. Often, we are tempted to use ten-dollar words either because we are used to talking that way in our industry or because we simply think it will help us sound more intelligent. It fails every time. The best way to help someone help themselves is to be efficient in the use of your ideas and words. \u2013 John William Patton, ProVention Health Foundation Create a strong outline and try to write every single day. I was able to write my first book in 40 days because I wrote 1,000 words per day. Have an accountability partner to share progress and results. \u2013 Jo Ann Herold, Herold Growth Consulting\n\nKnow exactly who you\u2019re speaking to and what shift you\u2019re helping them make. Business professionals don\u2019t just want inspirational stories\u2014they want clarity, action, and proof that it works. Your message has to cut through the noise with real value, not just good, inspirational vibes. \u2013 Kristin Marquet, Marquet Media, LLC 6. FOCUS ON VALUE, NOT WORD COUNT.\n\nRethink the standard 60,000-word, 240-page convention. People want big, new ideas. But what they want more is time to execute\u2014and to live. Consider a shorter format. Think 20,000 to 30,000 words. Remember that business readers aren\u2019t paying for pages; they\u2019re paying for ideas. Give them something valuable that shifts their perspective, then give them back the time to implement it. \u2013 Jonathan Fields, Spark Endeavors | Good Life Project\u00ae Write for someone, not at them. The best self-help books start with a clear, specific reader in mind and offer lived insight, not just advice. At our marketing agency, we help founders clarify their message daily, and the most impactful stories always come from personal truth paired with practical value. \u2013 Sharon Lee Thony, SLT Consulting\n\nSharing your journey through writing reveals where you are now, but your audience must grow and relate to you through every step of the reflection. Use lessons learned, vivid anecdotes, and behind-the-scenes revelations that not only show your expertise but also build a bridge. This demonstrates that you understand where they are and are committed to guiding them with authority and compassion. \u2013 Larry Brinker Jr., BRINKER Embrace vulnerability as a secret weapon. Readers crave authenticity over perfection. Share failures, awkward moments, and the messy journey to success. This raw honesty fosters connection and trust, making your message resonate more with your audience. By revealing your true self, you invite readers into a shared experience, transforming them from mere consumers into passionate advocates. \u2013 Shawn Galloway, ProAct Safety, Inc.\n\nBefore writing, ask yourself if your reader would actually finish the book. Business professionals are short on time and long on information. Structure matters. Keep chapters tight, give them natural stopping points, and make it easy to return without losing the thread. A helpful book is one that people actually read. \u2013 Gianluca Ferruggia, DesignRush There is literally no new advice since \u201cSelf-Help\u201d was published in 1859 by Samuel Smiles. This is all true data. Therefore, you have no new ideas. Don\u2019t be sad; no one does. Sam covered it all. However, there is an opportunity for you to position your ideas in a niche way that will resonate more deeply with your audience. That\u2019s the opportunity. \u2013 Andrea Lechner-Becker, GNW Consulting",

Because her excitable energy has been known to be contagious. So, if you\u2019re looking to maintain a stale environment, look elsewhere.

She will bring a relatable, honest voice to any room.\nAndrea Lechner-Becker\nPublished content\nexpert panel\nJul 28, 2025\nTo build brand loyalty and engagement on Substack, create unique content that your audience can't find anywhere else.

At its core, wealth management is about making thoughtful decisions to grow, protect, and pass on what you\u2019ve built. For business leaders, that means managing not just personal finances but also how money moves through their companies, covering everything from tax strategy and risk management to succession planning. However, several common and persistent myths and missteps can stall or even hinder your financial well-being. To help you avoid these pitfalls, 14 Fast Company Executive Board members debunk the most common business wealth management myths and share what leaders should remember instead.\nexpert panel\nFrom setting expectations to fostering collaboration, department leaders need solid strategies to negotiate freelance contracts that drive mutual success. Freelancers and contractors have become essential contributors to today\u2019s flexible workforce. But managing those relationships requires a different playbook than hiring full-time staff. Department leaders must strike the right balance of collaboration, structure, and adaptability to build high-performing partnerships. To help, 13 Fast Company Executive Board members each share their best advice for negotiating freelance and contract-based work arrangements. Here's how they recommend handling your department's contractor agreements for mutual success.\nexpert panel\nBusinesses facing persistent workforce gaps must adopt smarter, more adaptive strategies to stay competitive.

To help you find your edge, 16 Fast Company Executive Board members reveal the strategies that are helping them close workforce gaps and keep momentum strong.\nexpert panel\nTo bring out the best in their remote teams, managers must adapt their leadership styles to meet each employee\u2019s unique needs, preferences, and work habits. Flexibility is essential to effective leadership, especially in remote and hybrid work environments. But flexibility doesn\u2019t mean being hands-off or vague\u2014it means knowing your people well enough to lead them intentionally, based on who they are and how they thrive. To that end, 20 Fast Company Executive Board members offer advice on how today\u2019s managers can adapt their leadership approach to meet the needs of remote team members. From customizing communication styles to co-creating expectations, these strategies offer practical guidance for leading with empathy, clarity, and results.\nexpert panel\nYour first big interview with the press can feel intimidating, but the right preparation can turn it into a defining moment for you as a brand leader.

A friend bullied me into hiring her - and I can\u2019t thank him enough. He saw that I was in a challenging point in life and that I needed to make tough decisions about my business and a family business. Camille became an outlet for me to process anxious thoughts. I came away with great tools, but it was the humanity - the conversations, the psychology conversations, and the strategic thought partnership that was so important to me.

This is precisely why working with her delivers results.\nCappy Daume\n| The Davis Companies\n\u201cCamille is a master of deep listening.
