  "description": "House minority leader decries plan confirmed by Pentagon while Chicago mayor calls it \u2018most flagrant violation of our constitution in the 21st century\u2019 \u2013 key US politics stories from Sunday 24 August",
  "content": "Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader and New York Democratic congressman, said Donald Trump had \u201cmanufactured a crisis\u201d to justify sending federalized national guard troops into Chicago next, over the heads of local leaders.\n\nJeffries, appearing on CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday, accused the US president of \u201cplaying games with the lives of Americans\u201d with his unprecedented domestic deployment of the military, which has escalated to include the arming of troops currently patrolling Washington DC \u2013 after sending troops into Los Angeles in June.\n\nThe mayor of Chicago, Brandon Johnson, said any such plan from Trump was perpetrating \u201cthe most flagrant violation of our constitution in the 21st century\u201d.\n\nHere are the key Trump administration news stories of the day:\n\nTrump \u2018manufactured crisis\u2019 to justify plan to send national guard to Chicago \u2013 Jeffries Planning is under way to send national guard troops to Chicago, an official at the Pentagon confirmed to ABC News on Sunday, as House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries accused Donald Trump of \u201cplaying games with the lives of Americans\u201d. \u201cWe won\u2019t speculate on further operations. The department is a planning organization and is continuously working with other agency partners on plans to protect federal assets and personnel,\u201d a Department of Defense official said, according to ABC. France summoned the American ambassador Charles Kushner after he wrote a letter to President Emmanuel Macron alleging France had failed to do enough to stem antisemitic violence, a French foreign ministry spokesperson said on Sunday. Sergei Lavrov, Moscow\u2019s most senior diplomat, praised efforts by Donald Trump to end the war, in an interview on NBC on Sunday, while US vice-president JD Vance said Washington would \u201ckeep on trying\u201d to broker talks in the absence of a deal. California\u2019s governor takes his gloves off to punch back at Trump In the opening weeks of Donald Trump\u2019s second term, Gavin Newsom wagered that peacemaking was best: a tarmac greeting for Air Force One, an Oval Office visit and a podcast slot for Maga\u2019s biggest names. But then Trump came for California, and its governor dropped the niceties. The president and his allies have been accused of executing a \u201cpattern of lawfare\u201d akin to those exerted by authoritarian regimes in Hungary and Russia after adopting a new strategy to target political opponents: allegations of mortgage fraud.\n\u2022 The justice department is alleging in a new court filing that three Smartmatic executives who were indicted last year on bribery and money-laundering charges transferred money from a 2018 voting machine contract with Los Angeles county into slush funds that were originally set up to pay bribes to overseas election officials.\n\nCatching up?

      "text": "In the opening weeks of Donald Trump\u2019s second term, Gavin Newsom wagered that peacemaking was best: a tarmac greeting for Air Force One, an Oval Office visit and a podcast slot for Maga\u2019s biggest names. But then Trump came for California, and its governor dropped the niceties.\nWith a flood of all-caps social media posts, a counterpunching redistricting proposal and a string of lawsuits challenging the new administration, Newsom is not just taking on Trump, he\u2019s stealing his tactics: fight, fight, fight.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to wake up, disabuse ourselves as Democrats,\u201d Newsom said on a podcast last week. \u201cI\u2019m sick of being weak. I\u2019m sick of being effete. I\u2019m sick of being non-consequential. It\u2019s not good enough to say it \u2013 it\u2019s time to do.\u201d\nNewsom has charged on to the national stage as a recast political brawler willing to wield power as ruthlessly as the other side. On Thursday, he signed redistricting legislation establishing a special election to ask voters to temporarily redraw the state\u2019s congressional boundaries and give Democrats as many as five additional US House seats in next year\u2019s midterm elections.\nThe ballot measure is a direct attempt to \u201cneuter and neutralize\u201d Texas\u2019s partisan gerrymander, engineered at Trump\u2019s behest, to safeguard Republicans\u2019 fragile House majority. At a bill-signing ceremony on Thursday, Newsom cited the president\u2019s claim that he was \u201centitled\u201d to five additional congressional seats in the Lone Star state: \u201cThat should put chills up your spine.\u201d\nNow the California referendum transforms an off-cycle election year into a high-stakes national showdown that could determine control of Congress \u2013 and set the stage for 2028. For Newsom, who\u2019s term-limited and widely viewed as a presidential contender, the success \u2013 or failure \u2013 of this 11-week sprint could carry major consequences for his political future.\nThe November special election gives voters in deep-blue California a chance to strike back at Trump, who has relentlessly tormented the state since returning to the White House. But by temporarily overriding California\u2019s independent redistricting commission \u2013 long a point of pride in the Golden state \u2013 Democrats are being asked to \u201ccompromise their own values,\u201d said Kim Nalder, a political science professor at California State University, Sacramento.\n\u201cThat\u2019s been a guiding light for a lot of Democrats \u2013 the whole \u2018they go low, we go high\u2019 idea,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the risks is that the Democratic party \u2013 and Newsom himself \u2013 become associated with this all-out brawl, no-holds-barred fighting, rather than having a particular set of political principles that they stand by no matter what.\u201d\nHow Californians will decide remains uncertain. A Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll released on Friday shows 48% of registered voters in the state support Newsom\u2019s redistricting plan, compared with 32% who oppose it. Another 20% are undecided, providing an opening for either campaign to make their pitch.\n\u201cIf Proposition 50 passes, and Californians succeed in adding more House seats, and is partially, if not completely, responsible for flipping the House next year, he\u2019s a hero, plain and simple,\u201d said Bill Whalen, a Hoover Institution fellow who was a speechwriter for Pete Wilson, the former Republican governor of California.\nEven if the initiative falls short in November, Whalen believes Newsom still benefits. \u201cHe still gets credit among those same Democrats for fighting the good fight,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see how he fails.\u201d\nThe all-out political war between the president and California\u2019s governor erupted earlier this summer, when Trump seized control of California\u2019s national guard and deployed US marines to Los Angeles, over Newsom\u2019s objections, to suppress protests against the federal immigration crackdown. The raids are ongoing, and Trump has targeted the state in other ways: an attempt to strip federal funding from UCLA, and tariffs that threaten California\u2019s economy \u2013 the fourth largest in the world.\nNewsom has argued that Trump was not just a threat to his state \u2013 but to the entire 249-year-old American project. While his approach might offend virtue-minded Democrats, he says the moment demands it.\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve changed,\u201d he said recently in a local news interview. \u201cThe facts have changed. We need to change.\u201d\nIn recent weeks, as Newsom has stepped up his attacks on Trump as a \u201cweak\u201d and a \u201cfailed\u201d leader, his social media team has trolled the president online \u2013 unleashing a jumble of unfiltered, stream-of-consciousness rants, AI-generated political fan art and schoolyard taunts, some of it signed with the governor\u2019s initials, GCN, meant to parody the president\u2019s own chaotic posting style.\nNewsom says he\u2019s simply holding up a mirror. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got issues with what I\u2019m putting out,\u201d he told reporters last week, \u201cyou sure as hell should have concerns about what he\u2019s putting out as president.\u201d\nThe posts have gone viral \u2013 racking up millions of views, thousands of comments and driving a flood of engagement. They\u2019ve also caught the attention of the right. Fox News hosts, Kid Rock, JD Vance and even Trump himself have all taken the bait, provoking what the governor\u2019s staff gleefully dubbed \u201cMaga meltdowns\u201d.\n\u201cJESSE WATTERS KEPT CALLING ME \u2018DADDY\u2019 (VERY WEIRD, NOT INTERESTED, BUT THANK YOU!)\u201d his office clapped back, in an 188-word tweet about Fox News\u2019s breathless coverage of Newsom\u2019s furious posting streak.\n\u201cGavin Newsom can mimic Donald Trump all that he wants to,\u201d Vance told Fox News host Laura Ingraham, \u201cthey\u2019re still going to lose unless they get better policies that actually serve the American people.\u201d\nTrump, for his part, weighed in on his own social media platform, Truth Social, vowing to save \u201cthe Once Great State of California\u201d from \u201cNewscum\u201d.\n\u201cTriggered?\u201d Newsom replied with a wink.\nThe Berkley poll suggested that California voters back his gloves-off strategy with the president by a nearly two-to-one margin, with just 29% saying they\u2019d prefer a more cooperative approach. The tougher posture lands especially well with younger voters: 71% of Californians under 30 say they approve.\nIn a blitz of media appearances last week, Newsom escalated his rhetoric.\n\u201cWe\u2019re fighting fire with fire,\u201d he said on The Siren podcast. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to punch these sons of bitches in the mouth.\u201d\nThe response was telling: no Democratic moralizing, no rebuke from party leaders, no pressure on Newsom to apologize. Instead, his team promoted the interview to his legions of new followers and supporters replied with MAGAesque AI images of the governor as a superhero.\n\u201cPeople are just not used to seeing this kind of rough around the edges, non-poll-tested messaging coming from Democrats,\u201d said Olivia Julianna, a 22-year-old Democratic activist from Texas and social media influencer who interviewed Newsom for the episode. \u201cIt\u2019s real, it\u2019s raw, it\u2019s authentic, and it shows that he\u2019s a fighter.\u201d\nAs Democrats brace for the loss of up to five US House seats in her state, under the redistricting plan approved by the Texas legislature on Saturday, Julianna said voters alarmed by Trump\u2019s increasingly brazen power grabs are desperate for leaders who offer more than just fighting words.\n\u201cWe want to feel like someone is standing on the frontlines ready to go to battle for us,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what it feels like Gavin Newsom is doing.\u201d\nNewsom\u2019s new fight-fire-with-fire strategy isn\u2019t always trained on Trump.\nWhen the Bed Bath & Beyond chair announced on Wednesday that he wouldn\u2019t reopen stores in the state, calling it \u201coverregulated, expensive and risky\u201d, Newsom\u2019s press office fired back. \u201cAfter their bankruptcy and closure of every store, like most Americans, we thought Bed, Bath & Beyond no longer existed,\u201d it said. \u201cWe wish them well in their efforts to become relevant again.\u201d\nHe\u2019s also taken on his own party. Earlier this year, Newsom declared the Democratic brand \u201ctoxic\u201d in an interview with provocateur Bill Maher \u2013 a diagnosis backed by polling and voter registration trends, but striking language for the leader of the largest blue state who could seek that same party\u2019s nomination.\nHe enraged progressives \u2013 already wary of his record on housing and homelessness \u2013 when he questioned the fairness of transgender athletes competing in women\u2019s sports. The comments, during a conversation with rightwing agitator Charlie Kirk on the inaugural episode of the governor\u2019s podcast, This Is Gavin Newsom, marked a split from other top Democrats on the issue and rattled some of his LGBTQ+ allies.\nIn response to a Guardian story about the loss of care for trans youth in California, a Newsom spokesperson said critics should point the finger at Trump, not at a governor whose \u201crecord supporting the trans community is unmatched\u201d.\n\u201cEveryone wants to blame Gavin Newsom for everything. But instead of indulging in Newsom derangement syndrome, maybe folks should look to Washington,\u201d the spokesperson said \u2013 invoking a pejorative phrase, \u201cderangement syndrome\u201d, used by Trump supporters to mock the president\u2019s detractors.\nWhile his sharper tone has angered some on the left, the redistricting gambit has managed to unite progressives and establishment Democrats \u2013 sending Newsom\u2019s once-stalled approval rating soaring.\nHis redistricting plan has drawn praise from across the party, including Barack Obama, who called it \u201ca responsible approach\u201d, the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi and the entire congressional delegation of California Democrats. With the ballot initiative in motion, he challenged other blue state leaders to follow suit, laying down the gauntlet for fellow Democratic governors with presidential ambitions as Trump expands his push to secure Republican advantages in states such as Indiana, Ohio and Missouri.\nThat aggressive posture \u2013 in effect becoming an \u201canti-Trump troll\u201d \u2013 has been cathartic for many Democrats, Nalder said.\n\u201cDemocrats nationwide have been feeling like the Trump administration has been punching their values and their party and democracy itself in the face repeatedly day after day and they\u2019re just ready for somebody to punch the bully back,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Newsom right now looks like he could be that guy.\u201d\nNewsom\u2019s campaign faces mounting opposition from Republicans, including those not in Trump\u2019s Maga camp. The popular former Republican governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, a longtime Trump critic and advocate of independent redistricting, has promised to TERMINATE GERRYMANDERING\u201d.\nFormer House speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, has also vowed to pump money into what some observers predict could quickly become one of the most expensive contests in Golden state history.\n\u201cThe voters of California have a say,\u201d he said in an interview on CNN. \u201cIf you truly believe in your power of your own vote, you should vote against this.\u201d\nNewsom has raised more than $6.2m from 200,000 donations in the week since he officially launched the ballot campaign at a rally in Los Angeles last week, according to his team.\nThere, Newsom stood side by side with labor leaders, members of the teacher\u2019s union and the head of California\u2019s Planned Parenthood. His redistrticting plan even earned the endorsement of Sara Sadhwani, a Democrat who served on California\u2019s 2020 independent redistricting commission. Making the case for tossing out her work, she declared: \u201cExtraordinary times call for extraordinary measures\u201d.\nAs Newsom spoke at the Japanese American National Museum\u2019s National Center for the Preservation of Democracy earlier this month, federal agents, armed and masked, fanned out across the complex. Newsom said their presence could not have been coincidental, though a Trump administration official called the accusation \u201cmisinformed\u201d.\nThe next day, the governor\u2019s office filed a freedom of information request seeking details on the administration\u2019s involvement in the decision to send border patrol agents to that location.\nIt was just more fuel for Newsom\u2019s argument: his campaign is not just about congressional districts, but a referendum on Trump \u2013 and American democracy.\n\u201cDonald Trump, you have poked the bear,\u201d Newsom says in a new ad for the redistricting campaign, as the camera flashes to the grizzly on the state\u2019s flag. \u201cAnd we will punch back.\u201d"

      "text": "France summoned the American ambassador Charles Kushner after he wrote a letter to President Emmanuel Macron alleging France had failed to do enough to stem antisemitic violence, a French foreign ministry spokesperson said on Sunday.\nKushner, who is Jewish and whose son is married to US President Donald Trump\u2019s daughter, published the open letter in the Wall Street Journal amid deep divides between France and the US and Israel.\nKushner\u2019s letter to Macron noted that Monday was \u201cthe 81st anniversary of the Allied Liberation of Paris, which ended the deportation of Jews from French soil\u201d under Nazi German occupation.\nHe wrote: \u201cI write out of deep concern over the dramatic rise of antisemitism in France and the lack of sufficient action by your government to confront it...\n\u201cIn France, not a day passes without Jews assaulted in the street, synagogues or schools defaced, or Jewish-owned businesses vandalized,\u201d he added.\nIn the letter, he urged French president Emmanuel Macron to more urgently enforce hate-crime laws and tone down criticism of Israel, saying French government statements about recognising a Palestinian state have fuelled antisemitic incidents in France.\nWhile \u201cantisemitism has long scarred French life\u201d, the ambassador argued that hatred of Jews \u201chas exploded since Hamas\u2019s barbaric assault on October 7, 2023,\u201d which triggered the ongoing war in Gaza.\n\u201cFrance firmly refutes these latest allegations,\u201d said a foreign ministry statement in response, hours after the letter\u2019s contents were made public.\n\u201cThe Ambassador\u2019s allegations are unacceptable,\u201d the ministry said, adding Kushner would be due to appear on Monday.\nThe ministry said the 1961 Vienna Convention meant ambassadors were not permitted to interfere in a country\u2019s internal affairs. Kushner would be summoned to the foreign ministry on Monday, it added.\nKushner\u2019s letter follows another sent to Macron by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week in which Netanyahu accused Macron of contributing to antisemitism by calling for international recognition of a Palestinian state, according to the Jerusalem Post.\nMacron has emerged as one of the more forceful critics of Netanyahu\u2019s prosecution of the war in Gaza, particularly with regard to Palestinian civilian casualties, while Trump has steadfastly supported the Israeli leader.\n\u201cPublic statements haranguing Israel and gestures toward recognition of a Palestinian state embolden extremists, fuel violence, and endanger Jewish life in France. In today\u2019s world, anti-Zionism is antisemitism \u2013 plain and simple,\u201d Kushner wrote.\nKushner\u2019s son Jared Kushner is married to Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump, who converted to Judaism before their wedding in 2009. They have three children who are being raised Jewish.\nMacron has publicly criticized antisemitism as antithetical to French values and increased security to protect synagogues and other Jewish centres in response to antisemitic incidents linked to the Gaza conflict.\nFrance is home to western Europe\u2019s largest Jewish population at around half a million people, as well as a significant Muslim community sensitive to the plight of the Palestinian people in Gaza.\nBoth communities have reported a spike in hate crimes since Israel\u2019s retaliatory offensive against the Palestinian militant group Hamas in the besieged coastal strip.\nMacron\u2019s announcement that France would formally recognise a Palestinian state during a UN meeting in September drew a swift rebuke from Israel at the time.\nWith the move, France is set to join a list of nations that has grown since the start of the Gaza war nearly two years ago.\nFrance is among at least 147 of the 193 UN members that now recognise or plan to recognise a Palestinian state, according to a recent New York Times report.\nAFP contributed reporting"

      "text": "Planning is underway to send national guard troops to Chicago, an official at the Pentagon confirmed to ABC News on Sunday.\n\u201cWe won\u2019t speculate on further operations. The Department is a planning organization and is continuously working with other agency partners on plans to protect federal assets and personnel,\u201d a Department of Defense official said, according to ABC.\nEarlier on Sunday, Hakeem Jeffries, House minority leader and New York Democratic congressman, said Donald Trump has \u201cmanufactured a crisis\u201d to justify sending federalized national guard troops into Chicago next, over the heads of local leaders.\nJeffries, appearing on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, accused the US president of \u201cplaying games with the lives of Americans\u201d with his unprecedented domestic deployment of the military, which has escalated to include the arming of troops currently patrolling Washington, DC \u2013 after sending troops into Los Angeles in June.\nThe mayor of Chicago, Brandon Johnson, said any such plan from Trump was perpetrating \u201cthe most flagrant violation of our constitution in the 21st century\u201d.\nLate on Friday, Pentagon officials confirmed to Fox News that up to 1,700 men and women of the national guard were poised to mobilize in 19 mostly Republican states to support Trump\u2019s anti-immigration crackdown by assisting the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (Ice) with \u201clogistical support and clerical functions\u201d.\nJeffries said he supported a statement issued by the Democratic governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker, that Trump was \u201cabusing his power\u201d in talking about sending the national guard to Chicago, and distracting from the pain he said the president was causing American families.\nThe national guard is normally under the authority of the individual states, deployed at the request of the state governor and only federalized \u2013 or deployed by the federal government \u2013 in a national emergency and at the request of a governor.\nJeffries said in an interview with CNN on Sunday morning: \u201cWe should continue to support local law enforcement and not simply allow Donald Trump to play games with the lives of the American people as part of his effort to manufacture a crisis and create a distraction because he\u2019s deeply unpopular.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cI strongly support the statement that was issued by Governor Pritzker making clear that there\u2019s no basis, no authority for Donald Trump to potentially try to drop federal troops into the city of Chicago.\u201d\nThe White House has been working on plans to send national guard to Chicago, the third largest US city, dominated by Democratic voters in a Democratic state, to take a hard line on crime, homelessness and immigrants, the Washington Post reported.\nPritzker issued a statement on Saturday night that began: \u201cThe State of Illinois at this time has received no requests or outreach from the federal government asking if we need assistance, and we have made no requests for federal intervention.\u201d\nTrump has argued that a military crackdown was necessary in the nation\u2019s capital, and elsewhere, to quell what he said were out of control levels of crime, even though statistics show that serious and violent crime in Washington, and many other American cities, has actually plummeted.\nTalking to reporters in the Oval Office on Friday the president insisted that \u201cthe people in Chicago are screaming for us to come\u201d as he laid out his plan to send troops there, and that they would later \u201chelp with New York\u201d.\n\u201cWhen ready, we will start in Chicago \u2026 Chicago is a mess,\u201d Trump said.\nJohnson, in an appearance on Sunday on MSNBC, said shootings had dropped by almost 40% in his city in the last year alone, and he and Pritzker said any plan by the White House to override local authority and deploy troops would be illegal.\n\u201cThe president has repeated this petulant presentation since he assumed office. What he is proposing at this point would be the most flagrant violation of our constitution in the 21st century,\u201d Johnson said.\nCalifornia sued the federal government when it deployed national guard and US marines to parts of Los Angeles in June over protests against Ice raids, but a court refused to block the troops.\nMain target cities mentioned by Trump are not only majority Democratic in their voting but also run by Black mayors, including Washington, DC, Chicago, New York, Baltimore, Los Angeles and Oakland.\nRahm Emanuel, a Democratic former Illinois congressman, chief of staff to former president Barack Obama, and a former mayor of Chicago, also appeared on CNN on Sunday urging people to reflect that Trump, in two terms of office, had only ever deployed US troops in American cities, never overseas.\nEmanuel said if he was still mayor he would call on the president to act like a partner and, although crime was coming down, to \u201cwork with us on public safety\u201d to combat carjackings, gun crime and gangs and not \u201ccome in and act like we can be an occupied city\u201d.\nHe added about Trump\u2019s agenda: \u201cHe gave his speech in Iowa, he said \u2018I hate\u2019 Democrats, and this may be a reflection of that.\u201d The speech was in July, when Trump excoriated Democrats in Congress who refused to vote for his One Big Beautiful Bill, the flagship legislation of the second Trump administration so far that focuses on tax cuts for the wealthy, massive boosts for the anti-immigration agenda and benefits cuts to programs such as Medicaid, which provides health insurance for poor Americans."

      "text": "Russia accused western European leaders on Sunday of not wanting peace in Ukraine, as Moscow\u2019s most senior diplomat praised efforts by Donald Trump to end the war, while Vice-President JD Vance said the US would \u201ckeep on trying\u201d to broker talks in the absence of a deal.\nSergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, made the comments during a sometimes contentious interview on NBC on Sunday morning, during which he denied his country had bombed civilian targets in Ukraine.\nTrump, he said, had set himself above European leaders who accompanied Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy for talks at the White House last week, immediately after the summit between the US president and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, on 15 August.\n\u201cWe want peace in Ukraine. He wants, President Trump wants, peace in Ukraine. The reaction to [the] Anchorage meeting, the gathering in Washington of these European representatives and what they were doing after Washington, indicates that they don\u2019t want peace,\u201d Lavrov said.\nThe Alaska talks produced neither a ceasefire nor an agreement for Zelenskyy and Putin to meet, and was widely considered to be a public relations triumph for the Russian leader.\nLavrov brushed aside Trump\u2019s apparent frustration at the outcome and the US warning of \u201cmassive sanctions or massive tariffs or both\u201d against Moscow. He said \u201cyes\u201d when asked if Putin wanted peace and said Putin and Trump respected each other, while assailing the alliance of leaders such as France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron, Germany\u2019s Friedrich Merz, Britain\u2019s Keir Starmer and European Union president Ursula von der Leyen who came to the White House last week to bolster Zelenskyy\u2019s visit.\nEuropean leaders in recent days have pledged to support security guarantees as part of a peace agreement, although Russia has flatly rejected the prospect of troops from countries in Europe being positioned in Ukraine.\nTrump has ruled out sending the US military, and on Friday it was reported that his administration had blocked Ukraine\u2019s use of US-supplied long-range missiles to attack Russia.\nMeanwhile, Canadian prime minister Mark Carney told Zelenskyy on Sunday that he backed Ukraine\u2019s calls for robust security guarantees and that Canada would not rule out sending troops.\nEarlier, Lavrov became defensive when NBC asked him if Putin was \u201cstringing along\u201d Trump by appearing conciliatory to his peace overtures but continuing to bomb Ukraine, attacks which last week included an airstrike on an American electronics manufacturing company in the west of the country.\n\u201cIt is not for the lawmakers or for any media outlet to decide what President Trump is motivated by. We respect President Trump because President Trump defends American national interests. And I have reason to believe that President Trump respects President Putin because he defends Russian national interests,\u201d he said.\nCritics, including some conservative voices, are alarmed by what they see as Putin manipulating Trump over Ukraine and US elections.\nLavrov meanwhile denied that Russia attacks civilian targets including schools, hospitals and churches, hinting at Russia\u2019s extraordinary claims throughout the war that Ukraine is attacking its own people.\n\u201cOur intelligence has very good information, and we target only military enterprises, military sites or industrial enterprises directly involved in producing military equipment for [the] Ukrainian army,\u201d he said.\nVance appeared separately in the same Sunday morning program and insisted Russia deserved credit for indicating it was ready to end a conflict that Trump has said more than 50 times he would solve \u201cin one day\u201d, while in contrast the vice-president warned of a longer process.\n\u201cI think the Russians have made significant concessions to President Trump for the first time in three and a half years of this conflict,\u201d Vance said.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve recognized that they\u2019re not going to be able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv. That was, of course, a major demand at the beginning. And importantly, they\u2019ve acknowledged that there is going to be some security guarantee to the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\u201d\nVance said historically that peace negotiations go \u201cin fits and starts\u201d and warned that he did not think ending the war was \u201cgoing to happen overnight\u201d.\nVance said of Russia, in a comment that was not further clarified: \u201cShould they have started the war? Of course, they haven\u2019t. But we\u2019re making progress\u201d. Trump in February blamed Ukraine, saying, \u201cyou never should have started it.\u201d\nAny sanctions against Russia, Vance said, would be on a \u201ccase by case basis\u201d, but he remained hopeful that US efforts could bring Zelenskyy and Putin together.\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated, but we\u2019re going to keep on trying to convince these parties to talk to each other and continue to play the game of diplomacy, because that\u2019s the only way to get this thing wrapped up.\u201d\nLavrov remained adamant that Russia also wanted peace, and acknowledged \u201cUkraine has the right to exist\u201d. But he said it \u201cmust let people go\u201d, referring to Putin\u2019s demand that it give up Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula seized by Russia in 2014, as well as southern and eastern parts, such as the Donbas, captured since 2022, as part of a peace agreement.\n\u201cIn Crimea [they] decided that they belong to the Russian culture,\u201d he said, citing a disputed 2014 referendum condemned by most of the world as illegal.\nOn Friday, Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat of Connecticut, said on CNN that stronger US action was needed because \u201cPutin is not going to stop until we stop him.\u201d\n-\nReuters contributed reporting"

      "text": "Donald Trump and his allies have been accused of executing a \u201cpattern of lawfare\u201d akin to those exerted by authoritarian regimes in Hungary and Russia after adopting a new strategy to target political opponents: allegations of mortgage fraud.\nFirst it was Letitia James, the New York attorney general, then it was Adam Schiff, a California senator. Now, the president is targeting Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook, demanding she resign and threatening to fire her.\nCook, the first Black woman to be appointed a Fed governor, was appointed in 2022 by Joe Biden. Her 14-year term is not due to expire until 2038.\nLeading this new strategy is Bill Pulte, heir to a home construction company fortune, appointed by Trump to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees regulations of federal housing lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\nPulte has used his role to publicly accuse Trump\u2019s opponents, publishing extraordinary allegations on social media and referring them for investigation.\nHe alleges that James, Schiff and Cook committed what is known as owner-occupancy fraud, when a person claims a second home or investment property is actually a primary residence to get better mortgages. Lenders are more inclined to give borrowers a lower mortgage on a primary residence, compared with a second home or investment property.\nIn a letter to the Department of Justice, Pulte claimed that Cook \u201cfalsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms\u201d. In other online posts and on TV news appearances, Pulte said that Cook should resign or be fired over the allegations, which have not been verified.\nJames and Schiff have denied the allegations. Cook has pledged to \u201cprovide the facts\u201d after gathering the relevant information.\nTrump allies have celebrated the accusations, citing it as evidence of corruption within the Democratic party. \u201cThis is not just hypocrisy, this is poetic justice,\u201d said Fox conservative commentator Laura Ingraham, of Schiff\u2019s fraud accusations, in a clip Trump reposted to social media.\nWhile Pulte has targeted two prominent Democrats and a Democratic appointee, accusations of such fraud are not exclusive to the party: an investigation by the Associated Press found Texas attorney general Ken Paxton, a Republican and staunch Trump ally, and his then wife claimed that three homes were their primary residences.\nThough Paxton has not commented on his own mortgage fraud accusations, he had said of the accusations against attorney general James: \u201cI hope that if she\u2019s done something wrong, I hope that she\u2019s held accountable.\u201d\nOwner-occupancy fraud is not uncommon. Philadelphia Fed researchers in 2023 estimated that over 20,000 loans were given to \u201cfraudulent investors\u201d, or people who purchased more than one home they listed as a primary residence within a year.\nSome political experts have raised concerns that the president and his allies are blatantly using the legal system to intimidate political opponents. \u201cThe fact that the law is being selectively applied underlines that this is part of a pattern of lawfare,\u201d Don Moynihan, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan, told the Guardian via email.\n\u201cWhat we are seeing is the type of weaponization we associate with authoritarian regimes, like Hungary, Turkey or Russia,\u201d Moynihan added. \u201cI would say that this is a massive warning sign, but the reality is that we have seen so many of these signs at this point.\u201d\nContacted for comment, a US federal housing spokesperson said: \u201cWe refer people of all political parties for mortgage fraud, and we will continue to do so.\u201d\nA White House official said: \u201cAnyone who engages in criminal activity should be held accountable. No one is above the law.\u201d\n\u2018No intention of being bullied\u2019\nThat Trump is targeting a Fed governor speaks to the president\u2019s continued antagonism against the Federal Reserve. Compared with James or Schiff, both of whom have headed investigations against Trump, Cook has not singled herself out as an enemy to the president.\nBut her role on the 12-person Fed governing board that sets interest rates has probably made her a target. Since taking office in January, Trump has demanded the central bank cut rates, disregarding the precedent set by his predecessors; the Fed has historically been treated as an independent institution, free from political influence, by past presidents.\nThe Fed board hasn\u2019t yet lowered rates during any of the five meetings it had this year, which has infuriated Trump. Policymakers, including the central bank\u2019s chair, Jerome Powell, say the administration\u2019s tariffs have clouded the economic outlook and raises the risk of higher inflation.\nPulte has pushed himself into the heart of the action, criticizing the Fed on social media and reportedly even drafting a letter for Trump \u2013 which remains unsent \u2013 to fire Powell. \u201cJerome Powell\u2019s career is done,\u201d Pulte wrote in July.\n\u201cCould somebody please inform Jerome \u2018Too Late\u2019 Powell that he is hurting the housing industry very badly? People can\u2019t get a mortgage because of him,\u201d Trump wrote on social media earlier this week.\nTrump\u2019s gut-reaction to seize control of the Fed is to fire Powell, but neither the stock market nor the US supreme court have responded kindly to such threats. So, Trump, with Pulte\u2019s help, has spent the summer following other tactics.\nIn July, Trump zeroed in on renovations that were taking place at the Fed\u2019s headquarters in Washington DC, claiming that the renovations were fraudulent because they were more expensive than what was originally budgeted, costing $2.5bn instead of $1.9bn. The Fed put this down to complications that came up during renovations.\nBut as criticisms of the renovations died down, Trump started zeroing in on Cook. Her exit would allow Trump to appoint a replacement who may be more sympathetic to his desire for lower rates.\nIn a statement, Cook said that she has \u201cno intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet\u201d, adding: \u201cI do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\u201d\nOn Friday, Trump threatened to fire her if she did not resign."

Key US politics stories from Saturday 23 August\nThe immigrant population of the United States, which has been growing for more than 50 years, has declined by more than a million people since Donald Trump took office in January.\nAccording to a new study by the Pew Research Center, there were a record 53.3 million immigrants in the US in January, when Trump took office for the second time. By June, that number had dropped to 51.9 million.\nAmong all US residents, 15.4% were immigrants as of June 2025, down from the recent historic high of 15.8% in January.\nThe Pew survey also found that 750,000 immigrant workers had dropped out of the US labor force since January, which is now 19% foreign-born."

      "text": "Donald Trump has threatened to take his federal crackdown on crime and city cleanliness to New York and Chicago, as the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, ordered that national guard troops patrolling the streets of Washington DC under federal control will now be armed.\nThe US president talked to reporters in the Oval Office and said: \u201cWhen ready, we will start in Chicago \u2026 Chicago is a mess.\u201d He added that then the administration \u201cwill help with New York\u201d, amid the controversial and aggressive federal efforts to control leading Democratic-voting cities, each of which has a Black mayor.\nOn the issue of suddenly announcing that it would now arm the federalized troops in DC, the defense department did not immediately offer any other details about the new development or why it was needed.\nThe step is an escalation in the federal government\u2019s rare intervention into policing in the nation\u2019s capital and came as nearly 2,000 national guard members are stationed in the city.\nEarlier this week hundreds of troops from several Republican-led states arrived to bolster the DC national guard.\nThe Pentagon and the US army had said last week that troops would not carry weapons.\nThe city had been informed about the intent for the national guard to be armed, a person familiar with the conversations said earlier this week. The person was not authorized to disclose the plans and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\nA defense official told CNN: \u201cAt the direction of the secretary of defense, [Joint Task Force] JTF-DC members supporting the mission to lower the crime rate in our nation\u2019s capital will soon be on mission with their service-issued weapons, consistent with their mission and training.\u201d\nTrump took command of the Washington DC police department earlier this month and deployed the national guard, under laws and constitutional powers that give the federal government more sway over the nation\u2019s capital than other cities. The US president claims that crime and homelessness in the district constitute a crisis, against the objections of local leaders.\nElsewhere, the national guard is under the jurisdiction of the relevant state, where the state governor is the force\u2019s commander-in-chief and can deploy that military in case of emergency. In rare circumstances the federal government takes control of a state\u2019s national guard in what is deemed a national emergency, typically at the request of the state governor in question.\nEarlier this summer, Trump federalized the California national guard over the objection of the state\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, in an almost unprecedented abnormality, sending troops into parts of Los Angeles to counter protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).\nHegseth\u2019s orders come just a day after Jeanine Pirro, the District of Columbia\u2019s top federal prosecutor, instructed prosecutors to pursue the most serious charges possible in cases stemming from recent arrests, limiting their discretion as the Trump administration intensifies its law enforcement presence in the capital.\nThat directive, first reported by the New York Times, was issued this week and narrows the ability of line prosecutors to decide how cases are charged and prioritized. By pushing for the maximum charges allowed, the new policy could lead to longer prison terms for convicted defendants.\n\u201cIn line with President Trump\u2019s directive to make DC safe, US attorney Pirro has made it clear that the old way of doing things is unacceptable,\u201d spokesman Tim Lauer told the newspaper. \u201cShe directed her staff to charge the highest crime that is supported by the law and the evidence.\u201d\nPirro, who was formerly a Fox News host, has been a prominent figure in the administration\u2019s law-enforcement push. She has also pressed for changes to local laws that she argues treat juvenile offenders too leniently.\nThe DC attorney\u2019s office holds a unique position, overseeing federal and local prosecutions since the District of Columbia is not a state. The office has long debated how to handle lower-level arrests made by the city\u2019s police department.\nAccording to the White House, federal agents have made more than 630 arrests as of Thursday, though the justice department has not clarified how that figure compares with typical city police numbers.\nWhile Pirro has committed to filing the toughest charges possible in most cases, she has also relaxed enforcement of one local gun law. This week she directed prosecutors not to pursue felony charges against people for possessing rifles or shotguns in the city, despite a DC law prohibiting them.\nThe policy does not apply to cases involving violent crimes or individuals barred from owning firearms, Pirro said in a statement to CNN. She said that the change follows guidance from the US supreme court and the justice department\u2019s solicitor general.\nOn Thursday, Trump declared his takeover of the Metropolitan police department to be a success.\nHe had previously signaled that he would target other cities, such as Baltimore, Oakland and another mission in Los Angeles, as well as New York and Chicago, which are all strongly Democratic-voting and run by Black mayors. The Maryland governor, Wes Moore, said to CNN that crime was dropping in Baltimore as a result of community violence prevention efforts and he would never activate the national guard \u201cfor theatrics\u201d.\nBaltimore\u2019s mayor, Brandon Scott, also spoke to CNN, accusing Trump of \u201csingling out Black cities\u201d and Moore said that the cities the president was now targeting \u201care places he has never been, streets he has never walked\u201d."

      "text": "The justice department is alleging in a new court filing that three Smartmatic executives who were indicted last year on bribery and money-laundering charges transferred money from a 2018 voting machine contract with Los Angeles county into slush funds that were originally set up to pay bribes to election officials in Venezuela and the Philippines between 2012 and 2016 to obtain and retain lucrative election contracts.\nProsecutors say one of the executives transferred an undisclosed amount from the $282m LA county contract into the slush funds in 2019 but did not say if anyone actually received bribes from the county\u2019s money at that point. The government is seeking to prove the funds were part of a long pattern of bribing election officials by Smartmatic, the voting machine company, which sued Fox News for defamation after the 2020 election.\nA separate court filing in a lawsuit brought by Fox News against LA county to obtain records about Smartmatic\u2019s relationship with Dean Logan, LA county\u2019s registrar-recorder and county clerk who oversees elections and the Smartmatic contract, Fox News asserts that Logan may have received inappropriate gifts from the company in the form of business-class travel and upscale restaurant meals. Logan is supposed to report vendor gifts above $50 on annual disclosure forms, but records obtained by Fox News and included in the court filing show he did not report some gifts from Smartmatic. Logan maintains he was not required to report the travel or a meal that Fox highlights in its filing. Fox News is seeking the records from LA county to support its defense against a defamation suit filed against it by Smartmatic in 2021.\nLast year, prosecutors in Florida filed corruption charges against the president of UK-based Smartmatic, along with two other current and former executives, for allegedly operating a years-long bribery and money-laundering scheme that paid bribes to an election official in the Philippines. The justice department has since said that the scheme involved payments to officials in Venezuela as well, where the company obtained its first elections contract in 2004.\nUS election integrity activists have long been concerned about Smartmatic\u2019s contract with LA county, due to the company\u2019s controversial history, the founders\u2019 ties to Venezuela and a lack of transparency over company ownership. The company first tried to get into the US elections market in 2006, but a federal investigation into its ownership and potential ties to the Venezuelan government at the time put a halt to its US ambitions until it obtained the contract with LA county in 2018. Concerns about the company and its role in US elections increased last year when the justice department indicted its executives.\nThe new revelations about the LA county money raise even more questions about the county\u2019s contract. Prosecutors allege that the Smartmatic executives conspired for years with the owner of Jarltech International, a hardware maker in Taiwan that manufactured voting machines for Smartmatic, to overcharge customers for the systems it built then used the excess money to pay bribes to election officials in the Philippines and Venezuela. Prosecutors do not say if they overcharged LA county as well or if any LA county money actually got paid out in bribes to anyone \u2013 only that some of that money made it into slush funds that had been used in the past to pay bribes. The justice department declined to answer questions about the case but said in a court filing that it has documents and witness testimony to support its claims about LA county\u2019s money.\nSmartmatic itself has not been accused of wrongdoing, only the three executives. But a Smartmatic spokesperson says the justice department allegations are \u201cfilled with misrepresentations\u201d and also says the company operates \u201cethically\u201d and abides \u201cby all laws always, both in Los Angeles county and every jurisdiction where we operate\u201d.\nThe new allegations are not part of charges the justice department brought against the Smartmatic executives. Prosecutors are only asking a Florida court to allow evidence about the LA county money to show a pattern in how the executives managed their alleged bribery and money-laundering scheme.\nAfter news of the indictments broke last year, the county barred the three executives from any further association with its Smartmatic contract but did not \u201cdebar\u201d the company itself, something it can do if a contractor shows a lack of \u201cbusiness integrity or business honesty\u201d. The county can also terminate a contract if a vendor gives any county officer or employee \u201cimproper consideration\u201d in the form of travel, entertainment or tangible gifts to secure favor. But Logan\u2019s office says it stands by its work with the company. With regard to the implication that LA county money that got into the slush funds might have come from overcharging the county, Logan says the county\u2019s contract with Smartmatic uses fixed pricing.\n\u201cThe alleged actions in the federal matter are unrelated to the work performed under contract by Smartmatic for Los Angeles County,\u201d according to a statement sent by Logan in an email. \u201cThe County has no knowledge or visibility into how Smartmatic USA used proceeds from that contract; however, the County does validate work performed and deliverable requirements aligned to the fixed price structure of the contract prior to making any payments.\u201d\nThe contract runs through March 2027, but has three, two-year extension options that, if exercised, would stretch the agreement to 2033. It also does allow for changes in pricing up to 10% of the contracted amounts.\nThe three indicted executives include company president and co-founder, Roger Alejandro Pi\u00f1ate Martinez Jr; Jorge Vasquez, former vice-president of hardware development for Smartmatic\u2019s US division; and Elie Moreno, who oversaw the company\u2019s contracts. According to a company bio, Pi\u00f1ate, who goes by Roger Pi\u00f1ate, played a \u201ccritical\u201d role in winning the LA county contract and was chief operating officer until becoming president in 2018, the year Smartmatic won the Los Angeles contract.\nPi\u00f1ate is a Venezuelan citizen and permanent US resident, and Elie Moreno is a Venezuelan-Israeli. The company put Pi\u00f1ate and Moreno on administrative leave after the announcement of their indictments last year, and currently Ruliena Pi\u00f1ate, Roger\u2019s cousin, oversees Smartmatic\u2019s LA contract with another employee. She was co-president with her cousin before his indictment. Vasquez, a US citizen, left Smartmatic in 2021 in the midst of the justice department investigation. The justice department accuses him of receiving direct kickbacks for his role in the alleged scheme.\nControversial beginnings\nSmartmatic has been dogged by controversy almost since its founding in Florida in 1999 by Pi\u00f1ate and two fellow Venezuelan engineers \u2013 Antonio Mugica and Alfredo Jos\u00e9 Anzola \u2013 as a network applications developer.\nThe company shifted to voting machines in 2004 when then-Venezuelan president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez was threatened with a recall referendum. Months before the recall election, Venezuela\u2019s National Electoral Council announced it would replace the country\u2019s six-year-old voting machines with new ones under a $91m contract awarded to Smartmatic, Bizta \u2013 a small software firm owned by Mugica and his father \u2013 and the state-run telecom CANTV. Smartmatic and Bizta got the contract despite having no experience in voting machines or elections. There were other concerns about the deal as well: the Venezuelan government owned 28% of Bizta through a $200,000 investment in the firm, a close associate of Ch\u00e1vez was on Bizta\u2019s board, and two of the five members of the electoral council denounced the contract, citing irregularity with the bidding process.\nCh\u00e1vez survived his recall battle, though not without additional controversy: he and his supporters were accused of rigging the election based on an outcome that differed from an exit poll. However, after an audit of the results, the US-based Carter Center, which monitors overseas elections, supported the outcome, as did the US state department.\nRiding its success in Venezuela, Smartmatic tried to enter the US elections market in 2006 by using money from the Venezuela contract to buy the California-based Sequoia Voting Systems, whose voting systems were used across the US. The purchase caught the attention of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which launched an investigation into Smartmatic\u2019s ownership and possible ties to the Venezuelan government. But rather than cooperate with the federal inquiry, Smartmatic quickly sold off Sequoia.\nThe company then turned to Europe and other election markets, moving its headquarters to the UK in 2012. It won a contract worth more than $180m to supply the Philippines with more than 90,000 voting machines for its 2016 elections, with Jarltech International on board to manufacture the machines. But the company became embroiled in more controversy almost immediately after the election when Philippine authorities charged the head of Smartmatic\u2019s technical support team and two subordinates with accessing a system on election night used to transmit unofficial results and making an unauthorized change to code. The case was later dismissed.\nTwo years after the Philippines election, Smartmatic won the Los Angeles contract. Smartmatic hoped to parlay this win to expand across the US. But after its machines were used for the first time in the 2020 presidential primary and general election, Donald Trump, who lost the election, falsely accused Smartmatic and Dominion Voting Systems of manipulating the results to give the election to Joe Biden.\nThese claims were amplified by Fox News and other media outlets sympathetic to Trump, and in 2021, Smartmatic filed a series of defamation lawsuits against media outlets and Trump supporters who they say encouraged and amplified the vote-rigging assertions, including a $2.7bn defamation suit against Fox News. Smartmatic claims Fox News reporting decimated its US business prospects, causing other election jurisdictions to shun it. But Fox News says it simply covered newsworthy claims made by Trump and others.\nLast year Smartmatic settled a similar suit against Newsmax for $40m and against One America News for an undisclosed sum and seemed to be on path to win or settle the Fox News suit as well until the indictment of its executives. Fox News has used the indictments and alleged bribery scheme to support its defense in the defamation suit, saying in court documents that if the company has had trouble expanding its business in the US, it\u2019s due to these allegations and the company\u2019s troubled history, not Fox News reporting.\nThe charges\nProsecutors from the southern district of Florida allege that the three Smartmatic executives and Jarltech owner Andy Wang engaged in a years-long conspiracy to overcharge the Philippines government for voting machines, then used the fraudulently obtained funds to pay more than $1m in kickbacks to Juan Andres Bautista \u2013 chair of the Philippine elections commission at the time \u2013 to win and retain a contract to supply systems for the 2016 elections there.\nJarltech allegedly overcharged the Philippines government $10-$50 per voting machine in \u201cextra\u201d or \u201crush\u201d fees, amassing about $6m in a slush fund to pay the bribes. Wang allegedly managed the funds in Hong Kong bank accounts, and Smartmatic executives directed the payments, using bogus purchasing agreements, shell companies and banks in Europe, Asia and the US. Bautista passed the money to a family member who then bought a condo in San Francisco, prosecutors say.\nWang did not respond to questions from the Guardian.\nThe justice department investigation began after Bautista\u2019s estranged wife told Philippine authorities in 2017 that her husband had $20m in \u201cunexplained wealth\u201d and provided them with 35 passbooks for offshore bank accounts in Bautista\u2019s name. Bautista resigned as chair of the election commission two months later, and in 2023, news broke that the justice department had filed charges against him and was investigating unnamed Smartmatic executives as well.\nBut the scheme didn\u2019t start with the Philippines. Prosecutors say the conspirators had also inflated the cost of voting machines sold to Venezuela to amass $4m for bribes paid to unnamed Venezuelan officials between 2012 and 2014 , showing a pattern of illegal activity. In 2019, prosecutors say Pi\u00f1ate also transferred ownership of an upscale home in Caracas to Tibisay Lucena Ram\u00edrez, then president of the Venezuelan National Electoral Council, to secure her assistance with its business interests in that country.\nA Smartmatic spokesperson calls the house claim \u201cuntethered from reality\u201d. She says Smartmatic \u201cceased all operations in Venezuela in August 2017 after blowing the whistle on the government and has never sought to secure business there again\u201d.\nIn 2017, Smartmatic accused the Venezuelan electoral council and the Nicol\u00e1s Maduro regime of manipulating voter turnout numbers and election results and ceased business in the country. But prosecutors say Pi\u00f1ate hoped to repair the relationship with Venezuela with Ram\u00edrez\u2019s help and gave her the Caracas home as a bribe. Ram\u00edrez died in 2023.\nLos Angeles county\nThe federal case against Smartmatic executives and the company\u2019s lawsuit against Fox News have now become intertwined due to the new allegations about the LA county money and questions about whether the executives used bribes to win favor around the county contract. Fox News says in its recent filing against LA county that it \u201cdoes not yet have evidence that slush fund payments or real estate title transfers were made to any L.A. County official\u201d, but it says that gifts Logan received from the company follow \u201cpatterns of misconduct\u201d that prosecutors have alleged occurred in other countries, and that Logan cultivated an unusually close relationship with Smartmatic executives that went \u201cwell beyond typical business relationships.\u201d\nLogan took a nine-day trip to the Maldives and Taiwan in July 2019 that was partially funded by Smartmatic, including business-class air fare, accommodations and meals, according to text messages obtained by Fox News and included in its court filing. The Maldives portion was covered by an organization that invited Logan to speak there, but Smartmatic paid for Logan\u2019s travel to Taiwan. Based on another text message not included in the court filing but seen by the Guardian, Smartmatic played a role in coordinating the conference invitation to Logan as well.\nLogan\u2019s wife accompanied him on the trip, but the text messages indicate he gave his credit card number to Smartmatic to cover her $5,000 air fare. Logan and his wife tacked on tourist activity to the Taiwan portion of their trip, and it\u2019s not clear how much Smartmatic paid for the entire excursion. Under California Fair Political Practices Commission regulations, gifts to state and local officials from a single source were limited to $500 a year when Logan took the trip. Smartmatic would not say how much it paid for the Taiwan trip, citing ongoing litigation.\nAn LA county spokesperson said in an email that the Taiwan trip was not a gift but a work trip to conduct oversight of the manufacturing process \u2013 the trip included a visit to Jarltech, the subcontractor that was making the hardware for LA county\u2019s machines. The spokesperson wrote: \u201cthe lead from the County\u2019s VSAP design contractor was also part of the trip, which included detailed reviews and presentations of products that required approval prior to manufacturing, and onsite visits to multiple product and manufacturing assembly plants/operations.\u201d\nApproval of the manufacturing process was required as part of the contract, he says, and \u201cprotocols for notification and approval of the travel were followed and are documented in the responsive records provided [to Fox News]\u201d.\nAsked why the project manager for the contract, whose job is \u201cinspecting any and all tasks, deliverables, goods, services, or other work provided by or on behalf of the Contractor\u201d didn\u2019t visit the Jarltech facilities instead of Logan, spokesperson Michael Sanchez said that as chief elections official \u201cLogan had and continues to have clear responsibility for ensuring contract compliance.\u201d\nFox News disputes that the travel was covered under the contract, noting that the contract only mentions paying travel expenses if county officials are auditing financial records related to Smartmatic\u2019s contract with the county and have to travel outside the county to view the company\u2019s financial records. Sanchez says the paragraph addressing travel expenses \u201cis not limited to the inspection of financial records for a financial audit\u201d but includes travel to \u201cexamine \u2026 any pertinent transaction, activity, or record\u201d relating to the contract.\nIn addition to the Taiwan travel, Fox News says Smartmatic paid for an unknown number of meals in upscale restaurants for Logan, at least one of which Logan did not report on annual disclosure form in 2022. In a deposition in the lawsuit Fox has filed against LA county to obtain Logan\u2019s records, Logan disputes that he was required to report the meal because he says it was a personal meal with a Smartmatic employee.\nHe also rejects the suggestion that Smartmatic won its contract out of favoritism.\n\u201cThe contract between Los Angeles County and Smartmatic USA was competitively bid, evaluated, and awarded in compliance with the County\u2019s open competitive public procurement processes,\u201d Logan wrote in an email."
