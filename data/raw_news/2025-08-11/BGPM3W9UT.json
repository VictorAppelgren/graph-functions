They will enable DoorDash to automate complex purchasing decisions, address operational challenges in on-demand delivery and respond more effectively to fluctuations in demand.\n\n\u201cRelex AI-powered tools have transformed how we manage our supply chain,\u201d DoorDash Head of Inventory Eli Bleemer said in the release. \u201cWith this expansion, we can unlock even greater efficiencies, from optimizing inventory to ensuring the freshest products for our consumers.\u201d\n\nRelex\u2019s platform is used by retailers and manufacturers to optimize demand forecasting, replenishment, merchandising, pricing and promotions, supply chain operations and production planning, per the release.\n\nTiina Kanninen, senior vice president of customer success at Relex, said in the release: \u201cOur unified approach to supply chain optimization provides the precision and agility DoorDash needs to continue to scale efficiently, especially in a fast-paced logistics environment.\u201d\n\nFirms need a comprehensive end-to-end solution for the entire consumer goods supply chain that can seamlessly link downstream demand with upstream planning so they can more accurately predict consumer demand, optimize production plans and schedules, adjust inventory levels, and adapt quickly to market changes or unexpected disruptions, Relex co-founder Michael Falck told PYMNTS in an interview posted in January 2024.\n\n\u201cFresh goods demand requires forecasting and optimization because you have uncertainties regarding both the material supply and the demand, which leads to different opportunities in terms of how to use the raw material to meet the customer needs,\u201d Falck said, adding that this leads to \u201cless shrink and waste\u201d across the whole supply chain.\n\nWhen DoorDash deployed Relex\u2019s supply chain planning solution in August 2022, the companies said it would use machine learning to create forecasts to provide supply chain optimization for DashMart locations.\n\nFor all PYMNTS B2B coverage, subscribe to the daily B2B Newsletter.",

      "text": "Only, unlike most physical chains, identifying the weakest link in a complicated supply chain be, well, complicated.\n\u201cMany businesses, for example in retail, that are vertically integrated are facing exactly the same challenges,\u201d Michael Falck, co-founder of RELEX Solutions, tells PYMNTS.\nWhat firms need, Falck explains, is a comprehensive end-to-end solution for the entire consumer goods supply chain, one that can seamlessly link downstream demand with upstream planning, so companies can more accurately predict consumer demand, optimize production plans and schedules, adjust inventory levels, and adjust quickly to market changes or unexpected disruptions.\nFalck highlights the challenges faced by firms in industries like meat and dairy, where uncertainties in both supply and demand require effective supply-demand balancing.\n\u201cFresh goods demand requires forecasting and optimization because you have uncertainties regarding both the material supply and the demand, which leads to different opportunities in terms of how to use the raw material to meet the customer needs,\u201d he explains, adding that this leads to \u201cless shrink and waste\u201d across the whole supply chain.\nOptimizing Supply-Demand Balancing Act\nThe future of the consumer goods supply chain lies in leveraging technology to optimize end-to-end processes, reducing waste, and enhancing sustainability.\nWhile RELEX had been focusing on demand planning and forecasting for retailers for the firm\u2019s entire history, it lacked a comprehensive offering for consumer brands. That\u2019s why, as Falck explained, RELEX acquired Optimity on Jan. 3 to add new capabilities to its retail and supply chain platform and provide a more comprehensive solution for consumer brands.\n\u201cWe talked a lot to [Optimity\u2019s] existing customers during the process and what stood out was how satisfied and happy they were,\u201d he says.\nWhen discussing the role of technology in reshaping the consumer goods value chain, Falck acknowledges that while there are advancements, there is still much work to be done.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of technology that is still working fine, and the main problem isn\u2019t to come up with new ideas \u2014 it\u2019s to start actually getting what already works implemented into workflows. \u2026 The last few years have emphasized the need to have good, adaptable IT solutions in order to cope with sudden changes in demand and identify bottlenecks in the whole supply chain while being able to react to those in a cost-efficient manner,\u201d Falck explains.\n\u201cTraditionally how you look at supply chains was that you needed to either have an adaptive supply chain and process, or you needed to be efficient. Now, it is basically that you need to be do both: You need to be optimized and efficient, and you need to be adaptable; and this applies across the value chain end-to-end,\u201d he adds.\nComplicating matters is the fact that many retailers and consumer brands still operate in a siloed manner, with limited visibility into demand, inventory and planning.\n\u201cTo be really blunt, I would rate the level of digital modernization within the consumer goods value chain as a three or four out of ten,\u201d says Falck. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of technology and innovative solutions just waiting to be implemented.\u201d\nShaping Supply Chain Dynamics\nFalck emphasizes the need for better implementation of existing technology and the utilization of more granular and accurate information to optimize the value chain, explaining that innovation in data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and supply chain optimization tools will play a pivotal role in shaping the industry.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to go all sci-fi to do something that provides huge gains in efficiency, but as the price of computing power goes down, being able to optimize the end-to-end value chain is already possible today,\u201d he says.\nBy leveraging cheaper computing power, companies can optimize the value chain, identify bottlenecks, and react efficiently.\nRegarding the impact of generative AI, Falck mentions that while it is an exciting technology, its application in the supply chain may not be a complete step change from what is already being done, explaining that firms like RELEX were founded to apply machine learning models that can enable customers to be more efficient.\nHowever, he says the potential for AI to democratize solutions and make them more accessible to users with varying levels of expertise, noting that RELEX is launching its own \u201cRELEX GPT that will have all the information about our products and manuals and wiki to help our own employees, our customers, our partners, to utilize our solutions and better integrate that with their own data.\u201d\nLooking ahead, Falck expresses a desire to see more efficiency and sustainability within the industry. He believes that there is a significant opportunity to reduce waste and improve sustainability in the grocery chain and food manufacturing sector, and sees the future of supply chain and retail planning process being even further advanced by the ability to access more accurate and granular data from the entire supply chain.\n\u201cThere\u2019s so much you can do now without having to wait several years for any new technology,\u201d he says."
