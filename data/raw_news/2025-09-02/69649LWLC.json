  "title": "Wall Street tumbles as US stocks fall toward their worst day in a month",
  "description": "Wall Street is tumbling as rising pressure from the bond market pulls U.S. stocks further from their records",
  "content": "Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the world's move into artificial-intelligence technology, fell 3.6% and was the single strongest force pulling the S&P 500 lower. Amazon sank 2.2%, and Alphabet dropped 2.5%.\n\nThe overall stock market felt pressure from rising yields in the bond market, where the 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 4.27% from 4.23% late Friday. When bonds are paying more in interest, investors are less willing to pay high prices for stocks.\n\nLonger-term bond yields are on the rise around the world, in part because of worries about how difficult it will be for governments to repay their growing mountains of debt.\n\nIn the United States, longer-term Treasury yields are feeling added pressure from President Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on the Federal Reserve for not cutting interest rates sooner. The fear is that a less independent Fed will be less likely to make the unpopular decisions needed to keep inflation under control over the long term, such as keeping short-term rates higher than investors would like.\n\nTuesday was also the first opportunity for trading after a federal appeals court ruled late Friday that Trump overstepped his legal authority when announcing sweeping tariffs on almost every country on Earth, though it left the tariffs in place for now.\n\nTariffs have certainly created confusion across the global economy and may have hurt the U.S. job market. But less income from them could also force the U.S. government to borrow more to pay its bills, according to Scott Wren, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\n\nIn another signal of increasing worries in financial markets, the price of gold rose 2% after touching a record. The metal has often provided a haven for investors in times of uncertainty.\n\nTreasury yields briefly trimmed their gains after a report on Tuesday said U.S. manufacturing shrank by more last month than economists expected. Many companies told the Institute for Supply Management that tariffs are continuing to make conditions chaotic.\n\n\u201cToo much uncertainty for us and our customers regarding tariffs and the U.S./global economy,\u201d said one company in the chemical products industry said, while noting that orders across most product lines have weakened.\n\nThe worse-than-expected data on manufacturing could give the Federal Reserve more leeway to cut its main interest rate for the first time this year at its next meeting in a couple of weeks. That's the widespread expectation among traders, though several economic reports coming this week could change things.\n\nThe highlight for the week is coming on Friday, when economists expect a report to show that U.S. employers upped their hiring by a bit last month. Last month's weaker-than-expected jobs report raised worries about the economy and cranked up expectations for coming cuts to rates by the Fed.\n\nOn Wall Street, Constellation Brands tumbled 6.9% after the beer, wine and spirits company warned that it\u2019s seen a slowdown in purchases of its high-end beers, particularly among its Hispanic customers. That pushed it to slash its forecast for profit this fiscal year.\n\nKraft Heinz fell 7% after announcing that it\u2019s splitting into two, a decade after a merger of the brands created one of the biggest food companies on the planet.\n\nOne of the companies will include shelf stable meals and include brands such as Heinz, Philadelphia cream cheese and Kraft Mac & Cheese. The other will include the Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables brands. The official names of the two companies will be released later.\n\nAmong the market\u2019s few gainers was PepsiCo, which rose 2.1% after an investment firm said it sent suggestions to the company\u2019s board to reaccelerate its growth and boost financial performance. The investor, Elliott Management, has a history of buying into companies and then pushing for big changes that can lead to better stock performance.\n\nIn stock markets abroad, indexes slumped across Europe, with Germany\u2019s DAX losing 2.3%. That was after a more mixed finish in Asia, where indexes rose 0.9% in Seoul but fell 0.5% in Hong Kong.",

      "text": "Activist investor takes a $4 billion stake in PepsiCo, seeing a path to revive sales\nActivist investor Elliott Investment Management is taking a $4 billion stake in PepsiCo, saying there\u2019s an opportunity to revive the snack and drinks company.\nYears of double-digit price increases from PepsiCo and changing customer preferences has weakened demand for its drinks and snacks, the company said in February. In July PepsiCo said that it is trying to combat perceptions that its products are too expensive by expanding distribution of value brands like Chester\u2019s and Santitas.\nStubborn inflation has had an impact on consumer behavior and many people have cut back on the discretionary purchases that they make.\nPepsiCo lowered its full-year earnings expectations in April, citing increased costs from tariffs and a pullback in consumer spending. The company reaffirmed that guidance three months later. Its tariff costs have risen since then. In June, the Trump administration hiked the tariff on imported aluminum from 25% to 50%.\nIn a letter to PepsiCo\u2019s board, Elliott said that the company is being hurt by a lack of strategic clarity, decelerating growth and eroding profitability in its North American food and beverage businesses. But the firm still believes in PepsiCo\u2019s potential, particularly noting its growing international business.\n\u201cWhile unfortunate, this disappointing trajectory has created a historic opportunity: With the right mindset and an appropriately ambitious turnaround plan, PepsiCo today represents a rare chance to revitalize a leading global enterprise and unlock significant shareholder value,\u201d Elliott said.\nShares of PepsiCo climbed 2% Tuesday. The stock is down nearly 10% over the past 12 months, according to FactSet, but it is up almost 12% over the past month as Elliott has purchased shares.\nElliott said that it wants to work with PepsiCo\u2019s board and management on ways to improve performance.\n\u201cElliott\u2019s goals at PepsiCo are straightforward: help the company sharpen focus, drive innovation, become more efficient and unlock the value that its leading brands, unmatched scale and world-class employees deserve,\u201d it said. \u201cThe path back to winning is clear and achievable.\u201d\nPepsiCo will review Elliott\u2019s recommendations.\n\u201cPepsiCo maintains an active and productive dialogue with our shareholders and values constructive input on delivering long-term shareholder value,\u201d it said in a statement Tuesday."

      "text": "Kraft Heinz undoes blockbuster merger after a decade of changing tastes\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Kraft Heinz is splitting into two companies a decade after a merger of the brands created one of the biggest food manufacturers on the planet.\nOne of the companies, currently called Global Taste Elevation Co., will include brands such as Heinz, Philadelphia cream cheese and Kraft Mac & Cheese, Kraft Heinz said Tuesday. The other, currently called North American Grocery Co., will include legacy brands like Maxwell House, Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables. The official names of the two companies will be released later.\nKraft Heinz said in May that it was conducting a strategic review of the company, signaling a potential split. It expects the transaction to close in the second half of 2026.\nWhen the company formed in 2015, it wanted to capitalize on its massive scale. But shifting tastes complicated those plans, with households seeking to introduce healthier options at the table.\nKraft Heinz and other food producers have tried to follow those trends. In 2021, Kraft Heinz sold both its Planters nut business and its natural cheese business, vowing to reinvest the money into higher-growth brands like P3 protein snacks and Lunchables. But the company continued to struggle, and Kraft Heinz\u2019s net sales fell 3% in 2024.\n\u201cKraft Heinz\u2019s brands are iconic and beloved, but the complexity of our current structure makes it challenging to allocate capital effectively, prioritize initiatives and drive scale in our most promising areas,\u201d Executive Chair Miguel Patricio said in a statement.\nThe path to the merger of Kraft and Heinz began in 2013, when billionaire investor Warren Buffett teamed up with Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital to buy H.J. Heinz Co. At the time, the $23 billion deal was the most expensive ever in the food industry.\n3G was also behind the formation of Restaurant Brands International \u2014 a merger of Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes \u2014 and Anheuser-Busch InBev. It\u2019s known for strict cost controls and so-called zero-based budgeting, which requires all expenses to be justified each quarter.\nThe deal was intended to help Heinz, which was founded in 1869 in Pittsburgh, expand sales of its condiments and sauces on grocery store shelves. Heinz\u2019s new owners also set about cutting costs, laying off hundreds of workers within months.\nAt the same time Kraft, based in Chicago, sought for a partner after a 2011 split from its snack division, which became Mondelez International.\nIn 2015, Buffett and 3G decided to merge Heinz with Kraft. The merger created the 5th largest food and beverage company in the world, with annual revenue of $28 billion. Buffett and 3G each contributed $5 billion for a special dividend for Kraft shareholders.\nBut the combined company struggled, despite layoffs of thousands of employees and other cost-cutting measures. Even at the time of the merger, many consumers were shifting away from the kinds of highly processed packaged foods that Kraft sells, like Velveeta cheese and Kool-Aid.\nKraft Heinz also had trouble distinguishing its products from cheaper store brands. At Walmart, a 14-ounce bottle of Heinz ketchup costs $2.98; the same size bottle of Walmart\u2019s Great Value brand is 98 cents.\nIn 2019, Kraft Heinz slashed the value of its Oscar Meyer and Kraft brands by $15.4 billion, citing operational costs and supply chain problems. But many investors blamed the company\u2019s leadership, saying its zeal for cost-cutting was hurting brand innovation.\nThe company\u2019s net revenue has fallen every year since 2020, when it saw a pandemic-related bump in sales. In April, Kraft Heinz lowered its full-year sales and earnings guidance, citing weaker customer spending in the U.S. and the impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nBuffett told CNBC Tuesday that he\u2019s disappointed that Kraft Heinz decided to go forwarded with the split, which will likely cost the company $300 million and take a year to complete. And he\u2019s frustrated that shareholders won\u2019t get a vote on this move.\nBuffett said Berkshire\u2019s Greg Abel, who is scheduled to succeed Buffett as CEO next year and served on the Kraft Heinz board for years, told the company about a week ago that Berkshire opposed the move but Kraft Heinz went ahead with it anyway. Berkshire\u2019s two board members resigned in the spring.\nBerkshire has held onto its massive 27% Kraft Heinz stake, making it the company\u2019s largest shareholder, even as stock price fell roughly 70% since the merger. Buffett has acknowledged in the past that Berkshire overpaid for the investment in the first place. Berkshire took a $3.76 billion write-down on the value of its stake in Kraft Heinz in the second quarter.\n\u201cIt certainly didn\u2019t turn out to be a brilliant idea to put them together, but I don\u2019t think taking them apart will fix it,\u201d Buffett said to CNBC. He didn\u2019t immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press Tuesday.\nCarlos Abrams-Rivera will continue to serve as CEO of Kraft Heinz and will become CEO of North American Grocery Co. once the separation is complete. Kraft Heinz said that its board is working with an executive search firm to identify potential CEO candidates for Global Taste Elevation Co.\nKraft Heinz has no plans to change its current headquarter locations in Chicago and Pittsburgh.\nThe announcement follows the recent breakups of other big food companies. Late last month, Keurig Dr Pepper said it would buy the owner of Peet\u2019s Coffee and then split itself in two, with one company selling coffee and the other selling cold beverages like Snapple, Dr Pepper, 7UP and energy drinks. Keurig and Dr Pepper merged in 2018.\nIn 2023, Kellogg Co. also split into two companies. Mars bought one of the companies, dubbed Kellanova, which owned snack brands like Pringles. Italian confectioner Ferrero announced in July that it planned to buy WK Kellogg, the cereal company.\nKraft Heinz shares fell 3% Tuesday.\n___\nDurbin reported from Detroit.

      "text": "Modelo seller Constellation Brands lowers sales forecast as US consumers buy less beer\nConstellation Brands, which owns the Modelo and Corona beers in the U.S., lowered its full-year sales and profit outlook Tuesday, citing falling demand among Hispanic customers in particular.\nConstellation President and CEO Bill Newlands said U.S. purchases of high-end beers have declined over the past few months. Consumers are making fewer trips to buy beer and are spending less per trip, Newlands said.\nThe trend is most pronounced among Hispanic consumers, Newlands said. The company said in a recent conference call with investors that Hispanic buyers account for about half of Constellation\u2019s business.\nSo far this year, Modelo Especial is the top-selling beer brand by dollar sales at U.S. retail stores, according to NIQ data compiled by Bump Williams Consulting. Modelo overtook Bud Light in 2023 after Bud Light was criticized for sending a commemorative can to a transgender influencer.\nConstellation has been licensed to sell Modelo and Corona in the U.S. since 2013 as part of an agreement with antitrust regulators after Bud Light parent AB InBev bought Mexico\u2019s Grupo Modelo. Constellation also owns wine brands like Robert Mondavi and Kim Crawford, and spirits like Casa Noble tequila.\nConstellation warned in April that Hispanic consumers were under pressure. At the time, Newlands said research indicated two-thirds of Hispanic buyers were concerned about higher prices on food and other essentials and half were concerned about immigration issues. Many were also worried about the job market, he said.\n\u201cThat has tended to mean that the consumer has pulled back on spending on a number of categories,\u201d Newlands said during a conference call with investors. \u201cBeer is quite a ways down the list, but it\u2019s certainly on the list because things like social gatherings, an area where the Hispanic consumer often consumes beer, are declining today as part of these overarching concerns that they have.\u201d\nRochester, New York-based Constellation said Tuesday it now expects its net sales of beer to fall between 2% and 4% in its 2026 fiscal year, compared to its previous forecast of up to a 3% increase. Constellation\u2019s fiscal year ends Feb. 28, 2006.\nThe company also expects adjusted earnings per share of $11.30 to $11.60 for the year, compared to its previous forecast of $12.60 to $12.90.\nConstellation\u2019s shares fell more than 6% in afternoon trading Tuesday."

      "text": "Court finds Trump\u2019s tariffs an illegal use of emergency power, but leaves them in place for now\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A federal appeals court ruled Friday that President Donald Trump had no legal right to impose sweeping tariffs on almost every country on earth but left in place for now his effort to build a protectionist wall around the American economy.\nThe ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found Trump overstepped his authority under an emergency powers law, a major legal blow that largely upheld a May decision by a specialized federal trade court in New York.\n\u201cIt seems unlikely that Congress intended to \u2026 grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\u201d the judges wrote in a 7-4 ruling.\nBut they did not strike down the tariffs immediately, allowing his administration until mid-October to appeal to the Supreme Court.\nThe president vowed to do just that. \u201cIf allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media platform.\nWhite House spokesman Kush Desai said Trump had acted lawfully, and \u201cwe look forward to ultimate victory on this matter.\u201d\nAn attorney for small businesses affected by the tariffs, meanwhile, said the ruling shows Trump doesn\u2019t have unlimited power to impose tariffs on his own. \u201cThis decision protects American businesses and consumers from the uncertainty and harm caused by these unlawful tariffs,\u201d said Jeffrey Schwab, director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center.\nStill, it remains unclear whether businesses will see any effects from the decision, said National Foreign Trade Council President Jake Colvin.\n\u201cIf these tariffs are ultimately struck down, it ought to serve as a wake up call for Congress to reclaim its constitutional mandate to regulate duties and bring some long-term certainty for U.S. businesses and relief for consumers,\u201d Colvin said.\nDemocratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said he plans to force votes on \u201crepealing these harmful, regressive taxes at every opportunity.\u201d\nPutting pressure on allies\nThe ruling complicates Trump\u2019s ambitions to upend decades of American trade policy completely on his own. Trump has alternative laws for imposing import taxes, but they would limit the speed and severity with which he could act. His tariffs \u2014 and the erratic way he\u2019s rolled them out \u2014 have shaken global markets, alienated U.S. trading partners and allies and raised fears of higher prices and slower economic growth.\nBut he\u2019s also used the levies to pressure the European Union, Japan and other countries into accepting one-sided trade deals and to bring tens of billions of dollars into the federal Treasury to help pay for the massive tax cuts he signed into law July 4.\n\u201cThe administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy,\u201d Ashley Akers, senior counsel at the Holland & Knight law firm and a former Justice Department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court decision.\nA dissent from the judges who disagreed with Friday\u2019s ruling clears a possible legal path for Trump, concluding that the 1977 law allowing for emergency actions \u201cis not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority under the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions,\u201d which have allowed the legislature to grant some tariff authorities to the president.\nThe government has argued that if the tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it\u2019s collected, delivering a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury.\nRevenue from tariffs now totals $159 billion, more than double what it was at the same point the year before. Indeed, the Justice Department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could mean \u201cfinancial ruin\u201d for the United States.\n\u201cFor all the tariffs that have been collected under IEEPA, you\u2019re going to see folks request refunds and more refunds,\u201d said trade attorney Ryan Majerus, a partner at King & Spalding and a former White House economic adviser.\nAttorney General Pam Bondi, meanwhile, accused the judges of interfering with the president\u2019s central role in foreign policy and vowed to appeal.\nWhat tariffs are in question\nThe ruling involves two sets of import taxes, both of which Trump justified by declaring a national emergency under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA):\n\u2014 The sweeping tariffs he announced April 2 \u2014 \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d he called it \u2014 when he imposed \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs of up to 50% on countries with which the United States runs trade deficits and a \u201cbaseline\u201d 10% tariff on just about everyone else. Those tariff rates have since been revised by Trump, in some cases after trade negotiations, and generally went into effect Aug. 7.\nThe national emergency underlying the tariffs, Trump said, was the long-running gap between what the U.S. sells and what it buys from the rest of the world. The president started to levy modified tariff rates in August, but goods from countries with which the U.S. runs a surplus also face the taxes.\n\u2014 The \u201ctrafficking tariffs\u201d he announced Feb. 1 on imports from Canada, China and Mexico and later refined. These were designed to get those countries to do more to stop what he declared a national emergency: the illegal flow of drugs and immigrants across their borders into the United States. The Constitution gives Congress the power to impose taxes, including tariffs. But over the decades, lawmakers have ceded authority to the president, and Trump has made the most of the power vacuum.\nBut Trump\u2019s assertion that IEEPA essentially gives him unlimited power to tax imports quickly drew legal challenges \u2014 at least seven cases. No president had ever used the law to justify tariffs, though IEEPA had been used frequently to impose export restrictions and other sanctions on U.S. adversaries such as Iran and North Korea.\nThe plaintiffs argued that the emergency power law does not authorize the use of tariffs.\nThey also noted that the trade deficit hardly meets the definition of an \u201cunusual and extraordinary\u201d threat that would justify declaring an emergency under the law. The United States, after all, has run trade deficits \u2014 in which it buys more from foreign countries than it sells them \u2014 for 49 straight years and in good times and bad.\nEmergency powers\nThe Trump administration argued that courts approved President Richard Nixon\u2019s emergency use of tariffs in a 1971 economic crisis that arose from the chaos that followed his decision to end a policy linking the U.S. dollar to the price of gold. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With the Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language used in IEEPA.\nIn May, the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York rejected the argument, ruling that Trump\u2019s Liberation Day tariffs \u201cexceed any authority granted to the President\u201d under the emergency powers law. In reaching its decision, the trade court combined two challenges \u2014 one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states \u2014 into a single case.\nIn the case of the drug trafficking and immigration tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico, the trade court ruled that the levies did not meet IEEPA\u2019s requirement that they \u201cdeal with\u201d the problem they were supposed to address.\nThe court challenge does not cover other Trump tariffs, including levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos that the president imposed after Commerce Department investigations concluded that those imports were threats to U.S. national security.\nNor does it include tariffs that Trump imposed on China in his first term \u2014 and President Joe Biden kept \u2014 after a government investigation concluded that the Chinese used unfair practices to give their own technology firms an edge over rivals from the United States and other Western countries.\nTrump could potentially cite alternative authorities to impose import taxes, though they are more limited. Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, for instance, allows the president to tax imports from countries with which the U.S. runs big trade deficits at 15% for 150 days.\nLikewise, Section 301 of the same 1974 law allows the president to tax imports from countries found to have engaged in unfair trade practices after an investigation by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Trump used Section 301 authority to launch his first-term trade war with China.\n___\nAssociated Press writers Mark Sherman and Josh Boak contributed to this story."

      "text": "Key US inflation gauge holds mostly steady though core inflation ticks higher\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge mostly held steady last month despite President Donald Trump\u2019s broad-based tariffs, but a measure of underlying inflation increased.\nPrices rose 2.6% in July compared with a year ago, the Commerce Department said Friday, the same annual increase as in June. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, prices rose 2.9% from a year earlier, up from 2.8% in the previous month and the highest since February.\nThe figures illustrate why many officials at the Federal Reserve have been reluctant to cut their key interest rate. While inflation is much lower than the roughly 7% peak it reached three years ago, it is still running noticeably above the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\nAt the same time, the report showed that consumer spending picked up last month and could boost economic growth, which weakened considerably in the first six months of the year.\nOn a monthly basis, consumer prices rose 0.2% from June to July, down from 0.3% the previous month, while core prices increased 0.3% for the second month in a row.\nThe figures are similar to those reported earlier this month in the more widely-followed consumer price index, which has risen 2.7% from a year ago. The core CPI increased 3.1% in July compared with a year earlier.\nSeparately, the Friday report showed that consumer spending jumped 0.5% in July, the biggest increase since March and a sign that many Americans are still willing to open their wallets despite high interest rates and uncertainty surrounding the direction of the economy. Spending jumped sharply for long-lasting goods such as cars, appliances and furniture, many of which are imported.\nIncomes rose 0.4% from June to July, boosted by a healthy gain in wages and salaries, the report showed.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has said the central bank will likely cut its key rate at its meeting next month. But policymakers are expected to proceed cautiously and it\u2019s not clear how many more rate cuts will happen this year.\nWhen the Fed reduces its key rate, it often \u2014 though not always \u2014 lowers borrowing costs for things like mortgages, car loans, and business borrowing.\nTrump has relentlessly pushed Powell and the Fed for lower interest rates since earlier this year, calling Powell \u201cToo Late\u201d and a \u201cmoron\u201d and arguing that there is \u201cno inflation.\u201d On Monday he sought to fire Lisa Cook, a member of the Fed\u2019s governing board in an effort to gain greater control over the central bank."

It was the first time in the Fed\u2019s 112-year history that a president has tried to fire a governor.\nTrump said he was doing so because of allegations raised by one of his appointees that she has committed mortgage fraud.\nCook has argued in a lawsuit seeking to block her firing that the claims are a pretext for Trump\u2019s true goal: Gaining more control over the Fed. A court may decide next week whether to temporarily block Cook\u2019s firing while the case makes its way through the legal process.\nCook is accused of claiming two homes as primary residences in July 2021, before she joined the board, which could have led to a lower mortgage rate than if one had been classified as a second home or an investment property. She has suggested in her lawsuit that it may have been a clerical error but hasn\u2019t directly responded to the accusations.\nFed independence \u2018hangs by a thread\u2019\nTrump and members of his administration have made no secret about their desire to exert more control over the Fed. Trump has repeatedly demanded that the central bank cut its key rate to as low as 1.3%, from its current level of 4.3%.\nBefore trying to fire Cook, Trump repeatedly attacked the Fed\u2019s chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting the short-term interest rate and threatened to fire him as well.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a majority very shortly, so that\u2019ll be good,\u201d Trump said Tuesday, a reference to the fact that if he is able to replace Cook, his appointees will control the Fed\u2019s board by a 4-3 vote.\n\u201cThe particular case of Governor Cook is not as important as what this latest move shows about the escalation in the assaults on the Fed,\u201d said Jon Faust, an economist at Johns Hopkins and former adviser to Powell. \u201cIn my view, Fed independence really now hangs by a thread.\u201d\nSome economists do think the Fed should cut more quickly, though virtually none agree with Trump that it should do so by 3 percentage points. Powell has signaled the Fed is likely to cut by a quarter point in September.\nWhy economists prefer independent central banks\nThe Fed wields extensive power over the U.S. economy. By cutting the short-term interest rate it controls \u2014 which it typically does when the economy falters \u2014 the Fed can make borrowing cheaper and encourage more spending, growth, and hiring. When it raises the rate to combat the higher prices that come with inflation, it can weaken the economy and cause job losses.\nMost economists have long preferred independent central banks because they can take unpopular steps that elected officials are more likely to avoid. Economic research has shown that nations with independent central banks typically have lower inflation over time.\nElected officials like Trump, however, have much greater incentives to push for lower interest rates, which make it easier for Americans to buy homes and cars and would boost the economy in the short run.\nA political Fed could boost inflation\nDouglas Elmendorf, an economist at Harvard and former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, said that Trump\u2019s demand for the Fed to cut its key rate by 3 percentage points would overstimulate the economy, lifting consumer demand above what the economy can produce and boosting inflation \u2014 similar to what happened during the pandemic.\n\u201cIf the Federal Reserve falls under control of the president, then we\u2019ll end up with higher inflation in this country probably for years to come,\u201d Elmendorf said.\nAnd while the Fed controls a short-term rate, financial markets determine longer-term borrowing costs for mortgages and other loans. And if investors worry that inflation will stay high, they will demand higher yields on government bonds, pushing up borrowing costs across the economy.\nIn Turkey, for example, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan forced the central bank to keep interest rates low in the early 2020s, even as inflation spiked to 85%. In 2023, Erdogan allowed the central bank more independence, which has helped bring down inflation, but short-term interest rates rose to 50% to fight inflation, and are still 46%.\nOther U.S. presidents have badgered the Fed. President Lyndon Johnson harassed then-Fed Chair William McChesney Martin in the mid-1960s to keep rates low as Johnson ramped up government spending on the Vietnam War and antipoverty programs. And Richard Nixon pressured then-Chair Arthur Burns to avoid rate hikes in the run-up to the 1972 election. Both episodes are widely blamed for leading to the stubbornly high inflation of the 1960s and \u201870s.\nTrump has also argued that the Fed should lower its rate to make it easier for the federal government to finance its tremendous $37 trillion debt load. Yet that threatens to distract the Fed from its congressional mandates of keeping inflation and unemployment low.\nIndependence vs accountability\nPresidents do have some influence over the Fed through their ability to appoint members of the board, subject to Senate approval. But the Fed was created to be insulated from short-term political pressures. Fed governors are appointed to staggered, 14-year terms to ensure that no single president can appoint too many.\nJane Manners, a law professor at Fordham University, said there is a reason that Congress decided to create independent agencies like the Fed: They preferred \u201cdecisions that are made from a kind of objective, neutral vantage point grounded in expertise rather than decisions are that are wholly subject to political pressure.\u201d\nYet some Trump administration officials say they want more democratic accountability at the Fed.\nIn an interview with USA Today Vice President JD Vance said, \u201cWhat people who are saying the president has no authority here are effectively saying is that seven economists and lawyers should be able to make an incredibly critical decision for the American people with no democratic input.\u201d\nAnd Stephen Miran, a top White House economic adviser, wrote a paper last year advocating for a restructuring of the Fed, including making it much easier for a president to fire governors.\nThe \u201coverall goal of this design is delivering the economic benefits\u201d of an independent central bank, Miran wrote, \u201cwhile maintaining a level of accountability that a democratic society must demand.\u201d Trump has nominated Miran to the Fed\u2019s board to replace Adriana Kugler, who stepped down unexpectedly Aug. 1.\nThere could be more turmoil ahead\nTrump has personally insulted Powell for months, but his administration now appears much more focused on the Fed\u2019s broader structure.\nThe Fed makes its interest rate decisions through a committee that consists of the seven governors, including Powell, as well as the 12 presidents of regional Fed banks in cities such as New York, Kansas City, and Atlanta. Five of those presidents vote on rates at each meeting. The New York Fed president has a permanent vote, while four others vote on a rotating basis.\nWhile the reserve banks\u2019 boards choose their presidents, the Fed board in Washington can vote to reject them. All 12 presidents will need to be reappointed and approved by the board in February, which could become more contentious if the board votes down one or more of the 12 presidents.\n\u201cThe nuclear scenario is ... the reappointment of the reserve bank presidents and interfering with that, (which) would be the signal that things are truly going off the rails,\u201d said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics."

      "text": "Buffett puts money in ketchup, buys Heinz for $23B\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Billionaire Warren Buffett, the most closely watched investor in America, is putting his money in ketchup, agreeing Thursday to buy H.J. Heinz Co. for $23.3 billion in the richest deal ever in the food industry.\nFor his money, the Oracle of Omaha gets one of the nation\u2019s oldest and most familiar brands, one that\u2019s in refrigerators and kitchen cupboards all over the U.S.\nThe deal is intended to help Heinz accelerate its expansion from a dominant American name into a presence on grocery shelves worldwide. The Pittsburgh-based company also makes baked beans, pickles, vinegar, Classico pasta sauces and Ore-Ida potatoes, as well as a growing stable of sauces suited to regional tastes around the world.\nBuffett\u2019s investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway, is teaming with another firm, 3G Capital, to snap up Heinz, which had long been a subject of takeover speculation. New York-based 3G is best known for its acquisition of Burger King and its role in the deal that created Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world\u2019s biggest beer maker.\nThe deal, expected to close in the third quarter, sent shares of Heinz soaring. The company\u2019s stock price was up nearly 20 percent, closing at $72.50 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.\nBerkshire picked up steam, too. Its Class A shares gained $1,490, or about 1 percent, to close at $149,240.\nBerkshire remains the most expensive U.S. stock but it\u2019s still below its all-time high of $151,650, reached in December 2007. That came before the financial turmoil of 2008 and just after an exceptionally profitable quarter that was helped by a $2 billion investment gain.\nThe plans to take Heinz private apparently began to take shape on a plane in early December. In an interview with CNBC, Buffett said he was approached at that time by Jorge Lemann, a fellow billionaire and a co-founder of 3G. The two had known each other since serving on the board of Gillette about 12 years ago.\nSoon after that encounter, two of 3G\u2019s managing partners traveled to Pittsburgh to have lunch with Heinz CEO William Johnson and raise the prospect of buying the 144-year-old company.\n\u201cThe offer was such that I simply felt compelled to take it to my board,\u201d Johnson said at a news conference Thursday.\nOver the next several weeks, Johnson said, the board worked out details of the transaction.\nBerkshire is putting up $12.12 billion in return for half of the equity in Heinz, as well as $8 billion of preferred shares that pay 9 percent, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 3G Capital will run Heinz, and Berkshire will be the financing partner.\nBy taking the company private, Johnson said, Heinz will have the flexibility to react more quickly without the pressure of satisfying investors with quarterly earnings reports. The company\u2019s push to go global began more than a decade ago, and about two-thirds of its revenue already comes from outside the U.S.\nHeinz is increasingly focusing on emerging markets, where it expects to get about a quarter of its sales this year. Like other packaged food companies, it is betting that staking an early claim in countries with multiplying ranks of middle-class customers will secure its own future.\nAlthough ketchup and sauces still account for just under half its sales, Heinz has expanded over the years to include a much broader array of products across 200 countries, including ABC soy sauce in Indonesia, Quero tomato sauces and vegetables in Brazil and Complan nutritional drinks in India. In 2010, the company bought Foodstar, which makes Master brand soy sauce and fermented bean curd in China.\nThe business reaches back to 1869, when Henry John Heinz and neighbor L. Clarence Noble began selling grated horseradish, bottled in a clear glass to showcase its purity. It wasn\u2019t until 1876 that the company introduced its flagship product, the country\u2019s first commercial ketchup.\nHeinz didn\u2019t become a public company until years later, in 1946.\nHeinz is a prize because it has the type of name recognition that takes years to build, said Brian Sozzi, chief equities analyst for NBG Productions. One testament to the strength of the brand has been the company\u2019s ability to raise prices even in competitive markets, he said.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t going to be another Heinz brand,\u201d Sozzi said.\nJohnson stressed that Heinz would remain in its native Pittsburgh as a condition of the agreement with 3G and Berkshire Hathaway. The only change will be when Heinz no longer appears in stock listings.\nAlthough 3G Capital has a record of aggressively cutting costs at businesses it acquires, managing partner Alex Behring said Heinz is different because the business is healthy and sales are rising. But that wasn\u2019t a guarantee that jobs won\u2019t be cut.\nThe company earned $923.2 million on revenue of $11.65 billion in its last fiscal year.\nThe more Heinz is able to grow, the \u201csafer people will be,\u201d said Johnson, who has been CEO for 15 years.\nAs for management changes, including his own tenure, Johnson said there have not yet been any discussions.\nBuffett did not immediately respond to a message Thursday from The Associated Press. He has recently said that he\u2019s been hunting for elephant-sized deals. At the end of last year, he told CNBC that he had about $47 billion in cash available.\nBerkshire\u2019s biggest acquisition ever was its $26.3 billion purchase of BNSF railroad in 2010.\nLast year, Buffett started building a newspaper company with the $149 million acquisition of 63 Media General newspapers and several other small or mid-sized newspapers. Berkshire also bought the Prudential and Real Living real-estate franchises nationwide last fall.\nThe Heinz deal and the American Airlines-US Airways merger add to an already strong start for merger activity this year. Global merger activity has been tepid since 2007, when $4.6 trillion in deals were announced, according to Dealogic. Last year\u2019s total was $2.7 trillion.\nThe deal is a departure for Berkshire Hathaway. Generally, Buffett prefers to buy entire companies and then allow the businesses to continue operating much the way they did before. Berkshire has also helped finance deals before \u2014 most recently during the financial crisis of 2008, when he made lucrative deals for Berkshire when few other companies had cash.\nHeinz shareholders will receive $72.50 in cash for each share of common stock they own. Based on Heinz\u2019s number of shares outstanding, the deal is worth $23.3 billion excluding debt. Including debt, it\u2019s worth about $28 billion.\nThe price for the deal represents a 20 percent premium over Heinz\u2019s closing price of $60.48 on Wednesday. Heinz said the deal was unanimously approved by its board.\n\u201cIt\u2019s our kind of company,\u201d Buffett said in the CNBC interview, noting that Heinz\u2019s signature ketchup has been around for more than a century. \u201cI\u2019ve sampled it many times.\u201d\n___\nFunk reported from Omaha, Neb.

What\u2019s behind the demand for its 1-ounce gold bars?\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Looking for something to add to your Costco cart along with the 30 rolls of toilet paper? How about a bar of gold?\nWhile not a typical outlet for the sale of precious metals, the members-only warehouse chain has seen its 1-ounce gold bars sell out faster than discounted 170-ounce jugs of laundry detergent.\nIn a company earnings call last week, CFO Richard Galanti said the gold bars, sold exclusively online, are \u201ctypically gone within a few hours\u201d of appearing on Costco\u2019s website \u2014 adding that there\u2019s a two-bar limit per member. As of Wednesday, they remained sold out.\nUnlike some other discount finds at the retail giant, gold bars come with hefty price tag. No prices were listed Wednesday because of the bars\u2019 unavailability, but multiple media outlets reported last week that the 1-ounce gold pieces \u2014 offered in two designs \u2014 were selling for just below $2,000 each.\nThat\u2019s slightly higher than the current market price of gold, which stood at about $1,835 per ounce Wednesday afternoon.\nCostco did not specify how many gold bars have been sold recently, or how often it restocks them. The chain based in Issaquah, Washington, did not immediately respond to The Associated Press\u2019 request for comment Wednesday.\nChances are, interest around Costco\u2019s gold bars isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. Although one or two ounces of gold won\u2019t have a huge impact on diversifying one\u2019s investment portfolio, experts note that there\u2019s been increasing investor demand for precious metals in recent years, and that\u2019s likely to continue.\nStill, it\u2019s important to pause and evaluate investment prospects. Here\u2019s what some experts say.\nWhat\u2019s behind the demand for gold?\nInterest in buying gold often stems from feelings of uncertainty, experts say.\nJonathan Rose, CEO of precious metal broker Genesis Gold Group, says that recent bank failures, inflation and individuals\u2019 concerns about the U.S. dollar, for example, can cause some to start looking for alternative places to park their money.\n\u201cIf someone\u2019s going out to buy gold, that means they think that there\u2019s some type of instability at the structural level of the market and/or the government itself,\u201d added David Wagner III, head of markets and equities at Aptus Capital Advisors.\nIs gold worth the investment?\nRose and others say gold can diversify and balance your investment portfolio, as well as mitigate potential risks down the road.\n\u201cPeople are looking for a safe haven ... to protect their wealth. And gold kind of ticks all those boxes,\u201d Rose said. He added that people may see value in having something tangible \u2014 and put precious metals \u201cin a safety deposit box or into a retirement plan, even like an IRA or 401k ... to safeguard what they have whilst they see what\u2019s happening in the market.\u201d\nBut not everyone agrees. Wagner says gold is \u201cone of the worst things that you can ever own.\u201d Among the downsides, he argues, is that gold isn\u2019t the inflationary hedge many say it is, with inflation at times outpacing gold in recent decades, and that \u201cthere are more efficient ways to protect against the loss of capital,\u201d such as through derivative-based investments.\nThe Commodity Futures Trade Commission has also warned people to be wary of investing in gold. Precious metals can be highly volatile, the commission said, and prices rise as demand goes up \u2014 meaning \u201cwhen economic anxiety or instability is high, the people who typically profit from precious metals are the sellers.\u201d\nIf you do choose to invest in gold, the commission and others add, it\u2019s important to educate yourself on safe trading practices and be cautious of potential scams and counterfeits on the market.\nGold for December delivery fell $6.70 to $1,834.80 an ounce by market close Wednesday. For other precious metals, silver for December delivery fell 23 cents to $21.15 an ounce and December copper fell 3 cents to $3.59 a pound."
