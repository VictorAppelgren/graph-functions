      "feedback": "Your draft is on the right track but needs tightening to meet Argos standards. 1) **Canonical mapping** – explicitly state “spx (+0.5‑1 %)” with a clear sign and magnitude. 2) **Catalyst windows** – list the exact dates: *July 2025 GDP on blockchain (release ≈ July 2025)*, *Kraken/Robinhood tokenization launch (June 30 – July 2 2025)*, *stablecoin fragmentation persists (ongoing, but flag any fee spikes in Q3 2025)*. 3) **Scenario structure** – break the analysis into Base‑Case, 1‑Alt, 2‑Alt, and Risk‑Case, each with a concise headline, magnitude, and horizon. 4) **Watch signals** – add concrete, dated metrics: (a) tokenized trade volume > $X bn by end‑Q3 2025, (b) stablecoin cross‑border fee > Y % by Q4 2025, (c) GDP revision > Z % when blockchain‑published data is released. 5) **Invalidations** – list regulatory triggers with dates (e.g., SEC clamp‑down announcement in Q2 2025). 6) **Citations** – insert inline (ID) citations after each claim (e.g., “(XQMF22EFB)”). 7) **Remove drift** – any sentence not directly tied to spx or a catalyst must be linked or deleted. 8) **Quantify** – replace vague “tightening data integrity” with a specific effect on the equity risk premium (e.g., “reduces the equity risk premium by 0.3‑0.5 %”). 9) **Formatting** – use bullet‑pointed scenario map and watch‑list for clarity. Apply these edits to achieve a concise, defensible, and fully cited Argos‑style briefing.",
