  "content": "MADRID (AP) \u2014 The Spanish league begins with the top teams arriving with different expectations.\n\nDefending champion Barcelona wants to keep its momentum and show it will be the team to beat again in Spain. Real Madrid is aiming to reset after a lackluster last season and with the arrival of coach Xabi Alonso. Atletico Madrid hopes a revamped squad will help keep pace with its rivals.\n\nHere\u2019s what to know about the upcoming season:\n\nBarcelona is coming off one of its best seasons in years, having won the league, the Copa del Rey and the Spanish Super Cup. It also went deep in the Champions League, reaching the semifinals for the first time since 2019.\n\nIn its second year under coach Hansi Flick, the Catalan club will try to add to its success from last season by boosting its squad with English forward Marcus Rashford, who will be teaming up with Lamine Yamal and Robert Lewandowski in an attacking front that was one of the best in Europe last season. It led the scoring charts both in the Spanish league \u2013 with more than 100 goals \u2013 and in the Champions League.\n\nLeaving the team are veteran defender I\u00f1igo Mart\u00ednez, who has signed with Saudi club Al-Nassr, and Ansu Fati, who went on loan with Monaco after not playing much last season. The club also added former Espanyol goalkeeper Joan Garc\u00eda.\n\nBarcelona will make its open its season at Mallorca on Saturday.\n\nMadrid is coming off a disappointing season by its high standards, losing the Spanish league title to Barcelona and failing to reach the final in the Club World Cup and the Champions League. It also lost all four \u201cclasico\u201d matches it played against its Catalan rival.\n\nIt all led to a coaching change, with Carlo Ancelotti taking over the Brazil job and former player Alonso arriving as widely expected.\n\nThe coach couldn\u2019t do much to help Madrid at the Club World Cup, with the team losing to Paris Saint-Germain in the semifinals.\n\nThe attack will again be led by Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior, but the defense \u2013 which struggled last season because of a series of injuries -- was boosted by the signing of young Spain central defender Dean Huijsen and right back Trent Alexander-Arnold, who is joining English countryman Jude Bellingham.\n\nLuka Modric left to join AC Milan after more than a decade with the Spanish club. Lucas Vazquez also departed, and there were still doubts about whether Rodrygo would return.\n\nMadrid\u2019s first match is at home against Osasuna on Aug. 19.\n\nAtletico Madrid had great expectations last season, but it couldn\u2019t make a run for the Spanish league title \u2013 finishing behind Barcelona and Madrid -- and again was eliminated by the city rival in the Champions League.\n\nCoach Diego Simeone shook up the squad in the offseason, with the departures of players such as \u00c1ngel Correa, Rodrigo de Paul, Axel Witsel, Rodrigo Riquelme and C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta. Among those arriving are \u00c1lex Baena, Johnny Cardoso, Thiago Almada, Giacomo Raspadori, Matteo Ruggeri, Marc Pubill and D\u00e1vid Hancko.\n\nThe team will still be led up front by Antoine Griezmann and Juli\u00e1n Alvarez.\n\nAtletico kicks off at Espanyol on Sunday.\n\nThe teams that made good runs last season and will try to stay near the top again include Athletic Bilbao, Villarreal and Real Betis. Levante, Elche and Oviedo were the teams promoted this season, replacing demoted Leganes, Las Palmas and Valladolid.\n\nBarcelona and Real Madrid are among the teams that won\u2019t be at full strength to begin the season. The Catalan club starts without veteran goalkeeper Marc-Andr\u00e9 Ter Stegen because of surgery for lower back problems. The goalkeeper was at odds with the club about his recovery time. He was provisionally stripped of his captaincy for refusing to sign a medical report about the injury, but he and the club eventually reached an agreement that restored his role as captain.\n\nVeteran striker Robert Lewandowski also wasn\u2019t expected to play early on because of a muscle issue.\n\nMadrid won\u2019t have Bellingham for the first few rounds after undergoing surgery to address a recurrent dislocation of his left shoulder.\n\nReal Betis playmaker Isco is expected to miss the first few months of the season after fracturing his leg in a friendly against Malaga.",

Here good players can enjoy the game ,and I really love football,\u201d Rashford said. \u201cI am looking forward to helping and I want to win trophies. One of the reasons I came is that motivation and the ambition to be a better player.\u201d\nRashford had arrived in Barcelona on Sunday to sign his contract. He had already met his teammates and reportedly trained with the group on Tuesday.\n\u201cI am really grateful for the welcome that the fans have given me and I can\u2019t wait to make my debut in the jersey,\u201d said Rashford, who will wear the No. 14 jersey with the Catalan club.\nFinancial details were not immediately disclosed. Spanish media said the agreement with United would give Barcelona an option to buy Rashford for about 30 million euros ($35 million).\nSpanish champion Barcelona had looked set to sign Spain forward Nico Williams this offseason until he agreed a 10-year deal to stay at Athletic Bilbao earlier this month. That opened the door for Rashford to make the switch.\nPotent attack\nBarcelona had the best attack in Spanish soccer and one of the most prolific across Europe last season, but had been trying to add another piece to the front line to go along with Yamal, Raphinha and Lewandowski.\nThe trio helped the club score 102 goals as it won the Spanish league title, 24 goals more than runner-up Real Madrid. The Catalan club also led the Champions League in goals with 43, five more than champion Paris Saint-Germain, before being eliminated by Inter Milan in the semifinals.\nRashford is the third signing for the Barcelona squad coached by Hansi Flick ahead of the new season. The club had added goalkeeper Joan Garc\u00eda from city rival Espanyol and winger Roony Bardghji from Copenhagen.\nBarcelona was optimistic it will be able to register the new players despite struggling to meet financial fair play rules in recent years. Last season, it was in danger of not being able to register Dani Olmo because of salary-cap rules. The club already made some cap room for next season thanks to the departure of Pablo Torre, Ansu Fati and Clement Lenglet.\nWhat went wrong at United?\nRashford had progressed through United\u2019s famed academy that produced greats like Ryan Giggs and David Beckham. He made 429 appearances, scored 138 goals and helped United win five major trophies, including two FA Cups and the Europa League.\nBut he struggled to consistently live up to the hype that surrounded him when he burst onto the scene as a teenager in 2016 \u2014 only managing 20 goals or more in three seasons. In his last two seasons at United he scored a combined 15 goals and added another four in 17 games on loan at Villa.\nBut Rashford\u2019s ability has rarely been called into question and he recently earned a recall to the England squad under new coach Thomas Tuchel, putting him in contention for next year\u2019s World Cup.\n___\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer"

That allowed Madrid to count on the defender to play for Alonso\u2019s team at the Club World Cup in the United States.\nMadrid opens its Club World Cup group-stage campaign against Saudi club Al-Hilal next Wednesday at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.\nAlexander-Arnold was accompanied by his parents and relatives in the capital. After signing the contract alongside Real Madrid president Florentino P\u00e9rez, he was introduced with a video of his highlights and then spoke briefly, in Spanish.\n\u201cThank you for this opportunity,\u201d he said. \u201cTo sign with a club like Real Madrid doesn\u2019t happen very often. It\u2019s a dream come true. I\u2019m very happy and proud to be here. I\u2019m very excited to show my game to Madrid fans but I\u2019m aware that it\u2019s a great responsibility to play for Real Madrid. I\u2019m ready to give my all for this team and for the fans.\u201d\nA long-time Madrid admirer\nAlexander-Arnold was born in Liverpool and grew up as a Liverpool fan but \u201calways admired the (Real Madrid) players and the club.\u201d\n\u201cWhether you support the club or not, you have to respect its history and its trophies,\u201d he said. \u201cI grew up watching this club win three Champions League titles in a row. I\u2019m not surprised to see Real Madrid winning trophies. I wanted to be part of the club\u2019s success from now on. It\u2019s a team with a winning mentality and I can\u2019t wait to get started.\u201d\nAlexander-Arnold said he looked up to Alonso when the new Madrid coach played for Liverpool.\n\u201cI told him he was an idol of mine and now being with him is a dream come true,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s had a big impact on the way I play. He did impossible things and influenced me in terms of training and working hard. I have him to thank for my high standards.\u201d\nMadrid also this week introduced central defender Dean Huijsen.\nOnly one alternative to Liverpool\nAlexander-Arnold, who will wear the No. 12 jersey with \u201cTrent\u201d on the back, arrived on a six-year contract through June 2031. He joins fellow England international Jude Bellingham.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve spoken about Liverpool and Real Madrid,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s the kind of player you want to have as a friend. I want to know what he\u2019s like. I\u2019ve seen him play for the national team and I also want to see him play for Real Madrid. They say he played an important role in bringing me here, but the club needs no introduction. It was a huge opportunity for me.\u201d\nAlexander-Arnold won nine titles with Liverpool, including one Champions League and two Premier Leagues.\n\u201cWe welcome a player who has won everything and who marked an era in a prestigious club such as Liverpool,\u201d P\u00e9rez said. \u201cYou could have continued playing in any other club but you chose to continue your career with our club and we will never forget that.\u201d\nMadrid and the other 31 teams playing in the Club World Cup are allowed to make early signings in FIFA-approved special transfer windows from June 1-10 and June 27-July 3.\nAlexander-Arnold had already announced he was leaving his boyhood club with Madrid the expected destination. He made 354 appearances for Liverpool and scored 23 goals.\n\u201cI always knew that if I ever left Liverpool, it would be to join Real Madrid,\u201d he said. \u201cThere came a time when I had to decide whether to leave or stay, and it wasn\u2019t easy. I\u2019d been there for so long that it wasn\u2019t easy. There comes a time when you have to make a decision, and for me, this was the right one. I\u2019ve been lucky to play for the biggest team in England and now I\u2019m at the biggest in Spain.\u201d\nBy its own high standards, Madrid had a disappointing season, finishing runner-up to rival Barcelona in La Liga and being eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Champions League despite having signed France star Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 last summer.\n___\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer"

      "text": "Barcelona says Ter Stegen is back as captain after medical report is sent to Spanish league\nMADRID (AP) \u2014 Barcelona says Marc-Andre ter Stegen will return as first-team captain after announcing on Friday that the goalkeeper had authorized the club to send his medical report to the Spanish league.\nThe announcement came as Ter Stegen talked of how \u201cespecially difficult\u201d the past few months have been, and he criticized suggestions he was to blame for Barcelona\u2019s inability to register new players, insisting that his back surgery and recovery timeline were fully approved by the club.\nThe disagreement led to the 33-year-old Ter Stegen being stripped of the club\u2019s captaincy on Thursday. But that changed Friday.\n\u201cThe club announces that the player Marc-Andre ter Stegen has signed the authorization necessary for the club to send La Liga the medical report relating to his surgery,\u201d Barcelona said in a statement. \u201cThe disciplinary case has been closed and the player is captain of the first team once again with immediate effect.\u201d\nThe club had opened a disciplinary proceeding against the goalkeeper on Tuesday after discrepancies about the recovery time for the lower back surgery that Ter Stegen successfully underwent last week.\nBarcelona needed him to sign the injury report so it could be sent to the Spanish league in order to clear some salary-cap space and allow the club to more easily register other players without breaching financial fair play rules.\n\u201cThese past few months have been especially difficult for me, both physically and personally,\u201d Ter Stegen said in a statement on social media. \u201cLike any player, after suffering an injury, my only priority has always been to return to the field as soon as possible, motivated solely by the desire to help the team and do what I love most: compete.\u201d\nHe added that \u201ccompletely unfounded\u201d things were said about him in recent weeks, so he felt it was \u201cnecessary to express my version of events with respect, but also with clarity.\u201d\n\u201cThe decision to undergo surgery was made after consulting with medical professionals and was fully approved by the club,\u201d he said. \u201cI publicly announced the estimated recovery period, which was given to me by top medical experts and always in coordination with the club.\u201d\nTer Stegen said ahead of the surgery that the recovery time would be about three months. The club did not give an official timetable for the recovery process, saying only that the operation was \u201csuccessful\u201d and that \u201chis recovery will determine when he can return.\u201d\n\u201cAt no point could I have thought that my unfortunate situation \u2014 having to undergo another operation \u2014 was necessary to register other teammates whom I deeply respect and am looking forward to sharing the locker room with for many seasons,\u201d he said. \u201cAny other interpretation seems to me both unfair and inaccurate.\u201d\nThe club signed Espanyol goalkeeper Joan Garc\u00eda in June. Its other goalkeepers are veteran Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny and I\u00f1aki Pe\u00f1a.\n\u201cThroughout my career, I have always tried to conduct myself with professionalism, respect, and commitment to the crests I\u2019ve represented,\u201d he said. \u201cI have deep affection for FC Barcelona, this city, and its people, who have supported me over so many years. My commitment to these colors remains absolute.\u201d\nTer Stegen missed nearly all of last season because of a ruptured tendon in his knee, and in 2023 he missed about two months because of another back operation. Pe\u00f1a and the 35-year-old Szcz\u0119sny started in place of Ter Stegen last season.\nBarcelona, the defending Spanish league champion, arrived back in Spain on Tuesday after completing a preseason tour in Asia. It will face Italian club Como in its final preseason match on Sunday in Barcelona. Its league debut is at Mallorca next Saturday.\n___\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer"

He stayed put and was one of Espanyol\u2019s best players.\nGarc\u00eda has yet to debut for Spain\u2019s senior side, but it\u2019s considered only a matter of time before he does if he continues to play well. He helped Spain win the Olympic gold medal in Paris last year.\n\u201cThe time has come to part ways. Today I say goodbye to the club that has been my home since I was 15,\u201d he said on social media. \u201cI\u2019ve given everything to help the team, to represent this badge with the utmost dedication, and to live up to what it means to wear this shirt.\u201d\nGarc\u00eda said he would understand the backlash from Espanyol fans for him joining its rival.\n\u201cI know this decision won\u2019t be easy for everyone to understand,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not asking you to do so. But I do want you to know that it was a carefully considered decision, considering not only my career, but also what\u2019s best for the club, my family, and me.\u201d\nGarc\u00eda\u2019s arrival to Barcelona puts in question the role of veteran Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen, who was injured most of the season. Ter Stegen is under contract through 2028.\nFollowing Ter Stegen\u2019s injury, Barcelona convinced Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny to come out of retirement and sign a contract for the remainder of last season. Barcelona\u2019s other goalkeeper is I\u00f1aki Pe\u00f1a.\nWhile several Barcelona players have joined Espanyol later in their careers, it is rare for an Espanyol player to move to Barcelona. Their derbies are heated affairs.\nBarcelona won the Spanish league this year.\n___\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer"

Alonso will take over on June 1 and will be given a contract through June 2028, the club said.\nHe\u2019s to be presented as coach on Monday.\nThe 65-year-old Ancelotti is departing after four mostly successful seasons with Madrid. He bid a tearful farewell on Saturday in the team\u2019s final Spanish league match. Ancelotti\u2019s contract ran to the end of next season, but the club confirmed his departure on Friday after he had already been announced as the next Brazil coach.\nMadrid began the season by winning the UEFA Super Cup title but mostly struggled since then, failing to lift another trophy and losing all four \u201ccl\u00e1sico\u201d matches against rival Barcelona, which clinched a league and cup double.\nAncelotti on Friday said he felt Alonso had the potential to succeed at Madrid.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to offer advice, because everyone has their own ideas about soccer,\u201d he said. \u201cAll I can say is that he\u2019s hugely fortunate to be Real Madrid\u2019s coach. I wish him all the best, and all the luck in the world. I think he has the attributes to coach this team. I hope he enjoys it.\u201d\nThe club\u2019s official TV channel prepared a video with highlights of Alonso\u2019s career, both as a player and as a coach, saying that \u201cnow he has in front of him the greatest challenge any coach can face, which is to sit on the bench of Real Madrid.\u201d\nThe 43-year-old Alonso is returning to a familiar environment.\n\u201cAlonso is one of the biggest legends of Real Madrid and world football. He defended our shirt in 236 official games between 2009 and 2014. He won six titles during this time: the 10th European Cup in Lisbon, one European Super Cup, one league title, two Spanish Cups and one Spanish Super Cup,\u201d the club said.\n\u201cNow he\u2019s returning to Real Madrid as one of the best coaches in the world after making history with Bayer Leverkusen,\u201d the club said.\nAs coach, Alonso led Leverkusen to an unprecedented German league and cup double last year in his first full season after taking over the team when it was in the Bundesliga\u2019s relegation zone the season before.\nHis team remains the only one to complete a whole Bundesliga campaign unbeaten. Leverkusen\u2019s only defeat in 2023-24 was to Atalanta in the Europa League final, and it bounced back three days later by winning the 2024 German Cup.\nLeverkusen\u2019s 35-game unbeaten run in the Bundesliga ended in August 2024 with a 3-2 loss at home to Leipzig, against whom Alonso\u2019s team uncharacteristically squandered a two-goal lead.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t just train us \u2014 you inspired us,\u201d Leverkusen captain Granit Xhaka wrote on Instagram after Alonso confirmed his departure. \u201cWe\u2019ll carry your lessons far beyond the field.\u201d\nAs a player for Spain and Madrid, Alonso displayed an understanding of the game and technical skills that created time and space for himself, and opportunities for others. Real Sociedad and Liverpool previously benefited from his intelligence in midfield. He helped the latter to the Champions League title in 2005.\nAlonso starred as a Madrid player, winning six titles, including the Spanish league in 2012 and the 2014 Champions League before leaving for three Bundesliga titles with Bayern Munich.\nThere was always a feeling in Madrid he would return. The club takes pride in bringing former greats back for coaching or management roles, like Zinedine Zidane or Jorge Valdano, and Alonso seemed predestined for coaching after a playing career spent managing teammates.\nAlonso began his coaching career with Madrid\u2019s youth teams before returning to Real Sociedad, another former club, to take over its reserve team. He led it to promotion.\nHe exceeded expectations after Leverkusen sporting director Simon Rolfes and chief executive Fernando Carro gave him his first job in senior management in October 2022.\nNow he will face different demands at Madrid, where he will be tasked with responding to a buoyant Barcelona team spearheaded by the outstanding Lamine Yamal and Brazil forward Raphinha supported by a cast of home-grown young stars such as Pedri and Gavi.\nHe will have to put the team\u2019s top stars \u2013 Kylian Mbapp\u00e9, Jude Bellingham and Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior \u2013 back on track after they failed to help the team succeed toward the end of the season.\nDespite his success in leading Madrid to three Champions League titles, Ancelotti was considered a coach who largely let the players have their way, giving their individual brilliance full reign.\nAlonso is likely to be more structured with a clear idea of how he wants each player to fit into his team. One priority will be strengthening the defense after serious injuries there last season undermined Ancelotti\u2019s hopes of defending the Spanish league and Champions League titles.\nMadrid has already addressed that with the signing of Spain defender Dean Huijsen from Bournemouth. More arrivals are likely.\nWhichever players come or go, Alonso will face the same demands \u2014 to get Madrid back on top in Spain and challenging for a record-extending 16th European crown.\nIt\u2019s just his second job in senior management.\n___\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer"
