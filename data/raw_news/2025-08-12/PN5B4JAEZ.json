  "title": "Social Security cost-of-living adjustment may be 2.7% in 2026, new estimates find",
  "description": "Social Security beneficiaries may see a slightly higher inflation adjustment to their benefits in 2026, based on new estimates from the latest inflation data.",
  "content": "Social Security beneficiaries may see a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment in 2026, according to new estimates from policy experts, based on the latest government inflation data. That projected increase would be higher than the 2.5% adjustment beneficiaries saw in 2025. Social Security implements a cost-of-living adjustment every year to adjust benefits for inflation. The Social Security Administration typically announces the official change for the upcoming year in October. New estimates from both Mary Johnson, an independent Social Security and Medicare policy analyst, and the Senior Citizens League, a nonpartisan senior group, point to a 2.7% COLA for 2026, based on new July inflation data.\n\nLast month, Johnson had estimated a 2.7% Social Security COLA for 2026, while the Senior Citizens League had projected 2.6%. Social Security cost-of-living adjustments have averaged 2.6% over the past 20 years, according to the Senior Citizens League. To be sure, there are still two months of inflation data that will be factored into the official COLA calculation for next year.\n\nThe official Social Security cost-of-living is based on three months' of government inflation data for July, August and September, which is averaged and compared to the same three months for the previous year. The percentage difference from one year to the next determines the COLA. The COLA is calculated based on a subset of the consumer price index, the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, or CPI-W.\n\nThe consumer price index was up 2.7% over the past 12 months, according to new July data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Tuesday. The CPI-W was up 2.5% over the last 12 months as of July. Tariffs had just a modest effect on the latest consumer price index data, though the impact of the new policies did show up in several areas including household furnishings and supplies. If tariffs do affect inflation in the coming two months, that may impact the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment for 2026.",

      "text": "The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment for 2026 is projected to be the lowest increase that millions of beneficiaries have seen in recent years.\nThis could change, however, due to potential inflationary pressures from tariffs.\nRecent estimates for the 2026 COLA, based latest government inflation data, place the adjustment to be around 2.2% to 2.3%, which are below the 2.5% increase that went into effect in 2025.\nThe COLA for 2026 may be 2.2%, estimates Mary Johnson, an independent Social Security and Medicare analyst. Meanwhile, the Senior Citizens League, a nonpartisan senior group, estimates next year's adjustment could be 2.3%.\nIf either estimate were to go into effect, the COLA for 2026 would be the lowest increase since 2021, when beneficiaries saw a 1.3% increase.\nAs the Covid pandemic prompted inflation to rise, the Social Security cost-of-living adjustments rose to four-decade highs. In 2022, the COLA was 5.9%, followed by 8.7% in 2023 and 3.2% in 2024.\nThe 2.5% COLA for 2025, while the lowest in recent years, is closer to the 2.6% average for the annual benefit bumps over the past 20 years, according to the Senior Citizens League.\nTo be sure, the estimates for the 2026 COLA are indeed preliminary and subject to change, experts say.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nHere's the inflation breakdown for March 2025 \u2014 in one chart\nDon't miss these tax strategies during the tariff sell-off\nSelling out during the market's worst days can hurt you\nThe Social Security Administration determines the annual COLA based on third-quarter data for Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, or CPI-W.\nNew government inflation data released on Thursday shows the CPI-W has increased 2.2% over the past 12 months. As such, the 2.5% COLA is currently outpacing inflation.\nYet that may not last depending on whether the Trump administration's plans for tariffs go into effect. Trump announced on Wednesday that tariff rates for many countries will be dropped to 10% for 90 days to allow more time for negotiations.\nTariffs may affect 2026 Social Security COLA\nIf the tariffs are implemented as planned, economists expect they will raise consumer prices, which may prompt a higher Social Security cost-of-living adjustment for 2026 than currently projected.\n\"We could see the effect of inflation in the coming months, and it could very well be by the third quarter,\" Johnson said.\nIf that happens, the 2026 COLA could go up to 2.5% or higher, she said.\nRetirees are already struggling with higher costs for day-to-day items like eggs, according to the Senior Citizens League. Meanwhile, new tariff policies may keep food prices high and increase the costs of prescription drugs, medical equipment and auto insurance, according to the senior group.\nMost seniors do not feel Social Security's annual cost-of-living adjustments keep up with the economic realities of the inflation they personally experience, the Senior Citizens League's polls have found, according to Alex Moore, a statistician at the senior group.\n\"Seniors generally feel that that the inflation they experience is higher than the inflation reported by the CPI-W,\" Moore said.\nWhen costs are poised to go up and the economic outlook is uncertain, seniors may be more likely to feel financial stress because their resources are more fixed and stabilized, he said."

      "text": "A widely followed measure of inflation accelerated slightly less than expected in July on an annual basis as President Donald Trump's tariffs showed mostly modest impacts and investors grew more confidence about interest rate cuts ahead.\nThe consumer price index increased a seasonally adjusted 0.2% for the month and 2.7% on a 12-month basis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday. That compared with the respective Dow Jones estimates for 0.2% and 2.8%.\nExcluding food and energy, the core CPI increased 0.3% for the month and 3.1% from a year ago, compared with the forecasts for 0.3% and 3%. Federal Reserve officials generally consider core inflation to be a better reading for longer-term trends. The monthly core rate was the biggest increase since January while the annual rate was the highest since February.\nA 0.2% increase in shelter costs drove much of the rise in the index, while food prices were flat and energy fell 1.1%, the BLS said. Tariff-sensitive new vehicle prices also were unchanged though used cars and trucks saw a 0.5% jump. Transportation and medical care services both posted 0.8% moves higher.\nStock market averages posted strong gains after the report though Treasury yields were mixed. Traders ramped up bets that the Federal Reserve would start reducing rates again in September.\nTariffs did appear to show up in several categories.\nFor instance, household furnishings and supplies showed a 0.7% increase after rising 1% in June. However, apparel prices were up just 0.1% and core commodity prices increased just 0.2%. Canned fruits and vegetables, which generally are imported and also sensitive to tariffs, were flat.\n\"The tariffs are in the numbers, but they're certainly not jumping out hair on fire at this point,\" former White House economist Jared Bernstein said on CNBC. Bernstein served under former President Joe Biden.\nThe report comes at both a critical time for the economy and the BLS itself, which has come under Trump's criticism for what he has charged is political bias against him. Trump fired the prior BLS commissioner after a surprisingly weak July nonfarm payrolls report earlier this month, and on Monday said he would nominate E.J. Antoni, a critic of the bureau, as the new chief.\nThe bureau has been hampered by budget and staffing cuts and has halted data collection in multiple cities. Along with that, the data has had to impute values in a number of the goods and services it tracks, leading to questions over accuracy and credibility.\nWhile the political jockeying has occurred, Fed officials have been watching inflation measures closely as they weigh their next interest rate decision in September.\n\"Inflation is on the rise, but it didn't increase as much as some people feared,\" said Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. \"In the short term, markets will likely embrace these numbers because they should allow the Fed to focus on labor-market weakness and keep a September rate cut on the table. Longer term, we likely haven't seen the end of rising prices as tariffs continue to work their way through the economy.\"\nAt issue is whether the tariffs will cause a one-time price increase or will lead to a lasting upturn for inflation. Economists generally view tariff impacts as the former though the broad swath of items covered under Trump's edicts have sparked worries that the effect could be longer lasting.\nFutures market pricing is pointing strongly to a Fed rate cut in September. However, a raft of data between now and then could influence both the decision for that meeting and the central bank's future course. Fed officials of late have been expressing increasing levels of concern about the labor market, which would bode for rate reductions.\nTraders increased the implied odds for a September move following the release, and also put the chances of another reduction in October at about 67%, up from 55% the day before, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool.\nThe CPI is not the Fed's primary inflation forecast tool. The central bank uses the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index, but the CPI, as well as the producer price index that is scheduled to be released Thursday, feeds into that calculation.\nInflation-adjusted average hourly earnings rose just 0.1% for the month, the BLS said in a separate release. That put the annual gain at 1.2%."

      "text": "The Social Security Administration on Thursday announced that the cost-of-living adjustment will be 2.5% in 2025.\nWhen that increase goes into effect, it will be the lowest adjustment to benefits that beneficiaries have seen since 2021, when the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, was 1.3%.\nThe Social Security cost-of-living adjustment was put in place to help benefits keep pace with inflation.\nThe COLA is calculated based on a subset of the consumer price index known as the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, or CPI-W. The percentage increase in the CPI-W from the third quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year determines the cost-of-living adjustment.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nSocial Security Administration announces 2.5% COLA for 2025\nHouse may force vote on bill affecting pensioners' Social Security benefits\n72% of Americans worry Social Security will run out in their lifetime\nAs government inflation data shows the pace of inflation has subsided, the size of the annual increase to benefits has come down.\n\"It's better when the number is small, because it means that the inflation experienced by seniors is not as bad as it might have been,\" said Charles Blahous, senior research strategist at George Mason University's Mercatus Center.\nThe 2025 adjustment is not the lowest the Social Security COLA has been. In 2016, 2011 and 2010, it was zero, and beneficiaries saw no increase at all in those years.\nStill, for retirees, people with disabilities and other beneficiaries, the lower adjustment for 2025 comes as they continue to grapple with high costs.\n\"Before the inflation got so high, we just took lower costs for granted,\" said Mary Johnson, an independent Social Security and Medicare policy analyst who is also a Social Security beneficiary. \"It really has significantly changed how we have to manage since then.\"\nHaving a lower cost-of-living adjustment when prices are still high \u2014 and when inflation was higher in the earlier part of this year \u2014 is going to be a \"real sticker shock for some people,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director at The Senior Citizens League.\nExperts debate best COLA measurement\nThere is a debate among advocates and lawmakers as to whether a different measurement should be used for the cost-of-living adjustment. Such a change would have to be approved by Congress.\nThe current annual increase that's automatic and compounds from year to year is very valuable, said Jenn Jones, vice president for government affairs at senior advocacy group AARP.\n\"That makes Social Security really unique and really special and important for older Americans,\" Jones said.\nAARP supports a COLA measurement that is accurate and reflective of what older Americans are spending, she said. Another experimental index \u2014 the Consumer Price Index for the Elderly, or CPI-E \u2014 may better reflect seniors' spending patterns, the nonpartisan group argues.\n\"Whenever Congress chooses to act in a bipartisan way to finally shore up Social Security's financial future, we do believe that CPI-E should be a part of that discussion,\" Jones said.\nAfter the announcement of the COLA for 2025 on Thursday, other senior advocacy groups also spoke out in favor of switching to the CPI-E, including the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, and Social Security Works.\n\"The traditional formula (CPI-W) does not fully account for the impact of inflation on the goods and services seniors spend the most money on \u2014 especially health care and housing,\" Max Richtman, president and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, said in a statement.\nNot everyone agrees the CPI-E would be the best measure. Because one-third of Social Security beneficiaries are not elderly, it would not make sense to use an index focused on that population, Blahous said. Instead, he said, the chained CPI, which measures changes in consumer spending patterns, would be a better fit.\nWashington lawmakers have proposed bills that would change the way Social Security's annual cost-of-living adjustment is measured, prompting Social Security Works to declare \"Social Security's COLA is on the ballot\" this November in a statement released Thursday."

      "text": "Inflation held steady in July as price declines for staples like groceries and gasoline helped offset price increases for consumers.\nHowever, there were worrying signs under the surface, including evidence that Trump administration policies are stoking inflation for certain goods and services, economists said. Those effects will likely become more pronounced later this year, they said.\n\"Tariff and immigration policy fingerprints are all over the report,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's, said.\n\"The tariff and immigration effects aren't screaming at us, but they're certainly speaking very loudly and over the next couple months they'll start yelling,\" Zandi said.\nThe consumer price index rose 2.7% in July relative to a year earlier, unchanged from the prior month and less than expected, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Tuesday.\nThe CPI is a widely used measure of inflation that tracks how quickly prices rise or fall for a basket of goods and services, from haircuts to coffee, clothing and concert tickets.\nIn July, grocery and gasoline prices declined \u2014 or, deflated \u2014 by a respective 0.1% and 2.2% on a monthly basis from June, according to the CPI data.\nEconomists like to look at inflation data that strips out energy and food prices, which can be volatile from month to month.\nThis so-called core CPI figure has been rising in recent months: It climbed 3.1% in July 2025 from July 2024. That's up from a 2.9% annual pace in June and is the fastest annual rate for core CPI since February.\n\"[W]e expect it will rise further to a peak of 3.8% by the end of the year as tariffs bleed through more fully to consumer prices,\" Michael Pearce, deputy chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote Tuesday.\nInflation most evident for consumer goods\nTariffs are a tax placed on imports, paid by U.S. companies that import the good or service.\nBusinesses generally pass on those higher costs to consumers, at least in part, economists said. The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates the average household will lose $2,400 in the short run as a result of all tariffs the Trump administration put in place as of Aug. 6.\nTariff effects are most apparent for goods prices, like those for household furnishings and apparel, Zandi said.\nInflation for all core commodities \u2014 which strips out food and energy commodities \u2014 was up 0.2% in each of the last two months, according to the CPI data. In more typical times, goods prices are generally flat or declining, Zandi said.\n\"That they're on the rise is clear evidence of tariff impact,\" Zandi said.\nHousehold furnishings prices were up 0.7% on a monthly basis in July, according to the CPI data. Apparel prices were up a more muted 0.1%, and toys 0.2%.\nNot a 'one-month event'\nOn an annual basis, core commodities inflation was up 1.2% in July, the fastest pace in over two years.\n\"There are clear signs a range of goods prices are moving higher, pushing core goods inflation to a more than two-year high, but some major tariffed items, including autos and major appliances, have yet to show much impact,\" Pearce wrote.\nStephen Miran, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said Tuesday on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" that the CPI data shows \"no evidence whatsoever\" that tariffs have fueled higher consumer prices.\n\"It just hasn't panned out,\" Miran said.\nThe full effect of tariffs is unlikely to be felt for several months, as businesses delay passing on higher costs, economists said.\n\"This isn't a one-month event,\" said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Economics. \"The impact will be dragged out over many months, as businesses are waiting to see where those tariffs settle.\"\nThey may test consumers' price sensitivity slowly instead of all at once, she said. Companies may also still be selling old inventory that wasn't subject to import duties, economists said.\n\"It's been a very dynamic time for these trade negotiations ... but we're still, you know, a ways away from seeing where things settle down,\" Jerome Powell, Federal Reserve chair, said last month.\nAdditionally, there's evidence that Trump administration policy around immigration is limiting the supply of immigrant labor in certain sectors of the economy, putting upward pressure on inflation, Zandi said.\nThis is most apparent in personal care services \u2014 categories like haircuts, dry cleaning and pet services \u2014 that employ a lot of immigrants, he said. Fewer immigrants working in these sectors limits labor supply and puts upward pressure on the wages businesses pay to attract workers, he said."
