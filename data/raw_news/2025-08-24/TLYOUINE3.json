Some like the fan on for white noise, while others like to listen to ASMR to drift off to sleep. Some people have the lights on, some have them off; you get it, it\u2019s all about preferences. Apparently, though, a couple of US President Donald Trump\u2019s sleeping habits caused a confrontation with his staff, per one of his close acquaintances.\n\u2022 None Shoppers Say They've Been Using This 'Beautiful' $7 Lipstick 'Since the Late 80's or Early 90's'\n\u2022 None How Do You Raise Good Kids in Terrifying Times?

This was a confrontation,\u201d he said.\n\nYou may be wondering: Why could no locks be installed? Well, according to The Week, the US President isn\u2019t allowed to do so because their armed guards need easier access to them. Plus, the armed guard is always out front, and having to go through a locked door could be a security risk.\n\nNow, this actually isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve heard about this bedroom habit. Back in 2019, in Free, Melania: the Unauthorized Biography, it was revealed that Donald originally asked for a lock on his door back then, too.\n\nBut then, Wolff also discussed a second altercation with the White House staff, saying, \u201cThen there was another issue when the White House domestic staff changed his sheets, and he had a fit.

      "text": "Turns out it may be beneficial to listen to complete strangers generate oddly satisfying sounds on the internet. Welcome to the world of ASMR, a peculiar psychological phenomenon that just might be your next obsession.\nAutonomous sensory meridian response is an experience characterized by a tingling sensation that begins at the top of your scalp and travels down your spine. These short-lived tingles are said to create feelings of tranquility and euphoria. While there is no definitive reason it occurs, Dr. Craig Richard, a pharmaceutical scientist at the Shenandoah University School of Pharmacy, hypothesizes on his site, ASMR University, that ASMR is induced through stimuli that trigger the biological pathways of intrapersonal bonding, releasing serotonin, dopamine, oxytocin and endorphins. In other words, it\u2019s a rush of all the feel-good chemicals at once \u2014 which explains why ASMR is often referred to as a \u201cbrain orgasm.\u201d\nThese tingles are often felt as a result of a wide range of external stimuli, like a soothing voice, a gentle touch or exposure to a slow, precise or repetitive motion. For some, it could be hearing someone slowly flip through pages of a magazine. For me, it\u2019s watching the Trader Joe\u2019s cashier carefully pack my groceries.\n\u201cFor people who do experience ASMR, there are a variety of stimuli that trigger it, and they are not the same for everyone.\u201d Richard tells SheKnows. \u201cIt is similar to a group of people all liking a type of music, but not everyone liking the same artists, styles and subgenres.\u201d\nIn the hopes of building a foundation of evidence to encourage scientific inquiry and research funding for this phenomenon, Richard founded ASMR University, the most comprehensive research project on ASMR to date, with over 25,000 participants. But because there is no known scientific method to measure this internal sensation, the available research is based entirely on self-reporting \u2014 and is therefore not super-conclusive, he notes.\nDespite this lack of scientific support, an entire subculture surrounding ASMR has continued to grow astronomically; type in \u2018ASMR\u2019 on YouTube, and you\u2019ll instantly get 12.7 million results.\nYouTube \u201cASMRtist\u201d Olivia Kissper, who has almost 300,000 subscribers, is just one of the thousands of individuals around the world working to simulate the sensory triggers of ASMR themselves. On her channel, Kissper experiments with a variety of relaxing audio-visual elements, like whispered messages, smooth brush strokes, and crinkling objects to bring the tingles to her audience.\n\u201cI feel that it\u2019s not just about the sounds. It\u2019s about the personal attention and providing pleasant intentions,\u201d Kissper, who also makes role-play videos of interactions with hairstylists giving a slow and precise haircut or teachers providing a student with undivided attention, tells SheKnows.\nMore: This Breathing Technique Can Calm You Down in 5 Minutes or Less\nWhile it all sounds a bit bizarre, these videos seem to actually help a ton of viewers around the world.\n\u201cThere are not any health benefits of ASMR that have been confirmed by clinical studies yet,\u201d Richard explains. \u201cOn the other hand, there are several published studies of people self-reporting that ASMR helps them to relax, de-stress and fall asleep as well as being helpful for conditions like anxiety, insomnia, depression and chronic pain.\u201d\nMore: 7 Tricks to Fall Asleep When It Feels Impossible\nAnd Kissper\u2019s subscribers confirm this. Kissper says that she has heard stories of subscribers who have curbed their addictions and gotten off of medications after watching her videos. She believes it has to do with the immense power of human connection and our unmet desire for this personal attention in what is an increasingly isolated society.\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you feel alone. Initially, you would have to wait until you connect with someone, but with these ASMR channels, you can have easy access to these personal connections at any time,\u201d Kissper says. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to get something people are starved of \u2014 a connection and intimacy and closeness without any goal.\u201d\nMore: YouTube Channels for & by Badass Women\nFor millions of people struggling emotionally around the world, ASMR videos are seen as free and effective treatment options waiting for them at the single click of a button. Is this the breakthrough cure for mental illness we\u2019ve been waiting for!?\nWell, not exactly.\n\u201cASMR is like a medication,\u201d Kissper explains. \u201cIt definitely helps with the symptoms of depression and anxiety, but it doesn\u2019t get to the root of the problem. It\u2019s OK to allow the content to make you feel better, but viewers need to address the problems themselves to see real change.\u201d\nSo, go ahead, pop in your headphones and give the videos a shot. While these tingles might not be the answer to all your problems, they certainly won\u2019t hurt."

      "text": "A renowned biographer of US President Donald Trump has shed light on how the entrepreneur-turned-politician\u2019s habits triggered a tiff with Secret Service Agents, entrusted with the task of protecting him.\nMichael Wolff, who penned the bestseller \u2018Fire and Fury\u2019 on Donald Trump\u2019s first stint in the White House, told the Daily Beast podcast that Trump put up a lock on his bedroom door against the wishes of the Secret Service, which resulted in a blow-up over security. The biographer claimed the Secret Service entered into a confrontation with the President over the lock before removing it.\nWolff also detailed another incident which saw Trump fly into a rage. That happened when the White House\u2019s domestic staff changed his sheets. \u201cHe had a fit,\u201d said Wolff. \u201cWhat\u2019s that about? I have no idea.\u201d\nThe biographer, known for his shocking revelations about the President\u2019s behaviour and lifestyle, also mentioned the way Trump conducts his office. Equating the current status of the White House to a \u201cbus station\u201d, Wolff said: It\u2019s just filled with people, 20 people, 30 people, more. They bring in chairs. Almost anyone can come in and sit down, and Trump is behind the desk talking, talking,\u201d Wolff said.\nThe journalist-turned-author also stated how Trump \u201cis always on the phone. \u201cI mean, I think until the last possible moment. He\u2019s talking, talking to somebody,\u201d said Wolff.\nWolff also shed light on Trump\u2019s talkative nature, stating it is \u201cdifficult to get a word in edgewise\u201d and \u201cthere is no breath\u201d.\n\u201cOne of the things that when he speaks, what is inside the head comes out of the mouth. So whatever confusion, chaos, churning, past grievances come out, and it doesn\u2019t stop,\u201d stating how one could sit with him for hours and never have a moment to say anything."

      "text": "In a world where some celebrities change partners as much as they change their underwear, it\u2019s refreshing when couples we love go the distance. It\u2019s just so hard to get attached to a famous pairing, only to have our hopes and dreams shattered when they break up. Don\u2019t they consider our feelings before they split? (Kidding, kidding.) But like we said, some couples we love go the distance, and don\u2019t care about showing how in love they really are. That\u2019s right, we\u2019re talking about couples who don\u2019t care about showing a little PDA.\nWe love love, and it brings us joy to watch our faves cuddle and share a kiss in public.

Look, we\u2019re not trying to judge, it just sometimes blindsides us! But we love seeing them so happy.\nWe rounded up some of our favorite celeb couples who have been together for a while and still lather on the public displays of affection.

      "text": "If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, SheKnows may receive an affiliate commission.\nWhen Netflix\u2019s docu-series Wild Wild Country, we fell down the rabbit hole of the Rajneesh movement. Then, once you\u2019ve made it through the entire six-part series, it\u2019s impossible to stave off your curiosity about other cults. What is it that makes certain people susceptible to such polarizing pedagogy? What leads a person to the \u201ccalling\u201d of a cult leader? And, most pressingly, can binge-watching documentaries about real-life cults offer any insight into the bizarre worlds inhabited by such people?\nThe lives of members of infamous cults, like the one chronicled in Wild Wild Country, make compelling fodder for limited television series and TV movies. So, you be the judge. Thanks to streaming giants like Netflix, Amazon and Hulu, it\u2019s easier than ever to take a psychedelic trip into the belief systems of cult leaders and their followers.\nWe\u2019ve gleaned quite a few mind-blowing examples to get you started. But be forewarned, the following documentaries may leave you with more questions than answers.\n-\n\u2018Wild Wild Country\u2019\nAn oft-forgotten piece of American history, the Oregon cult formed by Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh in the \u201980s made it abundantly clear why separation of church and state is so important (read: poisoning people to win an election is always a bad idea). The personalities examined in this jaw-dropping docu-series are so unfathomably eccentric that you almost forget that they\u2019re real, not fictional characters.\nWatch it on Netflix.\n-\n\u2018Children of God: Lost and Found\u2019\nThis documentary won\u2019t just blow your mind \u2014 it will break your heart, too. Filmmaker and reformed Children of God cult member Noah Thompson bravely seeks out other families whose lives were fractured by sexual abuse and bondage that children endured as part of \u201cThe Family.\u201d Interesting fact: Both Rose McGowan and Joaquin Phoenix were born into this cult but escaped with relatives before any lasting damage was done.\n-\n\u2018The Source Family\u2019\nFather Yod: That\u2019s how Jim Baker was known to his followers, who subscribed to their founder\u2019s hippy-dippy, hedonistic principles. In real life, he was a restaurateur and rumored bank robber \u2014 a man who accumulated people in an attempt to validate his bizarre delusions.\nWatch it on Tubi.\n-\n\u2018Waco: The Rules of Engagement\u2019\nCould the 1993 tragedy in Waco, Texas, have been prevented? William Gazecki\u2019s Oscar-nominated 1997 documentary immerses viewers in the Branch Davidians cult formed by David Koresh, as well as the standoff that resulted in the death of federal agents and 76 members of the religious sect.\nWatch it on Netflix.\n-\n\u2018Going Clear\u2019\nConsidered the definitive Scientology documentary, Alex Gibney\u2019s examination of the religion\u2019s history and controversial founder will leave you dumbfounded. The fact that several high-profile celebrities still openly identify as Scientologists? That may be just as mysterious as the tenets discussed in Going Clear.\nWatch it on Tubi.\n-\n\u2018Heaven\u2019s Gate: The Untold Story\u2019\nArguably one of the best-known cults, Heaven\u2019s Gate was a religious sect based out of San Diego that believed in, well, aliens. Confident that a UFO would save them all from certain death and deliver them to some existential plane of existence, 39 members participated in a mass suicide. Spoiler alert: The extraterrestrials didn\u2019t show.\n-\n\u2018Holy Hell\u2019\nWatch Will Allen\u2019s documentary about the Buddhafield movement, and you\u2019ll walk away with a serious case of the heebie-jeebies. A member of the cult for 22 years, Allen provides a chilling behind-the-scenes glimpse into life under founder Michel Rostand \u2014 who was eventually found to be guilty of forcing young men to have sex with him.\nWatch it on Tubi.\n-\n\u2018Jamestown: The Life and Death of People\u2019s Temple\u2019\nEver hear someone described as \u201cdrinking the Kool-Aid\u201d? The saying comes from the story of polygamist fundamentalist Jim Jones and his People\u2019s Temple. In 1978, the cult leader and almost all of his 900 followers committed mass suicide at their Guyana settlement by sipping poisoned drinks. Amy Berg\u2019s documentary includes interviews with former members as well as survivors of that fateful day.\nWatch it on Netflix.\n-\n\u2018Manson\u2019\nIf your skin doesn\u2019t crawl while watching this chilling 1973 documentary about Charles Manson, you\u2019re made of stronger stuff than us, friend. Go inside the Manson Family\u2019s Devil\u2019s Canyon compound with filmmakers Robert Hendrickson and Laurence Merrick for an unforgettable look at this murderous cult.\n-\n\u2018AUM: The Cult at the End of the World\u2019\nAUM: The Cult at the End of the World is quite shocking, and quite disturbing as we hear the story of Aum Shinrikyo, the doomsday cult from the 90s. If this cult sounds familiar, it\u2019s the cult that was behind the chemical domestic terrorist attack on March 1995, in Tokyo.\n-\n\u2018The Program: Cons, Cults, and Kidnapping\u2019\nThe Program: Cons, Cults, and Kidnapping is a very traumatic watch. We know it\u2019s a docuseries rather than a documentary, but it\u2019s a must-watch. It follows a woman \u201chaunted by her teenage experience at a troubled youth program,\u201d per IMDb. Now what program?

      "text": "A dad recently took to Reddit\u2018s AITA forum after a disagreement with his daughter over her bedroom door. The 15-year-old expressed that she wanted a lock on her door for privacy because her younger brothers keep coming in without knocking.\n\u201cI said OK and a couple days later I bought a lock similar to what you find on bathroom doors which can be opened with a coin or flathead from the outside,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI installed it but my daughter said she didn\u2019t want a lock like that, she wanted a lock where only she had a key. Not me or my wife or anyone else.\u201d\nThe dad told his daughter he didn\u2019t want to do that in case an emergency pops up, and they need to get into her room. \u201cI\u2019ve already talked to my sons about respecting a door that\u2019s locked and from what my daughter\u2019s told me they aren\u2019t trying to snoop in her room, they are just careless sometimes with asking for permission before entering,\u201d he explained.\nNow his daughter is upset with him. His wife, meanwhile, suggested giving their daughter the lock she wants and then making secret key copies for themselves but the dad doesn\u2019t feel comfortable keeping a secret like that. \u201cAITA?\u201d he asked Reddit.\nThe general consensus was no, the Reddit user is not TA in this particular situation, but that there are plenty of other ways to make sure his daughter has her privacy. Many pointed out that lying about the extra keys wasn\u2019t necessary.\n\u201cIf you get a keyed lock, I don\u2019t think you should lie to your daughter about not having one,\u201d a user wrote. \u201cYou should say that she can have one, but only if you get a copy \u2013 otherwise, no dice. If not, then the lock that you have should be sufficient. If the door is locked, then her brothers will have to ask for permission either way, so I\u2019m not entirely sure why she\u2019d be upset.\u201d\nMultiple people suggested that the OP needs to offer stricter consequences to his sons for barging into their sister\u2019s room. \u201cNTA on the lock issue but at major AH on the just talking to your sons about walking in on their sister,\u201d one person wrote. \u201cShe is 15 years old and has hit puberty. Pre-teen boys should know not to walk in on her. There should be disciplinary actions when they do.\u201d\nAnother user added: \u201cYou need to talk to your sons about respecting a door that\u2019s closed. Or even one that\u2019s not closed if it is not a space they are supposed to be in. They should never be in your daughter\u2019s room unless they are specifically invited by her.\u201d\nOthers noted that it could be helpful to give the daughter a lock box or cabinet so she can store any items she doesn\u2019t want her brothers finding, like a diary. \u201cThen she has guaranteed privacy for whatever sensitive items she has when when she\u2019s out of the room without the safety risks of having a full lock on the room door,\u201d someone suggested. \u201cGet her something like the IKEA Ivar or PS cabinets that have locking doors, they\u2019re $100-150 and are steel construction, so they\u2019ll last.\u201d\nWould you allow your child to have a keyed lock? What\u2019s your policy when it comes to privacy?\nEven when you\u2019re famous, Mom Guilt is a thing, as these celebrity moms show."

      "text": "No president is perfect and a job as complex as leading the United States brings about scandals is almost every administration. However, some presidential scandals will go down in history for their shocking outcomes.\nThe Monica Lewinsky scandal, which really should be called the Bill Clinton scandal, for example, has been seared into our brains over and over again.\nBut Clinton isn\u2019t the only one who has found himself in hot water for his sexual escapades, we can go back to our third president, Thomas Jefferson, and his long-debated involvement with his slave, Sally Hemings. Even the beauty of Camelot during the John F. Kennedy years was anything but perfect.\nAnd of course, other presidents found themselves deep in secret deals and diverted money that marred their administrations \u2014 it\u2019s not just about sex. In 2023, Donald Trump\u2019s mugshot for the Georgia election fraud case went viral on social media. Safe to say legal issues surrounding the White House are far from over either.\nRead about some of the biggest presidential scandals over the centuries and decide for yourself who messed up the most.\nA version of this story was originally published in 2021.\n-\nThomas Jefferson\u2019s Sex Scandal (1802)\nThomas Jefferson was the first president to have a sex scandal in 1802 when he denied having an affair with his slave, Sally Hemings, and having a family with her. But let\u2019s be clear on the historical facts of this situation, she didn\u2019t have any legal rights, nor was she allowed to deny Jefferson\u2019s \u201cunwanted sexual advances,\u201d per The Jefferson Monticello.\nJefferson was allowed to continue his presidency and in 1998, a DNA test provided credible evidence that the former president fathered at least one of Hemings\u2019 children.\n-\nWarren G. Hardings\u2019s Oil Scandal (1922)\nWarren G. Harding\u2019s administration faced some heat in 1922 when his Department of Interior Secretary Albert Fall took control of the oil reserves that were located on federal land in Wyoming. Instead of taking bids from private oil companies to have the right to operate those reserves, Fall took bribes, including gifts and no-interest loans for rights to the Teapot Dome oil fields. Of course, he didn\u2019t get to enjoy those sparkly presents because he was found guilty and sent to jail for his involvement in the mess.\n-\nJohn F. Kennedy\u2019s Alleged Affairs (1961-1963)\nMost of America didn\u2019t know that JFK had a messy personal life during his administration because they were too busy being sold the perfection of Camelot by the beautiful First Lady Jackie Kennedy. He reportedly preferred blondes for his affairs \u2014 a complete 180-degree difference from his brunette wife. It was his special assistant Dave Powers, who procured young women to sleep with the then 43-year-old president \u2014 from interns to Marilyn Monroe, the list was allegedly endless.\nOne Secret Service agent even described his job under the Kennedy administration, via History of Yesterday, \u201cEverybody thought you were risking your life, and you were actually out there to see that he\u2019s not disturbed while he\u2019s having an interlude in the shower with two gals from Twelfth Avenue.\u201d\n-\nRichard Nixon\u2019s Watergate Scandal (1972-1974)\nJust before Richard Nixon was re-elected president in 1972, there was a break-in at the Watergate Hotel, where the Democratic National Committee headquarters was located in Washington, D.C. The burglary was done by five of Nixon\u2019s campaign workers, and while he wasn\u2019t initially involved with the crime, it was the cover-up, wiretapping and secret recordings by the president and his advisers that shocked America.\nOn Aug. 9, 1974, Nixon announced his resignation on August 8, claiming that he did not have \u201ca strong enough political base\u201d to continue as president. His successor, Gerald Ford, pardoned him a month later on Sept. 8.\n-\nRonald Reagan & The Iran Contra Affair (1985-1987)\nThe Iran Contra Affair is messy. The U.S. had an arms embargo against Iran, but with seven American hostages and their lives at stake, Reagan made a secret deal to sell weapons to the country in exchange for the release of our U.S. citizens. The transaction came to light in 1986, when President Reagan admitted to the weapons sales, but claimed it had nothing to do with the return of the hostages.\n-\nBill Clinton\u2019s Affair (1995-1998)\nFormer President Bill Clinton notoriously had an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky but refused to admit it. (Remember that famous speech? \u201cI did not have sexual relations with that woman.\u201c)\nIt all took off when Pentagon employee Linda Tripp, who was confided in by Lewinsky, reported it all to lawyer and judge Kenneth Starr. Starr was already on the case regarding an alleged sexual harassment claim with former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones.\nAfter the accusations, th House of Representatives moved toward impeachment for obstruction of justice and perjury, but the Senate saved him with an acquittal in 1998. But blue dresses, cigars and berets never looked the same again to the American public.\n-\nGeorge Bush\u2019s Response to Hurricane Katrina (2005)\nOn August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans, Louisiana, and had a catastrophic effect on the city and its surrounding areas. The Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s (FEMA) response was sorely lacking as residents struggled to survive in the days after the storm had passed.\nInstead of heading right to the devastated areas, Bush surveyed the damage from Air Force One on his way home from vacation \u2014 and the outcry ensued. The insensitive flyover made affected Americans furious and it led to Kanye West stating that Bush \u201cdoesn\u2019t care about black people\u201d during a Hurricane Katrina telethon.\n-\nTrump\u2019s Second Impeachment (2021)\nAfter the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Donald Trump became the first president in U.S. history to be impeached twice while in office. On January 13, 2021, Congress charged him with \u201cincitement of insurrection\u201d for his role in riling up his supporters before the chaos ensued.\n\u201cWe fight like hell,\u201d he told the crowd, via NPR. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t fight like hell, you\u2019re not going to have a country anymore.\u201d Trump believed there was election fraud and allegedly encouraged his voter base to charge the Capitol before Congress could certify the Electoral College results.\nA week after Jan. 6, House Democrats accused Trump of inciting the mob, and the House voted to impeach him, making Trump the first president to be impeached twice. Trump was later acquitted during a Senate trial.\n-\nDonald Trump\u2019s First Impeachment (2019)\nTrump\u2019s first impeachment took place in 2019 after a formal House inquiry found that he had solicited foreign interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election to help his re-election bid.\nThe impeachment stemmed from a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in 2019 in which he urged Zelenskyy to investigate election rival President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who had served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.\nAround the same time, Trump blocked aid to Ukraine, prompting allegations that he used presidential powers to discredit his rival. The Senate eventually acquitted Trump.\n-\nDonald Trump\u2019s Criminal Conviction (2024)\nOn May 29, 2024, Donald Trump became the first president in United States history to be convicted of a crime. Trump was found guilty of 34 counts of fraud related to the hush money given to adult film actress Stormy Daniels.\nThe former president was found guilty of falsifying business records to reimburse his lawyer, Michael Cohen, for the $130,000 payment Cohen personally gave Daniels before the 2016 election.\nHe is due to face sentencing on Nov. 26 but many are predicting that the results of the Presidential election may shape the outcome of his criminal charges."
