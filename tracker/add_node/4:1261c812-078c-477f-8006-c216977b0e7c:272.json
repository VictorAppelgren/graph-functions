    "importance_classification": {
      "importance": 4,
      "rationale": "US illegal immigration figures are a macro‑level demographic indicator that can influence fiscal policy, labor markets, and sentiment, but they lack the immediate, high‑centrality impact of core currency or commodity moves. The data is useful for monitoring potential regime shifts or structural changes in immigration policy, yet it does not directly drive intraday trading or core asset pricing. Therefore it is best classified as a supporting signal with limited centrality, warranting a level‑4 importance."
