  "description": "This last-four clash is a rematch of the 2024 final.",
  "content": "Jessica Pegula has the opportunity to exact revenge for her defeat in last year's US Open final as she clashes once again with Aryna Sabalenka in New York for the 2025 Women's Singles semifinal.\n\nBelow, we'll outline the best live TV streaming services to watch every match of the tournament as it happens.\n\nAmerican star Pegula crashed to a 7-5 7-5 defeat to the world No. 1 in her first major final a year ago. She will be confident in today's last four matchup after an impressive run of wins at Flushing Meadows that was capped by a victory over Barbora Krej\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 in the quarterfinals.\n\nMeanwhile, defending champ Sabalenka comes into this clash with arguably more in her tank after the Belarusian was given free passage to the semifinals after her last-four opponent Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 was forced to withdraw due to injury.\n\nAryna Sabalenka vs. Jessica Pegula is set to start at 7 p.m. ET (4 p.m. PT) on Thursday at Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York. That makes it a midnight BST start in the UK, while the action gets underway for viewers in Australia at 9 a.m. AEST on Friday. Here's how you can watch the match for free with a VPN or via a live TV streaming subscription.\n\nLivestream Sabalenka vs. Pegula in the US\n\n\n\nLinear TV coverage of the US Open this year will chiefly be shown on ESPN. The women's singles will be shown on ESPN, ESPN Plus and ESPN Deportes, and the men's singles final will be broadcast on ABC, ESPN Plus and ESPN Deportes.\n\nThose wanting comprehensive coverage of this year's tournament will need to consider the all-new ESPN streaming service and its corresponding app. The platform will show every match of the tournament live, broadcasting each day at 11 a.m. ET and continuing until the close of play.\n\nMost live TV streaming services offer a free trial or discounts during the first month and allow you to cancel anytime. All require a solid internet connection. Looking for more information? Check out our live TV streaming services guide.\n\nLivestream Sabalenka vs. Pegula in the UK\n\nViewers in the UK can stream US Open action through Sky Sports, which has the exclusive live broadcast rights for this year's tournament.\n\nIf you already have Sky Sports as part of your TV package, you can stream matches via its Sky Go app, but cord-cutters will want to get set up with a Now account and a Now Sports membership to stream the action from New York.\n\nStream Sabalenka vs. Pegula in Australia for free\n\nTennis fans Down Under can watch live coverage of select US Open matches, including the men's and women's semifinals, on free-to-air Channel Nine's streaming service 9Now.\n\nFor dedicated tennis fans, pay-TV service Stan Sport is livestreaming every match on every court, ad-free.\n\nTSN will provide comprehensive live coverage of the 2025 US Open in Canada.",

Our hands-on testing process involves running over 250 internet speed tests per provider, checking for DNS leaks, streaming content from popular providers such as Netflix and BBC iPlayer and poring over privacy policies. ExpressVPN remains our pick as the best overall VPN by a razor-thin margin over NordVPN, thanks to its excellent privacy, transparency and usability. ExpressVPN added WireGuard VPN protocol support with postquantum protection just this month.\nIn July, ExpressVPN announced that its server network had been expanded to offer connection options in all 50 states. However, NordVPN once again emerged as the fastest VPN, posting a virtually unnoticeable 3% speed loss in our testing -- and with useful updates, including scam call protection on Android, Nord continues to impress. Surfshark offers similar privacy features and functionality to ExpressVPN and NordVPN at a substantially lower cost, especially when it comes to renewal prices. Mullvad and Proton are worthy privacy-focused competitors, offering similar pricing to Surfshark. PIA's high speed loss and constant CAPTCHAs led us to remove it from our top recommendations and list it as another option to consider instead.\nWhat is the best VPN in 2025?\nExpressVPN is the best VPN overall thanks to its streamlined apps, fast server speeds, excellent streaming service unblocking and strong privacy. All told, ExpressVPN is an outstanding VPN for beginners and privacy experts alike. Its intuitive apps are a breeze to use, and we appreciate ExpressVPN\u2019s forward-thinking approach to privacy. You'll even find servers across all 50 of the United States, making it a great choice for travel within the US and unblocking regional sports such as NFL games. However, ExpressVPN charges a premium for its service at $13 per month, $100 for the first year or $140 total for the first two years (the one- and two-year plans renew at $117 annually). While you do get some extra goodies bundled into your plan -- including a password manager and identity protection services -- we wish that ExpressVPN offered a cheaper basic package for people on a budget or who just want the VPN.\nNordVPN is an exceptional VPN that\u2019s extremely fast, great for streaming and packed with privacy features. Its connection speeds were the fastest we tested. Coupled with its extensive international server network and fantastic streaming service unblocking, Nord is one of the top VPNs for streaming. Plus, its massive global server footprint means NordVPN works well for travel. While NordVPN is initially a superb value at $13 per month, $60 for the first year or $83 total for the first two years, auto-renewal price hikes jack the cost up to an extortionate $140 annually on the one- and two-year plans. So we recommend monitoring your subscription to avoid a costly price increase. In July 2025, NordVPN released scam call protection on Android, making it an even more attractive mobile VPN.\nSurfshark is a great choice for folks seeking unique privacy features on a budget. It offers connection speeds and features comparable to ExpressVPN and NordVPN, but at an annual rate that's considerably cheaper at $48 for the first year or $60 total for the first two years (then $79 a year after the promotional period for both the one- and two-year plans). Surfshark gives you unlimited simultaneous connections, a benefit that most pricier competitors lack, including ExpressVPN and NordVPN. Despite its relative affordability in comparison with VPN rivals, Surfshark packs a privacy punch, offering unique features like split tunneling on MacOS and Dynamic MultiHop. Still, Surfshark doesn't quite match ExpressVPN's commitment to privacy, making it less suitable for people with critical privacy needs.\nMullvad VPN is the most private VPN. While you'll find the privacy basics, Mullvad goes above and beyond what most VPNs provide. Its unique privacy approach means you don't need to give the company any personal information if you don't want to -- not even an email address -- and you can even pay with cash. All of its apps are open-source, meaning anyone can inspect its source code for bugs or vulnerabilities. What's more, Mullvad's transparency extends to its pricing -- you'll pay 5 euros per month (about $6) whether you sign up for one month, one year or more with no price hikes at all. If you're seriously concerned about privacy, Mullvad is the VPN for you.\nProton VPN is the most versatile VPN on the market. It's privacy-forward, with neat features such as discreet app icons on Android to disguise your VPN app as a notes, weather or calculator app. An obfuscation-focused VPN protocol focuses on masking your VPN connection as standard web traffic to slip through firewalls. But Proton VPN works equally well for casual users seeking an excellent VPN for streaming -- it even unblocks tough-to-access regional content like Netflix Egypt. At $10 per month, $60 for the first year or $108 total for the first two years (the one- and two-year plans renew at $80 annually), Proton is a great value.\nEach VPN service we recommend has excellent value for a specific use case, and we point out the ideal customer for each one. The array of options available means there's a VPN service suited to your needs, whether your privacy needs are casual or critical. Also, consider jumping on one of the best VPN deals currently available, which many of our top picks are offering.\nVPN feature comparison: See how our top picks stack up\n| ExpressVPN | NordVPN | Surfshark | Proton VPN | Mullvad | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Best | Overall | For power users | Value | Versatility | Privacy |\n| Price | $13 per month, $100 for the first year or $140 total for the first two years (one- and two-year plans renew at $117 per year) | $13 per month, $60 for a year or $83 for two years (one- and two-year plans auto-renew at $140 a year) | $15 per month, $48 the first year or $60 total for the first two years (one- and two-year plans renew at $79 per year) | $10 per month, $60 for a year or $108 for two years (one- and two-year plans auto-renew at $80 a year) | $6 |\n| Server network | 3,000-plus servers in 105 countries | 8,000-plus servers in 126 countries | 3,200-plus servers in 100 countries | 14,900-plus servers in 122 countries | 730 servers in 49 countries |\n| Free plan available | No | No | No | Yes | No |\n| Money-back guarantee | 30 days; 7-day free trial available in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store | 30 days | 30 days | 30 days | 14 days |\n| Average internet speed loss | 18% | 3% | 21% | 16% | 24% |\n| Simultaneous connections | 8 | 10 | Unlimited | 10 | 5 |\n| Jurisdiction | British Virgin Islands | Panama | Netherlands | Switzerland | Sweden |\n| Part of the 5, 9 or 14 Eyes data-sharing alliances? | No | No | Yes | No | Yes |\n| Kill switch | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Split tunneling | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Audited no-logs policy | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Double VPN/multi-hop | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Torrenting support | Yes (all servers) | Yes (dedicated P2P servers) | Yes (all servers) | Yes (dedicated P2P servers) | Yes (all servers) |\n| Streaming support | Netflix, HBO Max, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer, CBC and more | Netflix, HBO Max, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer, CBC and more | Netflix, HBO Max, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer, CBC and more | Netflix, HBO Max, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, BBC iPlayer, CBC and more | Netflix, HBO Max |\n| Unblocks regional content reliably | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |\n| Supported platforms | Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, Android TV, iOS, iPadOS, Apple TV, Fire TV, web browsers, routers | Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, Android TV, iOS, iPadOS, Apple TV, Fire TV, web browsers, routers | Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, Android TV, iOS, iPadOS, Apple TV, Fire TV, web browsers, routers | Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, Android TV, iOS, iPadOS, Fire TV, Apple TV, web browsers, routers | Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android, Android TV, iOS, iPadOS, Fire TV, web browsers, routers |\nFactors to consider in a VPN\nWhen shopping for a virtual private network, you'll need to figure out the best VPN for your needs and budget. Here's what to look for.\nInternet speed loss\nVPNs somewhat lower your internet speed because you're routing your traffic through an encrypted server before communicating with apps, websites and other internet services rather than a direct connection. The fastest VPNs feature an average download speed loss of 25% or less. Generally, even folks with slower connections -- like satellite internet -- won't notice a marginal 25% or under dip. For bandwidth-intensive applications like gaming, 4K video streaming or uploading large files, you'll want a VPN with minimal speed loss. Casual users with faster internet speeds should be fine with more than 25% speed loss, but we look for VPNs that keep speed loss below 50%.\nIn our 2025 testing, NordVPN came out on top with an impressively low 3% average internet speed loss. Mullvad, Surfshark, Proton VPN and ExpressVPN all clocked an average internet download speed loss of 25% or less.\nThis table shows the speeds we experienced in our testing. Your speeds will vary depending on factors like your internet service plan and connection type. The percentage of speed lost is intended as a general indicator of how much the VPN slows down your connection; lower numbers represent a faster overall connection.\n| Provider | Speed loss |\n|---|---|\n| NordVPN | 3% |\n| Proton VPN | 16% |\n| ExpressVPN | 18% |\n| Surfshark | 21% |\n| Mullvad | 24% |\nPrivacy\nVPNs bolster your privacy by masking your public IP address, which -- like your physical address -- contains identifying information about your geographical location. So when you connect to the internet while having a VPN enabled, your public IP address is hidden from your ISP, as well as apps you use and websites you visit. But the best VPNs provide robust privacy protections. At a minimum, we recommend a VPN with 256-bit encryption (for OpenVPN and IKEv2 VPN protocols) or ChaCha20 (with WireGuard), a strict no-logging policy and DNS leak protection. Because logging is tough to verify, look for regular third-party audits. You can and should be skeptical of your VPN provider's zero-log claims. Still, VPN audits are important even if they don't provide the full privacy picture.\nAdditionally, transparency reports offer peace of mind. We also suggest sticking with a VPN that includes a kill switch, which shuts your internet off in case your VPN unexpectedly disconnects. For granular control over your VPN connection, you may want split tunneling, which lets you use a VPN for some apps and websites but not others. For instance, you can use split tunneling to route your Netflix app through a VPN to unblock foreign content libraries while excluding your Google Chrome browser to avoid CAPTCHAs when logging into your email.\nMore privacy-concerned folks like investigative journalists or political activists will appreciate advanced features such as obfuscation (which makes it harder for ISPs to determine that you're using a VPN), Tor over VPN (for additional encryption using the Tor network) and a double VPN (which relies on a second VPN server connection to enhance encryption). Folks with critical privacy needs should consider a VPN provider with jurisdiction outside of the Five, Nine or Fourteen Eyes intelligence-sharing communities for even stronger peace of mind. Whether you're just curious or you suspect your VPN isn't working, you may want to perform a VPN test.\nServer network\nWhen considering VPN server networks, look at the overall number of servers, as well as the individual country locations. For instance, one virtual private network company may have twice the total number of servers as a competitor but half the different country locations, meaning you've got fewer international choices. At the high end, the best VPNs for travel offer 90-plus individual countries, but anywhere over 60 countries will work for many folks.\nOutside of country locations, some VPNs allow file sharing across all servers, whereas others feature dedicated P2P (peer-to-peer) options. For purposes like torrenting, check whether your desired provider permits file sharing on all servers or select ones.\nAdditionally, you'll sometimes find specialty servers, like Tor (The Onion Router) over VPN, Double VPN or obfuscated servers. Onion over VPN and Double VPN servers provide extra privacy by bolstering your encryption even further when compared with a standard VPN connection, with Tor using the Onion network while a double VPN relies on a second VPN tunnel. On the other hand, obfuscated servers make it more difficult for apps, websites or internet service providers to determine that you're using a VPN.\nDevice support\nThink about your devices and what you'd like to run a VPN on so that you can check for an available virtual private network app. Most virtual private network services offer apps for Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android/Android TV, iOS/iPadOS and web browsers. Apple TV apps are increasingly common, with ExpressVPN, Surfshark, Proton VPN, PIA, NordVPN, PrivadoVPN and IPVanish featuring TVOS applications.\nA graphical user interface application may be easier for Linux users than a command-line interface option. ExpressVPN, NordVPN, Surfshark, Proton and PIA boast Linux GUI apps, making them compelling choices for Linux VPNs. Windows for Arm support is available with some VPNs, including NordVPN, Surfshark, Proton VPN, ExpressVPN and PIA. You can typically install a VPN on your router for whole-home coverage and use it on devices that don't support native VPN apps, like Xbox consoles, although this will typically void the warranty on the router.\nMost VPN companies let you install an app on as many gadgets as you wish, but you're sometimes limited to simultaneous devices. ExpressVPN allows eight, while NordVPN and Proton give you 10. Surfshark, PIA and IPVanish are unlimited. Even with a provider like Express, Proton or Nord, you can still install a VPN on as many devices as you wish, but you'll be able to have only a handful of active sessions at once. Most folks should be fine even with eight to 10 simultaneous connections, but families or hardcore power users may feel constrained. If you've got a lot of gadgets you want to install a VPN on, you may want to consider one of the best VPNs for multiple devices, including Surfshark, NordVPN, PIA and ExpressVPN.\nVPN device compatibility\nWondering which VPN services work on which devices? We've got you covered.\n| ExpressVPN | NordVPN | Surfshark | ProtonVPN | Mullvad | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Windows (x86 and Arm) | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f |\n| MacOS | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f |\n| Linux | \u2714\ufe0f (with GUI) | \u2714\ufe0f (with GUI) | \u2714\ufe0f (with GUI) | \u2714\ufe0f (with GUI) | \u2714\ufe0f (with GUI) |\n| Android/AndroidTV | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f |\n| iOS/iPadOS | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f |\n| Fire TV | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f |\n| Smart TV* | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f |\n| Apple TV | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f |\n| Router | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f |\n| Browser plugin** | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f | \u2714\ufe0f |\n| Simultaneous connections | 8 | 10 | Unlimited | 10 | 5 |\n*Smart television sets running Google TV/Android TV or Fire TV can download VPN apps directly, while LG's webOS, Samsung's Tizen OS and Roku TVs require a router VPN.\n**For Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Microsoft Edge, Opera and Vivaldi.\nStreaming capabilities\nVPNs can be great for privacy. They're also helpful for unblocking region-restricted entertainment content. A VPN lets you stream services like Peacock (for NFL games), Max or Hulu from your home country while traveling abroad. Conversely, VPNs also unlock access to foreign libraries on platforms like Netflix (to watch Wednesday), Disney Plus (for Marvel's latest shows) and Amazon Prime Video (currently featuring Reacher). You may even be able to save money by using a VPN for streaming. For more info, check out the best VPNs for Amazon Prime Video and the best VPNs for streaming.\nCost\nWith most VPNs, you can buy virtual private network service on a monthly, bi-annual, annual or multi-year plan. Although multi-year deals typically net you the most savings, we usually recommend sticking with an annual plan for the best savings with the lowest risk. The virtual private network you sign up for may initially be fast, private and great for geo-unblocking, but may become slower, suffer a data breach or stop allowing access to foreign Netflix libraries over a year.\nOn the high end, VPNs such as Express cost around $100 per year, with value-packed providers like Surfshark and PIA offering introductory year-long prices from $40 to $48. Some companies include price hikes: NordVPN normally charges $60 annually for your first year, then your plan renews at $140 per 12 months. Similarly, Surfshark goes for $48 a year upfront, then renews at $79 annually. Make a budget, then find a VPN provider that fits the bill while being mindful of price hikes. Notably, there are plenty of ways to save money on your VPN subscription, like avoiding raised renewal rates by taking advantage of seasonal discounts like Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals. If you're on a budget, you may want to consider one of the best cheap VPNs, like Surfshark, PIA or Mullvad.\nAdditional VPN factors to consider when selecting the best VPN for your needs and budget\nDon't use free VPN providers: Except for Proton -- the best free VPN on the market -- you'll find only paid VPN options on this list because they're the only ones we recommend.\nLook for a no-logs VPN but understand the caveats: The best VPNs keep as few logs as possible and make them as anonymous as possible, so there's little data to provide should authorities come knocking. Even \"no-logs\" VPNs aren't 100% anonymous.\nThere are limits to the privacy VPNs currently provide to iOS users: Recent independent research has surfaced suggesting iPhones and iPads running iOS 14 or later may be vulnerable to device-only VPN leaks, regardless of which VPN is used. Apple users concerned with potential leaks can take extra precautions by installing their VPN on a home router to ensure their entire Wi-Fi network is encrypted. Some iOS users may potentially reduce the likelihood of leaks while outside of a home network by enabling their VPN's kill switch and selecting OpenVPN protocols. You can also try closing all apps, activating your VPN and then enabling and disabling Airplane Mode before using your device normally. Apple advises users to activate their device's Always On VPN profile for additional protection.\nVPN transparency is important, but warrant canaries are only the beginning: Many services use \"warrant canaries\" to passively note to the public whether or not they've been subpoenaed by a government entity. This is because many investigations from national security agencies can't be actively disclosed by law. Like the no-logging issue, warrant canaries aren't always as straightforward as they seem. You should spend more time investigating whether your prospective VPN has cooperated with authorities in the past, and how and when it's disclosed that fact.\nThink twice about using a US-based VPN: The Patriot Act is still the law of the land in the US, and that means US-based VPNs have little recourse if and when the feds show up with subpoenas or national security letters in hand demanding access to servers, VPN user accounts or other data. Yes, they may have little data to access if the service has a strong no-logs policy, but why not just choose a service that's based outside Uncle Sam's jurisdiction? (If this is a concern for you, you'll also want to avoid countries with which the US has intelligence-sharing agreements.)\nVPN speed test data\nAlthough VPN speeds aren't the only important criteria, you'll need a virtual private network provider with fast speeds. If all servers severely hinder your internet speeds, then streaming, browsing the web or hopping on Zoom calls may be be frustrating. Here's how VPN provider speeds stacked up.\nAbout VPNs\nA virtual private network enhances your privacy by masking your public IP address, which is similar to your home address in that it provides your general geographical location. With a VPN enabled, your internet service provider or mobile carrier can't tell what apps you use or websites you visit, so you can hide your internet browsing and app activity or torrent privately. Because VPNs encrypt your web traffic by routing it through secure servers, you can make it appear as though you're connecting from a different city, state or country, which lets you unblock geographically restricted content, meaning you can access foreign Netflix libraries to watch content like Wednesday, watch movies and shows like EastEnders on BBC iPlayer outside of the UK and stream regional or international sports matches, like NFL or soccer games.\nVPNs are also nifty for travel because you can access services like email from your home country while abroad for a summer vacation without dealing with annoying CAPTCHAs. Because of their diverse applications, VPNs are excellent additions to your app arsenal.\nThe best VPNs offer robust privacy protections without compromising on performance, notably internet speeds. At CNET, we rigorously test each VPN across all major platforms to determine the ones that provide exceptional privacy, reliability, speed, streaming service unblocking and value. We actively test VPNs and review the latest research, so expect this guide to change as we put each VPN through its paces. We've recently retested ExpressVPN, NordVPN, Surfshark, Proton VPN, Private Internet Access and Mullvad from the ground up, and are in the process of retesting IPVanish, CyberGhost and PrivadoVPN.\nHow we test VPNs\nOur hands-on testing and review process is designed to cut through the hype and determine the best VPNs of the bunch. When we look at each VPN service, we're not just examining them for their technical weaknesses, but we're also scrutinizing their individual performance strengths in various areas, like privacy, streaming or value for the money. We want to know what each service does best. We test each VPN across over 20 factors, and we continually improve our methodology as we learn more. Our rigorous testing process involves running over 250 internet speed tests across multiple worldwide servers to determine accurate internet speed loss averages.\nWe test VPNs for browsing and streaming speed in multiple countries, as well as their connection stability and even the smallest potential privacy leaks. By testing across multiple devices and platforms, we're able to assess which VPNs are best for gaming versus those best for streaming, torrenting or sharing sensitive information. Most importantly, we focus on doing the deep-dive research necessary to vet each VPN's historical credibility and its ownership in a notoriously murky market.\nThe VPNs on this list earn our recommendation for more than just boosting their digital privacy strengths -- they enable easy streaming to overcome geo-blocked media, have torrenting-friendly servers and are fast enough to support gaming globally. Based on those continued evaluations, you'll see a few bullet points on each entry in our list, highlighting each VPN's strengths and the uses we recommend it for most. Because we strive to keep on top of a fast-changing market, you'll notice that the rank of each VPN service changes as we learn more and retest.\nHow to choose the right VPN for you\nPicking the best VPN requires knowing two basic things to start with: What you want to use it for, and what you're willing to pay. The range of VPN offerings is vast, but those two things will help you find a VPN that has the right blend of speed, security and cost.\nBelow, you'll find specific FAQ sections on picking a VPN based on the most common needs: gaming, streaming media, working from home and privacy-critical professions. In general, you'll want a VPN that provides sufficient encryption, doesn't log your activity, offers essential security features like DNS leak protection and a kill switch, has server locations where you need them and can give you fast connection speeds. Our top five VPNs have all these features, although connection speeds will vary based on your internet provider and the server you connect to.\nFor a deeper dive, check our detailed walk-through of how we evaluate and review VPNs. If you're looking for some quick pointers, here are universally applicable advice guides for beginners:\nWhat to look forward to in late 2025\nThe biggest change we're seeing is that VPN companies have started going beyond just offering VPNs, and are striving to be one-stop cybersecurity shops by including services like password managers, antivirus software and identity theft protection in bundles. Many of our top VPN picks now let you bundle antivirus software, password managers and identity theft protection services. There are pros and cons to bundling. On the one hand, it may be more convenient to have one bill rather than several to keep track of, and it might also be more cost-effective. However, on the other hand, you might end up paying for services you don't use, and it may be cumbersome to transfer out of that ecosystem in the event of a data breach or price increase.\nAll of our top-rated VPNs now offer user-friendly Linux graphical user interface apps, which is refreshing since it makes using a VPN on Linux more accessible, particularly for beginners. With an increased concern about threats from quantum computing, like hacking, providers are adding postquantum resistance to VPN apps. In 2025, NordVPN added postquantum protection to all of its apps, joining ExpressVPN and Mullvad in providing quantum-resistant encryption. In July 2025, ExpressVPN announced that it had servers in all 50 states, making it a great choice for traveling to and within the US, as well as unblocking regional sports streaming matches, like NFL or NWSL games. Also in July 2025, NordVPN rolled out scam call protection on Android. We expect that server rosters will continue to grow throughout 2025, and that VPN providers will keep offering additional cybersecurity features in addition to VPNs, whether as part of base VPN plans or as bundles.\nOther VPNs we've tested\nNot every VPN can be a favorite. These are the ones we reviewed, but they're not full-throated recommendations for one reason or another, including limited features and concerns over adequately hiding your identity, ultimately falling short to other picks we selected as the best VPNs. In addition to the more recently tested VPNs below, we also looked at Hotspot Shield and TunnelBear a few years ago and were left disappointed at the time.\nPrivate Internet Access is a budget-friendly VPN that undercuts most of the competition at $12 per month, $40 for the first year (renewing at $50 annually) or $79 total for three years. It\u2019s privacy-forward with open-source apps, meaning anyone can inspect the source code for vulnerabilities or bugs, and one of the most reader-friendly privacy policies we\u2019ve encountered. PIA was largely good for streaming service unblocking, letting us watch Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus, BBC iPlayer, Max and a slew of other sites. It\u2019s suitable for international and US domestic travel -- you\u2019ll get 35,000 servers in 91 countries, including servers in all 50 of the United States. PIA is a compelling choice if you want to stream regional US sports, like NFL games.\nWhile PIA largely sticks to the privacy basics, its highly customizable VPN apps should satisfy power users who want lots of control over VPN connections. Apple users will appreciate split tunneling on MacOS -- a rarity among VPN providers that few providers besides PIA and Surfshark include.\nHowever, PIA\u2019s sluggish server speeds make it unsuitable for folks with slower or more unreliable internet connections. We clocked an underwhelming 49% average internet speed loss in our 2025 speed testing. That might be fine if you\u2019re using Google Fiber or cable, like Spectrum, but satellite internet users should opt for a faster VPN. Moreover, we encountered a lot of CAPTCHAs using PIA, even when trying to perform a basic Google search. For a little more money, you can get a lot more value with faster speeds and more advanced privacy features by opting for a VPN like Surfshark or Proton.\n- Servers: 35,000-plus\n- Number of countries: 91\n- Country/jurisdiction: US\n- Platforms: Windows, MacOS, Linux (GUI), Android, Android TV, iOS, iPadOS, Fire TV, Apple TV, browsers, routers\n- Price: $12 per month, $40 for the first year (then $50 annually) or $79 total for three years\nIPVanish is a decent beginner-friendly VPN for folks seeking basic privacy. It does a good job of unblocking geographically protected streaming content on multiple services, such as providing access to foreign Netflix libraries (IPVanish is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis). We liked its intuitive VPN apps which, while easy to use even for novices, weren't quite as streamlined as apps from NordVPN or ExpressVPN. While you get privacy fundamentals from IPVanish, its US jurisdiction makes it unsuitable for people with critical privacy needs, like political activists, investigative journalists or asylum-seekers.\nIts comparatively slow speeds -- we measured a 44% average internet speed loss -- severely lagged behind NordVPN (11%), Surfshark (17%), Proton VPN (21%) and ExpressVPN (25%). But its servers peppering 108 countries mean you get an international reach close to NordVPN (126 countries), ExpressVPN (105) countries, Surfshark (100 countries), Proton (122 countries) and PIA (91 countries). IPVanish sets you back $13 per month, $40 for your first year or $53 for two years combined -- but the one- and two-year plans jump to $156 annually (the two-year tier renews at $312 total for two years of service, which breaks down to $156 a year paid upfront) after your introductory pricing period. For the price, you can get a VPN with faster internet speed maintenance.\n- Servers: 2,400-plus\n- Number of countries: 108\n- Country/jurisdiction: US\n- Platforms: Windows, MacOS, Linux (CLI), Chrome OS, Android, Android TV, iOS, iPadOS, Fire TV, Apple TV\n- Price: $13 per month, $40 for the first year (then $156 annually) or $52 for the first two years combined (then $312 total for two years of service)\nIf you need a VPN with a massive number of servers in tons of different locations, or if you\u2019re a streaming enthusiast who likes to stream a wide variety of streaming content, then CyberGhost is a serviceable choice for casual use cases. If you\u2019re a journalist, activist, dissident, physician, attorney or anyone else with critical privacy needs looking for a solid privacy-focused VPN, you won\u2019t find it in CyberGhost.\nWe like that CyberGhost publishes extremely detailed quarterly transparency reports (far outdoing all other VPNs in terms of detail and frequency) and operates a RAM-only server infrastructure, but the company\u2019s overall approach to user privacy needs some major attention. CyberGhost\u2019s privacy policy outlines some questionable data-sharing practices, and we were perplexed by how the VPN\u2019s website and onboarding process reinforces the dangerous falsehood that VPNs can make you totally anonymous online. We were also disappointed to see how CyberGhost attempts to trick users into agreeing to share additional data with the company through its apps.\nBesides CyberGhost\u2019s dubious approach to user privacy, the VPN\u2019s apps are a mess. Throughout our testing process, we ran into numerous bugs and choppy performance on nearly all of CyberGhost\u2019s apps across the platforms we tested. In our testing, all of CyberGhost\u2019s apps consistently took an abnormally long time to connect to a server. At times, the apps would become entirely unresponsive, requiring an app restart and sometimes even a full system restart. CyberGhost\u2019s apps also don\u2019t offer much in the way of helpful bonus features like many others, including Surfshark and NordVPN, do. If you need a fast VPN, you\u2019ll probably be disappointed by CyberGhost\u2019s mediocre speed performance (30% speed lost in CNET\u2019s testing).\nOverall, CyberGhost is a sub-par VPN provider with buggy apps, middling speed performance and questionable privacy practices. It costs $13 per month, $42 every six months or $57 for the first 24 months (then $57 annually). For a similar price or even cheaper, you can choose several VPNs that are far superior to CyberGhost.\n- Number of servers: 11,500-plus\n- Number of countries: 100-plus\n- Jurisdiction: Romania, with UK parent company\n- Platforms: Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, iPadOS, Android, Android TV, Fire TV\n- $13 per month, $42 every six months, $57 for the first two years (then $57 annually)\nNorton LifeLock, long known for excellence in security products, has a relatively limited offering in its VPN product. Norton Secure VPN does not support P2P or BitTorrent, Linux, routers or set-top boxes. It's Netflix and streaming compatibility is somewhat limited. Even worse, during testing, we experienced privacy-compromising data leaks.\nDuring CNET's testing, Norton Secure VPN speeds were comparable to other midtier VPNs but not particularly competitive. Although its VPN is only available on four platforms -- Mac, iOS, Windows and Android -- Norton gets points for its 24/7 live customer service phone support and 60-day money-back guarantee.\nNorton Secure VPN costs $40 for the first year, rising to $80 upon renewal. For that price, you get protection for five devices, which is well below ExpressVPN's eight simultaneous devices, Nord and Proton's 10 or Surshark and PIA's unlimited. Most VPN providers let you install a VPN on as many devices as you like but limit your simultaneous usage, Norton restricts how many total devices you can download a VPN on. This stingy device allowance is well under the competition. If you need more, you can always upgrade to Norton's Ultra VPN Plus with its 10-device policy. Norton Secure VPN Plus and Ultra VPN Plus bundle antivirus software, so if you need a VPN with antivirus, it's a consideration.\n- Number of servers: 2,000-plus\n- Number of countries: 60-plus\n- Country/jurisdiction: US\n- Platforms: Windows, MacOS, Android, iOS, iPadOS\n- Price: $40 for the first year for 5 devices (renews at $80), $50 for the first year with Norton antivirus for 5 devices (renews at $110) or $60 for the first year for 10 devices including antivirus (renews at $130)\nPrivadoVPN is a decent no-frills VPN provider. Its free plan limits your monthly usage to 10GB, but you can pick from servers in 13 cities. By contrast, Proton VPN doesn't limit your data consumption, but you can't choose a server manually. You won't get the fastest internet download and upload speeds or the largest server network with its paid tiers, but Privado is a solid VPN for streaming.\nPrivado has privacy-friendly Swiss jurisdiction, but it hasn't been audited. All of its privacy features work, including split tunneling, DNS leak protection and a kill switch, although its kill switch was almost too aggressive, keeping your internet cut off even after manually disconnecting from a server or closing the PrivadoVPN app. Because of its lack of audits, it's hard to recommend Privado for privacy-conscious users, like investigative journalists, political activists, asylum-seekers or even worried torrenters. Privado is one of the best VPNs for casual users, with a premium plan available as a convenient upgrade path.\n- Number of servers: Hundreds\n- Number of countries: 50\n- Country/jurisdiction: Switzerland\n- Platforms: Windows, MacOS, Android, Android TV, iOS, iPadOS, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Linux, routers\n- Price: Free, $8 per month, $20 for the first year (then $60 annually) or $30 total for the first two years (then $96 total for two years)\nBest VPN FAQs\nIn today's hyperconnected world, online privacy and security are increasingly critical. From online banking to communicating remotely with colleagues, we're transferring more data on our computers and smartphones than ever before. Much of that data is confidential information that we need to keep safe from hackers and snoops, so VPN use is on the rise as people take steps to secure their digital lives."

He tests, reviews and writes about the latest TVs and audio equipment. When he's not playing Call of Duty he's eating whatever cuisine he can get his hands on. He has a cat named after one of the best TVs ever made.\nExpertiseTy has worked for radio, print, and online publications, and has been writing about home entertainment since 2004. He is an avid record collector and streaming music enthusiast.Credentials\nTy was nominated for Best New Journalist at the Australian IT Journalism awards, but he has only ever won one thing. As a youth, he was awarded a free session for the photography studio at a local supermarket.\nEditor's note, Aug. 6, 2024: Since this review was written, Sling TV has increased the cost of Sling Blue to $45 and Sling Orange to $40, while Sling Orange & Blue has become $60. Due to ongoing changes in the competitive marketplace, we have removed the Editors' Choice award and will update this review as soon as possible. The following is as it originally ran on Sept. 21, 2021.\nNo local channels beyond NBC and Fox in a few cities\nPackage options can be confusing\nLimited DVR\nAirTV channels don't work on browsers or Apple TV\nLive TV streaming services and streaming devices are designed to replace cable TV by letting you stream live channels over the internet. Yet for the budget-conscious TV viewer, not all services are created equal: For instance, YouTube TV offers a lot of channels but it costs twice as much as the cord-cutter-friendly Sling TV. Starting at $35, Sling TV offers an excellent value with plenty of channels on offer, and it finally looks the business with its new coat of paint.\nSling TV is different from rivals because it offers two main plans for the same $35 entry price: Sling Orange and Sling Blue. They share many of the same channels (like CNN, History and TNT) but others are exclusive to one or the other. Sling TV Blue is essentially the Fox and NBC option, while Sling Orange is the ESPN and Disney package.\nIn January this year, Sling TV increased the price on its two main packages from $30 to $35 while also increasing the DVR storage to 50 hours (up from 10). Existing customers got to keep their $30 price until Aug. 1 but now pay the same as newer patrons.\nDespite its lack of local channels Sling TV remains my favorite affordable live TV streamer for the money, and the Blue plan in particular is a great deal. Even with that slight price bump you can still save money compared to cable, and Sling TV Blue remains the CNET Editors' Choice as the best budget live TV streaming service.\nSling TV is a subscription service that lets you stream a selection of TV channels live over the internet. The channels are just like the ones offered by cable and satellite TV, but Sling has fewer of them and costs less money every month. You can watch Sling TV on televisions using the Sling TV app on media streamers (like Roku, Amazon Fire TV), smart TV systems LG and Samsung) and game consoles (Xbox Series S and X), as well as to phones, tablets and computers, no cable box required.\nSling TV was the first of its kind, having debuted in 2016, but it now has a bunch of competitors at different prices, including Hulu Plus Live TV, YouTube TV, DirecTV Stream, Philo and FuboTV. For ease of categorization, I've separated these services into budget ($35 and under) and premium (over $50) services. Even with this year's price hike, Sling TV can still be considered a budget service, alongside the $25 Philo (as of Sept. 21, 2021).\nOf the two $35 tiers, I believe Sling Blue offers the best deal for most people. It has more channels than Orange and allows up to three people to watch different streams at once, while Sling Orange only allows one stream at a time. You can combine the two Blue and Orange services for $55 a month, but you're only getting five more \"top\" channels than Blue (though this does include ESPN and ESPN 2). If you're already paying that much, then FuboTV ($65) or YouTube TV ($65) are better options as they offer way more channels (including locals) and improved DVRs.\nSling is also the only live TV service to offer a bunch of add-on channel packages. You can pay $5 or $10 monthly for packages such as Sports Extra, Comedy Extra, Hollywood Extra, The Best of Spanish TV and more. The channels in each vary depending on whether you have Blue or Orange, and some channels (like Animal Planet and Nickelodeon) are missing completely, but between its Extras and multiple base packages, Sling offers more ways to customize your channel lineup than any of its competitors.\nSling stays inexpensive by eschewing most local channels. The Blue package has Fox and/or NBC in a handful of major cities but doesn't include any ABC or CBS stations. The Orange package offers no local channels, period. As any cord-cutter knows, local channels are also available by connecting an HD antenna to the back of your television. Sling TV offers another option, however: the AirTV series of over-the-air streamers. The AirTVs connect to an antenna and your network and streams any local channels you receive into the Sling TV interface, integrating them right into Sling's program guide and other areas. You can also connect an external hard drive to the AirTV to record over-the-air channels. Other OTA DVRs are available too, although no others feed into Sling's interface.\nWhether you use an AirTV or not, Sling includes a cloud DVR for free that allows you to record almost any streaming channel on the service (the only exceptions are Local Now, ESPN3, ACC Network Extra and SEC Network Plus). It comes with 50 hours of storage but the free version won't let you protect your recorded shows. You have to pay an additional $5 a month for 200 hours of storage and the ability to prevent recordings from becoming automatically erased.\nWhat's Sling TV like to use?\nUntil now, the user interface has been the worst part of the experience, it simply lacked the sophistication of its rivals. The new menu system looks similar to Disney Plus in that it organizes your content horizontally on the left hand side. While the previous interface had way too many options, the menu has now been whittled down to Search, Home, Guide DVR and On-Demand. It's more aesthetically pleasing in addition to being easier to use.\nRegardless of which version you are using -- new or old -- navigation is zippy, and I found it was easy to find the shows I wanted to watch and record. With the multiple discovery screens, including the main Home screen, there was plenty of programming available even when I didn't know what I was in the mood for.\nSling has made numerous upgrades to its cloud DVR since launch, such as the bump to 50 hours of recording space. In addition it now allows you to record and live-pause channels you couldn't before, including the Disney and ESPN channels bundled with the Orange packages. Of course, there's also its...\nIntegration with AirTV\nWhile they're not the most elegant OTA solutions I've seen, the AirTV 2 and higher-end AirTV Anywhere are still solid options for integrating local channels into Sling TV. They will let users tune in to all of the available channels in the area and, in my own tests in New York, I was able to view and record 75-plus different stations.\nWhile the AirTV Anywhere incorporates four tuners and an integrated 1 terabyte drive, the AirTV 2 requires a compatible external hard drive to turn it into a DVR. The company says, \"Hard drives must be larger than 50GB, AirTV 2 currently supports recording up to 2TB of storage for DVR.\" I connected a WD 2TB Elements Portable without issue.\nWatch this: Live TV streaming services for cord cutters: How to choose the best one for you\nDuring my initial tests with the AirTV 2 I was unable to pause live TV, and while I am unable to test the device again, I can confirm that the AirTV Anywhere will enable you to freeze the action for up to 60 minutes.\nThe AirTV recorders have one main limitation that stunt their usefulness, however. The AirTV doesn't work on Apple TV or via a browser -- you won't be able to see any of the OTA channels or watch any of the recordings provided by AirTV. To use the tuner, you'll need to use the Sling TV app on Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Android TV, iOS or Android, or via the AirTV mini or AirTV player.\nAlso, be aware that the AirTV can't record streaming channels, just local ones, and so you're still limited to either the 50- or 200-hour recording times there.\nSetup of the AirTV devices has also been streamlined and users can now access them from within the Sling TV app's settings: It's called Over the Air Channels. There is no longer any need to download a separate app.\nShould you subscribe to Sling TV?\nWhile you can save some money with Philo ($25), it is definitely worth spending a bit more on Sling TV Blue. The upgrade to the DVR alone makes even the recent $5 upcharge seem justified, especially when other rivals cost almost twice as much. The experience is better than Philo overall; it's zippier and it offers more channels. It's not perfect, but it's getting better as a cable replacement, and it should save you a chunk of change in the long term. In the absence of LoCast just be sure to have a local channel contingency in place before you start.\nThe chart below compares the top 100 channels on Sling to its two budget rivals as well as YouTube TV. \"Yes\" means the channel is available on the cheapest pricing tier, \"No\" means the channel isn't available at all on that service and \"$\" means the channel is available for an extra fee, either a la carte or as part of a more expensive package or add-on."

      "text": "Pros\n- Solid mix of channels\n- Fun to use\n- Hulu's on-demand, Disney Plus and ESPN Plus included\n- Unlimited DVR\nCons\n- YouTube TV has a stronger live channel selection\nFor $10 a month, a basic Hulu on-demand subscription is a competitive streaming deal. It offers an extensive collection of both current and past TV shows and movies. But if you're craving even more content, Hulu Plus Live TV is the way to go. You get a healthy mix of live sports, news and local channels, plus Hulu's secret weapons: the ad-supported Disney bundle and an unlimited DVR. It's also eight times the price of the basic subscription at $83. That combination of live channels with Hulu and Disney and a deep on-demand catalog, however, is something no other live TV streaming service offers.\nPrices in live TV streaming change constantly, and Hulu competitor YouTube TV made one of its biggest jumps in years in 2023 to $73. The main advantage YouTube TV maintains over Hulu is a better live channel selection, but Hulu is supplemented by Disney and DVR upgrades. If you're looking for value, and especially if you already subscribe to Disney Plus, switching to Hulu Plus Live TV brings a wealth of content for one price.\nWhat do you get?\nHulu Plus Live TV expands upon the on-demand service with more than 90 live channels and throws in both a cloud DVR and program guide. Live TV is available via Hulu's standard app on all the major platforms, including computer browsers, iOS, Xbox, PlayStation, Android, Apple TV, Fire TV, Roku and smart TV systems.\nChannels: Hulu's channel count is solid but has a handful fewer major cable channels than YouTube TV. The service is missing popular channels AMC and BBC America, which every one of Hulu's competitors offers -- except Fubo. It now carries PBS stations which are available on YouTube TV. As a counterpoint to this, Hulu does offer the History Channel, MLB TV, Lifetime and A&E, none of which are on YouTube TV. However, the basic Hulu Plus Live TV package also includes ad-supported Disney Plus and ESPN Plus, which -- with the already-included Hulu -- is a $15 value on its own. If you want to skip the Disney Bundle, you can opt for the $82 plan or pay more to get the ad-free Disney Bundle included at $96 per month.\nRead more: A Guide to Streaming Your Favorite Live TV Channels Without Cable\nSports: Just like YouTube TV, Hulu has dropped many regional sports networks, so if you want MLB regular season games, your best bet is DirecTV Stream's $109 plan. The same goes for the NHL and NBA during those sports' regular seasons. If you're a football fan, though, the included NFL Network is a sweetener. For further channel inclusions, check the lineup at the end of this article, or our baseball guide below, to see if the Hulu Plus Live TV's mix is right for you.\nRead more: Best Sports Streaming Service of 2024\nPremium live TV streaming services compared\n| YouTube TV | Hulu with Live TV | DirecTV Stream | Fubo | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Monthly Price | $73 | $83 | $80 | $80 |\n| Total no. of top 100 channels | 78 | 75 | 57 | 46 |\n| ABC, CBS, etc.? | ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox | ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox | ABC, NBC, Fox, CBS | ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox |\n| RSNs | Limited | Limited | Yes | Yes |\n| Simultaneous streams | 3 | 2 (Pay an extra $10/month for more) | 20 at home (3 outside home) | 10 at home (2 outside home) |\n| Cloud DVR | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited | 1,000 hours |\nWhat it's like to use\nHulu has been tweaking its live TV interface ever since it launched, and the most recent changes have been the best. A large marquee and \"cover\" art features on the Home page, and shows are now arranged in a traditional grid according to type. Across most streaming devices, the sidebar of the Hulu interface has a simplified selection featuring Home, Live, TV, My Stuff (favorites and DVR recordings), TV, Movies, Sports and Hubs, which are essentially channels broken up by genre -- sports, movies and so on. You also have the ability to click on submenus for live programming that includes sports, news, kids and your favorite channels. In terms of user-friendliness, Hulu Plus Live TV is now in line with its biggest competitor, YouTube TV, but even more lovely to the eye.\nHulu's live programming guide is a traditional grid with guide data up to 14 days out. Scrolling through these pages is zippy, especially on an Apple TV. In comparison, YouTube TV's guide has undergone some recent improvements on streaming boxes, which means it's not only faster but now displays nine days in advance (up from a paltry 8 hours). However, the web version of YouTube TV is still painfully slow to navigate.\nAlso, there's a difference between the \"My Stuff\" and \"record\" options when you bring up an individual program's page. My Stuff is similar to the My List function on other streaming services -- adding a program bookmarks it -- while Record actually can record instances of it to your DVR (either one-offs or whole seasons). You can fast-forward and rewind ads on recorded material but not on shows from the catalog, such as your My Stuff tags.\nGetting recordings onto your DVR does involve a bit of a trick, though. You can't simply press \"record\" while watching a live program. Instead, you need to exit the guide, click on the program to access its page and then select the option to record. On phones, you can either select record on the program page or click on the title from the channel guide and hit record when the pop-up box appears (see below). Hulu also offers time-shift capabilities on live programs, including pause, rewind and fast-forward (though no ad-skipping is available).\nN.B. When setting up a new Hulu Plus Live TV account, be sure to check the option at the bottom that says, \"I'd like to pause, rewind and fast-forward Live TV, so I want Hulu to create temporary recordings.\" I have yet to get confirmation from Hulu, but it's unclear if you can do time-shifting if this box isn't checked.\nShould you get it?\nIf Hulu Plus Live TV's channels meet your needs and you subscribe to the services in the bundle already, Hulu Plus Live TV is a perfect fit. Its biggest trump card is its tight integration with the Hulu service (as well as Disney Plus and ESPN Plus). The interface is now a dressing on what was already a lovely window, especially with the zippy 14-day guide. It's has the priciest basic package of all the live TV streaming platforms, but the added perk of the Disney Bundle may make it a good fit for your viewing needs.\nThat said, YouTube TV offers a more robust, cable-like service for $10 less. And if you don't need as many channels or streaming local network affiliates (ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox), Sling TV Blue offers a much cheaper rate at $40-$45 a month, depending on your region.\nChannel comparison\nBelow you'll find a chart that's a smaller version of this massive channel comparison. It contains the top 100 channels from select services. Some notes:\n- Yes = The channel is available on the cheapest pricing tier.\n- No = The channel isn't available at all on that service.\n- $ = The channel is available for an extra fee, either a la carte or as part of a more expensive package or add-on.\n- Not every channel a service carries is listed, just the \"top 100\" as determined by CNET's editors. Minor channels such as AXS TV, CNBC World, Discovery Life, GSN, POP and Universal Kids didn't make the cut.\n- Regional sports networks -- channels devoted to showing regular-season games of particular pro baseball, basketball and hockey teams -- are not listed.\nTop 100 Channels Compared\n| Channel | Philo ($28) | Sling Orange ($40) | Sling Blue ($40) | YouTube TV ($73) | DirecTV Stream ($80) | Fubo ($80) | Hulu with Live TV ($83) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Total channels: | 42 | 24 | 35 | 78 | 61 | 46 | 75 |\n| ABC | No | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| CBS | No | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Fox | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| NBC | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| PBS | No | No | No | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |\n| CW | No | No | No | Yes | Yes (limited) | Yes | Yes |\n| MyNetworkTV | No | No | No | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |\n| Channel | Philo ($28) | Sling Orange ($40) | Sling Blue ($40) | YouTube TV ($73) | DirecTV Stream ($80) | Fubo ($80) | Hulu with Live TV ($83) |\n| A&E | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | $ | No | Yes |\n| ACC Network | No | $ | No | Yes | $ | Yes | Yes |\n| Accuweather | Yes | No | No | No | Yes | Yes | No |\n| AMC | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No |\n| Animal Planet | Yes | No | No | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |\n| BBC America | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No |\n| BBC World News | Yes | $ | $ | Yes | $ | No | No |\n| BET | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Big Ten Network | No | No | $ | Yes | $ | Yes | Yes |\n| Bloomberg TV | No | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Boomerang | No | $ | $ | No | Yes | No | $ |\n| Bravo | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Channel | Philo ($28) | Sling Orange ($40) | Sling Blue ($40) | YouTube TV ($73) | DirecTV Stream ($80) | Fubo ($80) | Hulu with Live TV ($83) |\n| Cartoon Network | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |\n| CBS Sports Network | No | No | No | Yes | $ | Yes | Yes |\n| Cheddar | Yes | No | No | Yes | $ | Yes | Yes |\n| Cinemax | No | No | No | $ | $ | No | $ |\n| CMT | Yes | $ | $ | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| CNBC | No | No | $ | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| CNN | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |\n| Comedy Central | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Cooking Channel | Yes | $ | $ | No | $ | $ | $ |\n| Destination America | Yes | $ | $ | No | $ | $ | $ |\n| Discovery Channel | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |\n| Disney Channel | No | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Disney Junior | No | $ | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Disney XD | No | $ | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| E!

      "text": "Pros\n- Fans of soccer will find plenty to love\n- Quick and easy navigation, especially on Roku\n- Huge DVR storage and 4K content included\nCons\n- Lacks CNN, TNT, TBS and other Turner channels\n- YouTube TV and Hulu Live are better overall\nFor cord-cutters live TV streaming services like YouTube TV, Sling TV and Fubo have become replacements for cable. The selection of channels on these services is diverse, just as with cable, but Fubo differentiates itself from rivals with a sports-centric focus. But is it enough to compete against some strong contenders?\nAt $80 a month, Fubo still has a decent channel lineup, although it's the only service in its price range to lack major Turner networks including CNN, TNT and TBS. If you're a fan of soccer, however, this is the streaming service to get because no other competitor offers a more comprehensive list of games, or ways to find them, in both 4K and HD. Beyond soccer it's also one of the best sports streaming services, full stop.\nYet, all of the other services in this price range present stronger packages. Hulu Plus Live TV offers a wealth of on-demand content including Disney Plus, and YouTube TV has even more channels and a superior DVR. More crucially, DirecTV Stream has a competitive channel selection comparable to Fubo. Overall, while Fubo has kept evolving over the years it still remains a niche player in the live TV streaming arena.\nWhat is Fubo?\nFubo launched in January 2015 as a soccer (er, football) streaming service, but it has expanded its reach within live TV streaming to include channels for local networks, lifestyle, true crime, dramas and movies. In the past few years it has lost important channels such as CNN, TBS, Lifetime and A&E, but its origins are still apparent with dozens of sports-centric channels. Of our top 100 channels, though, Fubo has the lowest among all the premium services at 56, followed closely by DirecTV Stream at 57. Meanwhile, YouTube TV leads with 78.\nFubo offers a smattering of live 4K sports programming, and in the past this has included events as diverse as the Super Bowl and the Westminster Dog Show. Currently, the upcoming 4K events page lists a mix of English Premier League and NCAA basketball tournament, aka March Madness, but the service has plenty of non-4K too with the UEFA Europa League. See the next section for an in-depth rundown.\nFubo once offered a $65 starter package, but this has been phased out in favor of the $80 Pro plan, which comes with 4K, 1,000 hours of cloud DVR storage, 10 screens and a total of 196 channels. Move one level up to the $90 Elite plan, and you'll get a bunch of extra channels (though only two more from the top 100) along with the Pro plan's perks, like the DVR upgrade. It's a massive improvement from the paltry 30 hours of recording the service offered a few of years ago. The cloud DVRs on YouTube TV and Hulu Plus Live TV are unlimited, for what it's worth.\nTop services compared\n| Monthly price | Sports channels | RSNs? | Simultaneous streams | Cloud DVR | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Fubo | $80 for Pro plan (196 channels) | ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, ESPN FS1, FS2, Bally Sports | Yes | 10 at home (2 outside home) | 1,000 hours |\n| DirecTV Stream | $80 for Entertainment Package with basic sports (90+ channels); $109 for Choice plan with deluxe sports (125+ channels) | ESPN, ABC, NBC, Fox, CBS, TBS, TNT, F1, RSNs | Yes | 20 at home (3 outside home) | Unlimited |\n| Hulu with Live TV | $77 | ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, ESPN, TBS, TNT, FS1, FS2 | Limited | 2 (pay an extra $10/month for more) | Unlimited |\n| YouTube TV | $73 | ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, ESPN, TBS, TNT, FS1, FS2, league channels | Limited | 3 | Unlimited |\n| Sling | Starts at $40 | ESPN, TBS, FS1, some major networks | No | 1 for Orange, 3 for Blue, 4 for Orange & Blue | 50 hours (pay $5/month for 200) |\nSports on Fubo\nFubo has sports in its DNA, and it offers channels such as ESPN, FS1, FS2, BeIN Sports, the Big 10 and the Golf Channel, along with most of your local networks like ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox. Its lineup also includes Bally Sports. However, its lack of TNT and TBS could be a dealbreaker for many baseball, basketball and hockey fans.\nAdditionally, many sports fans will need access to their local regional sports networks, or RSNs, to watch their home team's games. Fubo now offers 35 RSNs in its base package for viewers around the country --beating out DirecTV Stream's count. You will need to check to see if Fubo carries your local networks and RSNs. Fans looking for league-owned channels will have to pay for an additional package. The Sports Lite add-on includes NHL, NBA, MLB, SEC and Tennis channels for $10 a month.\nIn terms of the competition, DirecTV Stream carries TBS and TNT, RSNs, and additional channels like MLB Network, NBA TV, SEC Network but to access them you'd have to pay $109 a month, which is still $29 more than Fubo Pro and Sports Lite combined, and $9 more than Elite with Sports Lite. Hulu with Live TV also has TBS and TNT, but only carries four RSNs and even their sports add-on lacks many league-owned channels. The bulked-up Hulu costs $77 a month and includes the Disney Bundle, which also gives subscribers access to ESPN Plus. The chart at the end of this article has a full comparison of how Fubo's channel lineup fares against competitors.\nWhat's it like to use?\nWhile it may be missing some important channels, the interface feels custom-built for sports fans. Fubo's home screen features a specific \"sports\" tab that unlocks a menu right out of a sports-lover's dream. Up top is a scrolling line of featured shows and matchups, along with local games. Below that is a clean, easy-to-read list of every upcoming game airing on the service that day sorted by time and sport type. You can click on a live event and immediately begin watching, with the option to record or in some cases, start playback from the beginning. You can tap on the DVR button to record the game or even record all of the games of one of the individual teams playing.\nIf looking at the whole daily schedule of games is too much, or you are in a hurry and looking for a particular sport, Fubo breaks down the menu even further. Directly under the \"Fubo Spotlight\" section is a list across the top of the screen of just about every sport you could want. Just click on the sport you're looking for and a list of all the events in that sport will pop up. From there, you can even narrow it down further by league. For example, clicking on \"hockey\" will bring up all the hockey games airing today and for the rest of the week. But I can also toggle between the various league tabs to sort between the NHL, NCAA and AHL games -- all with DVR options readily available. Fubo offers a comprehensive way to quickly find, record or watch a sporting event. There isn't another service that even comes close to Fubo's ease of use when it comes to sports, not even YouTube TV.\nThe user interface offers a number of selections on the side of the screen including Search, Home, Sports, Shows, Movies, Guide and My Stuff. Most of these menus summon a Netflix-like grid, which groups similar types of content, but I found the navigation speed varied according to platform. I used the interface on the most popular devices including the Roku, Fire TV Stick, Apple TV, iOS and the Chrome browser. I found that while the mobile and browser versions worked as expected, the TV iterations varied, and some were slicker than others.\nIf you're using the Apple TV or Roku, for example, the navigation menu is hidden and requires side click or swipe. Of all the platforms, I liked Roku best for browsing -- it was responsive and let me use the fast-forward key to zip through the thumbnails on discovery pages.\nMy least favorite Fubo platform was the standard Amazon Fire TV Stick, and this is likely due to the hardware itself. Scrolling, whether it was up, down, left or right, was laggy with a noticeable stutter, and each thumbnail would take a couple of seconds to appear, though the newer Fire TV 4K was faster.\nMore streaming advice\n- 10 Ways to Save Money on Streaming\n- How to Cut the Cable TV Cord in 2023\n- See More at Streaming TV Insider\nShould you get it?\nWith the loss of a number of important channels over the last two years, Fubo has lost much of the diversity it once offered, and now defaults to a sports-rich offering. If you are a hardcore sports fan, or its particular selection of channels interests you, it's worthwhile at least signing up for a week to Fubo try it out. If you want the best value at this level, though, it's YouTube TV or Hulu Plus Live TV where your money is best spent.\nTop 100 channels compared\n| Channel | Philo ($25) | Sling Orange ($40) | Sling Blue ($40) | YouTube TV ($73) | Hulu with Live TV ($77) | DirecTV Stream ($80) | Fubo ($80) |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Total channels: | 42 | 24 | 35 | 78 | 75 | 57 | 56 |\n| ABC | No | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| CBS | No | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Fox | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| NBC | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| PBS | No | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |\n| CW | No | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes (limited) | Yes |\n| MyNetworkTV | No | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |\n| Channel | Philo ($25) | Sling Orange ($40) | Sling Blue ($40) | YouTube TV ($73) | Hulu with Live TV ($77) | DirecTV Stream ($80) | Fubo ($80) |\n| A&E | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | $ | No |\n| ACC Network | No | $ | No | Yes | Yes | $ | Yes |\n| Accuweather | Yes | No | No | No | No | Yes | Yes |\n| AMC | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | No |\n| Animal Planet | Yes | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| BBC America | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | No |\n| BBC World News | Yes | $ | $ | Yes | No | $ | No |\n| BET | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Big Ten Network | No | No | $ | Yes | Yes | $ | Yes |\n| Bloomberg TV | No | Yes | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Boomerang | No | $ | $ | No | $ | Yes | No |\n| Bravo | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Channel | Philo ($25) | Sling Orange ($40) | Sling Blue ($40) | YouTube TV ($73) | Hulu with Live TV ($77) | DirecTV Stream ($80) | Fubo ($80) |\n| Cartoon Network | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |\n| CBS Sports Network | No | No | No | Yes | Yes | $ | Yes |\n| Cheddar | Yes | No | No | Yes | Yes | $ | Yes |\n| Cinemax | No | No | No | $ | $ | $ | No |\n| CMT | Yes | $ | $ | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| CNBC | No | No | $ | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| CNN | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |\n| Comedy Central | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Cooking Channel | Yes | $ | $ | No | $ | $ | $ |\n| Destination America | Yes | $ | $ | No | $ | $ | $ |\n| Discovery Channel | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Disney Channel | No | Yes | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Disney Junior | No | $ | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Disney XD | No | $ | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| E!

      "text": "If you've been considering ways to replace cable, live TV streaming services offer a convenient method of watching cable channels without a contract. These cable replacements are streamed over the internet, but unlike on-demand services such as Netflix, they let you channel surf among the most popular live channels. For a flat monthly fee, these services offer can watch sports, news broadcasts, primetime TV shows, and we have compared all of the apps on mobile devices, streaming sticks and smart TV. Plus, as many of these services offer unlimited recordings, you can record all of your shows and watch them later.\nOur Picks\nWhile the live TV streaming available today is more sophisticated than ever, some services cost the same as the cable they are designed to replace. Indeed, pricing and channel availability are in a constant state of flux. After recent increases YouTube TV is now $83, DirecTV bumped its price up to $87, Fubo's basic package now costs $85 and Hulu Plus Live TV is now $83. Meanwhile, Fubo and Hulu have announced they would merge -- pending regulatory approval. But change is all part of the brave new world of live TV streaming over the internet. Here's what you need to know.\nWant to save even more money? See the Best Free TV Streaming Services: Plex, Pluto TV and more.\nWhat's the best live TV streaming service overall?\nWe've tested all of the popular paid live TV streaming services including Sling TV, Hulu Plus Live TV, DirecTV, Philo and Fubo. Among this competition, our top choices in this category are Hulu Plus Live TV and the budget-friendly Sling TV. At the affordable end of the spectrum, Sling's Blue package carries many basic channels for $46 a month, while Hulu's live offerings include a Disney streaming bundle for $83. Each service provides a user-friendly layout and a blend of live channels with unlimited DVRs and on-demand content. Beyond those two, all of the cancel-anytime live TV bundles we've evaluated on this list allow you to watch local and national news and live sports and events. You can stream live channels such as CNN, NBC, ESPN and Fox on a host of different devices. You can compare the services' channel lineups here.\nBest live TV streaming services of 2025\nBest for on-demand\nHulu Plus Live TV\nPros\n- Unlimited DVR\n- Inclusion of Disney Plus and Hulu on-demand content\n- Solid channel roster\nCons\n- Price hike\n- YouTube TV's channels are better\nFor people who ant the best mix of live streaming and on-demand, Hulu Plus Live TV is the best service to subscribe to. Its channel selection may not be as robust as YouTube TV, but it's almost there -- especially with the addition of PBS and Magnolia. Yet, it's Hulu's significant catalog of on-demand content that helps set it apart. Hulu's exclusive titles include Shogun and Only Murders in the Building, plus it has a massive catalog of broadcast programming, which grant it a content advantage no other service can match. The $83 service includes an unlimited DVR plus the ad-supported version of the Disney Bundle (Hulu Basic, Disney Plus and ESPN Plus), and if you want the ad-free bundle, the price is $96.\nIn terms of usability, the interface is friendly with plenty of options for content discovery, and all of the sections are clearly marked. Like most of its competition it has an unlimited DVR so there's plenty of space for any program you feel like bingeing on. The only annoyance is that if you want to record a show while you're watching it live, you need to exit to the guide to press the record button.\nIn January, Hulu announced it was merging with Fubo in a deal which would end the litigation between the two companies over the Venu Sports streaming service. The merger is subject to regulatory approval and no official date has yet been set.\nGiven that Hulu Plus Live TV offers you more with its live channels, namely a whole bunch of on-demand content, it's currently the service to choose for live TV streaming.\nTop channels not available on Hulu Plus Live TV: AMC, BBC America and NBA TV.\nBest cable alternative\nYouTube TV\nPros\n- More channels than competitors\n- Excellent on-screen interface and handy search bar\n- Great cloud DVR\nCons\n- $20 upgrade doesn't include much 4K content\n- On the pricier side\nYouTube TV has more top channels than any competitor at this price, and it was the first service to include local PBS stations -- Hulu and DirecTV Stream followed suit later. Despite a $10 price hike in January 2025, YouTube TV service has an excellent cloud DVR, including both unlimited storage and a generous nine months to watch recordings (most rivals offer 30 days).\nThe user interface is no-nonsense, though it has had a little spruce-up of late, and is now easier to use than ever. The service it offers most of the features a cable service can give you include time shifting and it is also the only one to offer surround sound on live broadcasts.\nYouTube TV is the exclusive home of NFL Sunday Ticket through the 2029-2030 season, with monthly payment plans available. In addition, the video streaming service has a $20 monthly upgrade that lets you watch a limited number of 4K livestreams, download DVR recordings to your devices and watch an unlimited number of simultaneous streams (up from three).\nWhile Hulu throws in Disney for the same money, and Sling TV is even cheaper, YouTube TV is still worth subscribing to if you want a tightly integrated search and a great channel selection.\nTop channels not available on YouTube TV: A&E, History, Lifetime and MLB\nPros\n- Excellent value with decent channel selection\n- Numerous choices and add-ons\n- Optional AirTV 2 tuner for local channels\nCons\n- No local channels beyond ABC, NBC and Fox in a few cities\n- Limited DVR\n- AirTV channels don't work on browsers or Apple TV\nIf you're looking for the cheapest live TV streaming service, and one that is still able to offer a usable amount of channels, then it's without a doubt Sling TV Blue. Yet, things are a little more complicated than they are for Sling's competitors. You see, Sling tenders two different $45-ish-per-month live TV streaming channel packages, Sling Orange and Sling Blue. While a number of live TV channels are common to both, Orange is essentially the ESPN/Disney package, while Blue is the Fox/Discovery package. Meanwhile, Orange & Blue combines the two offerings for $61.\nIn 2023, Sling added ABC to eight markets and you now pay $46 a month regardless of whether you receive one local channel or three. As a result, Sling TV costs up to $20 more than Philo, yet it still has better channels, more options and a comparatively better live TV streaming interface. Sling is also cheaper than most other streaming services, let alone cable, but it is a little hampered by its 50 hour DVR cap while most competitors have unlimited recordings. You can add Unlimited DVR to Sling for an extra $5 a month.\nWhile Sling doesn't have a free trial, though it is currently offering half price for the first month, but it does offer a cut-down version called Freestream with a number of included channels.\nTop channels not available on Sling Blue: CBS, Animal Planet, Disney Channel, ESPN and Nickelodeon. ABC, Fox and NBC are available in select markets.\nTop channels not available on Sling Orange: ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, Animal Planet, Bravo, CNBC, Discovery Channel, Bravo, Fox News, Fox Sports 1, FX, MSNBC and USA Network.\nPros\n- Good for channel surfers\n- Offers most regional sports networks on higher tier\nCons\n- Expensive\n- Not as many non-sports channels as competitors\nDIrecTV, formerly known as DirecTV Stream, is the most expensive service at $87, but it does have some pluses, including the flipper-friendly ability to swipe left and right to change channels. The service also offers unlimited DVR capability to new users, while existing subscribers need to pay an extra $10 a month.\nDirecTV recently announced its Genre Packs, starting at $35, which slim down channel offerings into compact packages. These are MySports for $70 a month, MyEntertainment (which includes more than 40 channels, such as Food and FX), MyNews and MiEspa\u00f1ol. Subscribers can add Mini Packs to these, which include sports and movies.\nFor cord-cutters who want to follow their local NBA or MLB team, DirecTV's $130 Choice package is a competitive live TV sports pick, because it has access to more regional sports networks than the competition. Additionally, DirecTV includes channels some other services can't, including almost 250 local PBS stations.\nTop channels not available in base package: MLB Network, NFL Network and Travel Channel.\nWatch live and on-demand TV from 100-plus top channels, including sports and news. Stream full seasons of exclusive series, hit movies, current episodes, Hulu Originals and more on Hulu, along with endless entertainment on Disney Plus and live sports on ESPN Plus.\nHow we test live TV streaming services\nWe have ordered these services based on the score each streaming service received in their individual review, and based on a number of criteria including the number of platforms, ease of use, features, cost and channels. We test each service's apps on multiple platforms including Android, iOS, Apple TV, Google TV and internet browsers, and note whenever features aren't available on some of them.\nDesign: We take into account the design of the service including its ease of use, and the layout of the program guide -- for example, how easy it it to find the content you want, or to record a show?\nContent: A live TV streaming service is only as good as the channels it offers, and we take into account the number of popular channels it supports. We also note any sports offerings, add-on packages, plus the quality of originals and back catalog content.\nValue: In terms of price, there are three tiers of live TV streaming services: free, budget and premium. While we cover free services here, the budget tier includes services like Philo and Sling TV, while the premium services like YouTube TV cost from $80 and up. We try to balance the other factors such as content and features, and how much they correlate to your \"bang for buck.\"\nFeatures: We pay special attention to features like 4K HDR, DVR and number of multiple streams, as well as unique features such as DirecTV's \"channel flipping\" mechanic which helps the service feel more cable like.\nLive TV streaming services we also tested\n- Philo: This $28 live TV streaming service offers a variety of channels, but it lacks sports channels, local stations and big-name news networks -- although Cheddar and BBC news are available. Philo offers bread-and-butter cable staples like AMC, Comedy Channel, Nickelodeon and Magnolia Network (formerly DIY), and specializes in lifestyle and reality programming. It now includes an unlimited cloud DVR and optional add-ons from Epix and Starz. We think most people are better off paying extra for Sling TV's superior service, but if Philo has every channel you want, it's a decent deal. Read our Philo review.\n- Fubo: There's a lot to like about Fubo -- it offers a wide selection of channels, and its sports focus makes it especially attractive to football fans of all kinds. For NFL in particular, it's one of three services, alongside YouTube TV and Hulu, with NFL Network and optional RedZone. In addition, it's also suited to NBA, NHL and MLB fans who live in an area served by one of Fubo's RSNs. The biggest hole in Fubo's lineup is the lack of Turner networks, including CNN, TNT and TBS -- especially since the latter two carry a lot of sports content. Those missing channels and the 2024 price bump that increased plans by $5 (plus additional RSN fees) make it less attractive than YouTube TV or Hulu for most viewers. Read our Fubo review here, and catch up on Fubo's merger with Hulu here.\nWhile you are most likely familiar with the services on this list, it's not fully reflective of every live TV platform available. If you're looking for free TV there are a number of services, while OTA (over the air) is also available if you hang an antenna.\nBest live TV streaming services\nFactors to consider for cord-cutting live TV services\nIf you want a cable-like experience at home and for on-the-go devices, without the dead weight that a cable subscription brings, a streaming service is worth a look. There's no contract to sign, and if you don't like the service you're on, you can easily switch. Whether you're looking for a basic package such as Sling TV or want to pay more for a deluxe experience from the likes of Hulu Plus Live TV, there should be a live TV streaming service to suit you. Here's some questions to help you get started:\n- Does the service offer your \"must-have\" channels? See CNET's comparison of the top 100 channels here.\n- Does it offer local channels in your area?\n- How good is the cloud DVR?\n- Does the interface make it easy to browse for shows?\n- Are there enough simultaneous streams for you and your family?\n- Is your internet connection up to snuff? See CNET's guide to improving streaming quality here.\nChannels: Each of the TV streaming services above offers a different mix of channels, so your first step should be choosing one that carries your \"can't miss\" cable channels and shows. Some of the most important live channels are local, namely ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC. Not every service offers all of them in every area, but the best streaming service for you will include the majority of what you love to watch, so it's worth shopping around.\nThe live TV streaming service lineups are in constant flux as networks scramble to secure access to popular channels (ones with highly watched original shows and regional sports networks are especially in demand). There's also the chance that a certain cable channel could disappear from a certain service after a network contract expires, which is what happened in 2020 with the regional sports networks.\nThese negotiations lead to other changes, too. Over the past few years, YouTube TV, Sling TV, Hulu (multiple times), Philo and DirecTV have all raised their prices. Google and Roku resolved a contract dispute that prevented their users from downloading the YouTube TV app, but they lost Disney channels for two days due to a different dispute. Adding to this volatility is the fact that sometimes less popular services are simply phased out -- AT&T TV Watch TV, TVision and PlayStation Vue are just three examples.\nPrice: Broadly, each of these streaming services can be broken down into two main groups: budget, with prices ranging between $25 and $50 and few or no local channels; and premium, with prices from $80 and up, and local channels and supercharged cloud DVRs. That's right, all of the services allow you to record and playback shows, just like a traditional cable or satellite DVR, but they often come with restrictions.\nNumber of simultaneous users: If you want to watch more than one program at the same time -- for example, on your living room TV and on a bedroom TV, or the main TV and a tablet or other devices -- you'll want to make sure the video streaming service you're watching has enough simultaneous streams. Sling Orange only allows one stream at a time, and if you try to watch a second, it's blocked. Other services have higher simultaneous stream limits.\nKeep in mind that, especially if you do have more than one person watching at once on supported devices, you need to make sure you have fast, reliable broadband internet. A 100Mbps download service will cost around $50 to $60 a month, and sadly that's where the savings of cutting cable can get swallowed up.\nReasons not to choose streaming TV services\nStreaming TV services are great, but there are some things they can't do compared with a traditional cable box. First, it's worth looking at the channels that you can't get with any of these live TV streaming services. For example, only there of the services are currently able to offer PBS: YouTube TV and DirecTV and Hulu Plus Live TV\nWith sports, fans want to make sure they can find the sports channels to follow their teams. Most services carry ESPN and local channels for NFL football, but if you follow a professional baseball or basketball team, you might need its specific channel -- called a regional sports network or RSN -- to watch regular season games. RSN coverage varies widely for each service. Sometimes, even if you live in the right area, you may be mistakenly blacked out due to an IP address error. If this is the case, you can fix this by signing up for a sports-friendly VPN.\nEvery live TV service's video streaming is a few seconds to a minute or more behind the \"live\" stream you'll get from your local cable TV or satellite provider. That means you could get a preview of scores or big plays from Twitter, phone alerts or calls from friends slightly before you see the action on screen.\nIf you're used to 5.1-channel surround offered by cable or even OTA, then you may be disappointed that YouTube is the only service to offer surround sound on live broadcasts. The other services include stereo sound only on live channels, though 5.1 audio is available on some on-demand material."

      "text": "Pros\n- More popular channels than any competitor\n- Superb cloud DVR\n- Excellent on-screen interface and handy search bar\nCons\n- $10 upgrade doesn't include much 4K content\nYouTube TV has solidified its reputation as one of the best live TV streaming services available. The Google-owned platform features an extensive array of channels and is known for its easy-to-navigate user experience. These are important details to highlight, considering the fact that the streamer has steadily increased its price over the years. It now costs $83 a month, which is more than twice its original cost. It may feel like the overall value of the service isn't as clear-cut as it once was, but its price mirrors that of its closest rival, Hulu Plus Live TV.\nYouTube TV's main strength for cord-cutters is its sheer number of channels. It now offers 78 of the top 100 networks, the most of any streaming service, a count that includes numerous cable staples plus all four local networks -- ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC -- and local PBS stations nationwide.\nBeyond channels, YouTube TV is easy to use: It's slick and speedy on a variety of TVs and mobile devices. Its cloud DVR is also one of the best, with unlimited storage and pretty much all the capabilities of a hardware DVR. The service also offers a 4K streaming upgrade -- for an additional $10 monthly -- which, importantly, includes unlimited simultaneous streams and downloadable DVR recordings.\nThe big snag is the price, and if you're a cord-cutter, the trimmed-down Sling TV Blue at $46 a month is the best way to save money. At the other end of the spectrum, the $83 Hulu Plus Live TV offers a similar mix of channels, but the addition of the modified Disney Bundle that gives you access to on-demand Hulu, ESPN Plus and Disney Plus, brings some extra value. If you're wanting to stick with a familiar cable tv experience, the myriad of channels and unlimited DVR feature offered by YouTube TV makes the $83 price associated with its base package well worth the money. It's still a good deal for what you're getting.\nRead more: Best Streaming Devices\nWhat do you get?\nYouTube TV is different from YouTube, the free video service with more than 2.5 billion users a month. YouTube TV offers an experience similar to cable TV, with live channels and on-demand content available on a variety of devices. It works with Apple TV, Roku, Android TV, Chromecast and Amazon Fire TV, along with numerous smart TVs, phones, tablets, game consoles and web browsers.\nPremium services compared\n| YouTube TV | Hulu with Live TV | Fubo | Sling | Sling Orange & Blue | DirecTV | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Monthly Price | $83 | $83 | $85 | $46 | $66 | $87 |\n| Total Channels | 100+ | 95+ | 150+ | 34+ | 46+ | 90+ |\n| RSNs? | Limited | Limited | Yes | No | No | Yes |\n| Number of simultaneous streams | 3 | 2 (Pay an extra $10/month unlimited) | 10 at home (3 outside home) | 1 for Sling Orange, 3 for Sling Blue | 4 | Unlimited at home (3 outside home) |\n| Cloud DVR | Unlimited | Unlimited | Unlimited | 50 hours (pay $5/month for unlimited) | 50 hours (pay $5/month for unlimited) | Unlimited |\nYouTube TV's channel selection is excellent, with more from CNET's list of 100 top channels than any other competitor (although Hulu isn't too far behind). More channels don't necessarily mean more of what you want. Some services, such as Fubo, lean heavily on sports, while others are increasingly expansive. It's best to check the list at the end of this article, which compares individual channels across services, to ensure you're getting the channels you want. While competitors include several channel upgrade packages, YouTube TV includes everything for one price, with one exception explained below.\nThe service also includes 5.1 surround sound, where available, for all subscribers (most competitors are only in stereo) and an expansion of the DVR search, which can now pick out specific sports, which is most useful for events such as the Olympics.\nWhat's it like to use?\nCompared to some services with multilevel interfaces, YouTube TV is fairly simple. There are three main tabs at the top of the interface: Library, Home and Live (on mobile, these tabs are located at the bottom). Library is where your DVR content lives, and Home is where featured and live thumbnails appear. The Live tab is a familiar-looking program grid that displays both currently playing and upcoming shows. You can search for content from the top of any page, making it relatively easy to jump straight to the programming you want. Additionally, viewers can customize the live guide with their favorite channels, or set it to be sorted alphabetically or by the most-watched channels.\nThere's also a button at the top that offers the ability to buy add-on packages and rent or buy movies within the app. A search icon allows you to type in networks or what you want to watch, and we should note that YouTube TV uses your search history for its recommendation engine. If you want, you can delete your searches.\nYou can also perform searches with a compatible voice remote or Google Assistant. This is easier if you have an Android TV streamer, you could also perform searches on your Google Nest Mini and play it on a Roku, for example.\nThe DVR works as you'd expect -- both time-shifting live content and playing back recorded shows -- and the system assigns your recorded content to manageable categories, such as recently recorded and most viewed. The DVR also includes the ability to rewind and fast-forward freely through recordings, even ones that aren't yet completed. The Roku interface offers a 15-second skip by default, while the Apple TV's control system via the Siri Remote is even better. You can use the touchpad to scroll through videos and it's glorious. It's so much fun, and auto-generated thumbnails make it relatively easy to get to the part you want.\nIn the past, when a show appeared in a network's on-demand library, it would automatically replace the version in your cloud DVR, meaning you'd lose the ability to fast-forward through commercials though Google says this should no longer occur. Additionally, YouTube TV's DVR isn't truly unlimited; the shows will expire after nine months (just like Hulu), but this is still much longer than the 30 days you get with most rivals.\nYouTube TV rolled out a multiview feature in 2023, enabling subscribers to watch up to four separate sports streams on one screen. The functionality has since been expanded to include news and weather channels with the option to watch either two or four streams at a time. It works on smart TVs as well as phones, and all you have to do is scroll to the \"Watch in Multiview\" section on the home screen.\nOn a mobile phone, the YouTube TV app operates as smoothly as the TV version. I was able to filter by channel and genre to comb through content, and the multiview feature is available on my phone as well. If your phone is connected to a smart TV or media player, you can cast YouTube TV to those devices, which can come in handy if you're watching while away from home. It's also easy to download TV show episodes and movies on the mobile app and stream them right on your phone.\nAlthough Google used to integrate YouTube into YouTube TV -- with trailers and related content on a show's About page -- this appears to no longer be the case. The company is continually tweaking the interface, and we may see YouTube content appear again at some point.\nIs it worth the $10 for 4K?\nIt depends. The $10 4K Plus upgrade could be useful if you're looking to stream 4K sporting events and on-demand programming, but the amount of content available in 4K is still limited. There is one new feature that may prove the most useful, especially for travelers, and that's the ability to view an unlimited number of simultaneous streams, and the option to save DVR recordings for offline mobile viewing. If you're a frequent flyer or subway rider, the ability to watch prerecorded shows without an active connection is an attractive feature.\nAs per YouTube TV's 4K page, the additional content includes shows from Discovery, ESPN, Fox Sports, FX, NBA TV, Nat Geo, NBC Sports and Tastemade. If you want to watch certain premium content (e.g. South Park), you may need to subscribe separately to premium add-ons for Max, Peacock and other services.\nThe interface includes a 4K button to help find content, but at present, this doesn't constitute enough to stick around for. In addition to a handful of shows, there's Thursday Night Football, \"live\" Premier League soccer and college football on ESPN. The NCAA adds a bunch of 4K content, but if you want football, 4K or a combination of the two, Fubo offers even more sports for a $90 price tag.\nThe 4K content that is available with the basic subscription, such as the cooking show Make This Tonight or the travel competition show Basic Versus Baller, does look good, with better contrast and color than regular broadcast TV. In context, the top tier of Netflix costs substantially more at $25 per month, but it offers thousands of hours of 4K content alone, plus offline viewing.\nThink of YouTube TV as a cable replacement\nWhen it originally appeared for $35, YouTube TV was an exceedingly attractive way to save money over cable. But as the service has piled on more channels, it's added further costs. When you take that $83 monthly fee and apply it to the $55 you're probably already paying for internet service, it means you're paying over $130 a month. Many cable TV providers will give you a TV and internet bundle for around the same money.\nPrices vary a lot, of course, and with cable, you probably have to pay rental equipment fees, taxes and other extras. Cable providers usually reserve the best bundle pricing for people who sign a contract. The same goes for \"streaming\" offerings, such as Comcast's StreamSaver, which can be paired with its NOW TV offering. The reason you want to cut cable in the first place remains.\nRead more here: Streaming vs. Cable: Which One Saves You More Money?\nLike Hulu with Live TV, Sling TV and others, YouTube TV is contract-free, so you can cancel anytime. Streaming services also have other advantages over cable. They're easier to watch on phones and tablets, for example. At $83 per month, you'll have to be coming from a relatively expensive cable bill to realize substantial savings with YouTube TV.\nShould you get YouTube TV?\nIf price is no object, YouTube TV goes neck and neck with Hulu Plus Live TV as the premier live TV streaming service, with a huge array of entertainment options and one of the best DVR/search combos on the market. It offers more channels than anyone else and its 5.1 surround is great for sports and movie fans. If you don't want to be beholden to a traditional cable company, it's a great alternative.\nThough $83 a month is a tough expenditure for some people, without a contract to worry about, you're free to jump ship to a better deal at any time. The extra $10 is still too much for so little 4K content, even if unlimited streams and DVR downloads are useful for extended families or travelers. If you want more on-demand content for your buck, then Hulu Plus Live TV's Disney bundle is fairly unbeatable.\nLastly, if you're a hard-core cord-cutter and determined to save money, Sling TV Blue offers a compelling alternative, especially when paired with an antenna or an AirTV 2.\nBelow, you'll find a comparison of the top 100 channels offered by a few of YouTube TV's competitors.
