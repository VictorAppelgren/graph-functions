  "content": "Aug. 11\u2014Freeborn, Mower counties celebrate 40th anniversary since creation of Relay for Life\n\nThe Freeborn-Mower County Relay for Life celebrated a special milestone on Friday at the Freeborn County Fairgrounds.\n\nThis was the 40th anniversary of the first relay in the nation in 1985. Freeborn and Mower counties have taken part in the event for about 30 years, according to event organizer Angie Hanson.\n\nThe original Relay for Life took place in Tacoma, Washington, when Dr. Gordy Klatt walked around a track for 24 hours, raising $27,000 for the American Cancer Society, according to the American Cancer Society website.\n\nThe Freeborn-Mower County Relay for Life kicked off with music, activities for children and families, a silent auction and food served by Freeborn County 4-H members.\n\nSeveral organizers and participants attended the event wearing light blue shirts with \"Team Terry\" printed on them. This was to honor Terry Vandersnick, who recently passed away from cancer.\n\nWhen it came time for the opening ceremony, the Freeborn County Honor Guard presented the colors and Diane Heaney sang the national anthem.\n\nThe Rev. Robert Bailey gave the invocation for the event.\n\nRelay for Life is especially meaningful for him, he said, because he has had prostate cancer for 33 years, but due to God's grace and support from his doctors and loved ones, he has been active the whole time.\n\n\"At 85, my wife keeps telling me God's not done with me,\" Bailey said.\n\nThis year Todd Utpadel gave a speech as the honorary chairperson of the event.\n\n\"I got the call and Diane [Hanson] asked me to be the chairperson, and without thinking I said 'yes,'\" Utpadel said. \"Then I thought about the responsibility of being the chair. First, you've got to speak on behalf of the survivors. You have to speak up on behalf of the caregivers.\"\n\nHe added that he also has the responsibility to speak on behalf of those lost to cancer.\n\nThe year 2024, Utpadel said, started like any other year. An active musician, he was playing at the Albert Lea Moose Lodge No. 1703 when he began thinking about all of the family members and friends who had passed away from cancer.\n\nHe especially thought of the expenses of treatment that insurance does not cover, which presents a great challenge to many cancer patients and their families.\n\nHe decided then that he was going to give all of the money he made from performing and donate it to people going through cancer, and his fundraising campaign, \"Musicians Against Cancer,\" began.\n\nThe first night, Utpadel said, he got $125 worth of tips and set the goal to raise $5,000 during the year.\n\nThat April, Utpadel underwent a colonoscopy as part of his regular physical. After the procedure, his doctor told him that he had colon cancer and they had found a tumor almost the size of a baseball.\n\n\"I was never scared when I heard those words,\" Utpadel said. \"I was mainly worried about my family and the people around me than what I was going to have to go through.\"\n\nWhile meeting with his cancer team, he said, the doctors asked him what he was most worried about. Utpadel said he was most worried about missing the 24 shows he had booked to raise money for people going through cancer.\n\nHis doctors warned him that he would miss at least some of the events, he said, but he did not accept that as an answer.\n\n\"People ask, 'How did you make it through it?' I tell them, 'Find what you're passionate about and chase it. Then you'll make it through it,\" Utpadel said.\n\nHis outlook was so positive that staff at the clinic where he was receiving treatment asked him to talk with some of the other patients.\n\nHe advised people going through cancer treatment to not let the disease become a barrier to living their life.\n\n\"You've got to get up ... You've got to find your 'why,'\" he said.\n\nFor Utpadel, this looked like increasing the number of performances he booked for the year. In 2024, he said, he finished the year with 35 bookings and never missed a show.\n\nSometimes, he added, he went to perform right after receiving chemotherapy or with a chemotherapy bulb on his hip.\n\n\"What I've learned most is that you've got to believe that there's always going to be a tomorrow,\" he said. \"I've got my family. I've got my faith. I've got my music, and I'm going to help a lot of people.\"\n\nMusicians Against Cancer raised over $50,000 by the end of the year. This was from money and tips Utpadel had earned in addition to sponsors of the event, such as the Moose Lodge.\n\nUtpadel himself did not take any of the money he raised throughout the year, but he said he thinks part of the event's success was because people knew he had cancer, prompting them to want to donate.\n\nTalking with the doctors, he said, he realized that events like Relay for Life make it possible for all of the medical advances he learned about.\n\n\"For those we have lost, they will never be forgotten,\" he said, encouraging people to look around at the hundreds of luminary bags decorating the fairgrounds.\n\n\"For our caretakers, my wife, my family, there aren't enough thank yous in this world,\" Utpadel said as he closed his speech.\n\nEvery year, the walk begins with a survivor's lap for cancer survivors and their caregivers. Before the survivor's lap began this year, those in attendance were asked to take a moment of silence to remember Vandersnick and all loved ones lost to cancer.",
