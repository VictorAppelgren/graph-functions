  "title": "Texas Republicans passed their redistricting map. Now they're taking aim at the tactic Democrats used to delay it.",
  "description": "Democrats successfully stalled the plan for weeks by fleeing the state. New proposed rules would strictly limit their ability to do that in the future.",
  "content": "Shortly after the Texas House of Representatives finally approved its redistricting plan following weeks of delays, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott proposed legislation that would strictly limit the kinds of walkouts that Democrats used to hold up the bill in the future.\n\nThe Texas Legislature is currently holding a special session to consider a long list of bills in addition to the redistricting plan, which needs to be approved one more time by the state Senate before it can be signed into law. Abbott has added the new restrictions on walkouts to their agenda for the rest of the session.\n\n\u201cWe need to ensure that rogue lawmakers cannot hijack the important business of Texans during a legislative session by fleeing the state,\u201d he wrote in a statement announcing the proposal.\n\nThe redistricting plan, which would redraw the lines of Texas\u2019s congressional districts to potentially secure the GOP five more seats in Congress in next year\u2019s midterms, appeared to be on an easy path toward passage early this month until dozens of Democrats fled the state to block the Republican-dominated Legislature from being able to meet.\n\nThe walkout successfully prevented Republicans from holding a vote on the plan for roughly two weeks. Each of the Democrats was fined $500 a day during their absence. Abbott also threatened to have them removed from office and civil warrants were issued for their arrest. The Democrats eventually chose to return to Texas in order to lay the groundwork for a legal challenge they plan to mount against the new maps. Their presence allowed the House to meet and approve the proposal.\n\nWhat would the new rules do?\n\nThe bill would create new penalties for \u201cexcessive absence\u201d by lawmakers. If it becomes law, any member of the Texas House or Senate who misses seven consecutive days of legislative proceedings, without being granted a leave of absence, would lose their seat in the Legislature.\n\nWalkouts would still be possible under the proposed rules, but they could only last for so long before any absent lawmakers would be booted from their seats. Under current rules, walkouts can last as long as absent members are able to remain out of the state.\n\nThe new restrictions would go into effect immediately if they\u2019re passed by a two-thirds majority in both houses of the state Legislature. In the more likely event that they pass with a simple majority, they will go into effect 90 days after the special session ends.\n\nWhere does the redistricting battle go from here?\n\nOnce Texas\u2019s new map is signed into law, the fight will shift to the courts. Democrats argue that the GOP\u2019s district lines violate laws against racial gerrymandering. Republicans counter that the map was drawn purely for political reasons, which is legal under current Supreme Court precedent.\n\nAnother thing the Democrats accomplished with their walkout was turning redistricting into a national issue. California has started the process of redrawing its own maps specifically to counter any gains the GOP makes through redistricting in Texas. Democrats in a few other blue states, most notably New York and Illinois, have considered whether they too should enact new district lines.\n\nRepublicans also have their eyes on potential seats elsewhere in the country. GOP leaders in Ohio, Missouri, Indiana and Florida have all said they could consider trying to get new maps in place ahead of next year\u2019s midterms.",

      "text": "California redistricting vote begins with overwhelming support, Newsom pollster says\nWASHINGTON \u2015 California Gov. Gavin Newsom's redistricting proposal aimed at creating five new Democratic congressional seats begins with overwhelming support ahead of a planned November referendum when voters would decide its fate, according to a survey conducted by his longtime pollster.\nThe proposal is backed by 57% of California voters and opposed by 35%, the poll taken by Democratic pollster David Binder found, according to a report by Axios. Another 8% of voters in the heavily Democratic state said they were undecided.\nNewsom has portrayed his mid-term redistricting push as necessary to offset Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's pursuit to create five new Republican congressional districts in Texas. President Donald Trump has publicly lobbied for the gerrymandering in Texas to boost Republican chances in the 2026 midterm elections.\nMore: California Gov. Gavin Newsom announces special election to re-draw maps\n85532959007\nNewsom last week called for a Nov. 4 special election on the new maps. The California state legislature, where Democrats have a supermajority, would first need to vote to put the measure before the voters.\nThe poll found 84% of California's Democratic voters support the redistricting plan while 79% of the state's Republicans oppose it. The 57% in overall support for the redistricting plan is a jump from the 51% who said they backed redrawing California's congressional maps in a July poll.\nMore: California Republicans sue to hold up Democratic redistricting plan\nCalifornia currently has 43 congressional seats held by Democrats and nine by Republicans. The creation of five new Democratic-friendly districts could sway California's delegation to a 48-5 advantage for Democrats. Yet the move comes with risk for Democrats because it might create several competitive seats that Republicans could target.\n\"I know they say, 'Don't mess with Texas,'\" Newsom, widely considered a potential presidential candidate in 2028, quipped at a Democratic rally kicking off the redistricting campaign last week. \"Well, don't mess with the great Golden State.\"\nCalifornia has an independent redistricting commission that is designed to limit partisan influence on the map-drawing process, but Newsom said the measure would allow a new process to draw maps that would go into effect for House elections in 2026, 2028, and 2030, before ceding power back to the commission to draw maps ahead of 2032.\nRedistricting in all states is required by federal law every 10 years following the release of new U.S. Census Bureau figures; however, Trump pushed Texas Republicans to jumpstart the process in the middle of the decade, setting off a cross-country redistricting fight.\nRedistricting efforts are also ongoing in Florida and Ohio that could benefit Republicans, while Republican-controlled Indiana and Missouri are also discussing redrawing their maps.\nControl of the U.S. House of Representatives at stake, with Republicans currently holding a 219-212 majority.\nContributing: Erin Mansfield of USA TODAY\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison.\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: California redistricting vote has major support: Newsom pollster"
