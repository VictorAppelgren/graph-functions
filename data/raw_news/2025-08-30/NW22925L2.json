  "title": "Why 20% Of U.S. Billionaires Are Enjoying Higher Life Expectancy",
  "description": "America\u2019s billionaires are older than ever, with one in five already in their 80s or 90s. That doesn\u2019t mean they are necessarily slowing down.",
  "content": "America\u2019s billionaires are older than ever, with one in five already in their 80s or 90s. That doesn\u2019t mean they are necessarily slowing down.\n\narren Buffett took a seat on stage at Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s annual meeting for the sixtieth - and likely final time in May. He wore a red tie that matched the two cans of Coca-Cola in front of him, one Cherry and one regular. (Buffett has joked that his longevity is tied to his diet of McDonald's, Coke, and Dairy Queen, all companies in which Berkshire has invested.)\n\nWhile his voice was raspy and he hunched over a bit, the Oracle of Omaha was as sharp and unfazed as ever, answering a question about recent market turmoil. \u201cWhat happened in the last\u2026100 days\u2026is really nothing,\u201d he said to a crowd of some 40,000. \u201cThe day I was born, the Dow Jones was at 240. That was August 30, 1930. Between that and the low, it went from 240 to 41.\u201d He went on to say that if people worried about whether their stocks went down 15%, they needed a \u201cdifferent investment philosophy\u201d and to prepare for a \u201chair-curler\u201d stock market event, which would undoubtedly happen in the next 20 years.\n\nThen, at the very end of the four-plus hour long meeting, he dropped a bomb: Buffett announced that he\u2019d retire as Berkshire\u2019s CEO at the end of the year, nearly six decades to the day from when he took control of a small, struggling textile company called Berkshire Hathaway. \u201cI will still hang around and could conceivably be useful in a few cases,\u201d he said, surprising even his key lieutenant Greg Abel, who was named Buffett\u2019s successor in 2021 but didn\u2019t know about his imminent plans.\n\nThe fact that someone as rich and successful as Buffett \u2013 he\u2019s been on The Forbes 400 every year since the first list in 1982 and is still the 10th richest person on the planet, despite having given away more than $64 billion \u2013 chose to work for decades after the average American\u2019s retirement age might strike some as crazy. But there are plenty of other octogenarian and nonagenarian billionaires who, like Buffett, would rather work until the day they die.\n\nThe oldest American billionaire, George Joseph, is still working at $5.5 billion (revenue) Mercury General, the insurance company he founded in the early 1960s. A flight navigator during World War II, Joseph stepped down as CEO at age 85 but still owns 35% of the publicly traded company and mans the controls at age 103 as chairman of the publicly traded firm. He is the only American billionaire over the age of 99.\n\nMedia giant Rupert Murdoch, 94, stepped down as executive chairman of $8.5 billion (revenue) News Corp. almost two years ago, ceding the title to his son Lachlan, but continues to have a large presence at the company. Earlier this summer, Trump sued the elder Murdoch and the Wall Street Journal (which is owned by News Corp.) over an article the newspaper ran about a birthday card Trump allegedly wrote to Jeffrey Epstein. At the time, the president\u2019s lawyers reportedly pushed for Murdoch to be deposed within 15 days due to his age. According to the New York Times article on the postponement of that deadline, Murdoch had even agreed to update Trump on his health.\n\nMurdoch, who many believe was a key inspiration for the hit TV series Succession, still doesn\u2019t appear to have entirely figured out his own succession plans: A Nevada court last year shut down his efforts to leave control of News Corp and the parent company of Fox News solely to his eldest son, Lachlan, in an apparent effort to preserve the company\u2019s right-wing orientation. Three of his other children, Prudence, Elisabeth, and James, are set to retain equal voting rights.\n\nMurdoch isn\u2019t the only nonagenarian catching heat from Trump. The president took to Truth Social in late August to argue that billionaire George Soros, 95, and \u201chis wonderful Radical Left son\u201d should be charged with racketeering for their supposed role in \u201cViolent Protests.\u201d He warned Soros and \u201chis group of psychopaths\u201d to be careful: \u201cWe\u2019re watching you!\u201d Trump wrote. Soros, who retired from his hedge fund years ago and has already given away some $23 billion in support of some of the world\u2019s most pressing charitable causes, has long been a Democratic Party megadonor.\n\nAltogether, there are a record 36 American billionaires who are 90 and older. Another 150 are in their 80s, including former Victoria\u2019s Secret CEO Les Wexner and former New York City mayor and Bloomberg cofounder Michael Bloomberg. It\u2019s impressive given that the CDC says that the average life expectancy in the US is 78.4 for all Americans and 75.8 for the nation\u2019s men (who dominate the billionaire ranks).\n\nOverall, only 3.8% of the US population is 80 or older, according to the 2020 census results, compared to 20% of American billionaires on our list. Why does such a larger percentage of American billionaires seem to live past 80 than the U.S. population overall? There could be a lot of reasons, including the fact that wealthy people can afford the best healthcare, personal trainers, and freshest foods.\n\nOne billionaire who passed away in June at age 102 was pretty certain why he lived so well for so long. David Murdock, the long-time majority shareholder of Dole, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of fruits and vegetables, was a strong advocate of plant-based diets and ate only fruits (including banana and orange peels), vegetables, and fish, having publicly stated his aim to live to 125.\n\nMurdock also donated heavily to longevity research and helped set up the North Carolina Research Campus in Kannapolis, NC, a 350-acre research center that researches ways to improve human health through nutrition. \"We have developed a culture in which we eat with our taste buds, not our brains,\" he told Forbes at age 90.\n\nTo find out what others believe is their secret, Forbes reached out to at least 30 billionaires over 90 and another 30 over 80. Most didn\u2019t respond or declined to comment. One who did: Charles Koch, who, at age 89, is still actively serving as chairman and co-CEO of Koch, Inc., a diversified conglomerate and America's second-largest private company by revenue. According to Koch, daily exercise of his mind and body is \u201chis number one priority.\u201d He reads and writes \u201cextensively\u201d and does \u201can hour or hour and a half strength and cardio workout daily.\u201d Back in 2023, when he sat down in person with Forbes, he elaborated further, explaining that going to his full-time job, where he strives to solve complex problems, helps keep him sharp: \u201cI have retired friends at the club I belong to in Palm Springs who play nine holes every morning, have lunch, and play gin all afternoon,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I did that, I\u2019d put a bullet in my head.\u201d\n\nStock trading pioneer Joe Ricketts feels similarly, and says he still works \u201cseven days a week,\u201d at age 84. Industrialist Dennis Washington, who survived a bout of polio as a child, started operating heavy cranes straight out of high school before striking out on his own with a $30,000 loan. At age 91, he continues to be involved in the high-level management of his portfolio of companies, with interests in heavy equipment, copper mining, and marine transportation. \u201cI would hope my legacy would be for people to say that \u2018He lived the American dream,\u2019\u201d he says, describing his life as \u201ca rags to riches story.\u201d But he stops short of attributing his longevity to either his work ethic or exercise habits. When asked why he has lived such a long and healthy life, he jokingly responds: \u201cOnly God knows!\u201d\n\nJoseph founded Mercury General in the 1960s after raising $2 million in capital. The company now brings in $5.5 billion in annual revenue, offering auto, home, and fire insurance. He owns 35% of the firm and remains its chairman.\n\nSchwartz cofounded Bio-Rad Laboratories with her late husband in a UC Berkeley Quonset hut in 1952. Widowed in 2012, she stepped down from the board in 2022. Her son Norman is chairman and CEO.\n\nTisch inherited shares of diversified holding company Loews Corporation, built by her husband and his brother. The company had over $80 billion in assets at the end of 2024.\n\nKimmel is the founder of apparel company Jones New York, which later added Nine West, Barney\u2019s, and other brands to its portfolio. He stepped down as CEO in 2002 and sold the firm for nearly $2.2 billion in 2014. He then ran Sidney Kimmel Entertainment, which produced such movies as The Lincoln Lawyer (film) and The Kite Runner, until its merger with Ivanhoe Pictures in 2017.\n\nGerry is the cable TV pioneer who founded Cablevision Industries. In 1996, he sold the company to Time Warner for a reported $2.7 billion, pocketing an estimated $900 million.\n\nOne of the largest landowners in the country, he and his family hold over 2.4 million acres across the U.S. He also founded Sierra Pacific Industries, the largest private lumber production firm in the nation. Though his sons now run the firm, \u201cRed\u201d is still a regular at the office.\n\nHe inherited the publishing and broadcasting empire Advance Publications decades ago with his late brother S.I. (d. 2017). The company is still family-owned. One of its most valuable holdings is its stake in social news site Reddit.\n\nIn 1952, Lerner lent her husband Ted $250 to start a real estate business that grew into Lerner Enterprises, one of the largest property owners in the Washington, D.C. area. She and her children inherited Ted\u2019s estate after his 2023 death.\n\nBorn in Hungary in 1930, Soros survived the Nazi occupation and the persecution of Hungarian jews thanks to forged papers purchased by his father. After studying at the London School of Economics, he immigrated to the United States in the 1950s, where he made his fortune as a hedge fund manager.\n\nThe son of a U.S. congressman from Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett grew up during the Great Depression and bought his first stock at age 11. In 1970, he became the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway and led its transformation into a holding company with a golden portfolio, whose investments include stakes in American Express, Bank of America, and Chevron. He is considered one of the most successful investors of all time.",

      "text": "Weed has always paid off for the godfathers of stoner comedy. Now they\u2019ve built a company that sells THC-infused edibles, drinks and of course some tasty bud, all of which brings in some serious green.\nIf you spend enough time with Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong, America\u2019s best-known pothead entertainers, you\u2019ll hear enough stories to realize why the duo became comedy legends.\nConsider this gem: Sometime in the late 1970s, after Marin was wanted by the FBI for dodging the draft during the Vietnam war, and after Cheech and Chong became household names, the Los Angeles native dropped acid with the king of turning on and dropping out\u2014Timothy Leary.\n\u201c[Leary] had this great blotter acid,\u201d says Marin, 79, while sitting in his home office near Joshua Tree, California.\nOn Matador Beach in Malibu one night, Leary taught Marin all about the stars and constellations while the LSD took hold. Marin had visions of cave men looking up at the stars and telling stories about the figures and shapes they saw above. And that\u2019s when he had a revelation: \u201cYou could connect with a whole history of people looking up at the sky,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was a moment of we-are-all-one by this fact that we're in this universe that we can identify.\u201d\nHe also learned one of the best tips for surviving the early days of the war on drugs from Leary\u2019s fifth wife, Barbara. Marin asked her how to disguise a sheet of acid while traveling and she wrote a phone number and address on it. Now, it was just a piece of paper with a woman\u2019s information. \u201cA good smuggling trick,\u201d says Marin.\nAs for Tommy Chong, now 87, he, too, has his fair share of tales from his decades of being a Hollywood star (including how he got high with Arnold Schwarzenegger during his early years as a body builder on Venice Beach) and a convicted felon. In 2003, the Drug Enforcement Administration raided his home in California in connection with his bong company, Chong Glass, on charges of conspiracy to distribute drug paraphernalia. In September of that year, he was sentenced to nine months in prison. His cellmate? The Wolf of Wall Street, Jordan Belfort, who was serving time for fraud related to his notorious penny stock scheme immortalized by Martin Scorsese\u2019s 2013 film.\nOne day, while Chong was working on his book Belfort sat down and started writing too. He wrote one page and \u201che handed it to me, like I was a teacher,\u201d Chong says.\n\u201cI looked at the page and I recognized that he had copied [Tom Wolfe\u2019s] The Bonfire of the Vanities. I realized the guy was a thief, he would even plagiarize a book, just out of habit,\u201d Chong says, laughing. \u201cHe asked me: \u2018What do you think?\u2019 And I said, \u2018You haven\u2019t written shit.\u201d\nChong advised Belfort to write down all the stories he shared at night about \u201cthe women, the drugs, the whole thing.\u201d Belfort wrote every day after that. And when they both got out, Belfort showed up at Chong\u2019s house and told him how he sold his memoir and that Scorsese was going to direct the movie. \u201cWow, that was a trip,\u201d says Chong.\nThese days, Cheech and Chong are playing by the rules, as long as you ignore the federal laws regarding marijuana. In 2020, the duo, along with their business partners Brandon Harshbarger, Jonathan Black, and Tom Cole, launched two companies, California-based Cheech and Chong Cannabis Co., which licenses its brand, genetics, formulas and retail designs to marijuana companies, and Cheech and Chong\u2019s Global Holding Company, a Nevada-based endeavor that sells hemp-derived products ranging from gummies to flower to THC-infused drinks. (The hemp company also licenses the Cheech and Chong brand to make accessories and apparel.)\nAnd there\u2019s nothing to joke about when it comes to their business, of which they own about 8% each. In 2025, the companies\u2019 combined revenue will hit nearly $100 million from both marijuana and hemp, up from about $50 million last year. The companies, which outsource manufacturing to third parties, are worth roughly $150 million.\nThough Cheech and Chong famously split in the mid-1980s after making their first non-stoner comedy, The Corsican Brothers, the pair have reunited many times over the past four decades and it was not a heavy lift to get the brand back together. After all, weed is why the duo became famous in the first place. And as the U.S. cannabis market posted $32 billion in sales last year across 40 states, Cheech and Chong, if anybody, deserve a taste of the action.\nThe two have mellowed with age, but they are not that humble when it comes to their place in the marijuana industry. After all, they are the godfathers of the stoner comedy genre thanks to Up In Smoke, their 1978 debut film followed by Nice Dreams and other movies, all of which influenced generations of films from Dave Chappelle\u2019s Half Baked to Seth Rogen\u2019s Pineapple Express.\n\u201cIf it wasn't for Cheech and Chong, there wouldn't be weed on the planet,\u201d says Chong, who admits he might be exaggerating, just a little. \u201cWe invented weed.\u201d\nThen again, he also takes a spiritual approach to the plant: \u201cThe weed is ordained,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s from God.\u201d\nAnd lord knows they are making the most of it. Currently, there are nine Cheech and Chong branded dispensaries (operated by licensees of the brand under the name Cheech and Chong Dispensoria) across Maine, Massachusetts and New Mexico. One will open in New York later this year with four more under contract. The company also has six hemp shops, (operated by licensees under the name Cheech and Chong Apothecaria) across Texas. Those shops sell hemp-derived THC products, thanks to the federal legalization of hemp-derived cannabinoids under the Farm Bill of 2018. The company\u2019s cannabis products are sold through a total of 1,500 dispensaries across 19 states, bringing in about $34 million in sales this year between licensing agreements and royalties on retail sales.\nWhile celebrity cannabis brands do not typically do well, despite a few exceptions such as Mike Tyson\u2019s Tyson 2.0 and Wiz Khalifa\u2019s Khalifa Kush, Cheech and Chong have a unique advantage\u2014not only are they synonymous with weed, but they also have massive fan base that spans generations.\n\u201cMy mom knows them as Up In Smoke, I know them as That \u201870s Show and Tin Cup and my kids know 'em as Zootopia and Lion King,\u201d says Cheech and Chong CEO Jonathan Black. \u201cTheir brand had endless recognition. You can't talk about cannabis, or hemp now, without mentioning Cheech and Chong.\u201d\nCannabis sales for the brand have taken off, but the hemp division is even more lucrative\u2014it expects about $60 million in sales by the end of the year. A big portion of hemp sales is its line of THC-infused beverages, Cheech and Chong\u2019s High & Dry seltzer. And the duo just inked a deal with Circle K, which will carry their hemp derived THC-infused beverages in a pilot program across 2,000 stores. Total Wine and More, ABC Fine Wine and Liquors and Binny\u2019s Beverage Depot already carry the stoners\u2019 beverages.\nWhile Cheech and Chong still get high the old-fashioned way, at their age they have been enjoying beverages and gummies.\n\u201c[THC drinks] are the growing future of the industry because you don't need to be into dispensary to buy it,\u201d says Marin. Thanks to federal law, hemp-derived THC is legal even though marijuana-derived THC is not. Thanks to this distinction, big liquor retailers across the country now carry THC drinks alongside beer and spirits. \u201cThe drinks are so popular we can't keep 'em on the shelves, which tells you something.\u201d\nTHC-infused drinks seem to be well timed. A recent Gallup poll found that only 54% of American adults say they drink alcohol, down from 71% in 1977, a historic low for the country.\n\u201cBeer is suffering mightily and there's a huge opportunity for us,\u201d says Cole, who is a board member of Cheech and Chong Cannabis Co. and had been the chairman of the Wine & Spirits Wholesalers of America.\nDespite decades of stoner jokes, Cheech and Chong have always been much savvier than their comedic personas. (Marin won the Celebrity Jeopardy Tournament in 2010, defeating Anderson Cooper.) While their goal is to pass the company along to their children\u2014some of Marin\u2019s and Chong\u2019s children work and own a piece of the company already\u2014selling the brand would be an ideal outcome.\n\u201cI would absolutely love to sell it, because I don't have enough time out here in the desert to smoke dope and play guitar,\u201d says Marin. \u201cI need more time. And if I sell the company, I could have more time.\u201d"

      "text": "An NCAA settlement introducing revenue sharing is set to strain school budgets. The most obvious solution: pass the cost on to the most loyal and deep-pocketed fans.\nAs the clock wound down on the 1949 Iron Bowl, with Auburn clinging to a 1-point lead over archrival Alabama at neutral-site Legion Field, the Tigers\u2019 star quarterback Travis Tidwell lined up hoping to rattle the Crimson Tide\u2019s kicker on an extra-point attempt. He couldn\u2019t quite get a finger on the ball, but the kick went wide all the same, giving Auburn one of its most famous wins ever and setting off a rowdy celebration from fans who ripped up their seat cushions and, in one case, even attempted to place a collect call to the queen of England.\nSeventy-five years later, that Tigers team\u2019s abandoned home locker room 100 miles across the state is hosting a new kind of party\u2014as one of Auburn\u2019s hottest tickets.\nLast fall, in an upgrade of the university\u2019s 86-year-old Jordan-Hare Stadium, Auburn unveiled three new premium seating options for its football games, including the Locker Room Club, a space evoking the Tidwell era beneath the stadium bowl with a capacity of about 350 fans. Building out the club and five field-level suites cost $1.6 million, but the project immediately paid dividends, with tickets selling out in three days and $1.2 million in gross revenue. The suites, sold on a single-game basis, ranged in price from $16,000 to $65,000 last season, and the returns continue to roll in as Auburn heads into the 2025 season with 50 additional club passes available and the cost of a yearlong club membership rising to $1,575\u2014not counting actual game tickets.\nAs the college football season begins in earnest on Saturday, Auburn\u2019s home field isn\u2019t the only one sporting a new look. Arizona State\u2019s Mountain America Stadium has new field-level loge boxes priced at $20,000 for four season tickets, for instance, while tiny James Madison has installed four field-level suites, along with a premium area of 564 seats. And more changes are in store for future seasons. Ohio State will debut a new premium seating section in 2026, Penn State is in the midst of a $700 million Beaver Stadium renovation that will add four levels of premium seating by 2027, and Ole Miss plans to introduce Founders Suites the same year, listed for a cool $5 million each.\nThe wave of construction reflects a new financial reality in college football that began with the NCAA\u2019s rule changes in 2021 to allow athletes to profit from their name, image and likeness. The intention was to permit endorsement deals in an otherwise amateur sport, but with an overhauled transfer portal simultaneously encouraging players to seek out the highest bidder, the result has been a nationwide arms race that at times has appeared indistinguishable from full-on pay-for-play, with coaches promising star recruits millions in compensation and boosters funneling cash to athletes through NIL \u201ccollectives.\u201d\nThe ante is being significantly raised this year in the wake of a June settlement in the House v. NCAA antitrust case, under which programs will be free to pay their athletes directly\u2014up to $20.5 million per school in 2025-26, and then incrementally more each year for a decade, on top of scholarships and other benefits already on offer.\nEven with students returning to campus just this month, the new system is already straining athletic department budgets. Virginia Tech\u2019s athletic director, Whit Babcock, recently warned that, for the Hokies to remain competitive, their athletic budget would need to leap to $200 million, from $144 million. Kentucky\u2019s athletic department, meanwhile, is expecting a net loss of nearly $31 million over the next two fiscal years, and LSU has more than tripled its football budget year-over-year. Many schools also have significant debt on their books already, with the Athletic recently reporting that eight Big Ten athletic departments owe more than $160 million each.\n\u201cEveryone in college athletics is trying to find ways to increase revenue streams to fully fund revenue sharing without sacrificing operational costs,\u201d says Rhett Hobart, Auburn\u2019s deputy athletics director for external affairs. And \u201cwhen you\u2019re looking at driving the most incremental revenue the quickest, your best way to do that is through premium seating. The demand is there, and the returns are immediate.\u201d\nWhile college athletic departments are looking increasingly professionalized\u2014hiring general managers to oversee multimillion-dollar rosters and bringing in corporate CEOs to bolster their business\u2014NCAA programs aren\u2019t necessarily able to pull all of the revenue levers that are available to their NFL counterparts. For example, while many college stadiums have begun selling beer and wine over the past decade, a 2023 Associated Press survey found that 20% of schools still prohibited alcohol sales in public areas. In addition, swaths of the stands are reserved for students on cheap ticket packages.\nSome schools are passing on their costs to students through higher fees\u2014$300 annually at South Carolina for an \u201cathletics auxiliary fee\u201d\u2014or plastering brand logos on the grass of their football fields under relaxed NCAA sponsorship rules. Private equity firms have also started to pitch their capital solutions to universities, and the Big Ten is exploring that option, perhaps in exchange for a percentage of future revenue. An alternative route would be lending, with Elevate, a New York-based sports consulting firm, recently announcing a $500 million fund to help colleges maximize their revenue\u2014which in most cases would presumably revolve around facility upgrades.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll come in and help a school understand what\u2019s the best product mix and pricing for the amount of capital they want to spend,\u201d says Jonathan Marks, the college and global marketplace chief business officer at Elevate, which also advises universities on ticketing and sponsorship strategies. \u201cWe can come in and help them monetize and maximize the opportunity to sell these spaces. You only have one shot to sell something that\u2019s new.\u201d\nThe appeal of luxury suites and premium clubs is clear: significantly more expensive tickets, as well as financial security because they are often sold on a season-long basis. And there is clearly demand waiting to be tapped, especially coming out of the Covid-19 pandemic, experts around the sports industry agree. Today\u2019s fans simply prefer more amenities\u2014even if that means attending fewer games.\n\u201cFans want to get closer to the game and to what they love,\u201d says Ed Horne, chief operating officer at hospitality provider On Location. \u201cYou want it to feel like a really seamless experience from when they get in the car to drive to the stadium to when they leave. The design of the facilities required to bring the premium opportunities to life is increasingly becoming an expectation as opposed to an aspiration.\u201d\nPro leagues long ago realized the importance of premium seating, and a recent evolution away from traditional luxury suites and toward a wider menu of offerings, including the small semiprivate groups of seats commonly known as loge boxes, has them making more money than ever. In the NFL, for instance, clubs averaged $55 million in premium seating revenue last season, about 70% as much as the revenue from general ticket sales despite representing a small fraction of the total attendance, according to Forbes estimates.\nBut there are important differences with premium seating at the college level, starting with the target customer. While the NFL typically caters to corporations and the ultra-rich with its premium sales, many college buyers are university donors or families tied to athletic foundations. Flavil Hampsten, Elevate\u2019s president of property sales, told Forbes last year that the firm had found that 34% of the fans buying premium tickets at one college had incomes below $100,000.\nAt Auburn, contributions to the Tigers Unlimited Foundation earn fans priority points that dictate the premium inventory that is available to them. The goal is to reward the most loyal donors, and turnover is rare, says Hobart, the deputy athletics director. In fact, many families hold on to the same tickets for decades.\nAuburn\u2019s Nelson Club, which features a view near midfield, now requires at least $1.1 million in lifetime giving for fans to secure four seats together\u2014up 80% from 2024, and 861% since 2017. Yet despite the high buy-in, the club continues to see growth. The North Club has seen similar appetite\u2014with the minimum contribution rising 52% since last year\u2014and Auburn has a list of 1,000 accounts, representing nearly 3,000 seats, of fans who have expressed interest in an elevated experience, including the sold-out clubs and loge boxes. There is also a waitlist of 100 accounts for suites, which are priced as high as $5,700 per person this season.\nThe challenge, though, is balance. After modeling demand as part of a stadium-wide recalibration, Auburn raised prices by about 10% on average this year but at the same time lowered prices in underperforming sections.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t sell out an event without the casual fan,\u201d says Elevate\u2019s Marks. \u201cWe\u2019re not just building amazing spaces anymore\u2014we\u2019re asking how to monetize square footage in a way that returns real profit. But you also have to keep the broader fan base engaged, or the ecosystem doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\nWith ticket sales remaining one of athletic departments\u2019 two biggest cash flows, along with conference TV revenue, Auburn\u2019s Hobart similarly calls out the importance of keeping a broad swath of fans coming to the stadium. That can include add-ons that don\u2019t quite rise to the level of a premium space, such as an upcharge for regular bleacher tickets that come with access to a buffet and a seat cushion.\n\u201cIt\u2019s never been easier to stay home and watch a game on TV where you have free parking and concessions,\u201d Hobart says. \u201cOur effort is to provide the best possible opportunity at varied price points while creating the best game-day experience that will have a fan desire to leave the simplicity of staying at home and come to our stadium and invest in our program.\u201d\nOne advantage that colleges have on the pros is a built-in, deeply loyal fan base of alumni, donors and families. That kind of connection also has universities thinking beyond game day, with ancillary events the Friday night before a football game that can turn the entire weekend into a monetizable experience while deepening fans\u2019 ties to the team.\n\u201cThe commitment to your university can be at a heightened level\u2014people will travel long distances to satisfy their fandom, and the college environment is perfect for that,\u201d says On Location\u2019s Horne. \u201cWhile the NFL owns Sunday, college sports owns Saturday. We\u2019re all about getting fans closer to the experiences, and we think that expansion is connected to that.\u201d"

      "text": "By Sherri Snelling, Next Avenue Contributor\nDavid Murdock, at age 90, has the look and energy of a man many years younger. The chairman of Dole Foods, the world's largest marketer of fruits and vegetables, has stated that he expects to live to 125, thanks to his lifestyle, diet and exercise regimen.\nIn the early 1980s, about the same time Murdock bought a controlling interest in the conglomerate of which Dole was a part, his wife, Gabriele, was ill with advanced-stage ovarian cancer. The couple spent nearly two years traveling the world seeking information about potential cures. After Gabriele died in 1985, at age 43, Murdock stuck with many of the healthy lifestyle habits the couple discovered during their quest. (Murdock also lost his mother to cancer, when he was 17 and she was 42.)\n(MORE: Embracing the Japanese Approach to Aging)\nMurdock, whose net worth is estimated by Forbes to be $2.4 billion, has also committed more than $500 million toward the creation of the North Carolina Research Campus and David H. Murdock Research Institute in Kannapolis, N.C. There, researchers from government, industry, non-profit groups and eight universities can take advantage of advanced technology and agricultural resources to collaborate on studies that explore the potential health benefits of plants in boosting longevity and warding off what the institute calls \"lifestyle-related disorders,\" like diabetes, obesity, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and cancer. The campus also supports public campaigns to promote healthy choices.\nHealthy Eating at 90 and Beyond\nMurdock, who has stuck to a mostly vegetarian diet since he was in his 60s, believes it's never too late for any of us to reap the benefits of adopting healthy nutritional habits. He eats approximately 20 servings of fruits and vegetables every day, mostly blended into smoothies, which he's quick to note are made with the foods' outer skin intact. Nothing the sun touches, he says, including banana peels and orange rinds, should be tossed, but blended into our meals for full nutritional value.\nThe mogul says he avoids vitamins and nutritional supplements, deriving an adequate balance of protein and carbohydrates from such foods as fish, beans, legumes and egg whites. Above all, he rejects fatty, empty calories. During one interview with The New York Times, he pushed away the butter dish delivered by a waiter, telling him, \"Please take death off the table.\"\nI recently met with Murdock at the California Health and Longevity Institute in the Southern California town of Westlake Village, a state-of-the-art spa, medical clinic and demonstration kitchen he opened in 2006. As he later told me, \"We take care of our vehicles \u2013 we're careful to put the proper kind of gasoline in the tank, put air in the tires, change the windshield wiper blades and brakes. But how many of us pay that much attention to what we put into our own bodies?\n(MORE: New Discovery May Reveal a Pathway to Longer Life)\n\"We have developed a culture in which we eat with our taste buds, not our brains,\" he told me. \"It is never too late to change the way you eat \u2014 once you do, your body will thank you with a longer and healthier life.\"\nMaking Every Day a Fit One\nWhen I first heard Murdock speak, at a UCLA Longevity Institute conference, I was intrigued by his prescription that society needs to embrace fun to engage people in consistent exercise. He cited the example of the Volkswagen Fun Theory initiative's \"Piano Staircase.\" In 2009, the stairs to a metro station in Sweden were transformed overnight into piano keys, with each step wired to make the sound of its corresponding note. The day before the switch, video cameras revealed, the vast majority of commuters used the escalator beside the stairway to enter and exit the station. The day after, nearly all took the new, more fun stairs.\nMurdock's goal is for all Americans to begin perceiving exercise not as an option or chore, but a pleasant part of their daily life. One way to get there, he says, is by mixing up our routines. Some days, Murdock rides his horses \u2013 admittedly not an option for everyone \u2013 but he makes sure to alternate riding days with others spent in yoga class or in weight training at his gym. He also believes time outdoors naturally encourages activity and exercise, citing research that revealed many people fail to stick to an exercise regimen because they believe exercise is something that only happens inside a gym.\n(MORE: 85-Year-Old Graduates From College, Finds Job)\nCaregiving is one of society's great equalizers. The stress of looking after a loved one who is declining or dying takes a physical, emotional and mental toll no matter the resources you can bring to bear. Murdock knows this from experience, his wife's final years, and he captivates audiences when he speaks at conferences about the time he spent caring for her. But Murdock is also convinced, as are so many experts in family caregiving, that caregivers must never let their own health decline if they want to effectively help their loved ones and remain as strong as possible for themselves.\n\"Don't give up,\" he says. \"Exercising and eating properly will build your physical and mental strength to endure the stressful situation.\"\nSherri Snelling, founder and chief executive of the Caregiving Club, is a nationally recognized expert on America's family caregivers and the author of A Cast of Caregivers \u2013 Celebrity Stories to Help You Prepare to Care (Balboa Press, 2013).\nMore from Next Avenue:"

      "text": "If the magnificent stocks at the top of the S&P 500 make you nervous, rearrange your portfolio.\nIndexitis: The nagging fear that too much of your net worth is invested in the S&P 500, and too much of that is invested in five exuberantly priced stocks.\nThe affliction is becoming more common. The popular index has 28% of its value in Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Meta Platforms (i.e., Facebook). This is twice the top-five concentration level the index has had historically.\nHerewith are five cures for indexitis, ranging from a modest tweak to your choice of stock index fund to a dramatic move into one very interesting bond.\nIndex investing is not necessarily a bad idea, and the market is not necessarily acting irrationally in putting high price tags on fast-growing tech firms. It is a tribute to the success of passive investing, to the investment company founded by the late John Bogle and to the popularity of artificial intelligence chips that we have a fund with a $107 billion holding in one stock. That\u2019s the Vanguard S&P 500 fund\u2019s position in Nvidia.\nBut history tells us that mighty fortresses crumble. Forty years ago, the top three U.S. companies in market value were IBM, Exxon and General Electric. Their locations in today\u2019s 500 are at positions 34, 14 and 26.\nHere are five ways to take a step back from the S&P 500. Important assumption: You\u2019re rebalancing inside a tax-deferred account. In a taxable account with unrealized gains, the smart thing to do is nothing.\nMethod 1: Go total market\nReplace your S&P 500 index fund with a fund that owns the whole U.S. stock market. Customers of Fidelity Investments have access to the best deal, its Zero Total Stock Market fund, with a 0% expense ratio. Ticker: FZROX.\nWithout a Fidelity account you\u2019re better off in an exchange-traded fund; these can be held at any brokerage. Vanguard, Schwab and BlackRock (iShares) all have total market ETFs priced at 0.03% per year, meaning you pay $3 a year per $10,000 invested. Tickers, respectively: VTI, SCHB and ITOT.\nThe total market funds have roughly 80% of their assets in the S&P 500. All you are accomplishing with this switch is adding a small allocation to smaller companies. The Fidelity fund has 2,100 of these small stocks, the Vanguard fund 3,000.\nYou can find these alternative index funds in the domestic stock chapter of the Forbes Fund Finder.\nMethod 2: Go international\nIn lieu of a U.S.-only stock portfolio, you could have one that blends U.S. and foreign stocks. Obvious choice: the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT, expense 0.06%). This fund has two-thirds of its money in North America, the rest abroad.\nVT\u2019s portfolio of 9,980 stocks starts out looking like the S&P 500, with Nvidia at the top, but as you scroll down you\u2019ll see names like Taiwan Semiconductor and Tencent Holdings.\nMethod 3: Go foreign\nInstead of accepting Vanguard\u2019s 34% allocation to stocks on other continents, you could set your own percentage by moving some money to a purely foreign portfolio.\nThere are several good ETFs to pick from. Cheapest: SPDR Portfolio Developed World ex-U.S. (SPDW, 0.03%). It has 2,350 stocks, starting with ASML, which makes the machines that Taiwan Semiconductor uses to make chips for Nvidia.\nMethod 4: Go small\nThere are several low-cost ETFs that hold only small-capitalization stocks, or only small- and mid-cap. Cheapest: SPDR Portfolio S&P 600 Small Cap (SPSM, 0.03%). Its largest position is in Mr. Cooper Group, a fast-moving mortgage lender.\nMethod 5: Buy a bond\nOver the past five years, as the S&P 500 has almost doubled, one thing has gotten cheaper: a long-term inflation-protected bond. With a bond, \u201ccheap\u201d is synonymous with \u201chigh-yielding.\u201d\nIn August 2020, a 20-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) was yielding -0.6%, which is to say, the government was charging you money for letting you lend to it. Now the yield is 2.5%, a huge 3.1-point swing in your favor. That\u2019s a real yield, not to be compared with the nominal yield you see on a bank account or corporate bond.\nThere are very good TIPS ETFs on the market but they tend to have short-term bonds. For a concentrated bet (and for a better real yield), go long.\nIf you have at least $100,000 to invest, buy a TIPS in the secondary market. One that I like (because the bid/ask spread was narrow) is the 0.875% due in February 2047. At Fidelity it was recently quoted at 71.968 bid, 72.093 ask. These market prices must be multiplied by an inflation factor, and the bottom line on a ticket for 100 bonds (that is, $100,000 of par value when issued) would have been $96,470.\nThese numbers are bit confusing, so here\u2019s what counts. The real yield to maturity came to 2.57% for a buyer. The yield spread was 1 basis point (one-hundredth of a percentage point). If we presume that the true value is midway between bid and ask, you are in effect coughing up half a basis point of annual return to the middleman. That\u2019s a better deal than the 3 basis points you pay to own an ETF, at least if you hold the bond to maturity.\nLong Treasury bonds are risky, because real rates could go still higher (making the bond\u2019s value go down), and because the Treasury might default. But bonds are a lot less risky than today\u2019s tippy toppy S&P 500."

      "text": "Boomers and their elders control $93 trillion, or two-thirds of America\u2019s household wealth. Forbes 400 members Phil Knight, Charles Koch, Barry Diller and Harold Hamm give a master class in how to make sure your money goes to charity and children.\nBy Matt Durot, Forbes Staff\n\u201cThere\u2019s four seasons in Oregon: fall, winter, spring and smoke,\u201d laments Nike cofounder Phil Knight, 85.\nSpeaking in August from his home in the center of the state, he estimates that because of wildfires, visibility out his windows is limited to 100 yards. \u201cIt\u2019s the most beautiful state in the world, so to have it devastated by smoke is heartbreaking. I\u2019ve spent a little money looking into it, and controlling these fires on the West Coast is very doable.\u201d\nA bold claim. But Knight admits there\u2019s a task he\u2019s finding much harder than anticipated: giving away the bulk of his $39.5 billion fortune. \u201cIdentifying smart philanthropic bets has not been as easy as I might wish, and I expect that my successors and advisors will have a lot of wood to chop when I am no longer able to source new ideas,\u201d he muses. \u201cI\u2019m not in a hurry.\u201d\nKnight is focused on ensuring family and philanthropy\u2014not the taxman\u2014get his wealth. There is a theoretical 40% estate tax looming, but like other members of The Forbes 400, he\u2019s determined it won\u2019t take a big bite from his fortune. \u201cThat\u2019s the art form. I talk to my financial advisor all the time, and that\u2019s one of the subjects we talk about endlessly,\u201d he says. \u201cMy philosophy is that if I do this right, the charities I give to will use that money better than the government will. So I give to them with a completely clear conscience.\u201d So far he has donated $3.4 billion, mainly to the University of Oregon (a science center and basketball arena), Oregon Health & Science University (a cancer research center) and Stanford (international grad student fellowships, a business school building and research on cognitive decline).\nAmerica\u2019s Baby Boomers (born between 1946 and 1964), along with surviving members of older generations, are about to fuel the greatest wealth transfer of all time. In the U.S. today, according to the Federal Reserve, Boomers control a stunning $75 trillion and their elders another $18 trillion of the nation\u2019s $141 trillion in total household wealth. Yes, some middle-class retirees will spend their savings and die broke. But wealth in the U.S. has become increasingly concentrated, with the richest 1% holding 31% of net assets\u2014meaning most one-percenters (minimum net worth $10 million) will leave plenty to their children, grandchildren and favorite causes.\nThat\u2019s particularly true for the very richest. Out of 88 million living Americans born before 1965, Forbes has identified 572 U.S. billionaires\u2014the 0.0007%. We estimate they have a collective net worth of $3.9 trillion to pass on. The death tax? \u201cOnly morons pay the estate tax,\u201d former Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn famously quipped while serving as President Donald Trump\u2019s chief economic advisor.\nMake no mistake, the estate tax used to be a real revenue raiser. But a quarter-century of political, regulatory and court decisions\u2014and the ingenuity of private lawyers\u2014have eviscerated it. Congress has raised the amount that a married couple can pass on to heirs without owing estate or gift taxes from $1.35 million in 2000 to almost $26 million this year. The full $26 million can now even go into a generation-skipping or dynasty trust\u2014meaning it can grow in value for grandkids (or later generations) without any further gift or estate tax owed. Plus, any assets someone still owns at death get a step-up in basis, so no capital gains tax is due on appreciation to that point.\nThe result: Only 0.04% of deaths resulted in estate taxes in 2020, down from 2.18% in 2000. True, under current law, the estate exemption will fall by about half in 2026, when the temporary Trump tax cuts from 2017 expire. But the IRS has agreed that if that happens, it won\u2019t attempt to claw back (and then tax) money already transferred during life using the larger exemption.\nFor billionaires and centimillionaires, even more relief comes from an alphabet soup of wealth transfer techniques, used in ever more creative and aggressive combinations: GRATs, FLPs, IDGTs, GSTs, CLTs, ILITs, IDFs. Some plans get extra juice from intrafamily loans. Others deeply discount the value of transferred assets based on theories of why lack of marketability or control makes them worth less. In their annual menus of tax-the-rich ideas, Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden have proposed clamping down on some of these ploys. But that didn\u2019t happen while Democrats held both houses of Congress. It\u2019s a nonstarter now.\nOne way the rich have long been applauded for avoiding taxes is through philanthropy\u2014far easier to love than a loophole. Industrialist Andrew Carnegie, who campaigned for the modern estate tax, gave away nearly 90% of his money\u2014about $6 billion in current terms\u2014before his death in 1919, leaving the balance to the nonprofit Carnegie Corp. \u201cThe man who dies thus rich dies disgraced,\u201d he wrote in his 1889 essay \u201cThe Gospel of Wealth.\u201d\n\u201cYou want to get it to the point where when you die, your heirs don\u2019t have to sell the company to pay taxes.\u201d\nHarold Hamm, founder, Continental Resources\nIn a toned-down modern version of that, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates in 2010 created the Giving Pledge, which requires signers to devote the majority of their wealth to charitable causes during life or at death. Since then, 104 current American billionaires worth $1.5 trillion (including 77 born before 1965 who are worth $950 billion) have signed. But not all giving is purely charitable. Recently, a new breed of \u201csocial welfare\u201d nonprofits has started clouding the meaning of philanthropy, since these organizations can engage in unlimited issue lobbying and substantial direct political activity\u2014things traditional charities can\u2019t do.\nHere, four members of The Forbes 400 share the moves they\u2019ve made to cement their legacies and ensure their wealth goes to family and favored causes\u2014techniques that can work for those of lesser means, too. The four are aged 77 to 87, making them members of the (pre-Boomer) Silent Generation. They were anything but silent when discussing their legacies. Our professors are Knight; Charles Koch, the free-market libertarian worth $54.5 billion; Harold Hamm, the truck driver turned fracking king worth $25.2 billion; and TV whiz cum internet entrepreneur Barry Diller, who is the poorest at $4.1 billion\u2014and the only Democrat. Diller is candid and unrepentant about having used a tax-saving technique he considers bad policy. \u201cYou live within the tax code, and if it says you can do this or that, and it\u2019s in the broad mainstream, why would any sentient person act another way?\u201d\nCHARLES KOCH\nclimbs the stairs just before the sun comes up in Wichita, Kansas, to his third-floor office at the headquarters of Koch Industries, the $125 billion (2022 revenue) conglomerate of which he\u2019s chairman and co-CEO. Overlooking him is a bust of his father, company founder Fred Koch, who died in 1967 at age 67. Charles was 32 when he took the reins.\nAsked why he still works at 87, Koch invokes psychologist Abraham Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of human needs, the highest of which is self-actualization. Then he segues into a more down-to-earth explanation. \u201cI have retired friends at the club I belong to in Palm Springs who play nine holes every morning, have lunch and play gin all afternoon. If I did that, I\u2019d put a bullet in my head. I wouldn\u2019t need to because I\u2019d be dead in six months. That\u2019s not living.\u201d Koch\u2019s son Chase, 46, says his father\u2019s passion for both business and social change keep him going. \u201cHe works out six days a week and he\u2019s pretty healthy, knock on wood.\u201d\nThat hasn\u2019t kept Koch from nearly completing his plans for after he\u2019s gone. He has already transferred to Chase and to daughter Elizabeth, 47, equal amounts of his nonvoting Koch shares. After Charles\u2019 death, Chase will get all his father\u2019s voting stock, giving him 42% control. (The heirs to Charles\u2019 brother David, who died in 2019, also have 42%.)\nThis past March, Dave Robertson, 61, a Koch Industries lifer, was named co-CEO with Charles. A transition figure to Chase? \u201cI don\u2019t want to take anything off the table,\u201d says Chase, who was promoted to executive vice-president in March. But he adds that his current role heading up Koch Disruptive Technologies, a venture capital subsidiary, is where he can \u201cadd the most value\u201d now. \u201cWe don\u2019t think about it as a family business. We think about it more as a meritocracy. As soon as we start thinking about it like \u2018the next Koch needs to have this role or that role,\u2019 I think we\u2019re in trouble.\u201d\nCharles Koch says his kids didn\u2019t get all his nonvoting shares; the rest will go to fund his charities and causes, after his wife, Liz, 78, is provided for. He hasn\u2019t signed the Giving Pledge and won\u2019t disclose the family/charity split.\nBut he has already made a big, and previously unreported, move. Last year he gave $4.3 billion of nonvoting Koch stock to Believe in People, a Wichita-based not-for-profit created under section 501(c)(4) of the tax code, a broad category of \u201csocial welfare\u201d organizations that includes everything from volunteer fire companies to the National Rifle Association and the American Civil Liberties Union. In contrast to a traditional 501(c)(3) charity, a C4 can own an entire company indefinitely and (so long as these activities support its principal purpose) engage in an unlimited amount of lobbying; get directly involved in politics; and benefit private individuals.\nThere\u2019s no income tax or estate tax deduction for giving money to a C4, as there is to a C3, but in 2015 Congress made a crucial tweak to the law that a Koch lobbyist promoted. That change exempted transfers to a C4 from the gift tax. So a living billionaire (or anyone else) can therefore give a C4 a big gift of highly appreciated stock without paying either gift or capital gains tax. The C4 can then sell the stock, capital gains tax\u2013free, or hold on to it indefinitely, reaping the dividends.\nWhile a few billionaires have put their entire companies into C4s, Koch\u2019s $4.3 billion gift to Believe in People is the largest, in dollar terms, to a C4 that we know of. The C4 is run by Chase, Robertson and Brian Hooks, who coauthored Charles Koch\u2019s fourth book, Believe in People: Bottom-Up Solutions for a Top-Down World (2020). Hooks, 45, also heads Stand Together, a network of Koch-funded charities and policy organizations. In addition, in 2020, Koch donated $975 million of nonvoting shares to CCKc4, a C4 run by Chase. The two newly funded C4s have as their stated purpose advancing human progress as defined in Koch\u2019s books. Under the separate Stand Together umbrella: the nearly two-decade-old Americans for Prosperity, a C4 \u201cgrassroots\u201d organization that has spent tens of millions a year on policy and politics, including opposing President Obama\u2019s reelection. A political action committee affiliated with AFP (AFP Action) is now opposing both Biden and Trump.\nSee Here For Details On The More Than $5 Billion Of Stock That Charles Koch Gave Away\nPlus: Forbes\u2019 Exclusive Interview With Charles Koch On The Future Of Koch Industries\nKoch, the staunch libertarian, has supported an array of policies that includes cutting taxes and regulations, criminal justice reform and marijuana legalization. While emphasizing that he doesn\u2019t make the decisions at AFP or AFP Action, he offers this shot: \u201cWhat I think is very dangerous, very destructive for our country is that both parties are becoming increasingly authoritarian.\u201d\nAFTER\nspending his summer yachting in the Mediterranean, Barry Diller, the founder and chairman of internet and media conglomerate IAC, returned to his Manhattan office this September to argue that the tax code is unfair to those who can\u2019t afford a yacht. \u201cThis idea that capital deserves protection while working people\u2019s salaries don\u2019t is a monstrosity,\u201d he says.\nOne giveaway to the rich the 81-year-old particularly hates: the grantor retained annuity trust, a popular tool for transferring appreciating assets to heirs tax-free. \u201cGRATs should be abolished,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard any reason for them that has any social underpinning.\u201d But they\u2019re now mainstream, so he has used them. In addition to the $400 million of stock in Expedia (it was spun off from IAC) Diller currently holds in GRATs, he has transferred more than $1 billion of other assets through GRATs to different trusts for his heirs. \u201cI\u2019m in the center lane on this,\u201d he says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have lawyers looking for [new loopholes]. Some of my friends spend an excruciating amount of time on this. We don\u2019t do that.\u201d\nOne variation: the Walton GRAT, also known as a zeroed-out GRAT. Walmart cofounder Bud Walton\u2019s ex-wife, Audrey Walton, won a tax court case in 2000 allowing it. A parent puts stock or other assets in a trust for his kids and takes back an annuity (which can pay out in stock) calculated to equal the present value of everything he just put in the trust\u2014assuming, that is, that the assets grow no faster than a low statutory interest rate, known as the 7520 rate. That rate was an absurdly low 1.6% a year for GRATs set up in February 2022, before the Federal Reserve started raising rates. If the GRAT assets grow faster than 1.6%, there\u2019s real wealth left in the trust for the kids (even though the parent got all his money back), gift tax\u2013free. Because this works only if the parent outlives the term of the GRAT, this is typically done with a series of overlapping GRATs lasting two to ten years. A side benefit: The parent pays any income tax owed by the GRAT (on stock dividends or capital gains, say), effectively increasing what\u2019s left for the kids.\nAlthough he\u2019s a Giving Pledge signatory, Diller still plans to leave his kids big bucks. \u201cI believe that what Warren Buffet and others have said about not leaving your children wealthy because it ruins ambition is wrongheaded,\u201d says Diller, who grew up in an upper-middle-class family in Beverly Hills, dropped out of college and started in the mailroom at the William Morris Agency. \u201cThey\u2019re either ambitious or they\u2019re not. I don\u2019t believe money particularly motivates ambition anyway.\u201d He himself was the wunderkind CEO of Paramount Pictures and then Fox before deciding at 50 that he wanted to own his own company.\nHe involves his kids in his charity work, too. \u201cBefore [the Giving Pledge] was public, Warren Buffett called and asked if we\u2019d consider being in the initial group. I said, \u2018I\u2019ll ask my son, since he\u2019s the one most directly affected,\u2019 \u201d he recalls. That son is Prince Alex von Furstenberg, 53, one of two children from his wife\u2019s first marriage (to a German prince). Diller married Diane von Furstenberg, the famed fashion designer, in 2000. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of an idiot savant of investing,\u201d Diller says of Alex, who manages the Diller\u2013von Furstenberg family office and who urged his stepfather to sign the pledge.\nSo far, Diller has doled out $430 million to charity, including more than $300 million to develop Little Island, a public park on an artificial island in the Hudson River off Manhattan, with garden paths and an amphitheater. It opened in 2021 after years of legal challenges and cost overruns. The park was Diller\u2019s baby. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved public art and public spaces,\u201d he says. Alex and his sister, Princess Tatiana von Furstenberg, 52, along with their mother, serve on the board of the family\u2019s charitable foundation; each, Diller insists, has veto power over major spending. As for the kids\u2019 charitable interests, Alex has already spent millions of his own money promoting plans to help poor Americans build wealth. \u201cHe cares so much about inequality,\u201d Diller says.\n\u201cTHE ESTATE TAX\nis a big consideration,\u201d Phil Knight says candidly. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s one big reason I\u2019m giving most of it away, because I can get more bang for my buck that way than the other way.\u201d The other way, of course, is a chunk going to Uncle Sam in the form of estate or gift taxes. Oregon, where he\u2019s the richest resident, also has a 16% estate tax he\u2019s keen to avoid.\nThe Beaver State has benefited from his philanthropy, however, with Knight\u2019s alma mater, the University of Oregon, the largest recipient so far. He ran track there, served a year in the Army, earned a Stanford MBA, surfed and sold encyclopedias in Hawaii on his way to Japan (where he secured U.S. import rights to a line of running shoes) and became a CPA\u2014all before starting Nike in 1964 with his college running coach. He dismisses accusations that he has wielded excessive influence at the school. But he isn\u2019t oblivious to criticism; it explains why he hasn\u2019t signed the Giving Pledge. \u201cI thought with local media being quick to criticize, they would look and say \u2018You\u2019re not giving it away very fast.\u2019\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to rush it. I\u2019ve elected to focus on big causes that can have a big impact,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit the opposite of [Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\u2019 ex-wife] MacKenzie Scott, who has quickly contributed so much to hundreds of different charities and done a lot of good. But there\u2019s a lot of them in a hurry.\u201d Responsibility for continuing his charity, Knight says, will fall first to Penny, his wife of 55 years, who \u201cis 10 years younger than I am and in better shape.\u201d Then son Travis, 50, will make decisions. A former rapper (stage name: Chilly Tee), Travis now runs Laika, an Oregon-based animation studio his father gained control of in 2002.\nIn his 2016 memoir, Shoe Dog, Knight expressed regret about not spending more time with his two sons while building Nike. (His older son, Matthew, died while scuba diving in 2004.) Now he\u2019s spending time with Travis, talking philanthropy. That process, Knight concedes, \u201cis actually in its infancy now, because we just started over the last couple of years to talk about those things. I\u2019m still making the decisions, but he\u2019s at my elbow while I\u2019m making them.\u201d Travis has been learning the ropes at Nike, too. In 2015 he joined the board as part of a succession plan; his dad stepped down the next year. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt that my position on the board is sort of as a guardian of the culture,\u2019\u2019 Travis says.\nKnight used GRATs to move shares now worth $3.8 billion to a trust in Travis\u2019 name. Another Knight maneuver, involving a family LLC called Swoosh, has brought the total value of shares transferred to trusts for his heirs to $4.4 billion, according to securities filings and an analysis by Bob Lord, a tax attorney and senior advisor to Patriotic Millionaires, a group favoring higher taxes on the rich.\nWhile Travis\u2019 trust now has voting control of the family\u2019s nearly 20% stake (worth $29.8 billion) in Nike, 85% of the shares are technically owned by Phil Knight. Lord points out that he could use testamentary charitable lead annuity trusts (CLATs)\u2014a well-established option\u2014to reduce or eliminate estate tax on this remaining wealth. As with a Walton GRAT, a CLAT can be \u201czeroed out.\u201d The charities get annuity payments for a fixed number of years calculated to exhaust the present value of the assets put into the CLAT\u2014assuming they don\u2019t earn more than that low 7520 interest rate. If they do earn more, heirs are left with the trust\u2019s remaining assets at the end, without any estate taxes. A spokesman for Knight acknowledges CLATs are a \u201cviable option,\u201d but adds that \u201cno such plan is presently contemplated.\u201d\nKnight could also leave those shares to his wife estate tax\u2013free (under the unlimited marital exemption) and defer further planning to her. When asked what percentage of his wealth he\u2019ll leave to charity, he tells Forbes, \u201cIt\u2019s certainly way more than 51%. It\u2019s certainly not 90%. It\u2019s somewhere in between. Ultimately those final decisions will be decided after I\u2019m gone. Penny and Travis are on the same page, and they will make the decisions on a lot of the amount that\u2019s given.\u201d\n\u201cMONEY DOESN\u2019T\ndrive him at all,\u201d says Shelly Lambertz, Continental Resources\u2019 chief culture and administrative officer, of her 77-year-old father, Harold Hamm, the business\u2019 founder. \u201cHe loves the company. It\u2019s his first and favorite child. His identity.\u201d Hamm, the 13th child of Oklahoma sharecroppers, picked cotton barefoot, worked as an oil field truck driver after high school, began drilling wells when he was 25 and went on to lead America\u2019s fracking revolution.\nHe says his top priority right now is generating cash to pay off the $4.3 billion he borrowed to take Continental private in a $27 billion (enterprise value) LBO last November. By then, he had already transferred half the family\u2019s Continental stake (now worth an estimated $25 billion) to trusts benefiting his five children. That took 25 years of working with lawyers and a complicated series of transactions that involved a family LLC, loans to the trusts and valuation discounts. \u201cThe biggest key is to start early, when the company is small, before the growth has occurred and the value is created,\u201d he says. \u201cYou want to get it to the point where when you die, [your heirs] don\u2019t have to sell the company to pay taxes.\u201d Going private wasn\u2019t an estate planning move, he notes, but an economic decision based on the market acting \u201clike oil and gas didn\u2019t exist anymore after 2020.\u201d\nSo far, Hamm has donated around $200 million\u2014less than 1% of his wealth\u2014to charity for diabetes research, an energy institute and other causes. In 2011, he signed the Giving Pledge with his second wife; three years later he wrote her a $975 million divorce settlement check and swore never to remarry. He\u2019s no keener to share with the IRS. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen anything to lead me to believe that the government has done very well with the money America has already given them.\u201d\nAdditional reporting by Chris Helman\nNote: This story was updated on October 30, 2023 to note that billionaires account for 0.0007% of the American population born before 1965.

      "text": "When it comes to selling coconut water to the health obsessed, New York\u2019s Vita Coco has served up a master class, schooling even giant rivals like Coke and Pepsi. Its next test will be withstanding Trump\u2019s tariff shocks.\nWhat do you do when 96% of your revenue comes from coconut water and 100% of your supply comes from tropical countries targeted by Donald Trump with high tariffs?\nThis is exactly the situation confronting one of the nation\u2019s hottest small cap companies today, $516 million (revs) Vita-Coco of New York City, the leading maker of coconut water. Its biggest source of coconuts, has heretofore been Brazil, a country now squarely in the crosshairs of a proposed 50% tariff, courtesy of the Trump administration. Its six other sources for coconuts aren\u2019t much better: Philippines (tariff: 19%), Malaysia (19%), Vietnam (20%), Indonesia (19%) Thailand (19%) and Sri Lanka (20%).\nStill, you wouldn\u2019t know that Vita Coco was facing a Trump tariff nightmare given the company\u2019s bullish tone\u2014or its stock performance. Shares are up nearly 32% over the past 12 months, outperforming many better-known consumer-staples names. Even with the stock down roughly 5% year-to-date as the broader market rallies, Wall Street is shrugging off Vita Coco\u2019s inevitable pricing pressure.\n\u201cBrazil is really a nonissue for us [if enacted],\u201d insists co-founder and executive chairman Michael Kirban. \u201cWe started working on reallocating our Brazil supply, which historically goes to the United States, to supply Europe and Canada, several weeks ago.\u201d The main source of supply for Europe, meanwhile\u2014the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Malaysia\u2014will now all shift to the U.S. \u201cThis is something we can pull the trigger on really quickly,\u201d reasons Kirban, seemingly unconcerned about the high tariffs in his alternative source countries.\nHe goes on: \u201cWith decreasing ocean freight rates and pricing [increases] we took earlier this year to mitigate the initial 10% baseline tariffs, we think we are in a good position.\u201d Co-founder Kirban says he doesn\u2019t expect to pass any further price hikes in the coming months, but this may be wishful thinking if Trump doesn't back away from his harsh tariffs on tropical countries.\nHere is what Vita Coco CEO Martin Roper said on the Q2 earnings call held a few weeks ago: \u201cOur planned U.S.-based price increase in May to cover inflationary cost of goods pressures produced an approximately 7% increase at U.S. food retailers according to Circana over the quarter.\u201d However the May price increase does not include another recent price increase implemented in the current quarter, which Vita Coco management refuses to provide Forbes details on.\nFor now, Wall Street is putting its faith in Vita Coco management.\nBy working with seven of the largest coconut processors in the world, Vita Coco currently controls roughly 40% of the U.S. coconut-water market, far ahead of smaller competitors like Goya and Harmless Harvest. \u201cCoca-Cola tried to enter this market, buying Zico, and Pepsi also failed,\u201d Larry Carlin, an equity analyst at $8 billion (assets) Conestoga Capital Advisors who is hopeful that Vita Coco\u2019s strong position will give it more flexibility in the face of looming tariffs. \u201cThey\u2019ve developed a supply chain with substantial barriers to entry,\u201d adds Carlin.\nFounded by two friends in 2003 after a chance bar room encounter in Manhattan, Vita Coco\u2019s met with early success in its first decade, thanks in part to celebrity investors including Madonna, Demi Moore, and Matthew McConaughey. However about a decade into their journey growing pains hit\u2014thin margins, distribution hiccups and a rocky 2021 IPO kept many institutions away.\nBut over the past two years the company has executed a disciplined turnaround, tightening its supply chain after the Covid pandemic. It has also expanded its portfolio of offerings into protein-infused PWR LIFT, aluminum-canned Ever & Ever water, and most recently, the coconut-milk-based beverage line Vita Coco Treats. Up until the onslaught of Trump\u2019s tariffs, Vita-Coco was the envy of the Russell 2000, appearing near the top of Forbes Best Small Companies ranking in 2024. The stock is up 133% since its IPO, and five-fold from its low in 2022.\nOn the company\u2019s second quarter earnings call, held July 30th, CFO Corey Baker noted that Vita Coco is pursuing a formal tariff exemption request with U.S. trade officials. If that isn\u2019t granted, management basically told shareholders to brace themselves: \u201cIf [the 50% Brazilian tariff is] enacted, we would ultimately need to pass through price increases,\u201d says Baker. \u201cEven under a worst-case scenario, we believe we could pass through price if necessary while maintaining share.\u201d\nOn Wall Street, six of the ten analysts covering Vita Coco rate it a \u201cbuy\u201d, while the other four give it a \u201chold\u201d rating, often interpreted as \u201csell\u201d by investors. Short sellers have begun to circle its stock.\nA 23-page March 2025 report by UK-based short-seller NINGI Research accused Vita Coco of numerous underlying business problems including failed attempts at diversification, supply chain foul ups and millions in CEO and insider stock sales. NINGI\u2019s main argument was that the company was an unsustainable growth story: \u201cVita Coco is nothing more than a one-trick pony\" and an \"operational basket case,\u201d it wrote. The report's most impactful claims were that Vita Coco had lost its large private-label contract with Costco due to supply chain mismanagement, which would lead to a significant revenue hit.\nWhile Vita Coco publicly refuted the report as containing \"inaccuracies and mischaracterizations,\" subsequent public statements and financial results support NINGI\u2019s allegations about the lost Costco contract. The company's Q2 2025 earnings report confirmed a significant 36.5% decline in private-label sales.\nToday, a 12-pack of Costco's own in-house private label brand, Kirkland Signature coconut water, sells for $12.99 versus $19.59 for a 12 pack of Vita Coco at Target. Vita Coco has also publicly acknowledged that inventory constraints in 2024 led to \"unacceptable private label service levels.\" Despite these issues, Vita Coco bulls maintain that the company\u2019s core branded coconut water business is strong.\nEver the optimist, Kirban is unfazed. \u201cSales are continuing to perform really nicely. So I think consumers are willing to pay,\u201d says Kirban, referring to his tariff related price hikes. \u201cThis is a product that comes from a tree. It's not created in a lab, and it is three and a half times the electrolytes of the leading sport drink.\u201d"

      "text": "Lucrative endorsements and a stake in shoe brand On have made the Swiss star just the seventh athlete in the three-comma club\u2014and a food tech investment may serve up another payday.\nIn 2019, Roger Federer stood at center court in Basel, Switzerland, with gold confetti raining from above and tears streaming down his face. The show of emotion was natural after a straight-sets victory in the final at his hometown tournament, the Swiss Indoors, where he had once served as a ball boy. But it also seemed to reflect a growing awareness that, at age 38, he might not have many more such moments as a professional tennis player.\nIn fact, that trophy proved to be the last one that Federer would ever hoist, with injuries severely limiting his final three years on the ATP Tour before he finally hung up his racket in September 2022. But even though Federer, now 44, never added another piece of hardware to a collection that also included 20 Grand Slam singles titles and two Olympic medals, he remained tennis\u2019 highest-paid player all the way to the end\u2014and into retirement. Now, Forbes estimates that Federer is a billionaire, with a net worth of $1.1 billion thanks in part to his significant minority stake in publicly traded Swiss shoe and apparel brand On.\nFederer\u2014whose father, from a prominent Swiss family, and whose mother, raised in South Africa, both worked for a pharmaceutical company\u2014started playing tennis at age 3. He became the world\u2019s top-ranked junior player and, after turning pro in 1998, made his breakthrough in 2003 by claiming the singles title at Wimbledon. Over his 24-year ATP Tour career, Federer spent 310 weeks as the top-ranked men\u2019s singles player and won 103 tournaments while hauling in nearly $131 million in prize money\u2014still the third-best total in tennis history, behind only his rivals Novak Djokovic ($189 million) and Rafael Nadal ($135 million).\nFederer was even more successful off the court, collecting roughly $1 billion (before taxes and agents\u2019 fees) from endorsements, appearances and other business endeavors during his tennis career, more than double what Djokovic or Nadal has pocketed, according to Forbes estimates. With an unmatched sponsor portfolio that included several brands that stuck with him for more than a decade, Federer was the world\u2019s highest-paid tennis player for 16 straight years and in 2020 led all sports with an estimated $106.3 million in total pretax earnings.\nFederer stands as one of just seven athletes to have crossed $1 billion in career pretax income while active in their sport, along with Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James, golfers Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, soccer players Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, and boxer Floyd Mayweather.\nNow, as a billionaire, Federer is part of an equally exclusive group, as only the seventh high-level athlete to join the three-comma club. The first was another tennis player, Ion Tiriac, who won the 1970 French Open men\u2019s doubles championship and also played hockey for his native Romania at the 1964 Winter Olympics. Tiriac, who began investing after the fall of communism, joined the billionaires list in 2007 and has an estimated net worth of $2.3 billion, with interests in real estate, car dealerships and financial services.\nHe was followed in 2014 by Basketball Hall of Famer Michael Jordan\u2014now worth an estimated $3.8 billion\u2014and later by Lakers great Magic Johnson, worth an estimated $1.5 billion, and former Milwaukee Bucks sixth man Junior Bridgeman, who had a $1.4 billion fortune when he died in March. James (worth an estimated $1.2 billion) and Woods ($1.3 billion) are the only athletes to have joined the three-comma club while still active in their sports.\nWorld\u2019s Highest-Paid Tennis Players 2025\nVIEW THE FULL LIST\nFederer\u2019s business success starts with his marketing appeal. A carefully cultivated stable of sponsors that has long included Lindt, Mercedes-Benz, Rolex and Mo\u00ebt & Chandon made him synonymous with luxury, dovetailing with his elegant style of tennis and his spotless reputation.\n\u201cBetween his character and his likability, that\u2019s a big thing,\u201d says Lisa Delpy Neirotti, director of the sport management program at George Washington University. \u201cYou may be a great athlete on the field, but not everyone likes you. He\u2019s kind of debonair. He\u2019s got good looks. He\u2019s very polite. He\u2019s sophisticated, and his brands reflect that.\u201d\nFederer leveraged that allure in 2018 when he left Nike\u2014which had paid him roughly $150 million over two decades\u2014to sign an apparel deal with Japanese brand Uniqlo for a reported $300 million over ten years. And because Uniqlo doesn\u2019t make tennis footwear\u2014leaving open a sponsor category that Nike would have blocked as a matter of brand exclusivity\u2014Federer was then able to pounce on an even more lucrative opportunity with the Zurich-based On.\nFederer first learned about the company when his wife started wearing its sneakers, and he soon reached out to On\u2019s founders, David Allemann, Olivier Bernhard and Caspar Coppetti. In 2019, Federer took an equity stake in the up-and-coming business, which at the time was focused on running shoes.\nHe wasn\u2019t content to be a passive investor, either, agreeing to help the brand develop an on-court tennis shoe and a lifestyle apparel line. The gamble paid off in just two years as On went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2021, with Federer holding a stake estimated at around 3%. The company now has a market capitalization of nearly $15 billion, and its shares are up 86% from the IPO price, making Federer\u2019s equity worth more than $375 million.\n\u201cRoger was the accelerator,\u201d Marc Maurer, then On\u2019s co-CEO, told Forbes in 2023. \u201cWe basically wanted to open the door, and we were clear that tennis is the next sport. We were very fortunate that Roger embarked on that mission together with us.\u201d\nFederer has served up impressive returns with some of his other investments as well. In 2013, he cofounded management company Team8 alongside his longtime agent, Tony Godsick, and four years later, they created the Laver Cup, an annual team tennis tournament that pits six European men against six players from the rest of the world. The event, now a sanctioned stop on the ATP Tour and a consistent draw for big-name talent, has consistently been profitable\u2014with the exception of 2023, when it made infrastructure improvements\u2014according to Sports Business Journal. This year\u2019s Laver Cup, scheduled to be played in San Francisco in September, is expected to exceed $20 million in both sponsorship and ticketing/hospitality revenue.\nFederer may soon have another winner. In 2021, he participated in a $235 million Series D round for NotCo, a Chilean company developing plant-based foods. The fundraise, which featured other celebrity investors such as Formula 1 driver Lewis Hamilton and Roots drummer Questlove, valued the startup at $1.5 billion. A year later, NotCo raised another $70 million as it launched a B2B unit to license its artificial intelligence tools to other food makers.\nBut Federer can afford to be patient with his equity plays as he continues to work with more than a dozen partners from his playing days, including private plane operator NetJets, eyewear brand Oliver Peoples and UBS bank (which acquired his sponsor Credit Suisse in 2023). Among his selling points for advertisers, Federer remains more popular than just about any other tennis player, with 43.5 million followers across Facebook, Instagram and X (formerly Twitter)\u2014second only to Rafael Nadal\u2019s 51.6 million, according to marketing agency Two Circles. Meanwhile, Federer saw an engagement rate of 2.3% on those social media platforms over the past three years, nearly double Djokovic\u2019s 1.2% and more than quadruple Nadal\u2019s 0.5%.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s enduring,\u201d Delpy Neirotti, the George Washington University professor, says of Federer\u2019s value as a pitchman. \u201cI think he will be able to sustain this.\u201d\nWith additional reporting by Brett Knight and Matt Craig."
