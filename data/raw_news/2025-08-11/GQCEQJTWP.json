  "content": "Mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani on Monday blasted the \u201cpetty vindictiveness\u201d of rival Andrew Cuomo\u2019s proposed \u201cZohran\u2019s Law\u201d that would target privileged New Yorkers who live in rent-stabilized homes \u2014 but gave no sign he\u2019ll move out.\n\nMamdani, 33, who lives in a $2,300-a-month rent-stabilized Astoria apartment while pulling $142,000 a year as state assemblyman, condemned Cuomo\u2019s proposal as dangerously detail-free.\n\n\u201cWhat do we know about this policy proposal beyond the fact that it seeks to evict me from my apartment?\u201d the Queens lawmaker said.\n\n\u201cLike so much of Andrew Cuomo\u2019s politics, it is characterized by a petty vindictiveness\u2026 How many New Yorkers would have their lives upended by a former governor who is responding to the fact that he was handily beaten by a tenant of a rent-stabilized apartment?\u201d\n\n\n\nCuomo, the former governor, saw his dreams of a convincing political comeback dashed in the Democratic mayoral contest when the socialist Mamdani utterly trounced him, securing more primary votes than any Big Apple Dem in three decades.\n\nThe defeat didn\u2019t stop Cuomo from launching an independent mayoral run, with an emphasis on aggressively attacking Mamdani and making cringe-inducing posts on social media.\n\nThe ex-gov concocted \u201cZohran\u2019s Law\u201d as Mamdani \u2014 the son of well-known filmmaker and a professor \u2014 faced criticism for not giving up his rent-stabilized apartment in what critics said was a hypocritical stance that clashed with his pro-affordable housing campaign message.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to be providing rent-stabilized apartments to the children of millionaires,\u201d Cuomo said Sunday.\n\n\u201cSomewhere last night in New York City, a single mother and her children slept at a homeless shelter because you, Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, are occupying her rent-controlled apartment,\u201d he twisted the knife in a viral tweet.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am calling on you to move out immediately and give your affordable housing back to an unhoused family who need it.\u201d\n\nRent-stabilized homes account for 1 million units \u2014 or half of all apartments \u2014 in New York City.\n\nRent control, which Cuomo inaccurately said applies to Mamdani\u2019s apartment, is for tenants who\u2019ve lived continuously in their homes since 1971.\n\nCuomo\u2019s actual proposal wouldn\u2019t evict high-income New Yorkers from rent-stabilized apartments but would only apply once a rent-stabilized apartment becomes vacant.\n\nThe incoming renter\u2019s income would be capped so that the annual rent makes up at least 30% of that income, meaning a $2,500-a-year apartment can only have tenants who make less than $100,000.\n\n\u201cAndrew Cuomo\u2014the disgraced former governor who casually handed a billion-dollar tax break to Elon Musk\u2014wants working New Yorkers to prove how much they are struggling before he approves their lease,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile Cuomo cares only for the well-being of his Republican donors, Zohran believes city government\u2019s job is to guarantee a life of dignity, not determine who is worth one.\u201d\n\nMamdani repeated his skepticism over such \u201cmeans testing\u201d as an approach, noting the MTA\u2019s \u201cFair Fares\u201d program only serves about 40% of eligible low-income New Yorkers.\n\nHe said a free bus pilot program that he championed didn\u2019t make more millionaires and billionaires ride the bus, but rather helped increase ridership by New Yorkers who already qualified for Fair Fares.\n\nBeyond that, Mamdani argued that Cuomo\u2019s decisions as governor \u2014 particularly slashing $65 million in rental assistance programs \u2014 helped lead to a surge in Big Apple homelessness.\n\n\u201cWhat Andrew Cuomo is proposing, be it the rent control he cited, the rent stabilization he intends to speak about, is in many ways reflective of the fact that I live rent-free in his head,\u201d Mamdani said, giving no indication he planned to leave his home.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not looking to reflect on the fact that he eliminated more affordable housing than he created. He\u2019s not looking to reckon with his cutting of a voucher program that was then followed by a significant increase in homelessness in New York City. He\u2019s not looking to reckon with any of that.\u201d\n\nMayor Eric Adams, who is also running as an independent, used the spat to attack both of his challengers.\n\n\u201cRent-stabilized, low-income apartments should be just for that low-income people,\u201d the mayor said.\n\n\u201cI keep telling people how we have to fix Cuomo\u2019s mess. He created this in 2019 when he took away the standards of who could stay in these apartments. This is one of his problems. He\u2019s complaining about who is in these apartments being high-income earners, but he created this.\u201d",

Kathy Hochul.\nCuomo has been on the attack against Mamdani since last Friday over the cushy apartment in high-cost Astoria.\n\u201cSomewhere last night in New York City, a single mother and her children slept at a homeless shelter because you, Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani, are occupying her rent-controlled apartment,\u201d Cuomo wrote in a viral tweet that racked up more than 28 million views.\n\u201cI am calling on you to move out immediately and give your affordable housing back to an unhoused family who need it. Leaders must show moral clarity. Time to move out,\u201d Cuomo added.\nMamdani, the Democratic Party nominee, has proposed to freeze the rent of government-regulated apartments if he wins the general election in November.\nFormer Gov. Cuomo lost to Mamdani in a June Democratic primary but is running in November on the \u201cFight and Deliver\u201d independent ballot line.\nIncumbent Mayor Eric Adams also is running as an independent after dropping out of the primary as he faced federal corruption charges, which have since been dropped.\nCurtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels, is the Republican nominee and lawyer Jim Walden will also appear on ballots as an independent.\nThe Mamdani campaign accused Cuomo of desperate mudslinging.\n\u201cOn the day of the National Dominican Day Parade, as Andrew Cuomo\u2019s desperate, nonsensical attacks continue, Zohran is busy deepening his support from New Yorkers ready for a city they can afford,\u201d said Mamdani campaign spokeswoman Dora Pekec.\n\u201cIf Mr. Cuomo really cared for working people in New York City, he\u2019d commit today to reimburse the taxpayers the $60 million we are spending on his personal legal defense \u2014 which could pay for thousands of affordable housing units instead of probing the gynecological records of women he harassed.\u201d\nMamdani landed the rent-regulated apartment on StreetEasy when he was making $47,000, his camp said."

      "text": "Zohran Mamdani secured more NYC Dem primary votes than any Big Apple Dem had in over 30 years while toppling Cuomo\nSocialist Zohran Mamdani kneecapped ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s comeback bid for New York City mayor \u2013 securing more primary votes than any Big Apple Democrat in more than three decades.\nThe Queens assemblyman toppled the political scion 56-44 after just three rounds of ranked-choice voting, according to calculations by the city Board of Elections released Tuesday, a week after the June 24 primary.\nHe snagged 117,000 more votes than Cuomo, for a total of about 545,000 \u2014 the most in a Democratic mayoral primary since 1989, when David Dinkins snagged some 547,000 against incumbent Ed Koch in a non-ranked-choice election.\nMamdani\u2019s primary win was essentially locked up last week after he easily topped Cuomo in the first round of voting by more than 70,000 votes.\nBut he widened his lead in the later rounds of early voting, as more votes were transferred to him from other candidates, garnering another 100,000 while Cuomo only grabbed an additional 54,000, the BOE data show.\nAnd Mamdani\u2019s vote total could still grow, with more ballots to be counted in the coming weeks from other mail-in votes.\nThe primary results are expected to be officially certified on July 15, at which point the full demographic breakdown of voters will be released.\nCuomo \u2014 who had insisted he was waiting to see the full results before deciding whether to campaign in the general election as an independent \u2014 continued to stall even after the numbers were revealed.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be continuing conversations with people from all across the city while determining next steps,\u201d Cuomo\u2019s campaign said in a statement.\nRegardless of whether he mounts an actual campaign, Cuomo will still appear on the crowded November ballot, alongside fellow third-party candidates Mayor Eric Adams and lawyer Jim Walden, plus Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa and Mamdani as the Democratic nominee.\n\u201cLast Tuesday, Democrats spoke in a clear voice, delivering a mandate for an affordable city, a politics of the future, and a leader unafraid to fight back against rising authoritarianism,\u201d Mamdani said in a statement.\n\u201cI am humbled by the support of more than 545,000 New Yorkers who voted for our campaign and am excited to expand this coalition even further as we defeat Eric Adams and win a city government that puts working people first.\u201d\nThe dark-horse left-wing candidate took the New York political establishment and the country by surprise with his stunning win, as the vast majority of polls showed him trailing Cuomo by a large margin until the close to the election.\nMamdani drummed up massive support with his social media-fueled campaign targeting younger and new voters with lofty promises focused on affordability \u2014 including free buses, a rent freeze on stabilized units and government-run grocery stores.\nHe may have also benefited from the ranked-choice voting system by cross-endorsing with other candidates, including City Comptroller Brad Lander and the Rev. Michael Blake, in the final weeks of the primary race, whereas Cuomo stood alone.\nBOE Deputy Executive Director Vincent Ignizio explained other candidates were eliminated swiftly because there was no way they could catch up to the two top-leading pols.\nMamdani\u2019s domination is in stark contrast to Adams\u2019 2021 primary win, in which Hizzoner only edged out Kathryn Garcia by a razor-thin 7,000 votes after eight rounds.\nAbout 1,026,000 New Yorkers cast their ballots in last month\u2019s election, while 942,000 votes were tallied in the 2021 Democratic primary in a city still coming out of the COVID pandemic.\nThe impressive margin of victory revealed led to a quick endorsement from state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D-Westchester) \u2013 one of highest ranking Dems to officially back Mamdani.\nWhile state Attorney General Letitia James has also endorsed Mamdani, Gov. Kathy Hochul has yet to officially back the Democratic socialist.\nMamdani, in a Tuesday social media video before the results came out, said in \u201csome ways\u201d he was surprised by his primary night win.\n\u201cWe always thought our victory would come after multiple rounds of rank-choice voting so when we got more first-round votes than Eric Adams got in seven round in the last election it was astonishing,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut in other ways, this was always the plan.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "Mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani criticized Andrew Cuomo's proposed \"Zohran's Law,\" which aims to restrict rent-stabilized apartments for high-income individuals, labeling it as vindictive and poorly defined. Mamdani, who lives in a rent-stabilized apartment while earning $142,000 as a state assemblyman, defended his position against accusations of hypocrisy, arguing that Cuomo's policies contributed to homelessness in New York City. Cuomo's proposal, which would only apply to vacant rent-stabilized apartments, has sparked a heated exchange between the two candidates as they prepare for the upcoming mayoral election.",
