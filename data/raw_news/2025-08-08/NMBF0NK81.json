  "title": "Newsom welcomes Texas Democrats who fled to foil Trump's redistricting plan",
  "description": "Gov. Gavin Newsom and California legislative and congressional members stood with Texas state lawmakers in their opposition to President Trump's plan to redraw voting maps to hold onto power in the midterm election.",
  "content": "Chairs belonging to Texas Democrats remain empty as House Republicans conduct business on the floor of the Texas Capitol on Aug. 8.\n\nCalifornia became center stage for the national political fight over House seats Friday when Gov. Gavin Newsom welcomed Democratic lawmakers from Texas who fled their home state to foil President Trump\u2019s plans to redraw Congressional districts.\n\nCalifornia lawmakers plan to respond with their own plan to gerrymander districts to favor Democrats and neutralize any Republican seats gained in Texas in 2026, with a proposed map expected to become public next week, Newsom said at a press conference after meeting with the lawmakers.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake, California is moving forward,\u201d the governor said. \u201cWe are talking about emergency measures to respond to what\u2019s happening in Texas, and we will nullify what happens in Texas.\u201d\n\nHe noted that while Democrats still support the state\u2019s independent redistricting commission, they must counter Trump\u2019s plan in GOP-led states to give their party a better chance in next year\u2019s midterm election.\n\n\u201cThey drew first blood,\u201d he later added of Republicans.\n\nAsked about the gathering, a Trump administration spokesperson said Newsom was seeking the limelight to further his political ambitions.\n\n\u201cGavin Newsom is a loser of the highest order and he will never be president, no matter how hard he prostitutes himself to the press,\u201d said the spokesperson, Steven Cheung.\n\nFriday marked the second time in two weeks that Texas Democrats have stood next to Newsom at the California Governor\u2019s Mansion and warned that Republican efforts to draw a new map in their state would dilute the power of Black and brown voters.\n\nThe Democrats hoped that their departure would leave the state Legislature with too few members present to change the map in a special session. They face $500 fines for each day of absence, as well as threats of arrest and removal from office by Gov. Greg Abbott and other Texas GOP officials. Some of the Democratic lawmakers were evacuated from a Chicago hotel where they were staying after a bomb threat on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWe are now facing threats \u2014 the threat that we\u2019re going to lose our jobs, the threat of financial ruin, the threat that we will be hunted down as our colleagues sit on their hands and remain silent, as we all get personal threats to our lives,\u201d said Texas state Rep. Ann Johnson (D-Houston), one of six Texas lawmakers at the press conference, who was among those evacuated from the Chicago hotel. \u201cWe as Democrats are standing up to ensure that the voices of every voter is lifted up in this next election, and that the next election is not stolen from them.\u201d\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco); Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-San Jose), chair of the California Democratic congressional delegation; Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire (D-Healdsburg); Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas (D-Hollister) and other elected officials joined the meeting in a show of unity as California Democrats attempt to convince their own state\u2019s voters to fight back.\n\nPelosi noted that the state\u2019s congressional delegation is united in backing the redistricting proposal to counter Trump.\n\n\u201cThe President has paved over the Rose Garden. He\u2019s paved over freedom of speech. He\u2019s paved over freedom of education, [an] independent judiciary, the rule of law,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cHe\u2019s gone too far. We will not let him pave over free and fair elections in our country, starting with what he\u2019s trying to do in Texas.\u201d\n\nShe fought back against an argument some have made \u2014 that two wrongs don\u2019t make a right.\n\n\u201cThis is self-defense for our democracy,\u201d she said.\n\nThe California plan calls for the state Legislature to approve a constitutional amendment establishing new Congressional voting districts crafted to make GOP members vulnerable.\n\nPassage of the bill would result in a special election on Nov. 4, with California voters deciding if the state should temporarily pause the congressional boundaries created by an independent redistricting commission in 2021 and adopt new maps for the 2026, 2028 and 2030 elections.\n\nIf approved by voters, the measure would include a \u201ctrigger\u201d specifying that it would only take effect if Texas or other Republican-led states follow through with redrawing their maps to boost GOP seats before the midterm election. California would revert to its existing redistricting law after the next census and before the 2032 election.\n\nAt least so far, California voters appear uncertain about whether they want to swap Newsom\u2019s plan for the independent redistricting system they previously adopted at the ballot box.\n\nAn Emerson College poll found support for redrawing California\u2019s congressional map at 33% and opposition at 25%. The survey of 1,000 registered voters, conducted Aug. 4 and 5, found that 42% were undecided.\n\nNewsom has expressed confidence that California voters will back his plan, which he is casting as a rebuttal to Trump\u2019s efforts to \u201crig\u201d the midterm elections.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident we\u2019ll get it when people know what it is and what it\u2019s not, and I think, at the end of the day, they understand what\u2019s at stake,\u201d Newsom said Thursday.\n\nNewsom argues that California\u2019s process is more transparent than Trump\u2019s because voters here will see the map and decide if the state should go forward with it.\n\nTo fulfill Trump\u2019s request for five additional seats, Abbott is attempting to redraw House districts in Texas through a state legislative process that does not require voter approval. It\u2019s unclear what will happen in Austin, with Democrats determined to block the effort and Abbott and other Texas Republicans insisting they will keep pressing it.\n\nThe current special session ends on Aug. 19. But in an interview with NBC News Thursday evening, Abbott vowed \u201cto call special session after special session after special session with the same agenda items on there.\u201d\n\nIn addition to arrest on civil warrants, the Democrats are facing threats of being removed from office. Direct-deposit payments to the legislators have been curtailed, forcing them to pick up their checks in person at the state capitol in Austin or go without the money.\n\nThe redistricting fight has strengthened Newsom\u2019s national platform as a potential 2028 presidential contender and bolstered his reputation as a Democrat willing to take the fight to Trump and his allies.\n\nSince Trump took office in January, Newom had been walking a fine line between calling out the president and playing nice in hopes of being able to work together to rebuild from the California wildfires.\n\nBut the gloves came off after Trump deployed the National Guard during federal immigration raids in Los Angeles in June, prompting the governor and his administration to much more aggressively push back on the president\u2019s conservative agenda.",

      "text": "Large number of voters undecided in governor\u2019s race and about congressional redistricting, new poll finds\n- Share via\n- Former Rep. Katie Porter and conservative commentator Steve Hilton are the only candidates in the 2026 governor\u2019s race to have double-digit support among voters in a new poll.\n- Voters are split about a Democratic proposal to redraw the state\u2019s congressional districts that could appear on the ballot in November.\n- Large numbers of voters are undecided.\nMany voters are undecided in California\u2019s 2026 governor\u2019s race as well as about Democratic efforts to redraw the state\u2019s congressional districts in an effort to counter GOP efforts in other states, according to a new poll released Friday.\nIn the first public poll since former Vice President Kamala Harris opted to not run for governor, former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter had the support of 18% of registered voters in California, while Republican commentator Steve Hilton had the backing of 12%, according to the Emerson College poll. No other candidate in the sprawling field had double-digit support, and 38% of voters said they were undecided.\nThe primary will take place June 2. The candidates have yet to start aggressively advertising or reaching out to voters, so these numbers could fluctuate wildly over the next 10 months.\nThe wide-open race to succeed Gavin Newsom as California governor has already attracted a large and diverse field of candidates.\nWhen asked about a special election that could occur in November, voters were split over a proposed Democratic effort to redraw congressional districts. One-third of voters support the effort, a quarter oppose it and 42% were unsure, according to the poll.\nRedistricting typically occurs after the once-a-decade census, but California is considering a middecade redrawing of congressional boundaries to counter potential moves by Texas and other GOP states to boost the number of Republicans in the House and keep the GOP in control of Congress.\nCalifornia state lawmakers are expected to vote on calling a special election about the matter after they return from summer recess Aug. 18.\nThe poll of 1,000 California voters took place on August 4 and 5, and has 3% margin of error in either direction."

      "text": "2,000 National Guard troops will be sent to L.A. amid clashes over immigration raids\n- Share via\nThe Trump administration said it would send 2,000 National Guard troops into Los Angeles after a second day in which protesters confronted immigration agents during raids of local businesses.\nThe move marks a major escalation in Trump\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration and came amid concerns from some officials in California.\nThe Guard has been deployed to Los Angeles previously, but it has been during widespread civil unrest, including the upheaval associated with the 2020 protests following the murder of George Floyd, as well as the riots that occurred after the Rodney King verdict in 1992.\nLos Angeles has seen several violent clashes during the recent immigration raids, but they have been limited to isolated areas including the Home Depot in Paramount, a location in L.A.\u2019s fashion district and at the Civic Center.\nKABC had video showing Guard members in parts of L.A. County including Paramount on Sunday morning. KTLA reported that the guard was patrolling federal facilities in downtown by early Sunday.\nJessica Levinson, a law professor at Loyola Law School, noted that when the National Guard was sent to L.A. before, it was because California requested it and the response was coordinated.\nCoverage of the protests in downtown Los Angeles over President Trump\u2019s deployment of National Guard troops.\nErwin Chemerinsky, dean of UC Berkeley Law School, said in a text to The Times that Trump has the authority under the Insurrection Act of 1807 to federalize the National Guard units of states to suppress \u201cany insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy\u201d that \u201cso hinders the execution of the laws.\u201d\nBut he called the move very troubling. Such deployment typically happen during \u201cextreme circumstances. ... Here it seems it was an early response. And I fear that is to send a message to protesters of the willingness of the federal government to use federal troops to quell protests.\u201d\nIn the most serious recent incident of protest violence, a crowd gathered Saturday near a Home Depot at 6400 Alondra Blvd. in Paramount for a demonstration that escalated over the course of the day into a fiery and tumultuous clash with federal agents.\nThe protest began without violence as demonstrators chanted \u201cICE go home\u201d and \u201cNo justice, no peace.\u201d Some protesters yelled at deputies, and a series of flash-bang grenades was deployed.\n\u201cWhat are you doing!\u201d one man screamed out.\nTimes reporters witnessed federal agents lobbing multiple rounds of flash-bangs and pepper balls at protesters.\nAfter a time, some protesters responded by throwing rocks and other items at ICE vehicles. One person used their own vehicle to speed toward deputies, spurring the deputies to deploy flash-bang grenades at the car. Many of the protesters did not appear to engage in these tactics.\nAround 4 p.m., the confrontation near a Home Depot at 6400 Alondra Blvd. was declared an unlawful assembly, and officials warned protesters in Spanish and English to quit the scene immediately. During the protest, at least one protester was injured, witnesses reported, and a Border Patrol official said an agent was hurt.\nBy 7 p.m., about 100 protesters had gathered in the area of the 710 Freeway near Atlantic Avenue and Alondra Boulevard, where some were lobbing rocks and bottles at L.A. County sheriff\u2019s deputies. At one point, someone set fire to a car, which became engulfed in flames.\nDeputies responded with pepper spray canisters and ordered them to disperse.\nIn a statement shortly afterward, the Sheriff\u2019s Department said: \u201cWe are planning for long-term civil unrest and collaborating with our law enforcement partners.\u201d\nThe department said around 8 p.m. that it had arrested two people on suspicion of assaulting an officer. One allegedly threw a Molotov cocktail, and three deputies were struck, causing minor injuries, the department said. It did not make any other arrests earlier on Saturday.\nHowever, U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli said in a post on X that federal agents had arrested more than a dozen people \u201cwho impeded agents in their ability to conduct law enforcement operations.\u201d\n\u201cWe will continue to arrest anyone who interferes with federal law enforcement,\u201d Essayli said.\nThe Department of Homeland Security could not immediately be reached for information on the arrests.\nEarlier Saturday, Tom Homan, the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cborder czar,\u201d said officials were cracking down hard on the unrest and that the National Guard would be deployed to the city Saturday night.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom confirmed Saturday that the federal government was moving to take over the California National Guard and deploy 2,000 soldiers.\nNewsom criticized the federal action in a statement Saturday evening, saying that local law enforcement was already mobilized and that sending in troops was a move that was \u201cpurposefully inflammatory\u201d and would \u201conly escalate tensions.\u201d\n\u201c[T]here is currently no unmet need,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cThis is the wrong mission and will erode public trust.\u201d\nAt the Paramount protest, chants of \u201cFuera ICE\u201d \u2014 ICE, get out \u2014 could be heard as flash-bang grenades deployed by federal agents lighted up the scene. The agents appeared to include members of Border Patrol, the U.S. Marshals Service and Homeland Security Investigations.\nA group of protesters on a street corner shouted expletives and that there was \u201cnothing but noise.\u201d Shortly afterward, the grenades exploded at their feet, causing them to briefly scatter.\nA Times reporter watched one protester gather a bag of trash and light it on fire in the middle of Alondra Boulevard, half a block from where immigration agents were gathered.\n\u201cThis is a difficult time for our city. As we recover from an unprecedented natural disaster, many in our community are feeling fear following recent federal immigration enforcement actions across Los Angeles County. Reports of unrest outside the city, including in Paramount, are deeply concerning. We\u2019ve been in direct contact with officials in Washington, D.C., and are working closely with law enforcement to find the best path forward,\u201d L.A. Mayor Karen Bass said after the National Guard deployment was announced.\nSaturday\u2019s scene in Paramount followed raids across Los Angeles on Friday that led to the arrests of 44 people on suspicion of immigration violations, and another on suspicion of obstructing justice.\nIn his Fox News interview, Homan, the president\u2019s former acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement director and now \u201cborder czar,\u201d made unsubstantiated claims about the people who had been arrested, saying they included child sex offenders, gang members and national security threats.\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth said he may deploy active-duty U.S. Marines from Camp Pendleton in Southern California \u201cif violence continues.\u201d\n\u201cUnder President Trump, violence & destruction against federal agents & federal facilities will NOT be tolerated. It\u2019s COMMON SENSE,\u201d Hegseth wrote in a social media post.\nIn Paramount, a city that is 82% Latino, protesters gathered along Alondra Boulevard on Saturday after reports that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were targeting people at a Home Depot where day laborers commonly gather in search of work.\nA group of protesters stationed themselves near the Alondra exit of the 710 Freeway, as a second gathered by the Home Depot.\nLos Angeles County sheriff\u2019s deputies arrived on the scene about 11 a.m. The department clarified in a statement that it \u201cwas not involved in any federal law enforcement operations or actions,\u201d and was present only to assist with traffic and crowd control.\nBy Saturday afternoon, bright orange shopping carts from Home Depot and a blue recycling bin were scattered across the boulevard. The air was acrid with smoke.\nFederal agents deployed round after round of flash-bangs and pepper balls. Some of the projectiles struck protesters, witnesses said.\nOne woman among the protest group appeared to be bleeding, and another man was treated for injuries.\n\u201cThere were some individuals around him throwing bricks. One of the windows got shattered and he was knocked unconscious. He seemed in a pretty bad state,\u201d said Nico Thompson-Lleras, an attorney with the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights who witnessed the incident. He said it was unclear whether the man was hit by a vehicle, a weapon or something else.\nThere is confusion as to what, if any ICE action was planned in the area.\nParamount Mayor Peggy Lemons, who was present at the scene, said the confrontation appeared to have started after protesters spotted immigration officers staging in a nearby business plaza where DHS has an office. Besides the reports of a raid at Home Depot, some immigrant legal advocates said they had been called because a raid was expected at a nearby meatpacking facility, but no raid materialized on Saturday, and a federal official told The Times there was no raid undertaken.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what was happening, or what their target was. To think that there would be no heightening of fear and no consequences from the community doesn\u2019t sound like good preparation to me,\u201d she said. \u201cAbove all, there is no communication and things are done on a whim. And that creates chaos and fear.\u201d\nThe city of Paramount released a statement reaffirming it was not working with ICE or assisting the immigration operations in any way.\nHelicopter footage from the scene showed law enforcement vehicles blocking access as they closed the road. Border Patrol agents stood lined up. Sheriff\u2019s deputies set off flash-bangs to clear a freeway exit of protesters.\nA U.S. Marshals Service bus approaching the location was surrounded by a crowd as it exited the freeway. Protesters kicked the vehicle and pushed back in an attempt to stop it, before another federal vehicle pulled up alongside the bus. An agent appeared to shoot tear gas to push the crowd back.\nLindsay Toczylowski, chief executive of Immigrant Defenders Law Center, said in a post on X that ICE agents threw a tear-gas canister at two female attorneys with the organization, after they approached to ask that they be allowed to see a warrant and observe the action.\nICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the incident.\nProtesters burned an American flag while others waved Mexican flags. Some began lining the boulevard with large cement bricks.\nOne immigration agent was cut on his hand from a rock that sailed through his windshield, according to a social media post by U.S. Border Patrol chief Michael W. Banks.\nFederal officials struck an ominous tone.\n\u201cMultiple arrests have already been made for obstructing our operations,\u201d FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said on X. \u201cMore are coming. We are pouring through the videos for more perpetrators. You bring chaos, and we\u2019ll bring handcuffs.\u201d\nJos\u00e9 Luis Solache Jr., the California Assembly member who represents the Paramount area that includes the Home Depot, said he was on the way to a community event when he saw Border Patrol cars exit the freeway. He decided to turn around.\nSolache said he arrived and began observing alongside other demonstrators in a peaceful effort when the agents started shooting off canisters in their direction, forcing him and others to run through the smoke. After identifying himself to agents, he tried to get information about what they were doing, but they would not answer his questions, he said.\n\u201cYou see the community here, demonstrating that they don\u2019t want them here,\u201d he said as flash-bangs went off nearby. \u201cOur hardworking communities are being targeted. These are hardworking families. These are not criminals. You\u2019re going to facilities where people are literally working.\u201d\nTimes staff writer Connor Sheets contributed to this report."

      "text": "Powerful labor coalition backs redrawing California\u2019s congressional map in fight with Texas and Trump\n- Share via\n- The California Federation of Labor Unions endorsed Democrats\u2019 efforts to call for a special election in November to redraw California\u2019s congressional districts.\n- The influential group said it would spend several million dollars to support the effort, which is in response to Texas potentially redrawing its maps to boost GOP numbers in Congress at President Trump\u2019s behest.\nOne of California\u2019s most influential labor organizations endorsed redrawing the state\u2019s congressional maps to counter President Trump\u2019s effort to push Republican states, notably Texas, to increase his party\u2019s numbers in Congress in next year\u2019s midterm election.\nThe California Federation of Labor Unions voted unanimously Tuesday to support putting a measure on the ballot in November. The proposal, backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom and many of the state\u2019s Democratic leaders, would ask voters to temporarily change congressional district boundaries that were drawn by an independent redistricting commission four years ago, with some conditions.\nRepublicans could potentially lose up to a half dozen seats in California\u2019s 52-member delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives. After it returns for its summer recess on Aug. 18, the California Legislature is expected to vote to place the measure on the statewide ballot in a special election.\n\u201cPresident Trump has said that Republicans are \u2018entitled\u2019 to five more congressional votes in Texas. Well, they aren\u2019t entitled to steal the 2026 election. California\u2019s unions refuse to stand by as democracy is tested,\u201d Lorena Gonzalez, president of the federation, said in a statement. \u201cCalifornia Labor is unified in our resolve to fight back against President Trump\u2019s anti-worker agenda.\u201d\nRedistricting \u2014 the esoteric redrawing of the nation\u2019s 435 congressional districts \u2014 typically occurs once every decade after the U.S. census tallies the population across the nation. Population shifts can result in changes in a state\u2019s allocation of congressional seats, such as when California lost a seat after the 2020 census the first time in the state\u2019s history.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau released apportionment data, but the pandemic-induced lag has already caused ripple effects on redistricting and 2022 races.\nThe political redistricting process had long been crafted by elected officials to give their political parties an edge or to protect incumbents \u2014 sometimes in brazen, bizarrely shaped districts. Californians voted in 2010 to create an independent commission to draw congressional maps based on communities of interest, logical geography and ensuring representation of minority communities.\nThe ballot measure being pushed by Newsom and others would allow state lawmakers to help determine district boundaries for the next three election cycles if Texas approves a pending measure to reconfigure districts to increase Republican-held congressional seats in that state. Line-drawing would return to the independent commission after the 2030 census.\nThe California Federation of Labor is committed to spending several million dollars supporting a mid-decade redistricting ballot measure, on top of what it already planned to spend on competitive congressional races next year, according to a person familiar with the plans who asked for anonymity to speak candidly about the strategy.\nA spokesperson for several organizations devoted to fighting any effort to change the state\u2019s redistricting process said that Charles Munger Jr., the son of a billionaire, and who bankrolled the ballot measure to create the independent commission, is committed to making sure it is not weakened.\n\u201cWhile Charles Munger has been out of politics since 2016, he has said he will vigorously defend the reforms he helped pass, including nonpartisan redistricting,\u201d said Amy Thoma, spokesperson for the Voters First Coalition. \u201cHis previous success in passing ballot measures in California means he knows exactly what is needed to be successful. We will have the resources necessary to make our coalition heard.\u201d"

      "text": "AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 Texas Gov. Greg Abbott vowed to call \u201cspecial session after special session after special session\u201d in response to Democratic lawmakers who have fled the state to block redistricting legislation, saying they\u2019ll have to stay out of Texas for years to prevent it becoming law.\n\u201cWe are in the process as we speak right now of searching for, preparing to arrest Democrats who may be in Texas, may be elsewhere,\u201d Abbott, a Republican, told NBC News in an interview at the governor\u2019s mansion Thursday evening.\n\u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you this also, Democrats act like they\u2019re not going to come back as long as this is an issue,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cThat means they\u2019re not going to come back until like 2027 or 2028, because I\u2019m going to call special session after special session after special session with the same agenda items on there.\u201d\nMore than 50 Democratic lawmakers fled the state earlier this week to block the state House from moving forward with the Republican majority\u2019s proposed congressional map, designed to boost the number of GOP-held seats ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections.\nThe Republican-led state House has approved civil arrest warrants for the missing lawmakers, and Abbott has filed a lawsuit with the state Supreme Court seeking to remove the House Democratic leader from office for \u201can intentional abandonment of his constitutional duty.\u201d\nAbbott said he has not spoken to President Donald Trump about the federal government\u2019s potential role in ending the standoff. Trump said earlier this week that the FBI \u201cmay have to\u201d get involved, though an administration official also told NBC News earlier this week that there were no plans to use federal agents to arrest Texas lawmakers who left the state.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to disclose though all may or may not be involved,\u201d Abbott said Thursday when asked if the FBI has a legitimate role to play. \u201cAll I can say is we\u2019re going to use every tool that we can to make sure that these runaway Democrats are going to be held accountable.\u201d\nAbbott said a redraw of the state\u2019s congressional map was necessary because \u201cboth the law and facts have changed since we drew the lines back in 2021,\u201d pointing to a federal appeals court last year that ruled that multiple minority groups could not form a coalition to challenge a political map as a racial gerrymander.\nBut Abbott also pointed to the results of the last election as political justification for mid-decade redistricting, instead of waiting until the next national census after 2030.\n\u201cA lot of people who voted Republican, who voted for Donald Trump, were trapped into Democrat districts,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cAnd so when you look at the facts, when you look at the law, there is every reason to go ahead and draw the lines so that we can assure that every voter is going to have the opportunity to vote for their candidate of choice.\u201d\nTrump won 56% of the vote in Texas in 2024. The proposed congressional map could lead to Republicans controlling 30 of the state\u2019s congressional districts \u2014 nearly 80%. Republicans currently control 25 of the state\u2019s 38 congressional districts.\nAbbott rejected the notion that the new map could give Republicans outsized representation, pointing to Illinois, with its 14-3 Democratic congressional delegation, and other states.\n\u201cWhat has surfaced because of Texas doing redistricting is the way that all the blue states in the country have gerrymandered their states. Look at the disproportionate lack of Republican representation in Congress, in California, Illinois, Massachusetts \u2014 which has zero members of Congress who are Republican, New York,\u201d Abbott said.\nSome of those blue-state governors have vowed to retaliate and push their own states to draw new congressional boundaries if Texas does so, although they could face significant hurdles due to the different redistricting processes in their states.\n\u201cThe governor doesn\u2019t have unilateral authority in those states to take action,\u201d Abbott said of that possible retaliation. \u201cThey have committees and commissions and things like that. But the fact is: Look at the map of Illinois. It\u2019s drawn in such a way that they can\u2019t even squeeze out another Republican. It\u2019s a joke.\u201d\nThe ongoing standoff has ground to a halt the special legislative session Abbott called in Texas, also blocking action on other priorities including relief for victims of devastating floods in central Texas last month. Republican state House leaders chose to move forward on the redistricting legislation first, but all bills in the legislature are now on pause without a quorum present.\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing that\u2019s denying our ability to get legislation passed. And it\u2019s these Democrats who have fled the state, turned their backs on their fellow constituents,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cAnd those Democrats are going to lose their job in the upcoming election, if they don\u2019t get kicked out before then, because they\u2019re not stepping up helping out their constituents who are in desperate need.\u201d\n\u201cAny aid to their constituents who\u2019ve been harmed by these floods is being delayed and denied by the derelict Democrats,\u201d Abbott said.\nAll of that fed into Abbott\u2019s argument to the state Supreme Court that state Rep. Gene Wu, the House Democratic Caucus chairman, has violated his oath of office and abandoned his seat by fleeing to Illinois.\n\u201cIf quorum breaking is allowed to succeed, then one-third of House Democrats will be able to dictate what the rule of law is for 100% of all Texans,\u201d Abbott said of his lawsuit, adding that he believed the state Supreme Court would agree that Democrats do not have that power.\n\u201cThese Democrats, they\u2019re the antithesis of what a Texan is,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cOh, the going got tough. Let\u2019s not fight, let\u2019s flee. These are quitters. They are cowards, and their cowardice will cause them to get kicked out of office.\u201d\nWu, in a statement Tuesday, responded to Abbott\u2019s lawsuit by saying his \u201cconstitutional duty is to not be a willing participant\u201d in the special session that includes the congressional map redraw.\n\u201cDenying the governor a quorum was not an abandonment of my office; it was a fulfillment of my oath,\u201d Wu said in the statement. \u201cUnable to defend his corrupt agenda on its merits, Greg Abbott now desperately seeks to silence my dissent by removing a duly-elected official from office.\u201d\nRyan Chandler reported from Austin and Bridget Bowman reported from Washington, D.C."

      "text": "Texas redistricting move would \u2018trigger\u2019 new California maps, Newsom says\n- Share via\n- The outcome of the dueling state efforts could decide which party controls the House of Representatives after the 2026 midterm elections.\n- Nothing official can be done until state lawmakers return from recess to Sacramento on Aug. 18.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 A last-ditch effort by California Democrats to redraw the state\u2019s congressional map for the 2026 election, countering a similar push by Texas Republicans, is now up against the clock.\nGov. Gavin Newsom said Monday that Democrats are moving forward with a plan to put a rare mid-decade redistricting plan before voters on Nov. 4. But state lawmakers will craft a \u201ctrigger,\u201d he said, meaning California voters would only vote on the measure if Texas moved forward with its own plans to redraw Congressional boundaries to add five more Republican seats.\n\u201cIt\u2019s cause and effect, triggered on the basis of what occurs or doesn\u2019t occur in Texas,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cI hope they do the right thing, and if they do, then there\u2019ll be no cause for us to have to move forward.\u201d\nDemocratic lawmakers in Texas on Monday left the state to deprive Republicans of the quorum needed to pass the new maps. Republican lawmakers voted 85 to 6 to send state troopers to arrest them and bring them back to the Capitol, a move that is largely symbolic, since the lawmakers won\u2019t face criminal or civil charges.\nThe outcome of the dueling efforts between Texas and California could determine which party controls the House of Representatives after the 2026 midterm elections, which Democrats see as the last bulwark to President Trump\u2019s actions in his second term. Trump has pushed Republicans to add more GOP seats in Texas, hoping to stave off a midterm defeat.\nDemocrats hold 43 of California\u2019s 52 congressional seats. Early discussions among California politicians and strategists suggest that redrawn lines could shore up some vulnerable incumbent Democrats by making their purple districts more blue, while forcing five or six of the state\u2019s nine Republican members into tougher reelection fights.\nBut nothing official can be done until state lawmakers return from recess to Sacramento on Aug. 18.\nDemocrats, who hold a supermajority in the Legislature, would have less than a month to draw a new map, hold hearings and negotiate the language of a bill calling for the special November election, leaving just enough time for voter guides to be mailed and ballots to be printed.\nThe revolt by the state House Democrats, many of whom went to Illinois or New York on Sunday, and Abbott giving them less than 24 hours to come home ratcheted up a widening fight over congressional maps.\nDemocratic lawmakers and operatives said Monday that the timeline is doable, but they would have to act quickly.\nCalifornia\u2019s Democratic congressional delegation expressed consensus during a video meeting Monday with moving forward with a ballot measure that would allow mid-decade redistricting only if another state moves forward with it, according to a person familiar with the virtual meeting, and that the change would be temporary. They expressed their support for the independent commission.\nCalifornia Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas said the Democratic caucus met Sunday night \u201cto discuss the urgent threat of a continued, blatant Trumpian power grab \u2014 a coordinated effort to undermine our democracy and silence Californians.\u201d\nDemocrats in the California Senate and Assembly held separate meetings to discuss redistricting. David Binder, a pollster who works with Newsom, presented internal polling that showed tepid early support among voters for temporarily changing state laws to allow the Legislature to draw new maps for elections in 2026, 2028 and 2030.\n\u201cOur voters must be empowered to push back,\u201d Rivas said. \u201cCalifornia has never backed down \u2014 and we won\u2019t start now.\u201d\nTexas Democrats resist\nDemocratic lawmakers\u2019 exodus from Austin on Monday denied Republicans the quorum necessary to proceed with a vote on a redrawn state map that could net Republicans five congressional seats.\nDemocratic lawmakers balked at threats from Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. The Texas House Democratic Caucus put out a statement riffing on a slogan made famous during the Texas Revolution: \u201cCome and take it.\u201d One member of the caucus noted that being absent was not a crime and that Texas warrants can\u2019t be served in Illinois or New York, where many lawmakers have gone.\n\u201cThere is no felony in the Texas penal code for what he says,\u201d said Rep. Jolanda Jones, a Democrat. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to get soundbites, and he has no legal mechanism.\u201d\nThe Texas House Republican speaker, Dustin Burrows, said that Democrats leaving does not \u201cstop this House from doing its work. It only delays it.\u201d\nBut Abbott\u2019s legal options to get his redistricting bill passed, by expelling Democrats or compelling their return, appear narrow, likely forcing the governor\u2019s office to make challenges in courtrooms based in Democratic districts. Abbott has until the end of the year to secure new maps for them to be used in the state\u2019s March 3 primaries.\nAt a news conference last week in Sacramento, Newsom compared Trump\u2019s pressure on Abbott to add five Republican congressional seats as akin to his efforts to \u201cfind\u201d 12,000 votes to win Georgia after the 2020 election.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here to eliminate the commission,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re here to provide a pathway in \u201926, \u201928 and in 2030 for congressional maps on the basis of a response to the rigging of the system by the president of the United States. It won\u2019t just happen in Texas. I imagine he\u2019s making similar calls all across this country. It\u2019s a big deal. I don\u2019t think it gets much bigger.\u201d\nEscalation on a deadline\nFor decades, redrawing California\u2019s electoral maps amounted to political warfare. In 1971, then-Gov. Ronald Reagan vetoed a redistricting plan that he called \u201ca mockery of good government.\u201d The California Supreme Court ultimately drew the lines, and did so again in 1991, when then-Gov. Pete Wilson rejected maps drawn by Democrats.\nCalifornia\u2019s state lawmakers last drew their own district lines in 2001, after members of both parties signed off on a plan drawn up to protect incumbents.\nIn 2008, California voters stripped state lawmakers of the power to draw their own districts by passing Proposition 11, which created an independent redistricting commission. Two years later, voters handed the power to redraw congressional district maps to the same panel by passing Proposition 20. That group drew the lines before the 2012 elections, and again after the 2020 census.\nCalifornia set the date for its last statewide special election \u2014 the 2021 attempted recall of Newsom \u2014 75 days in advance. County election officials would need at least that much time to find voting locations and prepare ballots for overseas and military voters, which must be mailed 45 days before election day, one elections official said.\n\u201cWe need at least a similar timeline and calendar to what took place in 2021 for the gubernatorial recall election,\u201d said Dean Logan, the top elections official in Los Angeles County.\nCalifornia\u2019s governor wants to redraw congressional lines to offset a Texas gerrymander. Is that snubbing voters who took the power from politicians? Or necessarily fighting fire with fire?\nSimilarly, he said, counties will \u201cneed the funding provided upfront by the state to conduct this election, and the funding to do the redistricting associated with it, because counties are not prepared financially.\u201d\nThe 2021 recall election cost California taxpayers about $200 million. The preliminary estimate for Los Angeles County to administer the redistricting election is about $60 million.\nNational fight over state lines\nRepublican strategist Jon Fleischman, former executive director of the California Republican Party, said Republicans nationally need to take state Democrats\u2019 efforts to redraw the maps seriously \u2014 by pulling out their checkbooks.\n\u201cOur statewide Republican fundraising has atrophied because it has been over a generation since we had a viable statewide candidate in California,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kind of money that it would take to battle this \u2014 it would have to be national funding effort.\u201d\nWhile Texas prompted California Democrats to take action, Fleischman said, the issue has enough momentum here that it ultimately doesn\u2019t matter what Texas does.\n\u201cIf Gavin Newsom places this on the ballot, it means he\u2019s already done his polling and has figured out that it will pass because he cares more running for president that redistricting in California,\u201d Fleischman said. \u201cAnd he knows he can\u2019t afford to make this play and lose.\u201d\nFormer Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican who championed the ballot measure that created the independent redistricting commission, has not weighed in on the mid-decade redistricting efforts in Texas and California. But a spokesperson for the former governor made clear that he vehemently opposes both.\nSince leaving office, Schwarzenegger has fought for independent map-drawing across the nation. Redistricting is among the political reforms that are the focus of the Schwarzenegger Institute at USC.\n\u201cHis take on all of this is everyone learned in preschool or kindergarten that two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. He thinks gerrymandering is evil,\u201d said Daniel Ketchell, a spokesperson for Schwarzenegger. \u201cIt takes power from the people and gives it to politicians. He thinks it\u2019s evil, no matter where they do it.\u201d\nWilner reported from Washington, Nelson and Mehta from Los Angeles and Luna from Sacramento."

Gavin Newsom is adopting a much more aggressive social media strategy.\n- The governor defended the more combative posture, saying he\u2019s speaking the only language Trump and his supporters understand.\n- The approach is winning the attention of social media users and support from some Democrats, but he also runs the risk of offending people who miss respectable political discourse.\nSACRAMENTO \u2014 In a common insult the Trump administration uses against dissidents of federal policy, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller called a California judge a \u201ccommunist\u201d after she blocked roving immigration arrests based on race alone.\nThe MAGA-embraced epithet from Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s official press office in response, however, was hardly typical for a Democratic politician.\n\u201cThis fascist cuck in DC continues his assault on democracy and the Constitution, and his attempt to replace the sovereignty of the people with autocracy,\u201d the California governor\u2019s office posted on social media. \u201cSorry the Constitution hurt your feelings, Stephen. Cry harder.\u201d\nPopular among the far right and the gutters of social media, the term is used to insult liberals as weak and is also short for \u201ccuckold,\u201d which refers to the husband of an unfaithful wife.\nThe low blow sanctioned by a potential 2028 presidential candidate set a new paradigm for the political left that has long embraced Michelle Obama\u2019s \u201cwhen they go low, we go high\u201d motto to rise above the callousness of Trump and his acolytes.\nIt\u2019s also an example of Newsom\u2019s more aggressive social media strategy.\nThis week the governor posted memes of Trump with child molester and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.\nShortly after the Department of Homeland Security detained and handcuffed U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla at a news conference in June, state Assemblymember Joe Patterson (R-Rockland) alleged on X that he would be treated the same way if he interrupted an event held by the governor.\n\u201cI\u2019d politely ask you to leave,\u201d retorted Newsom\u2019s communications director, Izzy Gardon. \u201cThough you do not deserve politeness in this moment for this grotesque tweet, you bald little man.\u201d (Patterson later added \u201cBald little man\u201d to his profile on the social media site.)\nThe governor and his taxpayer-supported press office joked that HBO had cast Miller as Lord Voldemort \u2014 the pasty, hairless super villain in the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d stories \u2014 and mocked the scandal-plagued Texas attorney general after he accused Newsom of fomenting lawlessness.\nThe governor defended the more combative posture at a recent news conference. He noted that Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, had used the word last month when he called Newsom \u201cthe biggest cuck in politics.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they understand any other kind of language, so I have no apologies for standing tall and firm and pushing back against their cruelty,\u201d Newsom said.\nNewsom\u2019s advisors say the governor reached a turning point after the president sent California National Guard troops into Los Angeles to protect federal agents from clashes with protesters during immigration sweeps. Since Trump took office in January, the Democratic leader had been walking a fine line between calling out the president and playing nice in hopes of being able to work together after the California wildfires.\nThe governor said publicly said that the decision to militarize Los Angeles showed him that you can\u2019t work with the president, only for him. With federal troops on the ground, his aides said, Newsom also wanted to stand up for California, concerned about what would happen if he didn\u2019t.\nThe directive was to match the tactics emanating from the White House and meet Trump and his allies where they are. Forget the high road.\nOver the last month, they\u2019ve taken on more fights with Newsom\u2019s critics, reacted more quickly to shoot down misinformation about the governor or California, challenged narratives they find to be untrue, or unfair, and taken many of their own shots.\n\u201cSometimes the best way to challenge a bully is to punch them in the metaphorical face,\u201d said Bob Salladay, Newsom\u2019s top communications advisor. \u201cThese tactics may seem extreme to some and they are, but there\u2019s a significant difference here: We\u2019re targeting powerful forces that are ripping apart this country, using their own words and tactics. Trump and Stephen Miller are attacking the powerless like every fascist bully before them.\u201d\nNewsom also accused the president of trying to preserve Republican power in Washington by pressuring Texas to redraw congressional districts to elect GOP representatives.\nNewsom\u2019s aides say the strategy is working.\nThe governor\u2019s personal social media accounts gained 2.3 million new followers, including over 1 million each on TikTok and Instagram, and more than 883 million views from June 6 to July 6, according to his tallies.\nPodcasters and social media influencers, such as Fred Wellman and Brian Tyler Cohen, boosted the interest with their own posts about the governor. On TikTok in particular, there\u2019s a growing ecosystem of people who make videos about his videos.\nNewsom\u2019s official state accounts also experienced an exponential rise in followers and engagement in June.\nThe attention bodes well for a politician considering a bid for president. His aides argue that the strategy benefits California by shutting down misinformation and helping people understand what\u2019s really going on.\n\u201cThe thing that he does so well these days is that he responds rapidly, and he responds rapidly in a way that\u2019s very snackable to the average consumer of news,\u201d said Karen North, a professor of digital social media at the USC Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism.\nNorth pointed to the adage that \u201cit takes a minute to say a sound bite, but an hour to explain why it is false.\u201d\nRepublicans have been considered masters of sound bites for decades, and Democrats are often criticized for trying to explain the details of policies when people just want to hear the bottom line.\nNewsom is breaking that mold, she said.\n\u201cHe has emerged as the person willing and able to take on the president, but in some ways, they use the same playbook of quick, engaging responses that are easy for people to understand without any analysis,\u201d North said. \u201cNewsom has the advantage of playing defense as an offense. So when the president says something that is problematic to California or problematic to everyday citizens, Gavin Newsom is laser-focused and ready to strike back without any hesitation, and in a way that\u2019s very simple and very engaging.\u201d\nSix months after L.A. fires, Newsom calls for federal aid while criticizing the Trump administration\nGov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s comments left him once again in the conflicting position of criticizing Republicans while asking them for disaster aid after the L.A. fires\nIn some ways, the governor learned the hard way after Trump used his platforms to label Newsom as \u201cincompetent\u201d and blame him for the Los Angeles wildfires in January. The president made a barrage of claims at news conferences and on the social media site Truth Social about dry reservoirs, the need to transfer more water from Northern to Southern California, a lack of forest management and empty fire hydrants that went viral, leaving Newsom on the back foot defending himself.\nWhen Trump sent the National Guard into Los Angeles, the governor almost immediately went on the attack to counter the president\u2019s claims that he deployed troops to control lawlessness that Newsom had allowed. The governor\u2019s office said his June 10 speech, which framed Trump as unnecessarily invading an American city for his own political gain, received 41 million views.\nAlthough Newsom\u2019s aggression has received praise from some Democrats, it\u2019s also a \u201ca massive pivot from being a Bannon bro,\u201d said Eric Jaye, a former senior advisor to Newsom turned critic who opposed his 2018 gubernatorial bid.\nJaye is referring to the \u201cThis is Gavin Newsom\u201d podcast, where the governor flummoxed Democrats who thought he appeared too chummy with Trump campaign architect Steve Bannon, conservative personality Charlie Kirk and others close to the president.\nNewsom billed the show as an opportunity to speak to people with other viewpoints and he delivered on that premise. The governor also received criticism from within his own party for not forcefully challenging the perspectives that directly contradicted Democratic values, such as opposition to abortion rights, and agreeing with Kirk that it\u2019s unfair for transgender athletes to compete in women\u2019s sports.\nJaye credited Newsom with \u201ca very quick turnaround,\u201d which \u201csaved himself.\u201d\nIn the long shadow of his policies, renewed attention is being paid to Miller\u2019s upbringing in the famously liberal enclave once dubbed \u201cthe People\u2019s Republic of Santa Monica.\u201d\nBut now, with his amped-up social media presence, Newsom runs the risk of offending voters who miss respectful political discourse.\nTrump\u2019s derogatory nicknames for his opponents, such as calling Newsom \u201cNewscum\u201d or Elizabeth Warren \u201cPocahontas,\u201d have not appeared to cause the president much political harm. He embraced \u201clock her up\u201d chants about Hillary Clinton in 2016 and constantly mocked Joe Biden before the former president dropped out of the 2024 presidential contest. Trump still won both races.\nNorth said Trump also has the benefit of saying things that appear \u201cpassionate and reckless,\u201d but people don\u2019t believe he\u2019s going to follow through.\nAs a potential presidential contender, the question is whether Newsom can use words such as \u201ccuck\u201d and say he wants to change laws to redistrict California to benefit Democrats in the midterm elections without worrying people and seeming too Trump-like to be palatable to voters who detest the president\u2019s antics.\n\u201cIt has to be disturbing to a lot of people if the new era of politics involves hostile personal attacks,\u201d North said.\nTimes staff writer Seema Mehta contributed to this report."

      "text": "Newsom meets with Trump to move past the \u2018noise\u2019 of the election\n- Share via\n- Gov. Gavin Newsom traveled to Washington to secure federal disaster aid in response to the Los Angeles County wildfires and build his relationship with President Trump.\n- Newsom said he sought to \u201cturn a page\u201d and move past the \u201crhetoric and noise\u201d of the election cycle with Trump and other Republican leaders during the trip.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s official reason for visiting Washington this week was to shore up federal disaster aid in response to the Los Angeles County wildfires.\nBut the Democratic governor of California also had another objective: To continue to repair his rocky relationship with the commander-in-chief.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a familiarity, and there was a relationship that was born of a crisis around COVID,\u201d Newsom said in an interview Thursday, adding that President Trump came through for California during the pandemic. \u201cI wanted to go back to that space.\u201d\nThe governor described his 90-minute sit-down with the president in the Oval Office Wednesday as \u201ca real and substantive\u201d and \u201cpositive\u201d conversation that included wildfire recovery and more thorny topics, such as water policy and the bills on Newsom\u2019s desk to increase legal funding to challenge the president\u2019s actions in court.\nNewsom\u2019s expedition into the Republican White House shows the evolution of his approach to Trump: from a Democratic fighter and outspoken critic during a bruising election cycle to a statesman eager to move past the \u201cnoise\u201d and forge a path to work together to benefit Californians.\n\u201cIn a time of need and crisis, people need to see their representatives working together,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cI have no patience for people not working together in a crisis.\u201d\nAs a top Democrat in a nation that elected Trump in November, crossing party lines and rebuilding a bond with the same guy who nicknamed him \u201cNewscum\u201d and previously blamed him for the wildfires could also help his political career if the governor has presidential ambitions of his own. The visit Wednesday appeared to be the president\u2019s first meeting with any Democratic governor in his second term.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t Newsom\u2019s first rodeo and he recognizes this isn\u2019t going to be his last disaster,\u201d said Jack Pitney, a professor of politics at Claremont McKenna College. \u201cIf he\u2019s going to be an effective governor, he has to keep lines of communication to the White House open. If he doesn\u2019t, he won\u2019t be an effective governor, and that will make it hard for him to advance politically.\u201d\nThe relationship between Newsom and Trump appeared to improve in real time two weeks ago when the president visited Los Angeles to survey wildfire damage.\nPresident Trump called California\u2019s high-speed rail plan the \u2018the worst-managed project\u2019 he has seen.\nNewsom tapped his shoes as he patiently waited on the tarmac at Los Angeles International Airport to greet and embrace the president. Minutes after Newsom praised Trump, the president pledged to support the wildfire recovery without any mention of conditions he threatened to demand in exchange for aid earlier in the day.\n\u201cWhen we got off the tarmac, I felt like we were in the middle of a conversation we had 4\u00bd years ago,\u201d Newsom said about the quick shift back to congeniality during their first in-person talk since Trump returned to office.\nAfter the brief airport chat and a 30-minute phone call the next day, Trump\u2019s daily barrage of criticism of the governor has mostly stopped. Newsom has been careful not to immediately react to everything Trump says or does, but also walk the fine line of speaking out when he feels California\u2019s values are under attack.\n\u201cThis is a next-level and complicated charm offensive,\u201d said Robin Swanson, a Democratic consultant.\nNewsom isn\u2019t alone. Other governors around the country are also trying to figure out how to thread the needle with the president, said Gar Culbert, a political science professor at Cal State Los Angeles.\n\u201cThe Trump administration is trying to demonstrate the strength of the federal government at the expense of the states and Newsom wants the state to be independent and exercise some amount of sovereignty, but it is also reliant on federal funding for a whole lot slew of projects and programs,\u201d Culbert said.\nNewsom is attempting to resume the same delicate balance he struck at the beginning of his first term.\nWhile lieutenant governor in 2019, he walked through the charred remains of Paradise with then-President Trump and then-Gov. Jerry Brown after the deadliest wildfire in state history. The COVID-19 pandemic hit the next year, forcing Newsom, as governor, to rely on Trump to tap into the nation\u2019s supply of protective equipment and to seek other federal support.\nWhite House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a briefing Wednesday afternoon that Trump \u201cenjoyed\u201d his trip to survey the remains of the Pacific Palisades fire.\n\u201cHe felt very inspired by the frustration of the residents there, and he has been wholeheartedly committed to ensuring that the water is flowing in California to prevent these wildfires, and also that people have access to their properties,\u201d Leavitt said, adding that the president \u201chas continued to apply tremendous pressure\u201d on Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass to allow people to return to their private properties.\nPacific Palisades reopened for residents last week, though a curfew is still in place, and cleanup of the debris is underway.\n\u201cThe president is willing to work with anybody from blue states or red states to do what\u2019s best for the American people,\u201d Leavitt said.\nBrian Ferguson, a spokesperson for Newsom, said federal aid for the wildfires is largely supporting individuals who were affected.\nIn President Trump\u2019s first visit to California since taking office, he appeared willing to overcome political tensions with Gov. Gavin Newsom and Democrats to support the rebuilding effort after the L.A. wildfires.\nCities, counties and states apply for federal reimbursement for expenses, such as providing shelter, firefighting resources and debris removal, on an ongoing basis. Then-President Biden pledged to reimburse 100% of fire response costs for the first six months, but additional support will be needed from the Trump administration as the communities begin to rebuild.\n\u201cOngoing partnership and support from the federal government will be critical, not just to the state, but for local governments as the building and recovery enters its next phase,\u201d Ferguson said.\nNewsom said federal conditions for wildfire aid did not come up in \u201cexplicit terms\u201d in the conversation Wednesday, nor did details about how long Trump would adhere to Biden\u2019s commitment to reimburse costs. Before Trump landed in Los Angeles last month, he told reporters in North Carolina that aid to California would be contingent on the state\u2019s adoption of voter identification laws, among other demands.\nThe governor said he commended the Environmental Protection Agency for its work during the first phase of hazardous removal of wildfire debris.\nOn a more controversial subject, Newsom also said he told Trump that he will sign a pair of bills California lawmakers sent to his desk in a special session to provide $50 million to fund court challenges in response to the Trump administration and to support legal services for immigrants.\n\u201cI said I never used the phrase \u2018Trump-proofing,\u2019\u201d Newsom said. \u201cAnd I said, and I\u2019m doing it because we\u2019ve already had to litigate against actions you\u2019ve taken and actions you took in the past are likely to happen again. We just have different points of view on these things.\u201d\nWhen asked how Trump responded, Newsom chuckled as he answered.\n\u201cAs you would expect,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cI won\u2019t get into it. But it\u2019s why it was an extended period of conversation.\u201d\nNewsom said the president also \u201creminded me of things we said on the campaign trail.\u201d\nCalifornia Republican Party Chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson called out the governor for pushing the special session bills, \u201cwhile simultaneously running to President Trump for help.\u201d\n\u201cThe hypocrisy is astounding,\u201d Millan Patterson said in statement. \u201cInstead of playing political games and positioning himself for 2028, Newsom should focus on fixing the real problems Californians face \u2014 rampant homelessness, failing schools and an affordability crisis that are forcing families and businesses to flee.\u201d\nState Sen. Henry Stern (D-Calabasas), whose district was affected by the wildfires, said Democrats are prepared to fight Trump when necessary, but disasters demand that they work together.\n\u201cThe governor\u2019s doing the right thing and he\u2019s got the right humility in his tone,\u201d Stern said. \u201cThere\u2019s something about that that cuts through.\u201d\nLuna reported from Sacramento, Pinho from Washington."

      "text": "- Share via\nPresident Trump wants new congressional maps in Texas \u2014 now. Not in the next decade. Not after the next census. Not when it\u2019s traditionally done. He wants it done smack dab in the middle of the decade.\nWhy the odd timing? Because he wants it done in time to help his presidency.\nIn Trump\u2019s mind, Texas is a vending machine: insert redistricting, receive five shiny new Republican seats. \u201cWe are entitled to five more seats,\u201d he declared on CNBC, his voice dripping with the royal \u201cwe\u201d of someone who thinks democracy is nothing but a loyalty program.\nThis is merely the latest example of Trump\u2019s fondness for procedural hardball. He recently sacked the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner for reporting job numbers he didn\u2019t like. And his congressional minions just passed a bipartisan bill that required Democratic votes to get through, only to use budget \u201crescissions\u201d to take back the Democratic priorities they never intended to fund.\nTrump plays Calvinball with democracy \u2014 rules change mid-play, and he\u2019s somehow always the one scoring.\nAnd here\u2019s the thing: It\u2019s not illegal. \u201cNot illegal\u201d in the same way that drinking milk straight from the carton isn\u2019t illegal \u2014 just gross, petty and an announcement to the room that you\u2019re not interested in living by any mutually agreed-upon standards. (Trust me. I have teenagers.)\nThe Texas gambit, though, is utterly Trumpian in its ambitious recklessness. It might work. Or it might backfire and actually cost Republicans 2026 midterm seats. But either way, this aggression is radioactive.\nConsider the immediate reaction. Texas Democrats, lacking the votes to block the move, fled the state entirely \u2014 denying Republicans the quorum they needed to conduct business.\nThis, in turn, was met with all the subtlety of a bounty hunt. The Texas House speaker signed civil arrest warrants for the missing lawmakers. The governor ordered state officials to search every warehouse, farmhouse, henhouse, outhouse and doghouse. (Just kidding. That was Tommy Lee Jones in \u201cThe Fugitive.\u201d But, honestly, it\u2019s a pretty close approximation.)\nPowder keg vibes abound. What happens if and when a Texas lawman tries to slap cuffs on a Democrat in New York or California? Do we get a full-blown interstate standoff? A live cable news shootout of sheriffs and state troopers at the airport terminal gate?\nEven if nothing that crazy happens, legislators making $600 a month are being fined $500 a day for their absence. And the governor has even threatened bribery charges against anyone helping them pay the fines.\nBut here\u2019s where the escalation really kicks in. Even if the Texas Democrats fold and slink back to Austin (honestly, they don\u2019t have much leverage), blue states are already eyeing retaliation.\nCalifornia, New York, Illinois \u2014 they could all dust off the gerrymander machine to carve out extra Democratic seats. (Yes, some blue states handed map drawing to independent commissions, but power has a way of finding the crowbar it needs.)\nThis is mutually assured destruction with ballots instead of missiles.\nAnd the kicker? After both sides squeeze every last seat out of their respective states, this whole exhausting mess could net Republicans one or two extra seats \u2014 or maybe none at all.\nAt this point, you might be wondering \u201cHow did we get here?\u201d\nI\u2019m reminded of an old story \u2014 possibly true, probably apocryphal \u2014 about how circus elephants are trained.\nWhen they\u2019re babies (calves), elephants are chained to a stake they can\u2019t pull up. They try and fail, and eventually they stop trying.\nAs adults, weighing several tons, they could walk away from the stake they are chained to at any time. But they don\u2019t. They\u2019ve learned the stake is \u201cunbreakable.\u201d Resistance is futile.\nTrump is the elephant who never got that memo. To him, the stake \u2014 the norms, the Constitution, the institutions \u2014 is a suggestion, not a restraint.\nThe bigger problem? Everyone else has now seen Trump become unmoored from accountability \u2014 with impunity. They imagine they can do it, too.\nRepublicans who used to quietly admire their own prudent \u201crestraint\u201d now believe they just lacked imagination. And Democrats are starting to believe that playing nice equates to playing dead.\nAnd so, the stakes are coming out of the ground everywhere.\nWe used to imagine there was an invisible line \u2014 one that politicians wouldn\u2019t cross out of shame, duty or fear of the abyss.\nTurns out, the abyss has a DJ and an open bar. The people hurtling toward it aren\u2019t falling. They\u2019re soaring.\nMatt K.

The Los Angeles Times editorial staff does not create or edit the content.\nIdeas expressed in the piece\nTrump\u2019s push for mid-decade congressional redistricting in Texas represents a dangerous departure from democratic norms, with the president treating the state like \u201ca vending machine\u201d where he can \u201cinsert redistricting, receive five shiny new Republican seats.\u201d This represents Trump\u2019s broader pattern of \u201cprocedural hardball\u201d that includes firing officials for unfavorable data and using budget rescissions to renege on bipartisan agreements.\nWhile technically legal, this redistricting effort exemplifies behavior that is \u201cgross, petty and an announcement to the room that you\u2019re not interested in living by any mutually agreed-upon standards.\u201d The timing reveals purely political motivations rather than adherence to traditional redistricting cycles that follow census data.\nThe Texas gambit demonstrates \u201cambitious recklessness\u201d that risks triggering a cycle of retaliation from blue states, potentially leading to \u201cmutually assured destruction with ballots instead of missiles.\u201d This escalation could ultimately result in minimal net gains while significantly damaging democratic institutions and processes.\nThe aggressive enforcement tactics, including civil arrest warrants and threats of bribery charges, create \u201cpowder keg vibes\u201d that could escalate into interstate conflicts and further erode political norms. The episode represents a broader pattern where politicians are abandoning traditional restraints, with \u201cstakes coming out of the ground everywhere.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s approach reflects someone who views constitutional norms and institutions as mere suggestions rather than constraints, teaching others that abandoning traditional boundaries can be done \u201cwith impunity.\u201d This creates a dangerous precedent where both parties increasingly believe that \u201cplaying nice equates to playing dead.\u201d\nDifferent views on the topic\nRepublican officials argue they have legitimate justification for redistricting based on electoral performance, with Trump claiming Republicans are \u201centitled to five more seats\u201d because he \u201cgot the highest vote in the history of Texas\u201d and won 27 of the state\u2019s 38 congressional districts in 2024[2][4].\nThe redistricting effort addresses existing legal challenges, as the proposed map would dismantle four congressional districts that the U.S. Department of Justice said unconstitutionally combined Black and Hispanic voters, providing a legal rather than purely political rationale for the changes[3].\nMid-decade redistricting, while rare, is legally permissible and has been used before, with Republican lawmakers emphasizing that the new boundaries would reflect current political realities rather than outdated census data[1][3].\nStrategic political considerations justify the move given Republicans\u2019 historically narrow House majority of 219-212, where Democrats need to gain only three seats to retake control, making additional seats crucial for maintaining legislative effectiveness and advancing the Trump agenda[2].\nRepublican leaders frame the effort as necessary to maintain political competitiveness in a changing electoral landscape, with House Speaker Mike Johnson expressing confidence that the GOP would \u201cdefy history\u201d and \u201cgrow the majority in the House\u201d in the 2026 midterm elections despite traditional patterns favoring the opposition party[2]."

      "text": "California\u2019s redrawn congressional districts could be bad news for these Republicans\n- Share via\n- The California gerrymandering plan would increase the Democratic Party\u2019s dominance in the Golden State, adding as many as five congressional districts favorable to Democrats and leaving Republicans with as few as four of the state\u2019s 52 House seats, down from the current roster of nine.\nCalifornia Democrats and Texas Republicans are in an old-fashioned standoff, threatening to redraw their congressional maps in an attempt to sway the outcome of the 2026 midterm elections.\nCaught in the middle are a handful of California Republicans, from relative newcomers to seasoned veterans, who represent pockets of the state from the U.S.-Mexico border to the remote forests in the northeast corner.\nThe Texas GOP is pushing, at the behest of President Trump, to net five additional seats for congressional Republicans, who hold the U.S. House of Representatives by a razor-thin margin. In response, Gov. Gavin Newsom has said California will push back with a map that would increase the number of Democrats the state sends to Washington.\n\u201cThe idea that the president of the United States says he\u2019s entitled to five seats should sicken everybody,\u201d Newsom said at a news conference Thursday. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing normal about that and anyone who says it\u2019s not surprising is normalizing it. That\u2019s shocking.\u201d\nThe California gerrymandering plan taking shape behind closed doors would increase the Democratic Party\u2019s dominance in the Golden State, adding as many as five congressional districts favorable to Democrats, according to a draft map reviewed by The Times. If the Democrats succeed, those changes could leave Republicans with four of the state\u2019s 52 House seats \u2014 down from the current roster of nine.\nCalifornia\u2019s districts are typically drawn once per decade by an independent commission. Newsom is pushing to put a new map tailored to favor Democrats in front of voters Nov. 4, which would require the Legislature to approve the plan shortly after members return to Sacramento from their summer recess.\nNewsom has said California\u2019s redistricting plan will have a \u201ctrigger,\u201d meaning a redrawn map would not take effect unless Texas moved forward with its own.\n\u201cWe want to do it in the most transparent way,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cThat\u2019s a process that will unfold over the course of the next few weeks. But we want to see the maps on the ballot. I want folks to know what they\u2019re voting on. That\u2019s what separates what we\u2019re doing from what others are doing.\u201d\nThe proposed boundaries of the new congressional districts continue to shift, but the goal for California Democrats remains the same: Funnel the state\u2019s Republican voters into fewer seats, boost vulnerable Democrats and turn some GOP-dominant districts into narrowly divided toss-ups.\nHere are the Republicans who could face major changes.\nRep. Kevin Kiley (R-Rocklin)\nKiley represents a sprawling district that runs along the Nevada border from Northern California to Death Valley, cutting through Mammoth and Lake Tahoe and the cities of Roseville, Rocklin and Folsom.\nRepublicans have a 6-percentage-point voter registration advantage in Kiley\u2019s district. The district\u2019s footprint could shrink and shift closer to Sacramento, adding more registered Democrats and trimming off some conservative and rural areas.\nKiley introduced a bill this week to nullify any newly drawn congressional boundaries adopted by states before the next U.S. census, in 2030, which would apply to both Texas and California. He said the bill would \u201cstop a damaging redistricting war from breaking out across the country.\u201d\nNewsom, Kiley said, is \u201ctrying to subvert the will of voters and do lasting damage to democracy in California.\u201d\nRep. Doug LaMalfa (R-Richvale)\nLaMalfa represents a safe Republican district that stretches through a vast territory of Northern California that borders Oregon and Nevada. The district includes Chico, Redding and Yuba City.\nLaMalfa said in an interview that he had seen one map that shifted his district south to include parts of Sonoma County wine country and shifted some conservative rural areas in the north in another lawmaker\u2019s district. Those changes, he said, would put towns near the Oregon border and Marin County, just north of the Golden Gate Bridge, in the same district.\n\u201cThe Democrats are really way over the line on this,\u201d LaMalfa said. \u201cI hope the weight of how bad this looks collapses on them before we even have to go through these gyrations, and millions and millions of dollars.\u201d\nHe said he was certain that Republicans would litigate the new map if Democrats push ahead. He said other groups, including Common Cause and the League of Women Voters, have also voiced concerns.\n\u201cI\u2019m not even stressed,\u201d said La Malfa, a fourth-generation rice farmer. \u201cIf they throw me in some wine country district or some coastal district, and that throws me out, then I can go over here and finish cutting apart this tree that fell on my fence last night.\u201d\nRep. David Valadao (R-Hanford)\nThe proposed plans could add more registered Democrats to Valadao\u2019s predominately Latino district in the Central Valley.\nDemocrats have tried for years to unseat Valadao, who represents a district that has a strong Democratic voter registration advantage on paper, but where turnout among blue voters is lackluster.\nEven before the redistrict dustup, Valadao was once again a top target for Democrats. Valadao represents the California district with the highest percentage of Medicaid recipients, many of whom may lose coverage because of legislation approved by the Republican-led Congress and signed by Trump. Valadao previously lost his congressional seat in 2018 after voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017.\nA representative for Valadao didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\nReps. Ken Calvert (R-Corona) and Young Kim (R-Anaheim Hills)\nThe plan being considered could force two Republican members of the House into the same district: Kim and Calvert.\nCalvert was first elected to Congress in 1992 and is the longest-serving member of California\u2019s Republican delegation. He represents a Riverside County district that includes Lake Elsinore, Menifee, Palm Springs and his home base of Corona. The district, which leans Republican, has been a prime, but unsuccessful, target for Democrats in the last two elections.\nKim, who was first elected to Congress in 2020, represents a Republican district, mostly in Orange County, that includes Mission Viejo, Orange, Lake Forest, Anaheim and Tustin.\nCalvert said he strongly opposes \u201cthe scheme being orchestrated behind closed doors by Sacramento politicians\u201d to replace maps drawn by the redistricting commission \u201cwith a process that would allow legislators to draw district maps that are gerrymandered to benefit themselves and their political allies.\u201d\nDeviating from the independent redistricting process \u201cdisenfranchises voters and degrades trust in our political system,\u201d Kim said in a statement. She said Newsom should, \u201cfor once, focus on addressing the pressing issues making life harder for Californians under his watch instead of trying to position himself for a presidential run.\u201d\nNewsom this week said he was pleased to see Republican members coming out in support of independent redistricting.\n\u201cThat\u2019s an encouraging sign,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cSo already, perhaps, people are waking up to the reality of California entering into this conversation. We\u2019re not a small state. Again, we punch above our weight. It will have profound national implications if we move forward.\u201d\nRep. Darrell Issa (R-Bonsall)\nUnder the tentative plans, Issa, who has served in Congress for more than two decades, would see his safely Republican district become purple. That could include absorbing Palm Springs, a liberal area that is currently in Calvert\u2019s district and has become a hub of fundraising and political activity for Democrats.\nA spokesman for Issa declined to comment but referred to a statement from the state\u2019s nine-member Republican delegation, which said that Trump won 38% of the presidential vote in California last year, but Republicans hold fewer than 1 in 5 of the state\u2019s 52 House seats.\nNewsom, the delegation said, is trying to wrest power from the independent redistricting commission and \u201cplace it back into the hands of Sacramento politicians to further his left-wing political agenda.\u201d\n\u201cA partisan political gerrymander is not what the voters of California want,\u201d the statement said.\nTimes staff writer Taryn Luna contributed to this report."

Gavin Newsom met in Sacramento to discuss a national political fight over electoral maps that could alter the outcome of the midterm elections.\n- At the urging of President Trump, Republicans in Texas are attempting to redistrict the Lone Star State to pick up seats in Congress.\n- Newsom has threatened to mirror Trump\u2019s tactics and said he\u2019s in talks with leaders of the California Legislature to redistrict to favor Democrats.\nGov. Gavin Newsom stood alongside six Democrats from the Texas Legislature on Friday and joined them in accusing President Trump and Republicans of trying to \u201crig\u201d elections to hold onto congressional seats next year.\n\u201cThey play by a different set of rules and we could sit back and act as if we have some moral authority and watch this 249-, 250-year-old experiment be washed away,\u201d Newsom said of the nation\u2019s history. \u201cWe are not going to allow that to happen.\u201d\nThe Texas lawmakers and the governor spoke with reporters after meeting privately at the Governor\u2019s Mansion in Sacramento to discuss a national political fight over electoral maps that could alter the outcome of the midterm elections and balance of power in Congress.\nAt the urging of President Trump, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called his state Legislature into a special session this week that includes a call to redistrict the Lone Star State to help Republicans pick up seats in Congress.\nThe move is part of a gerrymandering effort pushed by Trump to prevent the GOP from losing control of the House of Representatives next year. If Democrats take the House, they could derail the president\u2019s agenda, which has so far included a crackdown on undocumented immigrants, tariffs on imports, rescinding efforts to combat climate change and undercutting state protections for the LGTBQ+ community, among other policy priorities.\nNewsom has threatened to mirror Trump\u2019s tactics and said he\u2019s in talks with leaders of the California Legislature to redraw the state\u2019s congressional districts to favor electing more Democrats and fewer Republicans.\nTexas Democrats, who said they traveled to California to meet with the governor and explain the state of play in Texas, pledged do everything in their power to push back against Trump\u2019s plan.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to use every tool at our disposal in the state of Texas to confront this very illegal redistricting process that is going to be done on the backs of historic African American and Latino districts,\u201d said Texas state Rep. Rafael Anch\u00eda.\nAnother group of Texas lawmakers are expected to meet with Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker in Chicago.\nAs Texas, under pressure from President Trump, considers redrawing congressional lines to boost GOP numbers in Congress, California considers responding by boosting the state\u2019s Democratic districts.\nChanging the maps to benefit Democrats is a massive departure from California\u2019s work over the last decade to remove political partisanship from the redistricting process.\nCalifornia voters in 2010 gave an independent Citizens Redistricting Commission the power to determine the boundaries of voting districts for the U.S. House of Representatives instead of leaving that authority with the state Legislature.\nTo redistrict before the midterms, the most legally sound option is for state lawmakers to send a constitutional amendment to voters that seeks to allow changes to the voter map outside the boundaries of California\u2019s independent redistricting process. The vote would need to happen in a special election before the June primary.\nNewsom has said he\u2019s also exploring a potential legal loophole that could allow the California Legislature to redraw the congressional maps themselves with a two-thirds vote.\nThe governor\u2019s office said state law charges the redistricting commission with crafting new maps after a census, which is conducted about every 10 years. But they say the law is silent on everything that happens in between that time period.\nNewsom\u2019s lawyers believe it could be possible for the Legislature to redistrict congressional seats mid-decade on its own without going to the ballot.\nTexas Republicans are poised to redraw the state\u2019s congressional map in hopes of flipping more seats in their favor. But history suggests the plan could backfire.\nThe governor\u2019s call to fight Trump using his own gerrymandering tactics has drawn a mixed response.\nNewsom argues that Democrats will continue to lose if they remain the only party that plays by the rules. But others worry about the integrity of electoral outcomes across the nation if political parties in every state resort to naked political gamesmanship to gain control.\nTexas Republicans have long been accused of crafting political maps to dilute the power of Black and Latino voters, which led to an ongoing lawsuit from 2021. Newsom\u2019s effort in California would effectively seek to increase the share of Democrats in Republican-held districts.\nRedistricting experts in California say redrawing the maps in the Golden State could create the potential for Democrats to flip at least five of the seats held by GOP incumbents.\nDemocrats may have the potential for greater gains from gerrymandering, particularly in places such as California that have attempted to practice nonpartisan redistricting, compared to states such as Texas, where maps are already drawn in favor of Republicans.\n\u201cIt should be no surprise to anybody who covers Texas that every decade since 1970 Texas has been found to discriminate against people of color in its redistricting process,\u201d Anch\u00eda said.\n\u201cIn trying to do this, it is going to create great harm, not only to the people we represent, to the voters of the state of Texas, but also potentially to all Americans,\u201d he said about Trump\u2019s plan.\nIt\u2019s common for the party in control of the White House to lose seats nationally in the first election after a presidential contest. Republicans hold majorities in the Senate and the House, and losing power to Democrats could be detrimental to Trump\u2019s presidency.\nTrump\u2019s job approval rating dropped to a second-term low of 37% in a Gallup poll conducted earlier this month. The dip is just above his lowest approval rating ever of 34% at the end of his first term.\nTrump has said publicly that he thinks it\u2019s possible for Republicans to redistrict and pick up five seats in Texas, with the potential for gains in other states that redraw their maps."

      "text": "23% of California Democratic Primary voters support Newsom for 2028 presidential bid\nA new Emerson College Polling survey of California voters finds former Democratic Representative Katie Porter leading the primary for California governor with 18%, followed by Republican political commentator Steve Hilton at 12%, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco at 7%, and former Democratic Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa at 5%. A plurality of voters (38%) are undecided.\n\u201cWith Kamala Harris officially out of the race, Katie Porter has emerged as the Democratic frontrunner, increasing her support from 12% to 18% since the April Emerson poll,\u201d Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said. \u201cSteve Hilton, who was not in the race in April, has jumped to 12%, while the share of undecided voters has dropped from 54% to 38% over the summer. Porter leads among voters over 50 (22%), those with a postgraduate degree (35%), and white voters (23%).\u201d\nLooking ahead to the 2028 presidential nomination contest, Governor Gavin Newsom leads the Democratic primary with 23%, followed by former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg at 17%, Vice President Kamala Harris at 11%, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at 9%. In the Republican primary, 40% support Vice President JD Vance, 10% support Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, and 9% Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.\nGovernor Gavin Newsom holds a 44% job approval rating, and 38% disapproval. President Trump holds a 30% job approval among California voters, and 58% disapproval.\nOn the generic congressional ballot, Democrats have a 22-point advantage: 54% support the Democratic candidate while 32% support the Republican; 15% are undecided.\nA third of voters (33%) support the proposal to redraw California\u2019s congressional map ahead of the 2026 Midterm Elections, while a quarter (25%) oppose; 42% are unsure.\n\u201cSupport to redraw the state\u2019s congressional map ahead of the Midterm Elections is strongest among Democrats by a 23-point margin, 42% to 19%, and opposed by an eight-point margin among Republicans, 36% to 28%. A majority of independent voters are unsure, while 25% oppose and 23% support,\u201d Kimball said.\nThe economy is the top issue for 30% of California voters, down from 40% in April, followed by housing affordability at 19%, immigration at 15% (up from 7% in April), threats to democracy at 13%, and healthcare at 8%. Housing affordability is 14 points higher for California voters compared to U.S. voters overall, while concern for threats to democracy is ten points lower than the national poll.\nA majority (61%) of California voters view tariffs as more of a tax on U.S. consumers, while 26% view tariffs as a tax on the foreign country.\n- Democrats view tariffs as a tax on the consumer, 79% to 11%, while Republicans see tariffs as a tax on the foreign country, 54% to 32%.\nA majority of California voters (60%) think mass deportations of undocumented/illegal immigrants in California are a bad thing, consistent with the April Emerson poll; 40% think mass deportations are a good thing.\nForty-nine percent of voters think the California government should spend more on firefighter staffing and equipment, knowing that increased funding may require a tax increase, down from 62% in February; 43% think the government should spend the same, up eight points from February, and 8% think it should spend less.\nJust over half of California voters (51%) agree that Los Angeles is an ideal host city for the 2028 Summer Olympic Games, while 27% disagree. Twenty-three percent are unsure.\n- Black voters (64%), voters aged 30-39 (57%), male voters (54%), and college-educated voters (54%) most agree that Los Angeles is an ideal host city for the Olympics.\n- Republican voters (42%) and voters aged 50-59 (33%) are most likely to disagree that Los Angeles is an ideal host city for the 2028 Summer Olympic Games.\nMethodology\nThe Emerson College Polling California survey was conducted August 4-5, 2025. The overall sample of California active registered voters, n=1,000, has a credibility interval, similar to a poll\u2019s margin of error (MOE), of +/- 3 percentage points. The Democratic Primary has a sample size of n=444 likely primary voters with a credibility interval of +/- 4.6. The Republican Primary has a sample size of n=221 likely primary voters with a credibility interval of +/- 6.6%. The data sets were weighted by gender, education, race, age, party registration, and region based on U.S. Census parameters and voter file data.\nIt is important to remember that subsets based on demographics, such as gender, age, education, and race/ethnicity, carry with them higher credibility intervals, as the sample size is reduced. Survey results should be understood within the poll\u2019s range of scores, and with a confidence interval of 95% a poll will fall outside the range of scores 1 in 20 times.\nData was collected by contacting a voter list of cellphones via MMS-to-web text and emails (lists provided by Aristotle), and an online panel of voters provided by Commonwealth Opinions Panel and CINT. Panel responses were matched to the Aristotle voter file using respondents\u2019 full name and ZIP code. The survey was offered in English.\nAll questions asked in this survey with the exact wording, along with full results, demographics, and cross tabulations can be found under Full Results. This survey was funded by Emerson College."

      "text": "- Share via\nGov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s political ambitions have reached a new low. In his efforts to look like a \u201cfighter\u201d ahead of a potential run for the presidency in 2028, he\u2019s willing to ignore democratic rules in pursuit of political aims, setting aside the state\u2019s independent redistricting system to counter Texas Republicans\u2019 proposed partisan gerrymander. Newsom and his allies want to maximize the number of California Democrats elected to Congress in next year\u2019s midterm elections.\nIn 2008 and 2010, California voters passed ballot initiatives that gave the power to draw the state\u2019s legislative and congressional district lines to the California Citizens Redistricting Commission, a 14-person independent body composed of five Democrats, five Republicans and four people who are registered with neither of the two major parties. Potential commissioners go through an extensive vetting and selection process (which the state Legislature participates in) and are prohibited from many forms of political activism, including donating to candidates, running for office or working for elected officials.\nOne-party Democratic rule in Sacramento is smothering innovation, accountability and true debate on critical issues facing California.\nSince the latest redistricting, in 2021 \u2014 triggered as usual by the constitutionally mandated decennial census \u2014 the map crafted by the commission has survived legal and political challenges, and the current districts are set to be in place through the next round of redistricting in 2031.\nNow Newsom wants to prematurely redraw the lines and craft his own partisan gerrymander for the November 2026 midterm elections, wresting control of the process away from the commission and giving it instead to the Democratic majority in the state Legislature. Last week, Newsom confirmed that he will call a special election to get voter approval for this end-run around the commission, but even dressed up with a vote, this is cynical politics, not democracy, at work.\nNewsom\u2019s excuse is the sudden partisan redistricting Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and President Trump are backing to increase the number of Republicans elected to Congress from that state, and in turn, to enhance the party\u2019s chances to retain control of the U.S. House of Representatives.\nGov. Gavin Newsom said Monday he plans to put new district lines in front of voters in a special election on Nov. 4, but only if Texas moves forward with its redistricting plans.\nCalifornia Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas (D-Hollister) calls the Texas action a \u201cTrumpian power grab,\u201d and Newsom assails it as the \u201crigging of the system by the president of the United States.\u201d (Recent public opinion research conducted by Newsom\u2019s pollster revealed that the public is more likely to support a California redistricting maneuver if the fight has Trump, not Texas, as the central villain.)\nBut two wrongs don\u2019t make a right.\nA key difference between the proposed line redrawing in Texas and the California plan is that the former, however brazen, is legal and precedented, while the latter specifically contravenes California law and the expressed will of the state\u2019s voters. In Texas, legislators are entrusted with drawing district lines, and a mid-decade partisan gerrymander they executed in 2003, again to boost Republican representation in the U.S. House, was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court (except for one district whose lines violated the Voting Rights Act).\nDemocrats in the Texas House have fled in an attempt to prevent a vote Monday on Trump-backed maps designed to add GOP seats in Congress.\nBut California voters explicitly placed the drawing of district lines in the hands of the independent citizens\u2019 commission to take politicians out of the process. Commissioners draw district lines based on numerous factors, including laws, judicial decisions and population shifts. They\u2019re bound by a basic rule: District lines cannot be drawn to purposefully benefit a specific party or candidate. And all the commission\u2019s deliberations must happen in public. The maps they\u2019ve devised have been criticized by both Democrats and Republicans; and that\u2019s one of the many reasons why California voters entrusted the commission with this important power.\nIf Newsom gets his way, California\u2019s districts for the 2026 midterm will ensure the election of as few Republicans as possible. Recent reports suggest that his gerrymander will mean Republicans win only four out of 52 House seats (9%), compared with the current California delegation, which includes nine Republicans (17%). Republicans make up about 25% of California\u2019s registered voters and statewide Republican candidates have won roughly 40% of the vote over the last few election cycles.\nThe Latino electorate was critical in securing a win for Trump in 2024. Can the Republican Party count on them for control of Congress?\nThe fact that Newsom\u2019s plan returns the power to redistrict to the citizens commission after the midterms makes it no less a subversion of the democratically expressed will of California\u2019s voters. To add insult to injury, the cost of the special election to ratify the scheme is estimated to be about $60 million in Los Angeles County alone, with statewide costs likely exceeding $200 million.\nBy bending electoral rules in service of their own political interests, Newsom and California Democrats become no better than Abbott and Texas Republicans. And Newsom\u2019s hypocrisy strains the credibility of his argument that Trump and his allies are diminishing democracy.\nIf Newsom moves forward with his cynical plan, Californians will at least have the power to reject it at the ballot box this November. Voters should reinforce their commitment to minimizing the role of partisanship and politics in redistricting, and to the independent California Citizens Redistricting Commission.\nLanhee J.

The Los Angeles Times editorial staff does not create or edit the content.\nIdeas expressed in the piece\nThe author characterizes Governor Newsom\u2019s redistricting plan as a cynical political maneuver driven by presidential ambitions rather than democratic principles, arguing that the governor is willing to ignore established democratic rules to appear as a \u201cfighter\u201d for a potential 2028 presidential run.\nCalifornia voters deliberately established the independent Citizens Redistricting Commission through ballot initiatives in 2008 and 2010 to remove politicians from the redistricting process, creating a 14-person body with balanced partisan representation that must draw district lines based on legal requirements rather than political benefit[2][4].\nThe proposed plan represents a fundamental subversion of the democratically expressed will of California voters, as it would temporarily wrest control from the independent commission and place it in the hands of the Democratic-controlled state Legislature, directly contradicting the intent of the voter-approved system.\nWhile Texas Republicans\u2019 redistricting efforts may be politically brazen, they remain legal and precedented within Texas law, whereas California\u2019s plan specifically contravenes state law and the expressed will of voters who explicitly removed redistricting power from politicians[1][3].\nThe financial cost of implementing this plan would be substantial, with estimates suggesting approximately $60 million for Los Angeles County alone and statewide costs likely exceeding $200 million for the special election needed to ratify the scheme.\nThe plan would create an extreme partisan gerrymander that would reduce Republican representation from nine House seats to potentially only four out of 52 total seats, despite Republicans comprising about 25% of California\u2019s registered voters and Republican candidates typically winning roughly 40% of the vote in statewide elections.\nDifferent views on the topic\nNewsom and Democratic supporters frame the redistricting plan as a necessary defensive response to President Trump\u2019s broader nationwide push for Republican redistricting efforts, with the California governor stating that Trump is likely \u201cmaking similar calls all across this country\u201d and comparing it to Trump\u2019s efforts to \u201cfind\u201d votes in Georgia after the 2020 election[3].\nThe plan includes a \u201ctrigger\u201d mechanism designed to ensure California would only proceed with redistricting if Texas Republicans move forward with their own map changes, with Newsom emphasizing this is \u201ccause and effect, triggered on the basis of what occurs or doesn\u2019t occur in Texas\u201d[3].\nDemocratic lawmakers and California congressional delegation members have signaled support for the retaliatory redistricting effort, meeting with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries to discuss possible Democratic responses to Texas\u2019 redistricting plan[1].\nProponents argue that the independent redistricting commission is only constitutionally mandated to draw new lines once every decade, leaving the process for mid-decade redistricting legally open and available for legislative or voter-approved changes[1].\nAssembly Speaker Robert Rivas characterizes the Texas redistricting effort as a \u201cTrumpian power grab,\u201d while Newsom describes it as the \u201crigging of the system by the president of the United States,\u201d positioning California\u2019s response as protecting democratic representation against Republican manipulation[3].\nDemocratic supporters view the plan as the last bulwark against Republican control of the House of Representatives after the 2026 midterm elections, which they see as crucial for checking President Trump\u2019s actions during his second term[3]."

      "text": "How California draws congressional districts, and why it might change in a proxy war with Trump\n- Share via\n- Congressional district maps have been drawn by an independent commission since 2011, after voters passed a ballot measure intended to stop gerrymandering, incumbent protection and grotesquely shaped boundaries created for purely partisan purposes.\n- California Democrats are considering giving state lawmakers the ability to draw district lines before the 2026 midterm election, in an attempt to counter Texas Republicans potentially redrawing their districts to boost GOP numbers in the House.\nThe potential redrawing of California\u2019s congressional district lines could upend the balance of power in Washington, D.C., in next year\u2019s midterm congressional election. The unusual and unexpected redistricting may take place in coming months because of sparring among President Trump, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\nRedrawing these maps \u2014 known as redistricting \u2014 is an esoteric practice that many voters tune out, but one that has an outsized impact on political power and policy in the United States.\nHere is a breakdown about why a process that typically occurs once every decade is currently receiving so much attention \u2014 and the potential ramifications.\nWhat is redistricting?\nThere are 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, each of whom is supposed to represent roughly the same number of constituents. Every decade, after the U.S. Census counts the population across the nation, the allocation of congressional representatives for each state can change. For example, after the 2020 census, California\u2019s share of congressional districts was reduced by one for the first time in state history.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau released apportionment data, but the pandemic-induced lag has already caused ripple effects on redistricting and 2022 races.\nAfter the decennial census, states redraw district lines for congressional and legislative districts based on population shifts, protections for minority voters required by the federal Voting Rights Act and other factors. For much of the nation\u2019s history, such maps were created by state legislators and moneyed interests in smoke-filled backrooms.\nMany districts were grossly gerrymandered \u2014 contorted \u2014 to benefit political parties and incumbents, such as California\u2019s infamous \u201cRibbon of Shame,\u201d a congressional district that stretched in a reed-thin line 200 miles along the California coast from Oxnard to the Monterey County line.\nBut in recent decades, political-reform organizations and some elected officials, notably former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, called for independent drawing of district lines. In 2010, the state\u2019s voters overwhelmingly approved a ballot measure requiring California congressional maps to be drawn by a bipartisan commission, which it did in 2011 and 2021.\nNearly one-third of state\u2019s districts in Congress would have Latino majorities under independent commission\u2019s plan. The new map also endangers some GOP incumbents.\nWhy are we talking about this?\nPresident Trump recently urged Texas lawmakers to redraw its congressional districts to increase the number of GOP members of the House in next year\u2019s midterm election. Congress is closely divided, and the party that does not control the White House traditionally loses seats in the body two years after the presidential election.\nTrump has been able to enact his agenda \u2014 from deporting undocumented immigrants to extending tax breaks that largely benefit the wealthy to closing some Planned Parenthood clinics \u2014 because the GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. But if Democrats flip Congress, Trump\u2019s agenda will likely be stymied and he faces the prospect of being a lame duck during his last two years in office.\nWhat is Texas doing?\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott called his state\u2019s Legislature into special session last week to discuss the disastrous floods that killed more than 130 people as well as redistricting before the 2026 election.\nTrump and his administration urged Abbott to redraw his state\u2019s congressional lines with the hope of picking up five seats.\nTexas Republicans are poised to redraw the state\u2019s congressional map in hopes of flipping more seats in their favor. But history suggests the plan could backfire.\nAbbott has said that his decision to include redistricting in the special session was prompted by a court decision last year that said the state no longer has to draw \u201ccoalition districts\u201d that are made up of multiple minority communities. New district lines would give Texans greater opportunity to vote for politicians who best represent them, the governor said in interviews.\nDemocrats in the Lone Star state\u2019s Legislature met with Newsom in Sacramento on Friday to discuss the ramifications of mid-decade redistricting and accused Trump of trying to rig next year\u2019s midterm election to hold onto power.\nRepublicans \u201cplay by a different set of rules and we could sit back and act as if we have some moral authority and watch this 249-, 250-year-old experiment be washed away,\u201d Newsom said of the nation\u2019s history. \u201cWe are not going to allow that to happen.\u201d\nDemocratic lawmakers in Texas have previously fled the state to not allow the Legislature to have a quorum, such as in 2021 during a battle over voting rights. But with the deadly flooding, this is an unlikely prospect this year.\nWhy is California in the mix?\nThe Golden State\u2019s congressional districts are drawn by an independent commission focused on logical geography, shared interests, representation for minority communities and other facets.\nIf the state reverts to partisan map drawing, redistricting experts on both sides of the aisle agree that several GOP incumbents in the 52-member delegation would be vulnerable, either because of more Democratic voters being placed in their districts, or being forced into face-offs with fellow Republican members of Congress. There are currently nine Republican members of the delegation, a number that could shrink to three or four, according to political statisticians.\nAs Texas, under pressure from President Trump, considers redrawing congressional lines to boost GOP numbers in Congress, California considers responding by boosting the state\u2019s Democratic districts.\nStrange bedfellows\nThese dizzying developments have created agreement among rivals while dividing former allies.\nSara Sadhwani, a member of the 2021 redistricting commission and longtime supporter of independent map drawing, said she supports Democratic efforts to change California\u2019s congressional districts before the midterm election.\n\u201cI stand by the work of the commission of course. We drew fair and competitive maps that fully abided by federal laws around the Voting Rights Act to ensure communities of color have an equal opportunity at the ballot box,\u201d said Sadhwani, a politics professor at Pomona College. \u201cThat being said, especially when it comes to Congress, most certainly California playing fair puts Democrats at a disadvantage nationally.\u201d\nShe said the best policy would be for all 50 states to embrace independent redistricting. But in the meantime, she supports Democratic efforts in California to temporarily redraw the districts given the stakes.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s patriotic to fight against what appears to be our democracy falling into what appears to be authoritarian rule,\u201d Sadhwani said.\nCharles Munger Jr., the son of a late billionaire who was Warren Buffet\u2019s right-hand man, spent more than $12 million to support the ballot measure that created the independent redistricting commission and is invested in making sure that it is not weakened.\n\u201cHe\u2019s very much committed to making sure the commission is preserved,\u201d said someone close to Munger who requested anonymity to speak candidly. Munger believes \u201cthis is ultimately political quicksand and a redistricting war at the end of day is a loss to American voters.\u201d\nMunger, who was the state GOP\u2019s biggest donor at one point, is actively involved in the California fight and is researching other efforts to fight gerrymandering nationwide, this person said.\nThe state Democratic and Republican parties, which rarely agree on anything, agreed in 2010 when they opposed the ballot measure. Now, Democrats, who would likely gain seats if the districts are redrawn by state lawmakers, support a mid-decade redistricting, while the state GOP, which would likely lose seats, says the state should continue having lines drawn by the independent commission once every decade.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that Governor Newsom and the radical Left in Sacramento are willing to spend $200 million on a statewide special election, while running a deficit of $20 billion, in order to silence the opposition in our state,\u201d the GOP congressional delegation said in a statement on Friday. \u201cAs a Delegation we will fight any attempt to disenfranchise California voters by whatever means necessary to ensure the will of the people continues to be reflected in redistricting and in our elections.\u201d\nWhat happens next?\nIf Democrats in California move forward with their proposal, which is dependent on what Texas lawmakers do during their special legislative session that began last week, they have two options:\n- State lawmakers could vote to put the measure before voters in a special election that would likely be held in November \u2014 a costly prospect. The last statewide special election \u2014 the unsuccessful effort to recall Newsom in 2021 \u2014 cost more than $200 million, according to the secretary of state\u2019s office.\n- The Legislature could also vote to redraw the maps, but this option would likely be more vulnerable to legal challenge.\nEither scenario is expected to be voted on as an urgency item, which requires a 2/3 vote but would insulate the action from being the subject of a referendum later put in front of voters that would delay enactment.\nThe Legislature is out of session until mid-August.\nTimes staff writer Taryn Luna in Sacramento contributed to this report."
