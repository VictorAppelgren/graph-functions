  "content": "The Mariners made a major roster move that will impact how they play over the next few weeks.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, Seattle reinstated outfielder Victor Robles from the 60-day injured list. To make room for Robles on the active 40-man rooster, longtime utility player Dylan Moore was designated for assignment.\n\nRobles was recently suspended for 10 games by Major League Baseball for throwing his bat at a pitcher during a game while on rehab assignment with Triple-A Tacoma.\n\nThe suspension was set to begin whenever Robles was activated from the injured list. However, since Robles has filed an official appeal, the suspension is in abeyance, meaning he can still play until a ruling is made.\n\nMoore, who was the longest-tenured player on the Mariners roster, has struggled since a hot start in April. He had just three hits in his past 74 plate appearances with seven walks and 38 strikeouts.\n\nIf he clears waivers, he can decline an outright assignment to the minor leagues and become a free agent.\n\nThis story will be updated.",

      "text": "Victor Robles\u2019 return to the Mariners will be delayed, not because of a setback or an injury, but due to a punishment for throwing his bat at an opposing player.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Major League Baseball announced that Robles has received a 10-game suspension and undisclosed fine for his actions Sunday, while playing in the fourth game of his rehab stint with Triple-A Tacoma. The suspension must be served at the MLB level, meaning it will go into effect whenever Robles is reinstated from the injured list.\nRobles will appeal the suspension. He could have it reduced by a game or two at most. He is still eligible to participate on his current rehab assignment while the appeals process is being concluded.\nWhen the Mariners reinstate Robles from the injured list and add him to the active 26-man roster, he will begin serving his suspension. During that time, the team cannot add a player to the roster to take his place. The Mariners will have to play without a 13th position player.\nRobles has missed most of the season after suffering a left shoulder separation and small fracture while making a catch during the first road trip of the season. The initial plan was for him to accumulate 50 plate appearances on the rehab assignment and then be reinstated around Sept. 1 when MLB rosters expand by one pitcher and one position player. If the Mariners stay on that plan and reinstate him on Sept. 1, they would still have 13 position players while Robles serves his suspension.\nThe incident occurred Sunday evening at Las Vegas Ballpark when Aviators starting pitcher Joey Estes threw a fastball up and inside that Robles swung at almost out of defense. The pitch still struck him in the upper body, but was ruled a foul ball. Stunned by the impact, Robles fell backward out of the box, dropping his bat and losing his helmet.\nHaving been hit by pitches three times already in the series by Las Vegas pitchers, including a fastball to the ribs from Estes a few days earlier, Robles became enraged. He grabbed his bat, flinging it at Estes and then started walking toward the mound for a confrontation. He was immediately ejected and had to be restrained by teammates. Robles fought leaving the field and later threw a case of sunflower seed packages on the field from the dugout.\nHad Robles simply charged the mound to confront Estes, the punishment would be less severe. But throwing his bat is what earned him the 10-game suspension.\nRobles issued an apology on Instagram after the incident, writing:\n\u201cI want to take a moment to sincerely apologize for my recent reaction on the field. I let my frustration get the best of me, and I understand how that may have affected not just the game, but the energy and respect we all work so hard to maintain.\nComing off a long rehab and being away from the game for most of the season has been physically and mentally challenging. Adding to that, the recent passing of my mother has been incredibly hard, and I\u2019ve been doing my best to hold it together. That\u2019s not an excuse, but some context I feel you deserve to understand where I\u2019m coming from.\nGetting hit 5 times in 15 at-bats added to that pressure, and I reacted in a way I\u2019m not proud of. This game means the world to me, and so do the people who play it. I respect every one of you \u2014 my teammates, the opposing players, and everyone in this league. I\u2019m committed to being better, not just as a player, but as a teammate and competitor. I appreciate your understanding, and I\u2019m grateful to be back on the field doing what I love. Thank you.\u201d\nThe opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times."

      "text": "Let\u2019s start by acknowledging the obvious.\nNo, Victor Robles should not have hurled his bat at Las Vegas Aviators pitcher Joey Estes on Sunday, after a rising fastball ricocheted off the swinging, spinning Robles\u2019 front shoulder. No, Robles should not have barreled toward the mound, causing benches to clear, before finally being restrained by arriving Rainiers. No, Robles should not have resorted to petty littering, tossing a bucket of sunflower seeds onto the field to punctuate his tantrum.\nYou don\u2019t need me to tell you Robles hurt his team. He\u2019s lucky he didn\u2019t hurt anyone more literally.\nSo, the accompanying punishment \u2014 a 10-game suspension, which must be served at the major-league level \u2014 is swift, severe \u2026 and fair. The league can\u2019t show leniency when it comes to flying projectiles and the safety of its players. The result must be reprimanded, regardless of reasons.\nAll of which serves the Mariners a regrettable riddle. The 28-year-old was expected to provide a September spark similar to what we saw last season \u2014 when he slashed .328/.393/.467 with four homers, 20 doubles, 26 RBI and 30 stolen bases in 77 games after being waived by Washington. He was supposed to contribute trademark energy for a furious final sprint, as the Mariners contend for an AL West title or a consolatory wild-card spot. He was supposed to positively impact a right-field rotation that currently includes Dominic Canzone, Luke Raley and Dylan Moore.\nNow, it\u2019s not as simple as immediately elevating Robles and starting the 10-day countdown so he\u2019s ready when September starts. Doing so would force the Mariners to play a man down on their active roster, depleting an already stretched bullpen and bench. But if they wait to reinstate Robles until rosters expand Sept. 1, he\u2019d be eligible to play in just 15 games to end the regular season.\nThe Mariners front office has yet to decide how to proceed, president of baseball operations Jerry Dipoto told The Times\u2019 Adam Jude on Tuesday.\nThis, for a team that entered the afternoon having lost five of its past six games on a relentless road trip, is a mess of Robles\u2019 making.\nThat said, let\u2019s consider both of the following facts:\nVictor Robles hurt his team.\nIt\u2019s not so simple.\nThe right fielder\u2019s eruption was preceded by a flurry of falling dominoes. Like the left shoulder separation and fracture that occurred just 10 games into the season, leaving the Mariners leadoff man to languish in a five-month limbo. Like the fact that he finally had returned for a rehab assignment in Triple-A Tacoma, only to be hit by three pitches in his first four games. Like he and Estes\u2019 troubled, tangled history; the right-hander nearly hit Robles earlier in Sunday\u2019s game and previously plunked him in the same series. Plus, Estes (while with the Athletics) hit Robles with another 91-mph fastball late last season.\nNot to mention the recent death of Robles\u2019 mother, which he disclosed in an apology on Instagram.\n\u201cComing off a long rehab and being away from the game for most of the season has been physically and mentally challenging. Adding to that, the recent passing of my mother has been incredibly hard, and I\u2019ve been doing my best to hold it together,\u201d Robles wrote. \u201cThat\u2019s not an excuse, but some context I feel you deserve to understand where I\u2019m coming from.\u201d\nThere are, of course, no acceptable excuses when it comes to whipping your bat at an opposing player. That should not have to be said. A professional athlete, and a role model, is responsible for his actions, regardless of the real and considerable trauma he takes into the game.\nBut I\u2019m not here to blindly dismiss or demonize Robles, either. Not when I can\u2019t remotely put myself in his place, or understand the anguish swirling inside of him. Not when the levied suspension is punishment aplenty. Not when each of our dominoes is different.\nThe Mariners, meanwhile, should be talented and deep enough to overcome this quandary \u2014 especially in an unintimidating American League. By trading for Josh Naylor and Eugenio Su\u00e1rez, they eliminated all available excuses. Robles would not be single-handedly responsible if the slumping Mariners stumble down the stretch.\nRobles put himself in this position. He doesn\u2019t need me or you to drop another hammer. He needs to learn from it and heal, holistically. He needs to come back better, which only partially applies to baseball.\nRobles\u2019 response will matter more than one unsightly mistake.\nThe opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times."
