  "content": "\u2022 A TikTok user damaged their MacBook display in an unexpected way\n\u2022 The issue was caused by a piece of card placed under the lid\n\u2022 Even something as innocuous as this can break a laptop screen\n\nFor many MacBook owners, it\u2019s a nightmare come true: you open the lid of your pricey laptop and switch it on, only to find the display is a mess, with black bars and glitchy colors everywhere you look. The screen has been ruined, and it\u2019s going to cost a whole lot to put it right.\n\nWorryingly, it\u2019s actually a lot easier to experience this than you might expect: just one seemingly innocuous action can cause hundreds of dollars of damage.\n\nThat\u2019s something TikTok user classicheidi found out the hard way. In a video uploaded to the social media platform, classicheidi explained that they had placed a piece of card on the keyboard of their MacBook Air, then closed the lid.\n\nWhen they opened it again a while later, the screen was ruined.\n\nThis is an unfortunate incident, but there\u2019s a reason it happened. It\u2019s not because the displays of Apple\u2019s laptops (or those of any other manufacturer, for that matter) are weak or poorly made. But while they should certainly be treated with care, there\u2019s another issue at play.\n\nIt\u2019s what Apple describes in a support document as the \u201ctight tolerances\u201d of its laptops. Apple\u2019s MacBooks are made to be as thin as possible, which means the gap between the keyboard and display is very small when the lid is closed.\n\nAnything placed in that gap \u2013 even something as modest as a piece of card \u2013 can be pushed up against the display, with the resulting pressure leading to serious damage.\n\nFor that reason, Apple warns that \u201cleaving any material on your display, keyboard, or palm rest might interfere with the display when it\u2019s closed and cause damage to your display.\u201d If you have a camera cover, a palm rest cover, or a keyboard cover, Apple says you should remove it before closing your laptop\u2019s lid to avoid this kind of scenario \u2013 unfortunately, it\u2019s something we've seen before.\n\nIf you want to sidestep the kind of outcome classicheidi suffered, it\u2019s important to ensure there\u2019s nothing between your laptop\u2019s keyboard and screen when you close it. If there is, you might open it up to \u201cthe biggest jump scare of the century,\u201d in classicheidi\u2019s words.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 Recall or free repair?

Some users do so for privacy reasons, not trusting that their camera might be hijacked in some manner (remember the famous cases of Mark Zuckerberg taping over his webcam, and indeed the director of the FBI).\nHowever, Apple further explains that there is a green light to clearly show when your camera is active, if it has been hijacked.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nApple says: \u201cThe FaceTime HD camera built into your Mac computer is designed with your privacy in mind and uses a camera indicator light that glows green when the camera is active. So you will always know when the camera is on. The camera is engineered so that it can\u2019t activate without the camera indicator light also turning on.\u201d\nFurthermore, Apple observes that covering the camera may prevent some of the laptop\u2019s features from working as well, such as automatic brightness adjustment (via the ambient light sensor) and True Tone technology.\nIf you must use a webcam cover, Apple advises that it shouldn\u2019t be thicker than a piece of printer paper (0.1mm), or if you do use a thicker cover, make sure that you remove it before closing the MacBook. Otherwise, you may run the risk of cracking the display. You also shouldn\u2019t use anything that leaves an adhesive residue on your camera, for obvious reasons.\n- Check out the best laptops\nDarren is a freelancer writing news and features for TechRadar (and occasionally T3) across a broad range of computing topics including CPUs, GPUs, various other hardware, VPNs, antivirus and more.

      "text": "Apple\nApple is arguably the world's most important consumer tech company, having played a hugely influential role in shaping the smartphone, laptop, desktop computer, tablet, and wearable markets.\nIt continues to dominate many of those areas today through the iPhone 14, iPad, MacBook Air and Pro, iMac, and Apple Watch product lines, and with new forays into the likes of AV/VR to come. Its decision to build its own silicon, meanwhile, has given it an advantage over rivals such as Samsung and Microsoft - one that's only slowly being closed.\nIt's been every bit as dominant in the software space through iOS, macOS, watchOS, iTunes, Apple Pay, and more, while its Apple TV Plus streaming service is now regularly home to top-quality, award-winning original content.\nApple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in 1976, and has been led by CEO Tim Cook since 2011.

      "text": "Want a MacBook for college but shopping on a student budget? I found a secret weapon for saving cash\nForget Apple\u2019s education store\nBuying one of the best student laptops isn\u2019t always easy, especially if you\u2019re eyeing up one of Apple\u2019s MacBooks and are working to a tight budget. MacBooks are some of the most expensive laptops out there, and while they\u2019re packed with features and practically last forever, your finances can still take a hit.\nApple offers student discounts across its range of products, yet these aren\u2019t the most generous offers you\u2019ll see. But what if I told you there\u2019s another way to get a cheap MacBook without compromising on quality or buying from a dodgy third-party website? In fact, you can score a top-quality MacBook directly from Apple while saving hundreds in the process.\nI can vouch for this method, too, as I\u2019ve done it myself and am still pleased with what I got years later. Try it out yourself, and you\u2019ll get an excellent new Mac for college without breaking the bank.\nApple\u2019s education store\nThe most conventional way to get one of the best MacBooks for college is to use Apple\u2019s education website. This houses various deals for students on devices like Macs and iPads, and Apple often throws in free extras (like a pair of AirPods or an Apple Pencil) when you buy through this store.\nThe problem is that the deals you\u2019ll find there aren\u2019t always that attractive. Most Macs only come with $100 off \u2013 the MacBook Air is priced at $899 through Apple\u2019s education storefront, as opposed to its regular $999 price, for example. A 10% discount is fine, but not earth-shattering.\nIf you\u2019re in the market for an Apple device and were planning on buying one of the accessories that the company bundles in for free anyway, it\u2019s worth a look. For instance, if you were going to get a MacBook and a new Magic Mouse, you can get the latter for free from Apple, which is a great deal. But these offers don\u2019t last forever, and if you can\u2019t get one \u2013 or would rather save even more money on a laptop than have an accessory you don\u2019t need \u2013 there\u2019s another place you should be looking.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, any saving is welcome, and you\u2019d do far worse than to accept the $100 off that Apple\u2019s education store provides. But I know we can do better than that.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe refurbished alternative\nEnter Apple's Certified Refurbished store. There, you\u2019ll find a whole host of Apple products that have been returned by previous customers, fitted up and repaired by Apple, then sold on at a steep discount.\nI know what you\u2019re thinking: why would you buy a refurbished product when you can get a brand-new one from Apple? Aren\u2019t refurbished ones full of dents, scuffs, and other problems?\nThat might be the case when you buy from third-party refurbished stores, but not from Apple. Apple\u2019s refurbishment process is rigorous: the company cleans, tests, and inspects each device, replaces any faulty parts with genuine replacement components, and ships it to you for free in a new box with new cables and accessories. You get a one-year warranty, too, with the option to insure your device with AppleCare.\nI bought a MacBook Pro with the M1 Pro chip from Apple\u2019s refurbished store a few years ago. When it arrived, I simply wouldn\u2019t have believed that it wasn\u2019t a new laptop: from the new, sealed box to the spotless body without a scratch on it, nothing indicated that this was anything other than a brand-new product.\nDiscounts on discounts\nWith the refurbished route, the real kicker is the price. While Apple\u2019s education store is selling the entry-level M4 MacBook Air for $899, you can get the same device on the refurbished store for the even lower price of $849. Saving even more money for something that is essentially indistinguishable from a new MacBook seems like a no-brainer.\nSure, you might be able to find a Mac even cheaper by scouring eBay or Facebook Marketplace, but you won\u2019t get anywhere near the same quality, and certainly not the same warranty.\nThe only caveat with the refurbished store is that some websites discount new Macs to similar prices to what Apple offers, so it\u2019s often worth checking major retailers from time to time to see how they match up. If you can get a brand-new MacBook for less than one of Apple\u2019s refurbished ones, that\u2019s naturally the better option.\nBut if you just need something right now and want to score a discount without having to sacrifice your peace of mind, Apple\u2019s refurbished store is a great place to look. It could leave you with a top-quality laptop for college and a little more change in your pocket, too.\nYou might also like\n- The best student laptops in 2025: top tested picks for college and school\n- Don\u2019t want to pay full price for a cutting-edge MacBook Pro or Mac mini?

      "text": "It\u2019s 2025 and Apple has still not fixed this ancient Mac bug \u2013 but here\u2019s a solution\nFixing audio balance drift on my Mac took me on a journey\nI\u2019ve been having this recurring problem with my MacBook Pro for ages now. Every so often the sound in my headphones will inexplicably stop playing from the left speaker.\nAt first I thought it was a problem with my bluetooth headphones. One of the speakers can, after all, just break for no good reason, so I switched to a wired pair, but after a few days the same problem started happening again.\nI thought I was simply unlucky to get the same physical failure twice, and I was about to shell out for another pair of the best headphones when a thought struck me: lightning doesn't usually strike twice in tech problems.\nHang on, I thought, what if the problem wasn\u2019t the headphones? What if the problem was my Mac?\nOn a quest\nOn a mission to track down the source of the issue I fired up System Preferences, hit Sound and I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing. In the Output tab the Balance slider had inexplicably shifted to the right.\nThis was odd because it wasn\u2019t something I ever remember changing. I put it back in the centre, and reached for my original headset (which was on the way to being thrown out with the small electronic recycling), popped them on my head and hit play on Sleep Token\u2019s incredible new album Even in Arcadia. Damn! There was absolutely nothing wrong with the headphones at all; both speakers were functioning perfectly.\nI put this all down to it being my fault - human error. In my frantic keyboard tapping as I wrote articles for TechRadar I must have hit some sort of weird key combination that triggered a balance shift in audio output.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nI laughed at how stupid I was for buying new headphones and thought, well at least I\u2019ve got a backup pair now.\nLife continued as normal for a couple of days until it happened again. I reset the balance to the centre point but an hour later, it happened again. At this point I realized that it wasn\u2019t me that was doing it and something spooky was going on.\nEither my Mac was haunted by a ghost who was deaf in one ear, or this must be happening to other people too. I searched Google for the problem, and I was surprised by what I found.\nA decades old problem\nIf you search for \u201cBalance drift\u201d and \u201cMac\u201d, you\u2019ll find references to the audio balance drift problem going back years. In fact, I found them going back over ten years.\nYou\u2019ll find references to the problem strewn across the internet like graffiti left on a wall by post-apocalyptic survivors: \u201cThe year is 2024 and Apple still has not fixed the audio left/right balance bug in MacOS\u201d, or from 3 years ago, \u201cI went into Apple the other day because I figured my one AirPod just broke. They told me the only solution was to buy new AirPods. Glad I found out about the balance issue!\u201d, or from 5 years ago: \u201cWhy Apple hasn't fixed this is beyond me.\u201d\nThe truth is that we\u2019re in the second decade of the balance drift problem and Apple still has not done anything about it. I was stunned.\nThis issue seems to be caused by Bluetooth headphones in macOS, however I also experienced it with a pair of wired cans myself. The exact version of macOS you\u2019re running doesn\u2019t seem to matter either, and not everybody experiences the problem.\nIt feels like pinning down the exact cause of the drift would be a challenge for even the finest of TV\u2019s fictional detectives, but the good news is that there is a simple solution if you find that you are affected.\nThe solution\nYou can stop balance drift happening by installing the Balance Lock app from Tunabelly Software Inc.\nThe description for the app reads: \u201cNoticing that the audio balance for your headphones is going slightly to the left or right? Balance Lock was designed to solve this by keeping the audio centred either in the middle or to a custom lock point. No more annoying left/right audio drift!\u201d\nFrankly, I\u2019m amazed that Apple hasn\u2019t fixed this widespread problem yet, despite apps designed to fix it being available on its own App Store. If you\u2019re experiencing the balance drift problem, don\u2019t bin your headphones like I did, simply install this app and the problem will disappear.\nThe Balance Lock app is available for free on the Mac App store.\nYou may also like\nGraham is the Senior Editor for AI at TechRadar.

Owners of the all-in-one device have complained of phantom horizontal lines appearing on their screens. First reports of the issue date as far back as mid-2023, and Apple is yet to acknowledge the issue. What\u2019s worse, the apparent design flaw tends to show up after two years of use, meaning most affected devices are already out of warranty.\nA lengthy (17-page) discussion thread on Apple\u2019s community forums is filled with user reports of this iMac display failure. Many users reported contacting Apple service centers only to be told that they must replace the screens entirely \u2013 not a desirable thought, considering those cost between $600 and $700, a price you could buy a brand-new Mac mini for.\nOne user, not happy with the diagnosis, took their iMac to an independent repair shop. The technician found that the problem stems from the flex cable used in the displays. At maximum screen brightness, the cable has to carry up to 50 volts, and over time this causes the connector to burn out, which in turn leads to the circuit shorting and the horizontal lines appearing.\nThe blame game\nApple has yet to issue an official statement, which has led some to believe that even if the screens were to be replaced the issue would recur. We reached out to Apple for a direct comment, but have not yet received a response - we'll update this article if we receive a statement from the company.\nIt\u2019s not unheard of for Apple to issue free repairs or even replacements when widespread defects are confirmed with their devices. In June 2018 it launched a program that offered free repairs or replacements for its MacBook Pro Butterfly Keyboard, which had received widespread complaints of double-typing, sticky keys, and keys not registering.\nAccording to Apple\u2019s warranty documentation, customers with expired warranty plans and who are not covered by AppleCare+ are responsible for any defects that arise after the warranty period.\nSeeing as it looks like the fault lies with Apple\u2019s manufacturing process, they may be forced to offer free repairs or recall the devices altogether. It\u2019s certainly something that Apple must look into, because the issue could affect newer models like its M3 iMac, or even the upcoming M4 iMac. For now, customers remain desperate for a resolution to the issue.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nYou might also like...\n- New update says M4 chip-based MacBook Pro, iMac, and redesigned Mac mini will launch in 2024 - with an October reveal looking likely\n- Apple\u2019s M4 Macs could launch ahead of Black Friday \u2013 and cheapest models might finally come with 16GB RAM\n- Apple just declared a bunch of Macs obsolete \u2013 these are the affected MacBook and iMac models\nRosario Blue is a writer, playwright, and freelance journalist.\nShe is a Global Goodwill Ambassador for Postcards for Peace."

We found performance across the board to be exceptional, whether you're using it for running office apps or video editing. Like most MBPs, it's also available in 14-inch and 16-inch models, and the display remains one of the best you can get on any laptop, period.\nBut in general, if you just need a decent all-rounder, you can't really go wrong with any M-series MacBook Pro (avoid the MacBook Pro Intel laptops, though). Even the older M1 chips are great for productivity and creative workloads.\nIn this round-up, I've included some of the best MacBook and Macs, the best business Mac and MacBook, and best video editing Mac and MacBook that we've reviewed. As part of our testing process, we've benchmarked performance, timed batter lift, and explored the full capabilities of Apple's premiere laptop.\nQuick List\nBest overall\nThe best MacBook Pro overall\nThe MacBook Pro 14-inch with the latest M4-series chips offers outstanding, best-in-class performance while getting fantastic battery life and features the best display of any MacBook ever.\nBest on a budget\nThe best MacBook Pro on a budget\nWith the release of the M4-powered MBP, I'm seeing some great deals on the previous M3 models, and it's still an incredible workstation for Apple fans.\nBest for creators\nThe best MacBook Pro for creators\nPerfect for creative professionals, the MacBook Pro 16-inch with the M4 Pro and M4 Max chips is Apple's most powerful laptop on the market. Expect staggering performance.\nBest M3\nThe best MacBook Pro with M3 chip\nLooking for an M3-powered MacBook Pro? This one comes equipped with the exceptional M3 Pro or M3 Max chip, delivering incredible performance - and that gorgeous display, too.\nBest M2\nThe best MacBook Pro with M2 chip\nThe early-2023 MacBook Pro 14-inch isn't as powerful as the M3-series models released later that same year, but it's still a fantastic performer that you'll likely find on sale.\nBest entry-level\nThe best entry-level MacBook Pro\nThe MacBook Pro 14-inch with M1 Pro might be harder to find than newer models, but if you can find this powerhouse on clearance, it'll be well worth the effort.\nThe best MacBook Pro overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe new MacBook Pro 14in, powered by Apple's M4 chip, particularly the high-end M4 Max processor, is more than just a new laptop; it's a testament to the chip's raw power. The highest-end configurations showcase superior performance due to their additional CPU and GPU cores and large memory capacity (128GB). While the base M4 model still offers advanced features like hardware-based ray tracing, mesh shading, and a fast neural network, it has fewer cores and less memory.\nThis MacBook Pro stands out for its design, including an option for a fingerprint-resistant Space Black finish, a highly praised keyboard, and the macOS Sequoia platform, offering versatility for various activities. It's considered the best MacBook to date.\nIn our experience, the complete MacBook Pro M4 series, from the base model to the M4 Pro and M4 Max, rank among the top laptops available, not just the best MacBook Pro devices, with the M4 Max configuration also a contender for the best gaming laptop list and the best portable workstation due to it's raw power and ability.\nI've opted for the 14-inch version here, as I feel it nicely balances price and performance, but there is a 16-inch model for those who want the larger screen and more configuration options.\nRead our full MacBook Pro 14-inch (M4) review\nThe best MacBook Pro on a budget\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFor a cheap MacBook Pro with a modern performance, you can pick up a last-gen model with the M3 processor for a reasonable price. It's not as powerful as the newer (and more expensive) M4 versions, but for everything from office work to video editing, the MacBook Pro 14-inch M3 is still a mighty laptop.\nLike any MacBook Pro, this laptop excels at graphically-intensive work. However, we found it was also very capable at gaming. In common with modern MacBooks, it also boasts one of the best screens on a laptop, with the Liquid Retina Display featuring wide color gamut, True Tone technology, and ProMotion technology providing a 120Hz refresh rate.\nFor an even cheaper MacBook Pro, the M1 and M2 models are still very much worth exploring, however, I'm finding them harder to buy these days unless they're refurbed. These older machines may lack the power of the newer models, but performance is still excellent overall. For a cheap non-Pro version, see our MacBook Air M4 review, a top pick at an excellent price if your needs are more simple.\nRead our full MacBook Pro 14-inch (M3 Max) review\nThe best MacBook Pro for creators\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe MacBook Pro 16, powered by Apple\u2019s M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, takes high-performance laptops to the next level. If you opt for the M4 Max configuration, you\u2019re getting unmatched power - featuring advanced CPU and GPU cores and up to 128GB of unified memory. It\u2019s purpose-built to handle anything you throw at it, from 3D rendering and massive simulations to high-end video editing projects. If you're a creative professional, it's the one to choose.\nThe 16-inch Liquid Retina XDR display is an absolute showstopper. It\u2019s the biggest and brightest display in Apple\u2019s line-up, delivering stunning color accuracy, 1,600 nits of peak brightness, and buttery-smooth ProMotion technology. Whether you\u2019re a creative pro or a multitasking powerhouse, the screen\u2019s spacious layout gives you the room to focus and create like never before.\nAnd let\u2019s talk about the Space Black finish. It\u2019s as stylish as it is functional. Thanks to the fingerprint-resistant anodized coating, it stays clean and sleek no matter how much you use it. If you\u2019re after ultimate performance, versatility, and a laptop that can keep up with your creativity, this is the one to beat.\nSure, the MacBook Pro 16-inch (M4 Pro/Max) doesn\u2019t come cheap, but it\u2019s built for those who demand the best. For a slightly cheaper alternative, the M3 Max model is also worth considering, and scores very high in the performance stakes.\nRead the full Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M4 Pro) review\nThe best MacBook Pro M3\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOnce the top-end MacBook Pro, the M3 Max-powered model is still incredibly impressive machine and if you're looking for pure power for slightly less than the M4 Max models, we can't recommend this one enough.\nThe MacBook Pro 16-inch (M3) boasts an exceptional 16.2-inch display with Liquid Retina XDR technology, 1,600 nits peak brightness, and 120Hz ProMotion tech, ensuring a vivid and responsive visual experience. It also features a range of ports for enhanced connectivity.\nThe MacBook Pro is a powerhouse in performance. During our review process, this MBP laptop effortlessly handled intensive tasks like editing 4K footage, and in a major shift, even proved capable of running the latest games. Compared to the M1 Max, our own benchmark tests showed a 35% increase in Geekbench 6 in single core CPU performance, and an increase of 69% in multi-core performance. We also ran our standard battery life test, where the laptop shone, delivering more than 24 hours of life on a single charge. Now that's impressive (although it lasted less when gaming compared to less intensive tasks.\nThe MacBook Pro M3 Max is, admittedly, an expensive device, and not everyone will require the sort of power and performance on offer here. But for those that do, this one gets a strong recommendation.\nRead our full Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M3 Max) review\nThe best MacBook Pro M2\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nPowered by the impressive M2 Pro and M2 Max processor, we found this Apple MacBook Pro to provide blistering speeds and buttery smooth running of everything from productivity and office apps to video and photo editing software. Yes, the design is effectively identical to its predecessor, but that bump in specs is noticeable.\nAs usual, build quality is excellent here. It feels robust and durable in hand, and it's a real pleasure using the keyboard and trackpad, too. However, the truly eye-catching thing about this laptop - and, indeed, all the best MacBook Pro devices - is that screen. With its 3024 x 1964 resolution, Liquid Retina XDR display and mini-LED technology, the results are stunning, and during our review, we found it capably delivers vibrant colors and a rich, deep contrast. Elsewhere on the machine, you'll find a fair amount of ports. The selection, which includes three Thunderbolt 4 ports and a HDMI port, should satisfy most users without restriction.\nPerformance-wise, the M2 Pro easily handles heavy workloads - and few will need the absolute power of the M2 Max, although the option is nice to have for, say, professional video editing at high resolutions.\nRead our full Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M2 Pro) review\nThe best entry-level MacBook Pro\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe MacBook Pro 14-inch powered by the original M1 chip is still an impressive beast, despite being three model generations behind the current line-up. Even today, it's a stand-out MBP for creative professionals editing images, videos, and running office apps.\nThis model remains a compelling device, especially for those who may find it on clearance. If you can get one powered by Apple's M1 Pro or M1 Max chips, you'll find - as we did - that it outperforms the base Apple M2 processor. The device features a comprehensive array of ports, addressing a common grievance among users of previous generations by eliminating the dependency on dongles and hubs for peripheral connections.\nWith three Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI, SDXC card slot, and MagSafe 3 for charging, it caters adeptly to the needs of professionals requiring a robust mobile workstation for a more modest investment than newer models demand.\nThis MacBook Pro not only boasts superior internal hardware but also introduces an upgraded Liquid Retina XDR display with mini-LED technology, akin to that in the latest iPad Pro, offering an impressive 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio and ProMotion technology for refresh rates up to 120Hz. This ensures stunning visual quality, whether for editing HDR content, scrolling through websites, or engaging in any task that benefits from vibrant colors and fluid motion.\nAdditionally, when we ran our tests, we found battery life extends to 17 hours, a notable feat for a mobile workstation of this caliber, allowing it to maintain performance without throttling to conserve power. Despite its premium pricing at launch, the MacBook Pro 14-inch (M1) remains an unrivaled option for professionals needing exceptional performance and functionality. Its blend of power, design, and utility makes it an excellent investment, particularly if available at a reduced price, underscoring its status as not just an older model, but a timeless piece of technology offering outstanding value.\nRead our full Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M1) review\nBest MacBook Pro laptops: Compared\nModel | CPU | GPU | RAM | Screen | Storage | Dimensions |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M4) | Apple M4 \u2013 M4 Max | Integrated GPU | Up to 128GB | 14-inch Liquid Retina XDR display | Up to 8TB | 12.31 x 8.71 x 1.55 in / 31.26 x 22.12 x 1.55 cm |\nApple MacBook Pro 13-inch (M2) | Apple M2 with 8-core CPU | Integrated 10-core GPU | Up to 24GB | 13.3-inch display, 2560 x 1600 | Up to 2TB | 11.97 x 8.36 x 0.61 in / 30.41 x 21.24 x 1.56 cm |\nApple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M4 Pro) | Apple M3 Pro \u2013 M3 Max | Integrated GPU | Up to 128GB | 16.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display, 3456 x 2234 | Up to 8TB | 14.01 x 9.77 x .66 in / 35.57 x 24.81 x 1.68 cm |\nApple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M3 Max) | Apple M3 Pro \u2013 M3 Max | Integrated GPU | Up to 128GB | 16.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display, 3456 x 2234 | Up to 8TB | 14.01 x 9.77 x .66 in / 35.57 x 24.81 x 1.68 cm |\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M2 Pro) | Apple M2 Pro (10-core) - Apple M2 Max (12-core) | Up to 38-core GPU | Up to 96GB | 14-inch Liquid Retina XDR display | Up to 8TB | 12.31 x 8.71 x 1.55 in / 31.26 x 22.12 x 1.55 cm |\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M1) | Apple M1 Pro - Apple M1 Max | Up to 32-core GPU | Up to 64GB | 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display, 3024 x 1964 | Up to 8TB | 0.61 x 12.31 x 8.71 inches / 1.55 x 31.26 x 22.12 cm |\nThe best MacBook Pro: FAQs\nMacBook Pro versus MacBook Air: which is better?\nWhile the MacBook Air is a fantastic and ultra-portable laptop at a great price, it is not really geared for the highest level of creative professionals, so it might not have the memory, storage, and processing power you'll need for the top end creative workflows.\nIf you need to do serious creative content work, or if you need a machine that will stand the test of time and you're willing to invest a bit more than a MacBook Air, the MacBook Pro is the way to go. If this is the case, pair with the best monitors for MacBook Pro for the absolute in color fidelity, expanding your digital workspace to an even larger display.\nIs the MacBook Pro good for gaming?\nIt really depends on the laptop model and the type of games you want to play. You're unlikely to get the same level of performance at max settings on most of the best MacBook Pro compared to the best gaming laptops.\nSaying that, though, using a MacBook Pro laptop for gaming has come on leaps and bounds, and is set to only get even better.\nOur News Editor Jacob tried playing Cyberpunk 2077 on a MacBook Pro 16-inch with the M4 Max. You can check out what he discovered by clicking here, but essentially, performance proved excellent.\nHe said: \"It was on \u2018Ultra\u2019 settings with a buttery smooth and excellently rendered 120 frames per second. And yes, this performance is derived from Apple\u2019s M4 Max chip \u2013 no discrete GPU required. Further, this was fully taking advantage of Apple's Metal 4, coming later this year, including MetalFX Frame Interpolation. It looked fantastic and was responsive.\"\nHow long does a MacBook Pro last?\nIn short, it should last years and years. They are expensive, but I tend to think of them as being investment laptops.\nCouple the specs with a robust and well-built chassis and you're looking at a long-lasting machine.\nI still recommend M1-powered MacBook Pro laptops, which came out at the tail-end of 2020, because while they're not the latest and greatest, performance remains exceptional.\nWhich MacBook Pro processor is best?\nThis isn't as straightforward a question as it might seem, honestly. The MacBook Pro 14-inch with an M4-series chip is our top pick, but an M2 Max MacBook Pro is going to outperform an M3 or M3 Pro chip, even though these were released more recently. It all depends on your performance needs and your budget, since older models might be cheaper than current models while still giving you the level of performance you need.\nIt's truly up to you and your needs, budget, and current deals going on. The MacBook Pro notoriously runs for quite some time, so don't feel like just because a new model dropped that your previous generation is going to bite the dust anytime soon.\nShould I get a MacBook Pro with an Intel chip?\nI wouldn't recommend it. While they're a lot cheaper, they're also far slower (and older). If you're going for an Intel processor, opt for a Windows laptop instead.\nIt really wasn't until the launch of the Apple Silicon system-on-chip that MacBooks really showed off what they're truly capable of - we've loved every M-series MacBook Pro we've tested when it comes to performance.\nHow to choose the best MacBook Pro for you\nThe two key factors to keep in mind when choosing a MacBook Pro is price and performance, since the designs and displays of each MacBook Pro on our list are similar enough that you won't find much difference there. Only slight differences in design, port offering, transfer speeds and specs.\nOlder models will be cheaper, as will smaller sizes, so if you're on a more restricted budget, the M2-series MacBook Pros in 13-inch and 14-inch are great, and you can get up to an M2 Max in a 15-inch MacBook Pro. If you've got a lot of room in your budget, a 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Max is going to be the best you can get and will last you much longer than other models might, which is great for future-proofing, however it is also going to be the most expensive, by far.\nFor memory and storage, unless you're doing substantial video editing work with very large source files at high resolutions, you shouldn't need more than 24GB or 32GB of memory, and 1TB storage is going to be more than enough for most users. Video pros will definitely need a minimum of 32GB and 2TB, and higher memory and storage configurations are recommended.\nIf you do a lot of cloud-based work, or don't work with heavy files, you can get away with smaller storage sizes, or you can use some of the best external hard drives for Mac expanding your storage for cheaper than you may find internal storage to be.\nAt the end of the day, decide what is priority, be it the processor, storage, ports, or screen, and then look for the right combination based on that. For most, any MacBook Pro is more than enough, so pay attention to what is needed, and go from there.\nFor more laptop peripherals, see our reviews of the best MacBook Pro accessories.\nHow we test the best MacBook Pro laptops\n\u2705 More than 1,800 laptops, Chromebooks, and MacBooks reviewed\n\u2705 15 years of product testing\n\u2705 Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\n\u2705 Nearly 200,000 hours testing tech\nWe put all the MacBook Pro models we review through our standard battery of benchmark tests to score their processing power, both in absolute synthetic terms but also with workloads like video editing, 3D rendering, and others.\nTraditionally, MacBooks are some of the best laptops for photo editing, best video editing laptops, and best laptops for graphic design - so we're always keen to see how the latest models perform in the creative arena. We also conduct extensive battery testing to measure its real world longevity.\nWe measure these scores against their predecessors to determine if it's worth the upgrade to the latest models, or if the previous model offers a better value of price for its performance.\nFor more computing essentials, we reviewed the best monitors for the Mac mini\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nSteve is B2B Editor for Creative & Hardware at TechRadar Pro.

Since joining TechRadar in 2014, he's reviewed over 250 laptops and computing accessories, many of which are Macs and MacBooks, as well as competitor devices from the likes of Microsoft, HP and Lenovo.\nThe best MacBooks and Macs 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nWe've tested every MacBook, iMac, and Mac mini under the sun to bring you the best of the best. Whether you're after a budget-buy entry to the world of Apple computing or you're upgrading to the latest hardware and want to know where the best bang for your buck is, you've landed on the right list. These are our picks for the best Macs you can buy.\nThe best MacBook overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the best ultraportable MacBook: On the outside, the latest 13-inch MacBook Air looks like previous models, but the M4 chip upgrade and lower price makes it a winner.\n\u2705 You're after a thin and light laptop: At 0.44 inches / 1.13cm thick and just 2.7lbs /1.24kg, the new 13-inch Air is perfect for traveling with.\n\u274c You want a touchscreen: Apple has been on record saying it won't make a touchscreen MacBook, so you might need to go for an iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard, or switch to Windows 11.\n\u274c You're excited about AI: While competitors like Microsoft and Google are storming ahead with adding AI to its products, Apple Intelligence has yet to properly take off.\nApple launched a brand-new MacBook Air in 2025, which is now powered by its latest and greatest chip, the M4, and it has once again produced not only the best MacBook you can buy right now, but also the best laptop in the world.\nOn the outside, it might seem like Apple has played it safe with the MacBook Air 13-inch (M4), as it keeps the same design as the previous two iterations. However, we're not complaining - this is one of the best-looking laptops around, and at just 2.7lbs / 1.24kg, and with dimensions of 11.97 x 8.46 x 0.44 inches / 30.41 x 21.5 x 1.13cm, I love how easy this - and previous MacBook Airs - is to place this in a backpack and easily carry it around whereever I go.\nThe backlit keyboard feels fantastic to type on, and the glass-covered multi-touch trackpad is comfortable to use, and makes working in macOS a pleasure. Screen-wise, the MacBook Air 13-inch (M4) comes with the same excellent 13.6-inch Liquid Retina panel with 2560 x 1664 resolution and 500 nits of sustained brightness as last year's model, though the once-controversial notch now contains the upgraded 12MP Center Stage Camera webcam, which we found makes video calls look even better, and allows for some cool effects, such as keeping you in frame as you move around the room (as long as you don't stray too far).\nHowever, inside the MacBook Air (M4), there's been some major changes, mainly thanks to Apple's latest chip. The M4 now supports up to 32GB of unified memory, with the base model of the MacBook Air (M4) starting at 16GB (previous models came with just 8GB), and we found it was particularly great at multi-tasking with multiple apps open at once (during our review we had Garage Band running for making music, while editing images and videos in Pixelmator Pro). We even played the AAA game Lies of Pi at maximum settings and it was smooth as butter, thanks no doubt in part to the new Game Mode in macOS that optimizes performance for gaming. Playing that game while also running Final Cut Pro to edit four 4K 30fps streams at once proved just how good the MacBook Air 13-inch (M4) is at keeping up with demanding tasks - which is especially impressive considering the new, lower, launch price of $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,699.\nRead our in-depth MacBook Air 13-inch (M4) review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice | The MacBook Air 13-inch (M4) offers very good value for money with a new, lower, starting price | 4.5/5 |\nDesign | Still an excellent build and design, and the Sky Blue color is splendid. | 4.5/5 |\nDisplay and Center Stage | Beautiful Liquid Retina Display, and the Center Stage camera upgrade is a welcome one. | 4.5/5 |\nmacOS and Apple Intelligence | Excellent platform, but Apple Intelligence is not yet making it a must-buy | 4/5 |\nPerformance | The M4 raises the bar on performance to keep pace with and sometimes surpass the Qualcomm competition. | 4.5/5 |\nBattery life | 18 hours is possible if you only watch video, but an eight-hour day of hard work is still impressive | 5/5 |\nThe best budget MacBook\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want an ultra-portable MacBook that's affordable: The MacBook Air M3 has had its price cut since the M4 model released, making this a brilliant thin and light laptop that isn't outrageously expensive and will cope with almost any task you throw at it.\n\u2705 You don't need extreme power: The MacBook Air 13-inch (M3) offers brilliant performance, so if you don't need a MacBook Pro for heavy creative tasks (and aren't bothered about the newer M4 chip), the Air is a great alternative.\n\u274c You want the latest hardware: The M3 chip in this MacBook Air remains a great performer, but it's not the most recent chip. The MacBook Air with the newer M4 chip is the one to get if you want cutting-edge Apple silicon.\n\u274c You want a big screen: The 13.6-inch screen makes the MacBook Air a great portable device, but some people may prefer the 15-inch model for working on.\nApple\u2019s previous MacBook Air model, which launched in 2024, comes with the M3 chip, bringing this nicely portable 13-inch laptop even closer to the level of performance you might expect from the MacBook Pro range. While the latter remains the choice for power users and content creators, the MacBook Air (M3) closes the gap more than ever, and now that the newer MacBook Air (M4) has been released, the price of the M3 model has dropped as retailers aim to clear stock.\nOne important thing to note is that Apple has stopped selling the MacBook Air (M3) itself, but other retailers such as Amazon and Walmart are continuing to sell it at a reduced price. When big shopping events like Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday come around, the MacBook Air (M3) could get further price cuts, making this by far the best budget MacBook you can buy.\nThe MacBook Air (M3) remains a top-notch performer for everyday computing, and impressive for more demanding tasks like content creation \u2013 or even dabbling in playing some games. While reviewing it, I found that it provides a great multi-tasking experience. I ran a variety of apps, including Safari, Garage Band, and Apple TV at once without any noticable slowdown, and thanks to its fanless design, the MacBook Air (M3) is almost completely silent when in use. I also ran more demanding software, such as Adobe Photoshop and Ableton Live 12, on the MacBook Air (M3) and, again, I was very impressed with how well this MacBook performed, with apps opening quickly and reliably.\nBoasting plenty of battery life \u2013 14 hours on a single charge in our tests \u2013 and a new lower price point, the M3-toting version of the MacBook Air pushes this device to fresh heights, and is an excellent buy overall.\nRead our in-depth MacBook Air (M3) review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice | The MacBook Air 13-inch (M3) offers very good value for money with a new, lower, starting price | 4.5/5 |\nDesign | No new design, but if it's not broken, why fix it? | 4.5/5 |\nPerformance | The M3 chip proves to be an excellent, if not particularly revolutionary, upgrade over the M2 | 4.5/5 |\nBattery life | You'll easily get through a whole work day on a single charge | 5/5 |\nThe best Mac\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want an affordable Mac: This is the cheapest way to get into the Mac ecosystem, and it's worth every cent thanks to excellent performance and a gorgeous design.\n\u2705 You're looking for a mini PC: Put simply, if you want a small form factor desktop PC, this is the one to get. No Windows 11 mini PC can come close.\n\u274c You want a gaming PC: There's a growing library of Mac-compatible games out there, but if you want to play AAA titles with graphical settings whacked up to max, a gaming PC (or gaming laptop) remains a better buy.\n\u274c You like to tinker and upgrade your PCs: Apple has never seemed keen on letting its users open up and upgrade their devices, but due to the compact size of the mac Mini (M4), it's even harder.\nIf you're on the hunt for a powerful Apple computer that will get the job done with that Mac flair but without breaking the bank, then you're after the Mac mini, especially now that it comes with an even smaller design, plus new and improved M4 hardware inside.\nApple also finally put the lowest RAM config at 16GB, which is more necessary than ever with memory-hungry apps like Chrome happily gobbling up resources.\nThe model I reviewed is the Mac mini with M4 chip, 16GB of unified memory, and a 512GB SSD. For day-to-day tasks, where I used the Mac mini for writing the review, browsing the web and general admin, it worked brilliantly. The operating system \u2013 macOS Sequoia \u2013 booted quickly, and every app I used loaded speedily and ran smoothly.\nI also used Premier Pro for editing videos in 4K, and the Mac mini didn't miss a beat - which is particularly impressive considering its tiny size (and low price point). I also played Shadow of the Tomb Raider on the Mac mini (M4), and at high graphics settings it hit a very good 44fps (frames per second). While I wouldn't say the Mac mini (M4) is a gaming PC, for dabbling in games it does an impressive job (and remains completely silent), and thanks to its lounge-friendly compact design, it could be the closest we come to getting an Apple games console.\nIn the downside department, you may not love the fact that there's no USB-A port - but you can always supplement with one of our picks for the best USB-C hubs.\nIt's smaller, it's faster, it's better. For an affordable foot in the Apple-ecosystem door, choose the Mac mini (M4) simply can't be beat.\nRead the in-depth Apple Mac mini (M4) review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | The new Mac mini once again offers phenomenal value for money | 5 / 5 |\nDesign | The new design is fantastic, with a smaller footprint and additional ports. Just a shame about the placement of the power button | 4.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Simply amazing performance for a mini PC at this price, though it struggles with modern games a bit | 4.5 / 5 |\nThe Best MacBook for Content Creators\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a powerful yet portable workstation laptop: The MacBook Pro 14-inch comes with Apple's latest and most powerful M4 chips, offering brilliant performance in a compact laptop.\n\u2705 You want all-day battery: Despite its powerful components, the MacBook Pro 14-inch is very efficient and that means its battery can last almost all day - in our tests it hit 18 hours on a single charge.\n\u274c You want a touchscreen: Some creatives like the intuitiveness of a touchscreen for some tasks, and if that's you then I'm afraid you'll be disappointed with the 14-inch MacBook Pro, which, like other MacBooks, doesn't feature one.\n\u274c You have an M2 or M3 MacBook Pro: There's no denying that the new M4 chip is seriously powerful, but there's not a big enough gap between it and the two previous generations to justify buying a new MacBook.\nThe MacBook Pro line has earned a reputation as excellent laptops for creative work over the years, and there are very good reasons why. They always offer a sleek, well-built machine with capable hardware and the Apple touch that just can't be replicated.\nSo when Apple unveiled the latest MacBook Pro, you already know we had to put it through its paces and see if the lineup is still worthy of its presumed prowess.\nIt is.\nPerhaps the most important aspect of the MacBook pro for creatives, the display, is an absolute homerun. Its 14-inch, 120Hz, mini-LED screen is the perfect canvas for graphic design and media enjoyment, and the Apple M4 silicone packed under the MacBook's hood is a match made in heaven.\nAnd good news if you enjoy the pastime: the M4 MacBook Pro can even handle AAA games. I know - gaming on a Mac? The M4 chip says \"yes.\" Our tests found an average of 42-62fps in Lies of P.\nOf course, we didn't just play games while testing the MacBook Pro 14-inch (M4) - we put it through its paces in FinalCut Pro, editing four 4K 30fps streams at once, where playback was extremely smooth. However, footage from an iPhone 16 Pro Max recorded at 4K and 120fps did stress the base M4 chip when we tried editing four streams at once. If you're going to be doing that kind of intensive creative work, then I recommend going for the MacBook Pro 14-inch model with either the M4 Pro or M4 Max chips.\nIt's got the design, the display, and the performance - the only kicker here is the price (the other thing MacBooks are known for). It's expensive, but you definitely get what you pay for.\nRead our in-depth Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M4) review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Good price for more memory and a faster CPU | 4/5 |\nDesign | Virtually the same design as the previous model. All the key ports. Fantastic screen | 5/5 |\nPerformance | M4 has the Pro power most need, macOS Sequoia is flexible and easy to use, AAA gaming on a Mac is real | 5/5 |\nBattery life | Rated for 24-hour video streaming, Lasted more than 18 hours in our tests, Battery life is dependent on activity | 4.5/5 |\nDispaly | Gorgeous, Better brightness for SDR, The coating you want | 4.5/5 |\nThe Best iMac\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the best all-in-one PC: Like the latest M4 Mac mini, the iMac (M4) isn't just one of the best Macs ever made, it's also a leader in its product class. No other all-in-one PC comes close.\n\u2705 You want a sleek, yet colorful, desktop computer: The iMac (M4) is incredibly thin, while still offering excellent performance. It will look good on pretty much any desk, and there's some great new color choices as well.\n\u274c You the most powerful Mac: The latest iMac only comes with the M4 chip, which is undoubtedly powerful, but doesn't reach the performance highs of the M4 Pro and M4 Max found in some of the best MacBooks and Macs.\n\u274c You want a big screen: The iMac also only comes in one screen size: 24 inches. Some people might find this a bit too cramped, but with no sign of a larger iMac on the horizon, you'll need to look elsewhere for something with a big screen.\nApple's latest iMac brings a host of new color options, the updated M4 processor, double the base RAM configuration of the M3 iMac, and a lower price tag to boot. There's some serious value here, and we wouldn't blame you if you hadn't noticed it at first because the beautiful new colorways grabbed your eye first.\nOur review unit came in purple and looked absolutely stunning, but you can also choose from blue, pink, yellow, orange, green, and the classic Apple silver.\nIt's not just a pretty face, though; it's got some serious computing power to show off. We scrutinized the M4 iMac's performance for any slow-downs or stutters throughout a range of tests including photo and video editing, gaming, and AI/ML tasks; we couldn't get the M4 chip to fold in everyday scenarios. We ran both Safari and Google Chrome web browsers with upwards of 20 tabs, as well as Slack, Messages, Pixelmator, Preview, Calendar, a couple more apps, and iPhone Mirroring open, and the iMac didn't crash or hang. While more intensive tasks will require a Mac or MacBook with a more powerful M4 Pro or M4 Max chip, for most users, the iMac (M4) will offer more than enough power.\nWhen you consider its design and performance, and with 16GB of RAM finally set as the entry-point, a set of new USB-C Apple Magic peripherals included, and a lower price tag on top of it all, the M4 iMac is easily the best all-in-one PC you can buy.\nRead our in-depth Apple iMac 24-inch (M4) review\nValue | A lower starting price year over year makes the iMac a lot more affordable without undercutting the performance | 4.5/5 | Row 0 - Cell 3 |\nDesign | New colors freshen up a modern design that won't take up much space on your desk | 4.5/5 | Row 1 - Cell 3 |\nDisplay | It's a one-size-fits-all solution, but the 24-inch Retina display is visually immersive for myriad tasks. | 4/5 | Row 2 - Cell 3 |\nPerformance | Apple's M4 chip provides ample power, now and well into the future | 4.5/5 | Row 3 - Cell 3 |\nThe best 15-inch MacBook\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a 15-inch laptop: Apple has done it again, and the latest MacBook Air 15-inch (M4) is the best 15-inch laptop you can buy, and for most people, it's the best big-screen MacBook to get.\n\u2705 You have an Intel-based MacBook: If you have an old Intel-based MacBook, then the new M4 MacBook Air will offer a very noticable upgrade.\n\u274c You have an M2 or M3 MacBook: While the M4 chip is a great performer, I still don't think you'll need to upgrade if you have an M2 or M3 MacBook, as the leap isn't quite worth it.\n\u274c You want the most powerful MacBook: While I think that the MacBook Air 15-inch (M4) is the best large-screen MacBook for most general users, mainly thanks to its slim design and affordable price, if you want a MacBook for demanding tasks like 3D modelling, go for the MacBook Pro 16-inch with M4 Pro or M4 Max instead.\nIf you want a large screen MacBook, then unless you're a creative professional that needs huge amounts of power, I strongly recommend the MacBook Air 15-inch, which for 2025 has been upgraded with the very latest M4 chip.\nI was really impressed when personally reviewing the MacBook Air 15-inch (M4), with the MacBook offering excellent performance, a large and vibrant screen, and a lovely thin and light design that means even with the extra screen space, this is still a laptop you can easily carry around with you.\nI have a bad habit of browsing the web with loads of tabs open in Chrome, but that didn't phase the MacBook Air 15-inch (M4) at all, and with the added memory that comes with the base model (16GB rather than 8GB of previous generations), this is an excellent multi-tasker. I had Premiere Pro running to edit videos while also watching a TV show in the Apple TV app, and the 15-inch MacBook Air kept everything running smoothly - and silently, thanks to the fanless design.\nI should also give a big shoutout to the built-in speakers of the MacBook Air (which are an improvement over the ones found in the smaller 13-inch MacBook Air, which otherwise features a very similar list of specs and features) - the sound they produce is loud, detailed and immersive - especially impressive considering how thin this MacBook is.\nPerhaps best of all, and the reason why I'd recommend the MacBook Air 15-inch (M4) over the MacBook Pro for most people, is that its launch price of $1,199 / \u00a31,199 / AU$2,099, which gives you an M4 chip with a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB of unified memory and 256GB of SSD storage, is $100 / \u00a3200 / AU$100 less than the previous M3 model launched at, making this large-screen MacBook even better value for money.\nRead our full Apple MacBook Air 15-inch (M4) review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice | Now with a new, lower price, the MacBook Air 15-inch (M4) offers excellent value for money. | 4.5 / 5 |\nDesign | The design remains the same, but that's not a bad thing - this is a stylish thin and light 15-inch laptop. However, competitors are beginning to catch up. | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | The MacBook Air 15-inch (M4) is a solid performer that can handle any day to day task you throw at it. It's not a major leap from the M3 model, however. | 4 / 5 |\nAverage rating | The MacBook Air 15-inch (M4) is the best 15-inch laptop you can buy, especially due to its new lower price, which makes it better value than ever. | 4.5 / 5 |\nThe Best Mac for pure performance\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want an extremely powerful and compact workstation: The small size combined with the incredible amount of power the M3 Ultra chip provides means the new Mac Studio really doesn\u2019t have any competition.\n\u2705 You need professional-grade graphics power: The new Mac Studio, especially with the M3 Ultra chip, offers a level of performance that will seriously please demanding power users, particularly when it comes to graphics work.\n\u274c You don\u2019t need pro-grade performance: Even the 'entry level' Mac Studio, with the M4 Max chip, offers a huge amount of power that most people won't need. This is a professional workstation with a spec sheet and price tag to match.\n\u274c You are on a budget: The latest Mac Studio comes with some of the most powerful hardware you can buy for creative tasks, while also coming in a stylish and compact case - and this means this is a very expensive product. If you don't need the power, consider the much cheaper Mac mini instead.\nThe Mac Studio is like a supercharged Mac mini for creative professionals. It's an impressively compact computer that comes packing some serious power in its latest incarnation, thanks to a choice of the M4 Max or M3 Ultra chips. Unlike previous models of the Mac Studio, which kept to single generations of Apple's M-series chips, the latest Mac Studio's base model comes with the very latest M4 Max chip. However, if you want even more power, you can get it with the M3 Ultra.\nWhile the M3 chip is a previous generation, the M3 Ultra is made up of two M3 Max chips connected together, which means it blows past the M4 Max when it comes to intensive workloads.\nThe Mac Studio is a formidable machine when it comes to video editing, coding and 3D modeling. It certainly easily handled any task I threw at it while reviewing the Mac Studio - web browsing with Safari and Chrome, with multiple tabs open was no issue at all, and even the most complex projects that I opened in Adobe Premiere Pro (with footage shot at 4K and above) were incredibly smooth.\nThe super-fast SSD meant that video files were loaded and complex projects saved in seconds (using the Blackmagic Disk Speed Test app, the SSD hit write speeds of 7,115.6 and read speeds of 5,799MB/s).\nEven when I was working with large 4K video files and multi-scene projects (while browsing the web and writing up the review at the same time), the Mac Studio didn't miss a beat.\nThe level of performance available here will be overkill for many people, but if you're looking for a workstation PC for heavy creative workloads, such as editing 8K footage or rendering complex 3D scenes and animations, then the Mac Studio will be a great choice. It's expensive, but worth the investment.\nRead my in-depth Mac Studio (M3 Ultra) review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice | There's no getting away from the fact that the Mac Studio is an expensive bit of kit which will be out of reach for many people, but for the money you do get an incredible workstation. | 3.5 / 5 |\nDesign | The Mac Studio's stylish and compact design really has no rivals. It's something of an engineering marvel considering the powerful components inside, though the lack of upgradability and older wireless tech are a shame. | 4.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | The new Mac Studio, especially equipped with the M3 Ultra chip, offers an incredible level of performance. | 5 / 5 |\nAverage rating | While the Mac Studio won't be for everyone, if it is for you, then you're not going to find another workstation of this calibre. | 4.5 / 5 |\nHow to choose the best Mac and MacBooks for you\nWhat to look for in the best Macs and MacBooks\nWhether it\u2019s the heavyweight 16-inch MacBook Pro or the dinky little Mac mini, it\u2019s not hard to see why the best Macs and MacBooks are the weapons of choice of creative professionals. But thanks to a wide range of different Macs and MacBooks on offer, you don\u2019t need to be a creative professional to use an Apple laptop or PC \u2013 and there\u2019s a good chance that no matter what your needs are, there will be a Mac or MacBook for you.\nBut, with all this choice, it can be tricky to find the best Mac or MacBook for your particular needs. To help, I\u2019ve listed some of the most important things I consider when deciding whether or not to include a product in this buying guide, and this criteria can also help you when picking a new Mac or MacBook to buy.\nPerformance: Since 2020, and the unveiling of the M1 chip, Apple has been making its own Arm-based silicon to power modern Macs and MacBooks, rather than relying on Intel.\nIf that all sounds a bit jargony and complex, fear not, as the move has simplified things in some ways. The M1 was the first generation of Apple\u2019s own chips, followed by the M2, then M3 and finally the M4, which is the latest chip.\nThis gives you an idea of how recent a Mac is, and each new generation brings efficiency and performance improvements. The speed of these generational releases (four in the past five years) does mean that people with, say, an M2-powered Mac shouldn\u2019t really feel the need to upgrade to an M4 model, as the performance difference isn\u2019t quite big enough to justify buying a whole new Mac or MacBook.\nIt also means that with each new generation, previous generations often see price cuts, so if you\u2019re on a tight budget, buying an M2 or M3 Mac could be a better choice than buying an M4 model.\nThere are also more powerful variants of these chips which come in Pro and Max configurations. These offer much higher performance and are only found in MacBook Pro laptops, Mac Studio and the higher-end Mac mini, as these are Macs aimed at people (mainly professionals) who need additional performance. Meanwhile, the MacBook Air and iMac are aimed at more casual customers, so the more affordable base M chips are used.\nAnother thing to consider when weighing up how powerful a Mac is, is the amount of memory it comes with. Apple\u2019s modern Macs use unified memory, and this means the memory is shared across the hardware \u2013 so instead of having separate system RAM and video memory (VRAM), the memory is pooled and used depending on the tasks you\u2019re running.\nUp until recently, Apple\u2019s starting configurations for its base models of Macs came with 8GB of unified memory. However, with ever-more intensive apps being released, that amount of memory was increasingly being seen as too little. Thankfully, Apple got the message, and now new Macs and MacBooks come with 16GB by default.\nThe more unified memory a Mac or MacBook has, the better it is at multitasking (having multiple apps open at once, for instance), and these days 16GB should be the minimum. For future-proofing, going up to 24GB or 32GB will give you even better performance. If you want to also use the Mac for graphically-intensive tasks, then consider 64GB or higher considering that the memory will be shared across the hardware.\nEfficiency and battery life: Apple\u2019s M-series of chips aren\u2019t just great performers, they are also excellent at power efficiency, mainly thanks to their Arm architecture and the combination of performance cores (used when running intensive tasks) and efficiency cores (for when you\u2019re doing less intensive work, such as browsing the web). The M-series chips can intelligently switch between the two types of cores depending on what you\u2019re doing.\nThis means that the components don\u2019t use too much power, and that can result in extremely impressive battery lives for MacBooks, with most modern Apple laptops reaching 20 hours on a single charge.\nThis power efficiency also means less heat is produced when the components are running, and that has allowed Apple to produce impressively slim and compact devices, especially with the Mac mini, MacBook Air and iMac.\nIn some cases, such as the MacBook Air 13-inch (M4) and MacBook Air 15-inch (M4) this efficiency has meant Apple has been able to ditch internal fans as well. These fanless laptops are completely silent when in use.\nDisplay and design: MacBooks, especially MacBook Pros, come with some of the best screens you can find in a laptop. Thanks to a combination of high resolutions and wide color support, even the entry-level MacBooks look fantastic.\nThe more expensive models will often also boast adaptive refresh rates, known as ProMotion, which can make tasks, especially scrolling through websites and documents, as well as playing games, feel much smoother, while also helping to prolong battery life. The MacBook Pro range also have XDR (Extreme Dynamic Range) technology, which offer a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio, leading to incredibly bright and vibrant image quality with extremely dark blacks.\nUnlike other Macs, the iMac comes with a built-in screen, and while it lacks some of the visual bells and whistles that the (much more expensive) MacBook Pros come with, you still get a great-looking 23.5-inch screen with a 4.5K Retina resolution and support for the Wide color (P3) gamut, which means colors are reproduced accurately, making it ideal for photographers and film makers.\nFor Macs without a display, I concentrate on the overall design of the PCs, along with the ports that allow you to connect them to a monitor or TV. Thanks to the compact designs of the Mac mini and Mac Studio, these can easily be hooked up to a screen, and even placed out of sight behind the screen for an extremely clean-looking setup.\nValue for money: Last, but definitely not least, I always consider the value proposition of a Mac or MacBook when deciding if it should go into this best Mac and MacBook list, and this should also be a very important consideration when you\u2019re looking to buy.\nWhen I talk about value for money, that doesn\u2019t just mean seeing if it\u2019s the cheapest product. After all, Apple isn\u2019t known for making budget devices. Instead, I consider how much it charges for its products compared to rival products that offer similar performance, design and features.\nSo, while the Mac mini and MacBook Air aren\u2019t the cheapest PC or laptop you can buy, they offer fantastic value for money as they offer experiences that rival products simply cannot compete with. In some cases, such as with the latest MacBook Air 13-inch (M4), Apple has even reduced the launch price compared to the previous model.\nEven with super-expensive Macs and MacBooks, such as the 16-inch MacBook Pro, their value should also be considered. If you need a powerful device to work on, investing in a high-end MacBook Pro, or even a Mac Studio, could end up providing excellent value for money despite their high price tags, especially if it enables you to finish projects more quickly, or means you don\u2019t need to upgrade the device for many, many years.\nOn the other hand, buying one of these devices when you don\u2019t need the level of performance they offer means they can be poor value, no matter how good they are.\nHow we test the best MacBooks and Macs\nTesting the best MacBooks and Macs is more intensive than you might think, especially because most of these devices are meant to be used by creative professionals with more taxing workloads.\nAside from putting any given Mac\u2019s build, display (if it has one), keyboard, trackpad, and webcam through their paces, we also perform creative benchmark tests like Handbrake, as well as run demanding workflows like editing an 8K video in Final Cut Pro and doing real-time 3D modeling and animation to see how every device fares in real-world situations. We also test battery life and take a look at heat management performance when running such intensive tasks.\nFAQs\nAre MacBooks touchscreen?\nNo. Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs was famously dismissive of the idea of touchscreen laptops, and current CEO Tim Cook seems to agree, as there's no sign that we'll get a touchscreen MacBook anytime soon. If you're after a 2-in-1 laptop, then you'll need to look at a Windows 11 laptop instead.\nIf you're determined to stick with Apple, then the closest you're going to get to a touchscreen MacBook is an iPad Pro with iPad Magic Keyboard.\nDo Macs need antivirus?\nFor decades, the recieved wisdom was that Macs didn't need antivirus software, as due to the vast popularity of Windows PCs compared to Macs running macOS, virus makers would target Windows due to the much larger amount of potential victims.\nWhile Windows 11 laptops and PCs still dominate, Macs and MacBooks have increased in popularity, and sadly that also means that viruses and malware targeting Mac users has also surged.\nHowever, for most users, you likely won't need an antivirus for your Mac, as long as you are careful. That means not opening emails, links or files from people or companies you don't know and being careful about what applications you download from the internet. As a general rule, downloading apps from Apple's own App Store for Macs will ensure that the downloads are virus-free, as Apple is careful to approve every app.\nThe Mac operating system, macOS, also has some good built-in security features which prevent downloaded apps from installing automatically without you knowing. However, if you want extra protection, or you use your Mac for essential work, then it's worth looking into the best Mac antivirus software for peace of mind.\nDo Macs have USB or HDMI ports?\nIt depends on the Mac you buy. Both the Mac mini and Mac Studio come with HDMI. Both the Mac Studio and Mac mini (M4) have HDMI 2.1 and support one display with up to 8K resolution at 60Hz, or 4K resolution at 240Hz.\nWhen it comes to MacBooks, both the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros come with a HDMI 2.1 port as well.\nMeanwhile, because the iMac has a built-in screen, and is aimed at more casual users, it does not come with an HDMI port. Neither do either size of MacBook Air. Instead, they use USB-C to connect to external screens. If the Mac or MacBook comes with Thunderbolt 4 USB ports you can connect one display with up 60Hz over DisplayPort 1.4.\nIf your Mac or MacBook comes with Thunderbolt 5 USB ports, you can use DisplayPort 2.1 and output to up to three external displays: two with 6K resolution and 60Hz refresh rate, plus one running at up to 8K at 60Hz.\nThe Mac mini, Mac Studio and MacBook Pros also have USB-C as well as HDMI ports, and those can also be used with external screen alongside HDMI and, in the case of the MacBook Pros, the built-in screen.\n- Want more choices?
