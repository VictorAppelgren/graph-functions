  "description": "New data from Seniorly reveals that seniors in 41 states risk outliving savings. New York tops the list with a $448K deficit. See where your state ranks.",
  "content": "A new analysis from Seniorly has put the American retirement crisis into black-and-white numbers. On a national basis, seniors in 41 of the 50 states, along with those in Washington, D.C., are projected to outlive their savings. Specifically, Seniorly sees those seniors falling short of their retirement needs by an average of $115,000.\n\nRead Next: 50 Cheapest Places To Retire Across America\n\nExplore More: How Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires \u2014 and How You Can, Too\n\nUnfortunately, this is the stark reality that many Americans are facing when it comes to retirement. But as bad as these stats from Seniorly are, things are even worse in the great state of New York.\n\nAlso see how long $1 million in retirement will last in every state.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Deficit in New York?\n\nAccording to Seniorly, New York is No. 1 in the nation when it comes to coming up short in terms of retirement needs. The average senior in New York is expected to face a $448,000 shortfall in retirement. Total expenses are projected at $1.12 million, but retirement income is only $670,000 on average, according to the data.\n\nNew York is not the most expensive state. In fact, four other states (as well as Washington, D.C.) have higher projected expenses:\n\nBut New York is still tops in terms of a retirement savings deficit because incomes are higher in these locations. Hawaii, for example, has the highest total retirement income in the nation, at $1.32 million. That\u2019s almost double the income in New York, resulting in the disparity.\n\nHowever, Hawaii still ranks No. 2 in terms of a retirement deficit for its seniors. Massachusetts, California and Washington, D.C., rank No. 6, No. 5 and No. 3, respectively.\n\nCheck Out: 25 Cities Where You Can Retire in Great Weather for $2,000 a Month\n\nWhat States Have the Biggest Cushions?\n\nResults of the study vary from state to state, but the bottom line is that only nine states have an average income that exceeds the average expenses in retirement.\n\nHow Can You Secure Your Retirement?\n\nThe good thing about retirement projections is that they are just that \u2014 projections. While you can\u2019t control every variable when it comes to retirement planning, you can greatly increase your chances for outliving your money. Here are some important steps, according to Seniorly:\n\u2022 Use tools: There are plenty of online calculators that can help you determine how long your savings will last. Play with different variables, such as your investment return, longevity and expenses, to see how they can affect your overall outcome.\n\u2022 Don\u2019t assume you\u2019re average: No one understands your lifestyle needs better than you do. While the state-by-state averages can be a starting place, tweak that data based on your own personal real-world income and expenses to get a more accurate projection.\n\u2022 Optimize your Social Security strategy: You might want to consider working with a financial professional to help you choose the best time to claim your Social Security benefits.\n\u2022 Factor in unexpected expenses: Income, investment returns and expenses are all variables that may not come in exactly where you project. To help cover unexpected costs that could otherwise derail your financial plan, build an emergency fund and consider additional insurance, such as long-term care and/or umbrella policies.\n\u2022 Talk about your plan: Whether it\u2019s with your spouse, significant other, adult children or financial advisor, bouncing your plan off someone can provide you with insights you might overlook in terms of how your strategy might meet your needs.\n\nIn addition to these tips, take a hard look at your income, spending patterns and investment returns. If your cost of living is too high, consider moving to a lower-cost state to improve your chances of outliving your money. If there\u2019s a way to boost your income, take advantage of it as early as you can so you can build your assets. If your portfolio is too conservative to meet your needs, consider adding a bit of risk to help you grow your nest egg, as long as it remains within your risk tolerance. This is where a fiduciary financial advisor can be helpful.\n\u2022 How Happy Couples Handle Money -- Even When They Disagree\n\u2022 How Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires -- and How You Can, Too\n\u2022 5 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: Retirees in This State Will Outlive Savings by Almost Half a Million Dollars",

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nIt\u2019s possible for retirees to live on Social Security alone, but according to ChatGPT, it\u2019s challenging, and rarely enough for a comfortable and secure retirement.\nSocial Security was never intended to cover the entire cost of living in retirement, but in some situations, there are those who can make it work. Here\u2019s what ChatGPT had to say about what Social Security covers, if it\u2019s enough, and who is living on this income alone.\nWhat Social Security Typically Covers\nAccording to the Social Security Administration (SSA), Social Security will replace about 40% of annual pre-retirement earnings on average. So, someone earning $60,000 per year on average throughout their working years can expect roughly $2,000 per month in Social Security income at full retirement age.\n\u201cThat may cover essentials in low-cost areas, but it often falls short of a full budget,\u201d ChatGPT said.\nIs That Enough?\nFor most retirees, Social Security income is not enough to live on.\nAs of June 2025, the SSA\u2019s latest data showed the average monthly benefit for retired workers was $2,005.05 per month, or about $24,060 annually. But according to the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data, individuals aged 65 and older spent an average of $60,087 in 2023.\nAnd these figures are often higher in high-cost areas. \u201cEven retirees who own their homes often face rising expenses like utilities, food and medical bills,\u201d ChatGPT added.\nRetirement experts typically recommend replacing about 70% to 80% of pre-retirement income through a combination of Social Security benefits, investments and personal savings, SSA reportrd.\nWho Is Living on Social Security Alone\nWhile it\u2019s difficult, it\u2019s not impossible.\nA survey conducted by The Senior Citizens League found that 27% of older Americans rely solely on Social Security for their income.\nIn one example shared by Business Insider, Taffi Ozenne, a 68-year-old retiree living in northern California, has no retirement savings and lives on her $1,739 monthly Social Security check plus what she earns from part-time work.\nAnother retiree, Susan Harper, lives on less than $1,000 in Social Security benefits plus SNAP with no investment income. However, she is able to save on some costs by living with her sister in Washington, D.C., until she\u2019s approved for low-income housing.\nLiving on Social Security can be done, but it usually comes with trade-offs, including reliance on public assistance or help from family."

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nIf your idea of the perfect retirement is to enjoy leisurely mornings, you\u2019ll need to start preparing ahead of time. Retirement planning starts while you\u2019re still working. No matter how old you are, now is the perfect time to create a savings plan to help you retire comfortably.\nTo ease the process of planning for retirement, it\u2019s a good idea to break it down into some basic steps. You\u2019ll start by creating a vision of your retirement lifestyle, helping turn it over the years as you build your savings. Let\u2019s dig into the need-to-know, essential details for proper retirement planning.\n1. Start Saving Now\nEven if you are fresh out of high school, it\u2019s never too early to start saving for retirement. A good first step is looking at the different savings plans available.\nOne option is to open a high-yield savings account dedicated to your retirement savings. Many Americans rely on company-sponsored 401(k) plans to build retirement savings. Other options include:\n- One-participant 401(k)s if you are a business owner with no employees\n- 403(b)s\n- Traditional individual retirement accounts (IRAs)\n- Roth IRAs\n- SIMPLE IRAs\n2. Contribute to Your Employer\u2019s Retirement Savings Plan\nIf your employer offers a 401(k) plan or other retirement plan, sign up and contribute. This is the best and easiest way to start building a retirement fund. When you use an employer-sponsored plan, your employer handles the heavy lifting. All you have to do is agree to have money deducted from your paycheck every pay cycle. You also get tax advantages. And if your employer matches your contribution, you get free money that goes into your retirement savings.\nIn 2025, employees can contribute up to $23,500 in their:\n- 401(k)\n- 403(b)\n- 457 plans\n- The federal government\u2019s Thrift Savings Plan\n3. Find Out About Your Employer\u2019s Pension Plan\nMany government employers offer a traditional pension plan rather than a 401(k) plan. If your employer offers a pension plan, find out if you\u2019re covered. You can ask for an individual benefit statement to understand your pension\u2019s value and ensure you know what\u2019s happening with your benefits before changing jobs.\n4. Invest In an IRA\nIf you don\u2019t have access to a 401(k) or pension plan, you should start investing in an IRA to build your nest egg. IRAs offer tax benefits that bolster your retirement savings over time. Even if you have a company-sponsored plan, invest in an IRA to save faster. Keep in mind that the maximum you can contribute to an IRA in 2025 is $7,000 a year.\nHowever, you get an additional \u201ccatch-up\u201d contribution of $1,000 to bring the total to $8,000 if you\u2019re 50 or older.\n5. Balance Your Portfolio\nSaving money for retirement is only part of your overall strategy. You also need to make sure your investments have the right mix of:\n- Stocks\n- Bonds\n- Mutual funds\n- ETFs\n- Real estate\n- Other assets\nSpreading your investments across diverse assets can mitigate risk and produce steady returns over time.\n6. Don\u2019t Touch Your Retirement Savings\nIt\u2019s important to never dip into these accounts unless you\u2019re facing a financial emergency. Taking loans and early withdrawals from your retirement savings can set your retirement plans back years. For example, if your 401(k) plan allows you to take a loan, you\u2019ll be required to repay it \u2014 including interest \u2014 according to strict terms. If you don\u2019t adhere to these requirements, any unpaid amounts will become a plan distribution.\nIn most cases, you\u2019ll have to include any previously untaxed amount of the distribution in your gross income the year the distribution occurred. You might also face an additional 10% tax on the amount of the taxable distribution.\n7. Set Retirement Goals\nOnce you have done the early planning, you should set a target age for retirement. Some people choose to continue working well into their 60s and 70s, especially if they enjoy your work. Others prefer to step out of the workforce to travel or spend time with loved ones while they are still in good health.\nYou\u2019ll also need to envision your ideal retirement lifestyle. Things to consider include:\n- Where you\u2019ll live\n- How much your lifestyle will cost\n- Whether you need to earn extra money through a part-time job or side gig\n8. Determine How Much Money You\u2019ll Need\nA big part of enjoying retirement is having enough money to live your ideal lifestyle. The U.S. Department of Labor recommends having 70% to 90% of your income to maintain your current standard of living. If you\u2019re currently earning $60,000 per year, you\u2019ll likely need $42,000 to $54,000 per year in retirement, or $3,500 to $4,500 per month.\nIf you think Social Security will cover most of this cost, you\u2019re probably mistaken. As of May 2025, the average Social Security retirement benefit was about $2,002 a month, according to the Social Security Administration. That\u2019s not nearly enough to cover the average living costs in the United States.\nTo help you formulate a good savings goal, look at the retirement calculator from GOBankingRates. You can use it to determine how much you might need to save for retirement. To figure out the right amount, it will use factors such as:\n- Retirement age\n- Savings\n- Income\n9. Familiarize Yourself With Social Security Benefits\nYou can start claiming Social Security benefits as early as age 62. However, delaying your claim can increase your monthly payments. The full retirement age is when you qualify for full benefits. That\u2019s considered 66 or 67 depending on when you were born.\nAfter age 70, there\u2019s no financial benefit to delaying further. To be eligible for Social Security retirement benefits, you need a minimum of 10 years of work, equivalent to 40 credits. Your benefit amount is calculated based on your 35 highest-earning years.\n10. Hire a Professional\nPlanning for retirement is not just about setting aside money for the future. You should develop an investment strategy that maximizes your returns and helps build an adequate nest egg for your golden years. This involves:\n- Understanding different investments\n- Managing risk\n- Planning for a long retirement to ensure you don\u2019t run out of money\n- Learning the tax laws and how best to navigate them\nIf you have the resources, you should hire a financial advisor. They can help you put together the best plan for your personal financial situation and retirement goals.\nWhat Should I Do 5 Years Before Retirement?\nIf you\u2019re retirement planning for the next five years, you\u2019re probably getting excited for this new chapter. Many of the decisions you make now can have a lasting impact on your retirement lifestyle. This period and the first five years after retirement are known as the fragile decade.\nYou want to ensure you\u2019re taking the right steps now to ensure a smooth financial transition into your golden years. Some actions to take include:\n- Maximize all of your retirement accounts if you can do so.\n- Take a close look at your current budget. Pay down as much debt as possible.\n- Consider purchasing supplemental coverage to assist with medical costs.\n- If you haven\u2019t already, reach out to a fee-only financial planner to make sure your investment plan is on track.\n- Decide exactly where you\u2019ll live and use this to determine your estimated cost of living.\n- Take a closer look at your estimated Social Security monthly benefit.\n- If you don\u2019t already, make sure you have an emergency fund in place, so you don\u2019t have to take extra money out of a taxable retirement fund or get a job if you\u2019re faced with an unexpected major expense.\nFinal Take To GO\nIt\u2019s never too early or too late to start planning for retirement. The more time you spend thinking about the kind of life you want and taking steps to prepare for it now, the more likely you are to enjoy your golden years.\nEven if retirement is a long way away, today\u2019s actions will hugely impact your future. Opening a retirement savings account and contributing a portion of each paycheck might mean you have to sacrifice a bit now, but that\u2019s nothing compared to the amount you\u2019ll have to stretch your budget in retirement without proper savings.\nAllison Hache and Jennifer Taylor contributed to the reporting for this article."

On a national basis, seniors in 41 of the 50 states, along with those in Washington, D.C., are projected to outlive their savings. Specifically, Seniorly sees those seniors falling short of their retirement needs by an average of $115,000.\nUnfortunately, this is the stark reality that many Americans are facing when it comes to retirement. But as bad as these stats from Seniorly are, things are even worse in the great state of New York.\nAlso see how long $1 million in retirement will last in every state.\nWhat\u2019s the Deficit in New York?\nAccording to Seniorly, New York is No. 1 in the nation when it comes to coming up short in terms of retirement needs. The average senior in New York is expected to face a $448,000 shortfall in retirement. Total expenses are projected at $1.12 million, but retirement income is only $670,000 on average, according to the data.\nNew York is not the most expensive state. In fact, four other states (as well as Washington, D.C.) have higher projected expenses:\n- Hawaii: $1.74 million\n- Massachusetts: $1.31 million\n- California: $1.26 million\n- Washington, D.C.: $1.14 million\nBut New York is still tops in terms of a retirement savings deficit because incomes are higher in these locations. Hawaii, for example, has the highest total retirement income in the nation, at $1.32 million. That\u2019s almost double the income in New York, resulting in the disparity.\nHowever, Hawaii still ranks No. 2 in terms of a retirement deficit for its seniors. Massachusetts, California and Washington, D.C., rank No. 6, No. 5 and No. 3, respectively.\nWhat States Have the Biggest Cushions?\nResults of the study vary from state to state, but the bottom line is that only nine states have an average income that exceeds the average expenses in retirement.\n| State | Expected Surplus |\n| Washington | $146,000 |\n| Utah | $121,000 |\n| Montana | $43,000 |\n| Colorado | $38,000 |\n| Iowa | $32,000 |\n| Minnesota | $23,000 |\n| Maryland | $13,000 |\n| Kansas | $8,000 |\n| South Carolina | $2,000 |\nHow Can You Secure Your Retirement?\nThe good thing about retirement projections is that they are just that \u2014 projections. While you can\u2019t control every variable when it comes to retirement planning, you can greatly increase your chances for outliving your money. Here are some important steps, according to Seniorly:\n- Use tools: There are plenty of online calculators that can help you determine how long your savings will last. Play with different variables, such as your investment return, longevity and expenses, to see how they can affect your overall outcome.\n- Don\u2019t assume you\u2019re average: No one understands your lifestyle needs better than you do. While the state-by-state averages can be a starting place, tweak that data based on your own personal real-world income and expenses to get a more accurate projection.\n- Optimize your Social Security strategy: You might want to consider working with a financial professional to help you choose the best time to claim your Social Security benefits.\n- Factor in unexpected expenses: Income, investment returns and expenses are all variables that may not come in exactly where you project. To help cover unexpected costs that could otherwise derail your financial plan, build an emergency fund and consider additional insurance, such as long-term care and/or umbrella policies.\n- Talk about your plan: Whether it\u2019s with your spouse, significant other, adult children or financial advisor, bouncing your plan off someone can provide you with insights you might overlook in terms of how your strategy might meet your needs.\nIn addition to these tips, take a hard look at your income, spending patterns and investment returns. If your cost of living is too high, consider moving to a lower-cost state to improve your chances of outliving your money. If there\u2019s a way to boost your income, take advantage of it as early as you can so you can build your assets. If your portfolio is too conservative to meet your needs, consider adding a bit of risk to help you grow your nest egg, as long as it remains within your risk tolerance. This is where a fiduciary financial advisor can be helpful.\nMore From GOBankingRates"

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nYou\u2019ll often see investment advice referring to your personal risk tolerance. This can be tricky to understand and apply because it differs from person to person, and it should also change over time as your investment goals evolve. So what exactly is risk tolerance, and how can you better understand this somewhat open-ended term?\nKeep reading for an in-depth look at risk tolerance, what it means and how to determine what yours is.\nAlso see five things to know if you\u2019re scared to invest.\nWhat Is Risk Tolerance?\nOne way to look at risk tolerance is through the amount you\u2019re willing to gamble when making investments. That\u2019s ultimately a personal decision, but you can think of it as a combination of your comfort level with potentially losing the money you put into an investment and practical considerations, like how much you can realistically afford to lose.\nHow To Determine Your Risk Tolerance\nDeciding how you feel about risks might be difficult, but there are some important questions to ask yourself, as well as some concrete factors around which you can base some of your choices.\n- Psychological and emotional factors: This is first on the list for a reason. No investment is worth your peace of mind, and if you\u2019re likely to be anxious about potential risks, you\u2019ll want to avoid them as much as possible. You might lose out on some opportunities, but safe, reliable options, like high-yield savings accounts and bonds, might be a better choice for you. Don\u2019t lose sleep over the chance to make money.\n- Your financial situation: This may be the most important element when you\u2019re thinking about risk tolerance. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. How much you earn, how much you have in savings, how much debt you carry and your overall financial health are all important things to carefully consider.\n- Your age: If you\u2019re a younger investor, you\u2019re likely to have more tolerance for risk because you\u2019ll have plenty of time to recover from any losses. Older investors don\u2019t have that luxury and should ideally be more cautious.\n- Your investment goals: Your reasons for investing can be a great way to determine your risk tolerance. If your goal is just to increase your wealth, you might be able to handle riskier but potentially more lucrative opportunities. If you\u2019re saving for retirement, you want a safe, predictable and reliable way to invest.\n- Your level of expertise: If you\u2019re new to investing, you likely have a lot to learn and should consider that when choosing investment opportunities. More experienced investors who better understand risk and reward may be able to stomach a little more uncertainty at less peril.\nRisk Tolerance and Investment Strategies\nDeciding how comfortable you are with risks is just the first part of developing an investment strategy. Knowing how to put it into practice is just as important.\nLow Risk Tolerance\nSomeone who\u2019s likely to worry, older investors, and investors with limited capital or experience should probably adopt a low tolerance for risky investments. This conservative approach emphasizes sure and steady over high-risk, high-reward opportunities. Though you may not enjoy the same returns as investors who are more comfortable with taking on risks, you\u2019ll be shielded from the higher potential for losses.\nThe following are some relatively safe bets for low-risk investors.\n- Fixed-income securities: These are investments like bonds, Treasury bills and other fixed-income financial products that offer regular, predictable interest payments with little risk.\n- Dividend-paying stocks: \u201cBlue chip\u201d companies typically have a track record of stability and consistent dividend payments.\n- Cash and cash equivalents: These investments are essentially the same as cash and can quickly be converted into liquid \u2014 spendable \u2014 assets if needed. High-interest savings accounts, certificates of deposit and money market funds are examples of this kind of investment.\nModerate Risk Tolerance\nHaving a moderate risk tolerance means you might be willing to deal with market volatility or a slightly greater chance of losing your stake for the opportunity to realize higher returns. This is a balanced approach, and it can be a good way to invest for those with a stable income, ample time to plan for retirement and at least a basic foundation in investing.\nModerate-risk investments would include things like the following.\n- Balanced funds: Also called multi-asset funds, these are investments in a group of stocks and bonds that offer some insulation from market risks while providing an opportunity for potentially higher returns.\n- Diversified portfolio: This kind of investment requires a broker or financial manager or significantly more investment experience than most people possess. A diversified portfolio is a mix of equities, bonds and other balanced assets that are chosen to spread the risk across different kinds of opportunities.\n- Real estate: Though not all real estate investments are low in risk, they are generally considered safer than other forms of investing, and opportunities like real estate investment trusts offer greater stability with the potential for a steady income and gradual appreciation.\nHigh Risk Tolerance\nIf you\u2019re in a position to take a gamble, lose and not be too adversely affected by the outcome, a high-risk approach might be one to consider. It\u2019s not an exaggeration to call these kinds of investments a gamble, as they typically result in losses more often than gains, but they have the chance of sky-high returns. It bears repeating: Never invest more than you can afford to lose.\nBut if this is a strategy you\u2019re considering, here\u2019s a list of potential options.\n- Growth stocks: As opposed to \u201cvalue stocks,\u201d growth stocks are those of companies with the potential for rapid growth and increasing valuations, though these are generally unpredictable and more volatile investments.\n- Sector funds: Also called specialty funds, these include investments across specific industries, like healthcare, energy or technology.\n- International stocks: These are generally investments in what are referred to as emerging markets, and though they bring the chance of higher returns, they can be significantly more volatile than other opportunities. Currency fluctuations and political instability are just two of the risk factors associated with this kind of investment."

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nPotential cuts to Social Security benefits understandably concerns many retirees. Social Security often comprises a significant portion of income for its near 58 million recipients, according to the Social Security Administration (SSA). A reported insolvency in seven years may create growing unease for those depending on monthly benefits.\nDual-earning couples may see an $18,100 annual reduction in benefits, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB). Amounts can vary depending on specific circumstances. Taking prudent action now can help provide income to offset any loss in benefits.\nBefore considering any backup income source, retirees should consult with a trusted financial advisor to create a plan.\nRetirement Accounts\nIRAs and 401(k) accounts are popular retirement planning tools for many Americans. Roughly 54% of Americans had such accounts in 2022, according to Congress.gov. Wisely tapping these accounts can be a good way to complement a reduction in benefits.\n\u201cIf you have 401(k)s, IRAs or other retirement accounts, it is time to make a plan to access them if your Social Security benefits get squeezed. The challenge is to set up a withdrawal and tax plan that maximizes the income you can get from your retirement accounts across the rest of your life,\u201d said Jay Zigmont, PhD, certified financial planner (CFP) and founder at Childfree Trust.\nSpeaking with an advisor can help seniors create a withdrawal plan.\nAn Annuity\nAnnuities often get a bad rap, thanks to fees and other potential charges. While not for everyone, an annuity can be a good fit for some retirees. Fixed annuities commonly have reduced points of entry, making them easier for seniors to purchase.\n\u201cOne of the most reliable ways to create backup income in retirement is through fixed indexed annuities with guaranteed income riders,\u201d noted Matt Eilers, CEO and Founder of Medalist Wealth Management. \u201cThese income sources grow based on the performance of a stock index, like the S&P 500, but the principal is protected against market volatility, and the income riders guarantee a predictable income payment through retirement.\u201d\nA Part-Time Job\nHaving a part-time job in retirement may not be desirable, but it can be a good way to supplement Social Security payments. Retirees can earn up to $62,160, as of 2025, before benefits are reduced, according to the SSA.\nWorking a side gig may be attractive, but Zigmont advises seniors to look elsewhere for work.\n\u201cWhile gig work, like driving for Uber, may be popular, it is unpredictable and comes with other costs. Part-time jobs are probably the best bet, as you don\u2019t need the benefits,\u201d said Zigmont.\nDividend-Paying Stocks\nInvesting in dividend-paying stocks has long been a way for retirees to earn income. Americans can house such investments in both retirement and non-retirement accounts. Holding them in the latter can provide cash flow, and lower-income retirees may face 0% federal tax on them, if they\u2019re classified as qualified dividends, according to Fidelity.\nThis strategy poses some risk of placing you in a higher tax bracket and potentially losing the tax deferral benefits found in retirement accounts. Speak with an advisor to identify if this is an option for you.\nUse Your Home\nFor many Americans, their home is their most valuable asset. If you can downsize, it can free up cash. For example, if your current home is paid off and worth $350,000, and you move to a $200,000 home, that\u2019s $150,000 in cash you can claim, before fees tied to selling the house. Such an amount could offset a reduction in benefits.\nA reverse mortgage is another possibility, but it may not be worth the risks and fees associated with such an action.\nA reduction in Social Security benefits can cause grave concern for many seniors. Pairing the right backup income source with reduced spending can help mitigate the financial impact."

These expenses are now coming back to bite them.\nWhat are they, and how can succeeding generations avoid these often innocent mistakes?\nLong-Term Care Planning\nPatrice Williams-Lindo, CEO of Career Nomad, saw just how painfully pricey long-term care for seniors can be while helping both her parents and in-laws navigate aging, illness and end-of-life care.\n\u201cI can tell you firsthand: the costs boomers didn\u2019t plan for aren\u2019t just financial \u2014 they\u2019re emotional, generational and systemic,\u201d Williams-Lindo said. \u201cMy family was quoted over $6,000/month for quality assisted living in Georgia. Multiply that over a few years and you\u2019re talking hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2014 money most didn\u2019t save because they assumed retirement meant rest; not round-the-clock care.\u201d\nMany financial experts, including Jay Zigmont, PhD, MBA, CFP, founder and CEO of Childfree Wealth, agreed with Williams-Lindo that lack of long-term care planning among boomers \u2014 and younger generations \u2014 is among the worst and costliest mistakes.\n\u201cA year in a skilled nursing facility runs $115k, on average. Men will spend 2.2 years in care, and women 3.7,\u201d Zigmont said. \u201cWithout a plan to pay for long-term care, the first person that needs care may cause their spouse to go broke.\u201d\nLong-term care, whether you pay out of pocket or with a long-term care insurance policy, is incredibly expensive, so it makes sense that so many boomers didn\u2019t bother.\n\u201cFor a couple that wants to pay out of pocket, I recommend setting aside $500k now,\u201d Zigmont said. \u201cIf you are single, you also need to set aside $500k. That may not make sense on the surface, but with a couple, your spouse often provides care for some time, making the total cost lower.\u201d\nInflation\nA common unplanned for expense that Frederick Saide, managing partner at MoneyMattersUSA, Advisory LLC often sees coming back to haunt boomers is inflation.\n\u201cI often get the response, \u2018That\u2019s not my problem,'\u201d Saide told GOBankingRates. \u201cThe assumption is retirement will not last all that long \u2014 certainly not 30 or more years \u2014 so \u2018I won\u2019t have to go through the inflation cycle three or four times\u2019 is the mindset.\u201d\nTo guide clients, Saide uses the Society of Actuaries and the American Academy of Actuaries calculator on longevity to help establish both individual and joint life expectancies.\n\u201cWhat I want is an agreement on the time horizon to plan for; otherwise, we won\u2019t have a clear direction on how much money is needed to last, and what the client wants their money to achieve for them,\u201d Saide. \u201cThis process is the reality check moment when I show from 2002 to 2023 inflation averaged 5.5%, nearly double the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\u201d\nSocial Security and Pension Tax Burdens\nMany boomers made the mistake of not looking too deeply into the fine print of Social Security and required minimum distributions (RMDs). Specifically, they didn\u2019t study the tax aspect.\n\u201cUp to 85% of Social Security benefits can be taxed, and RMDs can nudge retirees into higher tax brackets, triggering Medicare surcharges,\u201d said Andrew Latham, CFP, content director at Supermoney.com. \u201cRoth conversions in your 60s can help, but many wait too long.\u201d\nEstate Plan Updates\nDid you make a will in your 40s and not update it to reflect your needs and wants in your 60s? A lot of boomers make that mistake.\n\u201cMany times, people adopt a \u2018set it and forget it\u2019 mentality when it comes to estate planning,\u201d said Charles Nemes, co-founder and CEO at Nemes Rush Family Wealth Management. \u201cThis can lead to significant damage to the relationships beneficiaries enjoy today, and potentially put money into their hands when it could actually hurt them more than help them. Unfortunately, estate plans seldom reflect the current feelings of those who drafted them years ago because so many things could have changed. For example, a beneficiary may have issues with drugs/gambling/alcohol, or is getting divorced, has a child with special needs, is getting sued, or is in a high-risk profession.\u201d\nNemes recommended reviewing your estate plan at least every five years to be sure it clearly reflects your current knowledge and feelings about each beneficiary."

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nOn July 18, President Trump signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act into law.\nThe GENIUS Act established regulations for stablecoins: cryptocurrencies pegged to \u201cstable\u201d assets such as the U.S. dollar. It specified \u201cpermitted payment stablecoin issuers\u201d including both banks and nonbank entities. The law also clarified reserve requirements \u2014 the underlying assets held in reserve by the issuer to back the stablecoins, such as U.S. dollars or Treasury bills.\nSo, how might the GENIUS Act impact retirees?\nPotential for Yield\nSome stablecoins are designed to generate a yield, despite being spendable like cash. That yield could come from the underlying reserve asset, or from lending out the underlying asset.\n\u201cFor retirees, stablecoins could offer higher-yielding, low-volatility cash instruments,\u201d explained David Materazzi, CEO of Galileo FX. \u201cIn effect, owners could get the performance of a money market fund with something as spendable as cash. That makes holding liquidity more rewarding without increasing exposure to risk assets.\u201d\nFaster and Cheaper International Payments\nOwners can transfer stablecoins internationally for pennies, and near-instant speeds. That could make life far easier for family members to support one another across borders and currencies.\nMagnus Larsson, founder of fintech company MAJORITY, sees huge advantages for international transfers. \u201cStablecoins, when properly backed and transparent, offer a more efficient way to move money globally without the delays and fees traditional systems impose, transforming money movement much like VoIP transformed telecom.\u201d\nEstate Planning Through Smart Contracts\nCryptocurrencies allow for smart contracts, in which the owner can set up self-executing orders within the blockchain technology. In other words, owners can set up automated transfers within the cryptocurrency itself \u2014 without needing a human intermediary such as a trustee.\n\u201cSmart contracts allow more transparent and controlled gifting, even from beyond the grave,\u201d noted financial planner Christina Lynn of Mariner Wealth Advisors. \u201cWhile this remains speculative, regulated stablecoins could someday support innovative estate planning tools that automate distributions to beneficiaries and reduce traditional trust administration costs.\u201d\nHigh Transparency Means No Privacy\nBlockchain technology stores every transaction in its history. That transparency is useful, but it also makes the owner\u2019s spending public.\n\u201cEvery transaction becomes traceable, timestamped and stored,\u201d observed Materazzi. \u201cRetirees used to cash will lose financial privacy entirely. If stablecoins become the default for Social Security or Medicare reimbursements, then spending data becomes a public-private asset.\u201d\nRisk of Platform Failure\nNonbank entities can now issue stablecoins \u2014 without being FDIC-insured.\nCrypto exchanges have failed in the past, or suffered theft. Remember the Mt. Gox heist in 2014? Hackers made off with 850,000 Bitcoins \u2014 worth over $100 billion today.\nRetirement planning counselor Jake Falcon of Falcon Wealth Advisors sees huge risk among issuers. \u201cWithout FDIC insurance or SIPC protections, losses could be permanent,\u201d he said. \u201cAllowing nonbank entities to issue digital currencies without uniform oversight could echo the 19th-century wildcat banking era, where unregulated banks issued their own notes, often leading to collapse.\u201d\nStablecoins offer both opportunities and risks to retirees. Proceed with caution after speaking with your financial advisor."

      "text": "6 Things You Must Do When Your Savings Reach $50,000\nInvesting Strategies The Wealthy Use That You Should Consider Right Now\nWell done! You\u2019ve worked hard and pinched pennies to finally get to the point where your savings account is looking solid. Now it\u2019s time for the emphasis to shift from saving to making your money work more actively.\nThese moves just might be what you need to keep your money growing. Best of all? It only takes a few minutes to check them out and see which ones are best for you.\nUse an Annuity to Earn Guaranteed Growth on Your Retirement Savings\nOnce you have a substantial nest egg, it's smart to start thinking about your long-term goals and how you can protect what you've built against the unknown -- like a stock market downturn tanking your 401(k) before retirement.\nThat's where an annuity can come in -- they can provide a guaranteed stream of income during retirement at a fixed rate. No stock-market risk involved.\nYou can get started with a Gainbridge\u00ae FastBreak\u2122 annuity with a minimum investment of just $1,000. The more you invest, the higher rate you can earn -- up to 5.80% APY**. The best part? There's no risk to your investment.\nFor context, 5.80% APY is more than 13 times* the average rate on a savings account. Plus, your principal amount is fully protected, unlike when you invest in the stock market.\nThe FastBreak\u2122 annuity is self-directed, easy to set up and comes with 30 days to cancel your contract if you change your mind. Plus you can access up to 10% of your money each year without penalties -- even if you're under 59\u00bd.\nLooking for a predictable, stable way to grow your retirement savings without risking any of your principal investment? Get started here with as little as $1,000 to earn 5.50% APY, or deposit more to earn up to 5.80% APY.\nThey Know You Can Earn Up to a $500 Bonus -- And Boost Your Savings Rate By 10x\nIf you're keeping your dough in a traditional checking account, you're not letting it rise to its full potential. You need an account that lets you earn competitive interest on your everyday balance.\nRaisin, a digital marketplace, makes it easy to find a high-yield savings account with an APY as high as 4.31% -- that's more than 10 times the national average interest on a savings account, which pays just 0.38% APY as of June 16, 2025.\nPlus, when you open an account and deposit funds, you can earn a welcome bonus of up to $500. The more you deposit, the more you can earn.\nThere are no fees from Raisin, and they already have 1 million customers and a 4.5 star rating on Trustpilot.\nWant to start growing your money more than 11 times faster -- and earn up to a $500 bonus? It only takes a few minutes to open an account.\nStop Wasting $1,025 on Your Car Insurance\nOdds are, you're probably paying way too much for your car insurance every month. And it can seriously add up -- to the tune of $1,025 a year.\nFortunately, Insurify lets you compare all your car insurance options at once -- and it can save you up to $1,025 a year.\nJust enter some basic details about your car and background, you'll get customized quotes you can review on your own time and from the comfort of home. Ready to cut your car insurance bill? It's easy to get started here and see how much you can save.\nCollect Rent Checks Without Being a Landlord\nOwning rental property has always been one of the most well-known ways to earn passive income. There's a reason so many rich people do it. There's just one problem -- we can't all afford to just go out and buy an investment property. And we're not exactly dying to be landlords, either.\nLuckily, a company called Arrived lets you invest in rental homes and vacation properties with a minimum investment of just $1,000. The best part? You don't even have to be a landlord. Arrived handles all the nitty gritty work.\nThe process is simple. Just sign up, then browse the available properties, like a single-family rental home in Charlotte, or a vacation rental in the Catskill Mountains. You decide how much you want to invest, then watch for property appreciation and quarterly rental income payments.\nMore than 540,000 people have already invested with Arrived, and it's already paid out $3.5 million in dividends to its investors. Depending on the property and terms of the investment, investing in single-family and vacation-rental properties has historically yielded between 6% and 15% returns.\nWant to start earning passive rental income? Click here to get started and see how much you can earn.\nProtect Your Portfolio With Precious Metals\nIf the past few years have shown us anything, it's that disruptions to the market can come out of nowhere. Between the pandemic, supply-chain issues and bear markets, a lot of people's retirement savings felt the impact.\nThat's why it can be a smart idea to look for ways to protect your retirement savings from the unpredictable. For a lot of people, investing in precious metals is a way to diversify and protect their investments.\nOne way to do this is with a precious metals IRA through a company like Priority Gold. Precious metals often outperform other investments in a volatile market, and their value tends to rise with inflation, making them an effective hedge during uncertain economic times.\nOpening a gold or silver IRA is easy, and you can roll over funds from existing retirement accounts without any taxes or penalty fees. Or you can buy gold and silver directly from Priority Gold's extensive collection.\nWorried you may need to sell your precious metals in the future? Priority Gold offers a no-fee buy-back program. Plus, Priority Gold has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau.\nRight now, Priority Gold is offering up to $10,000 in free silver with qualifying purchases, and you'll get free account setup, free insured shipping and free storage for up to five years.\nWant to diversify and safeguard your investments by adding gold and silver to your portfolio? It's easy to get started here and get your free guide.\nGet Matched with a Financial Advisor for Free\nAs much as we might like to think we have it all figured out, most of us could stand to benefit from an expert opinion -- especially when it comes to our finances. The professionals simply know things we don't.\nBut the idea of getting a financial advisor sounds expensive and tedious. That's why we like a company called WiserAdvisor. They'll match you with a financial advisor in your area -- for free.\nNo two people have the same financial situation, which is why WiserAdvisor matches you with the best financial advisor for your specific situation, so you get an expert in the areas you need.\nThere's no obligation to hire the advisor, and WiserAdvisor screens every advisor to make sure you're only getting matched with the best experts.\nWant to get a customized financial plan? Just start here to get matched with a financial advisor for free.\nBottom Line:\nIt\u2019s just as important to make your money work for you as it is to save. Some key strategies include hedging your savings against inflation with an investment like gold or silver and building passive income through real estate investments. The right financial advisor can give you the best advice for your unique situation.\n*Source: FDIC, national average of savings, week of 02/18/25.

Who could blame you? It seems like the wealthy have all the know-how about living the good life. They\u2019re better connected than you are. They\u2019re more knowledgeable than you are. They\u2019ve got the playbook to create financial windfalls, while you\u2019re still stuck with the 101-level textbooks.\nBut not every millionaire is using secret tricks and pulling hidden levers that the rest of us can\u2019t access. Many of them are quietly growing their portfolios through discipline and strategy \u2014 and there\u2019s absolutely no reason you can\u2019t do it, too.\nSo, how do they do it? These are some of the ways middle-class earners are quietly building wealth and making strategic moves that could help you reach your first million. Learning where to invest smartly is a crucial first step \u2014 and it\u2019s often easier than you might think.\n1. They Use an Annuity to Earn Guaranteed Growth on Their Retirement Savings\nMiddle-income earners who hit the million-dollar mark don\u2019t rely solely on traditional methods. They know the average savings account doesn\u2019t pay enough interest and that the stock market can be volatile.\nThat\u2019s where an annuity can come in \u2014 not only can it grow your money much faster, it can also earn you guaranteed income during retirement at a fixed rate.

They Invest in Real-Estate Loans \u2014 and Earn 8.1% in Dividends\nLoaning people money and charging interest is one of the ways large institutions and the ultra-wealthy earn passive income. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s typically available to the average person.\nBut with the Arrived Private Credit Fund, you can invest in a portfolio of real-estate loans that pay dividends monthly \u2014 with a historic yield of 8.10% annualized dividends.\nArrived is a platform backed by Jeff Bezos, Marc Benioff, and other top-tier investors, with more than 800,000 registered users and nearly $300 million invested.\nHere\u2019s how it works: You\u2019ll invest in a diversified portfolio of loans across the U.S. that help fund renovations, rehabs, and new home construction.

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 YearsHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed by Experts\nTrusted by Millions of Readers\nNo one wants to end up broke in retirement. Yet a third (32%) of retirees say they don\u2019t have enough money to last through retirement, according to a 2024 survey by Schroders.\nIndeed, the Federal Reserve\u2019s most recent Survey of Consumer Finances found that roughly half of Americans have nothing saved for retirement at all.\nEven those who think they have enough may be in for a rude awakening. Consider the following reasons your nest egg may need more padding before you call the job quits.\nHigher Future Tax Rates\nThe Congressional Budget Office projects a federal budget deficit of $1.6 trillion in 2024, and the federal debt rising from 99% of GDP in 2024 to 116% by 2034.\nPoliticians love to spend today and let someone else worry about the bill tomorrow. Unfortunately, that \u201csomeone else\u201d isn\u2019t just their successor in office \u2014 you and I will pay the bill sooner or later, in the form of higher taxes.\nThat could mean higher rates on existing types of taxes, such as income taxes. Or it could mean the government creating new types of taxes to add to our existing tax burden.\n\u201cUncertainty around future income tax rates and proper tax planning is a major consideration for retirement savings,\u201d explains Thomas Schulte, a Certified Financial Planner and partner at Napier Financial. \u201cWhile large pre-tax retirement accounts certainly help, they come with large income tax bills upon distribution.\n\u201cRetirees and soon-to-be retirees should always be asking: What can I do now to be as efficient as possible from a tax perspective?\u201d Consider contributing to Roth accounts instead of traditional retirement accounts, and doing Roth conversions to move your existing funds from a traditional to a Roth account.\nInflation: The Silent Tax\nWhen governments get into trouble paying their debts, most don\u2019t default. They simply let inflation run rampant and reduce the value of their debts.\n\u201cRising inflation can quickly erode the purchasing power of your savings,\u201d notes Erika Kullberg, personal finance expert and founder of Erika.com. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen especially in recent years, inflation can make everyday purchases far more expensive over time.\u201d\nEven a \u201chealthy\u201d inflation rate saps your savings when you plan in decades. Tom Buckingham, an actuary and chief growth officer for Nassau Financial Group, notes, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much more than 2% annual inflation for the cost of goods to double over 30 years.\u201d\nTomorrow\u2019s dollar won\u2019t stretch as far as you think, so invest more than you think you need.\nLonger Than Expected Longevity\nWe all assume we\u2019ll live a roughly average lifespan. But life expectancies form a bell curve \u2014 and plenty of people fall on the right-hand side of it.\n\u201cMany people underestimate how long they might live,\u201d observes Buckingham. \u201cAnd that risk is even higher for a married couple. At least one of two 65-year-old spouses has almost a 50% chance of living to at least age 90, and a 20% chance of living to at least age 95.\n\u201cThat\u2019s 25-30 years, or more, in retirement! And, over that time, inflation is likely to have a significant impact on living expenses, not to mention healthcare costs.\u201d\nLate-Life Healthcare Costs\nA study by Fidelity found that the average 65-year-old married couple can expect to spend $315,000 on medical expenses over the course of their retirement.\n\u201cUnexpected healthcare and long-term care costs can and often do crop up,\u201d add Kullberg. \u201cAnd when they do, they have a significant impact on retirement savings.\u201d\nUnderperforming Investments\nYou\u2019ve read it a hundred times: past performance does not guarantee future results.\nThe 4% Rule for safe withdrawal rates is based on past stock and bond markets\u2019 performance. But who\u2019s to say that the stock market will keep generating similar returns in future decades?\nLow birth rates and slowing population growth may rob financial markets of momentum. \u201cFinancial planners put a lot of work into projecting the success of investments for retirement, but those forecasts are fallible,\u201d explains Kullberg.\n\u201cIf your investments underperform, especially with a budget that\u2019s already tight, you may have the savings you need to sustain your lifestyle in retirement.\u201d\nSequence of Returns Risk\nFrighteningly, your long-term average returns could match projections and you could still run out of money.\nKnown as a sequence of returns risk, Buckingham explains that a stock market crash early in your retirement wreaks far more havoc on your portfolio than the same crash later on. \u201cIf a retiree\u2019s assets decline early in their retirement years, it forces them to withdraw a higher percentage of their assets than planned.\u201d\nWithdraw too much early on, and your portfolio shrinks too small to recover \u2014 even when the market bounces back.\nSave more than you think you\u2019ll need for retirement. You can always pass assets on to your children or charities, but it\u2019s a lot harder to add income and replenish a failing nest egg in retirement.\nShare This Article:\nYou May Also Like\n70% of Gen Xers Say They Can't Afford To Retire -- They're Right If They Don't Do These 8 Things\nAugust 21, 2025\n5 min Read\nNearly 42% of Boomers Are Living Paycheck to Paycheck: Here's How It's Delaying Retirement\nAugust 21, 2025\n5 min Read\nHere's How Long $1 Million in Retirement Savings Will Last You After Age 65\nAugust 19, 2025\n5 min Read\nFor Boomers Closing in on Retirement: 5 Ways To Make Sure You're on Track\nAugust 19, 2025\n5 min Read\nI'm a Financial Expert: This Is the No. 1 Thing Every American Should Do With Their 401(k)\nAugust 19, 2025\n5 min Read\n- How Long Will My Money Last?\n- How Much Do You Need To Retire?\n- How To Prepare For Retirement\n- How To Save For Retirement Without A 401K\nLearn More About Early Retirement Planning\nMake your money work for you\nGet the latest news on investing, money, and more with our free newsletter.\nThanks!\nSending you timely financial stories that you can bank on.\nSign up for our daily newsletter for the latest financial news and trending topics.\nFor our full Privacy Policy, click here.\nLooks like you're using an adblocker\nPlease disable your adblocker to enjoy the optimal web experience and access the quality content you appreciate from GOBankingRates.\n- AdBlock / uBlock / Brave\n- Click the ad blocker extension icon to the right of the address bar\n- Disable on this site\n- Refresh the page\n- Firefox / Edge / DuckDuckGo\n- Click on the icon to the left of the address bar\n- Disable Tracking Protection\n- Refresh the page\n- Ghostery\n- Click the blue ghost icon to the right of the address bar\n- Disable Ad-Blocking, Anti-Tracking, and Never-Consent\n- Refresh the page"

A Financial Pro on Managing Money as a Couple\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nQuestion #10 of GOBankingRates\u2019 Top 100 Money Experts Series\nWhat\u2019s the best way to manage money with a partner?\nYou\u2019re sitting at the breakfast table with your partner. Gazing into their eyes, you think about how much you love them, how much they \u2014 to quote \u201cJerry Maguire\u201d \u2014 \u201ccomplete you,\u201d and how fortunate you are to have them.\nJust as you\u2019re about to fall even deeper in love, they open their mouth to tell you they might have, ahem, put a little more on the credit card than they planned. Or perhaps to chide you for not taking your employer match on your 401(k).\nAh, love. Ain\u2019t it grand? It still can be \u2014 even if your money habits clash \u2014 when you learn how to balance different financial styles. That process might sound complex and uncomfortable, but according to Emma Johnson, founder of Wealthy Single Mommy and author of \u201cThe 50/50 Solution\u201d and \u201cThe Kickass Single Mom,\u201d it starts with something simple: listening to each other.\nGOBankingRates caught up with Johnson to get her take on how happy couples can stay happy couples when it comes to managing money together.\nRespect Each Other\u2019s Financial Independence\nOne of Johnson\u2019s first pieces of advice is to recognize that you and your partner are, well, your own people. You each had fully formed identities and managed your own money before you got together. Acting like a parent or boss with your partner\u2019s finances can only breed resentment.\n\u201cEach partner needs some financial autonomy \u2013 money you can spend without checking in first,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cYou\u2019re both adults.\u201d\nTherapists back this up. Given how often couples argue over money, it\u2019s not surprising that services like Ascencion Counseling include financial advice right on their websites. To keep your financial independence while managing joint responsibilities, you and your partner need to communicate and plan together.\nOne common approach is to open a joint account for major shared expenses like rent, utilities and groceries, while keeping separate accounts for personal spending. Once you agree on how much each of you will contribute \u2014 ideally based on income rather than splitting everything 50/50 \u2014 you can still maintain individual control over your own separate accounts.\nThis kind of setup gives each partner more confidence in their financial abilities while also minimizing potential resentment. That\u2019s a win-win.\nLove Each Other Through Your Differences\nOpposites might attract in your favorite rom-com, but in real life, they can cause friction \u2014 and not the fun kind. Johnson acknowledges that differing money habits are tough to navigate.\nBut she wants you both to sit down and ask yourself some hard questions. Do we see our money as shared? How do we feel about keeping separate accounts and spending without checking in? Should joint expenses be split equally or based on income?\n\u201cThere are no right or wrong answers here, and your feelings may change over time. But it\u2019s important to come to some agreement together,\u201d she said. \u201cRemember, these dynamics can change over time, so think about how you\u2019d feel if the situation flipped, because life is long and it very likely could!\u201d\nTiming is everything. Have these conversations when you\u2019re both in a calm and relaxed mood \u2014 not when you\u2019re mid-argument or stressed. You might even plan a special date night where you sit at home over a lovely meal and talk openly about your financial experiences. Share what makes you feel triggered or ashamed. Talk about areas where you feel secure and empowered.\nThis kind of open honesty helps build empathy and prevents unintentional hurt.\nCome Together as a Financial Team\nYou already act as a team in other parts of life, from house training your new puppy to navigating holiday dinners with extended family. Why not do the same with money? Johnson sees financial conversations as a lifelong dialogue, not a one-and-done talk.\n\u201cAsk yourselves: What is a short-term goal \u2014 in the next year \u2014 that we share? What long-term goal \u2013 five years, 10 years, retirement \u2013 do we share? Remember, the conversation is ongoing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will evolve, change and have surprises and upsets. Keep talking and make future planning a fun, positive part of your partnership.\u201d\nBottom Line\nJust because you and your partner approach money differently doesn\u2019t mean your relationship is doomed. Far from it. With some honesty, vulnerability and a willingness to keep the conversation going, you can manage your finances as true partners \u2014 and even grow stronger in the process.\nThis article is part of GOBankingRates\u2019 Top 100 Money Experts series, where we spotlight expert answers to the biggest financial questions Americans are asking.

      "text": "How Middle-Class Earners Are Quietly Becoming Millionaires \u2014 and How You Can, Too\nWhen you sit down with your own budgeting app, watching money go out again as soon as it comes in, you might fantasize about what it would be like to be a millionaire. Who could blame you? It seems like the wealthy have all the know-how about living the good life. They\u2019re better connected than you are. They\u2019re more knowledgeable than you are. They\u2019ve got the playbook to create financial windfalls, while you\u2019re still stuck with the 101-level textbooks.\nBut not every millionaire is using secret tricks and pulling hidden levers that the rest of us can\u2019t access. Many of them are quietly growing their portfolios through discipline and strategy \u2014 and there\u2019s absolutely no reason you can\u2019t do it, too.\nSo, how do they do it? These are some of the ways middle-class earners are quietly building wealth and making strategic moves that could help you reach your first million. Learning where to invest smartly is a crucial first step \u2014 and it\u2019s often easier than you might think.\n1. They Use an Annuity to Earn Guaranteed Growth on Their Retirement Savings\nMiddle-income earners who hit the million-dollar mark don\u2019t rely solely on traditional methods. They know the average savings account doesn\u2019t pay enough interest and that the stock market can be volatile.\nThat\u2019s where an annuity can come in \u2014 not only can it grow your money much faster, it can also earn you guaranteed income during retirement at a fixed rate. No stock-market risk involved.\nYou can get started with a Gainbridge\u00ae FastBreak\u2122 annuity with a minimum investment of just $1,000. The more you invest, the higher rate you can earn \u2014 up to 5.80% APY**. The best part? There\u2019s no risk to your investment.\nFor context, 5.80% APY is more than 13 times* the average rate on a savings account. Plus, your principal amount is fully protected, unlike when you invest in the stock market.\nThe FastBreak\u2122 annuity is self-directed, easy to set up and comes with 30 days to cancel your contract if you change your mind. Plus you can access up to 10% of your money each year without penalties \u2014 even if you\u2019re under 59\u00bd.\nLooking for a predictable, stable way to grow your retirement savings without risking any of your principal investment? Get started here with as little as $1,000 to earn 5.50% APY, or deposit more to earn up to 5.80% APY.\n2. They Know You Can Pocket Up to $500 \u2014 And Boost Your Savings Rate By 10x\nIf you\u2019re keeping your dough in a traditional checking account, you\u2019re not letting it rise to its full potential. You need an account that lets you earn competitive interest on your everyday balance.\nRaisin, a digital marketplace, makes it easy to find a high-yield savings account with an APY as high as 4.31% \u2014 that\u2019s more than 10 times the national average interest on a savings account, which pays just 0.38% APY as of June 16, 2025.\nPlus, when you open an account and deposit funds, you can earn a welcome bonus of up to $500. The more you deposit, the more you can earn.\nThere are no fees from Raisin, and they already have 1 million customers and a 4.5 star rating on Trustpilot.Want to start growing your money more than 11 times faster \u2014 and earn up to a $500 bonus? It only takes a few minutes to open an account.\n3. They Save $1,025 on Their Car Insurance\nOdds are, you\u2019re probably paying way too much for your car insurance every month. And it can seriously add up \u2014 to the tune of $1,025 a year.\nFortunately, Insurify lets you compare all your car insurance options at once \u2014 and it can save you up to $1,025 a year.\nJust enter some basic details about your car and background, you\u2019ll get customized quotes you can review on your own time and from the comfort of home. Ready to cut your car insurance bill? It\u2019s easy to get started here and see how much you can save.\n4. They Invest in Real-Estate Loans \u2014 and Earn 8.1% in Dividends\nLoaning people money and charging interest is one of the ways large institutions and the ultra-wealthy earn passive income. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s typically available to the average person.\nBut with the Arrived Private Credit Fund, you can invest in a portfolio of real-estate loans that pay dividends monthly \u2014 with a historic yield of 8.10% annualized dividends.\nArrived is a platform backed by Jeff Bezos, Marc Benioff, and other top-tier investors, with more than 800,000 registered users and nearly $300 million invested.\nHere\u2019s how it works: You\u2019ll invest in a diversified portfolio of loans across the U.S. that help fund renovations, rehabs, and new home construction. As borrowers pay the loan back, the interest is distributed among investors like you on a monthly basis. Historically, this has yielded investors 8.10% annualized dividends.\nWant to start earning passive income like the ultra-wealthy do? It\u2019s simple to get started here and see how much you could earn.\n5. They Get Up to $1,000 in Free Stock Just For Investing\nWhile your cash sits in a basic account doing absolutely nothing, smart investors are growing their wealth effortlessly \u2013 and getting up to $1,000 in free stock just for opening and funding a new SoFi Active Invest account.\nWhether you\u2019re new to investing or a seasoned pro, SoFi makes it easy to start, manage and grow your portfolio by investing in stocks, ETFs and even fractional shares, meaning you can own a slice of your favorite company without having to buy a full share.\nTraditional investing platforms charge fees that eat away at your gains. But with SoFi Active Invest, you keep more of what you earn: There are no commissions on stocks and ETFs, no account minimums and no hidden fees.\nIt takes just a few minutes to open an account. Get started here and fund your account within 30 days to earn up to $1,000.\n6. They Protect Their Portfolio With Precious Metals\nIf the past few years have shown us anything, it\u2019s that disruptions to the market can come out of nowhere. Between the pandemic, supply-chain issues and bear markets, a lot of people\u2019s retirement savings felt the impact.\nThat\u2019s why it can be a smart idea to look for ways to protect your retirement savings from the unpredictable. For a lot of people, investing in precious metals is a way to diversify and protect their investments.\nOne way to do this is with a precious metals IRA through a company like Priority Gold. Precious metals often outperform other investments in a volatile market, and their value tends to rise with inflation, making them an effective hedge during uncertain economic times.\nOpening a gold or silver IRA is easy, and you can roll over funds from existing retirement accounts without any taxes or penalty fees. Or you can buy gold and silver directly from Priority Gold\u2019s extensive collection.\nWorried you may need to sell your precious metals in the future? Priority Gold offers a no-fee buy-back program. Plus, Priority Gold has an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau.\nRight now, Priority Gold is offering up to $10,000 in free silver with qualifying purchases, and you\u2019ll get free account setup, free insured shipping and free storage for up to five years.\nWant to diversify and safeguard your investments by adding gold and silver to your portfolio? It\u2019s easy to get started here and get your free guide. Right now, Priority Gold is offering up to $20,000 in free silver on qualifying purchases.\n7. They Know You Can Get Matched with a Financial Advisor for Free\nEven the savviest millionaires don\u2019t know everything about money. But people who quietly build wealth know enough to know what they don\u2019t know \u2014 that sometimes, it takes an expert\u2019s insight to make the smartest financial decisions.\nBut the idea of getting a financial advisor sounds expensive and tedious. That\u2019s why we like a company called WiserAdvisor. They\u2019ll match you with a financial advisor in your area \u2014 for free.\nNo two people have the same financial situation, which is why WiserAdvisor matches you with the best financial advisor for your specific situation, so you get an expert in the areas you need.\nThere\u2019s no obligation to hire the advisor, and WiserAdvisor screens every advisor to make sure you\u2019re only getting matched with the best experts.\nWant to get a customized financial plan? Just start here to get matched with a financial advisor for free.\n8. They Know You Can Get $280/Year in Cash Back on Gas and Other Things You They Already Buy\nEver notice how so many rich people watch every penny like a hawk? They\u2019ll be the first to remind you about a coupon or a rebate offer. It seems strange, but that attention to detail is a big part of why they\u2019re successful in the first place. It\u2019s something any of us can do by using a free cash-back app like Upside.\nUpside pays you cash back when you fill up at the pump and buy other things you already need, like groceries and even meals at restaurants \u2014 frequent users earn an average of $280 per year.\nOnce you download and install the free app, just browse its more than 100,000 participating grocery stores, restaurants and best of all, gas stations, to find a cash-back offer near you. These are always changing, but we\u2019ve seen up to 24 cents back per gallon.\nClaim the offer you want and buy your items with your usual debit or credit card. After, check in with Upside to verify your purchase. Upside will verify your purchase and then add the cash back to your Upside account (this can take up three business days). Then you can cash out directly to your bank account, or via gift card.\nUpside pays its users $1 million each week, and the app has a 4.7 star rating from more than 250,000 reviews. When you download the free app right now, Upside will pay you an extra 25 cents per gallon on your first tank of gas. Hurry though, this offer expires soon. Get started to see how much cash back you can earn on gas, food and other things you already have to buy.\nBottom Line\nBuilding wealth on a middle-class income isn\u2019t about trying to hit it big; it\u2019s about making thoughtful decisions and putting your money to work for you. With the right tools, guidance, and the openness to making smart money moves, you can take meaningful steps toward achieving millionaire status.\n*Source: FDIC, national average of savings, week of 02/18/25.

GOBankingRates identified cities with a population of at least 150,000 and a population percentage of residents aged 65 and over of at least 10%. For each location, GOBankingRates found total population, population ages 65 and over, total households and household median income, all sourced from the U.S. Census American Community Survey. Using this data, the percentage of the population ages 65 and over was calculated. The cost-of-living indexes were sourced from Sperling\u2019s BestPlaces and include the grocery, healthcare, housing, utilities, transportation and miscellaneous cost-of-living indexes. Using the indexes and the national average expenditure costs for retired households, as sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey for retired households, the average expenditure cost for each location was calculated. The livability index was sourced from AreaVibes for each location and included as supplemental information to help determine the quality of life. The average single-family home value was sourced from Zillow Home Value Index for December 2024. Using the average home value, assuming a 10% down payment, and using the most recent national average 30-year fixed mortgage rate, as sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data, the average mortgage was calculated. Using the average mortgage and average expenditure costs, the average cost of living was calculated. The cities were sorted to show the cheapest total cost of living as well as the cheapest total expenditure costs. All data was collected on and is up to date as of Feb. 18, 2025.\nShare This Article:\nYou May Also Like\n70% of Gen Xers Say They Can't Afford To Retire -- They're Right If They Don't Do These 8 Things\nAugust 21, 2025\n7 min Read\nNearly 42% of Boomers Are Living Paycheck to Paycheck: Here's How It's Delaying Retirement\nAugust 21, 2025\n7 min Read\nHere's How Long $1 Million in Retirement Savings Will Last You After Age 65\nAugust 19, 2025\n7 min Read\nFor Boomers Closing in on Retirement: 5 Ways To Make Sure You're on Track\nAugust 19, 2025\n7 min Read\nI'm a Financial Expert: This Is the No. 1 Thing Every American Should Do With Their 401(k)\nAugust 19, 2025\n7 min Read\nHere's How You May Lose $18,100 in Social Security in 2033 and What To Do About It\nAugust 20, 2025\n7 min Read\n- How Long Will My Money Last?\n- How Much Do You Need To Retire?\n- How To Prepare For Retirement\n- How To Save For Retirement Without A 401K\nLearn More About Early Retirement Planning\nMake your money work for you\nGet the latest news on investing, money, and more with our free newsletter.\nThanks!\nSending you timely financial stories that you can bank on.\nSign up for our daily newsletter for the latest financial news and trending topics.\nFor our full Privacy Policy, click here.\nLooks like you're using an adblocker\nPlease disable your adblocker to enjoy the optimal web experience and access the quality content you appreciate from GOBankingRates.\n- AdBlock / uBlock / Brave\n- Click the ad blocker extension icon to the right of the address bar\n- Disable on this site\n- Refresh the page\n- Firefox / Edge / DuckDuckGo\n- Click on the icon to the left of the address bar\n- Disable Tracking Protection\n- Refresh the page\n- Ghostery\n- Click the blue ghost icon to the right of the address bar\n- Disable Ad-Blocking, Anti-Tracking, and Never-Consent\n- Refresh the page"

This number is way out of reach for many Americans, though, considering 28% of people recently told GOBankingRates that they had nothing saved and most of the rest don\u2019t have close to seven figures.\nAs big a chunk of change a $1 million sounds like, surprisingly it doesn\u2019t last quite as long as you might think it would \u2014 but that all depends on the state you live in when you retire.\nIf you live in one of the more expensive states, like Hawaii or New York, you\u2019ll want to work as long as possible and save as much money as possible because $1 million won\u2019t even cover your living expenses for 15 years. There is a bit more cushion in many Midwestern and Southern states, though, if you live there or planning a move.\nHawaii\n- Annual groceries cost: $6,463\n- Annual housing cost: $37,135\n- Annual

sourced from the U.S. Census American Community Survey \u2014 and used the Missouri Economic Research Information Center for grocery, healthcare, housing, utilities, transportation and miscellaneous cost-of-living indexes. Using the cost of living indexes and the national average expenditure costs for retired households, as sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey, the average expenditure cost for each location was calculated. The average single-family home value was sourced from Zillow Home Value Index for Feb. 27, 2025. Using the home value, assuming a 10% down payment, and using the most recent national average 30-year fixed mortgage rate, as sourced from the Federal Reserve Economic Data, the average mortgage was calculated. Using the average mortgage and average expenditure costs, the average cost of living was calculated. Assuming $1 million in retirement savings, the number of years to draw down was calculated. The states were sorted to show the shortest to longest years until your savings is depleted. All data was collected on and is up to date as of Feb. 27, 2025.\nShare This Article:\nYou May Also Like\n70% of Gen Xers Say They Can't Afford To Retire -- They're Right If They Don't Do These 8 Things\nAugust 21, 2025\n10 min Read\nNearly 42% of Boomers Are Living Paycheck to Paycheck: Here's How It's Delaying Retirement\nAugust 21, 2025\n10 min Read\nHere's How Long $1 Million in Retirement Savings Will Last You After Age 65\nAugust 19, 2025\n10 min Read\nFor Boomers Closing in on Retirement: 5 Ways To Make Sure You're on Track\nAugust 19, 2025\n10 min Read\nI'm a Financial Expert: This Is the No. 1 Thing Every American Should Do With Their 401(k)\nAugust 19, 2025\n10 min Read\n- How Long Will My Money Last?\n- How Much Do You Need To Retire?\n- How To Prepare For Retirement\n- How To Save For Retirement Without A 401K\nLearn More About Early Retirement Planning\nMake your money work for you\nGet the latest news on investing, money, and more with our free newsletter.\nThanks!\nSending you timely financial stories that you can bank on.\nSign up for our daily newsletter for the latest financial news and trending topics.\nFor our full Privacy Policy, click here.\nLooks like you're using an adblocker\nPlease disable your adblocker to enjoy the optimal web experience and access the quality content you appreciate from GOBankingRates.\n- AdBlock / uBlock / Brave\n- Click the ad blocker extension icon to the right of the address bar\n- Disable on this site\n- Refresh the page\n- Firefox / Edge / DuckDuckGo\n- Click on the icon to the left of the address bar\n- Disable Tracking Protection\n- Refresh the page\n- Ghostery\n- Click the blue ghost icon to the right of the address bar\n- Disable Ad-Blocking, Anti-Tracking, and Never-Consent\n- Refresh the page"

      "text": "A significant retirement crisis looms for many Americans, with seniors in 41 states and Washington, D.C., projected to outlive their savings and face an average shortfall of $115,000.\nOlder Americans in nearly every state are on track to outlive their retirement income and savings, a new analysis from Seniorly has found.\nAcross the U.S., older adults face an average gap of about $115,000 between what they\u2019re projected to spend during retirement and what they\u2019re likely to bring in from Social Security, savings, and investments. In 41 states and Washington, D.C., retirees are expected to fall short. Only nine states do seniors have enough of a financial cushion to fully cover their costs.\nThat\u2019s the alarming takeaway from a new Seniorly report on where seniors are most and least likely to outlive their savings. The findings come as the surging cost of living puts even more pressure on older adults living on fixed incomes and retirement plans.\nOlder adults are already bracing for the challenge. Today, more than half of Gen Xers and 40% of Baby Boomers expect to outlive their savings, according to a survey from Northwestern Mutual.\nModern retirement can easily last 20 or 30 years, yet the cost of housing, health care, food, and other essentials has climbed sharply \u2013 eroding the value of even well-planned nest eggs. A dollar doesn\u2019t stretch as far as it once did, and a single unexpected expense, like a medical emergency or major home repair, can throw off an otherwise solid financial plan.\nThe \u201cmagic number\u201d that Americans now think they need to retire is $1.26 million, Northwestern Mutual found. But in many places, even that may not be enough to guarantee peace of mind.\nIn some states, affordable living costs and modest expenses make it easier to stretch savings and maintain a decent quality of life. In others, high prices can drain those savings long before a person\u2019s needs begin to decline.\nTo understand how retirement readiness varies by location, Seniorly analyzed where older adults are most and least likely to outlive their savings. Using the latest available data on life expectancy at age 65, Social Security income, household net worth, and cost-of-living metrics, we estimated how far seniors\u2019 financial resources are likely to stretch over a typical retirement in each state. More details are included in the methodology below.\nThe results reveal sharp geographic divides, and highlight where older Americans are best positioned to age with financial security.\nIn this report, a positive cushion means retirees in that state, on average, have enough income and assets to cover their expected expenses. A negative number signals a likely shortfall, with seniors at greater risk of outliving their financial resources.\nSome states pose big challenges for retirees. New York, ranked 51st overall, tops the list for the toughest financial outlook, with seniors facing a huge gap of $448,000 between what they\u2019ll need and what they\u2019re expected to have. That\u2019s because while New York is one of the most expensive states for seniors (they\u2019ll need $1.12 million to cover living expenses over 19.4 years of expected retirement) they can expect to collect just $670,000 between retirement benefits, savings, and other investments.\nNo. 50 Hawaii and No. 49 Washington, D.C., also rank among the worst, with seniors also facing major shortfalls ($417,000 and and $407,000, respectively) due to sky-high living costs. Rounding out the bottom five are No. 48 Alaska and No. 47 California, where expenses like housing and healthcare put a heavy strain on retirement savings.\nIn some states, retirees have a strong financial edge. No. 1 Washington tops the list, with seniors enjoying a healthy cushion of about $146,000 between what they\u2019re projected to earn and what they\u2019ll need to spend. That\u2019s thanks to a combination of a high retirement income ($1.13 million) and expenses that, while not the lowest, are still manageable compared to many other high-earning states.\nNo. 2 Utah follows closely, with seniors expected to have a surplus of about $121,000 \u2013 another example of strong incomes (about $994,000) paired with moderate living costs ($873,000). No. 3 Montana, No. 4 Colorado, and No. 5 Iowa also land in the top five. Montana retirees have a projected financial cushion of about $43,000, while those in Colorado and Iowa enjoy smaller but still meaningful surpluses of around $38,000 and $32,000, respectively.\nThese top-ranked states show how retirees can fare best when decent nest eggs are matched with a cost of living that doesn't eat away at every dollar. In these places, seniors are less likely to face the stress of running out of money later in life.\nRetirement income isn't just about Social Security \u2013 it also reflects how much seniors have managed to save. Despite its poor overall ranking, seniors in No. 50 Hawaii actually have the biggest financial cushion in the country, with a projected income of $1.32 million over their retirement years.\nSeniors in No. 1 Washington, No. 46 Massachusetts and No. 7 Maryland can also expect to bring in at least $1 million in their golden years, underscoring that wealth does not guarantee financial security once expenses are factored in.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, seniors in No. 43 Louisiana and No. 40 Mississippi have the smallest nest eggs, with projected retirement incomes of just $479,000 and $488,000, respectively. No. 35 West Virginia, No. 41 Arkansas and No. 36 Alabama are also near the bottom, with projected incomes of $526,000 or below.\nRetirement costs can make a big difference in how far savings stretch, and some states are far more affordable than others.\nNo. 50 Hawaii is the most expensive place to retire, with seniors facing projected lifetime expenses of $1.74 million. Meanwhile No. 46 Massachusetts and No. 47 California aren\u2019t far behind, with estimated expenses of $1.31 million and $1.26 million, respectively. These high costs reflect the steep price tags on housing, healthcare, and everyday essentials.\nOn the opposite end, No. 25 Oklahoma and No. 40 Mississippi offer the most affordable retirements, both with projected expenses below $650,000. No. 8 Kansas hit the sweet spot, with total retirement costs coming in around $746,000 \u2013 but expected income even higher.\nThese states help show how location alone can influence whether seniors are likely to outlive their savings, even without major differences in income.\nNo matter where you live, preparing for retirement requires more than just saving. It means thinking ahead to anticipate your needs, costs, and lifestyle. Here are a few ways to stay ahead of the curve:\nWhether you're planning for your own future or helping a loved one make smart choices, understanding trends in cost of living and finances can make a real difference in the ability to age with peace of mind, independence, and dignity. For those weighing options for retirement or long-term care, location matters more than ever.\nTo determine where seniors are most and least likely to outlive their savings, we analyzed the latest available data across a range of economic and demographic indicators.\nFirst, we used state-level life expectancy at age 65 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) to estimate how many years seniors are likely to spend in retirement. We then calculated expected retirement income over those years, combining average annual retirement benefits (Social Security Administration) with median net worth, including financial assets and retirement account savings (Census Bureau).\nFor a few states where median net worth data wasn\u2019t available, we used the national average net worth of $176,500. We also adjusted median household net worth for seniors to reflect that typical senior households hold about 80% more net worth than the national average household, based on Census data. We included home equity in net worth calculations to account for assets that seniors may opt to sell to help cover their retirements.\nTo estimate expected retirement expenses, we started with seniors\u2019 average spending on essentials like housing, groceries, transportation, and healthcare across the U.S. (Bureau of Labor Statistics), then adjusted these figures for each state\u2019s cost of living (Missouri Economic Research and Information Center). This gave us a realistic picture of how much seniors are likely to spend annually in each state.\nBy comparing projected income with projected spending over their expected remaining years, we identified which states give seniors the best chance of covering their retirement \u2013 and where they are most at risk of outliving their savings under current economic conditions.\nChristine Healy is the Chief Growth Officer at Seniorly, a senior living technology company.

  "argos_summary": "A Seniorly analysis finds that 41 states and Washington, D.C. will see seniors outliving their savings, with an average shortfall of $115,000. New\u202fYork tops the list, projecting a $448,000 gap, while only nine states offer a surplus. The report highlights the need for better planning\u2014using calculators, adjusting for personal expenses, optimizing Social Security timing, building emergency funds, and possibly relocating to lower\u2011cost states. It also notes that many retirees rely on Social Security alone, which typically covers only 40% of pre\u2011retirement income, and that unexpected costs and rising healthcare can further erode savings.",
