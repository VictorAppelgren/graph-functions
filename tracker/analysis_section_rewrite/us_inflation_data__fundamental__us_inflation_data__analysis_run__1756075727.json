      "feedback": "The critique below targets a world‑class, multi‑year FIRST‑PRINCIPLES framework and a rigorous regime/causality mapping; your draft succeeds on macro framing but falls short on (i) a formal, multi‑year regime map with explicit transition conditions, (ii) a tight, first‑principles chain from inflation/monetary policy to sector pricing, (iii) stock‑level catalysts, invalidation triggers, and quantified baselines drawn from the cited sources, and (iv) full coverage and reconciliation of the five target names with their exact metrics and targets. Actionable edits in one compact paragraph: build a 3‑regime macromodel (Baseline: gradual Fed easing as CPI stays near 0.2% MoM / 2–3% YoY; Hawkish Pivot: inflation surprise prompts delay/ reversal of cuts; Full‑on Tight: inflation reaccelerates and policy tightens). Tie each regime to invariant anchors (real‑rate differentials, policy reaction functions, sector ROIC/cash‑flow discipline) and to a causal chain: inflation data → rate expectations → discount rate/multiples → sector cash‑flow valuation. Quantify from sources: BTSG shows 17.4% five‑year revenue growth and 26.3% EPS CAGR with solid FCF; GMED 28.6% five‑year revenue growth and strong FCF; IQVIA 7.5% five‑year growth with 12–13% long‑term EPS growth and 12–13% FCF margin; INSP 60.3% five‑year revenue growth but near‑term GAAP loss and Inspire V transition; XRAY weak top‑line growth with negative five‑year ROIC; NEOG/UFPT/CNMD/ACHC each bring divergent cash/ROIC signals; anchor these with concrete figures (ROIC, FCF margins, EV/FCF or P/E implied targets) from StockStory/StockStory updates and the BTSG/GMED/INSP/IQVIA/Dentsply Sirona/SVG family blocks in the supplied sources. Map explicit near‑term catalysts/triggers per name (e.g., INSP: Q2 revenue $217.1m, GAAP loss, Inspire V delay; BTSG: Q2 revenue $3.15b, FCF positive; GMED: 18.4% YoY growth with 21–23% EBITDA margin; IQVIA: 4Q‑ish beat and guidance reaffirmation; UFPT: 37.2% YoY growth in Q2; NEOG: 4.8% YoY revenue with impairment drag; XRAY: 4Q2 EPS beat but −13.7% margin; CNMD: 3.1% top‑line with 11.1% margin; MD: 7% YoY revenue with 15–22% EBITDA beat). Attach a trigger/invalidation rubric (e.g., if 12‑month forward ROIC trends decline by >2–3pp or FCF margin stays <5% for 2 consecutive quarters, or debt/EBITDA >4.0x persistently, or a policy shock changes Medicare/ERI reimbursements, or CPI surprises >50bp). For the base case, quantify the pricing/valuation channel: with a regime of easing policy, high‑quality healthcare names tend to re‑rate on durable FCF and ROIC (cite BTSG, GMED, IQVIA as examples of durable cash/scale). Include explicit targets from the sources to anchor the base case and potential upside/downside (e.g., BTSG target 28.71, GMED 82.36, IQVIA 213.05, INSP 145.50, CNMD 61, XRAY 16.93, MD 16.64, ICUI 182.80, TMO 551.81). Ensure every factual claim has a source tag (BB0T3MZGU, S3OU19RRO, 8R1EDX6F3, 2QRLB974F, 1GVYF2V8O) and reconcile conflicts by presenting a short, explicit weighting: e.g., BTSG/GMED/IQVIA dominate on cash flow and ROIC; NEOG/XRAY lag on profitability; UFPT remains niche but with strong EPS momentum; MD/CNMD/CNMD fall into “value traps” per StockStory framing. Tighten the causal chain by removing generic statements, replacing them with the explicit numbers and regime logic above, and reframe the conclusion to a stated base case, clear risks (policy/ inflation surprises, ROIC erosion, debt burden), and a concise watch list (quarterly FCF, ROIC stabilization, forward guidance revisions). End with a crisp note on confidence: moderate, contingent on inflation trajectory and policy timing, with explicit invalidation criteria.",
