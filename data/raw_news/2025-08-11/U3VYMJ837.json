  "content": "EsadeGeo: Esade\u2019s Center for Global Economy and Geopolitics produces applied research and provides advanced tools for integrating geopolitical and geoeconomic analysis into strategic, financial, and operational decisions. Nearly all tailored programs begin with a geopolitical environment and scenario analysis.\n\nGeopolitics, Economics & Risk: Launching in November 2025, this program is a highly specialized program for senior executives and board members responsible for strategy, finance, risk, or international operations. Participants learn to identify, map, and prioritize political and economic risks across their markets and integrate this analysis into decision-making.\n\nMaster Degrees: Its Executive Master degrees include geopolitical scenario methodology and strategic reflections on how global developments might affect value chains and geographic markets. Its Master of Science Programs have a mandatory Geopolitics and Non-Market Strategy course that trains students to respond strategically to forces beyond the market.\n\nMBA: Core course Business, Government and Society examines nonmarket strategy in areas such as energy markets, geopolitics, and climate governance. The elective Geopolitical Scenarios and Business teaches scenario planning to prepare leaders for multiple possible futures.\n\n\u201cWhile a few years ago we had to make the case to students that global politics and geopolitics were important for firms, today this hardly requires any justification. Daily news on geopolitical and policy elements affecting firms prove so: tariffs, regulatory barriers, export restrictions, industrial policy, sanctions and so forth.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, in most of the courses or specific programmes that we tailor, we always start by analysing geopolitical environments and scenarios. There is a growing demand for everything related to geopolitical scenarios,\u201d says Professor \u00c1ngel Saz, director of EsadeGeo.\n\nAs a business school, Esade was an early mover into geopolitics. It founded EsadeGeo in 2010 under the leadership of Javier Solana, former NATO Secretary General and EU High Representative for Common Security and Defense Policy. Today, EsadeGeo faculty teach across the school\u2019s programs, emphasizing how global politics, markets, and nonmarket forces shape corporate strategy.\n\nMBAs, executives, and business students at every level want more than strategy and finance, they want the tools to navigate a volatile global order. Across Europe and Canada, a growing number of business schools are answering that call. From full-blown Schools of Governance to topical exec ed courses, these schools are making geopolitics central to business education. (See: A New Geopolitics Push? How International B-Schools Are Responding To Global Chaos )\n\n\u201cBusiness leaders cannot ignore the interconnected nature of the global economy and the effect of these interconnections across the value chain of their companies,\u201d says Lee Newman, dean of IE Business School in Spain.\n\nIn 2025, politics is inescapable for business leaders. Wars and power plays disrupt supply chains, tariffs appear and vanish overnight, and rules for emerging technologies shift before the ink is dry.\n\nWhy is this moment particularly urgent for business leaders? The most urgent topic today is the creation of a new consensus on international trade relations and state intervention of markets. We currently are in a space where different geopolitical actors do not agree on what constitutes fair trade and legitimate economic policies. Until this new consensus is reached, volatility and uncertainty derived from geopolitics will endure.\u201d\n\nDo you believe geopolitics is more relevant to business education now than in years past? Definitely. The weakening of international institutions (World trade organization, Free trade agreements\u2026) and their ability to set rules and enforce them makes geopolitics much more timely and relevant today than before. If institutions are lacking, power becomes the main approach to settle decisions and disputes among international actors.\n\nIMD has integrated geopolitics and security risk across its degree portfolio, spurred by a recognition that space between commercial strategy and geopolitics is gone. Its own research found that geopolitical factors were cited in 75% of 2023 corporate filings to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, while harmful trade barriers have doubled since 2020.\n\n\u201cProtectionism is now the American default, not a Trump-era detour,\u201d says Professor Richard Baldwin, an expert in globalization and trade economics.\n\nThe school has researched global competitiveness and economic security for more than 35 years, beginning with the World Competitiveness Yearbook launched in 1989. The center leads pioneering research on how nations and enterprises compete, creating several practical tools to help leaders assess geopolitical threats, including its \u201cGeopolitical Radar and Sonar\u201d framework and the Hinrich-IMD Sustainable Trade Index.\n\nIts faculty also brings decades of experience in political economy, trade policy, and global competitiveness. They include David Bach, IMD President, an expert in political economy and business-government relations and an architect of Global Network for Advanced Management; Professor Arturo Bris, director of the World Competitiveness Center since 2014; Richard Baldwin, a trade economist and globalization scholar; Simon Evenett, former co-chair of the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Future Council on Trade and Investment\n\u2022 From Blind Spots to Insights: Enhancing Geopolitical Radar to Guide Global Business: A 2025 report produced with the World Economic Forum and Boston Consulting Group with frameworks for companies to track and assess geopolitical dynamics.\n\u2022 Exec ed: In the first half of 2025 alone, it has developed 10 customized geopolitical programs for senior leadership teams. In open programs, the 2025 \u201cGeopolitics Series: Navigating America\u2019s New Direction\u201d explores U.S. policy shifts, while \u201cBoards and Risks\u201d trains board members on geopolitical resilience. Its flagship Orchestrating Winning Performance program was offered in both Switzerland and Singapore with the theme: \u201cThrive globally in a fragmented world.\u201d\n\u2022 MBA, EMBA, Executive Master\u2019s: Geopolitics and economic security embedded across IMD\u2019s degree portfolio, including into core strategy, operations, and leadership coursework. The EMBA leads immersions in China, Japan, and Singapore. Coursework includes case studies on U.S.-China trade, European energy security, and supply chain vulnerabilities. Two newly released programs \u2013 Executive Masters in Sustainable Business Transformation and AI & Digital Business Transformation \u2013 also embed geopolitical analysis.\n\nMISIEK PISKORSKI, DEAN OF EXECUTIVE EDUCATION AND PROFESSOR OF DIGITAL STRATEGY, ANALYTICS AND INNOVATION\n\nDo you believe geopolitics is more relevant to business education now than in years past? At IMD, we\u2019ve been tracking geopolitics, national competitiveness, and economic security for over 35 years. While recent events like the Trump administration\u2019s policies on DEI, international students, and higher education have made these dynamics highly visible, the underlying trends have been building for decades. Our research has documented the gradual shift from multilateralism to economic nationalism, the weaponization of trade policy, and the increasing fragmentation of global markets. This long-term perspective has been crucial\u2014we\u2019ve observed how geopolitical rivalries have steadily intensified since the 2008 financial crisis, with trade barriers doubling between 2020 and today. What appears sudden to many observers represents the culmination of structural changes over years.\n\nHaving said all of this, the current moment feels particularly urgent because multiple long-term trends are converging simultaneously with immediate policy actions. Trump\u2019s tariff policies, restrictions on international talent mobility, and attacks on institutional cooperation aren\u2019t isolated events\u2014they\u2019re accelerating existing patterns of deglobalization and economic fragmentation that our faculty have been analyzing. Similarly, while the U.S. may be slowing progress on energy transition and imposing severe restrictions on diversity initiatives, our clients outside the U.S. continue to demand leadership in these areas. This is why we remain committed to developing inclusive leaders and accelerating the energy transition.\n\nESCP\u2019s Paris Campus is one of six ESCP European campuses. It also has a branch campus in Dubai. Courtesy photo\n\nTo create its new strategic plan, \u201cBold & United,\u201d ESCP Business School surveyed 4,000 students, alumni, industry and other stakeholders to form its future priorities.\n\n\u201cWhen we asked what should come next \u2013 beyond our existing focus on sustainability and biodiversity \u2013 they pointed to two key areas. First, emerging technologies like AI. The second was geopolitics,\u201d says L\u00e9on Laulusa, executive president and dean of ESCP.\n\n\u201cThat was consistent with our broader strategic studies, which indicate that geopolitics will remain a defining issue for the next 40 to 50 years.\u201d\n\nThe new plan launched in June \u2013 a time when U.S. business schools and universities faced increasing political attacks against DEI, international students, and academic autonomy. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s tariffs continue to disrupt trade around the world, while wars in Ukraine, the Middle East, and elsewhere rage on.\n\nThe plan\u2019s response is the creation of a new university altogether: The European University of Management will be developed by 2030 and will include a new ESCP School of Governance, launching in 2029.\n\u2022 ESCP Geopolitics Institute: Launched in 2024, is supported by scholars and professionals specializing in geopolitics, geo-economics, and European integration.\n\u2022 ESCP School of Governance (launching 2029): Focused on geopolitics, global affairs, and defense studies, this new school is part of the reorganization of ESCP Business School into a new European University of Management. The university will include three schools \u2013 Governance, ESCP School of Technology (launching 2027), and ESCP Business School acting as its \u201cacademic heart.\u201d\n\u2022 Executive Master in Strategy & Defense Studies (launching 2026): ESCP is working with the the French military, economic agencies, and industry to create the degree.\n\u2022 MSc in International Business and Diplomacy: Launched three years ago, the objective is to train graduates on the \u201clogic and rules of economic diplomacy, and to understand the interactions between governments, firms and other non-state actors.\u201d\n\nIs the goal here primarily to help business leaders navigate global business, or are you also preparing students for roles in government and public service? Both. Even in our Master in Management program, we already offer a specialization in public affairs. Through that, our students can go on to work in NGOs, international organizations, or various ministries, and become high-level civil servants.\n\nBut we want to go further. It\u2019s not only about helping business leaders decode the world and understand the impact of geopolitics on business. It\u2019s also about preparing future leaders for roles in international organizations, government, and the public sector. So this goes beyond just a discipline, it\u2019s about training for real-world positions in public leadership and governance.\n\nAt Cambridge Judge, geopolitics is taught as inseparable from business. The school\u2019s approach is anchored in its network of research centers which informs curriculum at all academic levels in geopolitical issues.\n\nThese centers host global conferences and produce research on topics from accelerated innovation in China to economic risks from political upheaval. The Centre for Financial Reporting & Accountability also convenes the Cambridge Disinformation Summit, bringing together senior policymakers and scholars to address systemic information risks.\n\nMeanwhile, the school\u2019s accounting subject group is leading global dialogue and learning on systemic global business information risks, including direct engagement with the highest levels of government in the EU, the UK, Brazil and other regions.\n\n\u201cMany of our students come to Cambridge Judge because they want to do societally impactful projects like clean energy or developing economies in impoverished communities. However, when I interview degree candidates, almost none of them have considered the likely headwinds they will face engaging these business projects in the current global geopolitical climate,\u201d says Alan Jagolinzer, professor of financial accounting and Vice-Dean for Programs.\n\n\u201cAlso, few have a sense of the power of their own voice in potentially influencing change in global policy. So I think we have an obligation and an opportunity to support and elevate their impact\u2014to bring the light, if you will\u2014to this seemingly dark environment.\u201d\n\u2022 MBA: A new module, Geopolitics and Financial Regulation, explores how political tensions, conflicts, and shifting alliances affect the financial sector. Students analyze trade wars, sanctions, digital currencies, blockchain, and divergent ESG policies through the lens of regulatory and market infrastructure. The module equips graduates with analytic frameworks for navigating these developments in an organizational setting.\n\u2022 Cambridge Disinformation Summit (annual): Hosted by the Centre for Financial Reporting & Accountability, it brings together interdisciplinary scholars and policymakers to examine the efficacy of interventions to mitigate the harms from disinformation. The first was in July 2023 while the second was in April 2025.\n\u2022 Electives & Executive Education: Faculty teach on emerging economies, frugal innovation, and systemic risk in both the MBA and MPhil in Technology Policy programs, as well as in executive education. Curriculum on business risks and responsibilities will be integrated into multiple graduate and executive programs by 2026\u20132027.\n\u2022 Geopolitical research centers: Numerous research centers focus on geopolitical topics, including the Centre for Chinese Management, Circular Economy Centre, Centre for India and Global Business, and Centre for Risk Studies.\n\nWhy do you believe geopolitics belongs in a business school setting? Money and influence move policy. Business has always shaped global policy and it has been particularly acute from business influencers in energy, banking, and tech industries. Geopolitics and business are not separable\u2014they are extensions of each other.\n\nDo you believe geopolitics is more relevant to business education now than in years past? Yes. In prior years, U.S. administrations had a more business-supportive approach to policy. Now, policy seems to be more administrative-supportive, despite the negative global systemic shocks that are destroying value in businesses.\n\nAs part of the Global Manager Initiative course, Toronto-Rotman students supported Canadian companies on a trade mission at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in March 2025. Another 16 MBAs and 8 Canadian companies will attend the IAA Mobility Conference in Munich.\n\nRotman students can combine global affairs and business in one of the school\u2019s most distinctive offerings: the Master of Global Affairs/Master of Business Administration (MGA/MBA). In three years, students earn two professional degrees \u2014 one from the Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy and one from Rotman \u2014 building the ability to bring a business perspective to global policy challenges, and vice versa.\n\nThe school\u2019s Institute for International Business anchors much of its global strategy work. The institute conducts research on global market trends, cross-cultural management, international finance, trade policy, and multinational strategy. It also provides experiential learning through study abroad programs, consulting projects, and industry partnerships, as well as outreach through conferences, executive education, and collaborations with business and government.\n\u2022 MGA/MBA: Integrates business and policy perspectives, preparing graduates to navigate complex global systems from boardrooms to diplomatic forums.\n\n Institute for International Business: Through IIB\u2019s research and outreach programs, students learn to navigate a rapidly changing global environment, connecting classroom learning to real-world application in both public and private sectors.\n\u2022 MBA: Rotman offers several electives with various geopolitical focuses. Examples: Business Government Relations, taught by former Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau, explores U.S.-Canada relations, trade tensions, and business responses.Economic Environment of International Business, led by trade expert Daniel Trefler, covers Trump tariffs, trade agreements, the WTO, and negotiating with China. And International Business in the World Economy builds understanding of comparative advantage and the challenges of international trade for Canadian companies.\n\u2022 Global Manager Initiative: After students complete International Business in the World Economy, they can then partner with a Canadian company to develop a global strategy. The collaboration culminates in a government-led trade mission, where students and companies implement their plans in global markets. Recent missions have taken students to CES in Las Vegas and Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. Next month, 16 Rotman MBAs and eight Canadian companies are going to Munich for the IAA Mobility Conference.\n\nRecognizing that business decisions are increasingly shaped by geopolitics forces \u2013 trade tensions, regulatory shifts, conflict and war \u2013 ESSEC created the Institute for Geopolitics & Business to help navigate the complexity.\n\n\u201cBusiness cannot be separated from its (geo)political environment. Leaders need to understand power dynamics, geopolitical risks, and regional strategies to make informed decisions and sustain their competitive advantage,\u201d says Vincenzo Vinzi, Dean and President of ESSEC.\n\nLaunched in 2024 as part of its 2024-2028 Transcend Strategy, the institute builds on ESSEC\u2019s long-standing expertise by bringing together the work of three other centers: IRENE Centre for Negotiation and Mediation was founded in 1996 and has worked in 82 countries. The Center for European Law and Economics was established in 2008 while the Center for Geopolitics, Defense & Leadership in 2021.\n\nThrough these centers, ESSEC delivers research-based insights, practitioner engagement, and elective tracks for students.\n\u2022 Master in Management (MIM): Over 300 students enroll in elective tracks with a strong geopolitical component, including International Negotiation, Defense, and European Affairs. Popular electives cover geopolitics, defense, and China\u2019s political economy.\n\u2022 Institute for Geopolitics & Business: The institute hosts high-profile events such as a round table with French and German ministers for European Affairs and webinars like Securing Critical Minerals: Geopolitics, Economics, and Sustainability in a New Age of Resource Competition.\n\u2022 Executive Education: Custom and open-enrollment programs prepare leaders to navigate geopolitical shocks. The Institute emphasizes analytical rigor, global awareness, and practical tools for corporate strategy under uncertainty.\n\nDo you believe geopolitics is more relevant to business education now than in years past? Yes, absolutely. We\u2019ve entered a \u201cpost-globalization\u201d era, characterized by increased uncertainty, predation of resources, bloc competition, supply chain vulnerabilities, and technological rivalries. Business leaders, whatever their industries or expertises, must anticipate shifts that traditional market analysis alone cannot capture.\n\nWhat challenges do you think the next generation of business leaders will face that make this kind of education essential? They will face systemic uncertainties: climate crises, cyber threats, resource conflicts, and shifting global alliances. Understanding these forces is critical to developing resilient, responsible strategies, and making informed and relevant decisions to generate value in the long run.\n\nThis June, EDHEC launched its new Chair of Geopolitics and Business Strategy to prepare future leaders for a volatile global environment. It is co-directed by retired French Air and Space Force General Luc de Rancourt and director of Management Education Ma\u00eflys Vicaire. The chair aims to give all EDHEC students, from BBA to executives, core skills in geopolitical awareness, scenario planning, and strategic foresight.\n\nThe chair will develop programs, events, and more to teach students analytical reasoning and decision-making based on complex geopolitical scenarios. It will emphasize critical thinking skills to identify risks and opportunities in a volatile world as a competitive advantage as well as transforming challenges into opportunities through ethical leadership and informed decision-making.\n\nDe Rancourt draws on nearly 40 years in the military, from the Gulf War to Afghanistan, NATO missions, and senior defense leadership roles. He sees geopolitics not just as a risk lens, but as a source of opportunity for businesses prepared to act with foresight. \u201cPower politics and economic dynamics will shape the world and the future,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cYou cannot separate these issues. Leaders must understand the global environment in which they will develop their activity.\u201d\n\u2022 Chair of Geopolitics and Business Strategy: Launched in June 2025, students will learn to identify both risks and opportunities, aligning with EDHEC\u2019s strategic plan, Generations 2050. The chair is developing modules to integrate geopolitical thinking into all EDHEC programs. It will also offer CEO and academic lectures to build critical thinking and prospective strategy exercises simulating crises such as supply chain disruptions from a Taiwan conflict.\n\u2022 Pre-Master Geopolitics Module: Beginning next year, all 700 pre-master students will take a dedicated geopolitics module, introducing them to the strategic dynamics shaping today\u2019s world.\n\u2022 GETT Programs: Special interventions for students in EDHEC\u2019s two Global Economic and Technological Transformations programs, tailored to the geopolitical dimensions of innovation, trade, and global governance.\n\u2022 Program development: Targeted sessions for the E-MBA, Global MBA, and custom corporate programs, blending geopolitical analysis with decision-making under pressure. Participants learn to assess risk, identify opportunity, and develop resilient strategies in volatile environments.\n\nWhat is the Chair\u2019s core mission? The idea behind the chair is to provide the students with the skills which will help them to navigate within a very troubled world. I don\u2019t want the chair to be something which see geopolitics as risks. It is\u2026 a matter of opportunity, and our motto for the chair is, anticipate, act, do not suffer.\n\nWhat makes 2025 such a pivotal year in geopolitics? We are facing a fragmentation of the world: The end of the unipolar world and the rise of the competition between China and the US, the threat that the Russians are posing to Europe and the conflict in Ukraine, and ongoing conflict in the Middle East \u2026 Power politics and economic dynamics will shape the world and will shape the future. You cannot separate those issues, and therefore you need to make sure that the future business leaders at least understand the global environment in which they will develop their activity.\n\nHEC Paris has been teaching the intersection of geopolitics, globalization, and business strategy for more than a decade, well before recent crises pushed the topic into the spotlight. But Jeremy Ghez, Professor of Economics and International Affairs, has noticed an uptick in geopolitical offerings by European business schools.\n\nGhez sees several reasons for the trend. One, he says, is that Europeans tend to see warning signs earlier than their American counterparts \u2014 a reflex shaped by history and a more cautious outlook. With geopolitical crises and political upheavals often unfolding closer to home, European schools may be quicker to anticipate disruptions and adapt their programs in response.\n\nSecond, he points to an organizational difference between US and European business schools. US schools are usually embedded within larger universities, with built-in access to political science, history, and other social science departments. In Europe, standalone business schools like HEC must make a deliberate choice to integrate these perspectives into business education, creating dedicated initiatives and partnerships rather than relying on cross-campus collaborations.\n\nHEC Paris does this somewhat differently. Rather than relying solely on inviting diplomats to address students, the school focuses on what Ghez calls an \u201cobsession\u201d with the so what question, connecting global politics to concrete business strategy. The school\u2019s programming bridges business and geopolitics through electives, core MBA and Executive MBA courses, and public events.\n\u2022 EMBA: Business Environment core blends country risk with a systems-level view, examining how climate change, technology, polarization, and global policy shifts impact strategy.\n\u2022 MBA: Electives range from traditional country risk analysis to systemic analysis, where students assess how forces beyond the market\u2014geopolitical or otherwise\u2014shape corporate outcomes.\n\u2022 Geopolitics, Globalization & Business Strategy: This summer school program for young students has run for 10 years, introducing younger participants to geopolitical risk and its business implications.\n\u2022 Business Strategy in a Fragmenting World: Firms, States, and Civil Society: On June 2, 2025, HEC Paris and IRSEM (the French Ministry of Armed Forces\u2019 strategic research institute) co-hosted this international conference. It brought together economists, executives, geopolitical analysts, and policymakers to examine how global firms can operate in a world fracturing along political, technological, and moral lines.\n\nWhat challenges do you think the next generation of business leaders will face that make this kind of education essential? \u201cWe are in the most acute information and governance crisis in my lifetime. People do not know what is real and what is fake\u2026 I have never seen a more acute need for this type of education, and we need to deploy it urgently.\u201d\n\nWhy is HEC Paris integrating geopolitics into its business curriculum now? \u201cWe are in the business of helping executives and executives in the making better understand risk, and unless we fully understand that very multifaceted aspect of risk, then we\u2019re not doing our job.\u201d\n\nLee Newman, Dean of IE Business School, with students at IE Tower, the tech and sustainable campus of IE University in Madrid.\n\nAt IE, Strategic Foresight is a central pillar of leadership. Lee Newman, dean of IE Business School, defines it this way: \u201cThe ability to analyze, understand, and predict forces of disruption in the environment in which business happens, and to navigate these forces through sound decision-making.\u201d Disruptors include armed conflicts, changes in international trade, climate change, and others. Business leaders must both react to these forces and anticipate their effects.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we treat geopolitics as a core dimension of business strategy,\u201d Newman says.\n\nThe business school works closely with the IE School of Politics, Economics & Global Affairs to design and deliver Strategic Foresight content across all its programs. It also collaborates with key research centers including the IE Center for the Governance of Change (CGC) and the IE Transatlantic Relations Initiative (TRI).\n\u2022 IE Brown Executive MBA: Strategic Foresight is one of three core pillars. Leaders apply contextual intelligence to strategize for global forces reshaping business, from AI and geopolitics to economics, social movements, climate, and emerging technologies.\n\u2022 Global Executive MBA (GXMBA): A distinctive Board Leadership Module prepares current and future board members for global complexities, including a full course on \u201cStrategic Foresight and Scenario Planning.\u201d It also integrates geopolitics and Strategic Foresight throughout core and elective courses such as \u201cEconomic Environment and Country Analysis\u201d and \u201cGlobal Operations & Supply Management.\u201d Students also take a week-long immersion, \u201cOxford \u2013 Foresight in Times of Uncertainty,\u201d developed by IE\u2019s Center for the Governance of Change (CGC)and the University of Oxford.\n\u2022 International MBA, Master in Management (MIM): Offers a full concentration in Strategic Foresight and International Business. Electives include courses like \u201cCorporate Strategies in a Globalized World,\u201d \u201cStrategic Foresight: Navigating Uncertainty,\u201d and \u201cInternational Strategy Simulation.\u201d\n\u2022 BBA: Electives in Strategic Foresight and geopolitics introduce tools like scenario planning, systems thinking, and real options analysis. It is developing a new dual-degree, BBA and Political Science.\n\nWhat challenges do you think the next generation of business leaders will face that make this kind of education essential? The geopolitical battle for dominance of game-changing technologies like AI and quantum computing, access to key natural resources used to power and build these new technologies, the threat of bio-warfare, the continuing rise of conflict in the cybersphere, and the drive for pre-eminence in space travel.\n\nAt IE Business School, our approach is both reactive and proactive. Reactive: On one hand, today\u2019s business leaders must contend with crises that transcend borders\u2014conflict, trade disruption, rising nationalism, and contested globalization\u2014which have undermined traditional planning cycles. And Proactive: we believe leadership today demands anticipatory thinking. That\u2019s why we treat geopolitics as a core dimension of business strategy.\n\nLeaders need to interpret the signals of global change and make decisions that are not just responsive, but forward-looking. We are increasingly incorporating courses or larger curricular elements on Strategic Foresight into our programs.\n\nDON\u2019T MISS: A NEW GEOPOLITICS PUSH?

      "text": "Geopolitics, globalization and Business Strategy\nSummer Program\nThis Summer Program allows participants to broaden their horizons and consider how what happens beyond the market can affect their activities.\nWhen?\nOn-Campus: June 30 - July 11 Summer 2025.\nApplications will open in December for Summer 2026.\nPre-register your interest for 2026\nWe also offer an abridged online version of this program.\nThe next session will run throughout the month of November 2025.\nFor more details on dates, content and delivery, click below.\nWHY THIS SUMMER PROGRAM?\nUnderstand how political, geopolitical, economic, technological, societal and climate forces (among others!) shape the global business environment - as well as how coming turbulences, like AI or climate change, may be shifting the rules of the game for business and beyond.\nThis program will help you bridge the news headlines with what you'll need to do in the workplace to successfully shape your business strategy.\n- Earn an HEC Paris Certificate following successful completion of the program.\n- Created and taught by leading HEC Paris Professor\n- Real life cases based on current geopolitical and geostrategic issues\n- Accessible to students of all backgrounds who wish to integrate global political and macroeconomic issues into their thinking\n- Unparalleled opportunity to collaborate with diverse peers as part of student work groups\n- Real life experience: final presentation to jury of renowned professionals.\nThis summer program is taught via blended learning. Pre-recorded sessions introduce participants to key concepts and principles to study at your own pace. This allows greater flexibility to maximize the experience on and off campus and respond to your personal study rhythm. In-person sessions take your learning to the next level through interactions with the professor and peers from around the world.\nOVERVIEW\nIn recent years, instability in the Middle East, the rise of populism and protectionism in the United States and in Europe and growing tensions in the South China Sea, among other crises, have reminded us of how relevant political and geopolitical risks remain for decision-makers, including those of the private sector. What seemed to be solid assumptions about how the world worked and how stable it was are now continuously challenged by events \u2013 predictable and unpredictable \u2013that can unfold very quickly. Perhaps even more crucially, geopolitics is not only a dimension of global risk but also a channel of contagion that can transform a sovereign or a liquidity crisis for instance into a worldwide, systemic failure of the international system. Some observers even wonder whether globalization, as a whole, may not come under challenge.\nThe real issue lies in drawing operational implications from geopolitical analysis for businesses and decision-makers. Business executives can become easily obsessed with their inboxes, and be tempted to micromanage, isolate issues and be excessively backward-looking in their analyses as a result. In the Geopolitics, Globalization and Business Strategy Summer School Program, participants will explore how geopolitics can help decision-makers broaden horizons and enrich their strategies by integrating in their thinking global political and macroeconomic issues.\nLEARNING OUTCOMES\nA blended learning experience with pre-recorded sessions, face-to-face sessions, and group work for a comprehensive experience. Upon successful completion of the summer program, participants will be able to:\n- Understand the strategic landscape in which decisions are made;\n- Assess business risks and opportunities entailed by geopolitical dynamics;\n- Monitor changes in the international landscape, including the likelihood of low-probability and high-impact events (black swans);\n- Integrate geopolitical analysis in the firm\u2019s broader international and risk-mitigation strategies;\n- Develop a long-term, consistent strategy and vision, beyond mere day-to-day tactics.\nAssessment\nParticipants will be assessed based on the following:\n- presence and participation\n- group presentations\nParticipants who successfully complete the program will earn 5 ECTS credits. Full attendance is required to obtain the Program Certificate.\nAll students who are seeking credit are encouraged to consult their home academic institution to validate credit transfer."

      "text": "Strategy in an Age of Fragmentation\nAs geopolitics, civil unrest, and technology reshape global strategy, HEC Paris and IRSEM convened a timely dialogue on how firms, states, and civil society must adapt.\n\u00a9 Daniel Brown\nKey Takeaways\n- Strategy is no longer about optimization - it\u2019s about legitimacy. Leaders must balance local coherence with global ambition in an era of diverging political norms.\n- The global economy is shifting from volatility to deep uncertainty. Supply chains, AI governance, and tax policy are now shaped more by politics than efficiency.\n- Fragmentation is not episodic - it\u2019s systemic. From trade regulation to tech standards, today's firms face an unstable patchwork of rules, risks, and responsibilities.\n- AI is not neutral. It has become an essential sovereign infrastructure, embedding national values and regulatory models in its code and deployment.\n- New leadership skills are needed. Strategic coherence beyond business, interdisciplinary fluency, and normative awareness are fast becoming essential C-suite competencies.\nConference Challenges Foundations of Global Business\nOn June 2, 2025, HEC Paris and IRSEM (the French Ministry of Armed Forces\u2019 strategic research institute) co-hosted a groundbreaking conference in central Paris, titled \u201cBusiness Strategy in a Fragmenting World: Firms, States, and Civil Society\u201d. It brought together a remarkable lineup of economists, corporate executives, geopolitical analysts, and policymakers to address a defining challenge of our time: how should global firms operate in a world breaking apart along political, technological, and moral lines?\nThroughout the day, the co-organizers Jeremy Ghez and Olivier Chatain steered conversations toward one unifying question: what frameworks can firms adopt to navigate this fractured world? The HEC Paris professors helped map the contours of a world in which business, governance, and technology are entangled in a crisis of coherence.\nThe day unfolded like a geopolitical drama: supply chains turned strategic; AI debated as a weapon and a public good, corporate legitimacy reframed as a societal compact. Underpinning it all was the quiet realization that globalization\u2019s golden age had ended - not with a bang, but with five panels and a series of increasingly urgent reflections.\nFrom Volatility to Uncertainty: The End of Predictable Strategy\nThe conference began with Eric Mengus, a professor of Economics at HEC Paris, distinguishing volatility - manageable, measurable - from uncertainty, which resists modeling altogether. Fragmentation, he argued, is no longer episodic. It\u2019s systemic. Trade rules shift mid-negotiation. Supply chains adapt not just to market logic but to civic outrage and political embargo. For firms, the new risk isn\u2019t disruption - it\u2019s disorientation.\nThis sentiment found reinforcement in the remarks of Brad Setser, former U.S. Treasury official and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Setser divided his presentation into two parts which, he admitted could appear to contradict each other on the surface. He began by highlighting how resilient the global economy has been, and how difficult it has been to fragment. He insisted that most forecasts made four or eight years ago when Donald Trump was first elected president haven't come true in the economic sphere. And yet, as Setser said in the second part of his talk, the past may not be all that accurate a guide to the future. This is because unlike Trump\u2019s actions in his first term, there is a real possibility that his policies will fragment the Sino-American relationship and the transatlantic relationship. \u201cSo,\u201d Setser concluded, \u201cfragmentation is not a reality, but it is my forecast.\u201d\nAfter his intervention, Setser confided to HEC Paris that he hoped future conferences of this quality would address the sensitive topic of tax avoidance by the world\u2019s richest companies. Business strategy, he noted, has operated too long on the assumption that integration equaled stability. Yet the most durable forms of integration - particularly multinational tax avoidance - have thrived by exploiting policy gaps. \u201cPersistence,\u201d he noted dryly, \u201cis not proof of health.\u201d And he warned that, unless Western economies repair the structural weaknesses in international taxation, they risk sparking a regulatory cold war over corporate legitimacy - with firms caught in the crossfire.\nPower, Sovereignty, and the Strategic Role of Firms\nAfter the academic speakers set the analytical stage, the keynote conversation between Olivier Blum - Chief Executive Officer of Schneider Electric \u2013 and HEC professor Jeremy Ghez offered a powerful insight into the corporate response. Blum spoke not only as a veteran practitioner, but as a realist. In today\u2019s fractured world, he insisted, strategy is no longer about growth or optimization. It\u2019s about legitimacy. That, he insisted, means aligning with local expectations, building trust across diverging systems, and internalizing complexity rather than avoiding it.\nFor multinational firms, especially in regulated sectors, Blum continued, this marks a profound shift. The playbook once built on economies of scale must now make room for divergent legal regimes, civic expectations, and sovereign tech ecosystems. Global strategy has become multi-local.\nIt was a theme echoed later in an AI-focused panel titled \u201cConvergence or Divergence?\u201d featuring Vincent Rapp, Executive Director of Hi! PARIS. Alongside policy experts from RAND Europe, EUISS, and OpenAI, Rapp argued that artificial intelligence isn\u2019t merely a tool. It\u2019s infrastructure - layered, politicized, and increasingly sovereign. Who controls data centers, chip manufacturing, or cloud platforms matters as much as the algorithms themselves.\nEuropean efforts, Rapp noted, have pivoted toward asserting autonomy across this stack - from raw materials to models. But the challenge is steep: dependencies on U.S. cloud providers and lagging scale-up capacities hamper European aspirations. Yet, in Rapp\u2019s view, France has advantages: strong research, relatively clean energy, and growing investment in AI clusters, such as the one anchored by Hi! PARIS, recently awarded \u20ac70 million in public funds for research.\nThe Anatomy of Fragmentation: Five Lenses\nThroughout the day, the five panels dissected the implications of fragmentation from distinct angles. In this way, the panelists moved beyond diagnosis toward redefinition. Rather than present \u201cshopping lists\u201d of challenges, each session traced how fragmentation reconfigures the architecture of decision-making:\n- Geo-economic strategy: the speakers warned that pricing fragmentation into markets isn\u2019t enough; firms must integrate it into risk frameworks. The political economy of supply chains is shifting from efficiency to resilience. This follows the paralysis of the WTO\u2019s dispute settlement system, leading to a significant increase in bilateral trade disputes.\n- Legal and regulatory frameworks: As C\u00e9lia Belin noted, companies operating on both sides of the Atlantic increasingly face binary legal imperatives. As the senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, ECFR, she pointed to the tensions caused by the U.S. contracting codes that frown on DEI vs. French mandates that require it. Conflicts between national laws create impossible compliance binds for firms operating transatlantically, she said.\n- AI and digital infrastructure: Clotilde B\u00f4mont (European Union Institute for Security Studies) provided a sweeping overview of the AI \u201ctech stack,\u201d from critical minerals to semiconductors to data sovereignty. The implication: digital dependencies are now strategic liabilities.\n- Supply chain resilience: What began as a pandemic-driven concern is now permanent strategy. For Susan Helper (Case Western), it is possible to reimagine industrial policy to serve both resilience and social equity. At the same time, the analysis presented by Ludovic Subran (Allianz) underlined that fragmentation is now being priced into markets - but not into corporate risk models. Other panelists noted that the need for redundancy, regionalization, and environmental risk management is no longer optional.\nCorporate governance: Boards and C-suites must rethink what constitutes fiduciary responsibility. It\u2019s no longer just about shareholders - but about navigating normative legitimacy in pluralistic, contested environments. Yet, for Isabelle M\u00e9jean (Sciences Po), tariffs should not be used as catch-all tools since, she noted, civil externalities cannot be solved with a single economic instrument.\u201d\nEach of these themes reinforced the central point: fragmentation is not an external event. It is an operating condition.\nThe Roles of Firms and Civil Society\nAt the intersection of these lenses lies a deeper organizational challenge: how to maintain coherence and purpose within the firm when political and societal demands tug in different directions. This was underlined by Patrice Kefalas, Corporate VP of Innovation and Partnership at Michelin, who noted that \u201calignment\u201d has become one of the hardest currencies of corporate strategy - not just across geographies, but within teams. With stakeholders expecting companies to be geopolitical actors, corporate cohesion is tested like never before.\nThis point resonated with Emlyn Kefengold, head of the Paris bureau at Alderman, who underscored that companies are increasingly looked up to - not just for service delivery or innovation, but as moral compasses and guarantors of legitimacy. \u201cIn a world of institutional mistrust, firms are seen as more competent than governments,\u201d she warned. That reverence, however, is fragile: it comes with the burden of responsibility and a higher cost of failure.\nRonnie Chatterji, Chief Economist at OpenAI and former White House official, brought a constructive perspective. In an era when diplomacy stumbles, he noted, conferences like this one may act as \u201cepistemic bridges\u201d. These knowledge builders could help stave off complete fragmentation by creating shared baselines across sectors. \u201cWe need these spaces of trust,\u201d he said, \u201cif we want AI and deep tech to be governed responsibly.\u201d\nAnd as financial strategist Alexandre Gaillard of Jolt Capital emphasized, the current model of economic fragmentation is inefficient not only for trade, but for innovation. Fragmentation creates duplication, raises costs, and constrains knowledge flows. If left unchecked, it could slow the green transition, dilute global public goods, and exacerbate tensions between major powers.\nFinally, civil society\u2019s agenda is far from neutral. Fabienne Hara of the Paris Peace Forum and Maaike Okano-Heijmans of the Clingendael Institute warned against viewing NGOs and civic actors as mere \u201cbuffers\u201d in geopolitical frictions. Civil society, they argued, is a force in itself - with its own values, its own diplomatic capacity, and its own demands. Its inclusion is not a box-ticking exercise, but a strategic imperative.\nBenjamin Nefussi, from France\u2019s Ministry of the Economy and Finance, echoed this in practical terms: \u201cIndustrial policy is no longer about picking winners. It\u2019s about stress-testing the system.\u201d Civil society, for all its dissonance, may be one of the most effective stress tests firms have.\nThe New Mandate: Strategic Coherence\nBy late afternoon, the room had shifted from diagnosis to reconstruction. If fragmentation is here to stay, what kind of leadership does it demand? Susan Helper, former chief economist at the U.S. Department of Commerce, called for a redefinition of industrial policy - one that balances resilience with social equity. ECFR\u2019s Belin spoke to the contradictions companies face as geopolitical values increasingly shape market access.\nPerhaps the most pressing takeaway came from the conference\u2019s co-organizers, Jeremy Ghez and Olivier Chatain of HEC Paris. Their closing remarks didn\u2019t offer simple prescriptions. Instead, they urged a mindset shift: from managing complexity to owning it. That means equipping future leaders with interdisciplinary fluency, geopolitical intelligence, and the humility to know that neutrality is no longer neutral. These are clear markers for the teaching curricula at business schools like HEC Paris.\nWhat Comes Next?\nThe \u00c9cole Militaire conference felt very much like a prototype of how institutions like HEC Paris and IRSEM can convene actors across sectors to reimagine strategy under stress. In a world where AI models challenge diplomatic norms, supply chains double as national security levers, and corporate behavior is scrutinized for civic coherence, the conference speakers underlined how the firm is no longer a passive actor. It is a geopolitical node.\nThe message was clear: strategy, once about optimization, is now about navigation. And in this age of fragmentation, survival may depend not on predicting the future - but on cultivating the reflexes, partnerships, and values that can hold amid the storm."

An important objective of the Institute was to establish close relationships with policy advisers in government and business to further a two-way flow of ideas and research.\nThe Institute for Policy Analysis was established in 1967 as a research facility to encourage research on economic and social policy issues and to create close relationships with policy advisers in government and business to further a two-way flow of ideas and research.\nRotman Institute for International Business used to host Project LINK and the International Tax Program.\nPolicy and Economic Analysis Program\nThe Policy and Economic Analysis Program (PEAP) is funded by member subscriptions and is designed specifically to communicate the results of policy research to businesses and governments and to provide members direct access to analytical tools \u2013 principally the macroeconometric models \u2013 developed at the IIB. All members receive PEAP's Policy Study and Memo series of electronic publications featuring short-term forecasts and long-term projections for the economies of Canada and Ontario, as well as macro policy oriented commentary and analysis.\nMembership\nMembership in PEAP will be of value especially to corporations, government departments, and trade organizations. Access to PEAP facilitates strategic planning and analyses of alternative macroeconomic policies and external economic environments. National short-term forecasts are released quarterly. Longer-term projections for Canada and Ontario, currently extending over 30 years, are prepared at least twice a year. Policy studies and memos examine ongoing developments in the economy and major evolving policy issues - both with the macro models and using alternative methods of analysis. The longer-term focus of the program, the special coverage of Ontario, and the policy-oriented structure of the models all combine to make PEAP membership an excellent tool for any organization interested in examining a wide range of possible macroeconomic scenarios and in testing the sensitivity of scenarios to alternative policy and external developments.\nPEAP Conferences\nPEAP holds semiannual conferences exclusively for members. The conferences always feature analysis of the current macroeconomic outlook, together with presentations of other work ongoing at PEAP and by colleagues at the Rotman School of Management and the Department of Economics. Recent presentations have included:\n- \"The World Economic Outlook from Project: LINK\" by Peter Pauly, Rotman School of Management.\n- \"The Credit Crunch: What Went Wrong? Why? What Can Be Learned?\" by John Hull, Rotman School of Management.\n- \"Debt, Deficits, Growth and the Euro Crisis\" by Laurence Booth, Rotman School of Management.\n- \"An Introduction to the Economies of the Middle East\" by Walid Hejazi, Rotman School of Management.\n- \"Financing Health Care in Canada\" by Mark Stabile, School of Public Policy and Governance and Rotman School of Management.\n- \"The Impact of Immigration on the Canadian Economy\" by Peter Dungan, Rotman School of Management.\nContact\nPeter Dungan, Professor\nPeter Dungan is an Associate Professor Emeritus of Economic Analysis and Policy, with cross-appointments at the Department of Economics and the School of Public Policy and Governance. He is also the Director of Rotman\u2019s Policy and Economic Analysis Program. His research concentration is on computer simulation models of the Canadian and Ontario economies. He also forms the backbone of an ongoing program developing both short-term and long-term economic forecasts for Canada and Ontario.\n416 978 4182 PDdungan@rotman.utoronto.ca\nSteve Murphy, Research Associate\n416 978 6652 Murphy@chass.utoronto.ca\nFresh insights\nResearch\nDive deeply into fascinating new thinking and research on issues that are top of mind to global leaders. In this section you will get a sense of the wide range of research underway.\nBy Walid Hejazi, Jianmin Tang and Weimin Wang\nThis research shows that firms in a productivity range below the required ex-ante threshold productivity level can successfully venture abroad when learning allows these firms to rise above that threshold productivity level, ex-post. The hypotheses developed are tested using panel data on firms operating in Canada over the period 2000 to 2014. These firm-level data include measures of productivity, firm size, R&D intensity, and when firms undertake outward FDI. The authors demonstrate that firms which venture abroad while in the threshold productivity range and also have sufficiently high levels of absorptive capacity, proxied by R&D intensity, are able to learn from their foreign experience, and hence increase their productivity levels, ex-post.\nBy Professors Walid Hejazi and Dan Trefler\nThis research shows FDI barriers are not only costly to Canadian consumers, but resulting inefficiencies have a \u2018\u2018magnified effect\u2019\u2019 on the overall economy in terms of lagging productivity, fewer jobs and lower earnings. As the second most restrictive G7 country in FDI legislation, there restrictions cost the economy 137,400 jobs or 9.6 billion in lost earnings, distortions that are greater than the amount of excess profits gained by the incumbents. Losses loom larger than gains in some sectors. The research also highlights the merits of FDI to local economies and the importance of ensuring that basic business services sectors (key \u2018upstream\u2019 sectors air transportation, banking, and telecom) are operating as efficiently as possible\nDownload Research Digest \u00bb OP - ED (Globe and Mail)\nBy Professor Robert Staiger\nAuthor Robert Staiger develops the first theoretical framework to study the economics of trade agreements when countries carry out digital transactions. The paper proposes that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) provide the tools to regulate trade in digital goods and services, and it shows how this regulation should happen.\nBy Professors Bernardo Blum, Sebastian Claro, Kunal Dasgupta, and Ignatius Horstmann\nGlobal income inequality among OECD countries is the highest it has been for the past half century. Per-shipment costs \u2014 which affect the size and frequency with which exporters ship goods \u2014 vary widely between countries and are, indeed, correlated with economic output. Authors Bernardo Blum, Sebastian Claro, Kunal Dasgupta, and Ignatius Horstmann say that variation in per-shipment costs can explain nearly 40 percent of the income differences between countries. A country at the ninetieth percentile of per shipment costs has almost three times higher costs than at tenth percentile. Equalizing the per shipment cost across all countries at the level currently in the United States would have a significant impact on reducing income inequality across countries by 27 percent.\nDownload Research Digest \u00bb | Download full paper \u00bb | American Economic Association Chart of the Week \u00bb\nThe major issues of this report are:\n\u2022 Responding to challenges stemming from recent bilateral political and legal tensions: December 1, 2018, to March 1, 2019\n\u2022 Barriers to doing business in China and Canada\n\u2022 Leveraging Brand Canada and trends in profitability\n\u2022 Addressing intellectual property rights\n\u2022 Looking to the future\nDownload the report \u00bb | Canada China Business Council Business Impact Survey 2018-2019\nThe survey reveals that three main factors affected Canada-China business in 2019: Canada-China relations, the US-China trade war, and economic developments in China, with COVID-19 becoming a significant impediment to business in early 2020.\nCanada China Business Council Business Impact Survey 2019-2020\nMeet the team\nConnect\nFor general inquiries please contact us at:\nInstitute for International Business\nRotman School of Management\n105 St. George Street\nToronto, Canada M5S 3E6"
