Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements made in this report regarding the merger, including the benefits of the merger, revenue opportunities, anticipated future financial and operating performance, and results, including estimates for growth. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, they are based only on management\u2019s current beliefs, expectations, and assumptions.
