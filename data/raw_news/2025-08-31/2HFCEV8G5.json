  "content": "Do Suction Cups Really Work On Car Dents? Here's What You Should Know\n\nWhen it comes to the best DIY methods for removing dents from your car, suction cup dent pullers are some of the easiest methods to try on your own. Using these to repair dents is cheap, easy, and should not take a long time, but do suction cups work well on car dents? Sometimes using cup pullers can give great results, but in other cases, the results can be a bit mixed. The effectiveness of suction cup dent pullers depends on the size, the depth, the material, and the location of the dent. It also depends on whether the surface is smooth or creased. Furthermore, the cup needs enough surface to stick to in order to have a chance of succeeding. Either way, knowing the limitations of using suction cups to repair car dents might just save you the frustration and guide you toward the right repair approach for your car. Here is everything you need to know about suction cup dent repair, and whether you should try it yourself.\n\nTo maximize the effect of using suction cups to fix car dents, it's best to first clean the surface on which the suction cup ought to be mounted. With the surface fully dried, be sure to press firmly with the suction cup so it sticks to the dent. Some cups require you to pump the suction to achieve the necessary vacuum, while others only require a firm push. It's also a good idea to have at least the essential home tool kit products, which will help you avoid getting stuck mid-repair. If you work with a smaller dent, place the suction cup directly in the middle of the dent, while larger dents will require you to work from one side to the other. While pulling, make sure to pull through the middle of the cup, as pulling to or from one side is more likely to remove it. Moreover, use a heat gun or warm water to heat the area up to make the plastic or metal more pliable and easier to work with. If there are any high spots on the dent, use a rubber hammer to gently tap them back into place. Lastly, a special note for plastic bumpers and surfaces is to warm the backside if accessible, or to push it from the back while gently pulling with the cup.\n\nLimitations of using the suction cups method Using suction cups can at least partially remove both small and large dents, but the results of suction methods may vary. They are not a real substitute for professional repairs because they cannot completely fix the dent: Depending on the severity of the impact, suction cups tend to leave uneven surfaces even after successfully pulling it off. Suction cup pullers can also cause the car's paint to chip away if not properly attached, or due to glue. Since these are DIY repairs, they might not be able to restore the vehicle to its original condition. In the end, that's not going to help your car's resale value. Even though a professional repair costs more money, it solves the problem entirely, and thus helps the car's resale value. In reality, using suction cups to fix car dents can often take ages, and there are no guarantees that all that time will actually amount to a fixed car. Fully repairing dents on a car is not an easy process. It takes precision, time, and experience from a professional to be able to fully remove a dent, and such services aren't easy or cheap.",

      "text": "6 Essential Items You Need In Your Home Tool Kit\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nWhether you own a home or rent one, you need a set of tools for decorating and maintaining it. Sure, you can always hire a handyman or specialist for these repairs, but you're still going to want these tools for basic tasks and emergencies. However, with the vast available options out on the market, building out your basic home tool kit could get a bit daunting.\nSo, to help get you started, we're listing out the basic equipment you may need in your home. After you've chosen a toolbox from one of the major brands to keep your tools safe, this list will help you pick out the tools you'll want to put in it. You'll find all these tools useful for just about anything \u2014 from opening boxes, fixing basic repairs, and crafting things. They might even help you find a new hobby in woodworking.\nWe picked out these tools based on the recommendations of DIY communities and several homeowners. Many state that they used these tools for basic repairs and home upgrades, like installing cheap tech items that made their home smart. We'll add more details of our methodology which can be found at the end of this article.\nA tape measure is essential for planning\nA tape measure is useful for measuring material you're about to cut, whether you're building something from scratch or simply need to cut an item. If you're buying furniture for your home, the tool is useful to measure the space where you'll put it first. That way, you can ensure that the stuff you're getting will fit in the allotted space. Also, don't forget to measure the doors and hallways the furniture will need to pass through.\nMeasuring tapes are also essential for installing hooks on your walls, so you can get your paintings and photographs at exactly the right height. More than that, they are not just simple measuring tools. Furthermore, tape measures have other functions to help you out, like having a slot on the hook to grab onto nails or screws. These hooks are also loosely attached to the tape measure so that it can adjust its length whether you're measuring the inside or outside of a space, ensuring that you get an accurate measurement no matter what.\nThere are a couple of tips when using a measuring tape that many people follow. First, the adage \"measure twice, cut once\" is often heard in carpentry and woodworking, but it also applies to just about anything worth measuring. It's best to be sure of your measurement before any permanent cutting. Additionally, it's advised to always use the same measuring tape throughout a project. Inches don't change but the metal piece of one measuring tape may be slightly off compared to another.\nCheap box cutters will help you open your packages\nYou may have a knife or two in your kitchen for cutting up food items, but you should not use them for other purposes to ensure they stay sanitary. Aside from that, you wouldn't want to dull these knives quickly, especially if you purchased an expensive knife set. So, for other uses, you ought to have a box cutter or multi-functional utility knife. While the latter is far more durable, if you only need something to occasionally use for cutting and you don't want to spend too much money, a box cutter should suffice.\nBox cutters are useful for opening packages and cutting ropes, which is great if you're used to receiving boxes from Amazon and other online marketplaces. Aside from that, if you pair it with a ruler or straight edge, you could use the box cutter to cut a straight line \u2014 this is a useful trick if you have trouble cutting a straight line with scissors.\nAnother advantage that most box cutters have is that they're easy to replace once the tip of the blade dulls. If you look at the blade, you'd often see some scoring on it. When the tip doesn't cut well anymore, you just need to break it off along the scoring, and you should have a sharp tip again. Once you've broken off most of the blade, refills tend to be fairly cheap, allowing you to extend the life of the cutting tool.\nA screwdriver set will always come in handy\nAlmost everything around the house is held together by screws \u2014 whether it's your air fryer, your laptop, or your door, among many other household items. That's why a screwdriver set is essential to have in your home. You should also get a complete set, especially as screws come in different sizes. If your screwdriver is too large, it won't fit into the head of a screw, and if it's too small, you might end up stripping it, making it difficult to remove with a bare screwdriver. Though, there are some easy tricks to remove a stripped screw if need be.\nThe two most common types of screwdrivers are the flathead and Phillips screwdrivers. However, if you want to be overprepared, a complete set like the DeWalt 71-Piece Screwdriver Bit Set comes with other bits like hex and Torx, allowing you to work with screws that have exotic heads.\nSome sets even offer nut bits, allowing you to ditch wrenches. But if you're doing that, ensure that you're getting a screwdriver where you can bend the handle by 90 degrees. That way you will have some form of leverage, especially if you're removing a nut that's quite stuck on the threads of the screw.\nYou need one good hammer for building anything\nOf course, we cannot forget about the lowly hammer as a basic home tool. Even if you don't see yourself building furniture or working with wood, a hammer is important for driving nails and other components where they need to be. For example, door hinge pins could sometimes shimmy out of position. It's nearly impossible to put them back using sheer hand strength, but a hammer can help force it back down into position.\nWe also recommend a claw hammer over other types of hammers, like a mallet or ball-peen hammer. This is because you can use the claw hammer to pull out nails \u2014 an important ability if you have wooden floors or walls. If a nail is sticking out and bent out of place, you could just use the claw to pull it out and replace it with a new one.\nSince hammers are pretty basic tools, you can easily find one at your nearest hardware store. However, if you want one that will last you a lifetime, you can check out the recommended hammer in our list of must-have Lowe's tools to complete your tool kit.\nPliers are great for working with wires and cables\nOur world runs on electricity and electricity runs through wires, so it's good to have a tool that will help you fix them. This is where pliers come in \u2014 they're especially useful for pulling, straightening, and bending cables. There are many different types of pliers, but a good starting point are either long-nose or needle-nose pliers.\nThese pliers have a tapered end, making it easier to grab items in tight places. Furthermore, some of these pliers also have wire cutters built near the pivot point, making them perfect for working with your home's wiring. We also recommend getting pliers with nice, thick insulation. That way, you have less hand fatigue as you don't feel the hard metallic handles. Aside from that, thick rubber handles offer protection against potential electrocution.\nOf course, if you don't know what you're doing, you should always consult a licensed professional, especially when it comes to electricity. But if it's just a basic repair like fixing a loose cable and you know how to switch off the main power, then pliers are an essential part of your toolbox.\nA cordless drill will save you a lot of time\nMany people use hooks to hang decorations and other items on. This might not be too much of an issue if you only plan to hang light things that can be handled by a stick-on hook. But if you want to put heavier things on your walls, like a coat hook or a pull-up exercise bar, you definitely need to drill a hole to ensure that they're secured to your walls. This is where the cordless drill comes in. When you pair this tool with a drill bit set, you can drive screws and hooks where you need them and start securely hanging or installing things in your home.\nYou could use a screwdriver if you wanted to save money, but you also may want to consider your time. If you hand screw one screw that isn't pre-drilled, it may take about two to five minutes, depending on how hard the material is. If you need to install ten screws, that's equivalent to about 20 to 50 minutes \u2014 quite a long time just for assembling one thing. Aside from that, experts recommend pre-drilling your screw holes, which will prevent splintering your wood and avoid misalignments. You could then use the cordless drill to drive the screw in as little as five seconds or less.\nHowever, using a drill can be dangerous if you're unsure how to properly use the tool. There are many mistakes that people make when using a drill around the house, so it's best to ensure you are comfortable with your tool before putting holes in walls and assembling furniture.\nWhy we consider these items basic equipment for your toolbox\nWe've based our selection on the feedback of experts and the experience of our own team. We also checked several popular and resourceful discussion boards, such as Reddit, and found that these are tools people often buy based on their needs and recommendations. Eventually, as you get more into DIY or develop your own hobbies, you'll want more specialized tools. But if you're just starting out or want to ensure you have the proper tools for typical home tool kit necessities, these should be more than enough to get you started. However, there are a plethora of budget-friendly tools for everyday tasks that will appeal to any homeowner."

      "text": "The Best DIY Methods For Removing Dents From Your Car\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nIf you are a vehicle owner, chances are you might wind up getting an accidental dent or ding that you may have to cough up extra money to fix. Depending on the severity, you can spend an arm and a leg and take it to a professional body shop \u2014 or you can go ham and fix it by yourself (yes, it's totally possible). Believe it or not, there are many tried and tested, professionally-approved DIY methods that anyone can do to fix dents and dings in their car. It involves using simple tools that you find around the house and cost you little to no money (via Carvana). And, you don't have to be a car expert, either, for any of them to be successful.\nThese tips can help to restore your car back to its pristine state, so you don't have to stress or break the bank in the process.\nHeat is key\nRemoving a dent in your car is sometimes as simple as pouring hot water on it. You may need to see it to believe it, but this is a proven method by car experts and people who've banged up their cars alike. Don't expect this to work if you smashed your car, but for minor dents due to parking mishaps, hail, and even accidental grocery cart collisions (more common than you may think), this method might save you a boatload of money.\nThere are two ways to go about doing this. You can either use a combination of hot water and a plunger, or your bare hands. If you are using a plunger, first fill a container with boiling hot water and pour it over the affected area. Then, take a wet plunger (it's important for it to be wet, so it can stick to the surface) and hover it directly on top of the dent. The plunger is a powerful suction tool, and you should be able to get the dent to pop out by pushing hard and pulling it. If you do it correctly, the dent should straighten out in a matter of minutes (via Solid Smack).\nIf you don't have a plunger available, your hands work equally as well. It may take a tad bit longer for it to work, though. Again, pour a container of hot water over the dent. Afterward, place your hands behind the car's metal wall, and push until you hear the dent pop out.\nA blast of hot and cold\nOne of the most popular hacks on the internet to remove car dents is to use a hair dryer plus compressed air. However, it's been proven that this DIY tip is a dud, and will not work for most car dents. A more effective tip you can use is to ditch the hair dryer and get a heat gun that you can buy in any home improvement store. This tool blasts heat up to temperatures of 1,200 degrees Fahrenheit and is more likely to smooth over the damage.\nAll you have to do is heat up the dent, as well as the area a few inches outside of the dent to make it pliable. After about three to five minutes, spray the heated area with a round of compressed air. You'll see a layer of ice form over the dent, and when it starts to melt, the dent should pop out (via Car Capsule).\nUse an all-in-one set\nMany car owners swear by dent removal kits for the times when they want to avoid sending your car to the body shop. No car repair experience is necessary to use them, and only demand your patience and some of your time in order to see results(via Family Handyman). These kits work well on small and medium-sized dings and can save a lot of money and energy in the long run. And, the best part is that you'll still be able to drive your car around while you fix it.\nThey are inexpensive too. Most of these kits cost between $50 to $100 (via Amazon) and unless the dents in your vehicle are the size of craters or your vehicle is completely wrecked, they should do the trick.\nThese dent removal kits include tools that can remove blemishes efficiently such as a suction cup, glue gun, dent lifter, hammer, shovel, rod, and more."

      "text": "What To Do If You Car Ends Up With Chipped Paint\nWe may receive a commission on purchases made from links.\nHave you ever taken a moment to really look at your car and were horrified to find paint chips you've never seen before? You're not alone. Unfortunately, paint chips can happen to even the most careful car owners, and they can be due to honest mistakes, natural wear and tear, or even things that are beyond your control.\nCars experience chipped paint for a variety of reasons, such as the weather, minor accidents, the environment, harsh chemical materials, and even vandalism. Aside from being an eyesore, paint chips on your car can expose its metal to corrosion and lead to more serious issues like rust. So, if you find that your car paint is chipped, the first thing that you need to do is assess the overall damage to the vehicle.\nTo properly assess the chipped paint, gently clean the area first using soap, water, and a microfiber cloth. By removing the potential dirt or debris, you can also prepare your car for possible repair. While you're at it, make sure to avoid typical car cleaning mistakes to not add more damage to your vehicle, like washing under the hot sun or using the wrong kind of chemicals.\nHow to assess chipped car paint\nIn some cases, people can mistake scratches or scuffs for chipped paint. While scuffs are marks from another object or vehicle, scratches are when the car's coating has actual damage. However, a key difference between car scratches and paint chipping is that some scratches can be repaired with just buffing and a clear coat. On the other hand, paint chipping will always require some sort of repainting.\nStormwise shares that paint chips are often classified in three ways: small (smaller than a dime), medium (up to the size of a quarter), and large (larger than a quarter). Aside from this, it also shares that things like spreading, flaking, or rusting should also be taken into consideration during the damage assessment.\nIf you're not sure about the extent of the paint chip damage, a professional auto mechanic will also be able to tell you if it is only superficial or more serious. If you're not willing to pay them for the repair itself, you can also just consult for the correct color and ask for tips on how to avoid paint bubbling or dripping. If the chip is small enough, you're short on cash, or you just want to learn a new skill, you can definitely try to repair it at home. To do that, here are some things you should purchase ahead of time.\nBuying your repair materials\nBefore you get started, you need to find the right paint color for the job. To find the right color, you can check the Safety Compliance Certification or door jamb label on the inside door of your vehicle (if your vehicle was built after 1983) or share your Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) with an attendant at your local car store. That being said, if you did modifications to your car, like changing the paint, you might need to approach the auto shop that did it for the color details.\nNext, decide whether to get a touch-up paint pen, spray, or liquid tub. For smaller paint chips, the touch-up pen should be more than enough and can easily be stored in your car for emergencies. However, you'll need to get a spray or gallon for more serious and larger chips. For example, the Dupli-Color Perfect Match Premium Automotive Paint is available on Amazon in 206 colors and patterns with a rating of 4.2 over 34,000 reviews. Alternatively, some services like Automotive Touchup also let you order touch-up paint, which includes the base coat and clear coat, online.\nWhile you're at it, you can also purchase an automotive primer, such as the Rust-Oleum 260510 Automotive 2-in-1 Filler & Sandable Primer ($7.88), which has 4.6 stars over 5000 reviews on Amazon. Some primers have additional benefits, like rust prevention as well. Similar to touch-up paint, you can find automotive primers in most auto shops or even retailers like Walmart.\nSteps to repair car paint chips\nOnce the damaged area is clean and you've chosen the right paint chip repair kit for your needs, the next thing you should do is remove any rust. To do this, dab a Q-Tip with WD-40, swab it against the rusted area, and repeat the process until the Q-Tip returns clean. If you find that the rust is deep enough to damage your car's body, you may want to consider getting a professional opinion before proceeding because it may require some additional sanding.\nAfter all the rust is gone, the next step is to apply automotive primer using the applicator brush that came with it. During this process, wait for the primer to dry completely before attempting anything else. Next, apply the touch-up paint in the form of a pen, spray, or brush.\nTo avoid unwanted bubbling or streaking, let the paint settle properly before adding another layer. To match the new paint with the rest of your vehicle, you may also have to polish and buff the rest of the car using a power buffer.\nOnce you're happy with the appearance, allow the paint to dry completely before checking if it will need another coat. Lastly, to add a new layer of protection from the elements, you can use wax, an essential car cleaning tool you probably have in your garage.\nKeeping your car looking brand new\nWhen it comes to repairing your car in any way, it's always best to also understand the limits of your skills. Should you realize that the damage is beyond your capacity to fix, hiring a professional to do the job can save you time, effort, and money in the long run.\nSometimes, you might not even notice when paint chips occur right away because they may have happened in a spot you don't normally notice. Knowing this, it's important to bring your car to its regular scheduled maintenance. Aside from paint chips, regular maintenance checks can help sound the alarm for symptoms of other potential problems in your car, like uneven tire wear.\nIn general, it's also best to avoid common mistakes car owners make that can ruin their vehicle's paint, like drying it too hard, putting objects on top of it, covering it with a car cover, and even just leaning on it unnecessarily. In doing so, you can keep your car's paint nicer for longer and maintain your vehicle's resale value in the process."
