      "feedback": "Overall, the draft does well in sketching a three-regime framework and plausible catalysts, but to reach world-class quality you should: (i) make the causal chain explicit and testable—map policy shocks (tariff truce), inflation pass-through, capex/margins, and asset prices into a single coherent transmission to equities, credit spreads, and FX, anchored in first principles; (ii) reformulate into exactly four one-sentence lines (2 Up, 2 Down) with strictly defined time windows, each line tying a single driver to a concrete observable trigger (e.g., 90-day tariff extension expiry, Nvidia licensing mechanics including a 15% revenue share, export-control tightening on rare earths/chips, Xi–Trump high-level talks, CPI/Fed guidance, AUKUS capacity signals) and a clear invalidation condition; (iii) anchor every numeric claim to the best-supported facts and assign explicit, sourced probability ranges rather than ad hoc percentages, e.g., Up 0–4 weeks conditioned on CPI path (NOTMRPS8C) and Nvidia/licensing signals; Up 8–24 weeks anchored to the AI-productivity uplift scale from Norges Bank discourse (AMHSWFZZI); Down 0–3 weeks and Down 4–8 weeks tied to tangible tightening signals (e.g., export controls, rare-earth constraints) with explicit thresholds; (iv) ensure all assertions cite IDs only from the provided sources and avoid mixing figures from disparate contexts without explicit reconciliation; (v) prune extraneous sources and keep the four lines tightly aligned to the regime IDs (OATKNJQ0E, NOTMRPS8C, AMHSWFZZI, 40M82JY72, P3SY5CIWY, A8QHO9CST, MHTXPY45K, ZCBJZ55IT, WACQ58GJF, V7GV8YBQU, RHXDOHQQX, X955JYCLU, VJH1YPVX5, D5X8K1DDU, 9ER6IEHVO); (vi) enforce the horizon/style constraint by keeping language crisp, forward-looking, and devoid of filler, and (vii) offer a ready-to-dublish rewritten four-line draft upon request.",
