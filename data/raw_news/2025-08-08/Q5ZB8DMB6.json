  "content": "Three separate federal courts ruled against the pharmaceutical industry this week, with some cases having previously been dismissed.\n\nA federal judge dismissed the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s lawsuit challenging Medicare negotiations a year ago, and this ruling was upheld Wednesday by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe suit was dismissed on the basis that some of the plaintiffs \u2014 the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce, the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, and the Michigan Chamber of Commerce \u2014 lacked standing to sue.\n\nWhile the appeals court clarified that local and state organizations can sue over federal laws that impact them, it still found that the case was improperly filed. The court agreed that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce had standing to sue, but it would need to file a new lawsuit in a separate venue.\n\nOn Thursday, Medicare negotiation lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the program were both ruled against.\n\nPhRMA, another trade group, saw its lawsuit dismissed by a Texas federal judge who found that the organization had failed to demonstrate irreparable harm or constitutional violations stemming from Medicare negotiations.\n\nIn Connecticut, the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a decision from last year against the pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim. Three of the company\u2019s products have been selected for Medicare negotiation.\n\nAs has been the case in other rulings, such as the one in Texas, the court relied on the fact that participation in Medicare is entirely voluntary, meaning companies are not being deprived of certain rights because of the negotiation program.\n\nWhen reached for comment by The Hill, PhRMA spokesperson Sarah Ryan said, \u201cWe disagree with the district court\u2019s legal assessment. We continue to believe the IRA\u2019s price-setting provisions are unconstitutional.\u201d\n\nWith compounding losses in appellate courts, the pharmaceutical industry may be gearing up to take Medicare negotiations before the Supreme Court.",
