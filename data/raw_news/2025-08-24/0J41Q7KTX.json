  "title": "Warning Signs Abound In Trade Data As Fed Hints At Lowering Interest Rates",
  "description": "In just three months, tariffs as a percentage of imports quadrupled, topping 10% for the first time in two decades, according to U.S. data, and probably decades longer.",
  "content": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell signaled Friday that the first rate cut of 2025 could come next month, squeezed as the Fed is by a weakening job market and rising inflation tied to President Trump\u2019s trade war with the world.\n\nI will leave the job market to others. In the merchandise trade data, I see warning signs that might give a generally cautious Fed chairman and other voting members of the Federal Reserve pause.\n\nIn just three months, tariffs as a percentage of total imports quadrupled, topping 10% for the first time in two decades, according to available government data I analyzed, and certainly decades longer.\n\nSince tariffs rates have been largely stable for decades, after decades of gradual decline, that rate of increase \u2013 the quadrupling \u2013 is almost certainly unprecedented since the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act so often cited as a contributing factor to the Great Depression.\n\nIn the same three months \u2013 April, May and June \u2013 the percentage of total imports that entered the United States tariff free dropped below 65% for only the first and second times in just under 20 years, 234 months.\n\nU.S. trade with the world fell for the third consecutive month in June, which is the latest Census Bureau data.\n\nThe Fed will make its September decision without data reflecting the impact of tariffs on most of the world\u2019s leading trade partners. The tariff rate on the three largest U.S. importers, Mexico, Canada and China, respectively, are still not resolved. The broad outline of a deal announced with the European Union occurred in late July. Trump has announced tariffs on a wide range of import categories as well that will not be reflected in the data, including semiconductors and pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe U.S. trade deficit was a record $692.15 billion through June, a jump of 27.88% when compared to the first six months of last year. While that might not be of paramount concern to the Federal Reserve, and certainly not most economists, Trump might react aggressively in the coming weeks, given that his effort to greatly reduce the trade deficit has actually backfired.\n\nAnother troubling number is that the value of U.S. exports earlier this year dipped below 37% of total trade. While that percentage is now slightly above 37%, it was and still is particularly bad news for U.S. exports and their producers and manufacturers. The last time a year ended below 37% was 2006. While a statistical cousin to the trade deficit, it is actually more telling.\n\nThere are also a couple of wild cards in play, the first of which will almost certainly play into the Fed\u2019s calculations and the second which might even though it shouldn\u2019t.\n\nFirst, Trump has relied on the International Economic Powers Act for a great deal of his trade war, declaring the U.S. trade deficit a national emergency. In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled the tariffs were illegal. While that case is on appeal, those tariffs remain in effect. The case will almost certainly make its way to the Supreme Court. How long can the issue remain unresolved?\n\nWhich leads to the second wild card. The midterm Congressional elections will determine whether Trump continues with a majority in the House of Representatives. Worrisome inflation tied to tariffs that were the doing of the Republican president, should it materialize, would certainly make holding the slender majority more difficult.\n\nCome September, the Federal Reserve will once again decide whether to lower interest rates. It\u2019s safe to assume the Fed will have a great deal of data on the job market and inflation, particularly on the impact of tariffs, however incomplete.",

      "text": "After a blistering first quarter fueled by a pre-tariff rush, U.S. trade with the world fell for the third consecutive month, according to U.S. Census Bureau data released Tuesday.\nTotal U.S. trade was $445.40 billion in June, down 3.08% from May. In May, trade had fallen for the second month in a row, albeit a scant 1.11%. In April, U.S. trade with the world had taken a real tumble, down 12.91% from March.\nMarch was the tail-end of a blistering first quarter as importers rushed to get their goods into the United States ahead of tariffs on the world that Trump said would go into effect on April 2. Since then, the president has paused, increased and decreased those tariffs a number of times, the most recent deadline having been Aug. 1.\nTrade goes up and down on a monthly basis, but the last time U.S. trade fell three or more consecutive months was the four months from November 2023 through February of 2024.\nOn a monthly basis, the following countries saw their trade fall at least $1 billion from the previous month:\n- Ireland, down $6.95 billion. Ireland, a hub for U.S. pharmaceutical imports, saw its trade decline 46.34% from May to $8.05 billion. That\u2019s less than one-fourth of the March total, which was $32.13 billion and the lowest monthly total since February of 2024.\n- Switzerland, down $2.68 billion. Switzerland, a hub for U.S. gold trade, particularly on the import side, saw its trade decline 24.70% in June from May, from $10.86 billion to $8.18 billion. For the months of January, February and March, Swiss trade with the United States was more than triple the total for June. U.S. trade with Switzerland is, however, up 30.56% from the previous June. I wrote about U.S. trade with Switzerland one day ago.\n- Mexico, down $1.54 billion. The nation\u2019s top trade partner, Mexico saw its trade decline only 2.07% from May, below the 3.08% U.S. average with the world. The $72.98 billion total for June is the fourth highest monthly total in the last two years.\n- Germany, down $1.36 billion. Germany\u2019s trade with the United States fell from $19.77 billion to $18.41 billion in June, a decline of 6.89%. Its U.S. trade, however, has been remarkably consistent compared to U.S. trade with other countries and given the volatile trade environment President Trump has created with the European Union. Excluding the $23.78 billion total in March, it has ranged from a low of $18.33 billion to a high of $20.86 billion over the last 24 months.\n- France, down $1.35 billion. France is one of the four countries with a double-digit decline in June as well as a drop in excess of $1 billion from the previous month, Switzerland, Ireland and Hong Kong being the other three. France\u2019s trade with the United States fell 13.45%, from $10.03 billion to $8.68 billion.\n- Hong Kong, down $1.28 billion. Hong Kong\u2019s 32.85% one-month decrease from May is second only to Ireland\u2019s 46.34% decline. Hong Kong trade fell from $3.71 billion in May to $2.49 billion in June. Its U.S. trade is down 14.40% from the previous June and 22.05% from June of 2023. Among the trade partners in this group, those are the steepest declines for those time periods. (The Census Bureau reports data for Hong Kong separate from China data as it does with Macau though both are controlled by China.)\n- The Netherlands, down $1.21 billion. Unlike the other countries on this list and despite seeing its trade decline more than $1 billion, the $11.09 billion total is the fourth-highest total over the last two years, with March, May and April of this year the top three. It is also one of two \u201ccountries\u201d on this list, the other being Hong Kong, with which the United States regularly runs a surplus.\nDespite trade falling in June for the third consecutive month, U.S. trade with the world year-to-date is up 9.59% to $2.71 trillion.\nMexico remains the top-ranked trade partner YTD though Canada ranked first for the month of June.\nJFK International Airport remains the nation\u2019s top-ranked port, followed by Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport and Port Laredo. But Port Laredo, the nation\u2019s top port last year, ranked first for the month of June.\nAmong U.S. exports, civilian aircraft and parts remains top-ranked followed by three energy exports, oil, refined petroleum products and natural gas, including LNG.\nAmong U.S. imports, computers and computer hardware is the leading import, fueled by the needs of the explosive artificial intelligence industry and its need for computing power.\nAt the national level, U.S. exports increased 4.59% to $1.01 trillion, the first time exports have topped $1 trillion halfway through the year. U.S. imports have increased at almost three times that pace, up 12.82% to $1.70 trillion.\nThe U.S. deficit increased to $682.35 billion, an increase of 27.76% from the same six months of 2024.\nTotal trade, total exports, total imports and the U.S. deficit are all running at record paces through the first half of the year.\nThe percentage of U.S. trade that was an export \u2013 a relatively stable statistic, stood at 37% through June, down from 39% the last two years.\nThe data shows a tale of two halves: a frenzied first quarter followed by a three-month slowdown. The question now is whether this recent decline is a temporary blip or the first sign that the president\u2019s trade policies are beginning to cool the U.S. trade and, perhaps, the economy."

      "text": "Yes, U.S. trade is running at a record pace this year. Yes, that includes record exports. Yes, that includes record imports. Soon enough, we will see how much of that was stockpiling ahead of threatened tariffs from President Trump, in the 47th term of a U.S. president.\nBut there\u2019s one number going in the wrong direction, and I am not talking about the trade deficit. That, too, is of course at a record pace as well through April, according to the latest U.S. Census Bureau data I analyzed.\nThe number I watch, and watch closely despite its seemingly slight movements, is the ratio between exports and imports. That number stood at 36.75% through April.\nThe last time the United States finished a year below that was the four years from 2003 through 2006.\nNot before, to my knowledge, and not since.\nWhat\u2019s different now is that, generally speaking across the last three decades, the ratio of exports has either grown or remained steady, as the chart at the top of this post shows. Not now.\nHold on, this one might seem a little wonky but the only real concept at play here is this: The ratio of exports to imports is every bit if not more important than the difference between the two.\nLet\u2019s start with what\u2019s so special about those four years? That was right after China entered the World Trade Organization and unleashed its manufacturing might on the United States and the world.\nChina is, of course, at the center of Trump\u2019s tariff war with the world, announced April 2, quickly paused, and scheduled to resume in early July.\nBut almost every year after that four-year trough, as the Chinese appetite for U.S. exports increased, that percentage moved toward the historical norm of 39.95%.\nThat might not sound like a big difference 36.75% and 39.95% \u2013 but when U.S. annual trade is $5.33 trillion, as it was in 2024, a 1% move is equal to $53.3 billion. A move of 3.2 percentage points \u2013 in other words, to the average over the last three decades \u2013 is equal to $170.56 billion.\nI can\u2019t imagine there\u2019s an exporter in this country who wouldn\u2019t want at least a little of that action.\nWhat happened in the decade after that four-year trough? U.S. exports to China from 2006 to 2016 were larger than to any other country in the world, except Mexico, which was benefitting from the North America Free Trade Agreement.\nWhile not growing as much, exports to China were growing faster than those to Mexico. That\u2019s because China was starting from a smaller base. U.S. exports to China increased 83.67% compared to 69.39% for Mexico \u2013 even with the more difficult logistics involved.\nThe growth in exports \u2013 imports from China were also rising rapidly, as was the U.S. deficit with China \u2013 showed up in the U.S. percentage of trade with China that was an export. It increased from a rather paltry 15.72% in 2006 to a slightly less paltry 20.01% in 2016.\nWhile the increasing trade deficit (exports minus imports) represents the strength of American buying power, the percentage of total trade that is an export (exports divided by total trade) represents billions in additional U.S. exports of soybeans, aircraft, medical devices and more.\nSince 2016, that export ratio has continued to climb.\nIn the nine full years since, it has topped 20% seven times, falling below for only the first two years of Trump\u2019s first term. Thus far in 2025, the percentage is 23.81%.\nThat\u2019s still well below the average with the world, of course, at just under 40%. And there\u2019s no disputing that the high tariffs that Trump put on U.S. imports from China in his first term, tariffs generally left in place by former President Joe Biden, have had an impact on the trade relationship.\nI have written about how the U.S. deficit with China, five times greater than any other deficit with the world when Trump entered office the first time, is now only 50% greater than that of Mexico. And yet, the U.S. deficit continues to climb, topping $1 trillion six of the last eight years.\nI have written that China\u2019s percentage of U.S. trade dipped to its lowest level in more than two decades. And yet, U.S. trade continues to climb, as other trade partners, Vietnam among them, have continued to grow rapidly.\nI have written that China has slipped to rank third among U.S. trade partners, after ranking first, that it also fell behind Mexico as an importer into the United States. Trade with Mexico has been robust \u2013 and the U.S. deficit with Mexico has swollen as China\u2019s has retracted.\nI have written that most symbolic of Chinese imports, the cell phone, and its related parts, dipped to their lowest level in two decades. And cell phone imports have remained robust but shifted to India and Vietnam.\nI have written about what the Trump administration deemed the \u201cDirty 15,\u201d those countries with which the United States has its largest trade deficits. Most are both our largest export markets and our allies.\nFor decades, the United States government, albeit begrudgingly, seemed to believe that a focus on U.S. exports would eventually be better than a narrow focus on the trade deficit. While China lags behind most other top trade partners and top large economies in its percentage of trade that is an export, its progress has been unrivaled.\nCould China have gotten to 30%? What about 40%? Could it still?\nWhat would China look like if its economy was able to buy an additional $800 billion in exports from the United States? Could the United States produce that much? Could it grow enough soybeans? Could Boeing manufacture enough jets? Could U.S. drug makers increase their output sufficiently? Could U.S. automakers, and even foreign automakers building cars in the United States and employing \u201cblue-collar\u201d Americans, produce enough cars?\nIt would, of course, extend beyond merchandise trade. American brands would be coveted. It would extend to service trade, to hotel chains, to restaurant chains, to movies, to our universities and to increased tourism in the United States.\nWhat a boost to the U.S. economy that would be.\nThat view, that a laser-sharp focus on increasing exports would be better than reducing the deficit, is no longer in vogue.\nAnd yet, despite all that, our trade has continued to grow, our imports have continued to grow, our exports have continued to grow, albeit more slowly, our trade deficit has continued to grow \u2013 and our percentage of trade that is an export has fallen."
