  "title": "Still See Single-Digit Upside to Stocks: Sundar",
  "description": "Sitara Sundar, Head of Alternative Investment Strategy at JPMorgan Private Bank, still sees upside to the market due to earnings growth and the broadening out of that growth. She speaks to Bloomberg's Katie Greifeld and Matt Miller on 'Open Interest.' (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "So let's talk about that. Bank of America is seeing this rush back into cash, basically people taking profit here. Does that fit with your view of the world and where the market currently is? So it's an interesting start to the year. I mean, really I mean, I say start to the year, but it's already August. But we've seen a couple of different dynamics take place where this push and pull between what is happening on in the economy versus what's happening in the markets. But we're still constructive. We actually just raised our midyear target for for next year, and we still see single digit upside, mid-single digit upside from here. And the reason for that is because earnings growth has been quite strong. And we always talk about how the markets in the economy are not the same thing. And we're starting to see that play out. And just take a look at this latest earnings season. Mm hmm. Earnings beat pretty handily. It was a low bar, to be fair. Right. Consensus came in expecting less than 5% year over year earnings growth for the quarter. And we're tracking near ten or 11%. But the interesting point is that earnings growth has not just been technology and the boost that we're seeing within artificial intelligence, but financials. Com services, we're seeing a little bit of breadth in that earnings growth. So when we think about our outlook moving forward, we're still constructive not just because earnings growth has been resilient, but because the areas of the market that we anticipate kind of pushing forward in that earnings growth is starting to broaden out, too. So expand on that. Where is it broadening out, too? Because as we have been talking about this morning, 80% of the gains that we've seen since April are driven by ten stocks. Yes. Now, if earnings growth is driven by more than that, then I guess you can deduct that The market isn't rewarding many other stocks for the kind of growth that you're expecting to see. Which are they? So financials is a big part of it. I think financials is one of the biggest sectors within the S & P 500. We're seeing a couple of things in terms of not just bank earnings being better than folks who are anticipating. But even when we look at the future outlook, there are a couple of secular tailwinds that are coming and giving some credence to the financials case as well. One, our expectation that the yield curve is likely going to steepen as a short end comes down in the long and stays anchored to the deregulation and deregulatory impulse that we're expecting to see in the second half of this year and early next year. And then three, perhaps equally importantly, is the reopening of capital markets. We're starting to see a pickup in IPO activity, M & A activity, and that's positive not just for financials, but private markets as well.",

  "summary": "Sundar Sundar: Despite a mixed start to the year, Bank of America is seeing a surge in earnings growth, despite this. Despite this, Sundar sees single-digit upside and mid-double potential for next year due to strong earnings growth. He suggests that this growth has been broadened out of technology, artificial intelligence, and financial services, highlighting the breadth of the earnings growth driven by financial services. Despite a recent earnings beat, he remains constructive and sees that the market is not rewarding many other stocks for the growth that he expects to see. Sundar also sees a potential for a steepening yield curve and increased capital market activity, suggesting that financials are likely to benefit from these trends. He notes that the reopening of capital markets is also contributing to a positive outlook for financials.",
  "shortSummary": "Despite strong earnings growth and market trends, Bank of America remains optimistic about future market upside, driven by broadening financials and deregulation, despite market volatility.",
