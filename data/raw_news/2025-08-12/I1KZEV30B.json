Generate Key Takeaways\n\nChanges may be on the horizon for Route 51 (Constitution Boulevard) and the Route 3016 Franklin Avenue interchange in Aliquippa.\n\nPennDOT says the potential changes will allow for safer access to downtown Aliquippa and the Aliquippa Industrial Park.\n\nAliquippa Mayor Dwan Walker says he would like to see the Route 51 land bridge demolished, and then the creation of an intersection with traffic lights.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m born and raised here, 50 years of my life. I\u2019ve been here and this has been a headache for the city as a whole and it\u2019s residents,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt\u2019s an all-hands-on-deck callout to get this done.\u201d\n\nWalker says this redesign could help open up Aliquippa and spur economic growth.\n\n\u201cInstead of just passing Aliquippa, you can actually take a visit to us,\u201d Walker said.\n\nWalker says the busy intersection gives drivers little space to accelerate and decelerate, including trucks from the industrial park. Walker says the intersection is also a prime spot for speeding.\n\nWalter says these changes are a matter of life and death.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had countless accidents, a loss of life, NyKasia Johnson. She lost her life and the goal is to name this street after her, to honor her,\u201d said Walker.\n\nPennDOT says the project could cost up to $19 million, with a projected start date in the spring of 2027.\n\nPennDOT and Walker encourage the public to voice their opinions on the proposed changes here.\n\nFollow Channel 11 News on Facebook and Twitter. | Watch WPXI NOW",
