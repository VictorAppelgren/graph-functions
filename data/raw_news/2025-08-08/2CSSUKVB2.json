  "title": "A federal program helps families eat healthy meals. Trump\u2019s new legislation cuts it.",
  "description": "Chalkbeat reports that Trump's legislation cuts SNAP-Ed funding, risking increased child hunger and reduced access to fresh produce for families.",
  "content": "On a sweltering afternoon this week, Ana Garcia, 41, and her three-year-old son, Elliott, arrived at the Goodhue Community Center on Staten Island to pick up their weekly haul of fresh, affordable produce.\n\nGarcia tasted a sample of tabbouleh salad. She and her son surveyed a spread of leafy greens, zucchini, summer squash, and peaches. For eight years, her family has returned regularly to buy a box of locally sourced produce. This week\u2019s box \u2014 priced at $14, or $7 for those with Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits \u2014 included a bounty of fresh fruit and vegetables, plus a recipe for tabbouleh.\n\nBut the Food Box program, administered by the nonprofit Children\u2019s Aid, may not exist much longer, Chalkbeat reports. President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d \u2014 passed by Congress and signed by Trump last week \u2014 eliminated funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Education, or SNAP-Ed, and made other changes to SNAP. SNAP-Ed, which funds nutrition education and anti-obesity initiatives nationwide, is set to expire on Sept. 30.\n\nThat will mean the disappearance of programs that help people on a limited budget eat healthier and shop smarter, teach children and families how to cook meals from scratch, and promote physically active lifestyles. Those efforts seem to align with the Trump administration\u2019s Make America Healthy Again, or MAHA, initiative, but will be impacted nonetheless.\n\nAdvocates are bracing for how the legislation will affect childhood hunger across the city and state. Changes to SNAP, including new eligibility rules, could result in hundreds of thousands of parents losing their food benefits. In all, New York state is facing up to $1.4 billion in annual SNAP cuts and cost shifts, with the state expected to start covering $1.2 billion for the program by October 2027.\n\n\u201cNot just in New York, but nationwide, we will see increases in child hunger,\u201d said Dr. Jennifer Cadenhead, a research assistant professor at Columbia\u2019s Teachers College, who focuses on diet, food quality, and food insecurity issues. \u201cThat really makes me sad.\u201d\n\nWhile SNAP cuts might affect free school meals in other districts, New York City\u2019s universal breakfast and lunch program is safe because the city\u2019s high poverty rate will continue to qualify the whole school system for the program. But individual families will likely be hit hard, which could in turn lead to higher absenteeism rates and affect student performance.\n\nOn Staten Island, Garcia said that the end of the Food Box program would mean less fresh produce in her family\u2019s diet \u2014 a loss for her two children.\n\n\u201cI want my kids to have all the vegetables,\u201d she said.\n\nEvery weekday morning, Chalkbeat New York is bringing thousands of subscribers the news on public schools and education policy that they need to start their day. Sign up for our free newsletter to join them.\n\nA roughly $536 million annual program with a 30-year history, SNAP-Ed is among the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s largest nutrition education programs. In a 2024 paper from the Journal of Nutrition Education and Behavior, researchers described it as a \u201ccritical pillar in the nation\u2019s public health infrastructure.\u201d Still, it\u2019s a fraction of SNAP\u2019s $99.8 billion in total spending in fiscal year 2024.\n\nBy offering evidence-based nutrition and food education, SNAP-Ed pays dividends for families\u2019 long-term health, said Cadenhead, of Teachers College.\n\n\u201cA lot of times, a doctor will say, \u2018You need to eat better,\u2019 but people don\u2019t know how,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t know how to prepare a balanced meal. They may not have time. They don\u2019t understand what they need to do, they can get overwhelmed in the grocery store.\u201d\n\nFunded with $29 million in federal dollars, New York\u2019s SNAP-Ed programs reached over 2.2 million individuals across the state last fiscal year, through efforts like Eat Well Play Hard. That program educates preschoolers on how their food is grown and encourages their caregivers to prepare and serve local produce to their families.\n\nDarren O\u2019Sullivan, a spokesperson for the state\u2019s Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, said in a statement that the federal legislation eliminating SNAP-Ed \u201cincreases the risk that New Yorkers in need will experience food insecurity, health issues, and economic hardship.\u201d\n\nThrough the $1 million grant Children\u2019s Aid gets through SNAP-Ed, the organization operates Food Box sites throughout the city, as well as programs in schools. Currently, the organization is running youth nutrition workshops and cooking demonstrations at Summer Rising sites, the city\u2019s free summer school program.\n\n\u201cWe hear from parents that their kids are coming home and asking, \u2018Can we make this recipe at home?\u2019\u201d said Taisy Conk, director of food and nutrition programs at Children\u2019s Aid. \u201cThis is opening up their palettes and their minds and getting them excited about it. It really makes an impact on children\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nThrough SNAP-Ed, Children\u2019s Aid brought nutrition education to 20 sites, including 11 schools last year. The organization analyzed its programs\u2019 impacts for the year before, and found that across its 176 workshops that reached nearly 430 kids, young people improved their vegetable consumption by 35%, with more than 60% reporting eating at least two fruits a day at the end of the course.\n\nConk said she worries that changes to SNAP will have far-reaching effects, with people assuming they\u2019re no longer eligible or struggling with new requirements. She said Children\u2019s Aid is urging the city and state to explore some bridge funding to keep the programs going and is looking to philanthropy to help plug the gaps.\n\nOn Staten Island, the Food Box stand was open during dismissal for a summer camp at the Goodhue Community Center. Some families stopped by to learn about the program or buy armfuls of corn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been great to have affordable produce,\u201d said Tara Messenger, 50, as she and her nine-year-old daughter collected their Food Box.\n\nWithout the Food Box program, Messenger, an art teacher, said she\u2019d have to rely more on her local grocery store, and they\u2019d likely eat more processed food.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be as fresh, as local, as affordable,\u201d she said. \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t have as many vegetables and fruits in our diet.\u201d\n\nSarah Kabalkin, 46, a local culinary educator, said she worried that cuts to SNAP would have a \u201cdevastating\u201d impact on her community, with more residents going hungry.\n\nLosing the Food Box program would affect her family, she said. Without their weekly boxes of fresh produce, Kabalkin said she\u2019d have to find a way to grow more in her community garden plots.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t produce this kind of variety,\u201d she said. \u201cSo it will limit what we\u2019re eating at home.\u201d\n\nThis story was produced by Chalkbeat and Healthbeat and reviewed and distributed by Stacker.",

      "text": "Sign up for Chalkbeat\u2019s free weekly newsletter to keep up with how education is changing across the U.S.\nRepublicans in Congress have approved President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping tax and domestic policy bill that will ramp up spending on immigration enforcement and make deep cuts to social safety net programs, with major ramifications for children and schools.\nThe bill, which the president is expected to sign by Friday, slashes spending on Medicaid, which provides health insurance to some 37 million children and is a critical revenue source for schools. It also limits eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which provides food assistance to over 13 million children and makes kids automatically eligible for free meals at school.\nThe legislation significantly raises spending on immigration enforcement, which will likely translate to more immigration arrests and deportations. The president\u2019s deportation campaign has already left schools working overtime to assure families it\u2019s safe to send their children to school.\n\u201cWhen you take it all together it\u2019s kind of like an assault on children and families policy-wise,\u201d said Megan Curran, the director of policy at the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see that the effects reverberate well beyond what we\u2019re even understanding\u201d right now, she said, \u201cand schools are going to be on the front lines.\u201d\nThe nearly 900-page bill also creates a new voucher-like program that will pay for private school scholarships \u2014 a major victory for school choice advocates who have successfully expanded similar programs in several states, but have previously failed to enact a nationwide version. States will be allowed to opt out, however, and it\u2019s likely many Democrat-led states will.\nHere is more on how what the president calls the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d is likely to affect children and schools:\nMedicaid cuts will hurt school budgets\nTrump\u2019s policy bill makes historic cuts to Medicaid, which is the fourth-largest source of federal funding for schools. If millions of children lost their health insurance, it would undoubtedly reduce funding for schools, though it\u2019s unclear by how much.\n\u201cCutting Medicaid is equivalent to cutting school district budgets,\u201d said Jessie Mandle, the national program director at the nonprofit Healthy Schools Campaign. \u201cSchool districts are very much aware of how important Medicaid dollars are to serve students with disabilities, address the youth mental crisis, [and] address students\u2019 behavioral health needs.\u201d\nIn March, Mandle\u2019s organization and other education groups surveyed 1,400 school staffers and officials from across the U.S. about how they rely on Medicaid. Around 9 in 10 respondents used Medicaid to pay the salaries of school health staff, such as school nurses, psychologists, and speech therapists. A little under half relied on Medicaid to buy assistive technology and other specialized equipment for students with disabilities.\nCuts to Medicaid would likely require schools to lay off staff and make cuts elsewhere in their budgets, the survey found.\nAnd schools in rural communities, where a higher share of kids are enrolled in Medicaid and schools often play a big role in providing health care, are likely to feel the cuts more acutely.\nSNAP cuts could limit free school meals\nThe federal legislation makes a series of changes to the SNAP program, including requiring more parents of school-aged children and teens aging out of foster care to work, scrapping eligibility for refugees and people who\u2019ve been granted asylum, and raising how much states have to kick in.\nThe changes could result in hundreds of thousands of parents losing their SNAP benefits, which could have ripple effects on schools \u2014 though earlier provisions that would have more directly targeted the school meal program were stripped out of the bill.\nWhen kids are enrolled in SNAP, they automatically qualify for free breakfast and lunch at school. And when a high share of kids are enrolled in SNAP, it\u2019s more financially viable for schools to provide free meals to all students. That has a number of academic and social benefits for kids.\nIf families fall off the SNAP rolls, they may not realize they have to fill out paperwork at their child\u2019s school to get free meals. And if fewer kids qualify for free school meals, schools will get a lower reimbursement from the federal government, which will make it harder to cover the cost of providing free meals to all kids.\n\u201cThe cuts to SNAP that are currently proposed will increase hunger in homes and in classrooms,\u201d said Erin Hysom, the senior child nutrition policy analyst for the nonprofit Food Research & Action Center. \u201cIt\u2019s really going to be this kind of double whammy for families.\u201d\nBoost for immigration enforcement likely to affect schools\nThe president\u2019s policy bill includes $31 billion in additional funding for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to hire more agents and cover the cost of deportations. The legislation also includes $13 billion in grants for states and local communities to assist with immigration enforcement.\nAn increase in immigration enforcement is likely to put additional burdens on school communities, many of which have already spent time and resources tending to students whose family members were arrested, advocating on behalf of students who were detained, and adding transportation and safety measures to assuage the fears of immigrant parents.\nRecent research from Stanford University found that raids carried out by the Trump administration earlier this year in California\u2019s Central Valley notably increased daily absences from school, especially for younger children. And earlier research has found that immigration raids have significant effects on children\u2019s physical and mental health, as well as on broader school climate.\nNew voucher-like program will pay for private schooling\nTucked into the bill is the creation of a tax-credit scholarship program that will pay for private school tuition. Individuals can knock $1,700 off their tax bill if they donate that amount to an organization that awards scholarships to kids who attend private school.\nThe inclusion is a win for private school choice advocates who have long championed an idea like this.\nBut the program will be optional for states, after the Senate parliamentarian ruled states could not be required to participate. That will probably curb the program\u2019s impact, because it\u2019s unlikely that Democrat-led states \u2014 where officials have vociferously opposed using public money for private schools \u2014 will opt in.\nIt is unclear exactly how much the federal voucher-like program will cost, as there is no cap on the amount of tax credit payouts. (An earlier House version would have capped those costs at around $5 billion to $6 billion a year.)\nMany states have their own tax-credit scholarship or voucher program.\nPell Grants now available for workforce training\nStarting with the 2026-27 school year, students from low-income backgrounds who\u2019d normally qualify for a federal Pell Grant to pay for college can get aid for short-term workforce training.\nKnown as a Workforce Pell Grant, the money could be spent on training programs that last eight to 15 weeks and lead to some kind of credential or academic credit toward a degree or certificate program. The idea has gotten bipartisan support in Congress, and has been endorsed by both Trump and Education Secretary Linda McMahon.\nThe training would need to prepare students for jobs or industries that are high-skill, high-wage, or in-demand \u2014 in line with the federal Perkins Career and Technical Education Act \u2014 and governors and state school boards would decide which programs qualify.\nThe Congressional Budget Office expects the program will be relatively small to start: Just $17 million in the first year and $20 million the following year.\nChild tax credit bump excludes many low-income families\nThe bill increases the size of the credit from $2,000 to $2,200 a year, but does nothing to ensure more low-income families can benefit.\nThat means the child tax credit is actually \u201cless generous\u201d in today\u2019s dollars than when the $2,000 credit began in 2018, because it was never adjusted for inflation, said Curran of Columbia University.\nA July analysis by Curran and others found that 19 million children are in families who would get only some, or none, of the revised tax credit because they don\u2019t earn enough money. That\u2019s up from 17 million children who don\u2019t fully benefit from the current child tax credit.\nThe final result is \u201chead-scratching,\u201d Curran said, after all of the bipartisan enthusiasm to expand and increase the child tax credit.\nDuring the pandemic, the federal government temporarily raised the credit to $3,000 per child and $3,600 for younger children, and made it available to many more families with low or no income. There\u2019s solid evidence that helped many families stay on top of household bills and pay for school supplies and other items for their children.\nBut the bill Trump is about to sign does not include those changes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge pendulum swing,\u201d Curran said. \u201cThe child tax credit doesn\u2019t really do anything extra for families.\u201d\nKalyn Belsha is a senior national education reporter based in Chicago.

This could lead to increased childhood hunger and reduced access to healthy food for many families, as advocates warn that changes to SNAP may result in hundreds of thousands losing their benefits. The program, which has been crucial for nutrition education and access to fresh produce, is at risk, raising concerns about the long-term health impacts on children.",
