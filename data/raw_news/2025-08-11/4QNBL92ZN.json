  "content": "President Donald Trump on Monday nominated E.J. Antoni to be the new commissioner for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that collects and publishes data about jobs and inflation, after firing the previous commissioner, whom he accused without evidence of rigging jobs data.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to announce that I am nominating Highly Respected Economist, Dr. E.J. Antoni, as the next Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics,\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.\n\nAntoni is currently the chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. He has been an outspoken critic of BLS and its approach to data collection in the past.\n\nAntoni\u2019s nomination comes after Trump fired Dr. Erika McEntarfer earlier this month after the BLS\u2019 monthly jobs report showed disappointing numbers for July and sharply revised down employment growth in May and June.\n\nTrump accused McEntarfer, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden to the role of commissioner in 2023 and confirmed by a bipartisan Senate vote, of manipulating the data for \u201cpolitical purposes.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast weeks Job\u2019s Report was RIGGED,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media site Truth Social last week. \u201cThose big adjustments were made to cover up, and level out, the FAKE political numbers that were CONCOCTED in order to make a great Republican Success look less stellar!!!\u201d\n\nMcEntarfer\u2019s firing was met with backlash from many economists who argued that the move could damage the bureau\u2019s credibility.\n\nWilliam Beach, a former Trump-nominated BLS commissioner, condemned the decision to fire McEntarfer.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any grounds at all for this, for this firing, and it really hurts the statistical system,\u201d Beach said on CNN earlier this month before Antoni was appointed. \u201cSuppose that they get a new commissioner \u2026 And they do a bad number. Well, everybody\u2019s going to think, \u2018well, it\u2019s not as bad as it probably really is,\u2019 because they\u2019re going to suspect political influence. So, this is damaging.\u201d\n\nThe BLS is a nonpartisan agency whose data underpins key decisions across the public and private sectors. Its reports influence everything from Social Security payments to corporate hiring and layoff plans, shaping how policymakers and businesses gauge the health of the US economy.\n\nConcerns over the bureau\u2019s data accuracy had surfaced even before McEntarfer\u2019s firing, with some economists warning that Trump administration budget cuts, layoffs and hiring freezes could undermine its reliability.\n\nEarlier this year, the BLS posted a notice saying it had suspended data collection entirely in three cities. Last month, the agency said it had further cut back on the data it was collecting from the rest of the country by roughly 15%.\n\nIn July, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell was asked about the cuts.\n\n\u201cThe government data is really the gold standard in data,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need it to be good and to be able to rely on it.\u201d",

      "text": "President Donald Trump has fired Dr. Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, whom he accused, without evidence, of manipulating the monthly jobs reports for \u201cpolitical purposes.\u201d\nThe BLS\u2019 monthly labor report Friday showed that the US economy added only 73,000 jobs in July, far below expectations. It also sharply revised down the employment growth that had been previously reported in May and June \u2013 by a combined 258,000 jobs.\nAfter the revisions, the jobs report showed the weakest pace of hiring for any three-month period since the pandemic recession in 2020.\n\u201cIn my opinion, today\u2019s Jobs Numbers were RIGGED in order to make the Republicans, and ME, look bad,\u201d Trump said in a Truth Social post.\nAlthough the May and June jobs numbers were worse than initially believed, revisions are normal in this process. The BLS\u2019 initial monthly jobs estimates are often based on incomplete data, so they are revised twice after the initial report \u2014 followed by an annual revision every February. Additionally, BLS economists use a formula to smooth out jobs numbers for seasonal variations and that can exacerbate revisions when they fall outside economists\u2019 expectations.\nTrump on Friday incorrectly called the revisions a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\u201cMcEntarfer said there were only 73,000 Jobs added (a shock!) but, more importantly, that a major mistake was made by them, 258,000 Jobs downward, in the prior two months,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social. \u201cSimilar things happened in the first part of the year, always to the negative. The Economy is BOOMING under \u2018TRUMP.\u2019\u201d\nTrump said McEntarfer \u201cfaked\u201d the jobs numbers before the election to try to boost former Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 chances in the 2024 presidential election.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing so well. I believe the numbers were phony, just like they were before the election, and there were other times. So, you know what I did? I fired her, and you know what? I did the right thing,\u201d Trump told reporters Friday on the South Lawn.\nMcEntarfer was confirmed by the Senate 86-8 in January 2024 for a term of four years. CNN has reached out to McEntarfer for comment. Until Trump replaces McEntarfer, Deputy Commissioner William Wiatrowski will serve as Acting Commissioner, the administration said.\nTrump has previously criticized the BLS for its jobs data and revisions, and he told reporters Friday evening he\u2019s \u201calways had a problem with these numbers.\u201d In 2016, during his first presidential campaign, Trump claimed that the unemployment rate was significantly higher than the BLS let on. In 2024, he accused former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration of orchestrating a cover-up, after the BLS reported that it had overcounted jobs by 818,000 over the previous 12 months.\n\u201cI was thinking about it this morning, before the numbers that came out. I said, \u2018Who is the person that does these numbers?\u2019 And then they gave me stats about before the election,\u201d Trump said Friday.\n\u201cWe need people that we can trust,\u201d he added.\nBut Trump and his administration have also praised the BLS data when it has been favorable to them. During Trump\u2019s first term, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in March 2017 that the jobs data was no longer \u201cphony\u201d after the BLS issued a strong jobs report. And a month ago, current White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on social media that the economy had beat expectations for jobs in four straight BLS labor reports.\n\u2018Deeply worrisome\u2019\nThe BLS is nonpartisan, and businesses and government officials rely on the accuracy of its data to make determinations about investment, hiring, spending and all sorts of key decisions.\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous for anyone in government to question the integrity of the BLS,\u201d said Jason Furman, a Harvard professor and former Obama economic adviser. \u201cAccurate statistics are essential to the economy.\u201d\nFurman doubted that replacing McEntarfer would compromise the BLS, but he said even the possibility or appearance of that notion \u201cwould be bad.\u201d\n\u201cCountries that have tried to fake those statistics have often ended up with economic crises as a result,\u201d Furman said.\nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, said the BLS\u2019 data is at the \u201chighest standard,\u201d and \u201cas accurate as it can be.\u201d\n\u201cAnything that undermines that or even the perception of that high standard is deeply worrisome,\u201d Zandi said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything even close to this.\u201d\nAt Moody\u2019s, Zandi said he has hired a number of former BLS economists whom he called \u201cfantastic.\u201d\n\u201cThey do great work,\u201d Zandi said. \u201cThey are critical to a well-functioning economy.\u201d\nDemocratic Virginia Senator Mark Warner accused Trump of working the referees.\n\u201cFiring the ump doesn\u2019t change the score,\u201d Warner said in a statement. \u201cAmericans deserve to know the truth about the state of the Trump economy.\u201d\nBut Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a post on social media that she supports replacing McEntarfer.\n\u201cA recent string of major revisions have come to light and raised concerns about decisions being made by the Biden-appointed Labor Commissioner,\u201d Chavez-DeRemer said on X. \u201cI support the President\u2019s decision to replace Biden\u2019s Commissioner and ensure the American People can trust the important and influential data coming from BLS.\u201d\nConcerns about cuts\nThe BLS jobs survey is widely considered by economists to be robust. It samples more than 100,000 businesses and government agencies each month, representing roughly 629,000 individual worksites.\nBut, as part of larger cost-cutting taking place around practically every part of Trump\u2019s government, the BLS is laying off staff \u2014 and, as a result, reducing the scope of its work.\nFor example, the BLS posted a notice in June stating it stopped collecting data for its Consumer Price Index in three cities (Lincoln, Nebraska; Buffalo, New York; and Provo, Utah) and increased \u201cimputations\u201d for certain items (a statistical technique that, when boiled down to very rough terms, essentially means more educated guesses).\nThat worried Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. In testimony before Congress in June, Powell said he believed the BLS data to be accurate, but he was upset about what could become a trend.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that I\u2019m concerned about the data today, although there has been a very mild degradation of the scope of the surveys,\u201d Powell said at the time, in response to a question about survey data quality. \u201cBut I would say the direction of travel is something I\u2019m concerned about.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with additional developments and context."

      "text": "The Consumer Price Index is more than just the most widely used inflation gauge and a measurement of Americans\u2019 purchasing power.\nIts robust data plays a key role in the US economy\u2019s trajectory as well as monthly mortgage payments, Social Security checks, financial aid packages, business contracts, pay negotiations and curiosity salves for those who wonder what Kevin McCallister\u2019s $19.83 grocery bill in \u201cHome Alone\u201d might cost today.\nHowever, this gold standard piece of economic data has become a little less precise recently: The Bureau of Labor Statistics posted a notice on Wednesday stating that it stopped collecting data in three not-so-small cities (Lincoln, Nebraska; Buffalo, New York; and Provo, Utah) and increased \u201cimputations\u201d for certain items (a statistical technique that, when boiled down to very rough terms, essentially means more educated guesses).\nThe BLS notice states that the collection reductions \u201cmay increase the volatility of subnational or item-specific indexes\u201d and are expected to have \u201cminimal impact\u201d on the overall index.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s drastic cutbacks of government spending and the federal workforce have economists, researchers and statisticians sounding the alarm that the reliability and accuracy of economic data could become a casualty to those efforts.\n\u201cThe BLS\u2019s need to infer more data points due to personnel and funding constraints is deeply concerning,\u201d Gregory Daco, EY-Parthenon\u2019s chief economist, told CNN. \u201cIt raises legitimate questions about the reliability and timeliness of critical economic indicators.\u201d\nWhile statistical agencies often have protocols to maintain data quality during short disruptions, any sustained underfunding could \u201cdegrade the foundational data used for policymaking, market analysis and business planning,\u201d he said.\nBLS officials did not respond to questions posed by CNN and instead referred to the notice and related links on response rates and collections.\nIn the early days of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term in office, federal websites went dark and data disappeared as the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency set its sights on streamlining the government. That further heightened concerns as to whether the nation\u2019s statistical infrastructure \u2014 which already has been in a precarious state in terms of funding, response rates and public trust \u2014 was at risk of crumbling.\nTrump\u2019s fiscal 2026 budget proposal includes an 8% reduction to BLS funding and staffing.\nTo what extent the CPI reductions are a sign of what\u2019s to come remains to be seen; but the immediate impacts to inflation readings could be minimal for now, Alan Detmeister, a UBS senior economist who previously helmed the Fed\u2019s Wages and Prices section, told CNN.\n\u201cTheir statement said that this will have little impact on the aggregate index, which is quite possible; but up to this point, they have not put out enough information that we would need to really evaluate \u2014 we don\u2019t have any numbers on how [the reductions] are distributed, except for a few locations they stopped sampling,\u201d he said.\nThe reductions likely won\u2019t affect the long-run increases or decreases in inflation and, because of that, don\u2019t seem to be politically motivated, he added.\n\u201cWhat it does mean is that since they\u2019re using fewer observations, there\u2019s likely to be a little bit more noise in the monthly CPI data,\u201d he said. \u201cHow much more noise? We don\u2019t really know.\u201d\nDetmeister flagged the imputations anomalies in a note to clients earlier this week, noting that the share of imputed prices jumped 15% in March (the highest level since the pandemic rattled the economy in April 2020), and then surged even more in April, by 29%.\nIt\u2019s not yet clear whether the CPI has become less reliable, but what is certain is that any weirdness or hitches in the data is happening at a bad time, he added.\n\u201cAny time you\u2019re using fewer observations, it creates a bit of an issue; the real concern is if these types of surprises continue to occur, and the number of observations continues to be reduced,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you see it occurring in other statistics as well, it just makes our view of what\u2019s going on in the economy slightly worse.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re really scrutinizing all the price data every month to see if there are impacts of the tariffs coming through; so, the timing isn\u2019t ideal.\u201d\nThe CPI for May will be released Wednesday next week."
