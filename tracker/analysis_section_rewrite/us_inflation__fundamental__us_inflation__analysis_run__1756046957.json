      "feedback": "You’ve made a solid start, but to reach world‑class you need a clean, regime‑based, first‑principles frame that links Ford’s micro‑finance signals to multi‑year macro dynamics and market pricing. Actionable edits: (1) replace the current narrative knots with a multi‑year regime map anchored in first principles (real rate differentials, inflation/policy regime, productivity/TA growth, terms of trade, BoP/net external position) and clearly spell the regime transitions (e.g., tariff pass‑through dynamics + EV profitability regime shift); (2) specify a formal causal chain from tariff/deviation in inflation expectations to pricing multiples, discount rates, and dividend‑yields, then tie Ford’s metrics (forward P/E ~8, dividend yield ~5%, Q2 EV loss ~$1.3B, capex up to $50B through 2026) to that chain with explicit state‑dependence; (3) restructure into a current environment snapshot plus a multi‑year base/optimistic/pessimistic scenario set, each with a base case explicit numbers path (e.g., modest mid‑single‑digit earnings growth, 2–4% long‑run earnings growth if EV profitability improves vs. sustained pressure otherwise); (4) elevate catalysts/triggers and invalidation points with tight, sourced references: EV segment profitability turning (Ford Model E), EV capex pacing and capacity signals, tariff outcomes and pass‑through, and EV competition intensity (as discussed in 22PL3Q360 and W2622L6WW); (5) quantify the risk/reward in numbers rather than qualitative platitudes, citing precise figures from UNH/LULU moves as broader signal (UNH down ~42% YTD; LULU down ~47%; UNH FCF yield >9% and ~3% dividend; LULU cash/debt profile from IGP1Q4ZEJ); (6) integrate the Burry/Macro‑context thread as a cross‑section of how durable moats and balance sheets can re‑rate over years, but avoid conflating their moves with Ford’s core drivers unless you treat them as cross‑asset regime signals (cite IGP1Q4ZEJ); (7) prune sources that aren’t critical for the regime analysis (e.g., the tire article JHGBQ4TQH unless you use it as a generic illustration of consumer‑durables cyclicality) and solve any conflicts by presenting explicit bounds and sensitivity ranges (e.g., EV profitability timing window, tariff pass‑through elasticity). Ensure every substantive claim plugs to IDs in SOURCE MATERIAL (W2622L6WW for Ford fundamentals, 22PL3Q360 for auto/EV/tariff context, IGP1Q4ZEJ for Burry’s positioning, YVQU6QCY4 for macro retirement/discounted cash flow implications, and UNH/LULU specifics from IGP1Q4ZEJ). The base case should read as a coherent, transition‑conditioned forecast rather than a set of disconnected bullets; emphasize what to watch (tariff posture, EV cadence, capex pacing, MOAT durability, dividend sustainability) and conclude with a calibrated confidence band (e.g., moderate confidence on a tempered, yield‑driven equity path, with higher downside if tariff/EV hurdles intensify).",
