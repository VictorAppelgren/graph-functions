      "text": "StubHub, the ticketing marketplace that spun out of eBay in 2020, has resumed its plans to go public and is now aiming to hold its IPO next month, CNBC has learned.\nThe company originally paused its IPO plans in April as the stock market was reeling from President Donald Trump's \"liberation day\" tariffs. The decision came after StubHub submitted its prospectus in March indicating it would list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker \"STUB.\"\nStubHub now expects to kick off its IPO roadshow after Labor Day, Sept. 1, and make its debut later in the month, according to a source familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the discussions are confidential.\nThe company declined to comment.\nStubHub also filed an updated IPO prospectus on Monday. It reported revenue growth in the first quarter of 10% from a year earlier to $397.6 million. Operating income came in at $26.8 million for the period, after the company lost $883,000 in the year-ago period, but its net loss widened to $35.9 million from $29.7 million a year ago.\nThe IPO market has come to life in recent months after an extended dry spell due to high inflation and rising interest rates. A flurry of startups have made their public debuts, including rocket maker Firefly Aerospace, design software company Figma, crypto firm Circle and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave. Bullish, the cryptocurrency exchange that counts Peter Thiel as an investor, also filed its IPO prospectus last month.\nStubHub has been a longtime player in the ticketing industry since its launch in 2000. It was purchased by eBay for $310 million in 2007, but was reacquired by its co-founder Eric Baker in 2020 for $4 billion through his new company Viagogo.\nThe company had sought a $16.5 billion valuation before it began the IPO process, CNBC previously reported. StubHub didn't provide an expected pricing range for its shares in the filing.\nAs it prepares to go public, StubHub is contending with hefty competition in the online ticketing market. In addition to Ticketmaster, which is owned by Live Nation, StubHub is up against secondary market companies, including Vivid Seats, SeatGeek and TicketNetwork\nFor the first quarter, StubHub reported gross merchandise sales of $2.08 billion, up 15% from a year prior. That was a slowdown from 47% expansion the previous quarter. StubHub said GMS, or the total value paid by buyers for tickets and fulfillment, builds in each quarter and that initial sales for major concert tours typically occur near the end of the year."

Executives said the market\u2019s mood had picked up after the uncertainty caused by the announcements of tariffs in April, according to the report.\n\u201cWe could be shocked again tomorrow, who knows, but certainly the market sentiment now is more positive than it was in early April,\u201d Raymond James CEO Paul Shoukry said, per the report.\nIt was reported June 8 that IPOs remained scarce, with just nine private equity-backed IPOs at that point in the year in Europe and the United States, compared to 116 in the same period in 2021.\nIn January, it was reported that while there had been hopeful reports about an IPO resurgence, some Wall Street analysts were urging caution following a lukewarm reaction to natural gas firm Venture Global\u2019s valuation target for its IPO.\nThe company had hoped for a $110 billion price tag but settled for a 45% downgrade when it sold its shares. One analyst said at the time that IPO investors were \u201cscrutinizing deals carefully.\u201d\nEarlier in January, it was reported that investment bankers were preparing for a dealmaking uptick in equity capital markets fueled by a promising stable of IPOs by high-profile companies and rising capital markets activity driven by greater economic confidence."
