      "feedback": "The draft is on the right track but remains too narrow and lightly sourced. Tighten the causal chain by explicitly linking the EPAM upgrade → 0.1–0.2 % spx lift → ~5–10 bp 10‑yr yield tightening through a *risk‑premium* mechanism (equity‑to‑bond rebalancing). Quantify the risk‑premium shift (e.g., a 20 bp drop in the equity‑bond spread would compress yields by ~3 bp) and cite a recent empirical study or Bloomberg/Reuters data. Add macro anchors: Fed policy stance (e.g., “Fed’s dovish minutes in June 2025” → 10‑yr yield +2 bp) and inflation expectations (CPI/PCP data → 10‑yr yield +3 bp). Provide a concise watch‑list with dates: EPAM Q2 earnings (Jul 15 2025), Fed minutes (Jun 30 2025), CPI release (Jun 12 2025), 10‑yr yield trend (weekly). Remove generic “risk‑premium” phrasing without numbers; replace with concrete spread/price data. Ensure every claim has an inline citation (use H86O3XRUJ for the EPAM upgrade, add new IDs for Fed minutes and CPI). Finally, confirm the draft maps to canonical handles (spx, ust10y) with explicit sign/magnitude and a catalyst window (next earnings/ Fed minutes). This will elevate the analysis to a defensible, actionable view.",
