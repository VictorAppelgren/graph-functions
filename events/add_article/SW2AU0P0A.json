      "summary": "Mortgage rates are flat but have been falling over the last month, with the 30‑year at 6.41% and the 15‑year at 5.55%. The Fed has cut rates in 2024 but has held them in 2025, and an 87% chance of a September cut could keep rates steady. Buyers are advised to shop lenders early, consider 15‑year terms or ARMs for lower rates, and weigh refinancing options. Market expectations suggest rates will remain above 6% through 2025, with limited drops in 2026.",
