  "description": "After four years of vegan cuisine, the fine-dining stalwart Eleven Madison Park is cooking animals again.",
  "content": "A few years ago, during the coronavirus pandemic, Daniel Humm had an epiphany. Human reliance on animal products was cooking the planet, and, as a chef, reducing his reliance on them could be part of a solution. When his New York City restaurant, Eleven Madison Park\u2014which had once been named the world\u2019s best restaurant\u2014reopened, it would be free of animal products, making it the first three-Michelin-star dining room to bear that distinction.\n\nHumm seemed reinvigorated by the change, and very, very eager to talk about it. \u201cFrom a creative place,\u201d he told his friend Gabriela Hearst in Interview magazine at the time, \u201cthe world does not need another dry-aged ribeye or butter-poached lobster.\u201d He went on The Tonight Show and Morning Joe; he released an illustrated journal featuring observations such as \u201cour cooking should not conform to society,\u201d as well as his own hand-drawn portraits of lentils, broccoli, and a popsicle, rendered in a rustic, neo-Expressionist-by-way-of-nursery-school style. He talked about going plant-based as both an ethical and an artistic imperative. \u201cIt became very clear to me that our idea of what luxury is had to change,\u201d Humm said at the time. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t go back to doing what we did before.\u201d He would make a small but decisive correction to a food system that was \u201csimply not sustainable.\u201d\n\nFour years later, vegan luxury dining is apparently the thing that wasn\u2019t sustainable. Yesterday, Humm announced that, after creating \u201ca new culinary language,\u201d building \u201csomething meaningful,\u201d and igniting \u201ca debate that transcended food,\u201d he will go back to speaking his previous culinary language. Eleven Madison Park will continue to offer a plant-based menu, but will also serve \u201cselect animal products for certain dishes.\u201d These select animal products, he said, will include \u201cfish\u201d and \u201cmeat.\u201d And \u201choney-lavender-glazed duck.\u201d And oysters, and lobster. Also, chicken, maybe.\n\nIn an interview with The New York Times, Humm said he was moved to return animals to the menu for reasons of inclusion. \u201cI very much believed in the all-in approach, but I didn\u2019t realize that we would exclude people,\u201d he said. \u201cI have some anxiety that people are going to say, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s a hypocrite,\u2019 but I know that the best way to continue to champion plant-based cooking is to let everyone participate around the table.\u201d Elsewhere in the piece, he was somewhat more direct: Diners had become less interested in what Humm was offering. Sales of wine\u2014which tends to come with a heavy markup and is thus a highly important part of many restaurants\u2019 business\u2014were down, because people seemed to be less inclined to uncork a $1,500 bottle of C\u00f4te-R\u00f4tie when a big bloody steak wasn\u2019t also involved. Bookings for EMP\u2019s private events were also flagging, Humm said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get 30 people for a corporate dinner to come to a plant-based restaurant.\u201d\n\nWell, yeah. The thing is, people really, really like meat. All the time, but especially when they\u2019re paying up to $365 a head for dinner before tax, tip, and beverages. Between 2014 and 2024, annual per capita meat consumption rose\u2014even as various publications heralded the end of beef, even as the consequences of climate change became even more unignorable, even before the secretary of health started telling people to eat tallow. Sales of plant-based meat have been declining since 2021, according to the Good Food Institute, a nonprofit devoted to alternative proteins. In June, the CEO of Impossible Foods, which sells high-tech meat substitutes, told The Wall Street Journal that his company was considering taking an approach similar to Humm\u2019s, developing a half-beef burger. Though plenty of animal-free restaurants seem to be doing perfectly well, in fine dining they may be the exception rather than the rule. Of the United States\u2019 263 Michelin-starred restaurants, just four are exclusively vegetarian or vegan. Americans just cannot seem to quit meat, no matter how good the alternative tastes.\n\nRead: Everything can be meat\n\nBut then again, part of Humm\u2019s problem might have been that his alternative didn\u2019t taste very good. When Pete Wells, then the New York Times\u2019 restaurant critic, went to EMP in 2021, he found food that he described as \u201cacrid\u201d and \u201cdistorted,\u201d including an extraordinarily fussy-sounding beet dish that \u201ctastes like Lemon Pledge and smells like a burning joint.\u201d The people who are willing to shell out hundreds of dollars for food tend to pay attention to reviews, and they tend to want to feel like they\u2019re getting what they\u2019ve paid for. What happens in fine-dining restaurants does, eventually, trickle down to the rest of the food industry, but the problem with appointing yourself as an agent for the revolution is that then you really need people to buy what you are selling. And you can only be one of the world\u2019s most influential restaurants if you are making enough money to stay open.\n\nThe idea of a place such as Eleven Madison Park being on the vanguard of social change was funny even before it was revealed to be temporary. A nice meal is fundamentally a luxury good\u2014one where no expense is spared, customers are always comfortable, the linens get washed every day, and the appeal is a sense of perfection. It is the opposite of sacrifice, which is what responding to climate change will require from all of us. Humm is right, of course\u2014meat really is unsustainable. So is hubris.",

  "summary": "Daniel Humm, chef at Eleven Madison Park in New York City, has decided to reduce his reliance on animal products in an effort to reduce environmental impact. The restaurant, which had previously been named the world\u2019s best restaurant, will be free of animal products when it reopens, making it the first three-Michelin-star dining room to have this distinction. Humm's decision was seen as a significant step towards creating a new culinary language and engaging in a debate that transcends food. Despite this, sales of plant-based meat have been declining since 2021. Despite these efforts, Humm remains committed to promoting plant-free dining and creating a more engaging approach.",

      "text": "The Meat Paradox\nVegetarianism is more popular than ever\u2014but so is meat consumption. How can this be?\nHow do you persuade the whole world to stop eating meat?\nI have been trying for half a century. My book Animal Liberation was published in 1975, when I was 29 years old. I argued that our treatment of animals is ethically unjustifiable: If it\u2019s wrong to cause unnecessary suffering, then it\u2019s wrong regardless of the sufferer\u2019s species. On that basis, I urged readers to stop eating meat. Though I described how animals are forced to endure extreme suffering on factory farms and in laboratories, my appeal was to rationality, not emotion. I believed I had proved that there was no reasonable defense for animal cruelty.\nAt the time, my position was widely considered radical, even bizarre. Today it\u2019s mainstream. And yet the paradoxical fact remains: Even as the ethical arguments for avoiding meat have become better known, meat consumption has risen not only in countries that are emerging out of poverty, but in the U.S. as well. I never could have predicted that vegan living and carnivorousness might rise in tandem in the same society. What should we make of that?\nI have been asking myself this question recently while working on Animal Liberation Now, which renews and updates my earlier book. The process has made me wonder what my younger self would have thought if he had known that, 48 years later, meat consumption would be higher than ever.\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to expect from the publication of Animal Liberation. It began as an essay in The New York Review of Books. Robert Silvers, the magazine\u2019s legendary editor, told me that my arguments persuaded him to give up meat. This was immensely encouraging. If I, an academic philosopher, could win over the editor of what was then America\u2019s preeminent publication for progressive ideas, surely millions of other converts would swiftly follow. It seemed reasonable to hope that the market for the products of factory farms would soon shrink or even collapse.\nMeasured against those expectations, Animal Liberation was a failure. Some of the rise in meat eating simply tracks population growth and increased prosperity in countries, like China, whose citizens were once too poor to afford meat. But even in the United States, per capita consumption of meat and poultry is 24 percent higher than it was in 1975. The average American is eating less beef, but that has been more than offset by higher consumption of chicken and turkey. That\u2019s even worse from an animal-welfare perspective. More birds must be raised and killed to produce the same quantity of meat, and they are raised in more crowded and intensive conditions than cows are.\nAt the same time, I would have been pleased to know that the book would succeed at changing minds. Back in the early 1970s, the treatment of animals was a nonissue, especially on the political left, where it was seen as a sentimental concern limited to animal lovers. Animal Liberation seems to have helped change that. Ingrid Newkirk, the founder of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, has written that the book \u201cmade people\u2014myself included\u2014change what we ate, what we wore, and how we perceived animals.\u201d\nIn the decades since, the animal-welfare movement has achieved important reforms, especially in Europe. The European Union and the United Kingdom have prohibited keeping hens in bare wire cages that prevent them from stretching their wings. Veal calves and breeding sows used to be housed in stalls so narrow that they were unable to turn around or walk more than a single step; that is now also illegal. These changes fall far short of what is needed but they give hundreds of millions of animals a better life.\nPerhaps the most obvious change is cultural: In the West, there are far more vegetarians today than there were in 1975. I did not dare advocate going vegan in the original version of Animal Liberation, because it seemed too extreme. Today, avoiding all animal products isn\u2019t so daring.\nCan we attribute this shift to the success of ethical arguments? Recent experimental evidence suggests that they did play a role. In 2016, the philosopher Eric Schwitzgebel invited me to collaborate on a study designed to test whether a single discussion about the ethics of eating meat would make students more likely to choose vegetarian meals. Eric thought it would not. Based on my anecdotal experience, I thought it might.\nWe randomly divided more than 1,000 undergraduate students at UC Riverside into two equal groups. One was assigned to read an article arguing, on ethical grounds, against eating meat from factory farms, which was followed by a small-group discussion and an optional video advocating avoiding meat. The other, the control group, got a similar lesson plan about donating money to help people in poverty. Because many students at Riverside use their student-ID cards to pay for meals, we could track their food choices after the lessons. Meat consumption stayed the same for the control group, but declined among those in the group that discussed animal ethics. Another recent study found similar results using arguments about meat consumption\u2019s role in global warming, rather than animal suffering. Remarkably, the researchers found that the effect persisted three years later.\nThe most awkward conversations I have had since publishing Animal Liberation have not been with people who reject my arguments, but with those who tell me that they think I\u2019m right\u2014and continue to eat meat anyway. I have always known that ethics are not paramount for everyone all the time. Only a bold person would claim that they always do what they believe to be right, no matter the sacrifice. Still, I will never forget when, shortly after I arrived at Princeton, a new colleague told me at dinner that she agreed with my views about the treatment of animals. She told me this, you see, over the factory-farmed chicken she had just ordered from a menu that included the perfectly adequate vegan meal I was enjoying.\nMy older, wiser, and reluctantly realistic self now accepts that most people can easily continue doing something they believe is wrong as long as they have plenty of company. I suspect that when these people say they agree with my views, what they\u2019re really saying is that they care about animal welfare and climate change, but they\u2019re not going to adjust their individual habits until everyone else does.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that ethical arguments are useless. It means, rather, that their effect is felt most powerfully at the level of the policy changes that voters will support, rather than in people\u2019s choice of what to buy at the supermarket. Many people have a sense that their individual actions don\u2019t matter, but are in favor of passing laws that would constrain their options. In 2018, 63 percent of California voters supported Proposition 12, which required that all products from farmed animals sold in California must come from animals who have sufficient space to turn around and stretch their limbs or wings. (Earlier this month, in a major victory for the animal-welfare movement, the Supreme Court rejected a claim by pork producers that Prop 12 violates the U.S. Constitution.) A similar 2016 initiative in Massachusetts passed by an even more lopsided 78 percent. In both states, most of those voting for change must have been consuming animal products produced under the very conditions they were voting to prohibit.\nWhen it comes to public policy in the United States, however, the role that money and lobbyists play makes changing anything that agribusiness opposes very difficult. It\u2019s telling that, of the 14 U.S. states that have required-minimum-space allowances for farmed animals, all but two provide for ballot initiatives. There is no such federal mechanism. This helps explain why animal-welfare laws are further developed in democracies where money plays a more restricted political role, and where improvements for farmed animals have come through national or (in the case of the EU) transnational legislation.\nPolitical hurdles will be more surmountable if we invest in alternatives to meat that people want and can afford, making it easier for them to align their actions, and votes, with their ethics. The rise of more appealing meat alternatives is a major cause for optimism. Novel plant-based foods that taste and chew like meat help people switch to a more ethical diet, although these products need to get cheaper to compete with meat from animals. Lab-grown meat could be even more revolutionary. Chicken produced from cultured animal cells is already on sale in Singapore. In Israel, the biotech firm Remilk says it can produce \u201creal\u201d dairy products made by copying the gene responsible for milk production in cows and inserting it into yeast cells. The company received regulatory approval in April. But lab-grown products are even further from being affordable and sustainable at scale than plant-based foods are. It\u2019s crucial for investors to support research and development, for regulators to ease products\u2019 path to market, and for governments to encourage their production.\nI was an idealistic young man when Animal Liberation was published. Today I am an idealistic old man. The world has changed since 1975 in ways I couldn\u2019t have imagined, many of them for the worse. But I remain convinced that philosophical arguments can shape how people live their lives. As long as that is true, there is hope for a future in which we will cease to inflict avoidable suffering on any sentient being.\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

      "text": "Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\nMaking America healthy again, it seems, starts with a double cheeseburger and fries. Earlier this month, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited a Steak \u2019n Shake in Florida and shared a meal with Fox News\u2019s Sean Hannity. The setting was no accident: Kennedy has praised the fast-food chain for switching its cooking oil from seed oil, which he falsely claims causes illness, to beef tallow. \u201cPeople are raving about these french fries,\u201d Kennedy said after eating one, before commending other restaurants that fry with beef tallow: Popeyes, Buffalo Wild Wings, Outback Steakhouse.\nTo put it another way, if you order fries at Steak \u2019n Shake, cauliflower wings at Buffalo Wild Wings, or the Bloomin\u2019 Onion at Outback, your food will be cooked in cow fat. For more than a decade, cutting down on meat and other animal products has been idealized as a healthier, more ethical way to eat. Guidelines such as \u201cEat Food. Not Too Much. Mostly Plants\u201d may have disproportionately appealed to liberals in big cities, but the meat backlash has been unavoidable across the United States. The Obama administration passed a law to limit meat in school lunches; more recently, meat alternatives such as Impossible Burger and Beyond Meat have flooded grocery-store shelves, and fast-food giants are even serving them up in burgers and nuggets. It all heralded a future that seemed more tempeh than tomahawk steak: \u201cCould this be the beginning of the end of meat?\u201d wrote The New York Times in 2022.\nNow the goal of eating less meat has lost its appeal. A convergence of cultural and nutritional shifts, supercharged by the return of the noted hamburger-lover President Donald Trump, has thrust meat back to the center of the American plate. It\u2019s not just MAGA bros and MAHA moms who resist plant-based eating. A wide swath of the U.S. seems to be sending a clear message: Nobody should feel bad about eating meat.\nMany people are relieved to hear it. Despite all of the attention on why people should eat less meat\u2014climate change, health, animal welfare\u2014Americans have kept consuming more and more of it. From 2014 to 2024, annual per capita meat consumption rose by nearly 28 pounds, the equivalent of roughly 100 chicken breasts. One way to make sense of this \u201cmeat paradox,\u201d as the ethicist Peter Singer branded it in The Atlantic in 2023, is that there is a misalignment between how people want to eat and the way they actually do. The thought of suffering cows releasing methane bombs into the atmosphere pains me, but I love a medium-rare porterhouse.\nIndeed, lots of people who self-identify as plant-eaters don\u2019t really eat that way, Glynn Tonsor, a professor of agricultural economics at Kansas State University, told me. He runs the national Monthly Meat Demand Monitor, which asks survey respondents to self-declare their diets and then report what they ate the day before. \u201cThe number that tell me they\u2019re vegan or vegetarian\u2014the true number is about half that,\u201d Tonsor said. In some years, the misalignment is even more glaring: In 2023, 7.9 percent of people who filled out the survey self-declared as vegan or vegetarian, but only 1.8 percent actually ate that way consistently. (The survey is partly funded by the meat industry.)\nThat dissonance is a function of how eating less meat has been wrapped in a conscientious and moral sheen. As I wrote last year, labeling items as \u201cplant-based\u201d has become so symbolic of health and goodness that it has been used to sell virtually anything, edible or not. The campaign against meat hasn\u2019t just disappeared, of course. Go to any major grocery store, and you\u2019ll still see plenty of shrink-wrapped Impossible Burgers.\nBut of late, the food landscape is starting to resemble a meatopia. Sweetgreen, a chain that rose to prominence by serving salads that appealed to aspirationally plant-based eaters, now runs ads spotlighting its \u201cprotein plates\u201d piled with steak, chicken, and salmon. Dried meat sticks\u2014think Slim Jims\u2014are the fastest-growing snack category nationwide. Fast-food chains including McDonald\u2019s and Carl\u2019s Jr. have ditched their alternative-meat options.\nThere are a lot of different reasons for this meat renaissance: America has become obsessed with consuming more protein, a fad boosted by the growing numbers of people on GLP-1 drugs seeking out protein-rich diets. Plant-based meat once seemed to be on a path to becoming a dinner staple, but its popularity is in free fall due to concerns about its cost, taste, and healthfulness.\nThe embrace of meat isn\u2019t just about food, but also about what meat represents: tradition, strength, dominance, muscles\u2014values championed by the right. (There\u2019s a reason that \u201csoy boy\u201d is a common pejorative to describe insufficiently masculine liberals.) Conservatives have long sought to turn meat into a front in the culture wars, even suggesting that Democrats \u201cwant to take away your hamburgers.\u201d Last year, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis issued a preemptive ban on the sale of lab-grown meat in his state, describing it as part of \u201cthe global elite\u2019s plan to force the world to eat meat grown in a petri dish, or bugs.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s reelection has bolstered the cause. The rise of meat-eating is part of the larger wave of right-wing influence on American culture. \u201cWoke\u201d\u2014DEI, caring about the climate, eating plant-based\u2014is out. Tradition, at least one specific version of it, is in. Last week, The New Yorker announced the \u201cRevenge of the American Steakhouse,\u201d which, to some, signals a \u201crestoration of the proper order.\u201d Efforts on the right to reestablish conventional gender norms create an environment for gendered eating habits to thrive. Men have long eaten more meat than women; half the nation\u2019s beef is consumed by just 12 percent of the population, most of them men. Research shows that men who subscribe to traditional gender norms tend to eat more beef and chicken.\nSome of the most vocal support for the meat-forward lifestyle emanates from the so-called manosphere, a right-leaning internet subculture best known for men promoting different ways to become manlier. It is popular among the young men who voted for Trump in large numbers. Meat\u2019s ascendance \u201ccoincides with the rise of the masculine influencers,\u201d Timothy Caulfield, a professor at the University of Alberta who studies male health trends, told me. Many of the manosphere\u2019s main characters frame meat-eating as an antidote to the left\u2019s \u201cattack on masculinity,\u201d a recurring right-wing talking point.\nTucker Carlson\u2019s documentary The End of Men calls on men to eat organ meat and raw eggs to boost their testosterone levels. (Little scientific evidence exists to support this.) Last year, Elon Musk appeared on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast and suggested that the climate impacts of industrial meat are overblown: \u201cYou can totally eat as much meat as you want,\u201d he said. Both Musk and Rogan have promoted the all-meat \u201ccarnivore diet.\u201d Other influencers encourage more extreme behaviors, such as eating raw beef testicles for a testosterone boost.\nAll of this is happening amid confusion about what it even means to eat well. The prevailing view among the medical and scientific community has not changed: Reducing consumption of red and processed meats is better for human and planetary health. But as pro-meat figures such as Kennedy and Trump challenge those views\u2014not to mention the institutions that support them\u2014the problems with meat-eating no longer seem as clear-cut.\nPerhaps the decline of plant-based eating was inevitable. Awareness of meat-eating\u2019s many consequences first entered the public consciousness in the late 2000s, after the release of documentaries such as Food, Inc. and books such as The Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma. But the backlash to meat may have taken off for a different reason, Bill Winders, a sociologist of food at Georgia Tech, told me: The Great Recession made meat more expensive. Nearly two decades later, the idea of a meatless future seems quaint. Knowing the reasons you should eat less meat goes only so far. I feel guilty eating steak tartare, but it\u2019s still my favorite dish. The commonality of this experience can feel like a free pass. As Singer, the ethicist, puts it: \u201cMost people can easily continue doing something they believe is wrong as long as they have plenty of company.\u201d Now no one has to keep up the charade."

      "text": "Of the many radical reinventions that have made Eleven Madison Park an object of fascination for food lovers around the world, one of Daniel Humm\u2019s earliest controversies happened just after he started the job. \u201cPeople were revolting,\u201d the 46-year-old remembers with one of those rare, downturned smiles reserved for nostalgia. Though the so-called \u201cFrench fry incident,\u201d like many of the others, was certainly not as funny at the time.\nThe restaurant originally opened in 1998 as a classic New York brasserie in the former storage space of the art deco Metropolitan Life North Building on the southwest edge of Madison Square Park. When owner Danny Meyer, the hospitality mogul responsible for the likes of Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern, and Shake Shack, poached Humm from San Francisco\u2019s Campton Place a near-decade later, the young Swiss chef had a different direction for Eleven Madison Park in mind\u2014and a new menu to boot. Eighty-sixing the fries, which were crisped so much they left a painterly trail of oil across their paper cone container, was Humm\u2019s first executive decision. \u201cPeople sent letters to Danny saying, \u2018This restaurant is going to close, you\u2019ll never make it,\u2019\u2019 he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t actually want to get rid of them, but there was no room for French fries for where I wanted to go.\u201d\nA quarter of a century later, Humm has finally gotten there. Seated on a velvety French blue banquette in the lavish dining room of the Eleven Madison Park he always knew it could be\u2014the restaurant he joined as chef de cuisine in 2006, that he purchased from his boss-slash-mentor in 2011 with Will Guidara, the business partner whom, to much surprise, he then bought out eight years later\u2014today he is happy, proud even, if he lets himself admit it.\nHumm spent the first two decades of his life training to become a pro cyclist, and still maintains the rigor of an athlete striving for perfection, of which he\u2019s come near-close. Now the sole proprietor of the restaurant, Humm is more than just a chef who moved from the line to the back office. He is the lifeblood of the Eleven Madison Park brand, and his progressive menu has set the standard for American fine dining again and again: first as a choose-your-own-adventure style pre-fixe with an inventive take on haute cuisine\u2014his honey lavender duck has become a topic of fierce debate among imitators on Reddit, as has his pig bladders-braised celery root\u2014and now, notably, as entirely plant-based. All this has earned Humm 11 James Beard Foundation Awards, three Michelin stars, the coveted top spot on The World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants, and more\u2014plus loyal patronage from the likes of Billie Eilish, Angelina Jolie, and Gabriela Hearst. The chef has also launched Eleven Madison Home, co-founded the food equity non-profit Rethink Food with his former Chef de Partie Matt Jozwiak, and authored a handful of books.\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent more hours in this place than anywhere else over my entire lifetime,\u201d says Humm, nodding to an artwork on a chalkboard that the Hungarian painter Rita Ackermann made for the restaurant\u2019s largest renovation in 2017, one of the restaurateur\u2019s many chapters of reinvention. It\u2019s surrounded by other site-specific commissions by artists like Daniel Turner, Rashid Johnson, and Olympia Scarry. \u201cThey\u2019re all very personal,\u201d says Humm. \u201cSome of them are challenging, even. The overall idea was about changing direction\u2014about respecting the past in order to go forward. It\u2019s about erasing, creating.\u201d As Eleven Madison Park hits its 25th anniversary this fall, the sentiment could not be more true.\nTo mark the milestone of the brand that has become an extension of himself, the chef is celebrating as he knows best: in a multitude of ways. First up is Eat More Plants, a new book with German publisher Steidl. Unlike Humm\u2019s past tomes, which opened up his professional kitchens to the general public, this coffee-table book peers into his soul.\nThe 184-page release features vibrant paintings, delectable drawings, and reflective annotations taken directly from the personal journals Humm made during the pandemic, when he converted Eleven Madison Park into a commissary kitchen to produce over 3,000 meals per day for New Yorkers in need. \u201cWhat is luxury in food today? It is our privilege and responsibility to see these answers,\u201d Humm writes in the book, meditating on food equity and the industry\u2019s impact on the planet. \u201cWe reached the summit when we became the best restaurant in the world, I felt in truth that there is something more.\u201d\nThe pages of the new book document Eleven Madison Park\u2019s transition to meatlessness, and the ethics that Humm holds dear\u2014a journey that foodies will be able to taste firsthand in a special edition anniversary tasting menu, launching October 3. Representing the restaurant\u2019s past, present, and future, the six-course menu will be available at Eleven Madison Park for six weeks, with the first booking reservations going live next week. The actual experience begins like many others do at Eleven Madison Park: with a savory black and white cookie. It\u2019s a nod to the restaurant\u2019s New York roots, only unlike the original apple and cheddar dish that Humm once served, guests will enjoy a surprise new interpretation. They\u2019ll also dine on revisited classics from the past 25 years, including carrot tartare (\u201ca plant dish we had before we knew were plant-based,\u201d says Humm), avocado tonburi vegan caviar, and other menu favorites. To top it off, the restaurateur will add three meals for every anniversary month diner to its 1,000-plus monthly meal donation to Rethink Food.\n\u201cVegetables are not scary,\u201d adds Humm, who has been outspoken about the fact our current food system is unsustainable, even speaking about its environmental effects at the United Nations Climate Change and the Global Citizen Summit. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to have an open mind and to challenge ourselves\u2014to change traditions\u2014because many of them don\u2019t make sense anymore. I think if we can all be a bit more open, we\u2019ll realize how beautiful and delicious life can be.\u201d"

      "text": "Eleven Madison Park\nNew York\n- Voted The World\u2019s Best Restaurant in 2017\n- Won the inaugural Art of Hospitality Award in 2016\n- Daniel Humm won the Chefs\u2019 Choice Award in 2015\nEleven might just have been the lucky number for Will Guidara and Daniel Humm. Five years into their running of Eleven Madison Park, in 2011 they bought it from Union Square Hospitality, the group owned by restaurateur Danny Meyer, who had introduced them in 2006. Eleven years after their first meeting, the restaurant was finally crowned No.1 in The World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants in 2017. That same year, Humm and Guidara signed a new lease at 11 Madison Square, celebrating with an 11-course menu of chef Humm\u2019s greatest hits before closing the restaurant for an extensive revamp.\nBut Eleven Madison Park\u2019s success had nothing to do with luck and everything to do with the marriage of equals between kitchen and dining room, Humm and Guidara. A partnership like theirs was a rare thing in the restaurant world, with their respective domains given the same weight and prominence in status and decision making. Humm would never serve a dish that Guidara didn\u2019t like, and their trademark approach of delighting diners with bespoke surprises was a joint effort. Everything adhered to the duo\u2019s favourite saying and overarching company name: \u2018Make it Nice\u2019. In July 2019, Eleven Madison Park entered a new era when Humm took sole ownership of the restaurant and started steering it into new directions.\nWhile Swiss-born perfectionist Humm is classically trained, he dedicated the years 2017-2019 to paring things back. The restaurant made its name with his neoclassical style and iconic creations like roasted duck with honey and lavender, or the playful black and white cookies that symbolise New York. Guidara\u2019s slick operation of the Art Deco dining room centred around tableside theatrics like removing the neck of a port bottle with scorching hot tongs, or delivering an off-menu treat based on an overheard conversation.\nIn 2016, the pair scaled back the quantity of tableside interactions and cut the tasting menu down to just eight to 10 courses because they wanted every dish to be memorable. Humm says he \u201cfound himself as a chef\u201d when he perfected a dish of just two ingredients: his signature celery root with black truffle, cooked in a pig\u2019s bladder. Post-renovation, the dining room is cleaner and the menu more minimalist than ever, but the restaurant has lost none of its classic appeal.\nThe surprises didn't end there: in June 2021, when Humm reopened the restaurant after 15 months of closure, he did so with an entirely plant-based menu. Daring in its concept, flavours and philosophy, this timeless New York restaurant looks set to be a favourite forever.\nRead the interview with Daniel Humm on a new definition of luxury and what\u2019s next for Eleven Madison Park"

      "text": "An Update on Our Menu\nWhen we reopened Eleven Madison Park in 2021, emerging from lockdown, we vowed to rebuild differently: craft a meal every bit as transporting as before without a single animal product. The decision was a creative leap and a climate imperative.\nPost-pandemic, it seemed like EMP was destined for a new milestone. Change is fundamental to who we are and how we grow. In this respect, we have to change to stay the same.\nThis change, though, felt different. The announcement ignited a debate that transcended food, something we hadn\u2019t prepared for. This na\u00efvet\u00e9 proved to be an asset, and without it, I may not have had the courage to forge this path.\nMy team and I felt liberated and cracked open. The journey proved richer than any before.\nWe created a new culinary language: mille-feuille without butter, meringue without eggs, almond-milk ricotta, sunflower butter, koji stocks, whipped cashew cream, even \u201cland caviar.\u201d We drew inspiration from food cultures we had previously overlooked. We furthered our pursuit of vegetables and launched our own \u2018Magic Farms\u2019 upstate.\nIn 2022 Eleven Madison Park became the first restaurant in the world to earn three Michelin stars for an entirely plant-based menu. Michelin wrote the rulebook of luxury dining, and to be decorated by the very guardians of tradition was something unimaginable. It felt like walking on water.\nOver the last five years, with each season and new menu that we\u2019ve been serving, we\u2019ve also been intently listening to our guests' feedback.\nIt became clear that while we had built something meaningful, we had also unintentionally kept people out. This is the opposite of what we believe hospitality to be.\nThe all-or-nothing approach was necessary to develop our expertise, but that too, comes with its own limitations. As a chef I want to continue to open paths, not close them.\nAs I approach my 20th anniversary at EMP, I\u2019ve decided it\u2019s time for change again.\nStarting October 14th, we will integrate our new language into a menu that embraces choice. We will offer a plant-based menu, of course, but also select animal products for certain dishes \u2014 fish, meat, and yes, our honey-lavender-glazed duck.\nEating together is the essence of who we are, and I\u2019ve learned that for me to truly champion plant-based cooking, I need to create an environment where everyone feels welcome around the table.\nI\u2019m deeply grateful to our team and guests for supporting this journey. It\u2019s you who allow us to grow.\n\u2013 Daniel\nReservations for the fall season open September 1, and our new menu debuts October 14. Learn more on our FAQ page."

      "text": "YES, CHEF\nChef Daniel Humm Is Begging You to Eat More Plants\n\u201cIn this five or six-year period that I\u2019ve known you,\u201d Gabriela Hearst says of her friend, the chef Daniel Humm, \u201cI\u2019ve seen you go from number one in the world, to bankruptcy, to starting a soup kitchen, to going plant-based, to being criticized for being plant-based, to three Michelin star plant-based.\u201d Stretch back ever farther, to the year 1998, when Humm first opened the fine dining mecca Eleven Madison Park, and his journey from endurance athlete to visionary gourmand seems even more improbable, and impressive. Last month, Humm celebrated the 25-year anniversary of EMP, which eliminated all animal products in 2021, with the release of Eat More Plants: A Chef\u2019s Journal, a collection of drawings, memoranda, and random notations that functions as a rare peak inside Humm\u2019s perpetually enterprising and adaptable mind. To honor the occasion, he got on Zoom with Hearst to talk about Miles Davis, running marathons, and taking the path less followed.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\nGABRIELA HEARST: Hola! I\u2019m so excited to be doing this because two days ago you complained that your texts were not being responded to fast enough.\nDANIEL HUMM: I know, it\u2019s like I\u2019m having a monologue. But today we\u2019ll have a dialogue.\nHEARST: Today\u2019s going to be a dialogue because you are one of the three human beings that I admire the most, and probably number one. I always feel honored to not only be your friend, but to celebrate your career and how much you\u2019ve transformed yourself as a creative. Looking back, would you have expected this transformation?\nHUMM: Firstly, thank you for all the sweet words. I think we bonded because we see the world and our work in a similar way and we want to push the envelope in the luxury field. When we first met, I was still trying to reach this mountaintop that I set out 20 years before, which was to have the best restaurant in the world. It was a mountaintop of chasing accolades that was definitely motivated by my ego and my team\u2019s ego. I\u2019m not saying ego is a bad thing, but it was too much of a force. You know this, but when I was in my early twenties, I was on the path to be a professional cyclist when I had a bad accident that put everything at a halt, and I really only had one other passion, which was cooking. So I took this athlete\u2019s mentality towards my career. I wanted to be the best, I wanted to win every award. I always understood intellectually that none of these awards are that meaningful on their own, but it did make the restaurant better. In 2017, after we met, we became the best restaurant in the world. It was really disorienting because at that point there was not a single award left. I was only 40 years old and had achieved everything I ever dreamed of, which created a lot of problems because it was unclear where we were going next. We talked every day for 20 years about reaching that summit, and we never spoke about what we would do once we reached it. I knew that there had to be higher meaning, and it took me a while to figure it out, but I co-founded an organization called Rethink Food, where we take food from restaurants to prepare meals for people in need.\nHEARST: During COVID?\nHUMM: COVID hit and our restaurant just fell apart overnight. There are no Eleven Madison Park tables on the sidewalk. It\u2019s just not that kind of business. We literally had no business at all for two straight years and we faced bankruptcy. But 25% of New York City was food insecure and I felt I had this responsibility. So even through extreme financial challenges, I started feeling so happy about the work. I got up in the morning and I was like, \u201cWow, this really matters.\u201d The two-dollar meals in cardboard boxes really made a difference in people\u2019s lives. So when it was time to reopen the restaurant, I felt the responsibility to use my and my team\u2019s creativity towards plant-based eating. From a creative place, the world does not need another dry-aged ribeye or butter-poached lobster. The creativity needs to go towards plant-based eating, because we\u2019re moving there.\nHEARST: As you were talking, I was thinking that in this five or six-year period that I\u2019ve known you, I\u2019ve seen you go from number one in the world, to bankruptcy, to starting a soup kitchen, to going plant-based, to being criticized for being plant-based, to three Michelin star plant-based. Nobody\u2019s been there. I told you to stop running marathons because you\u2019re ruining your legs, and [I told you] not to go plant-based because you\u2019re going bankrupt\u2014\nHUMM: I take your advice on how to dress.\nHEARST: But you also lowered your marathon time to less than three hours. I am your witness. I\u2019ve seen the [David] Beckham documentary and I\u2019m like, \u201cThey have nothing on Daniel Humm. The guy is like Mr. Comeback.\u201d People think success is linear, but success is ups and downs, circling around, and you have done what the most admirable creatives and thinkers always do, which is retreat from the system.\nHUMM: It took me a long time to find myself. When we reopened the restaurant, at first everyone came, and then we eventually got criticized, mostly by people who never came. And being criticized is really challenging no matter how confident one is. It makes you and your team doubt, and then you have to check yourself. But I was not prepared. I just thought from a creative place. Sometimes people say, \u201cThat was such a genius idea to go plant-based.\u201d Honestly, it\u2019s not genius at all. It\u2019s obvious. If one pays attention to the world while working in food, there is only one place to go, and that\u2019s cooking plant-based. I\u2019m not an expert in climate or food systems or farming, but I\u2019m an expert in what ingredients come to my kitchen. The first thing I was taught as a chef was to always start with the best possible ingredients, and all the animal products are no longer superior products. If my job is to bring the best ingredients to my guests, I can no longer serve meat or fish because those ingredients are from factory farming. The chickens have bird flu. The fish is full of plastic. The beef is filled with antibiotics. The Amazon is burning. There\u2019s only one place to go as a creative. But I wasn\u2019t prepared to be this much of an outsider, and it has had its challenges.\nHEARST: There\u2019s a line from Don Quixote that translates to, \u201cThey\u2019re barking, Sancho. It\u2019s a sign that we\u2019re moving forward.\u201d It\u2019s about being an outlier in thinking. And I agree that sometimes common sense can be perceived as genius, but seeing something so obvious to one but blind to most is really where the genius lies. You may have been the first to do it, but others will follow. And that\u2019s the bigger mission in the poetry of your food. I eat it season by season and you can see how your symphony is just getting better and better. Even being the top restaurant in the world, you\u2019re still honing.\nHUMM: I think we need to really change dramatically, and it\u2019s so true in your world. What materials are we using, and what is the new luxury? It\u2019s inspiring to talk to you because I think what we do is so similar. We work with raw materials. We are on a seasonal schedule. You have your shows coming up, and they cannot wait. What we do is like creating four collections a year. There is a message, there is beauty, there is the quality of ingredients, there is craft, there is art, there is leadership, there is storytelling. Sometimes the world isn\u2019t so open to people pushing boundaries. Honestly, it shocks me that I had the courage to take this risk. I think it\u2019s because during the pandemic, I didn\u2019t have too many people around me to talk me out of it.\nHEARST: I tried.\nHUMM: Yeah. And as we got closer to reopening, worries did come. I\u2019m bringing back a team of 250 people, and everyone is relying on a job. This is not just an artistic endeavor; it\u2019s our livelihood. No matter how important the idea is, if we don\u2019t succeed commercially, our whole endeavor will not matter. Early on, one of the criticisms we got was because we had a private dining room where we sat people who made reservations and paid deposits before COVID. So when we reopened as a fully plant-based restaurant, we decided to honor the reservations that had been booked before the pandemic.\nHEARST: And that was the \u201csecret meat room\u201d?\nHUMM: Exactly. We got attacked by people saying, \u201cAt Eleven Madison Park, somewhere hidden upstairs there is a private meat room for the rich.\u201d\nHEARST: Another thing that I think people don\u2019t get right is the human intelligence that goes into formulating. It\u2019s really like lab work, how many chefs and clever heads are working around creating a vegetable dish. Maybe people think this is just eggplant, but there is a journey of that eggplant that has been treated and experimented with and tested for so long. As you just pointed out, if this doesn\u2019t work as a business, if it\u2019s not delicious, there\u2019s no point in putting it out there. So it has to not only taste incredible, but it\u2019s Daniel Humm, so it has to look like a painting. People say, \u201cWhy are you charging so much for an eggplant?\u201d But it\u2019s a really thought-through eggplant, and it\u2019s a really special sensorial experience that you\u2019ve probably never had before. I\u2019ve tasted flavors I\u2019ve never tasted before in your restaurant. At the end of the day, just like in my industry, the product will talk. That\u2019s why you\u2019re still dancing.\nHUMM: And we do this night after night, and that speaks louder than any criticism. Maybe it\u2019s because I was an endurance athlete, but I will endure any criticism and still be there in the end.\nHEARST: And with Eat More Plants, I get to see the little boy. I get to see the creativity and the curiosity and the honesty and the childlike heart in the drawings. Do you want to tell me more about the book?\nHUMM: Thank you, and I feel that way about you too. You\u2019re such an inspiration in your drive and your research, but there\u2019s another side of you: your curiosity. You\u2019re constantly bringing new things into my world. It could be music or anything else. And if you look at my journal, it looks like a child did it. My journals haven\u2019t really evolved. They look just as they did when I was 15 years old.\nHEARST: That\u2019s what Picasso tried to do all his career.\nHUMM: I have tried to foster that. Eat More Plants was never supposed to be a book, but it was my journal during the pandemic when my idea about plant-based eating and cooking came to life. I got to work with Gerhard Steidl from Steidl Publishing, who has published some of the greatest art books there are. It\u2019s been a very personal project, and it feels vulnerable to have these drawings out there because when I was sitting there often in the middle of the night drawing them, never in a million years did I think anyone would ever see these pages.\nHEARST: I want to talk about that because I don\u2019t know if people are aware how much art means to you.\nHUMM: When I was 10 years old, my parents took me to the l\u2019Orangerie in Paris to see Monet\u2019s water lilies. I felt so strongly that I cried. I didn\u2019t know if I was happy or if I was sad, but I was so moved that I knew I wanted to pay attention to this energy. It\u2019s like the sunrise affecting you or the waves when you\u2019re in the ocean. And for me, painting or artistic expression deeply affects me. And then I became a student of it. Even today, I would say I probably know more about art than even cooking. It\u2019s something that fills my heart and my soul. During the pandemic, I was interested in the moments in art where things are shifting, like the beginning of abstract painting, which is only about a hundred years old. And that feeling that I could be the first to do something gave me an energy that was crucial.\nHEARST: Who\u2019s the artist you used to quote?\nHUMM: Willem de Kooning. He said, \u201cI have to change to stay the same.\u201d\nHEARST: Which is a bit like Miles Davis\u2019 philosophy. He\u2019d rather suck than stay the same.\nHUMM: Miles also has a great quote that I love, \u201cDon\u2019t play what\u2019s there. Play what\u2019s not.\u201d Miles has been a huge inspiration for me. Our first review was in the New York Observer by Moira Hodgson. It was actually a positive review, almost too positive. But one line was, \u201cI wish this place would have a little bit more Miles Davis.\u201d And we were like, \u201cWow, that\u2019s cool, but what the hell does that mean?\u201d So I started researching Miles and the more I learned, the more fascinated I became with his genius. With each album, he created a new genre in jazz. We created a list of 11 words that were most commonly used to describe him: cool, endless reinvention, forward-moving, collaborative, innovative, and so forth. So Miles has been hugely influential. There is a guy who\u2019s credited with creating the internet, and he came to the restaurant and told me the story that when the internet first came out, the New York Times wrote, \u201cThe internet will be no more than a fax machine.\u201d Some big ideas often get criticized early on because people are afraid of change and what it will mean to their lives. So when I cook plant-based and it\u2019s being celebrated, it\u2019s like, \u201cOh my god, now I have to cook plant-based?\u201d\nHEARST: Right.\nHUMM: Another thing is that we were a restaurant that was famous for duck and lobster and foie gras, so going plant-based meant we couldn\u2019t use any of these dishes. There was a fear of leaving all this knowledge behind, but also of limitation. But as we have stepped more and more into this space, we realized that we were limited before. When I think about the meals we served before, it was like every fine dining restaurant. You get a bit of cold fish and then a bit of warm fish and then maybe a little lobster, and then you get some meat and a dessert. Okay, fine.\nHEARST: You get the Wagyu.\nHUMM: Every restaurant does that. It was almost like we just cooked seasonal condiments for meat and fish. But now we\u2019re really cooking from the ground up. We\u2019re much more inspired by the entire world. I feel like I\u2019m at the very beginning of my career.\nHEARST: If Leonardo DaVinci were alive, he would be eating at Eleven Madison Park because he didn\u2019t eat animals.\nHUMM: Exactly.\nHEARST: And he would be wearing a pink tunic. He had curly long hair. He would fit in."

      "text": "Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\nA not-insignificant number of TikToks aim to convince the viewer that beef-tallow moisturizer will not make your face smell like cow. The beauty influencers who tend to appear in these videos\u2014usually clear-skinned women rubbing tallow into their face as they detail their previous dermatological woes\u2014describe the scent as \u201cbuttery\u201d or \u201cearthy\u201d or grass-like. Many of them come to the same conclusion: Okay, even if the tallow does smell a little bit, the smooth skin it leaves behind is well worth it.\nBeef tallow (as both a moisturizer and an alternative to seed oils) is one of many cow-based products that have crowded the wellness market in the past five or so years. Beef-bone broth is a grocery-store staple. Demand for raw milk has grown, despite numerous cases of illness and warnings from public-health officials that drinking it can be fatal. In certain circles, raw cow organs\u2014heart, liver, kidney\u2014are prized superfoods. Target and Walmart sell supplements containing bovine collagen (a protein found in cowhide and bone) and colostrum (the rich liquid that mammals produce for their newborn offspring); they promise healthier skin, a happier gut, and stronger immunity, and come in flavors such as watermelon lime, lemon sorbet, and \u201cvaliant grape.\u201d You can buy cow-placenta pills for postpartum healing, or powdered bull testicle for testosterone support. The slightest interaction with clean-beauty Instagram can fill your feed with ads for beef-tallow lip balms, cleansing creams, sunscreen, and deodorants. (One brand even offers creamsicle-flavored beef-tallow personal lubricant, which is currently out of stock online.) Influencers praise tallow for clearing their acne and eczema\u2014and offer discount codes so you can experience the same.\nEven the government\u2019s recent public-health messaging has veered toward the bovine. During his tenure as health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has championed cooking in beef tallow (which he says is healthier than seed oils) and drinking raw milk (one of many items that he claims are suppressed by the FDA). Casey Means, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for surgeon general, also supports raw milk; she has suggested that Americans can decide whether a given bottle is safe to drink by looking the dairy farmer in the eye and petting his cow. Means and Kennedy have largely avoided engaging with the many public-health experts who reject their views. But in May, after months of such critiques, Kennedy took shots of raw milk at the White House to celebrate the release of the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d report.\nWoo-woo, it seems, is becoming moo-moo. America has entered its cowmaxxing era.\nLike most wellness offerings, cow products are marketed with vague health claims that are virtually impossible to confirm or deny, such as \u201cdeeply nourishes and supports the skin barrier,\u201d \u201cactivate cellular health,\u201d and \u201csupports memory.\u201d One of the many promises of the Ancestral Supplements Starter Pack of organ-based capsules is simply \u201cvitality.\u201d (The company also includes a disclaimer that the FDA has not reviewed said vitality benefits.) Advocates of these goods tend to be more specific in their praise. Raw-milk enthusiasts claim that unpasteurized milk contains bioactive chemicals that improve human health. In one video, a woman drinks raw milk that\u2019s been in the fridge for more than a month; she claims it is safer to consume than store-bought pizza or salad and that it reduces rates of eczema, fevers, and respiratory infections. One smooth-skinned influencer, who says she hasn\u2019t washed her face in two years, claims that beef tallow is \u201cbioidentical\u201d to the sebum produced by human skin. (It\u2019s not, because it\u2019s from cows.)\nSome of these products are more likely to provide benefits than others. Bone broth is indeed rich in collagen (which, when produced by the human body, strengthens hair and skin). Whey powder, made from leftover cheese water, does contain protein. But very few studies support the idea that eating more collagen strengthens hair and skin. Whey protein can help build lean muscle, but the body can only absorb so much at a time. Some dermatologists say tallow can strengthen and hydrate the skin; others say it clogs pores and should be avoided. Other products can be downright dangerous: Just this week, Florida officials announced that 21 people fell sick after consuming contaminated raw milk.\nAt least part of the appeal of cowmaxxing is the cows themselves: The products evoke the pastoral ideal of a cow grazing freely in the plains, milked lovingly by human hands. It\u2019s an image that\u2019s been embedded in American culture for centuries. Consider how Laura Ingalls Wilder, who was no stranger to the harsh reality of farm life, described cow-raising in Little Town on the Prairie: \u201cWarm and sweet, the scent of new milk came up from the streams hissing into the rising foam, and it mixed with the scents of springtime.\u201d It\u2019s enough to persuade a microbiologist to drink raw milk.\nIn 21st-century America, cows still summon images of fields and clover and wide blue sky, enough to trigger the human tendency to believe that what\u2019s natural is \u201cfundamentally good,\u201d Courtney Lappas, a biology professor at Lebanon Valley College, told me. Her research has shown that some Americans prefer natural over man-made products even when the former is described as objectively worse\u2014a phenomenon her colleague Brian Meier has called the \u201cnaturalness bias.\u201d This tendency, which is prevalent across cultures, likely leads people to assume that unprocessed cow-based products are safe and healthy, she said. Tallow, some skin-care enthusiasts claim, is a healthier, safer alternative to conventional moisturizers, which supposedly contain toxic chemicals. The branding of such products, too, leans into the notion that natural is best: Fat Cow Skincare markets its tallow cosmetics as \u201cpure skincare, powered by nature\u201d; Heart and Soil sells capsules of \u201cnature\u2019s superfood\u201d (that is, organ meats). Other brands invoke nature through the prehistoric, with names such as Primal Harvest, Primal Kitchen, Primal FX, Primal Being, and Primal Queen. Ancestral Supplements\u2019 ad copy reads: \u201cPutting Back In What the Modern World Left Out.\u201d\nAmerica\u2019s current health landscape is the perfect setting for cowmaxxing to thrive. The naturalness bias is deeply ingrained in Kennedy\u2019s MAHA campaign, which aims to improve public health by returning to a more natural lifestyle. In Kennedy\u2019s view, beef tallow is superior to seed oil because it\u2019s less processed (some people even render it at home). The carnivore and tradwife movements embody a similar message, promoting the consumption of raw cow organs and making butter from scratch. You may not know what\u2019s in store-bought products, the thinking goes, but you do know what\u2019s in tallow: pure, unadulterated cow fat.\nAnd yet most modern cows live in a decidedly unnatural environment. The majority of U.S. cattle are fed genetically modified crops, and some genetically modified cows are allowed to be sold as food. Many cow-based wellness products bear the label \u201cgrass-fed,\u201d which suggests cows that were raised on pastures rather than feedlots. But the label is not strictly enforced, and it doesn\u2019t necessarily prohibit farmers from giving cows antibiotics or hormones. There\u2019s no guarantee that a cow whose colostrum is harvested to be sold by a tradwife on Instagram had a happy, bucolic existence. Not to mention that colostrum, whey, and placenta do not come out of the cow in the form of powders or pills.\nThe spread of science misinformation, along with legitimate concerns about the state of public health in the United States, has left many Americans understandably confused about whether conventional science and Western medicine can be trusted in 2025. Getting to the bottom of, say, the seed-oil controversy requires engaging with thorny scientific debates that reference inscrutable research papers; embracing the natural and ancestral by opting for tallow is an attractively simple-seeming alternative. \u201cIt brings with it a sense of purity or wholesomeness that is desirable right now,\u201d Marianne Clark, a sociologist at Acadia University who studies wellness trends, told me. In this sense, cowmaxxing is not so much a health endeavor as it is a spiritual one, its promise downright biblical: Cowliness is next to godliness."

      "text": "Everything Can Be Meat\nThe most promising future of lab-grown meat may not look like meat at all.\nListen to more stories on the Noa app.\nRecently, a photo of rice left me confused. The rice itself looked tasty enough\u2014fluffy, well formed\u2014but its oddly fleshy hue gave me the creeps. According to the scientists who\u2019d developed it, each pink-tinged grain was seeded with muscle and fat cells from a cow, imparting a nutty, umami flavor.\nIn one sense, this \u201cbeef rice\u201d was just another example of lab-grown meat, touted as a way to eat animals without the ethical and environmental impacts. Though not yet commercially available, the rice was developed by researchers in Korea as a nutrition-dense food that can be produced sustainably, at least more so than beef itself. Although it has a more brittle texture than normal rice, it can be cooked and served in the same way. Yet in another sense, this rice was entirely different. Lab-grown meat aims to replicate conventional meat in every dimension, including taste, nutrition, and appearance. Beef rice doesn\u2019t even try.\nMaybe that\u2019s a good thing. Lab-grown meat, also widely known as cultivated meat, has long been heralded as the future of food. But so far, the goal of perfectly replicating meat as we know it\u2014toothy, sinewy, and sometimes bloody\u2014has proved impractical and expensive. Once-abundant funding has dried up, and this week, Florida moved toward becoming the first state to ban sales of cultivated meat. It seems unlikely that whole cuts of cultivated meat will be showing up on people\u2019s plates anytime soon\u2014but maybe something like beef rice could. The most promising future of lab-grown meat may not look like meat at all, at least as we\u2019ve always known it.\nThe promise of cultivated meat is that you can have your steak and eat it too. Unlike the meatless offerings at your grocery store, cultivated meat is meat\u2014just created without killing any animals. But the science just isn\u2019t there yet. Companies have more or less figured out the first step, taking a sample of cells from a live animal or egg and propagating them in a tank filled with a nutrient-rich broth. Though not cheaply: By one estimate, creating a slurry of cultivated cells costs $17 a pound or more to produce.\nThe next step has proved prohibitively challenging: coaxing that sludge of cells to mature into different types\u2014fat, muscle, connective tissue\u2014and arranging them in a structure resembling a solid cut of meat. Usually, the cells need a three-dimensional platform to guide their growth, known as a scaffold. \u201cIt\u2019s something that is very easy to get wrong and hard to get right,\u201d Claire Bomkamp, a senior scientist at the Good Food Institute, a nonprofit supporting meat alternatives, told me. So far, a few companies have served up proofs of concept: In June, the United States approved the sale of cultivated chicken from Upside Foods and Good Meat. However, it is virtually impossible to come by now.\nThe basic science of lab-grown meat can be used for more than just succulent chicken breasts and medium-rare steaks. Cells grown in a tank function essentially like ground meat, imparting a meaty flavor and mouthfeel to whatever they are added to, behaving more like an ingredient or a seasoning than a food product. Hybrid meat products, made by mixing a small amount of cultivated-meat cells with other ingredients, are promising because they would be more cost-effective than entire lab-grown steaks or chicken breasts but meatier than purely plant-based meat.\nAlready, the start-up SciFi Foods is producing what has been described as a \u201cfatty meat paste\u201d that is intended to be mixed with plant-based ingredients to make burgers. Only small amounts are needed to make the burgers beefy; each costs less than $10 to make, according to the company\u2014still considerably more than a normal beef patty, but the prices should come down over time. Maybe it sounds weird, but that\u2019s not so different from imitation crab\u2014which doesn\u2019t contain much or any crab at all. A similar premise underlies the plant-based bacon laced with cultivated pork fat that I tried last year. Was it meat? I\u2019m not sure. Did it taste like it? Absolutely.\nMeat can be so much more than what we\u2019ve always known. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to make meat the same way that it\u2019s always come out of an animal,\u201d Bomkamp said. \u201cWe can be a little bit more expansive in what our definition of meat is.\u201d Beef rice, which essentially uses rice as a miniature scaffold to grow cow cells, falls into this category. It isn\u2019t particularly meaty\u2014only 0.5 percent of each grain is cow\u2014but the scientists who developed it say the proportion could change in future iterations. It\u2019s framed as a way to feed people in \u201cunderdeveloped countries, during war, and in space.\u201d\nEventually, cultivated meat could impart a whiff of meatiness to blander foods, creating new, meat-ish products in the process that are more sustainable than regular meat and more nutritious than plants. Beef rice is one option; meat grown on mushroom roots is in development. Even stranger foods are possible. Bomkamp envisions using the technology to make thin sheets of seafood\u2014combining elements of salmon, tuna, and shrimp\u2014to wrap around a rainbow roll of sushi. In this scenario, cultivated meat probably won\u2019t save the planet from climate change and animal suffering. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t serve its original function of being a direct replacement for commercial meat,\u201d Daniel Rosenfeld, who studies perceptions of cultivated meat at UCLA, told me. But at the very least, it could provide another dinner option.\nOf course, it\u2019s in the interest of the cultivated-meat industry to suggest that cultivated meat isn\u2019t just outright doomed. No doubt some vegetarians would cringe at the thought, as would some dedicated carnivores. But considering how much meat Americans eat, it\u2019s not hard to imagine a future in which cultivated cells satisfy people searching for a new kind of meat product. Imagine the salad you could make with chicken cells grown inside arugula, or bread baked with bacon-infused wheat. But should those prove too difficult to produce, I\u2019d happily take a bowl of beef rice, in all its flesh-tinged glory."

However, after four years, he announced a return to serving select animal products, citing a need for inclusivity and declining interest from diners. This shift reflects a broader trend in the U.S. where, despite rising vegetarianism, meat consumption continues to increase, highlighting the complexities of dietary choices amid ethical and environmental concerns.",
