  "description": "Swift is the guest on a special edition of her boyfriend Travis Kelce's podcast this week. Here's what to know ahead of the episode.",
  "content": "\u2022 Taylor Swift will be a guest on the \"New Heights\" podcast hosted by Travis and Jason Kelce.\n\u2022 The episode will air on Wednesday, August 13 at 7 p.m. ET.\n\u2022 This is Swift's first appearance on the podcast, though she has been a topic of conversation previously.\n\nOne of the most popular podcasts in sports will have a special guest this week.\n\nKansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and his brother, Jason, will welcome Taylor Swift to their \"New Heights\" podcast. Swift and Travis started dating two years ago and have become the NFL's most popular celebrity couple. For the first time in their relationship, Swift will appear on the show.\n\n\"New Heights\" teased a surprise show this week with a new guest. Many speculated that it would be Swift and the show confirmed those rumors with a clip from the upcoming episode.\n\nIf Swifties needed another reason to tune in, they got one. At 12:12 a.m. ET on Aug. 12, the show posted a clip from the upcoming episode in which Swift shows her new album \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"\n\nThat's more than enough reason to tune in this week. Here's everything to know ahead of Swift's appearance on \"New Heights\" this week:\n\nNew Heights podcast, Taylor Swift live updates: What to know\n\nWhen does the New Heights Taylor Swift episode come out?\n\nThe special \"New Heights\" podcast episode with Taylor Swift releases Wednesday, Aug. 13 at 7 p.m. ET.\n\nWhere to watch the New Heights podcast\n\nYou can catch the \"New Heights\" in both podcast and video format. It's the top show on Apple Music and also available on Spotify. In video form, it's available on YouTube.\n\nWill Taylor Swift announce her new album on the podcast?\n\nYes, a clip from the upcoming episode shows Swift unveiling her new album \"The Life of a Showgirl.\" It's her 12th studio album and the second in as many years after 2024's \"The Tortured Poets Department.\"\n\nHas Taylor Swift been on Travis Kelce's podcast before?\n\nNo, this is the artist's first appearance on the show but she's been mentioned many times over the last two years.\n\nTravis first talked about going to one of her concerts on an episode in July 2023.\n\n\"I was disappointed that she doesn't talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs she sings so I was a little butthurt I didn't get to hand her one of the bracelets I made her,\" Travis said. \"If you're up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are friendship bracelets and I had received a bunch of them, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it.\"\n\nTwo months later, the two were officially dating.\n\nWhat is the New Heights podcast?\n\nThe show premiered on Sept. 7, 2022 when both brothers were active players in the NFL. Jason was entering his 12th and penultimate season with the Philadelphia Eagles as their starting center. He retired following the 2023 NFL season after earning his sixth career first-team All-Pro honor.\n\nJason's career with the Eagles and Travis' with the Chiefs means prominent people from both franchises have appeared on the show. Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts, general manager Howie Roseman, coach Nick Sirianni and running back Saquon Barkley have all appeared at least once on the podcast. Same goes for Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, defensive tackle Chris Jones and coach Andy Reid.\n\nThe podcast grew in popularity enough over the following two years that Wondery, Amazon's podcast platform, paid more than $100 million for the ad sales and distribution rights for the show.\n\nSwift is one of the highest-profile guests the brothers have had on the show but she's not alone. Here are some of the more notable non-football guests to appear on \"New Heights\":",

      "text": "Travis, Jason Kelce strike lucrative new distribution deal for their 'New Heights' podcast\nJust in time for football season, NFL superstar Travis Kelce and his recently retired brother Jason have a new -- and extremely lucrative -- publisher for their popular \"New Heights\" podcast.\nAmazon's Wondery will take over all ad sales and distribution rights for the Kelce brothers' weekly show as part of the agreement announced Tuesday.\n\"Wondery understands the shared vision and will offer a wealth of experience and resources to take us to new heights!\" Travis and Jason Kelce said in a statement. \"We are going to create some groundbreaking moments together through this partnership. We are thrilled to start Season 3 \u2014 see you soon, 92%ers!\"\nVariety reports the deal is for three years and more than $100 million.\nThe Kelce brothers began their \"New Heights\" podcast two years ago and it has grown into what Wondery CEO Jen Sargent calls \"a cultural phenomenon.\"\nIn addition to their insider football knowledge from a combined 24 years in the NFL, the Kelces often tap into their personal lives, pop culture and other random topics on their podcast. And of course, the show's popularity gained even greater visibility from Travis Kelce's budding romance with musical megastar Taylor Swift.\nThe new deal will provide ad-free access to Wondery+ subscribers and allow the company to create new products and sell merchandise based on the \"New Heights\" podcast.\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news \u2014 fast.

      "text": "Travis Kelce talks being Taylor Swift's 'plus one'\nFor Travis Kelce, \"plus one\" is a badge of honor.\nThe Kansas City Chiefs' tight end, who has in recent years become arguably the most famous boyfriend on the planet, revealed in a recent interview that when your date is Taylor Swift, being a sidekick isn't half bad.\n\"I get to be the plus one,\" he told GQ in a cover story published Tuesday, Aug. 12. \"I get to go and be that fan. Because I am a fan. I'm a fan of music. I'm a fan of art.\" Kelce, a star in his own right, was spotted by fans at several different shows throughout Swift's career-defining, local-economy-lifting Eras Tour. He even appeared on stage at one of them, joining Swift midway through a set of songs from her latest album, \"The Tortured Poets Department.\"\nThe real-life equivalent of a joint Instagram post, Kelce and Swift have made their love the stuff of legends. She shifts her lyrics at shows to reference their romance. He points up at the box after a play, where she sits with her celebrity friends.\nHis interview follows a guest appearance teaser by Swift on the \"New Heights\" podcast, which Kelce hosts alongside his brother Jason. In it, she unveiled a new album (and likely era): \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"\nSwift, 35, chose to appear on Kelce's podcast rather than visiting a traditional news outlet. That's part of the charm of dating someone within the entertainment industry, Kelce says.\n\"I hadn't experienced somebody in the same shoes as me, having a partner who understands the scrutiny, understands the ups and downs of being in front of millions,\" Kelce, 35, told GQ. \"That was very relatable, seeing how exhausted she would get after shows. She may not think of herself as an athlete. She will never tell anyone that she is an athlete. But I\u2019ve seen what she goes through. I\u2019ve seen the amount of work that she puts on her body, and it\u2019s mind-blowing.\"\nIt's the intimacy that Swift creates, however, out of a crowd of millions, that stuns Kelce the most.\n\"People gravitate towards how she performs and how she makes it feel like the entire stadium is in this little room with her,\" he told the outlet. \"She is so good at mesmerizing everybody and making everybody feel like it's an intimate situation. I think that alone \u2013 there is so much calm and coolness. She's beautiful. She's up there making everyone feel at ease.\"\nHe's not the only plus one, though.\n\"It's so cool that I get to experience her being that plus one for me on the football field,\" Kelce said. \"I feel that same enjoyment every time she comes to my shows.\""

      "text": "Travis Kelce gushes over Taylor Swift in GQ story: 'We're just two people that are in love'\nLess than seven hours after Taylor Swift announced the title of her 12th album, Travis Kelce is gracing the cover of GQ magazine with a cover story diving into football, his next career move and life dating a superstar.\nThe Kansas City Chiefs tight end opened up about the blinding spotlight of being Swift's \"plus one\" and how he's navigating the pressure, in the more than 6,000 worded article written by Simon and Schuster publisher Sean Manning.\n\"When there is not a camera on us, we're just two people that are in love,\" Kelce said. \"It can be perceived as something else because of how much it is talked about and how much we are tracked whenever we do go out, but I would say that it's as normal of. \u2026 It happened very organically even though from a media standpoint it was being tracked. It still happened very organically.\"\nKelce said one of the most refreshing parts of dating Swift has been realizing how similar their worlds are.\n\"I hadn't experienced somebody in the same shoes as me, having a partner who understands the scrutiny, understands the ups and downs of being in front of millions,\" he said. \"That was very relatable, seeing how exhausted she would get after shows. She may not think of herself as an athlete. She will never tell anyone that she is an athlete. But I've seen what she goes through. I've seen the amount of work that she puts on her body, and it's mind-blowing.\"\nTaylor Swift is 'electric,' Travis Kelce says in GQ\nKelce and Swift have dated since the summer of 2023, which Swift revealed began \"when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,\" she said in her Time magazine Person of the Year article.\n\"We started hanging out right after that. So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I'm grateful for, because we got to get to know each other,\" Swift said in Time. \"By the time I went to that first game,\" the Chiefs versus Bears game in September 2023, where she watched from a suite, \"we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.\"\nKelce followed her to 14 concert stops along the Eras Tour, and she changed the \"Karma\" lyrics every night he attended to, \"Karma is the guy on the Chiefs coming straight home to me.\"\nIn the GQ article, Kelce called the show \"electric\" and said he's amazed by the singer-songwriter's stamina.\n\"To go out on a stage, on a computer, essentially, for three hours,\" he says. \"The (Eras Tour) floor is literally \u2013 I've seen underneath that thing. It is a football-field-sized computer. You take that into Singapore, where it is scorching hot, and all of a sudden you're feeling the fumes from the computer and you're feeling the fumes from the sun and you're doing a show for three hours with a lot of energy, bringing it every single song. That is arguably more exhausting than how much I put in on a Sunday, and she\u2019s doing it three, four, five days in a row.\"\nTaylor Swift's 12th era involves Travis Kelce\nSwift included her boyfriend and his brother in announcing her newest project, \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"\nAt 12:12 a.m. ET on Aug. 12, a \"New Heights\" podcast teaser video showed Swift and Kelce next to each other as she revealed to Jason Kelce the album cover.\nKelce has become the conduit of news for Swift. In addition to changing the lyrics, she invited him on stage during her showgirl portion of the show to carry her into \"I Can Do It With A Broken Heart.\" She also did a last-minute surprise at Tight End University, an event he cohosts, performing \"Shake It Off.\"\nAlthough he doesn't say when his last season will be with the NFL, Kelce told GQ, \"Nowadays, I just want to be respected and loved by the people that I\u2019m surrounded by in my work.\n\"I want to leave it better than where it was when I started,\" he said, before invoking Swift. \"And I see her having those same values.\"\nDon't miss any Taylor Swift news; sign up for the free, weekly newsletter This Swift Beat.\nFollow Bryan West, the USA TODAY Network's Taylor Swift reporter, on Instagram, TikTok and X as @BryanWestTV."

      "text": "How Travis Kelce made Taylor Swift, his superstar girlfriend, a football fan\n- Travis Kelce says Taylor Swift is a big football fan now, understanding game intricacies.\n- Kelce enjoys being Swift's plus-one at her events, just as she is at his games.\n- Swift announced her new album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" on Kelce's podcast, \"New Heights.\"\nTaylor Swift is a full-fledged football fan now, and it's mostly because of Travis Kelce.\nThe Kansas City Chiefs tight end declared this in a new GQ cover story released Tuesday ahead of the start to the 2025 NFL season. Swift, of course, has frequently been spotted at Kelce's games, particularly at Arrowhead Stadium, since the two stars began dating two years ago.\nAnd it appears she's successfully been learning the intricacies of the sport thanks to her boyfriend.\n\"I sort of made her a football fan,\" Kelce said in the interview. \"She is the most engulfed fan now. She knows what the injury reports look like. She understands what special situations are, third and short \u2013 all these things because she just naturally loves to hear about my job.\"\nKelce spoke on a number of topics with GQ, but the latest comments on his relationship with Swift drew crossover attention. The two have been a pop culture fascination the past two seasons, with Swift's appearances at Chiefs games to watch Kelce and Kelce's appearances at Swift's concerts chronicled worldwide.\nSwift grew up in West Reading, Pennsylvania as a Philadelphia Eagles fan, and her song \"Gold Rush\" even includes a lyric alluding to her fandom. But those days are over. Kelce expressed satisfaction with their dynamic when supporting one another, and the reality that her celebrity overshadows his.\n\"I get to be the plus-one,\" Kelce said. \"I get to go and be that fan. Because I am a fan. I\u2019m a fan of music. I\u2019m a fan of art. And it\u2019s so cool that I get to experience her being that plus-one for me on the football field. \u2026 I feel that same enjoyment every time she comes to my shows.\"\nKelce did not talk about retirement from football in specific terms, but reiterated he's interested in remaining involved with the game once his career is over while also exploring a potential move into acting or entertainment. He recently had a cameo role in \"Happy Gilmore 2\" and served as the host of \"Are You Smarter Than a Celebrity\" on Amazon Prime. He also co-hosts the popular \"New Heights\" podcast with his brother, former Philadelphia Eagles center and current ESPN NFL analyst Jason Kelce, which is reportedly worth $100 million after being licensed by Wonderly last year.\nSwift announced her new album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" during a clip released on social media ahead of an upcoming appearance on \"New Heights\" on Wednesday night. It means Kelce has officially gone from coaching Swift up on football to collaborating with her on PR rollouts.\nFor football's most famous couple, it's yet another sign of a healthy relationship.\n\"When you see me hanging out at the US Open with Taylor, it may look like the two of us are partying,\" Kelce told GQ. \"But I\u2019m just enjoying the fun of being at this really cool event that I always wanted to go to with the person that I love.\"\nWhen does 'The Life of a Showgirl' drop?\nIn a teaser social media video, Taylor Swift appeared with Travis Kelce on his podcast, \"New Heights,\" which he co-hosts with his brother, Jason Kelce. During the episode, she revealed a mint green briefcase featuring her initials and announced that it contained her new album. On Swift's official website, there is a countdown leading to 12:12 a.m. ET, where fans can preorder \"The Life of a Showgirl\" on vinyl, cassette, or CD, complete with a poster.\nNo additional information has been disclosed yet, including the album cover image. Fans will have to wait until the \"New Heights\" podcast releases on Wednesday, Aug. 13, at 7 p.m. ET for more details."
