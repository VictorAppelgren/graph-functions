  "description": "A district court judge\u2019s partial finding of fair use in a copyright infringement case brought by a group of authors against AI developer Anthropic in June",
  "content": "A district court judge\u2019s partial finding of fair use in a copyright infringement case brought by a group of authors against AI developer Anthropic in June sent shockwaves through the technology and copyright legal worlds. But the court\u2019s subsequent ruling to certify the remaining charge against Anthropic over its downloading millions of pirated books for training as a class action has set off a veritable earthquake.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nThe designated class could contain as many as seven million putative claimants, and with potential statutory damages of up to $150,000 per work, Anthropic could be on the hook for tens of billions of dollars should the court find in favor of the class plaintiffs.\n\nOn July 31, Anthropic filed a petition with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals for permission to appeal the district court\u2019s class certification. Now, technology industry groups and consumer and advocacy organizations have separately petitioned to join the case as amici curiae on behalf of Anthropic.\n\nThe two groups of amici raise different issues with the district court\u2019s certification ruling, but each frames the case in near-existential terms. \u201cDistrict courts have a duty to take a hard look at class certification,\u201d the technology groups said in their filing. \u201cThis case illustrates exactly why. A comparatively straightforward lawsuit filed by three individual authors rapidly has morphed into an unprecedented and gargantuan class action that threatens an entire industry with ruinous financial liability. \u201c\n\nThe groups\u2019 brief warned that such potential liability would likely chill investment in the sector. \u201cIf there were indeed seven million claimants, statutory damages of $150,000 per work could exceed the entire gross domestic product of each of 171 countries, including Switzerland,\u201d they wrote. \u201cEven a small risk of incurring such extraordinary damages is coercive enough to force almost any defendant to settle. And in this case, given the immense amount of material required to train large language models and the liability risk posed by erroneous class certification, allowing this certification to stand undoubtedly will chill investment and innovation in AI. \u201c\n\nThe consumer groups\u2019 petition approaches the problem with the size of the putative class a by emphasizing the lack of common interests and the difficulty of identifying all rights owners who could be entitled to claim a portion of any settlement or judgment in favor of the class.\n\n\u201cAs our proposed brief explains, the district court in certifying this class engaged in almost no analysis of the contents of the books at issue in this suit, nor the interests of their copyright holders,\u201d they wrote. \u201cBecause class certification turns on whether \u2018there are questions of law or fact common to the class,\u2019 understanding the complex and messy rights issues in this case is critical for this court to make a well-informed decision.\u201d\n\nThe groups point out that many of them have first-hand experience with class action copyright cases, including the widely referenced Google Books case (Authors Guild v. Google), and suggest it offers a cautionary tale.\n\n\u201cThat suit spanned over ten years and involved multiple attempts at class-wide settlement,\u201d they note. \u201cAmici have firsthand experience through that suit with the problems that inadequate representation can cause for absent rightsholders whose views sharply diverge from those who claim to represent them\u2026 We seek to help this Court understand why the district court\u2019s failure to adequately consider these deep conflicts within the class is so significant as to constitute manifest error.\u201d\n\nThe Ninth Circuit has yet to rule on the various petitions.",
