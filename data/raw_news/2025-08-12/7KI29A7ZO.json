  "content": "Welcome to the orange era. Taylor Swift has announced her 12th studio album and is expected to reveal the cover art and more details on the New Heights podcast this week. Here\u2019s everything to know so far about TS12, including clues about its possible release date.\n\nOn Monday, Aug. 11, a cryptic countdown appeared on her website, following a long trail of Easter eggs dating all the way back to her time on the Eras Tour. Perhaps the biggest clue came after Taylor Nation, Swift\u2019s official management team, posted a variety of photos of the singer in orange-hued outfits on Instagram. \u201cThinking about when she said \u201cSee you next era\u2026 \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25\u201d the caption read.\n\nOn the same day, Travis and Jason Kelce\u2019s podcast, New Heights, teased that a very special guest would be joining the brothers this Wednesday \u2014 and the silhouette of the guest looked very similar to Swift\u2019s. The image was also set against a sparkly orange background, which corresponds with the orange-themed outfits from Taylor Nation.\n\nWhat Is The Name Of TS12?\n\nSwift\u2019s 12th studio album is titled The Life of a Showgirl. The announcement was made on the singer\u2019s official website during the early morning hours of August 12. Taylor Nation also posted a clip of Swift sharing the name of the record with Travis and Jason Kelce on their hit sports podcast New Heights.\n\n\u201cAt 12:12 on the 12th, TS12 finally got a name: The Life of a Showgirl. \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25 More info soon\u2026 pre pre-order the album & pre pre-scream in the meantime!!!!!!!!!!!!\u201d Taylor Nation wrote alongside the New Heights teaser.\n\nWhat Is The Life Of A Showgirl Release Date?\n\nThe exact release date for The Life of a Showgirl has yet to be announced. However, according to Taylor\u2019s website, the album will ship by October 13, 2025 \u2014 so the release date will be before then. \u201cThis is not the release date. Official release date to be announced,\" the website clarified.\n\nFor now, you can pre-order the album on Swift\u2019s official website as a CD with a poster ($12.99), cassette ($19.99) and vinyl ($29.99).\n\nWho Are The Producers On The Life Of A Showgirl?\n\nAlong with the album announcement, Swift released a playlist titled And, baby, that\u2019s show business for you \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83d\udd25, which includes 22 tracks from various albums. Swifties were quick to point out that all the songs were produced by the songwriting and production duo, Max Martin and Shellback, with whom the singer collaborated on Red, 1989 and Reputation.\n\nWill The Life Of A Showgirl Feature Any Collabs?\n\nThere\u2019s a strong chance that Sabrina Carpenter will appear on The Life of a Showgirl, thanks to a list of clues, including her website featuring the date August 12, 2025. Carpenter was also included in the 12-photo carousel Taylor Nation posted teasing the pop star\u2019s \u201cnew era.\u201d\n\nHere are more fan guesses about Carpenter\u2019s rumored involvement:\n\nWhen Is Taylor Swift Revealing The Life Of A Showgirl Cover Art?\n\nSwift will be revealing The Life of a Showgirl cover art during the next episode of the New Heights podcast, which will be released on Wednesday, August 13, at 7 p.m. ET.

      "text": "Are you ready for Taylor Swift to begin a new era? Now that the billionaire superstar officially owns her masters, the final two re-recordings are likely taking a backseat. Thanks to the Easter eggs dropped by Swift and her team, Swifties are convinced that new music is coming soon \u2014 and what better way to reveal TS12 than on New Heights?\nThe chatter about Swift\u2019s potential appearance on Travis and Jason Kelce\u2019s podcast, New Heights, started on Monday, August 11, when the podcast's X account teased that a very special guest would be joining the brothers this Wednesday.\n\u201c92%ers, we\u2019re coming back early for a special episode with a VERY special guest,\u201d the caption read. \u201cNew episode Wednesday 7PM ET.\u201d\nSwifties flocked to the comments, noting how the silhouette in the picture looks very similar to Taylor\u2019s \u2014 bangs, long hair, and all.\n\u201cI KNOW THOSE BANGS ANYWHERE HELLO,\u201d one user commented. Another fan noticed that Jason is wearing what appears to be a shirt with the singer\u2019s face on it, and the background is a glittering orange (we\u2019ll get to the significance of the color later). Oh, and the episode drops on the 13th, which just happens to be Taylor\u2019s lucky number.\nIs Taylor Swift Announcing New Music On New Heights This Week?\nIf Swift is a special guest on Wednesday\u2019s episode, there\u2019s a strong chance she could also announce new music. Taylor Nation, the official account of Taylor Swift\u2019s management team, has been dropping hints that the singer may be revealing something big soon.\nOn August 11, the same day as the New Heights teaser, the Taylor Nation Instagram account shared a 12-photo carousel. The caption read, \u201cThinking about when she said \u2018See you next era\u2026\u2019\u201d and the photos showed Swift in a variety of orange Eras Tour looks.\nFans noted that the missing album color in Taylor Swift\u2019s discography is orange, suggesting that TS12 could revolve around the orange hue. \u201cTS12 IS ORANGE DEFINITELY,\" one Swiftie commented. \u201c12 pictures, every outfit is orange. This has to mean something \ud83e\udde1\ud83e\udde1\ud83e\udde1\u201d wrote another.\nWhat Are Other Easter Eggs Pointing To TS12?\nThe Instagram carousel is just one of the Easter eggs hinting that Swift's next album, TS12, is on the horizon. Here are even more signs sleuths have put together:\n- When celebrating a new album from her BFF Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco, Swift posted the caption, \u201cI LOVE THIS ALBUM SO MUCH OH MY GODDDDDDDDDDDD.\u201d The singer used 12 d\u2019s in god.\n- In an Instagram post marking her return to the U.S. for the Era\u2019s Tour, the artist held her cat Meredith in the A12 section of Hard Rock Stadium.\n- At the 2025 Grammy Awards, she had 12 red rubies in her earrings and leg chain.\n- When she revealed that she now owns her masters, the letter included 12 i\u2019s in \u201cthiiiiiiiiiiiis,\u201d while the single numbers in the letter of 4, 6 and 2 add up to 12. The letterhead also featured a new \"TS\" diamond logo with 12 segments.\n- In December, Us Weekly reported Swift was considering getting to \u201cwork on a new album\u201d and was talking \u201cabout hitting the road again\u2014albeit on a smaller scale than the Eras Tour\u2014in 2026.\u201d\nWhen Does the New Heights Podcast Come Out?\nThe New Heights podcast will be released on Wednesday, August 13, at 7 p.m. ET. You can listen to the podcast on Wondery, Apple Music, Spotify, YouTube and more.\nStay tuned to learn more details."

      "text": "Taylor Swift officially landed on Forbes\u2019 billionaires list on Tuesday, April 2. But what distinguishes the 34-year-old singer-songwriter from other wealthy artists is how she accumulated her billion-dollar fortune.\nThe Miss Americana star ranked No. 2,545 on Forbes\u2019 World\u2019s Billionaires List. According to Forbes, there are more billionaires than ever before (141 more than last year and 26 more than the 2021 record), with their collective worth reaching $14.2 trillion. Swift\u2019s inclusion comes after Forbes declared the singer a billionaire in October 2023 and reported her net worth at $1.1 billion.\nIn a rare feat, Swift is the first musician to reach the milestone solely from songwriting and performing. Her fortune doesn\u2019t largely derive from profitable side hustles (think: beauty brands, fashion lines, alcohol investments, etc.), which have been typical avenues for entertainers to become billionaires in recent years. This puts her in a unique category with artists like Bruce Springsteen, who earned $1 billion from on the road touring.\nMore than $500 million of Swift\u2019s fortune is from music royalties and touring. She made an estimated $190 million after taxes from the first leg of the Eras tour and another $35 million from the first two weeks of screenings of the corresponding concert film, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, which became the highest-grossing concert movie in history.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nMeanwhile, another $500 million of her earnings came from the increasing value of her music catalog. Her masters (Swift\u2019s first six albums) were infamously purchased in 2019 by Scooter Braun and eventually sold to Shamrock Capital for $300 million in 2020.\n\u201cThis is my worst case scenario. This is what happens when you sign a deal at fifteen to someone for whom the term \u2018loyalty\u2019 is clearly just a contractual concept,\u201d Swift penned on Tumblr in 2019 when she learned that Braun had bought her masters. \u201cNow Scooter has stripped me of my life\u2019s work, that I wasn\u2019t given an opportunity to buy. Essentially, my musical legacy is about to lie in the hands of someone who tried to dismantle it.\u201d\nAt the time, Swift also parted ways with her long-time home, Big Machine Label Group, to join Universal Music Group\u2019s Republic Records, a deal that would give the superstar complete ownership over songwriting and the recordings, ultimately boosting her earnings in the long run.\n\"I'm ecstatic to announce that my musical home will be Republic Records and Universal Music Group,\" Swift wrote on Instagram about the news. \"Over the years, [UMG chief] Sir Lucian Grainge and [Republic chief] Monte Lipman have been such incredible partners. It's so thrilling to me that they, and the UMG team, will be my label family moving forward. It's also incredibly exciting to know that I'll own all of my master recordings that I make from now on.\"\nSince switching labels, Swift has released four new albums, Lover, Folklore, Evermore and Midnights, and re-recorded Fearless (Taylor\u2019s Version), Red (Taylor\u2019s Version), Speak Now (Taylor\u2019s Version) and 1989 (Taylor\u2019s Version). Swift\u2019s the sole writer on over one-fourth of her top 50 Billboard chart hits, although she frequently shares writing credits with collaborators like Jack Antonoff and Max Martin, who also get a portion of a record sale.\nOn April 19, the pop star will release her 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, which will also add to her massive earnings. Swift announced the new record during her Album of the Year win acceptance speech at the 2024 Grammy Awards in February.\nWhile becoming a billionaire, the singer made a huge monetary impact on the NFL. Swift created a brand value equivalent of $331.5 million for the Chiefs and the league, according to data from Apex Marketing Group. That number comes from print, digital, radio, TV, highlights, and social media mentioning Swift from her first game on Sept. 24 to Jan. 22.\nOne of Swift\u2019s many accomplishments from last year also includes being named Time Magazine\u2019s 2023 Person of the Year. In her interview with journalist Sam Lansky, Swift told the magazine that \u201cthis is the proudest and happiest I\u2019ve ever felt, and the most creatively fulfilled and free I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d"
