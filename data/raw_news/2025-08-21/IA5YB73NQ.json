  "title": "Tech Moves: Seattle Chamber CEO joins Washington Roundtable; Meta and F5 leaders depart",
  "description": "In Pacific Northwest tech moves, leaders at Meta and F5 depart for unknown new roles while Seattle Chamber's CEO leaves for Washington Roundtable.",
  "content": "\u2014 Rachel Smith, president and CEO of the Seattle Metro Chamber, is leaving her role at the business advocacy organization to become president of the Washington Roundtable.\n\nSmith has led the chamber since 2021, guiding it through the COVID recovery, supporting BIPOC-owned businesses, working on Sound Transit expansion and other issues.\n\nOver her career, Smith has worked in numerous Seattle-area civic roles including leadership in King County and City of Seattle government offices. She will continue engaging with the Seattle Metro Chamber in her new role at Washington Roundtable, which is a nonprofit that works to influence public policy and is composed of senior executives from major companies in the state.\n\nGabriella Buono, the chamber\u2019s chief impact officer, will serve as interim president and CEO while the board of trustees seeks a permanent leader.\n\n\u2014 Michael Atalla is leaving F5 after nearly four years, resigning from the role of senior vice president and head of worldwide marketing. Atalla said it was \u201chard to capture\u201d what his time has meant at the Seattle-based security and application delivery giant.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the privilege of working with some of the smartest, kindest, most relentlessly curious people in the business \u2014 and I don\u2019t take that for granted,\u201d he said on LinkedIn.\n\nAtalla\u2019s career includes nearly 14 years at Microsoft, ending in 2016 as a director with the Office 365 group. He also co-founded The MJJM Group, which advises business clients on product growth and supports fundraising efforts. Atalla has not disclosed his next step.\n\n\u2014 Generative AI principal engineer Hitesh Jain is leaving Meta. Jain has been with the company for more than 13 years, most recently working to personalize AI chatbots so they are \u201chelpful and engaging,\u201d he said in his LinkedIn profile.\n\nIn announcing his departure, Jain said he joined the Meta straight out of the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee in India. \u201cMoving halfway across the world to the U.S. was an unexpected leap \u2014 but one of the best decisions of my life,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat started as just a job quickly became a defining chapter of my journey. Over the years, I had the privilege of working from Seattle, [Menlo Park, Calif.], and Dublin.\u201d\n\nTech companies are scrambling to hire top AI talent, with Meta reportedly offering salaries of $100 million per year. Jain did not name his next role, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s the start of a new chapter for me. Stay tuned for what\u2019s next.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Adriana Gil Miner stepped down from her role as chief marketing and strategy officer at Iterable. Miner held the post for more than three years, and said on LinkedIn that she loved the chance to \u201cmarket to marketers\u201d at the San Francisco-based B2B company.\n\n\u201cFew marketers get the opportunity to meet the people behind the brands you love and use every day,\u201d Miner said on LinkedIn.\n\nBefore joining Iterable, Miner held leadership roles at multiple Seattle-area companies, serving as senior vice president of marketing for Tableau Software and CMO of both Qumulo and Artefact. She did not share her next move.\n\n\u2014 Former WatchGuard Technologies CEO Prakash Panjwani joined the board of directors for Starfire Sports. The organization provides coding classes, drone summer camps, and other free, after-school sports programming for underprivileged kids in South Seattle.\n\n\u201cI strongly believe that we have a tremendous opportunity to influence our youth in their early years by offering them exposure to everything from sports to STEM so that they are better prepared to contribute positively to society,\u201d Panjwani said in a statement.\n\n\u2014 Seattle industrial analytics company Seeq named Anton Chilton to its board of directors. Chilton was with manufacturing and supply chain solutions company QAD for more than two decades, rising to the role of CEO. Seeq uses AI, analytics, and monitoring to data that helps industrial businesses optimize their operations.",

      "text": "Leaving Meta \ud83d\udc99 Hi LinkedIn, after 13 incredible years, I\u2019ve decided to move on from Meta. I joined Meta (then Facebook) straight out of IIT Roorkee in India. Moving halfway across the world to the U.S. was an unexpected leap \u2014 but one of the best decisions of my life. What started as just a job quickly became a defining chapter of my journey. Over the years, I had the privilege of working from Seattle, MPK, and Dublin. Along the way, I learned what it truly means to build reliable, intelligent, and safe software at scale. More importantly, I found mentors, collaborators, and lifelong friends. Meta has been more than a workplace \u2014 it\u2019s where I grew up, stumbled, learned, and celebrated wins both big and small. I\u2019ll carry the memories, lessons, and friendships with me wherever I go.

Delivering this platform involved building a dedicated product team within my marketing organization to architect, develop, and maintain this always on environment. The product addressed the challenge of providing sales organizations within Microsoft and in the Microsoft partner community an easy way to spin up a fully formed demo environment based on the latest technologies. My team delivered carefully curated content packs which, when orchestrated, generated an Office 365 environment which looked like an actively running business, with email, documents, libraries, meetings scheduled, etc. all by vertical and geography. A seller could, on any one day, spin up an entire demo ecosystem, customized with company name and industry focus, with the click of a button and just as easily reset that environment for the next demo. Detailed content plans and extensive demo guides made this an incredibly popular tool across the Microsoft ecosystem. Developed initially as a demo environment for Microsoft Exchange Online, our team expanded its mission to cover the entire Office 365 environment and then beyond that to encompass Dynamics and System Center components. The result of this project was a durable and highly functional tool that became fundamental to the way Microsoft and its partners sell to commercial customers.\n-\nMicrosoft Exchange Conference\n-\nSee projectAs the Microsoft Exchange business shifted from Server to Service (SaaS), our tight partnership with the Exchange Administrator community, upon which much of our success was anchored, was at risk.

This community viewed SaaS, at the time, as technology that would reduce their control, put their companies at risk, and put them out of a job. To reinvigorate our relationship with this critical technical community and put ourselves on footing to leverage the community to not only preserve our Server business but grow our SaaS business, I conceived of, led the planning for, and execution of the Microsoft Exchange Conference, returning the event to the Microsoft after being suspended 10 years earlier. This event met with critical success and drove a wave of positive sentiment. By taking a community-centric focus and helping to establish that it was this community that would lead the transition to the cloud, rather than Microsoft, we built meaningful credibility which translated into advocacy from influential and outspoken IT leaders and built momentum with customers in the midst of the cloud migration decision making process. Establishing a social media movement (leveraging hashtag #iammec) and connecting the event theme and community identity to that social media movement produced a tightly integrated marketing plan that went well beyond the physical event space and gave the community and the Exchange product team a shared context upon which we successfully rebuilt our advocacy network and formed the basis of our continued dominance in this segment despite a growing threat from Google and other smaller cloud-only vendors.\nLanguages\n-\nEnglish\n-\nRecommendations received\n2 people have recommended Michael\nJoin now to viewOther similar profiles\nExplore top content on LinkedIn\nFind curated posts and insights for relevant topics all in one place.\nView top contentOthers named Michael Atalla in United States\n-\nMichael Atalla\nCorporate Associate at Alston & Bird\n-\nMichael Atalla\ncomputer tech at Hewlett-Packard\n-\nMichael A.\nMIMG | University of California, Los Angeles | HSF/YLS Scolar\n-\nMichael Atalla\nDriver at UPS\n5 others named Michael Atalla in United States are on LinkedIn\nSee others named Michael Atalla"
