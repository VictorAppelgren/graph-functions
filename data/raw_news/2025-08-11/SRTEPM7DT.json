  "content": "NEED TO KNOW\n\u2022 None Billy Crystal posted a remembrance of his late friend Robin Williams, who died 11 years ago, on Instagram\n\u2022 None The post consisted of a throwback photo of the two actors on the set of the 1997 comedy Fathers' Day\n\nBilly Crystal is remembering his friend, the late Robin Williams.\n\nCrystal, 77, posted a photo on his Instagram account Monday, Aug. 11, dedicated to Williams, who died in 2014 at age 63.\n\nThe throwback shot of Crystal and Williams captured a candid moment of the two laughing together. \"Miss you my friend,\" he captioned the photo.\n\nThe photo appears to be taken on the set of the 1997 film Fathers' Day, directed by Ivan Reitman and starring Williams, Crystal, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Nastassja Kinski and Sugar Ray.\n\nThe two longtime friends led the comedy as men with the same former lover, who sends them on a mission to recover her son, who may be the offspring of either man.\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer\u200b\u200b, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nWilliams died by suicide 11 years ago ,on Aug. 11, 2014, at his Paradise Cay mansion in San Francisco, after dealing with an undiagnosed case of a debilitating brain disorder called Lewy Body Dementia (LBD).\n\nAfter becoming stand-up comedians and movie stars around the same time, Williams, Crystal and Whoopi Goldberg teamed up in 1986 to host regular televised events for Comic Relief USA, the non-profit charity founded by Richard Curtis and Sir Lenny Henry that provides relief for homeless people.\n\nGoldberg, 69, and the When Harry Met Sally star have mourned and celebrated their late pal more than once. At the 2023 Kennedy Center Honors, the two held back tears, mentioning their partnership with Williams, and in October 2024, Crystal joined The View to reminisce about him.\n\nCrystal and Williams solidified their friendship at many Hollywood events throughout the \u201980s and \u201990s. Following the release of Fathers' Day, the Analyze This star hosted 1998\u2019s 70th Academy Awards, the ceremony in which Williams won his supporting actor Oscar for Good Will Hunting.\n\nThe Mrs. Doubtfire star was survived by three children: sons Zachary \"Zak\" Williams and Cody Alan Williams and daughter Zelda Williams. On July 22, Zak honored his father on what would have been the late actor\u2019s 74th birthday.\n\n\u201cFor me, grief isn\u2019t linear,\u201d he wrote on Instagram. \u201cIt loops and echoes. It softens, then crescendos. But alongside it lives a legacy, the kind built not from fame or recognition, but from generosity and relentless kindness.\u201d",

Inset: Getty Images Robin Williams's home in the San Francisco Bay area has officially sold for $5.35 million after being on the market for almost one year. PEOPLE confirmed in November 2019 that the six-bedroom, six-and-a-half bathroom estate, located in Tiburon, California, had been listed with Penny Wright-Mulligan and Haley Wright of Compass for $7.25 million, making the final sale price $1.9 million less than asking. Set on a double lot along the water, the late Good Will Hunting actor lived in the Mediterranean-style mansion until his death by suicide at age 63 in 2014. He was found dead in the home after police responded to a 911 call. Following his death, a heated legal battle over the property began in December 2014, when his widow, Susan Schneider Williams, claimed that she was not receiving enough money from the actor's estate to maintain the home she shared with him before his death. Williams's children, Zachary, Zelda and Cody, had said that their stepmother was \"adding insult to a terrible injury\" by trying to change the trust and that they were \"heartbroken\" that she had \"acted against his wishes by challenging the plans he so carefully made for his estate.\" The dispute was settled out of court in October 2015.

Credit : Alexandra Wyman/WireImage Robin Williams passed on his comedic and acting genes to his daughter, Zelda Williams. The late Jumanji actor welcomed his second child and only daughter on July 31, 1989, with his second wife Marsha Garces. He also is a father to son Zak with his first wife Valerie Velardi and Cody Alan with Garces. After his tragic death by suicide in 2014, all three of his children rallied together and put their efforts toward supporting mental health causes. Zelda has taken after her father, working as an actor and director in Hollywood with her first feature-length directorial debut Lisa Frankenstein out in February 2024. However, she previously told PEOPLE in 2017 that she didn\u2019t grow up thinking she would be following in his footsteps. \"I didn't go into acting with any ideas of where I'd wind up,\" she said. \"Maybe this is pessimistic, but I knew I was never going to be my father, so I went into it because I love it.\" Meet Robin Williams\u2019 3 Kids: Everything to Know About Zak, Zelda and Cody From how she dealt with her father\u2019s death to her directorial debut, here\u2019s everything to know about Robin Williams\u2019 daughter, Zelda Williams.

Gregg DeGuire/WireImage Robin and Garces welcomed their first child together on July 31, 1989. The Jumanji actor explained that Zelda\u2019s name came from the video game The Legend of Zelda, which they played while Garces was pregnant, he said during an ad campaign with Nintendo in June 2011. \u201cA lot of people come up and ask if she\u2019s named after F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s wife,\u201d Robin said in the spot. \u201cNo, it\u2019s Zelda for The Legends of Zelda.\u201d Zelda, who was also in the interview, said she used to think about changing her name when she was young, but as she got older, she liked it more, and that it was chosen after a princess. \u201cIt\u2019s magical,\u201d Robin explained. \u201cAs she is, which is amazing.\u201d She and Robin had their own family traditions, including cooking Robin Williams and Zelda Williams during the World Premiere of \"Happy Feet\". SGranitz/WireImage In December 2023, Zelda spoke with PEOPLE about what the holidays meant to her family and how they upheld their traditions, like cooking, year-round. \u201cDad's job made it pretty hard to keep anything like a yearly tradition really, aside from Thanksgiving or days when sets would shut down,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we didn't really have much in the way of that, but cooking together was a big part of our family. We would eat together every Tuesday, however many family members were in town.\u201d She added that while \u201cnot everybody\u201d was the most skilled in the kitchen, they all made an effort to be present. \u201cMy brothers and my dad were not good cooks,\u201d she joked, adding, \u201cBut my mom and I would take part, and it was a big part of our family.\u201d Regardless of each individual member\u2019s cooking skills, Zelda said the point of their Tuesday cooking sessions was to have guaranteed time together amidst everyone\u2019s busy lives. \u201cBeing together was the important thing, because otherwise, especially with people scattered to the wind with work, it became even more special to do that,\" she explained. She was accepting of her parents' divorce Robin Williams and daughter Zelda at the premiere of \"RV\" on April 23, 2006 in Los Angeles, California. Kevin Winter/Getty When Zelda was 18, her parents split. However, she told PEOPLE in 2008 that it wasn\u2019t a \u201ccomplete surprise,\u201d and her family was still a close unit. \u201cIt's never easy to end,\u201d she said. \u201c[But] there is no bitterness \u2014 we're all a family.\u201d She added that she gave her parents credit for lasting nearly 20 decades, and just wished for them to be happy. Her parents\u2019 split coincided with Robin taking on fewer roles, which she said allowed him to have a bigger presence in her life. \u201cHe's taking more of a break,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cHe's not doing four films a year; he's doing one or two \u2026 Now he has more time for us.\u201d She was \u201cfascinated\u201d by her dad\u2019s acting career, inspiring her to pursue her own Robin Williams and his daughter Zelda Williams arrive at the screening of \"House Of D\" during the 2004 Tribeca Film Festival May 7, 2004. Matthew Peyton/Getty Zelda grew up on sets and around legendary actors and directors from a young age, capturing her attention in the industry early in life. \"I was fascinated by it early,\" Zelda told Entertainment Tonight of accompanying Robin to work. \"When you're that young, I don't think you grasp that it's a job, really; just like a fun thing you go and visit.\" Zelda recalled being behind the scenes of the 1999 sci-fi dramedy Bicentennial Man, marveling over the \u201cbeautiful\u201d set. \"That was when I was old enough to really understand that there was a whole bunch of jobs you could also do,\u201d she said. Now, Zelda has made TV appearances in shows like The Legend of Korra, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Jane The Virgin and her directorial debut, Lisa Frankenstein, is set to release in February 2024. The movie features Cole Sprouse and Kathryn Newton as the latter's character brings a zombie to life in the spooky comedy. \u201cStill not sure it has sunk in yet that all this stuff is just 'out' now, instead of existing as dozens of emails and texts behind the scenes,\u201d Zelda wrote on Instagram ahead of the movie\u2019s release. She relied on her friends\u2019 support after her dad\u2019s death Zelda Williams and Robin Williams arrive at the \"Old Dogs\" Premiere on November 9, 2009 in Hollywood, California. John Shearer/WireImage Robin died by suicide on Aug. 11, 2014, at 63 years old \u2014 just two weeks after Zelda\u2019s 25th birthday. Following his death, Zelda tweeted a passage from Antoine de Saint-Exupery\u2019s The Little Prince. \u201cYou \u2013 you alone will have the stars as no one else has them,\u201d she wrote in a since-deleted tweet. \u201cIn one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night.\u201d In her own words, she added: \u201cI love you. I miss you. I\u2019ll try to keep looking up.\u201d Three years later, in a conversation with PEOPLE in May 2017, Zelda said she leaned on her friends during the challenging time. \u201cI did have those friends who were lovely and I really appreciate when they were like, \u2018Come on! Let\u2019s go to Disneyland!\u2019 and I was like, \u2018No, not today. Having a panic attack today,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cBut the ones who would show up and brought groceries, sat down with me and just wanted to be there, those people made a huge difference.\u201d The actress added that during the days when she had a particularly hard morning, she had friends who would bring everything from mimosas to eggs, helping her talk her feelings out. \u201cThey helped enormously in making me open up to people so I didn\u2019t keep it all in and kind of get to a place of going, \u2018This will never not have happened,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cYou have to move forward without trying to push it aside, \u2019cause that doesn\u2019t help.\u201d She takes a social media break on the anniversary of her father\u2019s death every year Robin Williams and his daughter Zelda Williams attend the after party for \"House Of D\" on May 7, 2004 in New York City. Scott Gries/Getty Around the time of her father\u2019s death anniversary every year, Zelda chooses to stay off social media, explaining that it can be difficult to balance her own emotions as well as everyone else reminiscing and grieving. \"For those who always ask why, it\u2019s so people can memorialize Dad on the anniversary of his death however they wish without me having to feel bombarded by it, or pressured by the expectation put on myself or my family to publicly acknowledge or join in doing so,\u201d she explained in a since-deleted post on X in August 2016. She encouraged others to memorialize her father in whatever way they chose, before adding she would do so privately. Four years later, in August 2020, Zelda announced that she would again be steering clear of social media around the anniversary of his death. \"It's hard for me on regular, good day to remain the person expected to graciously accept the world's need to share their memories of him and express their condolences for his loss,\" Zelda wrote in a since-deleted message on X, formerly known as Twitter. \"As I've said in the past, while I am constantly touched by all your boundless continued love for him, some days it can feel a bit like being seen as a roadside memorial \u2014 a place, not a person \u2014 where people drive past and leave their sentiments to then go about their days comforted their love for him was witnessed.\" On the 10 year anniversary of her father's death in August 2024, Zelda took the opportunity to correct a rumor on X (formerly Twitter) that claimed Robin had a pet monkey. Resharing the post, which featured a photo of Robin with a monkey on his shoulder, Zelda wrote, \"It\u2019s been brought to my attention some probably AI written BS like this is going viral. Dad didn\u2019t own a pet monkey, NO ONE should, and if you\u2019re ever tempted to, support your local exotic animal rescues instead. That is his Night at the Museum costar, who now lives at one.\" She has been passionate about mental health advocacy since his death Robin Williams and Zelda Williams at the 33rd Annual People's Choice Awards on January 9, 2007 in Los Angeles, California. Stephen Shugerman/Getty In December 2021, Zelda and her brother Zak attended Bring Change to Mind's 9th annual \"Revels and Revelations\" event which raises awareness in support of teen mental health efforts. Zelda also often posts messages advocating for mental health and coping with depression on her social media. A year after her father died, in September 2015, Zelda wrote a message of positivity in a since-deleted post on Instagram, urging those who are struggling to not ignore their sadness and to also cherish their moments of joy. \u201cAnd for those suffering from depression, I know how dark and endless that tunnel can feel, but if happiness seems impossible to find, please hold on to the possibility of hope, faint though it may be,\u201d she wrote.

Williams reprised his role as Theodore Roosevelt in Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb shortly before his death, with filming wrapping up in May 2014 three months before Williams died by suicide that August. He was 63. In Robin's Wish, a new documentary focused on the final months of Williams' life, Secret of the Tomb director Shawn Levy says Williams was having a hard time on set. The actor had been struggling with Diffuse Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) for months, which causes fluctuations in mental status, hallucinations and impairment of motor function. \"I would say a month into the shoot, it was clear to me \u2014 it was clear to all of us on that set \u2014 that something was going on with Robin,\" Levy says in a clip from the documentary, made available to Entertainment Tonight. \"We saw that Robin was struggling in a way that he hadn't before to remember lines and to combine the right words with the performance.\" \"When Robin would call me at 10 at night, at two in the morning, at four in the morning, saying, 'Is it usable? Is any of this usable? Do I suck? What's going on?' I would reassure him. I said, 'You are still you. I know it. The world knows it.

It's the second-most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Among those interviewed in the film is Williams' widow, Susan Schneider Williams. \"Armed with the name of a brain disease I'd never heard of, I set out on a mission to understand it, and that led me down my unchosen path of advocacy,\" Schneider Williams told Entertainment Weekly in a statement. \"With invaluable help from leading medical experts, I saw that what Robin and I had gone through, finally made sense \u2014 our experience matched up with the science.\" \"And what I discovered along the way was bigger than me and bigger than Robin,\" she continued. \"The full story was revealed during the making of this film, and it holds the truth that Robin and I had been searching for.\" Explaining the movie's title and Williams' main \"wish,\" Schneider Williams said the Oscar winner \"wanted to help all of us be less afraid.\" \"We had been discussing what we wanted our legacies to be in life; when it was our time to go, how we wanted to have made people feel,\" she recalled. \"Without missing a beat, Robin said, 'I want to help people be less afraid.'\" Close Read more: Celebrity Celebrity Deaths Celebrity Death News"

While speaking to PEOPLE in December 2023, Zelda said that since her father's busy schedule made it hard for their family to keep holiday traditions, they bonded in the kitchen all year round instead. \u201cWe didn't really have much in the way of that, but cooking together was a big part of our family,\" she said. \"We would eat together every Tuesday, however many family members were in town.\u201d Zelda admitted that even though both Robin and her brothers were \"not good cooks,\" the real point of their gatherings was spending time together. \u201cBeing together was the important thing, because otherwise, especially with people scattered to the wind with work, it became even more special to do that,\" she said.

      "text": "See Robin Williams in His Most Beloved Roles, 11 Years After the Comedian's Death The Oscar-winning actor left a lasting impact on audiences, showcasing his versatility and range on-screen over his almost four-decades-long career By Nate Jones and Liam Mathews Liam Mathews Liam Mathews is a writer and editor. He has written for TV Guide, TheWrap, Men's Health, and many other publications. People Editorial Guidelines Published on August 11, 2025 08:00AM EDT 4 Comments Robin Williams as Peter Pan in 1991's 'Hook'; Robin Williams as Mrs. Doubtfire/Daniel Hillard in 1993's 'Mrs Doubtfire'; Robin Williams as John Keating in 1989's 'Dead Poets Society'. Credit : Murray Close/Sygma via Getty; 20th Century Fox/Blue Wolf/Kobal/Shutterstock; Touchstone Pictures/Getty Robin Williams made the world laugh, cry, dance and sing for almost 40 years. After struggling with an undiagnosed case of the debilitating brain disorder Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), the prolific actor and comedian died by suicide at age 63 on Aug. 11, 2014, at his Paradise Cay mansion in San Francisco. Williams \u2014 who was born in Chicago \u2014 left behind an extraordinary legacy on-screen and onstage, emerging as a stand-up comedian in San Francisco and Los Angeles in the 1970s. However, it was his role as the hilarious, off-kilter alien Mork from Ork on the sitcom Happy Days and its spinoff Mork & Mindy that launched the comedic actor into stardom. By the late '80s, Williams transitioned to film, starring as a defiant military disc jockey in 1987's Good Morning, Vietnam and an inspiring English professor at a prestigious boarding school in 1989's Dead Poets Society. He then captivated and enchanted audiences of all ages in family comedies such as Hook (1991), Aladdin (1992) and Mrs. Doubtfire (1993) before taking home a Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1998 for his moving performance as a therapist in the coming-of-age movie Good Will Hunting. With a diverse resum\u00e9 spanning decades and genres, he effectively brought high-energy comedy, improvisation and emotional vulnerability to each character he played. Not only does Williams' creative legacy live on in classic movies and shows, but his daughter Zelda also inherited her father's funny bone and acting chops. The filmmaker made her feature-length directorial debut in the 2024 horror comedy Lisa Frankenstein. On the 11th anniversary of his death, take a look back at some of Williams' most unforgettable roles. Mork on Mork & Mindy Robin Williams as Mork on a 1978 pilot episode of 'Mork & Mindy'. Walt Disney Television via Getty Williams' breakout role came as playing Mork, an alien sent from the planet Ork to study humans. After guest-starring on an episode of Happy Days in 1978, Williams' zany character proved so popular that ABC cast him as the lead a year later on the spinoff Mork & Mindy, opposite Pam Dawber as his human love interest Mindy McConnell. Through Mork, Williams' comedic sensibilities reached a national audience for the first time. Dawber has since recounted fond memories of being on the show, describing Williams as \"such a nice person\" in Dave Itzkoff's 2018 biography Robin while detailing some of his inappropriate behavior on set. \"I had the grossest things done to me by him, and I never took offense,\" Dawber said, per excerpts obtained by the Daily Mail. \"I mean, I was flashed, humped, bumped, grabbed. I think he probably did it to a lot of people \u2026 but it was so much fun.\" Garp in The World According to Garp Robin Williams as T.S. Garp and Mary Beth Hurt as Helen Holm in 1982's 'The World According to Garp'. Moviestore/Shutterstock In his first dramatic role in the 1982 film The World According to Garp, Williams took the lead in the screen adaptation of John Irving's classic novel as T.S. Garp, a contemplative author wrestling (sometimes literally) with notions of family and sexuality. The acclaimed dramedy dives into serious topics with humor and features Oscar-nominated stars John Lithgow and Glenn Close. Close later described what it was like working with Williams during filming. \"Robin was so wonderful. He worked hard and had that great gift of making people laugh when they needed to,\" Close, who played Jenny Fields, told Variety in 2018. Close also revealed that she sought out the late comedian for advice ahead of hosting Saturday Night Live for the first time in 1989. \"I said, 'Do you have any advice about Saturday Night Live?' And he said, 'Just don't do anything you don't think is funny, because you get all these different fabulous ideas.' \" Close told PEOPLE in 2025 before adding, \"I found that helpful.\" Adrian Cronauer in Good Morning, Vietnam Robin Williams as Adrian Cronauer in 1987's 'Good Morning, Vietnam'. Sunset Boulevard/Getty The beloved actor received his first Oscar nomination for playing Armed Forces Radio Services DJ Adrian Cronauer \u2014 a rebellious radio broadcaster who entertained in-country troops during the Vietnam War \u2014 in 1987's Good Morning, Vietnam. The film's broadcast scenes proved that his manic improvisations could work in a \"serious\" film. The real Cronauer, who died in 2018, was an Air Force veteran and broadcaster. The movie tells a fictionalized version of his time in Vietnam; however, Williams based some of his performance on Cronauer. \"He did play rock and roll, he did do characters to introduce standard Army announcements, and 'Goooood morning, Vietnam' really was his signature line,\" Williams told Rolling Stone in 1988. \"He says he learned whenever soldiers in the field heard his sign-on line, they'd shout back at their radios.\" John Keating in Dead Poets Society Robin Williams as John Keating in 1989's 'Dead Poets Society'. Touchstone Pictures/Getty The warmth and force of Williams' comic energy separates the 1989 coming-of-age drama Dead Poets Society from other films in the \"inspirational teacher\" sub-genre, as his poetry-loving lecturer John Keating inspired a generation of students to stand up for their beliefs (and stand on their desks). Williams earned his second Best Actor nomination, while the film received a total of four Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, with writer Tom Schulman winning Best Original Screenplay. Ethan Hawke, who found his breakout role playing student Todd Anderson, later said that working with Williams on the film was a formative experience in his career. \"He gave me the first taste of what acting could be,\" Hawke told journalist Willie Geist on Sunday Today in 2018. \"When it goes really well, you disappear and you're in service of a larger story.\" Peter Pan in Hook Robin Williams as Peter Pan in 1991's 'Hook'. Murray Close/Sygma via Getty He worked with director Steven Spielberg in 1991's Hook, which was one of the biggest box office hits of Williams' career. He played Peter Banning, a workaholic lawyer and father of two who has forgotten that he's Peter Pan. When Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman) kidnaps his children, he must return to Neverland and save them. Even as he approached middle age, Williams delighted in letting out his inner teenager, making him the perfect choice to play the adult version of the boy who refused to grow up. After Williams' death, Raushan Hammond, who played the smiling Lost Boy Thud Butt, said that Williams \"really was truly Peter Pan.\" \"His energy level alone. I never saw him down or even tired,\" Hammond told PEOPLE in 2014. \"The role really fit him.\" Genie in Aladdin Genie (left, voiced by Robin Williams) and Aladdin in 1992's 'Aladdin'. Moviestore/Shutterstock For a generation of '90s kids, the Disney animated film marked one of Williams' most definitive performances. The actor's physical form matched the energy of his voice as the effervescent genie in 1992's Aladdin. He improvised much of his dialogue in the Oscar-winning fairy tale, and then the animators and editors worked to shape it into the story, according to Variety. Before Aladdin, it was rare for movie stars to lend their voices to animated films, but Williams started a trend that continues to this day. Scott Weinger, who voiced the title character, told PEOPLE the first time he met Williams. \"We were introduced, and they said, 'This is Scott, he's Aladdin.' And he shook my hand and he said, 'I'll be your genie,' \" Weinger said in 2024. \"Which I thought was very cool.\" Related Stories Robin Williams' Son Zak Shares Poignant Message on the Late Actor's 74th Birthday: 'Love You Forever' Robin Williams' Friends Remember the Comedy Legend 10 Years After His Death: 'He Was an Experience' (Exclusive) Daniel Hillard in Mrs. Doubtfire From left: Matthew Lawrence as Chris Hillard, Lisa Jakub as Lydia Hillard, Robin Williams as Mrs. Doubtfire, Mara Wilson as Natalie Hillard and Sally Field as Miranda Hillard in 1993's 'Mrs. Doubtfire'. Snap/Shutterstock Williams underwent a physical transformation for Mrs. Doubtfire, playing both the titular character and Daniel Hillard, a father who disguises himself as a female British housekeeper to secretly stay close to his children after he and his ex-wife (Sally Field) get divorced, unbeknownst to her, of course. Even under a foam suit, wig and prosthetic mask that altogether took five hours to apply, Williams' personality was on full display. He helped Mrs. Doubtfire become the second-highest-grossing film of 1993, according to Business Insider. After Williams' death, the San Francisco house featured as the family's home in the film became a makeshift location for tributes to the actor. Fans left flowers, photos and messages carved into a tree outside the home, according to former owner Douglas Ousterhout. \"The big thing is that this is a place for people to pay respect to Robin Williams, and I don't know how the house became that, but I'm glad it did,\" Ousterhout said in the 2024 documentary The House From ..., which explores famous homes featured in movies and TV shows. Alan Parrish in Jumanji From left: Bonnie Hunt as Sarah Whittle, Bradley Pierce as Peter Shepherd, Kirsten Dunst as Judy Shepherd and Robin Williams as Alan Parrish in 1995's 'Jumanji'. TriStar/Getty Williams continued his streak of blockbuster family films with 1995's Jumanji, a fantasy adventure based on Chris Van Allsburg's 1981 picture book. Williams played the adult Alan Parrish. Alan was transported into a magical board game when he was in middle school and grew up living in a magical jungle, trapped until someone rolled the dice on a five or an eight. He's finally freed 26 years later, along with a bunch of dangerous animals who run wild in his Brantford, N.H., hometown. Kirsten Dunst, then 13 years old, played Judy Shepherd, a girl who helps free Alan. In 2024, the actress revealed Williams gifted her a computer as a production wrap gift. \"It was an Apple, the ones that came in all those different colors,\" Dunst told Variety of the computer. \"He was like the most generous, kind, funny person.\" Armand Goldman in The Birdcage Robin Williams as Armand Goldman in 1996's 'The Birdcage'. Frank Trapper/Corbis via Getty Williams' love of camp made him stand out among his comedic peers, and playing Armand opposite Nathan Lane's Albert presented the opportunity to indulge his wilder instincts in the 1996 comedy The Birdcage. Williams and Lane portray a gay couple who pretend to be straight to win over their son's (Dan Futterman) fianc\u00e9e's (Calista Flockhart) conservative parents (Gene Hackman and Dianne Wiest). Lane described making the film as \"an extremely happy experience.\" \"He [director Mike Nichols] put together an extremely nice group of people who were also very, very talented and led by Robin, who was the dearest and sweetest guy in the world, and so talented,\" Lane told PEOPLE of Williams in 2024, adding, \"He was incredibly generous to me.\" Sean Maguire in Good Will Hunting Matt Damon (left) as Will Hunting and Robin Williams as Sean Maguire in 1997's 'Good Will Hunting'. Miramax/Kobal/Shutterstock After earning three nominations, Williams took home the golden statuette in 1998 for playing Sean Maguire, a quiet therapist who helps Matt Damon's titular troubled genius overcome his insecurities, in Good Will Hunting. As the dispenser of wisdom that was both obvious (\"It's not your fault\") and uncomfortable (\"I can't learn anything from you I couldn't read in some book\"), Williams proved to be the perfect mentor in the 1997 drama, costarring and co-written by BFFs and collaborators Ben Affleck and Damon. In a 2024 interview with Jake Hamilton of Jake's Takes, Damon recalled being amazed by Williams' acting abilities while they filmed the famous \"It's not your fault\" monologue. \"Robin was off-book in pre-production, which was nuts, because that monologue was like two pages long, and I don't say anything in that scene \u2014 just at the very top \u2014 and then he goes into that thing,\" the screenwriter-actor said of filming the scene. Damon added, \"I remember rehearsing it with him, and I was off book because we wrote it, but he just put his script down ... and Ben and I kind of looked at each other like, 'This is going to be amazing.' \" Walter Finch in Insomnia Robin Williams as Walter Finch in 2002's 'Insomnia'. Warner Brothers/Getty In 2002, Williams challenged himself with some of the darkest films of his career, taking on sinister roles that played against type. One of them was as serial killer Walter Finch in director Christopher Nolan's thriller Insomnia. Al Pacino plays Will Dormer, a detective in Alaska, trying to catch Finch while suffering from crippling insomnia exacerbated by the arctic town's perpetual daylight. The film showed a side of Williams that audiences had never seen before. \"I wasn't interested in any kind of inversion of his comic persona, some kind of manic villain,\" Nolan told the BBC at the time about directing Williams. \"What I wanted him to do, and what he was excited to do, was to play a character the likes of someone he's never played before \u2014 an unexceptional character.\" Nolan continued, \"He's [character Walter] a guy who, if he was sitting next to you on the bus, you wouldn't give a second glance. Robin's never done that before. He's played bad guys before, he's done dramatic roles, but he's never played somebody utterly ordinary.\" Sy Parrish in One Hour Photo Robin Williams as Seymour 'Sy' Parrish and Connie Nielsen as Nina Yorkin in 2002's 'One Hour Photo'. Moviestore/Shutterstock One Hour Photo is another memorable film from Williams' trip to the dark side in 2002. In the psychological thriller, he plays the mentally unstable Seymour \"Sy\" Parrish, a photo lab technician who becomes dangerously obsessed with a family whose pictures he develops. It's arguably the scariest performance of Williams' career, with the actor's usual warmth twisted into something disturbing. Williams changed his appearance more than usual for the role, bleaching his hair blond and wearing wire-framed glasses. \"The physical transformation \u2014 it kind of helped to feel the isolation and the loneliness of Sy,\" Williams told the BBC that year on how he got into character. \"And there have been times where my life was just isolated, and I drew on that as well.\" Theodore Roosevelt in Night at the Museum Ben Stiller (left) as Larry Daley and Robin Williams as Theodore Roosevelt in 2006's 'Night at the Museum'. Moviestore/Shutterstock The 2006 comedy Night at the Museum was the highest-grossing film of Williams' career, not adjusted for inflation, according to The Numbers. Ben Stiller stars as Larry, a night security guard who enters a fantasy world akin to the ones Williams explored in Jumanji and Hook. Williams steals the show in a supporting role as a wax figure of President Theodore \"Teddy\" Roosevelt that comes to life \u2014 along with every other exhibit in the Museum of Natural History. Williams reprised the role in two sequels, with the final film in the trilogy, 2014's Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb, becoming one of the last projects he worked on before his death. Stiller has credited Williams with being an important part of the franchise's success. \"I remember when the first movie happened, and Shawn [Levy, the director] said he wanted to ask Robin to play Teddy Roosevelt, and I was like, 'Oh my God, that's the most brilliant idea in the world. We can't do the movie if he doesn't say yes,' \" Stiller told PEOPLE at the premiere of Secret of the Tomb a few months after Williams' death. \"That's really how we always felt, so he's an integral part of this.\" Former costar Rami Malek also shared a memory of Williams on the set of the third installment and what he observed from the generational talent. \"We're shooting at the British Museum at night, and we have the place all to ourselves,\" Malek told host Jimmy Fallon during an appearance on The Tonight Show in 2021. \"And Robin \u2014 you could tell something was happening with him. He would go on these riffs every once in a while and light up the world, and you'd be like, 'Oh my God. Who are you?' And then dip back down into this other place.\" Malek continued, \"And so I see him veer off and he walks off alone, and he's just kind of staring at this massive rock in the British Museum. And I'm like, 'Oh, man. What's going on with him? Is he all right?' \" \"I walk up to kind of say, 'Is everything okay?' And he looks at me, just kind of slightly over the shoulder, and he goes, 'How often do you get to be alone with the Rosetta Stone?' \" Malek said of Williams marveling at the historic relic and being present in the moment.
