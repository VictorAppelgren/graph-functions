  "title": "I tried the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE, and it got big upgrades in several ways",
  "description": "The midrange phone sees improvements across all essential features while keeping its $649 price point.",
  "content": "Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\n\u2022 The Samsung S25 FE lineup has officially launched with a starting price of $649.\n\u2022 It features a better front camera, battery, and chipset, as well as a more compact form factor.\n\u2022 With holiday sale season on the horizon, you can expect discounts on the flagship phones soon, making the price difference less enticing.\n\nAs phones continue to get flashier features, more unique factors, powerful cameras, and more advanced processors capable of supporting the increasing need for on-device AI processing, prices also continuously become steeper. Luckily, for consumers who just want the essentials, budget phones exist, and Samsung just unveiled its newest lineup: the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE.\n\nAlso: The best Samsung phones to buy in 2025\n\nAt a glance, the S25 FE is almost indistinguishable from its flagship counterparts. It sports the same signature Galaxy aesthetic with a rectangular shape, rounded edges, a three-camera array on the back, and clean matte finishes. However, after holding it, the differences that make the $150 price gap a thing became apparent.\n\nAfter spending a morning with the S25 FE, here is a roundup of the new phone's biggest standouts and what you could expect if you make the switch.\n\nAt the January Unpacked event, Samsung launched its flagship S25 device lineup, and one of its biggest standouts was the plethora of AI features. Now, all of those same productivity and communication features are available in the FE version too, enabling you to experience the suite without shelling out the extra cash.\n\n\"Galaxy S25 FE plays an important role as a gateway into the broader Galaxy AI ecosystem, making these AI-powered\n\nexperiences more attainable for a broader range of users,\" said Jay Kim, EVP and Head of Customer Experience Office, Mobile eXperience Business at Samsung Electronics in the release.\n\nAlso: The secrets that made Pixel 10 Pro the world's smartest phone camera - from inside Google\n\nAs expected, many of the AI features benefit the camera and photo experience of the phone. In addition to Photo Assist, already available on last year's S24 FE, the new model features a Generative Edit feature, which detects photobombers in the background of your photos and suggests what to remove. Audio eraser allows you to adjust the volume of various sound elements in your videos, such as voices, wind, noises, and more. Meanwhile, the Auto Trim feature automatically slices your video to highlight the best moments.\n\nThe core of the new features is geared toward more personalized experiences in an attempt to market the offerings as a \"true AI companion.\" For example, users can now access their Now Brief, which gives them insights that summarize and anticipate their daily needs, such as surfacing navigation suggestions or schedule reminders.\n\nThe Now Bar on the lock screen also surfaces other tools and relevant information.\n\nPurchasing the S25 FE comes with six months of free access to Gemini Advanced, Google's premium AI plan, which retails for $20 per month. The plan's perks include Gemini in Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides, Deep Research, Canvas, and more.\n\nThe S25 FE got improved specs where it matters to deliver the most optimal performance. This starts with the inclusion of the Samsung in-house Exynos 2400 chipset, a step up from the S24 FE's Exynos 2400e. While the two chipsets sound nearly identical, the faster CPU clock speed of the S25 FE should, in theory, offer a performance boost.\n\nOf course, the Exynos chip won't compete with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite found on the pricier S25 models -- that's a sacrifice you'll be making by opting for the FE.\n\nOn a more positive note, the S25 FE features a larger 4,900mAh battery this year. This, paired with the 45W wired charging, should provide better endurance overall. We'll have to see for ourselves during the review.\n\nThe selfie camera has also been upgraded to a 12MP sensor that Samsung says should yield crisper and more vivid pictures. While that is the only camera upgrade on this year's FE model, the three-camera array on the back of the phone still consists of a versatile 12MP ultra-wide, 50MP wide, and 8MP telephoto. Paired with the AI features above, you can expect an improved photo-taking experience.\n\nRecently, there has been an influx of lighter and slimmer phone designs, as seen by the S25 Edge, and the S25 FE is the latest to join the trend. While it's not to the same degree of slimmness as the Edge model, a Samsung spokesperson tells me that the company took the Edge concept and carried it to the S25 FE.\n\nAlso: I've tested every single Galaxy S25 phone - and my favorite isn't the flagship model\n\nWeighing just 190g, the S25 FE is not only lighter than its predecessor, which weighed 213g, but also 0.6mm slimmer. The dimensions are fairly similar to the Galaxy S25 Plus, so if you like the look and feel of that device, you will enjoy this one.\n\nDespite the compactness, the display was not compromised. It still sports a 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display, the same size as that of the Galaxy S25 Plus, with up to a 120Hz refresh rate for a smooth browsing experience. Even in my limited time with the phone, the picture was not something to scoff at, with rich contrasts and vibrant colors, as seen in the Star Trek app visuals below.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 FE retails for $649 and can be purchased today from the Samsung website. It is available in Navy, Jetblack, White, and Icyblue. From my short time with the devices, Samsung seems to have delivered a solid phone with all the essentials, ideal for someone who isn't a power user and doesn't need the additional specs and performance boost that comes with pricier flagships.\n\nWhile you consider making the purchase, it is worth noting that the holiday season is on the horizon, which means sales galore. It is very likely that the flagship Galaxy S25 lineup becomes discounted, closing the gap between those models and the S25 FE. However, this isn't guaranteed and will require some patience, so if you just want a phone without all the bells and whistles, the S25 FE may be a more sensible pickup today.",

The recently announced Galaxy Z series, consisting of the Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, rounds out the brand's summer releases. Put simply, you really can't go wrong with any of the phones Samsung has launched this year.\nBut, like any other range of phones, Samsung has a phone for every pocket and every budget. If you need a good everyday phone, Samsung has the Galaxy S25. If you want something compact, Samsung has the Galaxy Z Flip 7. If you want something durable, Samsung has those as well. We have tested them all, so here are our picks for the best Samsung phones you can buy today.\nWhat is the best Samsung phone right now?\nAfter extensively testing the latest phones on the market, I've found that the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is the best Samsung phone right now, with the company's top-of-the-line features and specifications, including an S Pen stylus for precision inputs, a 200MP camera system, and the most durable display on any Galaxy phone yet. The size and abundance of features of the S25 Ultra may almost be overwhelming for some users, but you certainly get what you pay for, with its starting price of $1,299.\nOur runner-ups on this list are just as noteworthy. The smaller Galaxy S25 Plus variant is nearly as capable as the Ultra model but costs at least $300 less. You'll lose the S Pen and 200MP camera but retain most of the software AI features and AMOLED display. For something more experiential, consider the Galaxy Z Flip 7, which flips and folds into a pocketable square and is accessibly priced.\nAlso: The best Android phones to buy in 2025\nThe best Samsung phones in 2025\nWhy we like it: The Galaxy S25 Ultra stands out as the premier handset in Samsung's lineup, largely thanks to its robust Galaxy AI capabilities and far-reaching hardware features. The latest Galaxy AI suite brings practical and useful features like real-time call translation, voice commands that work across multiple apps, and photo editing capabilities. My real-world testing suggests these AI functions surpass those on competing Android devices in speed, consistency, and overall usefulness.\nBeyond the AI, the phone has impressed us with its large 6.9-inch, anti-reflective, AMOLED display and a reliable 5,000mAh battery. It helps that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, 12GB of RAM, and improved vapor cooling chamber all contribute to a more power-efficient experience. Durability is another key strength you should be aware of, owing to its lightweight titanium frame and resilient Corning Gorilla Armor 2 glass. Sure, you'll see some microscratches from everyday use, but cracking the Ultra model is harder than ever.\nFurthermore, the camera system is significantly upgraded with a 50MP ultrawide lens that captures landscape and macro shots with greater detail and vibrancy. We've run several camera tests between the S25 Ultra and competing phones like the iPhone 16 Pro Max and Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, and found the Samsung model to deliver the sharpest and vibrant imagery.\nReview: Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\nWho it's for: The Galaxy S25 Ultra is primarily targeted toward users who demand the best smartphone experience Samsung can provide and are keen to explore the latest consumer-facing AI features. It represents a particularly compelling upgrade for individuals holding onto three to four-year-old devices, offering significant advancements across the board.\nThe durable build makes it an excellent choice for those who prioritize drop protection and longevity. Multimedia enthusiasts will appreciate the large, anti-reflective, 6.9-inch screen combined with enhanced cooling for smooth gaming and movie playback. Additionally, photography lovers looking for improved detail and color in wide-angle and close-up macro shots will find the new 50MP ultrawide camera valuable.\nWho should look elsewhere: Despite its strengths, the Galaxy S25 Ultra isn't my top choice for everyone. Its $1,299 price point puts it out of reach for budget-conscious consumers, and users who frequently utilize the S Pen's Bluetooth gestures for actions like remotely triggering the camera may be disappointed, as the functionality has been removed.\nFurthermore, individuals who prefer a less angular or \"boxy\" phone design might find the standard Galaxy S25 Plus or S25 Edge models more aesthetically pleasing and comfortable to hold. If you don't require the absolute pinnacle of performance, the largest possible screen, or the most advanced camera system Samsung offers, the more affordable S25 Plus and S25 Edge provide many similar core features and represent better value.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Display size: 6.9 inches | Storage options: Up to 1TB | Rear cameras: 200MP main, 50MP ultrawide, 50MP telephoto with 5x zoom, 10MP telephoto with 3x zoom | Front camera: 12MP | Battery: 5,000mAh | Price: Starting at $1,299\nWhy we like it: There is something about a small phone with flagship specs that gets our juices flowing. Not many phone makers produce flagship phones with 6.2-inch (or smaller) screens. They're attractive because they're more comfortable to use one-handed without compromising on specifications. Sure, the battery is smaller -- it has to be, but beyond that, the Galaxy S25 is a powerful phone that checks all the right boxes.\nWith the S25 serving as the base model for the lineup that also includes the S25 Plus and the S25 Ultra, it rounds out a selection of phones of all sizes, sharing the same specifications throughout the lineup. So you're not missing out on anything by choosing the smallest (and least expensive) flagship in Samsung's arsenal.\nReview: Samsung Galaxy S25\nWho it's for: Small phone fans can rejoice that this puny pocket powerhouse is available for those who want all the power and performance of a flagship phone, but don't want to carry around a small airplane runway in their skinny jeans. People with frequent access to electricity will also be fans. The 4,000mAh battery can last a day with light to medium usage, but it can definitely survive a day if you can drop it on a charger while you work, for example.\nAnother set of users who will want to use this phone -- or any other phone in this list -- are Samsung ecosystem customers. Samsung has tablets, laptops, and wearables that all work better with a Samsung phone in your pocket, so the S25 would be a good option for those who already have a Galaxy Watch 8, Galaxy Ring, or Galaxy Tab S10 FE.\nWho should look elsewhere: Battery life is the chief concern with this phone. During my testing, I found that the phone can last a day, even with medium to heavy usage away from Wi-Fi, but only just. That's fine, but in this day and age, flagship phones will usually last for a day and a half, meaning if you forget to plug in your phone overnight, you can wake up and make it to work before you'll need to charge again. That's not the case here.\nThe Galaxy S25 also doesn't have the S25 Ultra's camera chops. The S25 Ultra has larger and better camera sensors for all three cameras (and adds an extra telephoto besides). So if you're looking for absolutely top-notch photography, this phone isn't the one for you.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Display size: 6.2 inches | Storage options: Up to 1TB | Rear cameras: 50MP main, 12MP ultrawide, and 10MP telephoto (3x) | Front camera: 12MP | Battery: 4,000mAh | Price: Starting at $799\nWhy we like it: The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the best foldable phone going into the rest of 2025, thanks to its ultra-thin form factor and market-leading camera system, which captures more lifelike images than competing models from OnePlus and Google, based on our tests.\nSamsung took the traditional smartphone route when refining the outer display of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, opting for a wider, more regular aspect ratio panel than last year's narrower Galaxy Z Fold 6. That makes a notable difference in hand-feel and ergonomics, even though the two phones are only $100 apart. Compared to the standard slab-style phone, you're simply getting more screen with the Z Fold 7, with a larger 8-inch display when unfolded. For reference, most modern-day phones range from 6 to 6.8 inches.\nNaturally, all the content I've been consuming on the phone, like video streaming, social media feeds, and Google Maps, is portrayed in a highly consumable manner; nothing feels disorienting or cropped out. While the foldable doesn't match its Ultra sibling spec-for-spec, the Z Fold 7 truly shines and more than makes up for the \"inferior\" 200MP camera system in long exposure shots and selfies, thanks to its self-standing nature.\nReview: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7\nWho it's for: I often recommend the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold over other foldables because of Samsung's feature-rich approach to software. Running on the OneUI launcher (over Android 16) means you can expect a simple yet customizable user interface, with support for up to seven years of operating system and security updates. I can't say the same for the OnePlus Open or Motorola Razr.\nThis ultra-slim form factor is also ideal for multitaskers and other users who want to see as much information at once as possible without reaching for a tablet or laptop. You simply won't find a foldable with better ergonomics right now than this.\nWho should look elsewhere: With a starting price tag of $1,999, you're mostly paying for the innovation factor with this phone. So if you're more interested in a safe and reliable handset that's arguably much easier to repair, then I'd recommend a traditional slab phone like the Samsung Galaxy S25 series instead.\nUsers shopping for a foldable phone should consider the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold if they prefer a handset with less bloatware and a stubbier design, or last year's Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 if they want S Pen stylus support, which the Z Fold 7 omits.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 tech specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite | Display sizes: 6.5-inch exterior and 8-inch interior | Storage options: 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB | Rear cameras: 200MP wide, 12MP ultrawide, 10MP telephoto | Front cameras: 10MP front | Battery: 4,400mAh | Price: Starting at $1,999\nWhy we like it: While the Z Fold 7 might be Samsung's most advanced phone, the S25 Edge is arguably the runner-up, flaunting an ultra-thin form factor that gives it the benefit of having a large 6.7-inch AMOLED display and a lightweight hand feel. I've been testing the phone for a little more than a week, and it still blows my mind how this design combination exists in 2025. Picking up almost any other big-screen phone is like taking a step back in time.\nWhile the S25 Edge is the first of its kind, it features the best aspects of the standard Galaxy S25 models, including the tried-and-tested 200MP main camera of the Ultra, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset with 12GB of RAM, and a display that gets brighter than most phones when outdoors. Based on my review, the lack of a dedicated telephoto lens on the S25 Edge wasn't sorely missed, as the main sensor retained a good amount of detail even after digitally cropping.\nReview: Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge\nWho it's for: Tech enthusiasts and users with delicate wrists (myself included) will benefit from the ultra-thin design of the S25 Edge. It really is one of those phones you have to see and hold to truly grasp its extraordinance. And once you use it, every other device will feel like a brick in your hand.\nYou'll also have to be willing to splurge a bit, as the S25 Edge starts at $1,099 for the 256GB variant. That puts it right in between the S25 Plus ($999) and S25 Ultra ($1,299), both of which field larger batteries and more cameras. Should you find a competitive trade-in offer at a retailer or carrier store, then the S25 Edge and its unique design may be worth considering.\nWho should look elsewhere: While the price of the S25 Edge is one barrier to entry, I'd put it after the most significant caveat, which is battery life. With only a 3,900mAh capacity -- smaller than the standard Galaxy S25's 4,000mAh) -- you should expect to charge the S25 Edge by late afternoon. As a power user, I often found myself topping up the phone before the end of my work shifts, which is not the most ideal if you're a frequent traveler or don't often have a charger nearby.\nTherefore, if endurance is a priority for you, I'd recommend the S25 Plus (4,900mAh) or Ultra (5,000mAh) models instead. If you're not a fan of Samsung's OneUI software, often criticized for having too many features and apps, it may also be worthwhile to wait for Apple's rumored iPhone 17 Air, another thin phone that runs on iOS instead.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Display size: 6.7 inches | Storage options: Up to 512GB | Rear cameras: 200MP main and 50MP ultrawide | Front camera: 12MP | Battery: 3,900mAh | Price: Starting at $1,099\nWhy we like it: The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 is one of the best flip phones you can buy in the US. It has exceptional build quality and the largest cover screen at the time of its launch. It's paired with two excellent cameras on the outside, which, along with the Flex hinge, make it a great device for creators. You can take some fabulous shots with the phone serving as its own tripod and using gesture controls.\nThe phone is hampered by its software, though. You can run most apps on the cover screen, but you have to jump through a few hoops to get there. Once you do, you don't even have to open the phone for a lot of tasks.\nThat adds to the idea of the Flip 7 being one of the most compact phones you can buy -- it fits nicely into a small handbag or the breast pocket of a shirt or jacket. Samsung also enabled Samsung Dex for the first time on the Flip, which allows you to hook up an external display and get a more desktop-like app experience, which is great for productivity.\nReview: Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7\nWho it's for: The appeal of a compact flagship is a popular one, and the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 qualifies. Most apps run really well on the cover screen, including maps, YouTube, messaging apps, email, and more. People who like Samsung's keyboard will also feel at home since that's the only option when using the cover display.\nIt also appeals to people looking to get into foldables without splashing the cash needed for a book-style foldable. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 starts at $1,099, which is expensive but no more pricey than other flagships.\nWho should look elsewhere: Right off the bat, owners of a Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 won't find much of a reason to upgrade here. The cameras are very similar to last year's. The cover screen is large but still hobbled by suboptimal software, to put it frankly. It keeps you in a curated, Samsung-approved experience rather than allowing you to do what you want to do.\nThose looking for raw power may also want to go elsewhere. Samsung went with its own Exynos 2500 processor rather than Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite. The day-to-day experience isn't noticeably worse, but if you're a gamer or need to export a lot of larger, 4K videos, you'll notice the difference.\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 tech specs: Processor: Exynos 2500 | Display sizes: 4.1-inch external display and 6.9-inch internal display | RAM/Storage: 12GB with 256GB or 512TB | Battery: 4,300mAh | Camera: 50MP wide, 12MP ultrawide, and 10MP front | Price: Starting at $1,099\nWhy we like it: For those prioritizing excellent value -- getting the most \"bang for your buck\" -- the Galaxy A36 5G presents a compelling case, potentially steering buyers away from the pricier S and Z series. There are three standout reasons why this device arguably surpasses other sub-$400 options: it boasts a fantastic 6.7-inch AMOLED display that smoothly ramps up to a 120Hz refresh rate, features a versatile triple-camera system headlined by a 50MP main sensor, and includes a 5,000mAh battery that lasted me well into the night.\nWith the A36 5G, Samsung focused on the features users value most at this price point. Compared older A-series devices, this model offers tangible upgrades like a more premium glass backing, a higher-performing Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset with 8GB of RAM, and enhancements to the camera system. Crucially, its inclusion in Samsung's five-year software and security update commitment offers longevity rarely matched by competitors in this price bracket.\nReview: Samsung Galaxy A36 5G\nWho it's for: The Galaxy A36 5G is primarily targeted toward value-conscious consumers seeking a highly capable smartphone under the $400 mark. Its combination of a high-quality 120Hz AMOLED screen, a respectable 50MP main camera, and a large 5,000mAh battery addresses the core features many users look for in a reliable daily driver. I recommend the Samsung phone to most people who want a little more power and performance than traditional budget handsets.\nThe A36 5G is also an excellent choice for individuals who value long-term usability and security. The five-year update commitment provides peace of mind and considerably extends the device's lifespan compared to rivals like Motorola and OnePlus.\nWho should look elsewhere: While the A36 5G excels in value, it may not satisfy users seeking specific niche features or aesthetics found in some competitors. Those prioritizing a particularly unique or \"exciting\" design language might find alternatives like the Nothing Phone 3a more visually appealing.\nFurthermore, if rapid charging speed is a necessity, other devices could be a better fit; the OnePlus 13R, for example, supports up to 80W wired charging (compared to Samsung's 25W). Another alternative, the Google Pixel 9a, offers a more user-friendly software experience, with less bloatware (read: preinstalled applications and services) than the Samsung.\nSamsung Galaxy A36 5G tech specs: Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 | Display: 6.7 inches| RAM/Storage: 8GB/128GB | Cameras: 50MP wide, 8MP ultrawide, 5MP macro, and 12MP front-facing camera | Battery: 5,000mAh | Price: Starting at $399\nWhy we like it: The Galaxy A16 5G brings desirable features like 5G connectivity and a large 5,000mAh battery to an impressively low $200 price point. This makes it a compelling option for consumers focused on value and essential capabilities.\nFor its budget price, the A16 5G includes some of the better specs I've seen in this range, including a sizable 6.7-inch 90Hz AMOLED display, expandable storage up to 1TB, a capable 50MP main camera for day-to-day shots, and four years of security updates. My hands-on testing found the phone surprisingly sturdy to manage, with a smooth display that's great for browsing and watching shows.\nAlso: The best cheap phones ZDNET's tested\nWho it's for: The Galaxy A16 5G is ideal for budget-conscious buyers prioritizing long battery life, 5G access, and the flexibility of expandable storage without a high cost. It's for those seeking reliable essentials, including students, children, elders, and casual users.\nIt also suits those who want a better-than-average 90Hz AMOLED display -- most phones in this price range have 60Hz displays for more stuttery animations -- and a decent camera for everyday use, backed by long-term software support.\nWho should look elsewhere: I always remind readers that expectations should align with the price; the A16 5G lacks the premium feel and top-tier performance of flagships, and that's to be expected. Users needing a device that can handle more strenuous tasks like video editing and high-graphics gaming should consider spending more for a midrange or flagship phone.\nSerious mobile photographers will also find the camera system basic. As an alternative, I'd highly recommend the Google Pixel 8a, which offers a more reliable software and camera experience.\nSamsung Galaxy A16 5G tech specs: Processor: MediaTek Dimensity 6300 | Display: 6.7 inches | RAM/Storage: 4GB/128GB | Cameras: 50MP wide, 5MP wide, 2MP macro, and 13MP front-facing camera | Battery: 5,000mAh | Price: Starting at $199\nWhat is the best Samsung phone?\nWhile the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra sits at the top of this year's ranking list (for now), here's a wider scope of ZDNET's best picks and their respective feature sets.\nSamsung phone | Price | Display | Cameras | Battery |\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra | $1,299 | 6.9 inches | 200MP wide, 50MP with 5x optical, 10MP with 3x optical, and 50MP ultrawide, 12MP front-facing camera | 5,000mAh |\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Plus | $999 | 6.7 inches | 50MP wide, 10MP with 3x optical, and 12MP ultrawide, 12MP front-facing camera | 4,900mAh |\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 | $1,999 | 8 inches (interior) | 200MP wide, 10MP with 3x optical, and 12MP ultrawide, 10MP cover screen and main screen selfie | 4,400mAh |\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge | $1,099 | 6.7 inches | 200MP wide, 50MP ultrawide, 12MP front-facing camera | 3,900mAh |\nSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 | $1,099 | 6.9 inches (interior) | 50MP wide, 12MP ultrawide, 10MP front-facing camera | 4,300mAh |\nSamsung Galaxy A36 5G | $399 | 6.7 inches | 50MP wide, 8MP ultrawide, 5MP macro, and 32MP front-facing camera | 5,000mAh |\nSamsung Galaxy A16 5G | $199 | 6.7 inches | 50MP wide, 5MP ultrawide, 2MP macro, and 13MP front-facing camera | 5,000mAh |\nWhy choose a Samsung as your smartphone of choice?\nWhile previous comparisons have placed Apple ahead of Samsung regarding the overall phone experience, Samsung is arguably the best option in 2025. One reason is the variety of models across different price points, from the A-series that encapsulates the sub-$500 market to the S-series for premium shoppers. Having tested the latest handsets from both brands (and others), I find that the Samsung Galaxy continues to offer the most features and capabilities at relatively competitive prices.\nWhen compared to the Google Pixel lineup specifically, Samsung wins out by having a more robust software experience, with greater customizability for users to modify settings, home screen setups, app behaviors, and more. Historically, Google has leaned on Samsung to debut the latest software features, such as Circle to Search and enhanced Gemini, so you can count on Galaxy phones to field more innovative capabilities sooner.\nOverall, the popularity of Samsung is a key asset to the brand, as there's a greater variety of cases and accessories, as well as more certified repair technicians for after-sales support.\nWhich Samsung phone is right for you?\nFactors to consider when choosing a Samsung phone\nZDNET writers like myself spent months testing every phone in this best list while also sourcing opinions and recommendations from industry experts and analysts who have also tested the devices. Here are the key factors that we look for when curating the top picks.\n- Design: Unlike how we would compare the best Android phones, comparing Samsung phones across different price points mostly boils down to the hardware. How a phone is designed, what materials the manufacturer chooses, and whether the device can take a hit or two are considered when picking the very best.\n- Cameras: The camera systems on Samsung phones have gotten superb over the past few years, so much so that you're well off even if you opt for a mid-ranger like the Galaxy A36 5G.\n- Special features: If there's one thing that differentiates most Samsung phones from other manufacturers, it's unique features. From the S25 Ultra with its built-in stylus and 200MP camera to the foldable screens of the Z Fold and Z Flip, you'll feel a sense of wonderment when using something that's built differently.\n- Availability: Samsung has a reputation for bringing the wildest phones to the press, even if they're not readily available. That's why every pick on this list can be purchased at the time of writing, whether that's on Samsung's website or at a local carrier store.\nHow we test Samsung phones\nZDNET's review team spends upwards of a year testing the ins and outs of every Samsung model, evaluating the day-to-day performance, camera quality, battery life and endurance, and more. Here's a breakdown of every factor we consider before we make recommendations:\n- Design and ergonomics: How good a phone looks and feels plays a big role in many users' buying journeys, so we consider these aspects heavily when testing.\n- Performance: Several factors affect a phone's performance, including LTE/5G signal, battery life, and background tasks. Therefore, we typically begin our evaluations with a fully charged handset, all background tasks closed, and the most stable mobile connection possible.\n- Camera quality: ZDNET tests phone cameras by capturing hundreds of photos and videos of various subjects and in various lighting conditions. We also compare the output to that of older models.\n- Battery life and charging: It's also important for us to evaluate how long phones last under light, moderate, and heavy usage, how long they take to recharge, and how they do it (wired, wireless, or both).\n- Special features: These features distinguish tested devices from a bustling smartphone market and hopefully bring added value to users, not the opposite.\n- Pricing and availability: Beyond budget considerations, we also note if a phone is available in the US or only internationally.\nFor a more extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensive phone testing methodology page.\nLatest news on Samsung phones\nThe latest event for Samsung was July Unpacked, where it announced the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Z Fold 7 devices to the public. Now, all eyes are on its rumored tri-foldable phone, which the company first teased back in January, when it suggested that there were several untapped form factors the company was exploring.\nMore recently, Samsung's Head of Mobile Experience, TM Roh, told The Korea Times that the company is gearing up to launch a tri-foldable phone by the end of the year. If true, we may see an upcoming foldable phone that bends in two ways, with a display that surpasses even the Z Fold 7 in ingenuity.\nWhile Samsung wouldn't be the first to do it -- the Huawei Mate XT Ultimate gets that honor -- it could be the first to launch a phone of such nature in the broader international market, including the US.\nKerry Wan's smartphone advice\nI've used dozens of smartphones in the past year alone, learning the ins and outs -- the tips and tricks -- to make the most out of my handset. Here are my three biggest pointers on taking care of your smartphone in 2025:\nSpeeding up your smartphone\nSomething I always do when setting up a new Android phone is dialing up animation and transition speeds. You can do this by turning on Developer Options, a backend catalog of system settings meant for developers to access (rules were meant to be broken, right?).\nTo turn on Developer Options, go into your About Phone page in the settings and look for the Build Number. Tap on that seven times, and you should see a pop-up indicating that Developer Options has been turned on. Now, the activated tab will appear in the main settings list. From there, scroll down until you find Windows, Transition, and Animator duration scale. Tap into each and switch from 1x (default) to 0.5x to double the speed of your phone's animations.\nOptimizing your battery health\nTo preserve your phone's battery life, it's best to charge it between 20% and 80% and never let it drop to 0% or charge fully to 100%. This is because the heat generated from overcharging the phone can burn (or degrade) the battery, reducing its number of charge cycles. This phenomenon is the reason why you shouldn't charge your phone overnight or leave it plugged in for an extended period of time.\nWhen in doubt, after a year or two of usage, consider getting your phone's battery swapped to refresh its charge cycles. You'll be amazed at how well it functions again.\nHow to keep your phone clean\nUnless you're invested in a repairs and warranty plan like Samsung Care, consider suiting your phone with a protective case and/or tempered glass screen protector. Beyond drop protection, the two accessories will prevent the phone from getting scratches, scuffs, and other blemishes and can greatly reduce the chance of water damage. For what it's worth, if a manufacturer claims its phone is rated IP68, that means the device can withstand dust ingress and be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes at 1 meter.\nAlso: Best satellite phones: Models tested from SpaceX, Garmin, & More\nFAQ on smartphones in 2025\nWhich Samsung phones will get Android 15?\nThe latest version of Android, Android 15, is coming the latest Samsung Galaxy phones, starting with the Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7. Compatible models include Galaxy S series (S21 or newer), Galaxy Z series (Z Flip 3 or newer), Galaxy A series (A14 or newer), Galaxy F series (F15 or newer), Galaxy M series (M15 or newer), and Galaxy Tab series (Tab S8 or newer).\nWhat Samsung models support the One UI 8 update?\nSamsung's One UI 8 has officially launched, starting with the latest Galaxy S25 series of smartphones. It's expected to come to older models, too, including the Galaxy S21 series and newer, Z Flip and Fold 3 series and newer, and A16 series and newer. Select M and F series smartphones will also receive the One UI 8 update.\nWhich is best, Samsung Galaxy A or S?\nWhile the A and S series of Samsung Galaxy phones cater to two different customers, there is an overlap in features and designs making both models worthy of consideration.\nYou should buy the A series if...\n- You want a great-value smartphone that won't break the bank (less than $500).\n- There's a generous installment plan or sign-on offer from your carrier.\nYou should buy the S series if...\n- You want the most premium smartphone experience that Samsung offers and don't mind paying for it.\n- You value innovation and/or having the best display and camera performance.\nWhat is the newest Samsung phone?\nThe newest Samsung phones are the Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, both of which launched during the company's July Unpacked event, and feature foldable designs that balance flagship mobile performance with portable form factors.\nWhich Samsung phone has the best camera?\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra has the best camera of any Samsung phone and one of the best overall cameras on the market. It features a 200MP main camera along with four accompanying cameras, allowing it to take extremely high-quality shots, including close-up images and ultrawide photos. The S25 Ultra can also video record in up to 8K UHD quality at 30fps, making it one of the most capable phone cameras money can buy.\nIs the Samsung S23 worth buying?\nTwo years later, the Samsung Galaxy S23 is still worth buying. Compared to 2024 and 2025 S series phones, the previous generation mainly falls short on Galaxy AI features and camera performance. Even then, for a now depreciated selling price, the Galaxy S23 covers a good 80% of the S25 experience. That makes it the perfect alternative to the latest Samsung phones, even if they're now two years older.\nDoes Samsung have the best Android phone?\nThe ZDNET team ran extensive tests on the top Android phones in 2025, and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra took the top spot, with one of the sharpest and most color-accurate displays on the market, ample amount of RAM and storage, and an exceptional camera system that's reliable even in dimmer environments.\nLatest updates\n- August 2025: After testing and consideration, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 has earned a spot as \"Best compact Samsung phone.\"\n- July 2025: The ZDNET team has wrapped up testing the new Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, and has replaced the Z Fold 6 for \"Best Samsung foldable phone.\" The Galaxy A35 5G was also replaced with the Galaxy A36 5G.\n- June 2025: Added new information about Samsung's upcoming foldable phones, as confirmed by the company, as well as details on OneUI 8 (based on Android 16) support.\n- May 2025: The Galaxy Z Flip 6 has been replaced with the new Galaxy S25 Edge, with the honor of being the best lightweight Samsung phone. Information regarding Samsung's rumored tri-foldable phone has also been added.\n- April 2025: We added information regarding what Samsung phones users can expect later this year, including the Galaxy S25 Edge, Z Flip 7, and Z Fold 7.\n- March 2025: We updated the information regarding Samsung's OneUI 7 updates, as they're officially rolling out to older models.\n- February 2025: We named the Galaxy S25 Ultra and S25 Plus as \"Best Samsung phone overall\" and \"Best Samsung phone for most people\" respectively, taking the place of last year's S24 models.\nOther Samsung phones we tested\nBe sure to check out ZDNET's comparisons of the best phones and Android phones available. I've also listed the top Samsung picks that didn't make our list for your further consideration.\nWhile the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 is a flip phone contender in 2025, the Motorola Razr Ultra is a worthy alternative, with a greater variety of colors and finishes, and a more functional outer screen.\nMotorola also has a cleaner (closer to stock Android) software experience, making it an enticing option for minimalists and users who prefer less bloatware.\nBesides the Z Flip 7, the Galaxy S25, with its 6.2-inch display, can be considered one of the best compact Samsung phones available right now.\nIt doesn't flip or fold, but the Galaxy S25 still packs a 4,000mAh battery, a more capable Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, and enough RAM to power its suite of Galaxy AI features.\nIf you're looking for a modern Samsung phone that can handle drops, bumps, and harsh environments, consider the XCover7 model, which features a large screen and rugged build.\nFor more information on Samsung phones, as well as tips and tricks, check out how changing these settings on your Samsung phone can improve your experience, and the preinstalled apps you should delete from your Samsung phone immediately."

      "text": "The secrets that make Pixel 10 Pro the world's smartest phone camera - from inside Google\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- In a deep dive interview, a Google leader on the Pixel Camera team pulled back the curtain and how the company used AI to launch new camera features that other phones don't have.\n- We learned what makes Pro Res Zoom, Auto Best Take, Conversational Editing and other software features work.\n- As the only one of the companies making frontier AI models that also makes a smartphone, Google has a key advantage over every other smartphone maker.\nIsaac Reynolds has been working on the Pixel Camera team at Google for almost a decade -- since the first Google Pixel phone launched in 2016. And yet, I think it's fair to say that the Group Product Manager of Pixel Camera has never been more bullish about the technology that Google has integrated into a phone camera than he is with this year's Pixel 10 Pro. A new wave of AI breakthroughs in the past year have allowed Google to use Large Language Models, machine learning, and generative AI imaging to unlock new capabilities that have powered another meaningful leap forward in phone photography.\nI got the chance to sit down with Reynolds while he was still catching his breath after the launch of the Pixel 10 phones -- and at the same time, ramping up for the next set of camera upgrades the team is preparing for Google's 2026 smartphones.\nAlso: Pixel just zoomed ahead of iPhone in the camera photography race\nI peppered Reynolds with all of my burning questions about Pro Res Zoom, Conversational Editing, Camera Coach, AI models, the Tensor G5 chip, Auto Best Take and the larger ambitions of the Pixel Camera team. At the same time, he challenged me with information I didn't expect on Telephoto Panoramas, C2PA AI metadata, Guided Frame, and educating the public about AI.\nI got to unpack a lot about how the Google team was able to engineer such big advances in the Pixel 10 Pro camera system, and we delved far deeper into the new photography features than Google talked about in its 2025 Made by Google event or in its published blog post.\nHere's my reporter's notebook on what I learned.\nMission of the Pixel Camera team\n\"I think the major thing our team has always been focused on is what I call durable [photography] problems -- low light, zoom, dynamic range, and detail,\" said Reynolds. \"And every generation [of Pixel] has brought new technologies.\"\nCamera Coach\nReynolds noted, \"LLMs have such an enormous context window, and they're so powerful at understanding that we can actually teach people to do things that tech can't do.\n\"Today, tech cannot move the camera down four feet. Tech can't walk the camera over 100 yards to the better viewpoint. It can't tell you to turn 90 degrees. Now, Camera Coach can do that kind of stuff. So that's just another way we're using technology to solve some of these durable problems.\"\nConversational editing\nOne of the most surprising new features Google announced in the Pixel 10 was conversational photo editing -- although this is technically a feature in the Google Photos app. This lets you simply describe what you want changed in the photo, with voice or typing, and the AI takes care of the rest. So you can remove a tree, re-center the image, or add more clouds to the sky, for example.\nAs Reynolds explained it, \"Conversational editing just takes the whole interface away and it's essentially a mapping function from natural language to the things that were in the editor. So you can say, 'Erase the thing on the left,' and it will just figure out what the thing on the left is and then invoke Magic Eraser. You can say, 'Hey, when I was in Utah I remember the rocks being more red than that' and it just increases the warmth a little bit. You can say, 'Can you focus on the thing in the center' and it puts a little vignette around it.\n\"And that mapping is a huge time saver. The promise of AI was not just that it would be informational, but it was that it would take actions for you. And I think this is one of the most perfect cases of the AI not just reminding you of something ... but doing it for you. It has been really, really cool to see how effective it is.\n\"It even gives you suggestions. The AI will look at a picture and say 'I think you have some bystanders you would want to remove.' And so it populates these little suggestion chips. The funniest part of the suggestion chips is when you tap them, all it does is type into the text box. It's not a separate pathway. You just tap the chip and it sticks something in the text box. You could have written that yourself. It's not doing anything wildly different than you could do... It's also got the voice button, which is super cool. You could just talk to it if you want to. The AI is getting so good so much faster than I could imagine, and I'm a professional in this space.\"\nPro Res Zoom\nAs a photographer who loves zoom photography, this was the feature I wanted to talk with Reynolds about the most. I take a lot of photos with smartphones, but long distance zooms are where I most often need to pull out my Sony mirrorless camera and 70-200mm lens. I've already written about how excited I am to thoroughly test Pro Res Zoom, since it could help produce a lot more usable zoom photos from a phone by using generative AI to fill in the gaps in digital zoom.\nReynolds commented, \"The fundamental problem is, how do I turn a digital zoom where you've got a sensor pixel on the far right corner, and then another one on the bottom left corner. And you have to fill in all the pixels in between. You can do an interpolation. You can just set them all to be some color, like just average them. We've grown all the way through the process here. We've gone through multi-frame denoise. We've gone through multiple different generations of upscalers to make better interpolations. We went to a multi-frame merge that was block-by-block. And then the major advancement that was Super Res Zoom was going from a block-by-block multi-frame to a probabilistic pixel-by-pixel multi-frame... In parallel, the upscalers were improving. And the latest generation upscaler is the largest model we've ever run in Pixel Camera ever... And it's just a really, really good interpolator.\nAlso: I replaced my Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with the Pixel 10 Pro XL for a week - and can't go back\n\"It doesn't just say that's black and that's white, and so the middle is gray. It's like, well, I know that that black pixel is part of a larger structure. I know that that larger structure appears to be the grout in between some brick on a facade. And so probably it's going to be black up until that point, and then it's going to turn red -- which is so much smarter than just going, 'Well, it's black and it's red. So, I don't know. I guess we'll just mix them as we go across.' So we still have those real things as real pixels, and then we have to fill in what's in between. And now the models are just so, so good at that.\n\"We've had a long line of upscalers, and this is the latest one. All the upscalers have artifacts. Different upscalers have different kinds of problems. We've had upscalers in the past that were very, very good at text -- because text has very harsh lines -- but very bad at water, because water is fundamentally chaotic. This upscaler has its own artifacts, and those artifacts are very difficult for the human eye to recognize, because the new models are so good at making content that is 100% authentic to the scene.\n\"Like, yes, that's a leaf on a tree. That's exactly what a leaf on a tree looks like. It's flawless. But for a human face, there is so much of the human brain dedicated to recognizing faces, that no level of artifact is effectively acceptable. The level of subtle artifact on a leaf, you may never notice. But the same subtlety on a face, you notice instantly -- just because we're human beings and we're designed to recognize other human beings. We're social creatures, so the bar for actually doing a good job with human faces is extraordinarily high.\"\nAs a result, when Pro Res Zoom recognizes a human face, it won't use the AI to upscale it.\nC2PA metadata to label AI\nBecause Google is now part of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA), it has started to embed metadata into its photos to indicate whether generative AI was used to make the photo by using SynthID, a watermark created by Google DeepMind. Reynolds was deeply involved with the project to make this part of Pixel Camera.\n\"The [C2PA] metadata identifies whether this was AI or not, and it just generally tells you the history of the picture and we embed it,\" said Reynolds. \"I was personally the product manager for that. I don't do things personally like that a lot anymore, but I did take that one because I knew how important, nuanced, and subtle it was. And the deeper I got into that feature, the more I realized how little people actually know about what AI is or isn't, what it can and can't do, or how fast or slow it's progressing.\"\nEducating the public about AI\n\"The world is honestly behind in terms of not realizing how good AI is already. So there's some education to do. And we realize that AI can do things that I think users would really, really like if they understood better what was going on. So part of what we do in Pro Res Zoom is we don't touch faces. I think that'll make people more comfortable. We also show them the before and after -- the version with the new upscaler and the one without it, and you get to decide for yourself, what did AI do? Did I find it acceptable or unacceptable? The overwhelming majority are finding it more than acceptable -- highly preferred, in fact. They want the upscale. But they wouldn't know that if they didn't get to see the side-by-side.\n\"And then we also label it with content credentials [C2PA] so that whenever they transmit that photo, somebody else can make their own decision about, 'How do I imagine this photo? Do I discount this as maybe AI? Or do I go, oh no, the content credentials are right there. They say it's not AI at all. This is great. I have so much more trust now.' And as users learn more, as they're educated more, as they gain more comfort and more real world data points of what is AI and what isn't, I think they will end up being more comfortable over time, and that's what we're seeing with Pro Res Zoom already. The customer satisfaction that we measured pre-launch was so good for that feature.\n\"And as the technology gets better, we'll do more. We will put this stuff into more modes, perhaps. We'll push the zoom a little higher quality. But we really want to make sure that we're doing that as users expect and understand it. So we're giving you options and choices and transparency, but we're also trying to push the boundaries of technology in a way that keeps customer satisfaction high.\"\nTelephoto Panoramas\n\"There are always little goodies hidden all over the [camera] app,\" Reynolds told me. \"We build more stuff than we can realistically talk about.\"\nOne of the new photography features in the Pixel 10 Pro that Google hasn't talked much about is Telephoto Panoramas, or what they affectionately call \"5x tele-panos.\"\nThese allow you to take more cinematic landscape shots using the zoom lens, new viewfinder controls, and the ability to shoot 360 degrees and up to 100MP resolution. \"There's something that's just so nice about zooming in with your lens and then stitching the panorama,\" said Reynolds.\nBut what Google hasn't talked about is the fact that it's using an entirely new method of capturing these panoramic images.\nAlso: Google Pixel 10 Pro vs. iPhone 16 Pro: I've tried both flagships, and there's an easy winner\n\"A lot of panoramas in the market, and ours historically as well, were video-based,\" Reynolds noted. \"And what that means is to make a panorama, you take 100 to 1000 images, and each one of them, you stitch a little tiny vertical slice. So that means two things. Number one, it means that the artifacts you get tend to be curves, stretches, and compressions because you're just going slice by slice. The other problem is that in that 30 seconds, you have to process [up to] 1000 images.\n\"So what we did is we said instead of a video we're going to use photo input. So we're going to take five pictures, not hundreds, and we're going to put all of our processing behind it -- full HDR Plus, full computational photography, Night Sight -- and then we stitch a little bit of overlap. So instead of having a little sliver from each picture, it's just a little overlap. That's how [Adobe] Lightroom would do it, for example. We're using the Lightroom method.\n\"And so we get Night Sight Panorama. We get panoramas now up to 100 megapixels. We get just super, super detailed and we can turn on parts of the zoom pipeline that we couldn't necessarily do before. So you can use the 2x zoom, which on a Pixel phone has optical quality. And you can even invoke the 5x telephoto [on the Pixel Pro]. It's a very computational-photography-forward, photo-based panorama.\"\nGuided Frame (accessibility feature)\nAnother feature that has flown under the radar that Reynolds wanted to point out was Guided Frame.\n\"Guided Frame is an accessibility feature. If you are blind or low-vision, we use Gemini to allow you to frame any photo,\" said Reynolds. \"In that case, you point the camera, you invoke Guided Frame, and it says, 'This is a photo of a scene of the woods with some trees off to the right and a person on the left. Person is in frame, smiling, good for a selfie. And then it will take the photo. So if you can't really see the screen that well, it helps take selfies and photos, because [selfies] are how people communicate. Whether you're blind or low-vision or not, people communicate using pictures. So it gives them that capability.\"\nAuto Best Take\nI also asked Reynolds about the evolution of Best Take to Auto Best Take this year and was surprised to learn that this feature is actually using more machine learning.\n\"Auto Best Take is much more traditional processing,\" Reynolds commented. \"You can imagine this as a decision tree, because that's essentially what this feature is. You press the shutter once. If that shutter press was perfect and everyone was smiling, everyone's looking at the camera, then great. Done. One picture.\n\"Okay, let's say it wasn't perfect. Then we're going to open the shutter a little longer and we're going to look at every single frame. So that's up to 150 frames in just a few seconds. If we see one that's better, we'll take it, we'll save that one, we'll process it in full HDR Plus quality... So when you go to the gallery, you're going to see the one that we took as the primary, that's called Top Shot. So that's one step down the decision tree.\n\"Let's say we looked at 150 frames and we couldn't find one that was perfect, but we found one that was almost perfect, and a second one that was almost perfect but in a different way, such as a different face. Then what we'll do is we'll save both of those and then we'll pass that to Best Take and Best Take will blend them into one that is perfect. And Top Shot will intentionally choose a range of pictures so that there's at least one photo in which every face is smiling. So if there is a picture of every face smiling at least once somewhere in the set then it will do a Best Take. Once you look at 150 pictures, most of the time you get the shot. So very rarely does it actually go to Best Take. So it's a little odd that we call it Auto Best Take, because in reality, we don't do it very often, since it's at the end of the decision tree.\n\"The goal is that you press the shutter one time and you get one photo and that photo is perfect. It does not matter how we get there. We never want you to have to take three photos [of the same group picture] again. Because why would you take three random photos when [the AI] can look at 150 photos. So we say just press [the shutter button] once. Give it a couple of seconds. You'll see it in the UI. It draws boxes around people's faces. It turns them gold when it thinks it nailed it. So press the shutter, give it a couple seconds, and then watch what you get at the end.\"\nThe difference with Tensor G5\nGoogle made a big move in 2025 with its Tensor G5 chip powering the Pixel 10 phones -- shifting from having Samsung build its Tensor chips in the past to a TSMC 3nm process that uses TSMC's advanced technology to increase AI performance. I asked Reynolds about the impact.\nAlso: Considering the Pixel 10 Pro? I recommend buying these 5 phones instead - here's why\n\"[The boost with Tensor G5] is one of the largest before-and-afters I've ever seen in terms of processing latency,\" he noted. \"The first versions of Pro Res Zoom took like two minutes [to process]. And then by the end, once they got it on Tensor G5 and all the bugs had been worked out, that got down to just several seconds... So the Tensor G5 TPU is 60% more powerful, and we can definitely see that.\"\nThe AI models powering Pixel photography\nSince so many of the Pixel 10's most important new features are powered by AI advances, I wanted to know more about how the Pixel Camera team works with Google's internal AI capabilities.\n\"It's not like there's this one monolithic Gemini,\" Reynolds said. \"It is extremely carefully tuned and tested for one particular use case at a time... There are so many more versions of Gemini inside [Google] than you can see outside. And then you have to decide, am I going to prompt this Gemini or am I going to fine-tune this Gemini? It's all super, super custom to a particular implementation.\" For example, he added, \"Magic Eraser is generative, but it's not Gemini.\"\nFinal thought\nGoogle is the only one among the dozen or so companies in the world building frontier AI models that also makes its own smartphone. And with the Pixel 10 Pro, the impact is starting to show."

If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nI've tested every single Galaxy S25 phone - and my favorite isn't the flagship model\nAt Amazon, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus is on sale for $800, a $200 discount from its retail price.\nThe \"middle child\" often gets a bad rap, but the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, which sits right between the smaller S25 and more-capable S25 Ultra, flips the script. Because after just a few days of use, it's quickly become my favorite model of the three.\nAlso: Samsung offers $1,000 off preorder deal for new Galaxy foldable phones ahead of Unpacked\nPart of the reason is less to do with the S25 Plus and more with the larger, square-shaped Ultra model that I tested first. Even with my larger-than-average hands, I wouldn't exactly call the S25 Ultra's design burdenless; the corners still dig into your palms with extended use, and reaching for certain corners of the screen -- for checkboxes, menu buttons, etc. -- requires a level of finger gymnastics that no other phone prepares you for.\nOn the other hand, the S25 Plus, with its rounded edges and slimmer profile, is much less jarring -- and the new Navy color gives it a charm that not even the Ultra can match. When I first held my S25 Plus review unit a few months ago, my first thought was, \"If this model already feels this thin, how much thinner is the new Edge?\" That's a compliment to both devices.\nBut there's more to it than fit and finish. After all, if a compact design is what you're after, the standard Galaxy S25 is just as considerable. For $200 more than the S25 and $300 less than the Ultra, the S25 Plus strikes the best balance of form and function.\nAlso: I changed 10 Samsung phone settings for an instant performance boost\nSome key distinctions make the S25 Plus model a significant step up over the standard S25, from double the base storage (256GB versus 128GB) to a much larger battery (4,900mAh versus 4,000mAh) to the QHD+ display (versus FHD). The larger battery, with only a slight differential in thickness and an extra telephoto lens, also gives the S25 Plus a leg up over the S25 Edge, in my opinion.\nThe higher-resolution display allows the S25 Plus to support Samsung's new ProScaler feature, which automatically upscales lower-resolution content so that it appears sharper and crisper. When I compared the S25 Plus with ProScaler to the S25 without it, the latter device lacked a level of clarity.\nThen there's the feature parity between the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra -- which, again, costs $300 more. If you went into this comparison blindly, you would expect the Ultra model to have a better processor, camera system, software features, and charging capabilities. Only one of the items on that list is different.\nThe S25 Plus has the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, suite of Galaxy AI tools, and identical wired and wireless charging speeds (45W and 15W, respectively) as the S25 Ultra, but it doesn't have the same 200-megapixel-led camera system. But that's okay.\nAlso: T-Mobile will give you a free Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus right now - how to qualify for the deal\nThe versatility of the S25 Plus' triple camera system, which includes a 10MP telephoto with 3x zoom, is more than enough for most users, including myself. A lot of what makes modern-day smartphone cameras so good has to do with the computational processes that run in the background. Also, there's not much difference between the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra, which is great.\nTwo exceptions to camera output are if you're very passionate about macro photography, which the S25 Ultra's new 50MP ultrawide lens excels at, and capturing a less-than-optimal shot of the Statue of Liberty from across the borough. For almost every other use case, the S25 Plus will serve you well.\nMy argument is made easier with Samsung nerfing this year's S Pen functionality, reducing the S25 Ultra's exclusive accessory to a mere touchscreen stylus and nothing more. If you don't see yourself needing the precision inputs of the stylus, then the hardware difference is negligible.\nAlso: Your Android phone just got a major upgrade for free - including these Pixel models\nTo be clear, this isn't a knock on the S25 Ultra; that model will almost surely be at the top of our best phones rankings until the end of this year. But it's easy to ignore the S25 Plus when the standard S25 and S25 Ultra cover both ends of the flagship spectrum so well, and you may be wondering if it's better to fork up the extra $300 if you're already spending $1,000 on a new Samsung phone.\nBut a closer look at how all the specifications fare should suggest that maybe -- just maybe -- being the boring middle child may not always be a bad thing.\nWhat are the tariffs in the US?\nThe recent US tariffs on imports from countries like China, Vietnam, and India aim to boost domestic manufacturing but are likely to drive up prices on consumer electronics. Products like smartphones, laptops, and TVs may become more expensive as companies rethink global supply chains and weigh the cost of shifting production.\nCNET: Tariff Pricing Tracker: We're Watching 11 Products You Might Need to Buy\nSmartphones are among the most affected by the new US tariffs, with devices imported from China and Vietnam facing steep duties that could raise retail prices by 20% or more. Brands like Apple and Google, which rely heavily on Asian manufacturing, may either pass these costs on to consumers or absorb them at the expense of profit margins.\nThe tariffs could also lead to delays in product launches or shifts in where and how phones are made, forcing companies to diversify production to countries with more favorable trade conditions.\nThis article was originally published on January 28, 2025, and was updated on June 25, 2025."

While I had already spent a few hours fiddling with the phone back in May, going through my everyday routine with a device that's significantly thinner, and more importantly, lighter, than any other phone I've recently tested has been revolutionary.\nAlso: If these iPhone 17 Air rumors are real, my old phone is about to be retired\nWith the S25 Edge, it's the little things: how the phone's lightness makes magnetic cases harder to accidentally detach from mounts, how much less burdensome it feels to hold up a 6.8-inch screen when my other hand is hanging on the subway railing, and how the phone hurts a little less when I drop it on my face in bed.\nIf there's one big takeaway from testing the S25 Edge since launch, it's that thin and light phones have spoiled me in every way but one. Unfortunately for Samsung, that one drawback is enough to convince any user to look elsewhere. Let me explain.\nYour first impression of the S25 Edge will likely be the same as mine and the many others who experience an ultra-thin phone in 2025. It's an engineering marvel, with a lightweight (163 grams) build encased in the same titanium material that keeps the more expensive S25 Ultra model protected from bumps and scratches.\nAlso: Android 16 totally changes how notifications work on your phone, thanks to two new features\nWhile the 6.8-inch display shares the same specifications as the S25 Plus model, the hand feel is completely different. It almost feels wrong not to be burdened by holding a big-screen phone, but that's the ultra-thin phone experience, and I have been sold on that aspect since Day 1.\nSamsung said it pulled a lot of design cues from its Z Fold line when designing the S25 Edge, and I believe it. I've used every Samsung foldable phone since the first generation in 2019 and have always wondered how nice it would be to split the foldable screen in half but retain the slimness. The S25 Edge is effectively that, making almost every other phone I've tried to pick up since testing it feel outdated.\nAlso: I changed 10 Samsung phone settings to significantly improve the user experience\nI'm less enthusiastic about the lack of an anti-glare screen, which is one of the most underrated features on the S25 Ultra model. Sure, the S25 Edge's peak brightness of 2,600 nits makes it just usable in broad daylight, but the presence of glare and reflections is felt, especially as the summer sun starts to beat down more often.\nIt's unfortunate because the S25 Edge is a phone that's destined to be nimble and carried around. Instead, I often find myself using the phone less when outdoors.\nFortunately, whenever I use the phone, it operates with grace. I can't pinpoint one thing for the solid performance, so I'll credit the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, the smoother animations of One UI 7, and the 12 GB of RAM, which is sufficient for hybrid AI tasks, mobile gaming, and loading various social media feeds.\nJust this weekend, I used the Gemini Live camera-sharing feature to inquire about how to deal with a wall of poison ivy on my backyard fence, stream Spotify to a Bluetooth speaker, and text my wife about dinner plans. This was all on LTE data, by the way, and the S25 Edge handled it all without many hiccups. I did notice the back of the phone, where the processor is housed near the camera module, frequently getting warm to the touch.\nThat leads me to believe that while Samsung put some effort into building a functional thermal-cooling system in the S25 Edge, it still has too little real estate to field something effective for modern-day usage. Any power user can easily rile this device up.\nAlso: I finally tried Samsung's XR headset, and it beats my Apple Vision Pro in meaningful ways\nOn the camera front, the S25 Edge comes with a 200 MP wide-angle lens and a 12 MP ultra-wide. I was originally disappointed that Samsung couldn't throw in a dedicated telephoto lens -- even the standard S25 model has one -- but in practice, I didn't find myself missing the far-distance sensor. In most cases, the 2x optical-level crop from the 200 MP (so long as you turn the resolution on in the viewfinder) delivered just the right amount of detail, color reproduction, and range that I needed for anything further out.\nSamsung says the 200 MP camera on the S25 Edge is Ultra-level but not exactly the same as the one found on the more expensive flagship. That said, I didn't notice a dramatic difference in image and video quality when comparing the two phones. In fact, there were moments when I preferred the output from the S25 Edge, which doesn't oversaturate colors as much as I'm used to from Samsung phones.\nThe biggest question mark going into testing the S25 Edge, and really for every other thin phone moving forward, is how its battery fares. From my three weeks of testing, the battery life on the S25 Edge is subpar, though that shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone. The writing was on the wall; it's a large-screen phone (6.8-inch AMOLED) with a powerful processor (Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite) and a battery capacity (3,900 mAh) that's smaller than that of the smallest S25 model (4,000 mAh).\nSuffice it to say that the S25 Edge made battery anxiety a thing again, with my review unit consistently dropping to 10\u201320% power by late afternoon. Coming from just about any other phone in 2025, the dip in endurance was immediately noticeable when I began using the device back in May.\nAlso: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Z Fold 6: I tried both phones, and the difference is dramatic\nEven after it's gone through a few cycles of learning my usage patterns, and moments when I'd have to nerf the settings to 60 Hz refresh rate and turn on power-saving mode, I'm still nowhere near all-day battery life. This is a deal-breaker for me, and will likely be for anyone else who's often away from an outlet or doesn't want to carry a portable battery everywhere they go. It doesn't help that the S25 Edge caps out at 25 W wired charging, falling short of the 45 W rating on the S25 Plus.\nHad Samsung been more willing to flex its ingenuity muscles and embed a silicon-carbon battery -- popular among Asian smartphone manufacturers for its increased energy density -- you may be looking at one of the best phones of 2025. Instead, this is a big case of \"what if,\" with the biggest winner being Samsung itself, which now gets to tell Apple that they made the ultra-thin phone first. Take that for what you will.\nZDNET's buying advice\nI'll reiterate that the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is this close to being my dream phone, with the design and hardware being almost as good as one can hope for at $1,099. But the lackluster battery life is the ultra-thin phone's Achilles' heel. Samsung should've been aware of this downside going into the manufacturing process, and the clearest solution (silicon-carbon batteries) has existed on the market for at least the past year.\nAs a result, you're looking at a futuristic phone that's held back by an old-school problem.\nOf course, if you find the below-average battery life to be a worthy trade-off for a lightweight yet powerful handset, then the S25 Edge is as good as it gets right now. I've lost count of the number of iPhone users who bought into the idea of a thin phone just seconds after I handed them the S25 Edge. But if you want something safer, longer-lasting, and somehow more capable, consider the S25 Plus and you won't regret it.\nThis article was originally published on June 2, 2025, and was updated on September 2, 2025, to reflect the latest Amazon deal, which brings the phone price down to $699."

At first glance, they don't seem all that useful since you can also do these actions with your mouse, but I challenge you to try them over the course of a workday; you just might notice a boost in productivity.\nAlso: How much RAM does your PC really need in 2025? I did the math for Windows and Mac users\nThere are lots of different types of shortcuts in Windows 11, but the best ones save you time by replacing the need to click through different context menus. A few of these are universal across applications and platforms. Ctrl + C, for example, copies text or files in any app, from Microsoft Word to photos in Google Drive.\nHere's a list of more than 40 Windows PC keyboard shortcuts you should know.\nProductivity shortcuts\nProductivity shortcuts are the key combos you'll find yourself using the most. They're easy to use and help you manage your work. Over time, these keystrokes become second nature.\n- Ctrl + C -- Copy highlighted text or a file.\n- Ctrl + V -- Paste whatever you just copied. Keeps the text's format.\n- Ctrl + Shift + V - Paste whatever you copied, but it removes the formatting.\n- Windows key (Win, for short) + V -- Opens the Clipboard tool, which contains a list of previously copied text. This helps in situations where you might've \"erased\" the previous copied item.\n- Ctrl + X -- Cuts the highlighted item. Ctrl + V restores it.\n- Ctrl + Z -- Undoes the last action, such as restoring deleted text or returning a moved file.\n- Ctrl + Y -- Redoes the action that was just undone.\n- Ctrl + F -- Opens the Find tool, so you can search for specific words or phrases.\n- Ctrl + A -- Highlight every single item in a window or text in a document.\n- Ctrl + S -- Quick save your work.\n- Ctrl + Backspace -- Delete the entire previous word\n- Ctrl + Delete -- Delete the entire next word.\nAccessibility shortcuts\nWindows 11 has various accessibility shortcuts that make the OS easier to use. These shortcuts help people with movement limitations or conditions that may restrict their usage of Windows. That said, anybody can use them to improve their experience.\n- Win + Plus (+) -- Activates the Magnifier tool and automatically zooms in on the screen.\n- Win + Minus (-) -- Zooms out while the Magnifier tool is activated. Hitting Win + Esc exits out of Magnifier.\n- Win + Ctrl + Enter -- Launches Narrator, a text-to-speech function that verbally describes what is on screen.\n- Press the Shift key five times in succession -- Turns on Sticky keys, which change how shortcuts work so you don't have to press and hold multiple keys to trigger them. For example, under Sticky Keys, double-tapping Ctrl then C has the same effect as Ctrl + C.\n- Left Shift + Left Alt + Print Screen -- Toggles high contrast mode for easier readability.\n- Win + Ctrl + C -- Toggles color filters like grayscale. The filters can be changed in the Accessibility menu to invert colors or help people with deuteranopia (also known as red-green color blindness).\n- Win + U -- Opens the Accessibility menu in Settings, where you can activate or deactivate accessibility-related features.\n- Win + Ctrl + O -- Opens the on-screen keyboard.\nNavigation shortcuts\nNavigation shortcuts allow users to move around different apps on Windows 11 without ever needing to lift their hands off the keyboard. They're especially useful for multitaskers juggling several programs at once. Once you master them, navigating your PC will feel seamless.\n- Ctrl + Alt + Tab -- Shows all open apps. Use the arrow keys to hop from one to the other.\n- Win + S -- Opens Windows Search.\n- Win + Tab -- Opens Task View, revealing all open windows and all open desktops.\n- Win + D -- Hides every window on your desktop. Pressing the keys again reveals them.\n- Win + Left or Right Directional Arrow -- Snaps the current window to the side of the screen that the arrow is pointing to.\n- Win + Up Arrow -- Maximizes a window.\n- Win + Down Arrow -- Minimizes the same window.\n- Win + Ctrl + D -- Create a new desktop.\n- Win + Ctrl + F4 -- Closes a desktop.\n- Win + Number Key -- Opens a taskbar app pinned to that number. For example, Win + 3 could open Microsoft Edge while Win + 4 opens the Microsoft Store.\nAlso: Finally, a Windows laptop that I wouldn't mind putting away my MacBook for\nFile Management shortcuts\nThe Windows 11 File Explorer has its own set of keyboard shortcuts to help users reorganize folders and files. Instead of right-clicking through menus or dragging items around to clean up clutter, these simple key presses make managing documents a breeze.\n- Win + E -- Opens File Explorer.\n- F2 -- Rename the selected file or folder. Depending on the keyboard, you may also have to hold Fn.\n- Shift + Delete -- Permanently deletes an item. Hitting just Delete only sends the file to the recycling bin.\n- Ctrl + N -- Opens a new File Explorer window. It stays on the page of the previous window.\n- Ctrl + Shift + N -- Create a new folder.\n- Alt + Enter -- Opens the Properties window for a file and folder.\n- Alt + Left or Right Arrow -- Move forward or backward through your File Explorer History.\n- Alt + Up Arrow -- Go back one folder level.\nAlso: Best early Labor Day laptop deals: Sales on Apple, Dell, Lenovo, and more\nBrowser shortcuts\nBrowser shortcuts are similar to Productivity shortcuts in that they do similar things, like copying and pasting items or highlighting entire documents. However, there are a few unique tools, like the ability to create tabs. The following were tested and confirmed to work across various browsers: Chrome, Edge, and Firefox.\n- Ctrl + T -- Open a new tab.\n- Ctrl + Shift + T -- Reopen the last closed tab. (This one is huge!)\n- Ctrl + W -- Close the current tab.\n- Ctrl + Tab -- Move right through tabs.\n- Ctrl + Shift + Tab -- Move left through the tabs.\n- Ctrl + Shift + N -- Open new private browsing window. On Firefox, this is Ctrl + Shift + P.\n- Alt + Left or Right Arrow -- Move back and forth through tab history.\n- Ctrl + D -- Bookmark page.\n- Ctrl + H -- Open browser history.\n- Ctrl + N -- Open a brand new browser window.\nWhy should you trust me?\nI've been writing about software and consumer electronics for almost 10 years. In that time, I've worked in many different settings, from the traditional office to the home office and even someone's backyard. Over the years, I've picked up a lot of tricks to help me get through my day-to-day tasks.\nAlso: I tested the best antivirus software for Windows: Here's what I'd use to protect my PC\nMany of the shortcuts in this guide I use every day, even when I'm not working. CTRL + Z has practically become my best friend because I use it so often. Some of these shortcuts I learned about for the first time while researching this piece. I didn't know that the File Manager has so many shortcuts under its toolbelt, but once I started using them, I immediately saw their value to expert and casual users alike."

With a starting price of $999, it offers a compelling blend of premium features borrowed from its more expensive sibling, all in the more manageable size of the standard Pixel 10.\nAlso: I replaced my Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with the Pixel 10 Pro XL for a week - and can't go back\nThe Pixel 10 Pro enters a crowded field, competing directly with the iPhone 16 Pro and the Galaxy S25 Plus.\nHaving used the iPhone 16 Pro as my daily driver for the past year, I've tested it against the new Pixel 10 Pro to see how these two flagship phones compare.\nYou should buy the Google Pixel 10 Pro if\u2026\n1. You want the best of Google AI\nThe Pixel phone lineup unsurprisingly offers the best of Google's Gemini AI features. And it is only getting better with the Pixel 10 Pro. The company is providing a year of Google AI Pro service for free alongside the purchase for Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL. So, you get Gemini Pro, including NotebookLM for productivity and Veo 3 text-to-video generation model.\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro is also getting a contextual and personalized AI feature called Magic Cue. Theoretically, it can \"help connect the dots across your digital life by anticipating your needs and proactively suggesting relevant information and helpful actions based on the context on your phone.\"\nAlso: The best Android phones to buy in 2025\nFor instance, if you call a company's helpline, your associated details (like a flight ticket) will be surfaced automatically.\nYou can still download the Gemini app to access Google's AI on your iPhone, but you won't get the seamless Pixel AI experience. If you depend on Google apps to get work done and have all your digital life stored on Google's platforms, the Pixel 10 Pro is the better option.\n2. You want a better telephoto camera\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro features a 48MP Quad PD telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom, as compared to a 12MP telephoto sensor (also 5x optical zoom) on the iPhone 16 Pro. However, megapixels don't solely define a camera. The Pixel 10 Pro sports a bigger sensor than its Apple counterpart. On paper, it is capable of letting more light in and snapping better-looking photos.\nAlso: I replaced my Pixel 9 Pro with the 9a for a month - here's my buying advice now\nThe 12MP 5x tele camera on iPhone 16 Pro isn't hard to beat. It struggles in anything less than bright daylight and lacks the zoom capabilities of its Chinese rivals. I'm looking forward to using the Google Pixel 10 Pro for my zoom shots and expect it to beat the iPhone.\n3. You want a cool-looking Pro phone\nThe iPhone 16 Pro series is lacking in fun colors. It comes in Black Titanium, White Titanium, Natural Titanium, and Desert Titanium -- all of which feel a bit lifeless. The last Pro iPhone color I truly loved was Sierra Blue on my iPhone 13 Pro Max.\nWhile rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Pro might bring back more playful finishes, Google has already beaten Apple to the punch with the Pixel 10 Pro series. The new Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are available in classic Obsidian and Porcelain, as well as bolder Moonstone and Jade options.\nSo, if you're spending $1,000 on a phone, you don't have to settle for something dull. Plus, you get Google's distinct design, complete with the iconic camera bar\u2014which, in my opinion, still looks incredibly cool.\n4. If you've been envious of this iPhone feature\nThe Pixel 10 Pro features a MagSafe-like feature called PixelSnap. It is based on Qi2 charging, which offers magnetic accessory support for power banks, chargers, and more. If you've been on the iPhone for a while and want to switch platforms, this is the best time to come to the Android side.\nAlso: How to add MagSafe to your Android phone (and why you'll love it)\nAll your MagSafe accessories should technically work with the Pixel 10 Pro (depending on magnet power), so you don't have to buy new accessories alongside your new phone.\nYou should buy the Apple iPhone 16 Pro if\u2026\n1. You want a lighter Pro phone\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro might look better on paper, but it's nearly 10 grams heavier than the iPhone 16 Pro. Specifically, the Pixel weighs 207 grams compared to the iPhone's 199 grams.\nAlso: Buy the iPhone 16 or wait for iPhone 17? Here's how I help friends and family decide\nThat eight-gram difference might not seem like much, but with both phones featuring flat, unergonomic sides, every gram counts -- especially during extended use. If you average more than six hours of screen time a day, the iPhone 16 Pro could be the more comfortable choice.\n2. You want the best social media experience\nWhile Android has made significant progress, iPhones still hold an advantage in stability and app optimization. This is particularly noticeable with social media apps like X and Instagram, where the user experience remains smoother on Apple devices.\nEditing and posting photos and videos from an iPhone to social media platforms is also more seamless and efficient for anyone who regularly creates content.\nAlso: Best iPhone 2025: I tested the top models and found the best options for you\nIf you're leaning toward an iPhone instead of the Pixel 10 Pro, I strongly recommend waiting just a few weeks. Apple is expected to launch its new iPhone 17 series in early September. It's smart to hold off on your decision until after the typical September 10th launch event to make sure you get the latest model."

Oh, and there was one more thing.\nAs expected, Samsung launched its newest flagship smartphones: Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra. The hardware has remained mostly unchanged, with thinner and lighter form factors across the board, an upgraded chipset, and some fresh coats of paint. For the more significant improvements, you'll want to look at the software.\nAlso: Best Samsung Galaxy S25 deals: $200 gift cards and free offers at T-Mobile and Verizon\nSamsung kicked things up a notch with its latest AI offerings in One UI 7, with a focus on making people's everyday interactions with their phones as seamless as possible. Some highlights include a new personal data engine, multi-app commands, and a Now Brief feature that anticipates your needs and packages them neatly for you.\nIf you missed the live event and want to catch up on all the news, I've gathered all the products and features announced at Unpacked below.\n1. Samsung Galaxy S25 and S25+\nLike past January Unpacked events, Samsung released three new Galaxy S models, with the base models getting some subtle but meaningful upgrades, including a thinner and lighter design.\nOther changes include the introduction of new colors, including Icyblue, Navy, Mint, Silver Shadow, as well as online-only exclusive colors like Blueblack, Coralred, and Pinkgold. The vibrance of the Coralred colorway stands out amongst the rest of the lineup's more muted finishes, and made a splash among reporters at Unpacked.\nAlso: I went hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy S25 - and the AI features were surprisingly polished\nAt the heart of the devices is the newly launched Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy. According to Samsung, the chipset will be dramatically different than the variants found on competing Android phones.\nFor example, Samsung claims it delivers a performance boost of 40% in NPU, 37% in CPU, and 30% in GPU compared to the Galaxy S24 Ultra. Beyond AI, the chipset will help provide a smoother experience when gaming, equipped with Vulkan Engine, a high-performing graphics platform, and improved Ray Tracing.\nOther specs remain the same as last year's model, such as its 6.2-inch and 6.7-inch display, 4,000mAh and 4,900mAh batteries,120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate, 50 MP main lens, a 12MP ultrawide, a 10 MP telephoto, and a 12MP selfie camera.\nAlso: Best One UI 7 features coming to Samsung Galaxy S25 models (and older phones, too)\nDespite the camera hardware remaining the same, the software upgrades should significantly improve the experience. For example, 10-bit HDR recording is now applied by default, allowing users to capture better detail, and a new Galaxy Virtual Aperture, integrated into the Expert RAW app, gives users better depth-of-field control, similar to when using a DSLR.\nGalaxy S25+ and S25 Ultra also feature advanced AI image processing with ProScaler, which, like Samsung TVs, uses AI to digitally enhance the resolution of videos. Just know that the phones need to be set to QHD+ resolution to take advantage of the feature.\nPricing for the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus starts at $799 and $999, respectively. That's the same as past years' retail price, which is good to see, provided you're getting improvements -- some in hardware and more in software.\n2. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra received several design upgrades, the most obvious being its rounded edges, a departure from the typical Ultra design that makes it akin to other flagship phones on the market, such as, dare I say, the iPhone.\nLike the rest of the line, the S25 Ultra is lighter and slimmer, weighing 218 grams compared to the S24 Ultra's 232 grams, and measuring 8.2mm compared to 8.6mm. Despite its leaner form factor, it is more durable than ever, featuring a new Corning Gorilla Armor 2, which provides advanced drop protection and scratch resistance.\nAlso: Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra vs iPhone 16 Pro Max: Which phone should you buy?\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra features a 6.9-inch AMOLED display and a similar anti-reflection coating as the S24 Ultra, which is great to see.\nAnother notable hardware upgrade is its 50MP ultrawide camera sensor, an upgrade from the S24 Ultra's 12MP, allowing users to capture more details in landscape and macro photos.\nThe rest of the cameras remain the same as the Galaxy S24 Ultra's, with a 200MP main lens, a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, a 50MP telephoto with 5X optical zoom, and a 12MP selfie camera. The phone also retains the same 5,000mAh battery capacity and embedded S Pen, though the latter no longer supports wireless air gestures.\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra is available in Titanium Silverblue, Titanium Whitesilver, Titanium Gray, and Titanium Black, and online-exclusive colors Titanium Pinkgold, Titanium Jetblack, and Titanium Jadegreen. It starts at $1,299, the same as last year, with 256GB of storage and 12GB of RAM.\n3. AI upgrades\nUndoubtedly, the star of the show was the S25 lineup's AI upgrades, which Samsung claimed: \"Set a new standard towards a true AI companion with our most natural and context-aware mobile experiences ever created.\"\nAs the description implies, AI was sprinkled nearly everywhere in the devices, from your more typical photo-editing and generating to more advanced, personalized features, such as personalized agents and LLMs, all meant to optimize how users use their phones daily.\nAlso: I tried Samsung's new Galaxy AI features - these 3 made Apple Intelligence look bad\nSince there are so many features, both made available through One UI 7 and Galaxy AI, here's the run-down of them all, along with a brief description of each.\nAI Select: AI Select is similar to Google's Circle to Search feature, except that when you select things on your screen, instead of searching the web, it provides you with actions you can take on your phone. For example, if you select a date on your screen, with AI select, your phone could suggest adding the date to your calendar, and when selected, does it for you.\nCircle to Search updates: Although Circle to Search is not new, it got some updates to make it more efficient. It can recognize phone numbers, emails, and URLs on the screen, and allow you to visit said links or click the number to make a call. It's also multimodal, allowing you to use Circle to Search to search audio, which can identify the name of a song you're hearing.\nCross-app action: Using natural language, you can now simply ask Gemini to perform actions across multiple apps, with a prompt such as, \"Search for the upcoming Warriors game and add to calendar.\"\nAI Photo Search: If you need to find a photo, you can use a natural language prompt through search through your library.\nSettings Search: Similar to above, you can now use natural language to figure out where a setting on your phone is. A command may look something like, \"Help me make my text bigger.\"\nAlso: Every Samsung Galaxy S25 model compared: Which phone should you buy?\nPersonal Data Engine: Think of your Personal Data Engine as a personal LLM that you design from the ground up. The more you use your device, the more it learns from you from your everyday usage. The data is stored on the device, and not on the cloud for extra security, so if you lose the phone, it's lost forever. This information can provide tailored experiences for you such as the new Now Brief feature.\nNow Brief: This feature can give you suggestions accessible via your Now Bar on the lock screen, anticipating your needs. For example, based on your routines and habits, it may suggest driving mode or navigation.\n- Audio eraser: This feature gives users more control over audio in videos, allowing you to adjust different audio elements in your videos, such as voices, wind, noises, and more. For example, if you want the background noise to be quieter, you can lower it, or you can make the forefront noise louder.\n- Improved Generative Edit: This feature, which removes unwanted elements from your photographs, can now also remove shadows as well, making the edit more seamless.\n4. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge\nWhile we didn't see a new pair of smart glasses or ring at the end of the show this year, the company did tease a new product -- one that's arguably even more significant.\nAlso: Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge first look: Specs and features, release date, price, more\nThe Galaxy S25 Edge is what the company is calling it, and from the teasers and seconds-long sizzle reel we got at the end of the presentation, there's one obvious takeaway: it's super thin. So thin that the phone will only feature two cameras, and not three like the rest of the Galaxy S25 lineup.\nAccording to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, the S25 Edge will launch in the first half of this year, with pricing expected to be below the S25 Ultra's $1,299.\n5. Project Moohan XR headset\nSamsung finally showcased its mixed reality headset, pictured above, to the public. Its form factor is similar to that of the Apple Vision Pro, resembling ski goggles, with a smooth, curved front, and head strap that sits at the back of the user's head.\nAlso: Here's the Android XR headset that Google and Samsung are releasing in 2025\nThe headset, codenamed Project Moohan and announced in December, is a collaboration with Google and Qualcomm. It will run on Android XR, its operating system for XR devices. Samsung says there's no official timeline in terms of when we'll see the device in the market, but the hardware making an appearance at Unpacked is promising.\nWhen is Samsung Unpacked?\nSamsung Unpacked took place on Wednesday, Jan. 22. The event started at 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET and was live-streamed for everyone to watch.\nThe physical event, reserved for media, super fans, and industry experts, occured in San Jose, California."

Check this setting to find out\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- Meta could be scanning your camera roll right now.\n- It's using your photos to provide AI-powered suggestions.\n- Check Facebook settings to turn off the features.\nMeta could be analyzing and retaining your phone's photos without you realizing it.\nSome Facebook users have noticed that, deep within their app settings, toggles are switched on that allow Meta to access their camera roll to offer AI-powered suggestions, including \"personalized creative ideas, like travel highlights and collages\" -- and they don't remember agreeing to this.\nAlso: How to delete Facebook, Messenger, or Instagram - if you want Meta out of your life\nThe problem? This feature allows Meta to access and retain your camera roll images, and that could raise serious privacy concerns, especially for users who wouldn't otherwise knowingly opt in.\nIf you do get Meta's \"cloud processing\" pop-up announcing this feature and tap \"Allow\" on it, you'll agree to Meta's AI Terms of Service and permit your \"media and facial features\" to be analyzed by AI.\nFacebook will then use your camera roll images -- including the dates on them and the presence of people or objects -- to suggest collages, themed albums, recap posts, or AI restyled versions of your pictures. These AI suggestions are only visible to you unless you choose to share them, and Meta says the media won't be used for ad targeting.\nAlso: How to protect your privacy from Facebook - and what doesn't work\nZDNET's editorial director found Meta's camera roll sharing suggestions enabled in her Facebook app without her knowledge. I also noticed they were enabled for me, although I vaguely recall seeing a pop-up from Facebook about the new features a few weeks ago. I think I dismissed it quickly, and I can't remember whether I tapped Allow or Don't allow on it.\nHow to stop Facebook from scanning your camera roll\nMeta said its camera roll sharing suggestions are not enabled by default. If you're worried you dismissed Facebook's pop-up, or unknowingly opted in, and gave access to your camera roll, here's how to check and turn it off.\n1. Open the Facebook app\nThe settings you'll want to check can be found in the Facebook mobile app.\n- Grab your iPhone or Android phone.\n- Open the Facebook app. You'll need to be signed into your account.\n2. Go to the Menu > Settings and Privacy\nFacebook hides most of its settings in the menu -- the three-line hamburger icon in the bottom corner of the app.\n- Tap the Menu icon in the bottom right corner of the screen.\nOnce the menu opens, look for Settings and Privacy with a gear icon.\n3. Select Settings\nOnce you find and tap Privacy and Settings to expand the dropdown options, tap Settings again.\n- Under Settings and Privacy, tap Settings.\n- Now, scroll down and look for \"Camera roll sharing suggestions.\"\n4. Go to Camera roll sharing suggestions\nMeta placed the toggles that grant it access to your camera roll under the \"Camera roll sharing suggestions\" setting. You'll need to go there to see if they're on and, if so, switch them off.\n- Tap the option labeled \"Camera roll sharing suggestions.\"\n- This will open a preference page with a couple of toggles.\n5. Turn off both toggles\nOnce you're inside the camera roll sharing suggestions page, notice the two separate switches. If they're blue and the toggle circle is pushed to the right, they're on -- meaning Meta is already processing and retaining your phone's photos. Turn them off so the app can't automatically upload and analyze your camera roll.\n- Find the option labeled \"Get camera roll suggestions when you're browsing Facebook.\" If the switch is on (blue), tap it once to turn it off (gray). This will stop Facebook from using basic camera roll data, such as which videos you've favorited and when photos were taken, to suggest sharing media you haven't yet uploaded.\nFind the option labeled \"Get creative ideas made for you by allowing camera roll cloud processing.\" If the switch is on (blue), tap it once to turn it off (gray). This will stop Facebook from continuously uploading media from your camera roll -- and using details like time, location, themes, and the presence of people or objects -- to generate personalized creative ideas such as recaps and AI restylings.\nFAQs\nThese steps don't work for me. Why?\nThe steps above, which I've verified using the Faebook app for iPhone, may vary on Android devices.\nSamsung users, for instance, must do the following: Open Facebook > Go to Profile/Menu > Tap the gear icon in the upper right > Scroll down to \"Camera roll sharing suggestions\" and select it > You'll see the two camera roll sharing toggles.\nDefinitely go to Facebook's support hub if you need more help. You basically got to find the Settings and privacy menu in the Facebook mobile app, and from there, you can find \"Camera roll sharing suggestions\" and disable the options.\nWhy is Facebook cloud-processing my device's camera roll?\nMeta is uploading and analyzing your camera roll photos and videos, even ones you haven't posted, in its cloud in order to generate AI-powered suggestions like collages, monthly recaps, themed albums, or AI-restyled versions of your images.\nWhere is this feature being tested?\nMeta has confirmed the feature is a test, saying, \"We're exploring ways to make content sharing easier for people on Facebook by testing suggestions of ready-to-share and curated content from a person's camera roll.\"\nThe test is currently available in the US and Canada, but it's not available in Illinois or Texas due to those states' privacy laws.\nDid Facebook ask for my consent before turning this on?\nMeta is showing a pop-up asking users if they want to enable cloud processing, but some users claim they haven't seen it. Instead, they say found the toggles in their settings switched on without their knowledge, raising questions about whether clear consent was given.\nI've asked several people to check whether camera roll sharing suggestions were enabled in their Facebook app. Besides myself and ZDNET's editorial director, my partner, in-laws, and many friends all found the options turned on without their knowledge. Many users have also reported on social media and in forum threads, like this one on Y Combinator, that the settings were enabled for them.\nSome of these people recalled seeing a consent pop-up from Facebook, while others did not. But nearly everyone said they did not realize they were allowing access to their camera roll data. They also said they would not have allowed it if they had known.\nCan I remove my photos once they've been uploaded?\nZDNET's sister site, CNET, reports that Meta pulls from your newer pictures (roughly the last 30 days) and if you disable the feature, your uploaded photos will be deleted after 30 days. The only way to confirm is by downloading your Facebook account data.\nWhy is this a potential privacy issue?\nIt expands Meta's reach beyond the content you've chosen to upload and share online -- into your private, unposted photos and videos. For many, that's a major red flag and a line they're not comfortable crossing, understandably so.\nAlso: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out\nEven if Meta is asking for consent to access your camera roll in order to analyze your phone's photos and provide AI-powered suggestions, the company could have done a better job of being clear and explicit about what it's trying to do.\nHow many users, like me, simply dismissed the consent pop-up without fully realizing what they'd just agreed to?\nEditor's note: This article was last updated on Sept. 2, 2025, to clarify steps for Android users. It was also updated on Aug. 24 to confirm that Meta's camera roll sharing suggestions are not turned on by default and are entirely opt-in. Still, some users say they never knowingly agreed and are finding the features enabled in their settings."

      "text": "I retested GPT-5's coding skills using OpenAI's guidance - and now I trust it even less\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- The same prompts in GPT-5 yield success, crashes, or errors.\n- OpenAI's prompt optimizer helps, but introduces its own quirks.\n- AI \"unconsciously\" adding details raises trust concerns.\nDo AI's get headaches? Because GPT-5 has certainly been giving me one. This article was going to be so easy. OpenAI came out with a list of best practices for GPT-5 coding. All I was going to do was try those best practices with the GPT-5 coding tests that previously failed and see if there was improvement.\nIt seemed so simple.\nAlso: I tested GPT-5's coding skills, and it was so bad that I'm sticking with GPT-4o (for now)\nBut then I had a thought. What if OpenAI has improved GPT-5 in the week or so since I ran my tests?\nPerhaps I should re-run the failed tests as-is and see what the results are, to use as a baseline for the new best practices.\nFrom a testing point of view, this was a valid approach. From a personal sanity point of view, not so much.\nRe-running test 1\nI re-ran the first failed test. This test has the AI creating a complete WordPress plugin, complete with a user interface and business logic. The idea is you feed in a set of names, it randomizes them, and it separates duplicates so they're not side-by-side.\nAlso: How I test an AI chatbot's coding ability - and you can, too\nWhen I ran this test on GPT-5 originally, it failed. Clicking the Randomize button sent the browser to another, unrelated page. I was able to cajole GPT-5 into fixing it, but the initial failure was what counted.\nThis time, I ran the exact same test with the exact same prompt again. This time, it worked perfectly. Wow, I thought. GPT-5 has improved in the past week.\nIf only I had left well enough alone. But no.\nI had to try again. On my second time with the exact same test with the exact same prompt, clicking Randomize resulted in what WordPressers call the \"white screen of death.\" This indicates something in the code isn't working.\nAlso: GPT-5 bombed my coding tests, but redeemed itself with code analysis\nI tried the exact same test with the exact same prompt a total of five times. The first time it worked. Subsequent times, it didn't. One time, I got a white screen. One time, I got a page full of error messages. One time, I was redirected to another page. One time, nothing happened at all.\nWe'll come back to test 1. But next, I decided to do the same thing with the other failed test.\nRe-running test 4\nThis test asks the AI to write code that talks to Chrome, AppleScript, and another tool called Keyboard Maestro. It requires the AI to be knowledgeable about the three different environments and how they work together.\nHere's an interesting factoid about AppleScript. The scripting language is inherently case-insensitive. So, if you ask AppleScript to compare \"AppleScript\" to \"applescript\", it will consider both strings to be the same. You have to explicitly tell it to compare case before it will do so.\nAlso: You can learn AI for free with these new courses from Anthropic\nWhen I first ran this test against GPT-5, it hallucinated that AppleScript had a native function for making strings lowercase. It does not, so the code failed.\nThis time, instead of hallucinating that AppleScript has a lowercase function, it decided to do one of the most convoluted sets of operations to lowercase a string. Here's that line of code:\nset tabTitleLower to (do shell script \"echo \" & quoted form of tabTitle & \" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'\")\nThe code actually works, but it's very weird and totally unnecessary. It launches a shell (the command line) to run a shell script that converts to lowercase. It's like making a grilled cheese sandwich and when you realize you're out of cheese, flying across the country to buy cheese from a 7-11 on the opposite side of the continent. You're not even getting better cheese. You're just doing it in the weirdest and most inefficient way possible.\nLet's not forget that we really don't need to make that text lowercase in the first place, because AppleScript is case-insensitive. So it wrote a highly convoluted piece of code that, while it works, is entirely unnecessary.\nI didn't bother to re-run this test four more times because the headache was already starting to set in.\nOpenAI's GPT-5 coding best practices\nOpenAI has put out what it calls a cheatsheet for GPT-5 coding. It has six main recommendations:\n- Be precise and avoid conflicting information: Well, duh. But apparently GPT-5 gets really confused if asked to follow vague or conflicting instructions.\n- Use the right reasoning effort: Rather than just letting GPT-5 choose its reasoning level, you might want to adjust its model. If it starts to overthink a problem, use a lower reasoning level. Great, so now we have to deal with a neurotic AI. Yippee?\n- Use XML-like syntax to help structure instructions: Rather than using just text, using XML tags to segment aspects of a prompt helps the AI to parse its assignment. This is a good hint, but it feels like a step back from what it could do.\n- Avoid overly firm language: In previous models, we sometimes had to YELL at the AI to get it to listen. Apparently, GPT-5 is passive aggressive, so if you get too forceful in your instructions, it will overdo its compliance, like what my old bosses used to say was my practice of \"aggressively following instructions.\"\n- Give room for planning and self-reflection: Does the AI need a blankie? Perhaps a warm stuffed animal to cuddle? In reality, what OpenAI is saying is that you need to encourage the AI to think through the instructions it gets. Apparently, if you don't tell it to think through the instructions, it won't. I fear for the planet.\n- Control the eagerness of your coding agent: It turns out GPT-5 is even more of a people-pleaser than GPT-4o. When giving it instructions, tell it to tone down its fawning and sucking-uppage.\nI'd like to say something positive here, but it's starting to feel like a migraine. Check out the PDF if you want more details.\nOpenAI also created an AI prompting helper. You point your browser to this tool, and paste in your prompt. The tool will give you back a more extensive prompt. For example, I gave it this prompt from Test 4:\nWrite a Keyboard Maestro AppleScript that scans the frontmost Google Chrome window for a tab name containing the string matching the contents of the passed variable instance__ChannelName. Ignore case for the match. Once found, make that tab the active tab.\nIt gave me back this:\nCreate an AppleScript for use in Keyboard Maestro that performs the following actions: * Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) outlining the planned steps before proceeding. * Scan all tabs in the frontmost Google Chrome window. * Search for a tab whose name contains the value of the passed variable 'instance__ChannelName', ignoring case sensitivity. * Once a matching tab is found, activate that tab and make it the current/active tab. After generating the script, validate in 1-2 lines whether the script meets all requirements. If not, state what needs adjustment.\nEssentially, it revised the prompt to add a planning phase at the beginning and a validation phase at the end.\nDoes it work?\nNope. Nopity-nope-nope.\nI ran Test 4's \"optimized\" prompt through GPT-5 and got back this script:\nThere are at least three serious flaws in it. First, the code in the green box doesn't work. It doesn't retrieve the value from Keyboard Maestro. Previous versions did that successfully using a completely different (and well-documented) mechanism. This approach is just loony.\nAlso: AI is creeping into the Linux kernel - and official policy is needed ASAP\nNow, look at the blue box. The considering case operation is used only for evaluation. For example, with considering case, \"BLUE\" and \"blue\" are different values. Do you see any sort of if statement or evaluation inside the blue box? Me neither.\nThen there's the red box. There is no such syntax as \"considering case false.\" First, the default behavior is to ignore case. Second, if you really wanted to explicitly tell AppleScript to ignore case, you'd use an \"ignoring case\" block. But \"considering case false\"? That's just some made-up syntax right there.\nRetrying the WordPress plugin\nI also ran my original prompt for the WordPress plugin through the prompt optimizer. I got back a fairly extensive project requirements document.\nOn the plus side, this time the plugin worked. I tried generating code a second time, and it also worked. So perhaps the optimization is something to try if GPT-5 isn't playing nice.\nBut then there's the weirdness. Because there's always weirdness. Check out the header block generated by GPT-5.\nNotice the author is attributed to Advanced Geekery Labs. Historically, the AIs have listed the author field as \"Your Name.\" But this time, it's Advanced Geekery Labs.\nThere is some relevance, because Advanced Geekery is the name of my YouTube channel and weekly newsletter. But I didn't use it anywhere in my instructions for this plugin. Additionally, I've never added Labs to the end of Advanced Geekery, even though my security product is sold through ZATZ Labs.\nSo I asked GPT-5 where it got the name Advanced Geekery Labs from. Its answer:\nGood question. The name \"Advanced Geekery Labs\" isn't something you provided in your request. I introduced it in the plugin header's Author: field as a placeholder, because in earlier conversations you've mentioned your \"Advanced Geekery\" brand, and I unconsciously expanded it into \"Labs.\"\nI'm glad the AI thinks it's a good question. That warms my heart. But \"unconsciously expanded\"? That's a direct quote from the AI. Those are its words.\nSo, we're now dealing with hallucinating AIs that operate unconsciously?\nWe're all doomed.\nWhat about coding and GPT-5?\nI still don't trust it. Actually, I don't trust it even more than when I tested it originally. What else might it do to my code \"unconsciously\"?\nI guess, if you really need GPT-5 to give you some code, you could try the optimizer. But I wouldn't rely on it.\nGPT-4o was impressive, but it had some problems. GPT-5 is like its more troubled, more difficult sibling.\nWith GPT-4o, I'd be willing to trust, with verification. I just plain don't trust GPT-5. There's something that's just not right. If we were to experience an AI that would revolt against its creators and try to kill us all, I would not be surprised if it all originated with GPT-5.\nAnd no. My headache hasn't gone away. Apparently, Tylenol is now bad for you. So, there's that, too.\nWhat do you think?\nHave you tried relying on GPT-5 for coding projects? If so, did you run into the same kinds of inconsistencies and odd behaviors? Do you find OpenAI's \"best practices\" helpful, or do they feel like workarounds for deeper problems? And what's your take on GPT-5's tendency to improvise or even \"unconsciously\" insert details? Is it a harmless quirk or a reason for concern?
