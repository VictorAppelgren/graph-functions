      "feedback": "Strong start, but to reach world-class multi-year rigor you should (1) replace the ad-hoc narrative with a formal horizon map: state-of-the-world invariants (first-principles anchors like real-rate differentials, policy reaction functions, and inflation path) and then define explicit regimes (easing-driven growth, hawkish restraint, and external-shock/geo-political risk) with clear transition conditions and probabilities; (2) lay out a coherent causal chain from policy expectations to asset pricing and cross-asset flows, with a step-by-step transmission logic (rates expectations → discount rates → valuations → flows → risk appetite) and tie each link to the cited sources (GX057ADL7; 37UZC9X8I); (3) stop relying on near-term anecdotes alone and quantify: use the explicit numbers in sources (e.g., potential Sept cuts of 25–50bp, up to 150bp per year in the Bessent narrative; 10-year yield around 4.2–4.3%; dollar path; Tencent growth; IEA oversupply signal) and present them as ranges with scenario-based sensitivities; (4) expand the transmission channels to include FX, rates, equities (notably AI/tech cycles), and commodities, and connect Tencent/credit-cycle nuances and the energy-supply backdrop (IEA) to regime outcomes; (5) confront conflicts explicitly: explain how a dovish Jackson Hole read could contrast with a hawkish inflation signal, and why these imply a probabilistic, regime-weighted base case rather than a single narrative; (6) fix factual/mechanical inconsistencies (remove the implausible “IntelOrbis channels” framing and ensure all claims map to the listed sources); (7) attach citations to every substantive claim and ensure complete coverage of the critical sources (GX057ADL7 and 37UZC9X8I, with cross-checks against related material where relevant); (8) tighten structure for a world-class piece: one-page executive frame, a three-regime scenario (base, upside, downside) with explicit catalysts and invalidation points, a concise watchlist, and a clear, multi-year conclusion; (9) present a concise base-case alongside two alternate paths with explicit trigger thresholds and risk boundaries to avoid overconfidence; (10) improve readability and discipline: consistent terminology, shorter sentences, and a compact multi-section layout while preserving the horizon emphasis.
