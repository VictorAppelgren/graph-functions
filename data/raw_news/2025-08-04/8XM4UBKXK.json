  "title": "Home Loan Rates Improve for Borrowers: Today's Mortgage Rates on Aug. 4, 2025",
  "description": "Any drop in mortgage rates is good news for homebuyers, but rates still remain high compared to a few years ago.",
  "content": "Check out CNET Money's weekly mortgage rate forecast for a more in-depth look at what\u2019s next for Fed rate cuts, labor data and inflation.\n\nThe average 30-year fixed mortgage interest rate is 6.74% today, a decrease of -0.02% from seven days ago. The average rate for a 15-year fixed mortgage is 5.99%, which is an increase of 0.03% from the same time last week. To secure a lower mortgage interest rate, consider increasing your down payment, improving your credit score or purchasing mortgage points.\n\nMortgage rates have stayed high in 2025. Concerns about persistent inflation, threats of a global trade war and policy turbulence have created an uncertain economic outlook. In response, the Federal Reserve has adopted a wait-and-see approach and kept interest rates steady in 2025.\n\nFinancial markets largely expect the Fed to resume lowering rates in September, particularly if President Trump eases some of his aggressive tariff measures or if the labor market continues to deteriorate.\n\nProspective homebuyers shouldn\u2019t expect mortgage rates to become affordable overnight. While cheaper borrowing costs gradually trickle down to the housing market, the Fed doesn\u2019t directly set lenders' mortgage rates.\n\nIn today\u2019s unaffordable housing market, mortgage rates are just one piece of the puzzle. High home prices and skyrocketing homeownership expenses, like insurance and property taxes, are further compounding the pressure on prospective buyers. The possibility of a job-loss recession is also pushing many households to tighten their budgets and take on less financial risk.\n\nWhen mortgage rates start to fall, be ready to take advantage. Experts recommend shopping around and comparing multiple offers to get the lowest rate. Enter your information here to get a custom quote from one of CNET's partner lenders.\n\nAbout these rates: Bankrate's tool features rates from partner lenders that you can use when comparing multiple mortgage rates.\n\nAre mortgage rates considered high right now?\n\nMortgage rates have remained elevated, volleying between 6.5% and 7% for the past several months.\n\nMortgage rates are closely tied to the bond market, specifically the 10-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to investors\u2019 expectations for inflation, labor data, changes to monetary policy and global measures like tariffs.\n\n\"Rates could fall if inflation keeps cooling and the labor market softens,\" said Jeb Smith, licensed real estate agent and member of CNET Money's expert review board. \"On the other hand, tariffs could create new inflation pressure. Add in government deficits and increased bond supply, and that puts upward pressure on rates.\"\n\nEven as the Fed eventually starts to lower interest rates, experts warn of a lot more volatility in the market. As a result, homebuyers are being more patient and strategic about financing, comparing different loan types and planning ahead.\n\n\"Some are waiting, others are getting pre-approved now so they\u2019re ready to act if rates fall,\" said Smith.\n\nFor a look at mortgage rate movement in recent years, see the chart below.\n\nWill we see lower mortgage rates in 2025?\n\nWhile the housing market was expected to rebound in 2025, it has remained stagnant due to ongoing economic and political uncertainties. Median family income has not kept pace with the surge in housing costs, requiring many households to earn double or triple their salary to afford a modest home in some cities.\n\nMortgage rates would have to drop significantly, close to 6% or below, to drum up significant homebuying demand. But according to Smith, the more likely scenario is a slow and steady decline in borrowing costs. A return to the record-low rates, around 2-3%, we saw during the pandemic would only happen if the economy tipped into a severe recession.\n\nFannie Mae now expects rates around 6.5% by the end of 2025 and 6.1% by the end of 2026.\n\nNumerous risks could keep rates elevated. For instance, if tariffs cause inflation to reignite, which most experts and Fed officials expect, it could result in higher bond yields and fewer interest rate cuts by the central bank. Both would be bad for mortgage rates.\n\nWhich mortgage term and type should I pick?\n\nEach mortgage has a loan term, or payment schedule. The most common mortgage terms are 15 and 30 years, although 10-, 20- and 40-year mortgages also exist. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rate is set for the duration of the loan, offering stability. With an adjustable-rate mortgage, the interest rate is only fixed for a certain amount of time (commonly five, seven or 10 years), after which the rate adjusts annually based on the market. Fixed-rate mortgages are a better option if you plan to live in a home in the long term, but adjustable-rate mortgages may offer lower interest rates upfront.\n\nThe 30-year fixed-mortgage rate average is 6.74% today. A 30-year fixed mortgage is the most common loan term. It will often have a higher interest rate than a 15-year mortgage, but you\u2019ll have a lower monthly payment.\n\nToday, the average rate for a 15-year, fixed mortgage is 5.99%. Though you\u2019ll have a bigger monthly payment than a 30-year fixed mortgage, a 15-year loan usually comes with a lower interest rate, allowing you to pay less interest in the long run and pay off your mortgage sooner.\n\nA 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgage has an average rate of 5.99% today. You\u2019ll typically get a lower introductory interest rate with a 5/1 ARM in the first five years of the mortgage. But you could pay more after that period, depending on how the rate adjusts annually. If you plan to sell or refinance your house within five years, an ARM could be a good option.\n\nGetting a mortgage should always depend on your financial situation and long-term goals. The most important thing is to make a budget and try to stay within your means. CNET's mortgage calculator below can help homebuyers prepare for monthly mortgage payments.\n\nWhere can I find the best mortgage rates?\n\nThough mortgage rates and home prices are high, the housing market won\u2019t be unaffordable forever. It\u2019s always a good time to save for a down payment and improve your credit score to help you secure a competitive mortgage rate when the time is right.\n\u2022 Save for a bigger down payment: Though a 20% down payment isn\u2019t required, a larger upfront payment means taking out a smaller mortgage, which will help you save in interest.\n\u2022 Boost your credit score: You can qualify for a conventional mortgage with a 620 credit score, but a higher score of at least 740 will get you better rates.\n\u2022 Pay off debt: Experts recommend a debt-to-income ratio of 36% or less to help you qualify for the best rates. Not carrying other debt will put you in a better position to handle your monthly payments.\n\u2022 Research loans and assistance: Government-sponsored loans have more flexible borrowing requirements than conventional loans. Some government-sponsored or private programs can also help with your down payment and closing costs.\n\u2022 Shop around for lenders: Researching and comparing multiple loan offers from different lenders can help you secure the lowest mortgage rate for your situation.",

      "text": "For the past several months, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has sat between 6.5% and 7%. Prospective homebuyers shouldn't hold their breath for that to change anytime soon.\nOn July 30, the Federal Reserve is expected to keep borrowing rates the same at its fifth monetary policy meeting this year. Although the central bank doesn't directly dictate mortgage rates, its policy decisions indirectly influence consumer borrowing costs, including for mortgages, over the long term.\nMortgage rates, which are primarily tied to 10-year Treasury yields in the bond market, are also sensitive to other factors, including investor outlook for future Fed moves. Economists will be closely listening to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting remarks for any hints about rate cuts later this year.\n\"While the Fed isn't expected to cut rates, Powell's language will be crucial,\" said Logan Mohtashami, lead analyst at HousingWire.\nMarkets currently expect a Fed cut in September. If Powell indicates slow progress on inflation and ongoing economic uncertainty, that may keep the Fed in monitor mode this fall, and bond yields and mortgage rates could increase.\nUltimately, it's unlikely that mortgage rates will fall significantly outside the current range unless the economy slows significantly or unemployment increases sharply.\nAffordability challenges and elevated mortgage rates have kept the housing market frozen for several years. Even as the long-standing housing shortage eases in several local markets and gives those buyers improved negotiating power, the rest remain locked out by steep home prices.\nWhy is the Fed holding off on interest rate cuts?\nAfter inflation showed ongoing signs of slowing in late 2024, the Fed lowered rates three times, yet the picture is more complex this year.\nThe Fed is tasked with maintaining maximum employment and containing inflation. A sluggish economy typically warrants interest rate cuts to stimulate growth, but lowering rates too quickly could fuel price growth when inflation is still sticky.\nThough President Trump has pushed for the Fed to cut rates immediately, reducing rates prematurely, especially in response to political pressure, could exacerbate the problem. \"Markets might interpret such a move as a signal of diminished inflation discipline, pushing bond yields higher due to inflation concerns,\" said Kara Ng, senior economist at Zillow. \"Ironically, this could cause mortgage rates to rise, not fall, counteracting the intended stimulus.\"\nTariffs are also a wild card for the mortgage market and the broader economy. While assumed to be inflationary, they could be transitory and translate into a one-time price increase for goods and services.\n\"There is a widely held consensus among economists that the potential impact of the administration's tariff policies and economic growth are still unclear and more time is needed to see the full effect,\" said Selma Hepp, chief economist at Cotality. \"As a result, the Fed is adopting a 'wait-and-see' approach.\"\nMost analysts expect two Fed rate cuts this year, but with trade negotiations ongoing, it's still a toss-up, said Mohtashami.\nFollowing signs of slowing inflation in late 2024, the Fed implemented three interest rate cuts but has since adopted a more cautious wait-and-see approach this year. Policymakers have held interest rates steady amid market fluctuations, a stance it's expected to uphold at its Federal Open Market Committee meeting next week\nToday's complex economic picture presents a challenge for the Fed, which is tasked with maintaining maximum employment and containing inflation. The president has claimed that prices are low and the Fed should cut rates immediately. But tariffs, which are taxes on imported goods, are widely expected to drive up prices.\nWe're already starting to see the effects: In June, inflation ticked up to 2.7%. While lower than markets expected, price growth is still well above the Fed's annual target rate of 2%.\nAs a result, experts say the central bank has good reason to keep rate cuts on pause.\n\"Increased uncertainty about the inflation picture lessens the chances of a cut in rates by the Fed,\" said Keith Gumbinger, vice president at HSH.com. \"Greater inflation would argue against cutting rates, absent any significant deterioration in labor conditions.\"\nFewer interest rate cuts combined with the recently passed budget bill, which is expected to significantly boost government debt deficits, are likely to keep upward pressure on longer-term bond yields and mortgage rates. But Kushi notes that \"any changes, delays or confirmations around tariffs could swing investor sentiment and move yields.\"\nWhen will mortgage rates fall to 6%?\nEarlier mortgage projections had rates dropping to around 6% by the end of 2025. Now, mortgage rates are expected to dip only slightly. Fannie Mae's June Housing Forecast says the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage will reach 6.5% by year's end. The Mortgage Bankers Association expects rates to stay mostly flat around 6.7% this year.\nGenerally, housing market experts don't see home loan rates falling below 6% until late 2026 at the earliest. However, rising unemployment or negative growth could prompt a series of Fed cuts and lead to lower bond yields and mortgage rates.\nAt the same time, if cheaper mortgages result from an economic downturn, with households facing job losses, tighter budgets and financial instability, potential buyers could remain locked out. A recession isn't a foregone conclusion, but the risk of a slowdown remains, with joblessness on the rise.\nCan you get a lower mortgage rate?\nProspective buyers waiting for mortgage rates to drop may soon have to adjust to the \"higher for longer\" rate environment. Yet while market forces are out of your control, there are ways to make buying a home slightly more affordable. Last year, nearly half of all homebuyers secured a mortgage rate below 5%, according to Zillow.\nHere are some proven strategies that can help you save up to 1.5% on your mortgage rate.\n\ud83d\udcb0 Build your credit score. Your credit score will help determine whether you qualify for a mortgage and at what interest rate. A credit score of 740 or higher will help you qualify for a lower rate.\n\ud83d\udcb0 Save for a bigger down payment. A larger down payment allows you to take out a smaller mortgage and get a lower interest rate from your lender. If you can afford it, a down payment of at least 20% will also eliminate private mortgage insurance.\n\ud83d\udcb0 Shop for mortgage lenders. Comparing loan offers from multiple mortgage lenders can help you negotiate a better rate. Experts recommend getting at least two to three loan estimates from different lenders.\n\ud83d\udcb0 Consider mortgage points. You can get a lower mortgage rate by buying mortgage points, with each point costing 1% of the total loan amount. One mortgage point equals a 0.25% decrease in your mortgage rate."

      "text": "A 10-year fixed-rate mortgage is less common than other types of mortgages, but it has some unique advantages. Though your monthly payment will be high, the interest rates on 10-year mortgages are usually lower than what you can get on a 30-year fixed mortgage.\nIf you can afford the hefty monthly payments, you\u2019ll save a significant amount of money over the long term. That\u2019s because you will be paying off your home loan in a shorter amount of time (10 years compared with, say, 30 years), which cuts down how much interest you\u2019ll accrue.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about 10-year mortgages, how they work and how to find the lowest rate for your situation.\n10-year fixed-rate mortgage rate trends\nSince the start of 2022, average mortgage rates have consistently increased from the pandemic-era lows of around 3%. As of mid-February, average rates for 10-year fixed mortgages are around 6.5% -- that\u2019s lower than the average rates for 30-year fixed mortgages, which are hovering above 7%.\nThe main reasons behind today\u2019s high mortgage rates are inflation and a series of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve designed to rein in price growth. While mortgage rates have declined some in recent months, experts aren\u2019t anticipating any dramatic decreases in mortgage rates just yet.\nInstead, mortgage rates are projected to slowly come down a percentage over the course of 2024. For mortgage rates to fall even more will hinge on inflation, economic data and how quickly the Fed can start cutting interest rates.\nWe use information collected by Bankrate, which is owned by the same parent company as CNET, to track daily mortgage rate trends. The above table summarizes the average rates offered by lenders across the country.\nCurrent mortgage rates\n| Product | Interest rate |\n|---|---|\n| 30-year fixed-rate | 6.74% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate FHA | 6.70% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate VA | 6.73% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate jumbo | 6.74% |\n| 20-year fixed-rate | 6.51% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate | 5.99% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate jumbo | 6.14% |\n| 5/1 ARM | 5.99% |\n| 5/1 ARM jumbo | 6.20% |\n| 7/1 ARM | 6.25% |\n| 7/1 ARM jumbo | 6.22% |\n| 10/1 ARM | 6.54% |\n| 10-year fixed-rate | 6.14% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.88% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate FHA refinance | 6.95% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate VA refinance | 7.44% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate jumbo refinance | 6.80% |\n| 20-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.70% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.22% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate jumbo refinance | 6.27% |\n| 5/1 ARM refinance | 6.15% |\n| 5/1 ARM jumbo refinance | 6.18% |\n| 7/1 ARM refinance | 6.63% |\n| 7/1 ARM jumbo refinance | 6.15% |\n| 10/1 ARM refinance | 7.14% |\nWe use information collected by Bankrate to track daily mortgage rate trends. The above table summarizes the average rates offered by lenders across the country.\nWhat is a 10-year mortgage?\nA 10-year mortgage works exactly the same way as other kinds of mortgages, but instead of repaying your mortgage in 15 or 30 years, you\u2019ll repay it in 10 years. This might make sense when buying a home if you can afford larger monthly payments, want to save big on interest payments and don\u2019t want to spend decades carrying mortgage debt.\nWhile 10-year mortgages aren\u2019t that popular (90% of Americans opt for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage), the homebuying process is the same whether you opt for a 10-year or 30-year mortgage. You should expect to pay the same fees, including closing costs and origination fees.\nIt\u2019s important to speak with multiple lenders and do your research before choosing a home loan. Interviewing more than one lender will help you find the lowest rate and fees for your situation. The more lenders you gather information from, the better your chances of securing a lower rate.\nNote: A 10-year fixed rate mortgage is not to be confused with a 10-year adjustable-rate mortgage. A 10-year ARM offers you a fixed, teaser rate for the first 10 years of your home loan. After that, your rate will adjust either once or twice a year for the remainder of your loan -- often 20 years.\nPros of a 10-year mortgage\n- Lower interest rate: You pay a lower interest rate for a 10-year mortgage than other types of mortgages because the bank is taking less risk loaning you money over a shorter period.\n- Pay off your loan faster: You save tens of thousands of dollars over the life of your loan by paying it off faster because you\u2019ll cut down the total interest you pay overall.\n- Faster path to equity: Because of larger monthly payments, you'll own your home sooner than you would with longer mortgage terms.\nCons of a 10-year mortgage\n- High monthly payments: Monthly payments can be two to three times higher than on a 30-year mortgage due to the shorter loan term. That might be too expensive for many people to afford.\n- Harder to qualify: Since a 10-year mortgage comes with higher monthly payments than a loan spread out over more time, lenders will likely require you to have a higher income to show you can afford the payment.\n- May limit your price range: A home that\u2019s affordable with a 30-year mortgage may become prohibitively expensive with a 10-year mortgage. This is because the amount you can borrow is based on your debt-to-income ratio, or DTI, and the higher monthly payments that come with a 10-year loan will increase your DTI. Even with excellent credit, some homebuyers shopping in expensive markets may not have enough income to qualify for a 10-year loan.\n- Reduced savings: If you\u2019re allocating a larger portion of your monthly spending on a mortgage payment, it may curb your ability to pay off other debt and save money, which can be risky in the case of an emergency or if your financial situation changes.\nShould you get a 10-year mortgage?\nA 10-year mortgage is an excellent option for financing your home purchase if you want to pay as little interest as possible, but it\u2019s not the best choice for everyone. For many potential homeowners, a 10-year home loan simply isn't an affordable option.\nA 10-year mortgage makes the most sense if you satisfy the following conditions:\n- You can comfortably afford the larger payments\n- You want to pay less interest over the life of your loan\n- You want to pay your loan off faster and build your equity quickly\nTo get a good idea of what your monthly payment will look like with a 10-year mortgage, you can use CNET\u2019s mortgage calculator.\nHow to get the best 10-year mortgage rate\nRegardless of mortgage type, it\u2019s important to take time to compare multiple loan offers from different lenders. That way you can compare their rates and fees side by side and negotiate the lowest interest rate for your situation.\nBefore you do that, make sure your application is in the best possible shape. Having an excellent credit score and paying down debts will give you a better chance at qualifying for the lowest rates.\nYou can take steps to improve your credit by making on-time payments and staying below your credit limit.\nAlternatives to 10-year mortgages\nA 10-year mortgage may make sense if you can afford a larger monthly expense with room in your budget to navigate any unexpected expenses. But it won\u2019t make sense for everyone\u2019s financial situation. Here are some alternatives:\n- 30-year mortgage: A traditional 30-year mortgage lets homebuyers access financing for a more expensive home, spreading the monthly payments over three decades. While it takes longer to build equity, you\u2019ll be able to get into a house on a budget you can afford.\n- 15-year mortgage: A 15-year mortgage isn\u2019t all that different from a 10-year mortgage, except you have five more years to pay it off. You\u2019ll still benefit from a lower interest rate than a 30-year mortgage and pay less interest over the shorter term. If you can\u2019t reasonably afford a 10-year mortgage, a 15-year mortgage may be a good compromise.\n- Government-backed loan: If you don\u2019t qualify for a 10-year mortgage, consider programs that helps first-time homebuyers or lower-income buyers purchase a home, such as an FHA loan, which can require a down payment as small as 3.5% for qualified participants, or a USDA loan, which will accept a credit score as low as 640.\nHow do you qualify for a 10-year mortgage?\nDifferent types of mortgage have various eligibility criteria. In general, you\u2019ll have a better chance of being approved if you meet the following requirements:\n- Income: Because you pay off a 10-year mortgage much faster than a 30-year mortgage, you\u2019ll have significantly larger monthly payments. As a result, you\u2019ll need a higher income to qualify for the loan, though the specific amount will depend on the home price and size of your loan.\n- Credit score: You\u2019ll need a credit score of at least 620 to qualify for a conventional 10-year fixed mortgage. However, individual lenders may set their own, higher minimum credit score requirements.\n- Down payment: A 20% down payment is widely recommended, but not necessarily required. Most lenders will require you to have a minimum down payment of just 3%.\n- Other factors: Make sure you have all your financial documents like tax returns and pay stubs in order. Lenders will factor in every aspect of your financial life to determine whether or not to approve you for a loan.\nFAQs\nOver the life of the loan, a 10-year mortgage is less expensive than loans with longer terms. You should be able to get a lower interest rate and you\u2019ll pay less in interest, because you\u2019ll pay it off faster.\nAnything at or below the national average is generally considered a good mortgage rate. For a 10-year fixed-rate mortgage, the average rate is currently 6.44% as of Feb. 13, 2024, according to Bankrate.\nOther mortgage tools and resources\nYou can use CNET's mortgage calculator to help you determine how much house you can afford. CNET's mortgage calculator takes into account things like your monthly income, expenses and debt payments to give you an idea of what you can manage financially. Your mortgage rate will depend in part on those income factors, as well as your credit score and the ZIP code where you are looking to buy a house"

      "text": "For most prospective homebuyers, a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is the top choice compared to other types of home loans. It offers the appeal of lower monthly payments by stretching the loan over three decades, allowing more flexibility in your budget. You also get the predictability of a fixed interest rate, meaning your monthly payments will stay consistent over the course of your loan.\nHowever, longer-term loans tend to have higher interest rates than shorter-term loans. In the first half of 2025, average 30-year home loan rates fluctuated between 6.5% and 7%. Meanwhile, 15-year rates have averaged between 5.75% and 6.25%.\nI asked experts about the pros and cons of 30-year mortgages and the outlook for homebuyers in 2025. Here\u2019s what you should know.\nCurrent 30-year mortgage rate trends\nSoaring inflation and a series of Federal Reserve rate hikes drove mortgage rates to record highs in recent years. This, coupled with steep home prices and limited housing inventory, has made homeownership prohibitively expensive for millions.\nLast year, optimism grew among prospective homebuyers as the Fed began lowering interest rates. But mortgage rates aren't directly set by the central bank. Despite the Fed's rate reductions last year, mortgage rates increased immediately after.\nThe mortgage market responds to a complex mix of factors, like inflation, labor market trends, the bond market and geopolitical events. Right now, the biggest driver for rates is the uncertainty around federal government policies. Given still-strong economic data and ongoing inflation under the Trump administration, the Fed has postponed additional interest rate cuts so far this year.\nExperts warn that if the Fed holds off on further rate reductions until the fall or later, average 30-year fixed mortgage rates could stay above 6.5% for the foreseeable future.\nHow to get the best 30-year mortgage rate\nDeveloping a strong financial profile will help you get the best mortgage rate and term. Here are ways you can get a better mortgage rate:\nImprove your credit score: Mortgage lenders will often advertise low interest rates but those are only available for borrowers with excellent credit scores (740 and above). Paying bills on time, keeping your credit balances low and regularly checking your credit report for errors could help improve your score.\nSave for a larger down payment: The more money you put down upfront (ideally 20%), the less you'll need to borrow with a home loan. A larger down payment also makes you a less risky borrower in the eyes of a lender, which may help you qualify for a lower mortgage rate.\nCompare multiple loan offers: Experts recommend you get quotes from at least two or three different mortgage lenders, including banks, credit unions and online lenders. Rates and loan terms (like how much you pay in closing costs) can vary significantly between lenders.\nPros and cons of a 30-year mortgage\nPros\n- Lower monthly payments: Your monthly mortgage payments will be significantly lower than with a 15-year loan, offering more breathing room in your household budget.\n- You can take out a larger loan: Lower monthly payments might allow the lender to approve you for a larger loan so you can buy a bigger or more expensive house.\n- Less expensive path to homeownership: A conventional 30-year mortgage term with a lower monthly payment gives you more opportunities to find and buy a home. If you want to shorten the length of your loan term and build equity faster, you can pay more toward your principal every month.\nCons\n- Higher interest rate: Generally, the longer the term, the higher the interest rate.\n- It costs more in the long run: You'll pay more over the life of a 30-year loan compared with a 15-year loan due to interest.\n- Slower to build equity: The less principal you pay off each month, the longer it takes to build equity. It also means there is less equity available to you if you want to refinance or take out a home equity loan or home equity line of credit.\nHow to compare 30-year mortgage rates\nAlways look at multiple lenders. By comparison shopping, you're more likely to get a 30-year mortgage with a competitive interest rate, though the specifics will depend on your credit score and financial situation.\nWhen comparing quotes, make apples-to-apples comparisons. Make sure all the criteria match, including loan term, lender fees, points and interest rate. You shouldn't compare one quote that provides only an interest rate with another that includes an APR, which includes additional fees and costs.\nRegarding your credit, it's fine to submit multiple mortgage applications in a short time. The credit rating bureaus will recognize you're rate shopping, and though your credit score may absorb the impact of one hard credit check, it should be relatively minor.\nDifferent types of 30-year mortgages\nThere are many different types of 30-year mortgages. Here are the most common.\nThese loans are offered by private insurers.\nLoans with an interest rate that won\u2019t change over the life of the loan. Your payment will be the same every month.\nThough your interest rate might start low at an initial fixed rate, it can change periodically based on market conditions.\nThese loans accommodate amounts above the maximum allowed for a conventional loan.\nCurrent mortgage rates\n| Product | Interest rate |\n|---|---|\n| 30-year fixed-rate | 6.74% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate VA | 6.73% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate jumbo | 6.74% |\n| 20-year fixed-rate | 6.51% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate | 5.99% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate jumbo | 6.14% |\n| 5/1 ARM | 5.99% |\n| 5/1 ARM jumbo | 6.20% |\n| 7/1 ARM | 6.25% |\n| 7/1 ARM jumbo | 6.22% |\n| 10/1 ARM | 6.54% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate FHA | 6.70% |\n| 10-year fixed-rate | 6.14% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.88% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate FHA refinance | 6.95% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate VA refinance | 7.44% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate jumbo refinance | 6.80% |\n| 20-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.70% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.22% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate jumbo refinance | 6.27% |\n| 5/1 ARM refinance | 6.15% |\n| 5/1 ARM jumbo refinance | 6.18% |\n| 7/1 ARM refinance | 6.63% |\n| 7/1 ARM jumbo refinance | 6.15% |\n| 10/1 ARM refinance | 7.14% |\nWe use data collected by Bankrate to track daily mortgage rate trends. The above table summarizes the average rates offered by lenders across the country.\nFAQs\nIt\u2019s a loan you take out to buy a house that you pay back over 30 years. Most 30-year mortgages have a fixed rate that never changes, so you\u2019ll have the same monthly payment over the life of the loan. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to lock in the best rate possible when you apply for a mortgage.\nThough sometimes used interchangeably, these two terms are different. The interest rate is the percentage of a loan you\u2019ll pay to the lender in exchange for borrowing money. With a mortgage, your monthly payment includes interest due.\nThe annual percentage rate, however, is typically higher than an interest rate because it includes all the costs of borrowing money including fees, discount points and private mortgage insurance (if applicable). Learn more about the difference between interest rate and APR.\nMortgage rates fluctuate, so the lowest rate you see today might change by tomorrow. By comparing the rates of different lenders, you should be able to find a competitive rate based on your credit score and financial situation.\nYour credit score, debts, loan-to-value ratio and economic factors all play a role in determining your mortgage rate.\nYour credit score is one of the first things mortgage lenders will look at. You usually need a credit score of at least 740 to secure the lowest mortgage rates. Lenders will also scrutinize your debts and monthly expenses to make sure you can afford to pay your mortgage every month. Try to pay down any high-interest debt, such as credit cards, before applying for a home loan. Another factor is your loan-to-value ratio, which is calculated by dividing how much of the loan you still need to pay off by your home\u2019s value.\nIn addition, 30-year mortgage rates are determined by a number of economic factors outside a homebuyer\u2019s control, such as Federal Reserve policy, inflation and the job market.\nThe best way to find a low rate is to shop around with different mortgage lenders and see who offers you the best rate. You should talk to at least two or three lenders before making a decision. With online lending, you have more options to compare rates and find a lender you feel comfortable with.\nRefinancing is an option for people who have built up equity in their home by making consistent mortgage payments over the years. When you refinance your home loan, you\u2019re taking out a new loan at a better interest rate to replace your old mortgage.\nIf you\u2019ve had your mortgage for only a few years and have less than 20% equity in your home, the numbers may not work out in your favor. That\u2019s because if your loan-to-value ratio is too high, you\u2019ll only end up paying more interest over a longer period of time, defeating the purpose of refinancing."

      "text": "Thinking about refinancing your mortgage this year? You\u2019ll be swapping your existing home loan for a new one, typically to alter the interest rate or repayment schedule. Refinancing can be a smart financial move to cut your monthly payments, pay off your house faster or access cash from your home equity.\nWith mortgage rates staying high in 2025, finding a significantly lower rate than what you already have (especially if it\u2019s below 6%) might not be in the cards for most homeowners.\nStill, if you want to adjust your loan term or switch to a different type of mortgage (like from an adjustable rate to a fixed rate), refinancing could be a worthwhile option. It all depends on your personal circumstances and financial goals.\nCurrent refinance interest rate trends\nAfter a series of interest rate hikes since 2022, which indirectly pushed mortgage rates up, the Federal Reserve reversed course and lowered borrowing rates late last year. Refinance rates were expected to slowly ease as the Fed made additional interest rate reductions, potentially opening up the refinancing market. Instead, refinance rates have stayed high.\nMortgage rates are influenced by a mix of economic factors, including the bond market, investors' sentiment, inflation and job numbers. Even though the Fed doesn't directly control mortgages, home loan rates often move based on what the Fed might do next.\nGiven the uncertainty around the Trump administration's potential for policies that could increase inflation, like tariffs and tax cuts, the Fed has paused further rate cuts.\nIf borrowing rates stay put for a while, experts suggest mortgage refinance rates could remain above 6.5% for some time. However, the economic picture can change quickly. If unemployment rises or inflation slows down, the Fed might resume lowering rates, and mortgage rates could start to fall.\nCurrent mortgage refinance rates\n| Product | Interest rate |\n|---|---|\n| 30-year fixed-rate | 6.74% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate FHA | 6.70% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate VA | 6.73% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate jumbo | 6.74% |\n| 20-year fixed-rate | 6.51% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate | 5.99% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate jumbo | 6.14% |\n| 5/1 ARM | 5.99% |\n| 5/1 ARM jumbo | 6.20% |\n| 7/1 ARM | 6.25% |\n| 7/1 ARM jumbo | 6.22% |\n| 10/1 ARM | 6.54% |\n| 10-year fixed-rate | 6.14% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.88% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate FHA refinance | 6.95% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate VA refinance | 7.44% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate jumbo refinance | 6.80% |\n| 20-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.70% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.22% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate jumbo refinance | 6.27% |\n| 5/1 ARM refinance | 6.15% |\n| 5/1 ARM jumbo refinance | 6.18% |\n| 7/1 ARM refinance | 6.63% |\n| 7/1 ARM jumbo refinance | 6.15% |\n| 10/1 ARM refinance | 7.14% |\nWe use information collected by Bankrate to track daily mortgage rate trends. The above table summarizes the average rates offered by lenders across the country.\nWhat is refinancing?\nWhen you refinance your mortgage, you pay off your existing mortgage with a new home loan that comes with new rates and terms. If you secured your existing mortgage when interest rates were higher than they are today, refinancing at a lower rate can save you money on your monthly payment or allow you to pay off the loan faster (and sometimes both).\nReasons to consider refinancing\nThere are many good reasons to refinance when conditions are right. Some of the most common scenarios include:\n- Reduce your monthly payments: Switching to a new loan with a lower interest rate or longer repayment term can reduce your monthly mortgage payment. The amount you'll save each month depends on the size of your mortgage and how much lower the new interest rate is compared to your previous loan. Most experts recommend refinancing if you can reduce your interest rate by 0.75%.\n- Pay off your mortgage sooner: If your original mortgage was a 30-year loan, you could refinance to pay it off sooner. With a lower interest rate, you may be able to switch to a 15-year loan and still have a manageable monthly payment. Reducing the length of the mortgage also lowers the total amount of interest you\u2019ll pay over the life of the loan.\n- Getting cash out of your home: With a cash-out refinance, you apply for a new loan that\u2019s larger than what you owe on your old loan -- and take the difference as a cash payment. Many homeowners use a cash-out refinance to pay for home improvements.\n- Switch to a fixed-rate loan: If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage, switching to a fixed-rate loan could be a good move. Refinancing can help you reduce future risk, according to Jason Fink, a professor of finance at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia. Locking in a fixed-rate mortgage provides predictability and protection from future rate increases.\n- Eliminate private mortgage insurance: Most loans require private mortgage insurance if you put less than 20% down when buying a home. As home prices have increased, you may have crossed the 20% equity threshold, creating an opportunity for you to refinance without PMI. (You can also ask your current lender to eliminate the PMI without refinancing.)\nReasons to not refinance\n- Fees are too high: While refinancing can save money in the long run, you\u2019ll need to pay upfront closing costs that can add up to thousands of dollars.\n- Interest rates are higher: If the interest rates have increased and your repayment term is the same, your payments will increase and you won\u2019t save money.\n- You\u2019re planning on moving soon: It could take a few years to recoup your refinance fees. If you expect to move in a few years, the trouble and expense of refinancing now might not make sense.\n- You\u2019re nearly finished paying off your mortgage: Mortgages are designed so that your highest interest payments come during the early years. The longer you\u2019ve had the mortgage, the more your monthly payment goes to paying off the principal. If you refinance later in the loan term, you\u2019ll revert to primarily paying interest instead of building equity.\nDifferent types of refinancing\nThere are a few different options for refinancing a mortgage. Here's a breakdown of some of the different ways to replace your current home loan:\nA rate-and-term refinance replaces your mortgage with a new rate and/or term with one of two goals: save money or pay off the loan faster. For example, you might decide to refinance a 30-year mortgage with a 7.5% interest rate with a new 30-year mortgage with a 6.5% interest rate to reduce your interest charges. Or you might have 20 years left on a 30-year mortgage and opt to refinance to a 15-year mortgage \u2014 ideally with a lower interest rate \u2014 to accelerate your payoff timeline.\nA cash-out refinance replaces your existing mortgage with a new loan that\u2019s worth more than your current loan. The goal with a cash-out refinance is to tap into your home equity and borrow cash at a lower rate to cover a major expense such as remodeling your kitchen or paying for college.\nIf you have a mortgage backed by the FHA or the VA, you may be able to qualify for a streamlined refinance. This \u201cstreamlines\u201d the process by eliminating some of the additional paperwork involved, including a new home appraisal or proof of income documentation. VA streamline refinances are commonly known as a VA IRRRL, or Interest Rate Reduction Refinance Loan.\nHow to get the best refi rate\nGetting the lowest refinance rate available is similar to getting the lowest rate possible on a new purchase loan: It starts with your personal finances. Evaluate your credit report at least 30 days before you apply for a refinance. If there is any incorrect information, dispute it. Creditors have 30 days to confirm the accuracy of the information or remove it from your report. Removing inaccurate information can improve your credit score and possibly help you qualify for a lower interest rate.\nTaking steps to improve your credit, including paying off credit cards, can lower the risk associated with your new loan. It\u2019s also important to compare options from multiple lenders. In addition to scoring the lowest rate, shopping around can help you find options with lower fees to help save on your closing costs.\nHow to apply to refinance my home loan\n1. Get your credit in great shape: Conventional lenders will approve refinance applications with a credit score of 620 or higher, the best rates go to borrowers with scores of 740 or higher.\n2. Figure out how much home equity you have: How much is your house worth, and how much money do you still owe on your current mortgage? The difference is your home equity. Simply put, the higher your equity, the better you\u2019ll look in the eyes of a lender.\n3. Compare multiple offers: You don't have to refinance your mortgage with your current lender \u2014 although it\u2019s worth starting with them to see what they can offer. Some lenders will waive certain fees for current borrowers who want to refinance. Make sure you compare other options. Comparison shopping is the key to saving money, whether you're shopping for groceries or a new mortgage.\n4. Lock your rate: Rates have increased substantially since the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates, so it's important to lock in a rate once you find one that suits your needs. If you don't, you could wind up paying more. Make sure you ask about a float-down rate lock, which lets you take advantage of lower interest rates if they become available.\n5. Communicate: Once you settle on a lender, it's important to be responsive to requests for financial documentation. The faster you respond, the faster you'll be able to close on the new loan, and the faster you'll be able to start saving money with your lower rate.\nFAQs\nYou don\u2019t need to refinance with the same lender as your original mortgage, although it could be a good option if speed and convenience are important to you. Start by contacting them to see what refinance options they offer. To prioritize getting the lowest rate, try shopping around for a different lender and compare at least two different loan offers. If another lender offers you a better rate, you can go with them or use the quotes to negotiate a better rate with your current lender.\nThere may be a slight difference between average refinance rates and average rates for purchase loans (the initial mortgage taken out on the home). The bigger difference between buying a new home and refinancing your current mortgage tends to be with the closing costs. The closing costs for refinances are lower, averaging less than 1% of the total loan amount. There are some exceptions in New York, Pennsylvania and Delaware, where closing costs are significantly higher.\nRefinancing involves paying closing costs, although the costs tend to be lower than with a new purchase loan. You should expect to pay 2% to 5% of the total mortgage value depending on the size of the loan, although you may be able to roll closing costs into your loan balance. In 2021, the average closing costs to refinance a mortgage for a single-family home added up to $2,375, according to data from ClosingCorp. That figure doesn\u2019t include any local taxes, which can add thousands in certain parts of the country.\nTo figure out if refinancing makes financial sense, you need to determine your break-even point, i.e., when your projected savings are greater than the costs associated with refinancing the loan. This ultimately comes down to how long you plan to live in the home. For example, if you\u2019re going to pay $6,000 to refinance your mortgage for a lower rate, you\u2019ll need to determine if you\u2019ll be in the home long enough for the total monthly savings to add up to more than $6,000."

      "text": "If you\u2019re looking to pay off your home loan faster and save money on interest, a 15-year mortgage might be a good fit. Though the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is more common among first-time homebuyers, a 15-year loan allows you to build equity quicker and typically comes with a lower interest rate.\nSo far this year, 30-year fixed rates have held between 6.5% and 7%, while 15-year mortgages have hovered between 5.75% and 6.25%. If the Federal Reserve cuts borrowing rates again this year, we might see a slight easing of 15-year mortgage rates, moving closer to 5.5% by the end of the year.\nThe main trade-off with a shorter loan term is higher monthly payments since you\u2019re condensing the repayment period into half the time. As with any major debt you plan to take on, assess your budget carefully to make sure the larger payments are manageable.\nWe\u2019ll explain 15-year mortgages, including current rates and trends, to help you make an informed decision.\nCurrent 15-year mortgage rate trends\nAfter falling to historic lows under 3% during the COVID-19 pandemic, mortgage rates more than doubled in 2022. The surge was due to a combination of high inflation and a series of interest rate hikes by the central bank. So far in 2025, 15-year mortgage rates continue to hover around 6%.\nAfter making three interest rate reductions late last year, the Fed has held off on further cuts this year due to immense economic and political uncertainty. While the central bank doesn\u2019t directly set mortgage rates, its policy decisions and outlook for the economy influence the direction of borrowing costs across the economy, including for home loans.\nIn addition to the Fed\u2019s policies, mortgage rates are particularly influenced by the bond market and investor sentiment. For home loan rates to fall consistently, experts say there needs to be a combination of weaker economic data as well as multiple rate cuts by the central bank over the coming months.\nCurrent mortgage rates\n| Product | Interest rate |\n|---|---|\n| 30-year fixed-rate | 6.74% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate FHA | 6.70% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate VA | 6.73% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate jumbo | 6.74% |\n| 20-year fixed-rate | 6.51% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate | 5.99% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate jumbo | 6.14% |\n| 5/1 ARM | 5.99% |\n| 5/1 ARM jumbo | 6.20% |\n| 7/1 ARM | 6.25% |\n| 7/1 ARM jumbo | 6.22% |\n| 10/1 ARM | 6.54% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.88% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate FHA refinance | 6.95% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate VA refinance | 7.44% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate jumbo refinance | 6.80% |\n| 20-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.70% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.22% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate jumbo refinance | 6.27% |\n| 5/1 ARM refinance | 6.15% |\n| 5/1 ARM jumbo refinance | 6.18% |\n| 7/1 ARM refinance | 6.63% |\n| 7/1 ARM jumbo refinance | 6.15% |\n| 10/1 ARM refinance | 7.14% |\nWe use information collected by Bankrate to track daily mortgage rate trends. The above table summarizes the average rates offered by lenders across the country.\nWhat is a 15-year fixed mortgage?\nA 15-year fixed mortgage is a loan you use to buy a house that you\u2019ll pay off over 15 years with a set interest rate. Because it has a shorter term than a mortgage loan with a 30-year term, the monthly payments are higher than with a fixed 30-year loan.\n15-year mortgage vs. 30-year mortgage\nThe main difference between a 15-year mortgage and a 30-year mortgage is that a 15-year mortgage will ultimately cost you less since you\u2019ll have a lower interest rate and pay considerably less in interest over the lifetime of the loan. But paying off the loan in a shorter amount of time means your monthly payments can be almost double what they are for a 30-year loan.\nThe pros of a 15-year fixed mortgage\n- Shorter loan term: A 15-year fixed mortgage takes half the length of time to pay off compared with a 30-year mortgage. You\u2019ll have higher monthly payments, but you\u2019ll pay this home loan off twice as fast, resulting in less interest over time.\n- Lower interest rates: Usually, 15-year fixed mortgages have lower interest rates than 30-year fixed mortgages. This is partly because you\u2019re paying back your lender sooner than with a longer-term loan, which means less risk for your lender.\n- Build equity in your home much faster: A 15-year fixed mortgage allows you to build more equity in your home faster than with a longer-term mortgage. This means you can enjoy some of the advantages of homeownership, such as refinancing your home loan or tapping into your home equity for financing options.\nThe cons of a 15-year fixed mortgage\n- Higher monthly payments: One downside to a 15-year mortgage is that you\u2019re stuck with high monthly payments for the duration of the home loan. If you make a 20% down payment on a $500,000 mortgage at a 7% interest rate with a 15-year fixed mortgage, your monthly payment will be about $3,994, compared to $3,060 with a 30-year fixed mortgage.\n- The maximum mortgage amount you can borrow is smaller: Because you\u2019re making high payments every month, lenders could offer you a smaller mortgage amount than they might with a 30-year loan. This reduces the risk to the lender that you will default on the loan.\n- Less financial flexibility overall: If you commit to a 15-year mortgage with a high monthly payment, it could limit your ability to afford other expenses. It means you may have less money to contribute to investment or retirement accounts, or a smaller financial cushion to fall back on if you run into difficulties.\nIs it worth refinancing to a 15-year mortgage?\nThe main reasons people choose to refinance their home loans are to lower their interest rate or adjust the length of their loan term. Given today\u2019s high mortgage rates, you may not be able to secure a lower interest rate, but shortening your loan term can still help you save money.\nFor instance, if you refinance your 30-year mortgage to a 15-year mortgage, you\u2019ll end up with higher monthly payments but save on interest and build equity faster in the long run.\nBefore refinancing, consider your financial goals, how much you have left to pay on your mortgage and how long you plan to stay in one place. If you\u2019re almost done paying off your primary mortgage or plan to move in the next few years, refinancing to a 15-year mortgage may not offer much financial benefit.\nIf you like the idea of paying off your mortgage sooner, but you\u2019re worried about committing to higher monthly payments, there\u2019s an alternative. If you stick with a 30-year mortgage, see if you can make additional payments throughout the year, which will help shorten your loan term. This allows you to effectively pay off your 30-year mortgage sooner without locking yourself into the higher monthly payments that are attached to a 15-year mortgage.\nAlternatives to a 15-year mortgage\n- 30-year mortgage: If you\u2019re unable to afford the higher monthly payments with a 15-year mortgage, a 30-year mortgage is a good option. While you\u2019ll pay more in interest overall, the lower monthly payments can make purchasing a home more affordable.\n- 10-year mortgage: If you can afford the higher monthly payments that come with a 10-year mortgage, you\u2019ll save yourself five years of interest payments. However, you\u2019ll likely require a higher income and credit score to qualify.\n- Government-backed loan: If a 15-year mortgage doesn\u2019t work for your particular financial situation, you can also look into a government-backed loan like an FHA loan, VA loan or USDA loan, which will typically have much lower credit score requirements and often allow you to make a small down payment or no down payment at all.\nFAQs\nYou must be able to afford higher monthly payments to qualify for a 15-year loan. Your salary, credit score and debt-to-income ratio \u2014 that is, how much debt you carry each month divided by your monthly income before taxes \u2014 play a more substantial role in the eligibility process for a 15-year mortgage than for a 30-year mortgage. If you have high-interest debt you\u2019re trying to pay down, a lender will factor in those payments when considering if you should be approved for the loan.\nA good 15-year mortgage rate would generally be considered anything at or below the national average rate, which is currently around 6.5%, as of early 2025, according to Bankrate.\nMore mortgage tools and resources\nYou can use CNET's mortgage calculator to help determine how much you can afford for a house and work out how to manage financially. The tool takes into account your monthly income, expenses and debt payments. In addition to those factors, your mortgage rate will depend on your credit score and the zip code where you are looking to buy a house."

      "text": "If you\u2019re thinking about refinancing your mortgage, a 15-year fixed refinance can be a good option.\nDepending on your current loan term and interest rate, refinancing to a 15-year fixed refinance can be a cost-effective way to pay off your mortgage faster and save money on interest costs.\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about how 15-year fixed refinances work and how to find the best rates.\nCurrent 15-year refinance rates and trends\nMortgage refinance rates have been slowly falling since last November. As of early January, average 15-year fixed refinance rates are around 6.3%. Lower mortgage rates are good news for homeowners looking to refinance, but rates are still quite high compared to two years ago.\nDuring the pandemic, many homeowners refinanced their mortgages to take advantage of the historically low rates, which were at around 3%. But when inflation surged in 2022 and the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates in an effort to contain it, mortgage rates shot up.\nAs a result, refinancing has become a less attractive option as many homeowners don\u2019t want to give up their existing mortgage rates in exchange for today\u2019s higher rates. But inflation is now steadily cooling and the Fed is expected to begin cutting rates later this year. Those factors, combined with other economic indicators, should help mortgage rates trend downward. Most major housing authorities expect mortgage rates to move closer to 6% as the year progresses.\nWhat is a 15-year fixed-rate refinance?\nWith a 15-year fixed refinance, you take out a new home loan that replaces your current mortgage. You\u2019ll pay the loan off over 15 years at a fixed interest rate. If you\u2019re replacing a 30-year mortgage with a 15-year one, you can secure a lower interest rate, but the trade-off is higher monthly payments.\nRead more: Refinancing a Mortgage: How It Works\nPros of a 15-year fixed refinance\n- Lower interest rate: 15-year refinance loans have lower interest rates than 30-year refinances. This means you will pay significantly less in interest over the life of your loan.\n- Pay off your mortgage faster: If you currently have a 30-year mortgage, you can reduce the amount of time it takes to pay off your home loan with a 15-year refinance.\n- Long-term financial gain: While your monthly payments will increase, a shorter loan term offers you more financial flexibility in the long run by freeing up your cash flow years earlier. It also won\u2019t add years back onto your mortgage the same way refinancing with a 30-year loan would.\n- Build equity faster: If you\u2019re reducing your loan term by securing a 15-year refinance, you\u2019ll be able to build equity faster.\nCons of a 15-year fixed refinance\n- Higher monthly payments: Compared to a 30-year refinance, the monthly payments on a 15-year fixed refinance will be significantly higher.\n- High upfront costs: Additional expenses like closing costs and lender fees are also important to take into consideration when you refinance. Closing costs will run you anywhere between 2% to 6% of your loan.\nWhen does it make sense to refinance into a 15-year mortgage?\nMost people refinance to save money. Refinancing a longer-term loan, like a 30-year mortgage, into a 15-year mortgage will shave thousands off of what you\u2019ll pay in interest. If you can secure a lower interest rate than the one on your existing mortgage, you\u2019ll be able to save even more.\nThe general rule of thumb is that a refinance is a good idea if you can get an interest rate at least 1% lower than the one you already have. This is unlikely given today\u2019s high rates, but if you purchased a home recently and can take advantage of a lower rate now, that could be enough incentive to consider refinancing.\nOf course, there are other reasons to refinance. For example, if you want to switch from an adjustable rate mortgage to fixed-rate mortgage, tap into your home\u2019s equity with a cash-out refinance or take someone off your mortgage, a 15-year fixed refinance could be a good option.\nThe first consideration for a 15-year refinance is whether you can afford it. If you\u2019re moving from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year one, you\u2019re going to have higher monthly payments.\nFor example, if you have a 15-year loan on a $500,000 mortgage at a 6.5% interest rate, you\u2019ll have monthly payments of $4,355 and pay $285,996 in total interest over the life of your loan.\nA 30-year loan on the same mortgage would have a slightly higher interest rate, for example, 7%. In this scenario, you will have monthly payments of $3,326 and pay $697,544 total in interest over 30 years.\nNot only is that a massive difference in interest payments, but also more than a $1,000 difference in your monthly costs.\nConsider your break-even point\nRefinancing can potentially save you money, but it isn\u2019t free. So, it\u2019s important to consider your break-even point: the point when your savings outweigh the cost of refinancing.\nSince you take out an entirely new home loan when you refinance, you\u2019ll have to pay a new set of closing costs, which can range anywhere from 2% to 6% of your loan. If you\u2019re thinking about moving in the near future, it may not be financially beneficial to refinance your mortgage if you won\u2019t be there long enough to recoup the closing costs. A refinance break-even calculator can help you decide if refinancing makes sense.\nCurrent mortgage rates\n| Product | Interest rate |\n|---|---|\n| 30-year fixed-rate | 6.74% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate FHA | 6.70% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate VA | 6.73% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate jumbo | 6.74% |\n| 20-year fixed-rate | 6.51% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate | 5.99% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate jumbo | 6.14% |\n| 5/1 ARM | 5.99% |\n| 5/1 ARM jumbo | 6.20% |\n| 7/1 ARM | 6.25% |\n| 7/1 ARM jumbo | 6.22% |\n| 10/1 ARM | 6.54% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.88% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate FHA refinance | 6.95% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate VA refinance | 7.44% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate jumbo refinance | 6.80% |\n| 20-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.70% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.22% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate jumbo refinance | 6.27% |\n| 5/1 ARM refinance | 6.15% |\n| 5/1 ARM jumbo refinance | 6.18% |\n| 7/1 ARM refinance | 6.63% |\n| 7/1 ARM jumbo refinance | 6.15% |\n| 10/1 ARM refinance | 7.14% |\nWe use information collected by Bankrate to track daily mortgage rate trends. The above table summarizes the average rates offered by lenders across the country.\nFAQs\nA 15-year fixed refinance is a new home loan that replaces your current mortgage. The interest rate is fixed and you must pay the loan off within 15 years. If you are replacing a 30-year mortgage with a 15-year one, you can secure a lower interest rate, but the tradeoff is higher monthly payments. It\u2019s important to do your research and speak with multiple lenders to find the best 15-year mortgage refinance rate available to you.\nLenders determine your eligibility for a 15-year refinance using a number of factors, but a big one is your income. It\u2019s harder to qualify for a 15-year refinance than a longer-term loan because you need a higher income to afford the monthly payments. Lenders will also take into account other factors, such as your credit score and how much debt you\u2019re carrying.\nThe type of mortgage that\u2019s best for you depends on your individual financial circumstances. Generally speaking, though, if you can afford the monthly payments on a 15-year refinance, it has two main advantages compared to a 30-year refinance: You get a shorter loan term and lower interest rates, both of which could save you tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest payments over time.\nMore refinance tools and resources\nThe bottom line is that refinancing into a 15-year loan can help you pay off your mortgage faster and supply valuable cash flow in the long run. Paying off your mortgage in 15 years provides more flexibility in your budget later on for building up your retirement nest egg, and it'll allow you to retire without mortgage debt hanging over your head. When considering a refinance, always make sure to solicit and compare quotes from multiple lenders to find the lowest rates available to you, and ultimately get the most out of home ownership."

      "text": "In today's expensive housing market, it's not a mystery why someone making $100,000 a year would see homeownership as out of reach.\nWith more than two decades as a real estate professional, I tell my clients to be honest about what fits their financial reality, not just the bank's formulas. Unless you're buying a home with cash (unlikely), it's valid to ask if you can afford to take out a mortgage on an above-average salary.\nLet's start by making a key distinction. The amount you borrow for your home loan and the amount you qualify for are different. Although a lender may approve you for a large loan, that doesn't mean it's a smart financial move for your life or budget.\nThe key is understanding how much you can borrow, your monthly budget and home prices in your local market, not just nationally. You'll also need to understand debt-to-income ratios and what goes into your mortgage payment beyond your interest rate alone.\nGross salary vs. disposable income\nIf you earn $100,000 per year, that breaks down to $8,333 per month in gross income. Lenders will use your monthly gross income when calculating how much house you qualify for.\nThis figure doesn't reflect what you actually take home. Your net pay is closer to $6,561 per month, depending on your specific tax deductions and benefits.\nWhen budgeting for homeownership, look at your disposable income, i.e., the amount of money you have available for spending, saving or investing after all mandatory deductions and taxes have been subtracted.\nMortgage lenders don't factor in what you spend on groceries, child care or your car lease, either. Their math is entirely based on your gross pay, which can make your budget look stronger than it actually feels.\nWhat to know about a monthly mortgage payment\nA mortgage payment is more than just the loan. Lenders often refer to PITI, which stands for principal, interest, taxes and insurance. Many homes also include HOA fees.\nHere's what makes up your full monthly payment:\n\u2611\ufe0f Principal: The amount you're paying off each month toward your mortgage loan balance.\n\u2611\ufe0f Interest: The cost of borrowing, based on your mortgage interest rate. Average rates are currently in the 6.5% to 7% range and they're expected to be there for a while.\n\u2611\ufe0f Property Taxes: Depending on your location, a good estimate is between 1% and 1.5% of your home's value annually, divided into monthly payments.\n\u2611\ufe0f Homeowners insurance: Usually $100 to $150 per month, although this will vary a lot by region.\n\u2611\ufe0f Mortgage insurance: If you put down less than 20%, this can add up to a few hundred dollars per month based on your down payment, credit score and the number of borrowers on the loan.\n\u2611\ufe0f HOA Fees: Common in condos or planned communities, ranging from $100 to $500 or more.\nReal example: An initial calculation for a $2,000 monthly mortgage payment might actually be closer to $2,700 to $3,000 when everything else is factored in. Always run the full numbers, not just the loan payment.\nAffording a $400,000 home with a $100,000 salary\nOver the years as a realtor, I've worked with buyers of varying financial backgrounds who find ways to buy a home, even in an unaffordable market.\nMy main advice is to remember that no home-buying budget is ever the same. Each household has different needs, expenses and financial padding.\nAlways look at the full picture, including other expenses, before you take out a mortgage. If you're stretching with a low down payment or have debt already, consider a less expensive home or a more affordable location.\nIn these instances below, your housing expenses will be about 40% or 50% of your take-home pay. It may look safe on paper but in real life, you will have little left over for anything else. At the same time, this might be manageable for some buyers who have minimal debt, a second stream of income or additional savings.\nUnderstand your risk tolerance\nThe safest approach when purchasing a home is to borrow less than you qualify for.\nMany realtors recommend the 28/36 rule, a solid target for long-term financial stability. That means keeping your housing costs under 28% of your gross income and your total monthly debt under 36% of your gross income.\nWith $8,333 per month in gross income, that would cap your total monthly payment at $2,333.\nMore cautious buyers often follow the rule recommended by the personal finance author Dave Ramsey. Ramsey recommends keeping your mortgage at less than 25% of your take-home pay (not your gross income).\nLooking at your net salary of $6,561 per month, that would cap your total monthly payment at $1,640 -- a tough number to hit unless mortgage rates are low, you have a large down payment or are buying in a low-cost market.\nConventional mortgages vs. FHA loans\nMost first-time buyers use either a conventional loan or a Federal Housing Administration loan. The right option depends on your credit score, savings and long-term goals.\nConventional loans are best if you have good credit (typically 680 or higher) and can put down at least 5 to 20% upfront toward the home's purchase price. With a 20% down payment, you skip mortgage insurance and may qualify for a lower interest rate.\nFHA loans let you qualify for a mortgage and buy a home with as little as 3.5% down and with a credit score as low as 580. These government-backed loans often have more favorable average interest rates than conventional loans but you'll have more fees to pay. FHA mortgages allow higher debt-to-income ratios, which makes them more flexible if you're pushing your budget. The trade-off with an FHA loan is being stuck with mortgage insurance premiums unless you refinance later.\nBoth loan types are common if you're starting your homeownership journey. It just depends on your personal situation and how much you can realistically afford to pay off in monthly mortgage debt. With a smaller down payment, you'll be taking out a larger loan with more debt to pay off over the long term.\nDecide how much down payment you can afford\nYour down payment percentage has a direct impact on your loan, monthly payment and whether you'll need mortgage insurance. Let's take a more detailed look at what this would mean for a $400,000 home, which is less than the average home sales price in the US.\nDown payment on a $400,000 home:\n- FHA loan: 3.5% = $14,000 down payment\n- Conventional loan minimum: 5% = $20,000 down payment\n- Conventional without mortgage insurance: 20% = $80,000 down payment\nA 20% down payment means lower monthly payments, no mortgage insurance and less debt and interest paid over time. It also increases your odds of getting your offer accepted in a competitive market. But if putting 20% down drains your savings, that's not the best move either. You still need reserves for closing costs, maintenance and emergencies.\nDetermine your debt-to-income ratio\nDebt-to-income ratio, or DTI, is how lenders measure your ability to repay a loan. It's a simple formula: monthly debt payments divided by gross monthly income.\nTwo numbers matter. The front-end ratio is the percentage of your income that goes toward housing expenses only (mortgage payment, property taxes, insurance, etc.). The back-end ratio is the percentage that includes all monthly debts (from housing, credit cards, student loans, car payments, etc.).\nMost conventional loans allow up to 49.99% on the back-end ratio, although many lenders aim lower. FHA loans are more flexible, with lenders often allowing DTIs above 50% if your credit and income support it.\nKeep in mind that these are maximum limits. Just because you can borrow that much doesn't mean you should. A lower DTI gives you more breathing room in your monthly budget and can make life feel a lot less stressful after you move in.\nBuying a home with a $65K salary\nPurchasing a home with a lower salary is definitely riskier and harder for most people. Your options will be limited by loan size and monthly debt caps. In most cases, you'll need a large down payment, a second income or family support to make it work.\nIn more affordable regions, you can still buy modest homes or condos with help from FHA loans or grant programs. But in places like California or New York, homeownership options will be very restricted without assistance.\nPreparing for the housing market today\nWhile home prices may cool in some areas, a major drop is unlikely. Waiting for a price crash could mean missing out on the right home.\nHousing inventory is still below pre-pandemic levels, with current homeowners holding tight to their cheaper mortgage rates. Demand for homes remains strong, maintaining the supply/demand imbalance and keeping prices elevated.\nBefore you start home shopping, speak with a mortgage loan adviser. They'll help you understand exactly how much home you can afford based on your income, credit and debt. They'll also break down your full payment so there are no surprises.\nTaking out a mortgage is one of the biggest commitments you'll make. Getting the numbers right, especially in a high-priced market and an unpredictable economy, helps you prepare for the costs of homeownership and avoid regret."

      "text": "A jumbo mortgage is a loan used to buy a home that surpasses conventional loan limits, as set by the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\nFor 2025, the conventional loan limit for a mortgage is $806,500 for single-family homes or $1,209,750 in areas with higher home values, such as Alaska or Hawaii. If you\u2019re planning on borrowing more than that amount, you\u2019ll need a jumbo mortgage.\nJumbo loans generally have strict eligibility requirements. Lenders may require a credit score of at least 700, a large down payment (likely close to 20%) and a higher income.\nCurrent jumbo mortgage rate trends\nInterest rates for jumbo loans tend to trend in the same direction as conforming mortgage rates. In early 2022, mortgage rates began to surge as the Federal Reserve carried out a series of aggressive rate hikes to bring inflation down.\nIn recent months, jumbo mortgage rates have stayed high, ranging from 6.5% to 7.5%.\nNow that the Fed has started to reduce interest rates, homebuyers could see borrowing costs gradually fall. Depending on macroeconomic conditions and the Fed's monetary policy decisions, jumbo mortgage rates could move close to 6% by the end of 2025.\nCurrent mortgage rates\n| Product | Interest rate |\n|---|---|\n| 30-year fixed-rate | 6.74% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate FHA | 6.70% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate VA | 6.73% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate jumbo | 6.74% |\n| 20-year fixed-rate | 6.51% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate | 5.99% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate jumbo | 6.14% |\n| 5/1 ARM | 5.99% |\n| 5/1 ARM jumbo | 6.20% |\n| 7/1 ARM | 6.25% |\n| 7/1 ARM jumbo | 6.22% |\n| 10/1 ARM | 6.54% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.88% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate FHA refinance | 6.95% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate VA refinance | 7.44% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate jumbo refinance | 6.80% |\n| 20-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.70% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.22% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate jumbo refinance | 6.27% |\n| 5/1 ARM refinance | 6.15% |\n| 5/1 ARM jumbo refinance | 6.18% |\n| 7/1 ARM refinance | 6.63% |\n| 7/1 ARM jumbo refinance | 6.15% |\n| 10/1 ARM refinance | 7.14% |\nWe use information collected by Bankrate, to track daily mortgage rate trends. The above table summarizes the average rates offered by lenders across the country.\nThings to know about getting a jumbo mortgage\nCredit requirements are stricter for jumbo mortgages since they are larger loans that require bigger down payments. You typically need a minimum credit score of 700 to qualify for a jumbo loan, although the required score varies by lender -- some lenders will accept a score as low as 660.\nYou should also be prepared for a larger down payment with a jumbo loan: The minimum down payment requirement for a jumbo loan is 10%, compared with 3% for a conventional mortgage. In order to qualify for a jumbo loan, you need to have your financial documents ready to be evaluated by a lender.\n- Have your finances in order: Gather financial documents like your W-2, pay stubs and bank statements for proof of income to show lenders you can afford the loan.\n- Get prequalified: In order for a seller to take your offer seriously, you have to verify your creditworthiness by going through the prequalification process (or the preapproval process, which is a step further and is subject to a hard credit check and review of your financial records).\n- Have a strong credit score: Pay off high-interest debt like credit card debt to raise your credit score, and make sure your debt-to-income ratio is low overall.\n- Assemble a 10% down payment: At a minimum, you will be required to put down 10% for a jumbo loan.\nWho should get a jumbo mortgage?\nA jumbo mortgage could make sense if you satisfy one of the following requirements:\n- You\u2019re in an area with a high cost of living: Jumbo loans are prevalent in virtually every county in the US because it\u2019s simply based on the size of your loan. However, big cities and areas along the coasts can be particularly expensive and buying a home in one of those places could require a jumbo mortgage.\n- You have great credit: For a lender, a jumbo mortgage is a bigger risk compared to other types of mortgages, given that you\u2019re borrowing a larger amount of money. As such, it\u2019s essential to have a strong credit score as part of your application.\n- You don\u2019t have sufficient cash on hand: People typically take out a mortgage because they don\u2019t have enough cash to pay for a house out of pocket. A jumbo loan allows you to finance a more expensive home where you want to live.\nHow to compare jumbo rates\nGetting a sampling of rates for any type of loan is important, and you may see a range of offers from banks, credit unions and online institutions. Make sure that you\u2019re comparing apples to apples, however. Some lenders will use an annual percentage rate, or APR, and others may use an interest rate. Though related, they are different things: An APR provides a more complete snapshot of the costs associated with procuring a loan.\nWhy should you compare jumbo mortgage rates?\nJust as with any mortgage, shopping around with different lenders will help you secure the lowest rate possible. Comparing interest rates and fees between lenders allows you to see what the true cost of your loan will be. Getting quotes from numerous lenders will save you money: Interviewing just one additional lender can save you on average $1,500 over the lifetime of your loan, and speaking with five lenders can save you $3,000 on average over the course of your mortgage, according to Freddie Mac.\nHow to get a jumbo mortgage\n1. Check your credit. Your credit score is a significant factor in landing a jumbo loan because you\u2019re borrowing a large sum. Typically, an applicant would need a credit score of at least 700 to qualify, though specific score requirements vary by lender. Some lenders may accept a slightly lower score in certain situations.\n2. Prepare your down payment. The minimum down payment for a jumbo loan is 10% of the total cost of the home. That\u2019s significantly higher than a conventional mortgage, which usually requires a 3% down payment.\n3. Organize your documents. Any lender will want access to your bank statements, tax documents, pay stubs and other financial documents.\n4. Get preapproved. A mortgage preapproval will provide more information about how much home you can afford. It also signals to sellers that you\u2019re serious about making an offer.\n5. Find your home. With a preapproval in hand, you can start shopping for a home in earnest.\nFAQs\nYou should consider a jumbo mortgage if you need a loan larger than the FHFA limit for your area. In regions where housing prices are sky-high, the limits for a jumbo loan tend to be higher than lower-cost living areas.\nOverall, a loan is considered a jumbo loan if it exceeds $806,500 in 2025 . However, in more expensive counties in California and New York, the limit before having to apply for a jumbo loan is $1,209,750.\nJumbo loans require a higher minimum credit score than conventional loans. The minimum credit score for jumbo loans is usually around 700, though some lenders will accept 680, whereas a typical minimum credit score for a conforming 30-year loan is usually 620.\nThere are fixed-rate jumbo loans as well as adjustable-rate jumbo mortgages. Typically fixed-rate jumbo loans are offered in 15-year and 30-year terms, although it varies depending on the type of jumbo loan you take out. ARMs, for example, usually come in five-, seven- or 10-year terms. You can also refinance a jumbo loan, with a standard rate and term refinance or a cash-out refinance just like conventional loans.\nJumbo rates are set just like traditional rates, based in part on the rates set by the Federal Reserve and macroeconomic conditions. But your financial situation, including your credit score and income, will be a key factor in determining your specific rate.\nMore mortgage tools and resources\nYou can use CNET's mortgage calculator to help you determine how much house you can afford. The CNET mortgage calculator factors in variables like the size of your down payment, home price and interest rate to help you figure out how large of mortgage you may be able to afford. Using the CNET mortgage calculator can also help you understand how much of a difference even a slight increase in rates makes in how much interest you'll pay over the lifetime of your loan."

      "text": "If you're a prospective homebuyer considering an adjustable-rate mortgage, you're probably wading through a sea of different numbers: 5/1, 10/6, 7/1, 10/1, 7/6 and more. Adjustable-rate mortgages are less common and more complicated than fixed-rate mortgages, but they have one major advantage right now. The introductory rate is lower than the rate for the most common type of home loan, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages.\nBut that doesn't mean a 5/1 ARM is the best option for you. Read on to find out if the schedule and costs attached to this type of home loan match your needs.\nHow does a 5/1 ARM work?\nTo understand the basics of a 5/1 ARM, let's look at the numbers. The \"5\" represents the introductory period, meaning your initial rate will stay the same for the first five years from your closing date, and the \"1\" represents how frequently your rate will change, meaning every year. For example, if you take out a 5/1 ARM with a rate of 6.7% in December, that's the interest rate you'll have over the next 60 months until your rate and payment begin to change on an annual basis.\nAfter the five-year introductory period, the rate can go up or down, based on broader economic indicators, though there are limitations on how much the rate can increase. An ARM has periodic caps that restrict the amount it can go up in one year, and a lifetime cap that dictates how much it can increase over the entire loan term.\nWhat happens when a 5/1 ARM rate adjusts?\nAccording to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, you'll receive a notification approximately seven to eight months before your first rate adjustment and an estimate of your new monthly payment. In subsequent years, you'll receive a similar notification a bit closer to the adjustment, somewhere between two and four months before it kicks in.\nWhat index is used for a 5/1 ARM?\nIf you don't work in finance, you probably aren't thinking much about the indexes that lenders use for adjusting the rates on a 5/1 ARM, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate and the One-Year Treasury Constant Maturity. Lenders use that index, plus a margin, to set your rate. For example, if the Secured Overnight Financing Rate stood at 5.3% and your lender's margin was 2.25%, your rate would be 7.55%.\nHow does a 5/1 ARM compare to a fixed-rate mortgage?\nA 5/1 ARM will typically have a lower rate and a lower monthly payment for the first five years compared with a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. A 5/1 ARM can look more appealing to homebuyers because the introductory payments create extra room in your budget.\nPros and cons of a 5/1 ARM\nIf you're considering a 5/1 ARM, here's a rundown of the main upsides and downsides:\nPros:\n- Upfront savings: The biggest benefit of a 5/1 ARM is that your monthly payments during the introductory period will be more affordable than a fixed-rate mortgage.\n- Ability to afford a better house: Those cheaper monthly payments mean that you may be able to comfortably afford to buy a bigger house or one in a preferred location. However, lenders aren't going to relax their standards for an ARM versus a fixed-rate loan. You'll still need to demonstrate your ability to pay back the mortgage and to cover higher payments in the event of a future increase in your rate.\n- Potential for a decrease in your interest rate: There's no rule that rates are going to rise. Economic conditions could lead to a drop in your rate at some point during the adjustment period, creating a nice surprise for your budget.\nCons:\n- Uncertainty after five years: After those lower payments, it's tough to say what's in store in the sixth year and every year after that. If your payments go up and you can't move, you'll need to deal with more expensive housing costs.\n- More costs if you want to get out of the ARM: Though you can avoid letting that adjustment period kick in, keep in mind that it's going to cost you. You'll either need to deal with the pain of listing the house and moving, or you'll need to be prepared to refinance and pay thousands of dollars in closing costs for a new loan.\n- More confusion: When you review mortgage documents, you're going to look at a maze of terms and dates. With ARMs, you're going to look at a lot more complicated information about indexes, rate caps and margins. If you don't work in finance, these could make your head spin.\nShould you get a 5/1 ARM?\nIf you're trying to figure out if you should apply for a 5/1 ARM, consider three big questions:\n- How long are you planning to stay in the home? If you're confident you're going to sell the home in a relatively short period of time, a 5/1 ARM can be a great decision. For example, if you plan to sell within the first five years, you'll never need to worry about a rate adjustment. However, plans can also change. According to research from the National Association of Realtors, the median expected time in a home for first-time homebuyers is 18 years.\n- Will you be able to refinance into a fixed-rate mortgage in the future? There's no crystal ball for mortgage rates, so this one has no clear answer. However, Fannie Mae's data suggests that rates will begin to drop in the back half of next year and reach 6.3% in the closing quarter of 2024. One potential option is to take out a 5/1 ARM now and refinance into a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage when rates look favorable. You'll pay for closing costs again on the new mortgage, but you can avoid any of those adjustments and stay in your home.\n- Will you be able to afford higher payments down the road? Perhaps you're working an entry-level job now, and your money is tight. Your monthly earnings may look very different in five years, and a higher payment later may or may not create much stress on your finances. To get a better idea of how high the interest rate on a 5/1 ARM can go, take a look at the interest rate cap and see if it might give you trouble down the road.\nIn addition to considering these questions, you can research adjustable-rate mortgages to get a better sense of how they can impact your budget. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau offers a handbook that can empower you with knowledge about these loans.\nIs now a good time for a 5/1 ARM?\nIf you're trying to buy a home within the next year, a 5/1 ARM may improve your ability to do so. Fannie Mae expects rates on 30-year mortgages to stay above 6.6% through the halfway point of 2024. This means that introductory rates on adjustable-rate mortgages will be more attractive. In fact, data from early October from CNET sister site Bankrate shows that the average rate for a 5/1 ARM was nearly one percentage point lower than the average 30-year mortgage rate.\nFAQS\nWhat does a 5/1 ARM mean?\nThe first number, 5, represents the number of years when you'll have a fixed rate attached to the mortgage. The second number, 1, represents the frequency at which the rate will adjust after that introductory period of 5 years. A 5/1 ARM adjusts once every year after the first five years.\nAre ARM loans a good idea?\nARM loans can be a good fit for certain types of borrowers. If you're only planning to stay in the home for the introductory period, you won't have to deal with the challenges of rate adjustments that could increase your payment down the road. There are plenty of risks with ARMs, though, so read the fine print and think carefully about whether you would be able to deal with higher payments in the future if you can't sell the home.\nWhat is the average interest rate for an ARM loan?\nAccording to data from Bankrate, the average interest rate for a 5/1 ARM was 6.65% at the end of September. For 7/1 ARMs, the average rate was 6.8%, and rates for 10/1 ARMs averaged 7.19%. Keep in mind those are introductory rates that only apply for the initial fixed-rate period."

      "text": "If you tracked the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions last year, you might have been puzzled: The Fed's three interest rate cuts didn't bring about lower mortgage rates. In fact, the average rate for a 30-year fixed home loan has hovered around 6.8% for the past several months.\nThe Fed's interest rate decisions don't have a direct or immediate effect on home loan rates. Often, what the central bank says about its future plans can move the market more than its actual rate changes.\nOn Wednesday, the Fed is expected to hold off on cutting interest rates for the fifth time this year. While mortgage rates might see some ups and downs, many economists think they'll stay pretty much the same -- between 6.5% and 7% -- until the economic outlook is clearer.\n\"Prospective homebuyers should know markets are forward-looking, and changes in mortgage rates can happen well in advance if markets can anticipate it,\" said Kara Ng, senior economist at Zillow. \"While a July cut is unlikely, markets are closely watching for signals about a possible September reduction,\" Ng said.\nAll eyes will be on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's post-meeting remarks. If Powell signals concerns about lingering inflation or the chance of fewer cuts, bond yields and mortgage rates are likely to climb. If he expresses optimism about inflation being under control and hints at ongoing policy easing, mortgage rates could dip.\nHere's what you need to know about how the government's interest rate policy influences your home loan.\nWhat is the Federal Reserve's relationship to mortgage rates?\nThe Fed sets and oversees US monetary policy under a dual mandate to maintain price stability and maximum employment. It does this largely by adjusting the federal funds rate, the rate at which banks borrow and lend their money.\nWhen the economy weakens and unemployment rises, the Fed lowers interest rates to encourage spending and propel growth, as it did during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIt does the opposite when inflation is high. For example, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate by more than five percentage points between early 2022 and mid-2023, to slow price growth by curbing consumer borrowing and spending.\nChanges in the cost of borrowing set off a slow chain reaction that eventually affects mortgage rates and the housing market, as banks pass along the Fed's rate hikes or cuts to consumers through longer-term loans, including home loans.\nYet, because mortgage rates respond to several economic factors, it's not uncommon for the federal funds rate and mortgage rates to move in different directions for some time.\nWhy is the Fed postponing interest rate cuts?\nAfter making three interest rate cuts in 2024, the Fed has been in a holding pattern throughout 2025. President Trump's unpredictable tariff campaign, immigration policies and federal cutbacks threaten to drive up prices and drag on growth.\nDespite the president's repeated calls for policymakers to cut borrowing rates immediately, economists say the central bank has good reason to pause.\n\"Cutting rates prematurely -- especially in response to political pressure -- could undermine its commitment to controlling inflation,\" said Ng. \" Ironically, this could cause mortgage rates to rise, not fall, counteracting the intended stimulus.\"\nLowering interest rates could allow inflation to surge, which is bad for mortgage rates. Keeping rates high, however, increases the risk of a job-loss recession that would cause widespread financial hardship.\nRecent data show inflation making slow but steady progress toward the Fed's annual target rate of 2%, but price growth is expected to tick back up in the coming months as companies pass on the cost of tariffs onto consumers.\nWhat is the forecast for Fed cuts and mortgage rates in 2025?\nWhile experts now predict an interest rate cut in the fall, Fed Chair Powell remains noncommittal on any specific timeframe.\nInflation could prompt the central bank to forgo one (or both) of its projected rate cuts, which would keep mortgage rates high.\nOn the flip side, if unemployment spikes -- a real possibility given the slowdown in hiring and the uptick in layoffs -- the Fed could be forced to implement interest rate cuts. In that case, mortgage rates should gradually ease, though not dramatically.\nMost housing market forecasts, which already factor in at least two 0.25% Fed cuts, call for 30-year mortgage rates to stay above 6% throughout 2025.\nWhat factors affect mortgage rates?\nMortgage rates move around for many of the same reasons home prices do: supply, demand, inflation and even the employment rate.\nPersonal factors, such as a homebuyer's credit score, down payment and home loan amount, also determine one's individual mortgage rate. Different loan types and terms also have varying interest rates.\nPolicy changes: When the Fed adjusts the federal funds rate, it affects many aspects of the economy, including mortgage rates. The federal funds rate affects how much it costs banks to borrow money, which in turn affects what banks charge consumers to make a profit.\nInflation: Generally, when inflation is high, mortgage rates tend to be high. Because inflation chips away at purchasing power, lenders set higher interest rates on loans to make up for that loss and ensure a profit.\nSupply and demand: When demand for mortgages is high, lenders tend to raise interest rates. This is because they have only so much capital to lend in the form of home loans. Conversely, when demand for mortgages is low, lenders tend to slash interest rates to attract borrowers.\nBond market activity: Mortgage lenders peg fixed interest rates, like fixed-rate mortgages, to bond rates. Mortgage bonds, also called mortgage-backed securities, are bundles of mortgages sold to investors and are closely tied to the 10-year Treasury. When bond interest rates are high, the bond has less value on the market where investors buy and sell securities, causing mortgage interest rates to go up.\nOther key indicators: Employment patterns and other aspects of the economy that affect investor confidence and consumer spending and borrowing also influence mortgage rates. For instance, a strong jobs report and a robust economy could indicate greater demand for housing, which can put upward pressure on mortgage rates. When the economy slows and unemployment is high, mortgage rates tend to be lower.\nRead more: Fact Check: Trump Doesn't Have the Power to Force Lower Interest Rates\nIs now a good time to get a mortgage?\nEven though timing is everything in the mortgage market, you can't control what the Fed does. \"Forecasting interest rates is nearly impossible in today's market,\" said Ali Wolf, Zonda and NewHomeSource chief economist.\nRegardless of the economy, the most important thing when shopping for a mortgage is to make sure you can comfortably afford your monthly payments."

      "text": "Refinancing your mortgage is one of the most lucrative moves a homeowner can make. When you refinance, you take out a new loan on your home to replace your current mortgage. The primary goal is to secure a lower interest rate, which can net you a lower monthly mortgage payment, a shorter-term loan or free up money for a home renovation or other big-ticket item.\nHere's what you need to know about a 30-year fixed-rate refinance mortgage -- the most popular type of refinance home loan -- and how to find the best lenders and rates available to you.\nCurrent 30-year refinance rate trends\nAverage 30-year refinance rates are near a 20-year high at 6.94%, as of April 13, 2023. Mortgage rates tend to rise or fall depending on what's happening with the economy, and are also affected by the federal funds rates set by the Federal Reserve. To mitigate skyrocketing inflation, the Fed raised interest rates seven times in 2022, and hiked rates twice so far in 2023. However, it's likely that mortgage rates will remain flat as long as the Fed continues to act in line with market expectations.\nA 30-year fixed-rate refinance could save you tens of thousands in interest if you're able to secure a lower rate. Here are the pros and cons to consider when deciding if a 30-year fixed refinance is right for you.\nPros and cons of a 30-year refinance\nPros\n- Lower monthly payments: One of the biggest benefits of refinancing is reducing your monthly payment with a lower interest rate. For example, a 15-year mortgage at 6% has a monthly payment of $1,266; a 30-year mortgage at 7% has a monthly payment of $998. The 30-year loan will cost you more in interest over the life of the mortgage but cost $268 less per month.\n- Eliminate private mortgage insurance: If you made less than a 20% down payment and have private mortgage insurance, a refi may allow you to get rid of PMI. (Note that you may also be able to discontinue paying for PMI if you have at least 20% equity in your home.)\nCons\n- Paying more interest over the life of the loan: Although a 30-year refinance will lessen your monthly payments, you will end up paying thousands of dollars more in interest over the course of the loan, since you'll be paying interest for a longer period of time.\n- It requires upfront costs: You will have to pay closing costs and additional lender fees in order to complete your refinance transaction, which could cost thousands of dollars upfront. In 2021, average refinance closing costs were almost $2,500 for a single-family home in the US.\n- Longer loan term: If you refinance into a new 30-year mortgage, it will take you longer to pay off, giving you less financial flexibility in the future.\n- It will take longer to build equity in your home: Since you're extending your loan terms, it can take you more time to build up equity, which means you may not be able to take advantage of a cash-out refinance. You typically need 20% equity in your home to qualify for a cash-out refinance or get rid of PMI.\nHow to compare refi rates\nIf you're thinking about refinancing your home loan, it's important to compare many different lenders and options. If you apply for the first loan you find, you risk paying more in interest and fees. When comparing refinance rates, make sure you're comparing apples to apples: Some lenders will quote you an interest rate, others may show you the APR. (Here's an explanation of how they differ).\nAlso, make sure you're comparing the same repayment term. A longer-term loan will have a lower APR, given that fees are amortized over a longer period. This can give you a misleading impression of which loan is less expensive, even though you will pay more total interest over the life of a longer-term loan.\nAlong with interest rates, it's important to compare the overall cost of a mortgage including closing costs, lender fees and any other charges that come with refinancing. There's no set standard, so lenders can charge a variety of fees during the process.\nDo you qualify for a refinance?\nYou might qualify for a mortgage refinancing if:\n- You have a decent credit score: While you might not need an excellent credit score to qualify for refinancing, the higher your credit score, the lower your refinancing interest rate will be. Different types of loan refinancing have different credit requirements. For instance, you only need a 500 credit score to qualify for an FHA refinancing loan and 580 for a VA loan. Conventional loans require at least a 620 score. Interest rates tend to be lower as your credit score increases.\n- Decent home equity: Try to have at least 20% of home equity or more before refinancing. If you try to refinance before that, you might not be approved. However, if you have good or excellent credit, you may still qualify. But, you may have to pay PMI if you have less than 20% equity in your home.\n- Limited DTI: Your debt-to-income ratio is how much debt you owe compared to how much you earn. Aim to have a DTI of 43% or lower when trying to refinance.\n- Cash on hand: Remember you're on the hook for closing costs and other lender fees when you refinance, so make sure you have enough cash on hand to cover these costs during refinancing.\nWhen should you consider refinancing?\nRefinancing isn't always the right move. When interest rates are on the rise, it may not be the right time to refinance. But if you can substantially reduce your interest rate, monthly payment -- or both -- it might make sense. Some homeowners refinance in order to pay off a home loan sooner, opting for a shorter 15- or 20-year term. Those tend to come with lower interest rates than a 30-year loan. Still, that may not make sense for everyone, because the monthly payment may be higher even with a lower interest rate.\nHow to get the best refi rate\nThe best refinancing rates are usually reserved for applicants who meet the following eligibility requirements:\n- Excellent credit: You'll want to show that you have a solid credit history and a track record for paying your bills on time. You can check your credit for free -- and it's ideal that you do it at least 30 days before you refinance. That way, if there's inaccurate information, you can dispute it and have it removed.\n- Home equity: You can build equity by consistently making mortgage payments over time, and that allows you to borrow money against your home. Usually, more equity will translate to a lower interest rate.\n- Paperwork in order: Each lender has different requirements, but you will typically need to provide a range of documents including pay stubs, bank statements and tax returns.\n- Low debt-to-income ratio: Your DTI ratio represents your total monthly debt payments as a percentage of your monthly income. The lower it is, the more likely you are to qualify for the best refinancing rate.\nCurrent mortgage rates\n| Product | Interest rate |\n|---|---|\n| 30-year fixed-rate | 6.74% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate FHA | 6.70% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate VA | 6.73% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate jumbo | 6.74% |\n| 20-year fixed-rate | 6.51% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate | 5.99% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate jumbo | 6.14% |\n| 5/1 ARM | 5.99% |\n| 5/1 ARM jumbo | 6.20% |\n| 7/1 ARM | 6.25% |\n| 7/1 ARM jumbo | 6.22% |\n| 10/1 ARM | 6.54% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.88% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate FHA refinance | 6.95% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate VA refinance | 7.44% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate jumbo refinance | 6.80% |\n| 20-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.70% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.22% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate jumbo refinance | 6.27% |\n| 5/1 ARM refinance | 6.15% |\n| 5/1 ARM jumbo refinance | 6.18% |\n| 7/1 ARM refinance | 6.63% |\n| 7/1 ARM jumbo refinance | 6.15% |\n| 10/1 ARM refinance | 7.14% |\nWe use information collected by Bankrate to track daily mortgage rate trends. The above table summarizes the average rates offered by lenders across the country.\nFAQs\nMany factors influence refinancing rates. While the broader economy plays a key role in mortgage rates, there are a handful of things specific to you that determine your rate. They include your credit score, your down payment and the loan term and type.\nA 30-year fixed-rate refinance is a loan you take out to pay off your current mortgage, and it becomes the new mortgage you are paying off every month. The interest rate is fixed and you must pay off the loan in 30 years. The most common reasons to refinance with a 30-year fixed-rate loan are to lower your monthly payments and/or your interest rate. A 30-year fixed-rate loan is the most popular type of home loan.\nWhether or not you qualify for a 30-year fixed-rate refinance is determined by lenders, who use a number of factors to decide your eligibility. Your income, your credit score, how much debt you\u2019re carrying, and your loan-to-value ratio all affect the rate a lender will offer you.\nThe decision to refinance is different for everyone and depends on a few key variables: The interest rate of your current mortgage, whether you need access to a larger monthly cash flow, and how much of your mortgage you\u2019ve already paid off. If you plan to move in a few years, it may not be worth it to refinance because you won\u2019t have the new loan long enough to recoup the costs of your refi in lower payments.\nIt\u2019s important to shop around with different lenders to find the right refinance loan for you.\nMore refinance tools and resources\nRefinancing can be a valuable tool for stretching your monthly budget over the length of your mortgage. Even though refinance rates are rising, they are still historically low, offering millions of homeowners the chance to save money every month. By taking into account the factors that make up your personal financial situation and comparing multiple lenders, you can find the best possible 30-year fixed refinance rate available to you and start saving on your monthly mortgage payments."

      "text": "Early this spring, talk of a recession swirled after President Donald Trump began his chaotic tariff campaign. The likelihood of a severe economic downturn hit 66%, according to Polymarket.\nAs Trump deferred some of his most aggressive trade proposals, those forecasts leveled out, but the contours of a potential recession are hard to ignore. Growth in the first quarter of 2025? Down. Jobless claims? Sharply higher. Consumer sentiment? That almost hit rock bottom. On top of that, there are whispers of stagflation, a painful mix of high prices and joblessness, which is even worse than a recession.\nYou won't see the same cracks reflected in the stock market, which runs on the moves of a few big names on Wall Street. Investors cheer each time tariffs are delayed or a trade deal is hinted at. It's why markets continue to etch new highs when most of us feel like we're walking a tightrope.\nBusinesses are effectively in a holding pattern, cutting costs and delaying hiring, which adds to the economic unease. Households battling elevated prices and facing job insecurity are tightening their budgets and spending less. Financial uncertainty can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, said Shang Saavedra, founder and CEO of Save My Cents, a personal finance education platform.\nRead more:\nAre all recessions the same?\nAs tough as they are, recessions are a built-in feature of our economy. Modern capitalism has a historic boom and bust cycle. Since the mid-20th century, the US has experienced a recession roughly once every five to seven years, with an average length of 11 months.\nThe most recent one hit with the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. By April, more than 16 million jobs were lost. Federal policymakers implemented relief and recovery measures to ease hardship and help spur an economic recovery. The pandemic recession was the deepest but also the shortest in the post-World War II era.\nNow, after a significant period of growth, many experts believe another economic reset is on the horizon. \u201cIt\u2019s never a matter of 'if,' but 'when' the next recession is,\u201d said Saavedra.\nFAQ: How to prepare for a recession\nLooking back at past recessions can help us understand what we're facing and allow us to take proactive action regarding money decisions. That means checking in with our financial plans and figuring out what changes we need to make to stay on track.\n1. Is it possible to plan for a recession?\nEven if the economy is a mess, most of us have time to assess our financial situation and make a plan before an economic downturn becomes a reality.\n\"Some folks wait on a recession to be officially 'called' before changing their financial behavior,\u201d said Berna Anat, financial educator and author of Money Out Loud: All the Financial Stuff No One Taught Us. Anat recommends trying to reroute to a preparedness mindset instead of a panic mind-set.\nFor example, focus on establishing realistic safeguards and strengthening your financial foundation. Consider the specific steps you would take if you get laid off. Contributing to an emergency fund and managing your debt levels now can create a buffer against the potential financial shocks of a recession.\nImpulsive actions, like selling investments at a loss, can set you back in the long run. \u201cFear narrows our focus and limits our cognitive ability, so it's really important to prepare now,\u201d said Lisa Countryman-Quiroz, CEO of JVS Bay Area, a workforce development nonprofit.\n2. How much cash should I have saved?\nIn the event of job loss or a reduction in work hours, you need to be able to cover your monthly bills without borrowing money or dipping into your retirement account.\n\"You don\u2019t want to find yourself relying on credit as your only tool for emergencies,\u201c Anat said.\nExperts recommend having an emergency fund that would allow you to cover three to six months of living expenses. To settle on an amount that makes you feel financially secure, consider your current income and job stability; your monthly expenses (housing, medical bills, groceries, utilities); and your future plans (expanding your family, moving, caring for a loved one).\nTo prepare, adjust your budget and avoid stretching your finances too much with unnecessary expenses. Delay major purchases like vacations or buying a home, and avoid growing a balance on a credit card or taking out new loans that will accumulate interest.\nPro tip: The best place to keep your emergency fund is in an account you can access that keeps your money secure. Saavedra recommends a high-yield savings account because it's liquid and provides solid returns on your balance. Money market accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) can also be options.\n3. What should I do if I'm worried about layoffs?\nWhen mass layoffs occur during recessions, it can take months to find new employment. Last year, before talk of a recession even took over headlines, it took jobseekers an average of eight months and 294 applications to land a job.\nPart of building your financial safety net includes planning for job loss before it happens, said Countryman-Quiroz. But having a resume ready is only the first step. Actively networking to expand your professional connections can also open doors to new opportunities.\nMore importantly, try carving out 30 minutes each week to focus on building new skills to help you stand out to employers. Doing this prep work while employed can help you transition more easily into new roles or industries.\n\"It doesn't matter where you are in your career or in the workforce, it's absolutely critical that you build skills around technology -- especially AI -- critical thinking, collaboration and communication,\" said Countryman-Quiroz.\nRead more: Don\u2019t Make the Job Hunt Harder. 9 Strategies to Stay Sane and Get Hired\n4. Should I move my investments?\nWhile market downturns are unsettling, you don't always need to overhaul your investment strategy. The stock market has a history of recovering from dips and growing over time. Selling when things are down often means missing out on the recovery.\nFor most people, staying the course is better than making drastic changes: Stick with a mix of investments you're comfortable with and continue investing.\n\"If retirement is at least five years away, it is not the time to panic,\" said Saavedra. That said, if you are nearing retirement, it may be worth considering safer investments. Money market funds or CDs could be good options if you need more balance and less risk.\n5. Is it better to save money or pay off debt?\nHaving debt becomes a lot more burdensome during a recession, especially if you have a high-interest credit card balance eating away at your income. If inflation stays high or increases, those APRs will only get more painful.\nYou don't need to be 100% debt-free to weather a recession. The goal is to lessen your financial vulnerability, not deplete your savings.\nBefore tackling debt, Saavedra recommends having at least one month of living expenses saved in your emergency fund. Then, start by paying down the debt with the highest interest rates (10% and above) so you pay the least interest over time.\nIf you're juggling several high-interest debts (medical bills, credit cards, etc.), you might also consider a debt consolidation loan, which combines those debts into a single personal loan with one fixed monthly payment.\nAnother strategy is to move your credit card debt to a balance transfer card with a 0% introductory APR, which gives you some breathing room to avoid interest charges for 12 to 24 months. Once that introductory period ends, the card's regular APR kicks in, so you need a plan to pay off what's left.\nHow to emotionally prepare for a recession\nPreparing for a recession involves more than just money. It's about creating a safety net and having a crucial lifeline for your emotional well-being during a stressful time.\n\u201cYou want to feel emotionally supported, knowing that you won\u2019t have only yourself to rely on when the seasons change,\u201d said Anat.\nFor example, reach out to close friends and family to discuss ways you can support each other. Consider setting up informal agreements or exchanging help for meals, caregiving, carpooling or household maintenance. Anat also recommends connecting with local mutual aid funds in your community and exploring ways to contribute resources or receive support. You could start researching mental health services in your area, particularly those offering sliding scale fees or affordable care.\nIn the end, recessions aren't new. If you think of yourself as the captain of a ship or boat, a recession is like a big wave or storm that comes and goes, according to Anat. The size and scope are often unpredictable, but all you can do is prepare for the worst."

      "text": "Buying a house is complicated, and calculating how much you can afford each month can be tricky.\nThe calculator below can help you quickly estimate how much you might pay for mortgage costs. Just enter the home price, down payment, loan term, interest rate and other key details here.\nHow to calculate mortgage payments\nThis calculator excludes expenses like private mortgage insurance, a down payment, closing costs and attorney fees. We do offer some guidelines for estimating those below, though. It's also worth acknowledging that this calculator can only provide an estimate: Your payment will depend on your specific situation, including your property, state of residence and the lender's particular terms and conditions.\nWant to estimate how much you'll pay each month for your mortgage? This calculator uses the standard mortgage equation to determine your estimated monthly payment.\nM = P [ r (1 + r)^n ] / [ (1 + r)^n - 1]\n- M = your monthly mortgage payment\n- P = your principal loan amount\n- r = your monthly interest rate. Most lenders list this as an annual figure, so you'll need to divide this number by 12 to calculate your monthly rate. For example, if your rate is 4%, your monthly rate would be 0.003333 (0.04/12=0.003333).\n- n = the number of monthly payments you'll make over the lifetime of the home loan. To find this, multiply the number of years in your loan term by 12 (the number of months in one year) and you'll get your total number of payments. A standard 30-year fixed mortgage, for example, would have 360 payments (30 x 12 = 360).\nCosts included in your mortgage payment\nIn addition to the principal and interest, there are other upfront and monthly costs to consider as part of the homebuying process:\n- Down payment: Depending on your home loan type, a typical down payment is usually 20% -- though some types of loans will let you put down less -- and even, in some cases, nothing.\n- Closing costs: When you close on your new home, your closing cost may range from 3% to 6% of the total mortgage amount. These costs include:\n- Origination fees. These costs are charged by the lender for \"originating,\" or creating your loan. Other costs in this category include application fees, underwriting fees, processing fees and administrative fees.\n- Points. If you decide to pay for points, you'll pay more upfront in exchange for a lower monthly payment. One point equals 1% of the loan amount.\n- Taxes and government fees. These are charged by your local government.\n- Prepaid expenses and deposits. You'll typically be required to make an upfront deposit into an escrow for your property taxes and homeowners insurance.\n- Mortgage Insurance: Depending on your loan type and down payment amount, you may be required to purchase mortgage insurance, which typically includes an upfront payment.\n- Property taxes and homeowners insurance. In addition to an upfront deposit, you'll also be required to make monthly payments for property taxes and homeowners insurance, typically bundled into your mortgage amount.\nNext steps in the homebuying process\nOnce you know how much home you can afford, you can start the mortgage preapproval process and begin your home search. Your lender will use more detailed information than our calculator, so your actual affordability may look a bit different. And don't forget to shop around to ensure you're getting the best rates available.\nHomebuyer glossary\nWhen you're new to homebuying, some of the terms may be unfamiliar. We've compiled some of the standard terms associated with homebuying to help you understand the process.\n- APR: Your annual percentage rate is the combination of your interest rate and any lender fees.\n- Credit score: Your credit score rates your creditworthiness by telling lenders how likely you are to pay back your loan. In general, the higher your credit score, the lower your interest rate.\n- DTI ratio: Your debt-to-income ratio is your monthly debt payments divided by your monthly income. It shows lenders what percent of your income goes to debt each month. The highest DTI you can have for a mortgage is 43%, though most lenders prefer a DTI of 36% or less.\n- Down payment: Your down payment is the amount of money you pay upfront for your home, listed as a percentage of the purchase price. Most lenders require at least 3% to 5% down, though a down payment of at least 20% will result in no private mortgage insurance.\n- Homeowners insurance: Homeowners insurance is a type of insurance to compensate you for your losses in case your home is damaged or destroyed. Most mortgage lenders require that borrowers have homeowners insurance.\n- Income: For purposes of qualifying for a mortgage, lenders typically use your gross income, meaning your pay before any taxes or other deductions.\n- Mortgage term: Your mortgage term is the number of years of your mortgage. Most mortgages have a 30-year term, but you can also get a 15- or 20-year term.\n- PITI: PITI stands for principal, interest, taxes and insurance, the four components of your monthly housing expense.\n- Property taxes: Property taxes are paid to your local government. The amount you'll pay depends on the value of your home and the property tax rate in your area."

      "text": "Mortgage rates fluctuate daily. For the last several months, they've held high between 6% and 7%, depending on the particular term length (30-year loans have higher rates than 15-year loans) and the type of loan (fixed loans have higher initial rates than adjustable loans).\nHousing market experts aren\u2019t predicting any dramatic dips in rates this month due to a combination of factors: stronger-than-expected economic data, lingering inflation and fewer interest rate cuts by the central bank.\nThat said, the mortgage rates listed here are just averages. Your individual mortgage rate is a separate calculation based on personal factors like your credit score and income, as well as the mortgage lender you choose.\nWhether you need a mortgage now or are planning to purchase a house in the future, comparing multiple loan offers from different lenders is one of the best ways to get a lower interest rate.\nRecent mortgage rate trends\nFannie Mae forecasts average 30-year fixed rates will land near 6.5% by the end of the year, while the Mortgage Bankers Association expects rates to inch down only slightly to 6.7%.\nElevated mortgage rates have locked prospective homebuyers out of the market for three years. In early 2022, the Federal Reserve raised borrowing rates to combat surging inflation, indirectly driving up mortgage rates. However, three interest rate cuts in late 2024 didn't significantly move the needle or make mortgages more affordable.\nThe Fed doesn\u2019t directly set mortgage rates, but monetary policy decisions influence bond yields, the key driver for rates. Uncertainty surrounding President Trump\u2019s economic plans, especially tariffs and government spending, as well as mounting geopolitical conflicts, are making the Fed hesitant about rate cuts before the fall.\nThough mortgage rates may stay near current levels in July, longer-term forecasts aren\u2019t set in stone. Rates could rise, fall or move in a straight line depending on how strong or weak the economy is and how investors interpret that data. Tariff-induced inflation could push mortgage rates up, while increased unemployment could help them go down.\nCurrent mortgage rates\n| Product | Interest rate |\n|---|---|\n| 30-year fixed-rate | 6.74% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate FHA | 6.70% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate VA | 6.73% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate jumbo | 6.74% |\n| 20-year fixed-rate | 6.51% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate | 5.99% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate jumbo | 6.14% |\n| 5/1 ARM | 5.99% |\n| 5/1 ARM jumbo | 6.20% |\n| 7/1 ARM | 6.25% |\n| 7/1 ARM jumbo | 6.22% |\n| 10/1 ARM | 6.54% |\n| 10-year fixed-rate | 6.14% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.88% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate FHA refinance | 6.95% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate VA refinance | 7.44% |\n| 30-year fixed-rate jumbo refinance | 6.80% |\n| 20-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.70% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate refinance | 6.22% |\n| 15-year fixed-rate jumbo refinance | 6.27% |\n| 5/1 ARM refinance | 6.15% |\n| 5/1 ARM jumbo refinance | 6.18% |\n| 7/1 ARM refinance | 6.63% |\n| 7/1 ARM jumbo refinance | 6.15% |\n| 10/1 ARM refinance | 7.14% |\nHow to get the best mortgage rate\nYou can't control the broader macroeconomic factors driving mortgage rates, but there are some ways to get a lower personal rate. Even a difference of a few tenths of a percentage point can shave off thousands of dollars from what you'll pay for your home loan.\n- Build your credit score: A higher credit score can help you qualify for a lower interest rate. Aim to pay bills on time, and keep your credit card balances below 30% of your credit limit. Check your credit report regularly for errors.\n- Save for a bigger down payment: A larger down payment lowers the loan amount you need to borrow, making you less risky to the lender, which could help you become eligible for a lower interest rate.\n- Consider a shorter-term loan: Shorter home loan terms (like a 10- or 15-year mortgage) typically come with lower interest rates than longer-term loans (like 30-year mortgages). However, the monthly payments will be higher.\n- Shop around for mortgage lenders: Compare rates, terms and loan estimates from at least three different mortgage lenders. If one lender offers you a lower interest rate and another offers a better deal on closing costs, you can use that to negotiate.\nWhat to know about mortgages\nYour mortgage rate is the percentage of interest a lender charges for providing the loan you need to buy a home. Multiple factors determine the rate you\u2019re offered. Some are specific to you and your financial situation, and others are influenced by macro market conditions, such as inflation, the Fed\u2019s monetary policy and the overall demand for loans.\nThe broader economy plays a key role in mortgage rates, some key factors under your control affect your rate:\n- Your credit score: Lenders offer the lowest available rates to borrowers with excellent credit scores of 740 and above. Because lower credit scores are deemed riskier, lenders charge higher interest rates to compensate.\n- The size of your loan: The size of your loan can impact the interest rate you qualify for.\n- The loan term: The most common mortgage is a 30-year fixed-rate loan, which spreads your payments over three decades. Shorter loans, such as 15-year mortgages, typically have lower rates but larger monthly payments.\n- The loan type: The type of mortgage you choose impacts your interest rate. Some loans have a fixed rate for the entire life of the loan. Others have an adjustable rate that have lower rates at the start of the loan but could result in higher payments down the road.\nThe annual percentage rate, or APR, is usually higher than your loan\u2019s interest rate and represents the true cost of your loan. It includes the interest rate and other costs such as lender fees or prepaid points. So, while you might be tempted with an offer for \u201cinterest rates as low as 6.5%,\u201d look at the APR instead to see how much you\u2019re really paying.\nMost mortgage loans are based on an amortization schedule: You\u2019ll pay the same amount each month for the life of the loan, but the generated interest will be highest at the beginning and will taper as the principal (the amount you borrowed) decreases. Your amortization schedule will show how much of your monthly payment goes to interest and how much pays down the principal. Most borrowers find a fixed, predictable monthly payment more convenient.\nPros and cons of getting a mortgage\nPros\n- You'll build equity in the property instead of paying rent with no ownership stake.\n- You'll build your credit by making on-time payments.\n- You'll be able to deduct the interest on the mortgage on your annual tax bill.\nCons\n- You'll take on a sizable chunk of debt.\n- You'll pay more than the list price due to interest charges; potentially a lot more over the course of a 30-year loan.\n- You'll have to budget for closing costs to close the mortgage, which add up to tens of thousands of dollars in some states.\nShopping for mortgage rates\nMortgage lenders often publish their rates for different mortgage types, which can help you research and narrow down where you'll apply for preapproval. An advertised rate isn't always the rate you'll get. When shopping for a new mortgage, it's important to compare not just mortgage rates but also closing costs and any other fees associated with the loan. Experts recommend shopping around and reaching out to multiple lenders for quotes and not rushing the process.\nHow to refinance your mortgage\nWhen you refinance your mortgage, you swap out your current home loan for a new one, ideally with better terms.\nDetermine whether you want to do a cash-out refinance or a rate-and-term refinance. With a cash-out refinance, you take out a new mortgage that's bigger than your existing one and pocket the difference as cash. With a basic rate-and-term refinance, you take out a loan the same size as your existing mortgage, just with a new interest rate and/or loan term.\nThe refinancing process will feel the same as securing your existing mortgage. You'll need to choose a lender, apply for the loan, wait for the underwriting process to conclude, have your home appraised and close on your new loan. Just like with your original mortgage, you'll need to pay another set of closing costs when you refinance.\nFAQs\nMost conventional loans require a credit score of 620 or higher, but Federal Housing Administration and other loan types may accommodate borrowers with scores as low as 500, depending on the lender.\nYour credit score isn\u2019t the only factor that impacts your mortgage rate. Lenders will also look at your debt-to-income ratio to assess your level of risk based on the other debts you\u2019re paying back such as student loans, car payments and credit cards. Additionally, your loan-to-value ratio plays a key role in your mortgage rate.\nA rate lock means your interest rate won\u2019t change between the offer and the time you close on the house. For example, if you lock in a rate at 6.5% today and your lender\u2019s rates climb to 7.25% over the next 30 days, you\u2019ll get the lower rate. A common rate-lock period is 45 days, so you\u2019re still on a tight timeline. Be sure to ask lenders about rate lock windows and the cost to secure your rate."
