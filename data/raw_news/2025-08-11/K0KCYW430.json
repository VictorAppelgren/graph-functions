  "content": "ALT5 Sigma Corporation (Nasdaq: ALTS), a financial firm offering blockchain-powered technologies, announced on Aug. 11 that it is going to raise $1.5 billion via the sale of 200 million shares in order to create a World Liberty Financial (WLFI) corporate treasury.\n\nThe World Liberty Financial is a decentralized finance (DeFi) backed by the Trump family, which is reportedly exploring the option of going public and raising around $1.5 billion to hold WLFI tokens.\n\n\"One small step for mankind, one giant leap for WLFI,\" World Liberty Financial wrote on X.\n\nFounded in 2018, ALT5 Sigma offers next-gen blockchain-powered technologies for tokenization, trading, clearing settlement, payment and safekeeping of crypto assets. Through its subsidiaries, the firm offers two main platforms to its customers: ALT5 Pay and ALT5 Prime. It has processed over $5 billion in crypto transactions since inception.\n\nJoin the discussion with CryptoWendyO on Roundtable here.\n\nALT5 Sigma is one of the latest companies to create a crypto asset treasury firm, similar to Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy (Nasdaq: MSTR) and Tom Lee's BitMine Immersion (NYSE: BMNR). While the former is the leading Bitcoin treasury firm, the latter is the leading Ethereum treasury firm. Now, even WLFI is also becoming a preferred asset among crypto treasury firms.\n\nThe president's eldest child, Donald Trump Jr., said he was excited about the partnership. Eric Trump, the president's third child, also hailed the move.\n\nFollowing the announcement and these tweets, the ALTS stock immediately declined by more than 25% in value. It was trading at $6.49 at the time of writing.\n\nCrypto stock drops 25% after Eric Trump's bullish post first appeared on TheStreet on Aug 11, 2025\n\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Aug 11, 2025, where it first appeared.",

Particularly, as more dollars come onchain in the form of stablecoins, that could lead to increased activity onchain, and increased demand for Ethereum.\n\u201cStablecoins have proven to be the 'ChatGPT' of crypto, leading to rapid adoption by consumers, merchants and financial services providers,\u201d Lee said, noting that the chain has become for a large chunk of stablecoin transactions.\nThe move comes as many across crypto look to emulate what has worked so well for Michael Saylor and his Bitcoin treasury company Strategy. Strategy shares have gained a staggering 1,700% since the beginning of 2023 simply by stacking Bitcoin and selling debt and shares against that position.\nEthereum co-founder Joe Lubin was among the first to carry the trend over to Ethereum with SharpLink gaming. The publicly traded company has seen shares swing wildly as investors calculate what upside may be there if these ethereum treasury companies can capture just a fraction of the same success.\nBitMine stock surges 400% as Tom Lee joins Ethereum treasury company first appeared on TheStreet on Jun 30, 2025\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Jun 30, 2025, where it first appeared."

The HOOD stock also fell more than 3% to $99.91.\nJoin the discussion with Scott Melker on Roundtable here.\nNow, you might be wondering why these stocks are declining despite posting earnings that beat estimates. Well, it's the Donald Trump effect.\nOn July 31, the president announced the latest tariff hikes as the 120-day deadline loomed large. The announcement sent the markets into a state of frenzy, and hence the decline in the value of these two stocks.\nCoinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) demonstrated this impact the most, as its stock declined more than 15% to $319.82.\nThe largest crypto exchange in the U.S., Coinbase, also recently reported its financial results but failed to beat estimates. During Q2, it generated $1.4 billion in net income, $1.5 billion in total revenue, and EPS of $5.14.\nThough its own underperformance led to the stock's decline, Trump's latest announcement added insult to injury.\nHIVE Digital (Nasdaq: HIVE), the Bitcoin miner, also fell 4% to $2.045.\nAt the time of writing, all the leading crypto stocks remained in the red zone.\nMicroStrategy, Robinhood stocks reel despite shocking earnings first appeared on TheStreet on Aug 1, 2025\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Aug 1, 2025, where it first appeared."
