  "content": "Minnesota News You Can Use\n\nHealth Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is vowing to ''fix'' the federal program for compensating Americans injured by vaccines, opening the door to sweeping changes for a system long targeted by anti-vaccine activists. WASHINGTON \u2014 Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is vowing to ''fix'' the federal program for compensating Americans injured by vaccines, opening the door to sweeping changes for a system long targeted by anti-vaccine activists. Health experts and lawyers say updates are needed to help clear a backlog of cases in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, created by Congress in 1986 as a no-fault payment system for presumed vaccine injuries. But they also worry Kennedy's changes will reflect his history as a leader in the anti-vaccine movement, which has alternately called for abolishing the program or expanding it to cover unproven injuries and illnesses that aren't connected to vaccines. Kennedy and other critics believe the program is ''too miserly in what it considers to be a vaccine injury,'' said Jason Schwartz, a public health expert at Yale University. ''That's created great concern that he could expand what's included.'' Anti-vaccine groups have long suggested a link between vaccines and autism, despite scientific consensus that childhood vaccines don't cause the condition. Adding autism to the list of injuries covered by the plan ''would dramatically increase the number of compensable cases, potentially bankrupting it,\" Schwartz said. Program is credited with saving the U.S. vaccine industry Signed into law under President Ronald Reagan, the compensation program is designed to provide quick, efficient compensation to Americans who report known injuries associated with vaccines, such as rare allergic reactions. At the time of its creation, a number of vaccine-makers were exiting the business due to risks of class action lawsuits. In a recent social media post, Kennedy called the program ''broken'' and accused federal lawyers and adjudicators who run it of ''inefficiency, favoritism and outright corruption.'' Kennedy didn't specify the changes he's seeking. But some of the people he's enlisted to help have a history of bringing vaccine injury cases. In June, the Department of Health and Human Services awarded a $150,000 contract to an Arizona law firm for ''expertise'' in the program. The firm's Andrew Downing, an attorney specializing in vaccine injury cases, was listed in the HHS staff directory for a time. ''We just brought a guy in this week who is going to be revolutionizing the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program,'' Kennedy told Tucker Carlson shortly after the award. Revamping the program would be the latest in a string of decisions that have upended U.S. vaccine policy, including this week's cancellation of research funding for vaccines using mRNA technology. Downing and Kennedy have had roles in HPV vaccine lawsuits Downing has had a leading role in lawsuits against Merck alleging injuries from its HPV vaccine, Gardasil, including a rare movement disorder. In a podcast last year for people with the condition, Downing lamented that the injury compensation program ''has taken a hard line'' against such cases, leading lawyers to file injury lawsuits in civil court. Approximately 70% of the Gardasil cases against Merck started as claims filed by Downing in the federal injury program, according to court records. A judge dismissed more than 120 of those cases, citing ''a paucity of evidence\" that Gardasil caused patients' problems. A spokesman for Kennedy declined to comment on Downing's hiring. Kennedy himself has been involved in the Gardasil litigation, as both an attorney and consultant. Before joining the government, Kennedy received payments for referring potential Gardasil clients to Wisner Baum, one of the law firms suing Merck. Following questions about the agreement during his confirmation hearings, Kennedy agreed to give up his stake in the deal and transfer any future fees to ''a nondependent, adult son,\" according to his financial disclosures. One of Kennedy's sons is an attorney at Wisner Baum. Experts see need for reform Experts who study vaccine compensation say real changes are needed to modernize the 40-year-old program. The cap on compensation remains $250,000 for injury or death, the same as in 1986. Similarly, the program still has eight adjudicators, known as special masters, to review all cases before the government. On average, the process takes two to three years. The fund has paid out $5.4 billion, compensating about 40% of all people who filed claims. The U.S. has an ''ethical obligation'' to promptly pay those harmed by government-recommended vaccines, says Dorit Reiss, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law. ''Plus, I think it increases trust in the vaccination program if you have quick, generous compensation,'' Reiss said. As health secretary, Kennedy has broad powers to reshape the program. One approach could be adding new diseases and illnesses to the government table of payable injuries. In the early 2000s, the program ruled against more than 5,000 claims from families who said vaccines led to their children's autism, citing hundreds of scientific studies discrediting the link. Critics of Kennedy say he could claim that he has new evidence of harm \u2014 perhaps from a large autism study he's commissioned \u2014 and add the condition to the program. In response, the federal government might have to increase taxes on vaccines to replenish the compensation fund, which would make the shots more expensive and less accessible. ''Then you will start to watch the vaccine program infrastructure in this country disintegrate until someone steps in,'' Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine researcher at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia who has clashed with Kennedy for years. A recent Senate hearing titled ''Voice of the Vaccine Injured'' appeared to make the case for expanding the program. Witnesses included two representatives from Children's Health Defense, the nonprofit group that Kennedy previously chaired and has repeatedly sued the government over vaccines. The group's chief science officer, Brian Hooker, told lawmakers he tried unsuccessfully for 16 years trying to get compensation for his son's autism, which he attributes to the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Another approach would involve removing certain vaccines from the program, making it easier to bring lawsuits against vaccine-makers. Under current law, people claiming injuries from vaccines covered by the program must first pursue a compensation claim before they can sue. In cases where the science doesn't support a connection to vaccines, lawyers might be more successful before a jury. ''Jury trials take advantage of the fact that most jurors don't know anything about science or medicine,'' Offit said. ''They are not going to be as easily moved by the data.'' Still, attorneys who bring cases before the compensation program say the process has become more burdensome and adversarial over the years. Even small changes could improve things. For instance, the statute of limitations for claims could be extended beyond the current three years, which lawyers say cuts off many potential clients. ''I'm hoping there will be changes put in place that make the program easier for petitioners to navigate'' said Leah Durant, a vaccine injury attorney.

''She has earned this opportunity, and we are proud of the strong example she has set, particularly for all the women and young girls who aspire to roles on the field.''\nPawol, a 48-year-old from New Jersey, worked spring training games in 2024 and this year.

It's good for the game.''\nMLB's move comes 28 years after the gender barrier for game officials was broken in the NBA, 10 years after the NFL hired its first full-time female official and three years after the men's soccer World Cup employed a female referee. The NHL still has not had any women as on-ice officials.\n\"I think if she is a good enough umpire, obviously she deserves to be here,'' Toronto pitcher Kevin Gausman said.\nPawol in 2024 became the first woman to umpire big league spring training games since Ria Cortesio in 2007.

It's not clear what caused the problem, which was resolved late Wednesday. While residual delays were expected, United said its team was working to restore normal operations.\nAbout 35% of all the airline's flights were delayed and another 7% were canceled Wednesday, according to FlightAware, a website that tracks flight disruptions.

FlightAware reported 43 cancellations at Chicago O'Hare by Thursday morning, including 42 United flights.\nAn alert on the Federal Aviation Administration website Wednesday said all United flights destined for Chicago were halted at their departing airports. Flights to United hubs at Denver, Newark, Houston and San Francisco airports also were affected.\nThe airline's travel alert page noted that a technology disruption might impact flights to or from several U.S. airports from Thursday to Sunday including Denver, Newark, Washington, Houston, New York, Los Angeles, Orlando, Chicago, San Francisco, Honolulu and Guam and some in Europe, such as London, Frankfurt and Munich.\n''Safety is our top priority, and we'll work with our customers to get them to their destinations,'' an emailed statement from the Chicago-based airline said.\nThe system outage, as the company described it, lasted several hours, the statement said. It wasn't related to recent concerns about airline industry cybersecurity. United said it was treating it as a controllable delay, meaning it paid customer expenses such as hotels when applicable.\nIn an interview, United Airlines passenger Benjamin Fuentes, who flew from Boston to Houston, told KTRK-TV that they were told that they would be waiting for a while after the plane landed."

      "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump said Wednesday that he will impose a 100% tariff on computer chips, raising the specter of higher prices for electronics, autos, household appliances and other essential products dependent on the processors powering the digital age.\n\u2018\u2019We\u2019ll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors,\u2019\u2019 Trump said in the Oval Office while meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook. \u201cBut if you\u2019re building in the United States of America, there\u2019s no charge.\u201d\nThe announcement came more than three months after Trump temporarily exempted most electronics from his administration\u2019s most onerous tariffs.\nThe Republican president said companies that make computer chips in the U.S. would be spared the import tax. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage of computer chips increased the price of autos and contributed to higher inflation.\nInvestors seemed to interpret the potential tariff exemptions as a positive for Apple and other major tech companies that have been making huge financial commitments to manufacture more chips and other components in the U.S..\nBig Tech already has made collective commitments to invest about $1.5 trillion in the U.S. since Trump moved back into the White House in January. That figure includes a $600 billion promise from Apple after the iPhone maker boosted its commitment by tacking another $100 billion on to a previous commitment made in February.\nNow the question is whether the deal brokered between Cook and Trump will be enough to insulate the millions of iPhones made in China and India from the tariffs that the administration has already imposed and reduce the pressure on the company to raise prices on the new models expected to be unveiled next month.\nWall Street certainly seems to think so. After Apple\u2019s stock price gained 5% in Wednesday regular trading sessions, the shares rose by another 3% in extended trading after Trump announced some tech companies won\u2019t be hit with the latest tariffs while Cook stood alongside him."

      "text": "Minnesota deer farmers have been denied a second time in their fight to stop a 2023 state law that will bring an end to their industry in Minnesota after another generation.\nThe Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court\u2019s dismissal of the group\u2019s lawsuit, rejecting their argument that they have the right to pursue a chosen profession.\n\u201cThere is no fundamental right to pursue the occupation of whitetail deer farming,\u201d the Eighth Circuit justices ruled.\nThe change in law adopted by the 2023 Legislature introduced new regulations aimed at ridding deer farms as vectors of chronic wasting disease (CWD) \u2014 a growing problem in Minnesota\u2019s wild deer herd. The law prohibits the formation of any new deer farms and limits existing herd owners to one transfer of their business, and only to an immediate family member.\nAnother change in the law gave the Department of Natural Resources authority to require deer farmers to upgrade fencing to prevent physical contact between captive deer and wild deer.\nA year ago, U.S. District Court Judge John Tunheim ruled the eventual elimination of deer farms in Minnesota was an \u201cunfortunate\u201d consequence of the law. The judge said the state has a legitimate interest in containing the infectious spread of CWD, an always-fatal neurological disease that DNR has been spending millions of dollars to keep in check. DNR wildlife biologists have connected past outbreaks in wild deer to infected deer farms.\nThe Minnesota Deer Farmers Association, along with individual deer farmers, filed suit against the state, seeking an injunction to prevent enforcement of the new regulations. They have argued it\u2019s a violation of the 14th Amendment that they\u2019re not being allowed to pursue an occupation of their choice.\nScott Fier, president of the deer farmers association, wrote to members last year to say there was hope of a favorable outcome. If denied in District Court, the focus would shift to appealing in the Eighth Circuit, \u201cwhere our case will be heard by primarily conservative judges.\u201d"

His announcement came on the eve of a White House deadline for Moscow to show progress toward ending the 3-year-old war in Ukraine or suffer additional economic sanctions.\nNo location had been determined Thursday morning, according to a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nThe U.S. was still expected to impose additional sanctions Friday on Russia, the official said, adding that a Trump-Putin meeting would not happen if the Russian leader does not agree to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The official did not specify whether the condition was for Zelenskyy to be present at the possible U.S.-Russia summit.\nSpeaking of possible direct talks with Zelenskyy, Putin said he has mentioned several times that he was not against it, adding: ''It's a possibility, but certain conditions need to be created'' for it to happen.\nThe Kremlin has previously said that Putin and Zelenskyy should meet only when an agreement negotiated by their delegations is close.\nUkraine fears being sidelined by direct negotiations between Washington and Moscow, and Zelenskyy said he had phone conversations with several European leaders Thursday amid a flurry of diplomatic activity. European countries have pledged to back Ukraine for as long as it takes to defeat Russia's invasion.\nPutin's foreign affairs adviser, Yuri Ushakov, earlier brushed aside the possibility of Zelenskyy joining the summit, something the White House said Trump was ready to consider. Putin has spurned Zelenskyy's previous offers of a meeting to clinch a breakthrough.\n''We propose, first of all, to focus on preparing a bilateral meeting with Trump, and we consider it most important that this meeting be successful and productive,'' Ushakov said, adding that U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff's suggestion of a meeting including Ukraine's leader ''was not specifically discussed.''"

The official was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss internal plans.\nThe White House said Trump was also open to a meeting with both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nA meeting between Putin and Trump would be their first since Trump returned to office this year. It would be a significant milestone in the 3-year-old war, though there's no promise such a meeting would lead to the end of the fighting since Russia and Ukraine remain far apart on their demands.\nTrump, appearing before reporters later at the White House, didn't answer questions about a potential location for a meeting but when asked about a summit with Putin and Zelenskyy, said ''there's a very good prospect that they will'' meet.\nThe president declined to predict how close he was to reaching a deal to end the fighting, saying, ''I've been disappointed before with this one.''\nRubio lowers expectations for a meeting\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who was asked in an interview on Fox Business about a potential Trump-Putin meeting, said ''a lot has to happen before that can occur.''"

An inning later, he missed a ball he dived for in center field.\nThe message from the coaching staff: Keep at it.\nThe baserunning blunder was strategized in the dugout beforehand. There was a long delay in the seventh inning because of an injury to home-plate umpire Chad Fairchild. Coaches talked to Martin about how far Detroit Tigers third baseman Colt Keith strayed off the bag with lefty-hitting Kody Clemens in the batter\u2019s box.\nOn a 0-2 count, Martin shuffled for a step before he tried a delayed steal. Keith wasn\u2019t fooled, and Martin was easily thrown out.\n\u201cHe got to the bag a lot quicker than I thought he would be able to,\u201d Martin said. \u201cWe had that conversation, and I thought I saw it, so I just went for it.\u201d\nIn the eighth inning, with the Twins leading 6-1, Detroit\u2019s Jahmai Jones hit a ball to Martin in center. The ball was out of Martin\u2019s reach, and the result of his dive turned a likely RBI single into a two-run triple after the ball skipped past him.\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to play with confidence and try to get as many balls as I possibly can,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI want to play aggressive, but not reckless.

El Al said the offices were unoccupied at the time of the incident and no one was harmed. Photos shared on social media showed red spray paint across the glass doors and walls, including the phrase ''El Al genocide airline.''\nThe airline said it was handling the matter with the ''utmost gravity'' and working ''in close coordination'' with authorities in France and Israel.'' El Al added it ''unequivocally condemns all forms of violence, particularly those driven by hatred,'' and said its planes ''proudly'' display the Israeli flag.\nIsraeli Transportation Minister Miri Regev condemned the act and blamed the policies of French President Emmanuel Macron. ''Today it's El Al, tomorrow it's Air France,'' she wrote on social media. ''When President Macron makes announcements that give gifts to Hamas, this is the result.''\nThe incident comes amid diplomatic friction following Macron's pledge last month to recognize a Palestinian state \u2014 a move welcomed by some European allies but strongly opposed by Israel.\nIsrael's Foreign Ministry also condemned what it called an antisemitic attack and urged the French government to ensure the safety of El Al staff and offices and to bring the perpetrators to justice.\nIn May, several Jewish sites across Paris were defaced with green paint, including the Shoah Memorial, three synagogues and a Jewish restaurant.\nFrance is home to Western Europe's largest Jewish population, with an estimated 500,000 Jews \u2014 approximately 1% of the national population."
