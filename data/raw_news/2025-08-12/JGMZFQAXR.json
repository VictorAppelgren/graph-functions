  "content": "The Trump administration has cautioned that a reversal of President Donald Trump\u2018s tariffs could pose a threat to federal benefits such as Social Security and Medicare.\n\nUS Warns Court Tariff Reversal Could Trigger Trillions In Refunds\n\nSolicitor General D. John Sauer and Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate voiced this concern to a federal appellate court on Monday, according to a report by Axios on Tuesday. They suggested that if the U.S. were forced to refund trillions of dollars from deals not yet fully finalized, the nation could face severe economic repercussions.\n\nTariff deals with Japan, South Korea, and the EU include pledges for over $1 trillion in U.S. project investments.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is expected to soon rule on whether to affirm or overturn the Court of International Trade's late-May decision that struck down most of Trump's tariffs. Sauer and Shumate's letter introduces fresh arguments in favor of keeping the tariffs in place.\n\nThe letter states, \u201cIf the United States were forced to pay back the trillions of dollars committed to us, America could go from strength to failure the moment such an incorrect decision took effect.\u201d They also warned of potential job losses, forced evictions, and threats to Social Security and Medicare.\n\n\u201c\u2026.millions of jobs would be eliminated, hard-working Americans would lose their savings, and even Social Security and Medicare could be threatened.\u201d\n\nThe letter from Sauer and Shumate suggests that while the Trump administration intends to introduce a new tariff program if the current one is struck down by the courts, the alternatives would be less effective \u2014 a point the administration has not acknowledged before.\n\nSEE ALSO: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Dogecoin Start The Week Green Ahead Of US-China Trade Talks \u2013 Benzinga\n\nThis warning comes after President Trump hinted at a potential economic fallout if his extensive tariff policy is overturned, suggesting a new Great Depression could be on the horizon. Trump\u2019s concerns about a negative verdict on the tariff policy by a \u201cRadical Left Court\u201d and the difficulty the U.S. would face in recovering from such an economic setback.\n\nMoreover, investment bank Piper Sandler has previously declared President Trump\u2019s trade deals illegal, predicting a Supreme Court ruling against Trump by June 2026, reported Fortune. The bank\u2019s analysis of ongoing court battles and legislative authority concluded that Trump\u2019s reliance on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose wide-ranging tariffs and cut bilateral deals far exceeds the powers granted by Congress.\n\u2022 Anthony Scaramucci Says Wall Street Fooling Itself On Trump Leaving In 2028: Who Builds A $200 Million Ballroom And \u2018Moves Out\u2019 In 3.5 Years\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.",

      "text": "Retirement, ideally a period of relaxation and enjoyment after years of hard work, is often envisioned as a time to pursue hobbies, travel or simply unwind. But without a solid financial plan, many Americans worry they\u2019ll outlive their money. This fear is often more acute among married couples, who face the added complexity of planning for two people with varying financial needs.\nIf you're 50 or older and have over $100,000 in investable assets, now is the time to take retirement planning seriously. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be difficult. WiserAdvisor's free tool matches you with a vetted financial advisor that meets your needs, with no obligation to hire.\n60% of Americans Lack a Retirement-Specific Account\u2013 Do you?\nA NerdWallet study, using the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances, indicates that 60% of Americans lack a retirement-specific account. The disparity in average household retirement savings by age group further illustrates this issue:\n- Under 35: $49,130 (median: $18,880)\n- Ages 35 to 44: $141,520 (median: $45,000)\n- Ages 45 to 54: $313,220 (median: $115,000)\n- Ages 55 to 64: $537,560 (median: $185,000)\n- Ages 65 to 74: $609,230 (median: $200,000)\nThese figures show a significant gap between average and median savings, pointing to a broad spectrum of financial preparedness across different age groups. Those nearing retirement, especially those with $250,000 or more in retirement savings, stand to benefit most from expert, fiduciary guidance.\nTo guide couples in their retirement planning, T. Rowe Price, a reputable global investment management firm, provides savings benchmarks as multiples of income, varying by household income and marital status.\nFor example, a dual-income married couple with an annual income of $75,000 at age 55 should have retirement savings equal to five times their income, which should increase to 8.5 times by age 65. These benchmarks scale up for higher-income brackets, and for those with $250,000 or more in assets, strategic investment planning becomes especially important.\nFind a Vetted Financial Advisor\nIf you\u2019ve worked hard to build a nest egg of $100,000 or more, WiserAdvisor can connect you with a trusted, independent fiduciary advisor who understands the unique financial needs of pre-retirees and retirees.\nFiduciary advisors are legally required to put your interests first. They can help you:\n- Create a tax-smart drawdown plan\n- Manage and grow a diversified investment portfolio\n- Maximize Social Security strategies\n- Protect assets for your spouse or heirs\n- The matching service is fast and free\u2014and designed specifically for individuals with significant investable assets who are looking for personalized, high-quality advice.\nTake the first step toward a more confident retirement. If you have at least $100,000 in investable assets, WiserAdvisor can match you with a pre-screened fiduciary financial advisor in your area.\nBook here to get started; no cost, no obligation.\nBenzinga Money is a reader-supported publication.

      "text": "Anthony Scaramucci, former White House Communications Director, has challenged Wall Street\u2019s assumption that President Donald Trump will leave office in three and a half years and warned that the full impact of his tariffs is yet to come.\nScaramucci Criticizes Wall Street\u2019s Optimism Over Trump\u2019s Exit\nIn a video posted over the weekend, Scaramucci expressed concern that Wall Street is complacent, believing Trump's time in office is limited.\nHe highlighted the President's $200 million White House ballroom renovation project, questioning the belief that Trump will leave in 3.5 years.\n\"Do you know anybody who builds a $200 million ballroom onto their house and moves out in three and a half years?\" Scaramucci said. \"The guy\u2019s making expansive renovations to the White House. Doesn\u2019t smell like a guy that wants to leave anytime soon.\"\nScaramucci continued, suggesting that Trump's presidency is far from over, pointing to the expanding renovations and a growing \"personality cult\" around him.\nHe cautioned Wall Street that a \"cleanup\" of Trump's policies will be needed but is unlikely to happen quickly. The challenge, he warned, will be economic, particularly due to the ongoing trade war and the implementation of tariffs.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to Benzinga's request for comments.\nSee Also: Apple's Smart Move May Save iPhone Sales\u2013And The Stock Could Soar\nTrump Rules Out Third Term\nIn a May interview with NBC News, Trump said he does not plan to seek a third term, confirming that his presidency would conclude after the 2028 election. Trump cited constitutional limits on presidential terms and said he intends to \"pass the torch\" to another Republican.\nWhile noting past speculation \u2014 including the sale of red \"Trump 2028\" hats \u2014 Trump dismissed the idea of another run, saying his focus is on \"four great years\" before handing over the reins \"to somebody, ideally a great Republican.\"\nHe named Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as strong contenders but refrained from making any endorsements, calling it \"far too early\" to decide.\nThe Real Tariff Pain Hasn't Hit Yet\nTurning to the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs, Scaramucci stressed that Wall Street is ignoring the true economic consequences of the administration\u2019s protectionist policies.\nWhile some have said that the tariffs haven't yet led to a recession, Scaramucci argued that the real effects are still to come. He pointed out that many economists are beginning to notice a slowdown in capital allocation decisions, with tariffs starting to hurt U.S. businesses.\n\u201cSo the MAGA narrative is \u2018ho ho still got a strong economy despite our tariffs,\u2019 but the real narrative should be, \u2018No, the tariffs haven\u2019t fully kicked in yet,'\u201d he stated in the video.\nRising Inflation And Economic Pressures\nThe effects of the tariffs are already starting to show in inflation, with core inflation set to rise in the coming months. Economists forecast the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to increase by 0.2% month-over-month in July, largely driven by higher import duties.\nU.S. businesses have been absorbing most of the costs, but this burden is expected to shift to consumers. Goldman Sachs economist Elsie Peng predicts that by October, U.S. consumers will shoulder 67% of the tariff costs, up from 22% currently.\nRead Next:\nPhoto Courtesy: Al Teich On Shutterstock.com\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Get in before Q3 trades take off \u2192\nPresident Donald Trump is warning of potential economic fallout if his extensive tariff policy is overturned, hinting at a new Great Depression.\nWhat Happened: Trump voiced his apprehensions in a post on Truth Social, suggesting that a negative verdict on the tariff policy by a \u201cRadical Left Court\u201d could have catastrophic implications for the country\u2019s economy. He underscored the difficulty the U.S. would face in bouncing back from such an economic setback.\n\"If a Radical Left Court ruled against us at this late date, in an attempt to bring down or disturb the largest amount of money, wealth creation and influence the U.S.A. has ever seen, it would be impossible to ever recover, or pay back, these massive sums of money and honor. It would be 1929 all over again, a GREAT DEPRESSION!\" he said in the post.\n\"There is no way America could recover from such a judicial tragedy, but I know our Court System better than anyone, there is no one in history that has gone through the trials, tribulations and uncertainties such as I, and absolutely terrible, but also amazingly beautiful, things can happen. Our Country deserves SUCCESS AND GREATNESS, NOT TURMOIL, FAILURE, AND DISGRACE,\" Trump further added.\nAlso Read: Jim Cramer Has Blunt Message for Fed Chair Powell After July Job Numbers Tanked\nThe President\u2019s tariffs, introduced on Thursday, have stirred the global trade system. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed with a 0.5 percent loss in the aftermath of the tariff imposition, and the S&P 500 index also dipped by approximately 0.1 percent.\nHowever, the markets made a comeback on Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average seeing a 0.6 percent increase and the S&P 500 index climbing by 0.8 percent.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is presently examining Trump\u2019s rationale for his tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Earlier this week, former House Speaker Paul Ryan speculated that Trump\u2019s emergency tariff authority could be overruled by the Supreme Court.\nWhile economic historians generally agree that tariffs were not a cause of the Great Depression, some do argue that the Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act signed into law on June 17, 1930, less than nine months after the Wall Street crash of 1929, made the Depression worse.\nWhy It Matters: The potential reversal of Trump\u2019s tariff policy could have far-reaching implications for the U.S. economy. The President\u2019s warning of a possible depression underscores the gravity of the situation.\nThe tariffs, which have already caused fluctuations in the stock market, are a contentious issue that could significantly impact global trade.\nThe outcome of the U.S. Court of Appeals\u2019 review of the tariffs under the IEEPA will be critical in determining the future direction of the U.S. economy.\nRead Next\nImage: Shutterstock/Dennis MacDonald\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
