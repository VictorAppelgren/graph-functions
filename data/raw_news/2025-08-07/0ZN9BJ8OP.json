  "title": "Man Utd 'decide next two signings after Benjamin Sesko' as trio near exits",
  "description": "Man Utd have reportedly decided on the two signings they want to complete their summer.",
  "content": "Manchester United will focus their attention towards signing a central midfielder and goalkeeper before the summer transfer deadline once Benjamin Sesko completes his switch. United are in advanced talks with RB Leipzig after bidding \u00a374million for the 22-year-old striker, who has already agreed terms on a contract until 2030. The Red Devils' initial contact for Brighton and Hove Albion midfielder Carlos Baleba is an indication of the direction of travel once Sesko arrives at Old Trafford. While the 21-year-old could be unattainable this summer, Ruben Amorim and the club's recruitment team will have alternatives lined up to bolster his engine room.\n\nAccording to The i Paper, United want to sign a dynamic, energetic midfielder to partner Bruno Fernandes and Kobbie Mainoo in Amorim's 3-4-3 system. A goalkeeper is also said to be on the agenda, but Paris Saint-Germain's Gianluigi Donnarumma is not viewed as a realistic option this summer. United need to oversee sales to fund any further big-money moves beyond Sesko, who would elevate Amorim's summer spending above \u00a3200m. Rasmus Hojlund is expected to depart after Sesko's arrival, while four members of the 'bomb squad' continue their exile at Carrington as they explore exits. For the latest breaking stories and headlines, sign up to our Daily Express MUFC newsletter, or join our WhatsApp community here.\n\nIt's claimed that United could accept an offer as low as \u00a330m for Hojlund, with Joshua Zirkzee and Chido Obi viewed as preferred competition in the striker position. The report adds that Alejandro Garnacho is also expected to leave soon after Chelsea stepped up their interest in striking a deal. United and their Premier League rivals remain apart on Garnacho's valuation, but a compromise before the deadline is viewed as likely. The 21-year-old winger has snubbed interest from elsewhere to hold out for a switch to Stamford Bridge, and she should get his wish in the coming weeks. For the latest breaking stories and headlines, sign up to our Daily Express transfer newsletter.\n\nFinally, Jadon Sancho is another outcast primed to seal his escape sooner rather than later. Inter Milan have reportedly entered the frame for his signature. Borussia Dortmund and Juventus have also been linked, but another loan exit appears the most probable outcome. United are believed to prefer a permanent sale but are open to a loan if it means clearing Sancho's wages from the books. Business is far from over at Old Trafford this summer as Amorim continues to mould his squad ahead of his first full season in charge.",

      "text": "Benjamin Sesko has picked Manchester United over Newcastle United, and could yet be joined by other big-money targets as Ruben Amorim\u2019s squad continues to get a major facelift this summer.\nThe i Paper understands Sesko has verbally agreed to personal terms at Old Trafford and will complete his move once United and RB Leipzig can agree on a fee.\nIt is understood an agreement is near, as United\u2019s \u00a374m offer is close to Leipzig\u2019s valuation. Both the German club and the striker want to end their link-up amicably, so a compromise is expected to be found imminently.\nSesko is the third forward United have splashed the cash on this summer \u2013 following the arrivals of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo \u2013 to the tune of \u00a3200m. Not bad for a club whose co-owner, Sir Jim Ratcliffe, said would come close to running out of cash by Christmas had it not been for Ineos\u2019 cost-cutting measures.\nAs The i Paper reported earlier this week, a reassessment of the club\u2019s financial position has led to a major change in outlook. The club can afford to act now and will look to do all they can to sanction more arrivals, once Sesko is completed, before the new season kicks off in less than two weeks.\nWhere do Man Utd want to strengthen?\nThe club\u2019s new transfer structure is focusing on two areas in particular \u2013 a dynamic, energetic midfielder and competition for Andre Onana in the goalkeeper department.\nBrighton\u2019s Carlos Baleba has long been a target. One source described him as the \u201cperfect player\u201d for Amorim\u2019s high-octane style of play. Any deal could prove expensive, however, with Brighton reluctant to sell.\nThere are high hopes for Kobbie Mainoo in the heart of the United midfield, but Amorim has taken time to warm to the Mancunian youngster, with concerns raised over the 20-year-old\u2019s ability to run to the level required by the new United boss.\nHowever, after putting in the work over the summer with the help of private coaches, Amorim is understood to have been impressed by Mainoo\u2019s improved physical attributes in pre-season.\nManuel Ugarte has been given the nod alongside Mainoo in several friendlies, but has looked a yard off it \u2013 as he did last season. Captain Bruno Fernandes is likely to play further forward, Casemiro is not getting any younger, while Toby Collyer is still raw. Baleba could be the catalyst for real, lasting change.\nOne cheaper purchase could be another goalkeeper. The i Paper understands, however, that Paris Saint-Germain stopper Gianluigi Donnarumma is not a viable option, despite rumours to the contrary.\nAfter Sesko, sales will be needed to supplement another big-money move. If they can free up some funds, the club are more likely to go for a younger, more inexperienced keeper to provide cover for Onana. As it stands, United plan to go into the new campaign with the Cameroonian as their No 1.\nOnana is understood to be recovering from a hamstring injury that kept him out of United\u2019s pre-season tour of the United States and could line up against Arsenal on the Premier League\u2019 curtain raiser\u2019s opening weekend.\nWho is nearing the exit?\nTime to start fundraising. After Marcus Rashford sealed a loan move to Barcelona, four players who told the club they want to leave \u2013 Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia \u2013 remain on the roster.\nGarnacho, however, is expected to make his exit soon. Chelsea have stepped up their interest for the winger they believe will complete a successful summer window for them. United and Chelsea remain apart on valuation, but a compromise is expected to be found, with the Argentine forward keen to engineer a move to another top Premier League side.\nSancho is another whose Old Trafford misery could be about to end. Inter are understood to have entered the race, with Juventus also still keen. Borussia Dortmund are considering making a loan proposal, for what would be the 25-year-old\u2019s third spell in Germany. United would prefer a permanent sale but will do anything they can to get the wantaway\u2019s wages off their books.\nYour next read\nAnother player outside the \u201cbomb squad\u201d group who is now likely to leave is Rasmus Hojlund. After failing to live up to the billing, United could accept a bid as low as \u00a330m to allow Hojlund to leave, The i Paper understands, with Sesko, Joshua Zirkzee and the highly-rated Chido Obi all competing for one position.\nThe former Atalanta striker has insisted he is willing to fight for his place in the team but, with other options available, United could cash in and use the money to reinvest. Hojlund still has a sound reputation in Italy and could secure a return there this summer.\nBirmingham or Wrexham? I know which club I\u2019m backing for promotion"
