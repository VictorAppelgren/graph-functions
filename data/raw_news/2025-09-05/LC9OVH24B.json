  "description": "Investors are bracing for a make-or-break August jobs reading, with an interest rate cut now seen as all but certain.",
  "content": "US stock futures climbed on Friday as investors waited for the pivotal monthly jobs report to confirm or contradict the softness shown in this week's labor data, with an interest-rate cut now seen as all but certain.\n\nS&P 500 futures (ES=F) were up 0.2%, coming off a fresh all-time closing high for the broad stock benchmark. Contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) leant slightly higher, while those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) led gains, up 0.4%.\n\nThe final countdown to the August jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics is on, with the data due at 8:30 a.m. ET. The report is expected to confirm recent signs the labor market is cooling and unemployment has ticked up.\n\nWall Street is now almost certain that a rate cut is coming at the Federal Reserve's September meeting, with traders pricing in a 99% chance of a reduction. If the August jobs report extends a recent run of weak labor data, however, it could reshape how deep or how fast the Fed cuts rates.\n\nOn Thursday, stocks rose as a rise in jobless claims and slowing private sector jobs growth amped up anticipation for the August jobs figures.\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump's pick for Fed governor, Stephen Miran, said at a Senate hearing that he didn't plan on withdrawing from his White House role even if he is confirmed to the central bank. Trump also kept up pressure on Fed governor Lisa Cook as well as an FTC commissioner in his quest to oust both officials.\n\nOn the trade front, while the Supreme Court considers hearing a case that could invalidate most of Trump's tariffs, the president signed an order Thursday implementing the US trade deal with Japan. The pact sets 15% tariffs on imports from the country.\n\nRead more: The latest on Trump's tariffs\n\nAfter the market close, Lululemon (LULU) stock dived after the apparel retailer slashed forecasts, citing waning demand and tariff woes. Broadcom (AVGO) shares drifted up as its earnings showcased soaring AI chip demand.",

      "text": "Stephen Miran pledged to lawmakers Thursday that he will act independently if he were confirmed as a new governor on the Federal Reserve Board, but he won't step down from his current White House post.\nHe said that he was counseled to take a leave of absence as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers if confirmed to serve on the central bank and then return to the White House after his term is up.\n\"I have received advice from counsel that what is required is an unpaid leave of absence from the Council of Economic Advisers,\" Miran said. He would take the post recently abandoned by Adriana Kugler that expires on Jan. 31.\n\"Considering the term for which I'm being nominated is a little bit more than four months, that is what I would be taking. As long as that is the advice of counsel, I'll follow the law.\"\nSome lawmakers expressed skepticism that Miran would be able to act independently while maintaining his White House post.\n\"You're going to be technically an employee of the president of the United States, an independent member of the board of the Federal Reserve. That's ridiculous,\" Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) said.\nMiran said that if he were nominated for a term longer than four months, he would resign from the Council of Economic Advisers.\nSen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) asked if the president would have him continue to serve as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers if Miran didn't vote the way the president wanted.\n\"I do not know the inside of anyone else's mind,\" Miran said. \"What I can tell you is that if I am confirmed in the Federal Reserve, I will act independently based on my own independent analysis of the economy and climate policy.\"\nIn an essay last March for the Manhattan Institute, Miran called for reforms to recalibrate the Fed's governance to ensure it \"remains insulated from day-to-day politics while enhancing its accountability and democratic legitimacy.\"\nSpecifically, he called for increasing the president's oversight of the Fed, shortening governors' current 14-year terms, and imposing bans on what he called the revolving door between the executive branch and the Fed. He proposed that Fed members should be prohibited from serving in the executive branch for four years following the end of their term.\nMiran also called for nationalizing the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks and giving the governors of the states in their districts the power to select each regional Fed's board of directors, which in turn would select the president of the regional Fed bank.\nBoth Republicans and Democrats questioned Miran about the independence of the Fed during a more than two-hour hearing on Thursday.\n\"I think the Federal Reserve needs to remain quite and completely clear in its independence,\" said Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), noting that what Miran told him in private about upholding Fed independence still stands.\nMiran told Scott he \"couldn't be more in agreement that independence of the central bank is of paramount importance for the economy, for financial markets, for the long run stewardship of the country.\"\nIn a heated exchange, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tried to test whether Miran is independent with a series of questions, including whether President Trump won the election in 2020, to which Miran repeatedly said Congress certified that President Joe Biden won.\nMiran was also asked whether the Bureau of Labor Statistics faked numbers to make them look good under Biden.\n\"Just two straightforward questions about your independence, and you've blown both of them,\" Warren said.\nInvoking Warren, Republican Sen. John Kennedy asked Miran, \"Are you Donald Trump's puppet?\" Miran replied, \"No, I will continue to be independent in my thinking process.\"\nKennedy said, \"We're gonna hold you to that. You need to call them like you see them.\"\nRepublican Sen. Mike Rounds asked Miran whether it's fair for the president to lobby the Fed to move things in a direction he believes can move the economy in a better direction.\nMiran said he felt it was important to hear a variety of views, including opposing views, to make the right decision on policy, which would include allowing the president to lobby.\nMiran's nomination to replace former Fed governor Adriana Kugler's seat was always a chance for Trump to shape the Federal Reserve. But with the president's contested firing of Fed governor Lisa Cook, the deliberations are becoming much more heated.\nWarren and all Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee sent a letter last Friday to committee chair Tim Scott to postpone consideration of all Federal Reserve nominees following what they called Trump's attempt to \"illegally fire\" Fed governor Cook.\nInstead of moving forward with Miran's nomination to the Fed, Banking Committee Democrats urged Scott to hold a hearing on the economic implications of President Trump's attacks on central bank independence for American families.\nWarren has called Trump's firing of governor Cook \"an authoritarian power grab that blatantly violates the Federal Reserve Act, and must be overturned in court.\"\nThe confirmation hearing comes as a federal judge is expected to decide shortly whether the president can fire Lisa Cook for cause as a Federal Reserve governor because of allegations of mortgage fraud.\nIf President Trump is successful in his attempt to fire Cook for cause, he has suggested Miran could be considered for Cook's seat \u2014 a lengthier term at the Fed that won't expire until 2038.\n\"We might switch him to the other \u2014 it's a longer term,\" the president said during a Cabinet meeting last week.\nTD Cowen's Jaret Seiberg said, \"Both developments could give President Trump control over monetary policy, including whether to substantially reduce interest rates. It also opens the door for Trump to take control of the Federal Reserve banks.\"\nThe committee has voted to advance nominees the following week after confirmation hearings with, for instance, SEC Chair Paul Atkins. The same could happen here, with Miran being voted out of committee next Wednesday or Thursday. That would be followed by a floor vote in the full Senate soon after to have Miran in place for the next Fed policy meeting on Sept. 16-17.\nMiran's appointment would add not only a Trump administration official to the Fed board, but also another member who is in favor of the central bank cutting interest rates as soon as its September policy meeting.\nJennifer Schonberger is a veteran financial journalist covering markets, the economy, and investing.

      "text": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump asked the US Supreme Court to let him fire the only remaining Democrat on the Federal Trade Commission, teeing up a case that could overturn a 90-year-old precedent and give the White House tighter control over federal regulators.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n-\nOne of World\u2019s Most Liveable Cities Ends Euro-a-Day Travel Pass\n-\nPhiladelphia Transit Cuts Portend \u2018Mayhem\u2019 for Commutes and Regional Economy\n-\nSelf-Driving Cars Take a Turn Toward the Villainous, in Movies and Real Life\nThe appeal tests a 1935 Supreme Court ruling that said Congress could insulate at least some high-ranking officials from being fired. The Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority has chipped away at that ruling but so far has stopped short of directly reversing it.\nThe filing follows a federal appeals court decision Tuesday reinstating FTC Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, who is challenging Trump\u2019s attempt to oust her. The administration asked the high court both to allow Slaughter\u2019s immediate removal and to grant full review and issue a definitive ruling.\nThe clash coincides with Trump\u2019s effort to push out Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for alleged mortgage fraud, a dispute that raises different legal issues. In the FTC case, Trump contends he has the constitutional right to fire Slaughter for any reason.\nTrump sought to remove Slaughter from her position in March. She sued, arguing that her ouster flouted the FTC Act, which says a president can remove commissioners only for cause, such as inefficiency or neglect of duty. A federal judge in Washington ruled in her favor in July, and her status has been in limbo ever since.\nHer attempted removal represents the most direct challenge yet to the 1935 Humphrey\u2019s Executor ruling, which stemmed from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s firing of a Republican FTC commissioner. The court\u2019s ruling against Roosevelt paved the way for the independent agencies that came to proliferate across the US government.\nConservatives have long opposed Humphrey\u2019s Executor as undermining the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers, and they\u2019ve gained traction in recent years. The Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that the president could fire the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, saying such a powerful executive branch figure has to be accountable to the president.\nMore recently, the Supreme Court has let Trump remove members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The court suggested along the way that Trump\u2019s power wouldn\u2019t extend to firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell \u2014 at least in the absence of a legitimate reason like misconduct."

Lower borrowing costs tend to boost the appeal of non-yielding gold, which has also seen support from strong haven demand amid concerns over the US central bank\u2019s future.\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n-\nOne of World\u2019s Most Liveable Cities Ends Euro-a-Day Travel Pass\n-\nPhiladelphia Transit Cuts Portend \u2018Mayhem\u2019 for Commutes and Regional Economy\n-\nSelf-Driving Cars Take a Turn Toward the Villainous, in Movies and Real Life\nInvestors are now bracing for a pivotal US payrolls report on Friday, which is expected to extend the weakest stretch of US job growth since the pandemic. That would add to signs of a softening labor market, with Treasury yields declining to the lowest levels in several months following data on Thursday that showed US jobless claims rose to the highest since June.\nWhile technical measures show gold reached overbought levels this week, the metal is still up by more than a third this year \u2014 making it one of the best-performing major commodities. The latest run higher came after Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month cautiously opened the door to a cut.\nBoth gold and silver have more than doubled over the past three years, with mounting risks in geopolitics, the economy and global trade driving have demand. An escalation in President Donald Trump\u2019s attacks against the Fed this year has increased worries over the central bank\u2019s independence, as the president has vowed to gain a \u201cmajority, very shortly\u201d on the central bank and bring down rates.\nStill, some of those concerns were allayed after Stephen Miran \u2014 whom Trump has picked to fill a vacant seat on the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors \u2014 on Thursday told a Senate confirmation hearing that the central bank\u2019s most important job is preventing depressions and hyperinflation. He also reiterated his commitment to central bank independence, even as he acknowledged he would retain his White House job.\nInvestors are also still waiting for a landmark ruling on whether Trump has legitimate grounds to remove Fed Governor Lisa Cook, which could allow the president to replace her with a dovish-leaning official. On that theme, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts wrote in a note this week that gold could rally to almost $5,000 an ounce if the Fed\u2019s independence were damaged and investors shifted just a small portion of holdings from Treasuries into bullion."

      "text": "US stocks pushed higher on Thursday as Wall Street awaited an all-important jobs report, with risks to Federal Reserve independence also in focus as a Senate hearing to confirm Stephen Miran took place.\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.8% to eke out a fresh record of 6,502.08, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) climbed nearly 1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also gained nearly 0.8%. The moves come after stocks mostly closed higher on Wednesday.\nFresh jobs data Thursday showed private sector job growth slowed dramatically in August. Private payrolls grew by 54,000, according to the monthly report from ADP. That was less than estimates for 65,000. Also, weekly jobless claims rose above estimates, hitting their highest level since June.\nElsewhere, a report from the Institute for Supply Management showed economic activity in the services sector rising more than expected. But it also found sluggish hiring in the sector, as the report said employment shrank for the third consecutive month.\nTogether, data served as the latest sign of shakiness in the labor market after July job openings were lower than expected, fueling confidence that Fed officials will lower rates at their September meeting. Traders are pricing in a 97% chance of a cut as of Thursday morning, compared with around 91.7% Wednesday before the JOLTS data was released.\nWall Street is now bracing for the August jobs report, due Friday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. More evidence of stress could make the case for deeper rate cuts than currently priced in.\nMeanwhile, President Trump's campaign to recast the Fed in pursuit of rate cuts faced a test in the Senate, at a hearing to confirm his pick Stephen Miran for governor at the central bank. Miran faced questions over Fed independence, and he potentially opened himself up to more scrutiny when he said would not resign from his current post at the White House if confirmed to the Fed board.\nOn the corporate front, American Eagle (AEO) shares soared after the apparel retailer predicted a sales boost thanks to ads featuring actress Sydney Sweeney and NFL player Travis Kelce.\nBroadcom (AVGO), Lululemon (LULU), and DocuSign (DOCU) are set to report earnings on Thursday.\nLIVE COVERAGE IS OVER 22 updatesMiran says he plans to take leave from White House job if confirmed to Fed board\nStephen Miran, President Trump's nominee for the Federal Reserve board, said Thursday that if confirmed to the central bank position, he does not intend to resign from his White House post.\nInstead, Miran said he plans to take an unpaid leave of absence from his role in the White House, where he serves as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers.\nSuch an arrangement would be unprecedented and could open up Miran to more scrutiny about his independence from the administration \u2014 and the overall independence of the central bank.\n\"That's ridiculous,\" Sen. Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island, said after his questioning brought out Miran's answer, which Miran said he gave at the advice of legal counsel.\nIf confirmed, Miran's appointment would \u2014 for now \u2014 only run through the end of the year. But in the past, Miran himself has criticized what he has termed as a revolving door of sorts between the executive branch and central bank.\nWatch below:"

It may sound like we are in a normal year, but we are not. The first half of the year included a sharp sell-off in the Information Technology sector due to AI competition from China, as well as near trip into a bear market as investors hit the sell button as tariff talk began. But tariff talk turned out to be largely just that (more talk than actual tariffs, at least thus far) and investors have refocused on the positive fundamentals of a growing economy, expanding earnings, and declining interest rates.

Below are the Top-10 performers from the Argus Universe in2Q, with representatives from four of the 11 major sectors, as well as the Bottom-Five performers.\nThe Argus Dividend Growth Model Portfolio\nDividend income is often overlooked amid gyrations in the stock market. Consider that in 2024, market bulls were boasting about 24%-plus S&P 500 returns. No one was very focused on the broad market index's 1.2% dividend yield. But dividends are an important element of return, and 2025 is bearing that out. Through May, the S&P 500 was up a thin 1.1%; without dividends, there was essentially no returns at all. Indeed, dividend income accounted for 42% of the total return of the S&P 500 between 1930 and 2012, according to Hartford Funds. And that's just the average. In some of those decades, dividends accounted for more than 50% of total returns and even 100% of returns. More recently, dividends have accounted for a smaller portion of returns, at around 15%-20%. Not for nothing, in 2022, dividend payments softened the blow when most market indices turned bearish as the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates. We saw that pattern in 2018 as well. Not all dividends are created equal, though, and it is important to understand the difference between the two main investment categories: high-yield stocks and dividend-growth stocks.\nTop Analysts: AVGO\nView MoreOverall Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest for AVGO overall weighted by direction, price target, and price movement.\nLearn MoreDirection Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest on predicting the directional movement of AVGO.\nLearn MorePrice Score\nDiscover which analysts rank highest on predicting the price target of AVGO.\nLearn More"

      "text": "The US labor market is slowing down.\nAfter a round of weaker-than-expected job market figures this week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will release the August jobs report on Friday morning at 8:30 a.m. ET. The report is expected to confirm these trends seen elsewhere in the US economy.\nEconomists expect the US economy added 75,000 jobs in August while the unemployment rate is expected to have risen to 4.3%, according to data from Bloomberg. Economists are also expecting hourly earnings to have increased 0.3% over the prior month in August and 3.7% over last year.\nIn July, the economy created 73,000 new jobs, but the headline that emerged from that report was revisions to job gains in May and June, which wiped out some 258,000 previously reported gains.\nFollowing that report, President Trump removed the head of the BLS, Erika McEntarfer. Trump later nominated EJ Antoni, chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, to take the role.\n\"We continue to see softness growing in the labor market as tariff policy uncertainty lingers, immigration changes take effect, and AI adoption grows,\" Eric Teal, chief investment officer of Comerica Wealth Management, wrote in an email on Thursday.\n\"The silver-lining is the weaker the jobs data the more cover there is for stimulative interest rate cuts that are on the horizon.\"\nFriday's report will come after data out Thursday from private payroll provider ADP showed there were 54,000 private sector jobs created last month, while data from the Labor Department showed initial filings for unemployment insurance tallied 237,000 last week, the most since June.\nThe results will be closely watched as the Federal Reserve looks increasingly likely to cut rates in September after months of inaction. Traders are pricing in a more than 95% chance of a cut as of Thursday morning, according to data from the CME Group.\nRead more: How jobs, inflation, and the Fed are all related\n\"This week\u2019s ADP payrolls, weekly unemployment claims, and JOLTS all corroborate the developing view of marginal deterioration in the labor market,\" Jordan Rizzuto, managing partner and chief investment officer of GammaRoad Capital Partners, wrote in a note on Thursday.\n\"This further supports market expectations for a rate cut at the Fed\u2019s September meeting, particularly given Powell\u2019s comments at Jackson Hole regarding the FOMC\u2019s increasing emphasis on employment conditions.\"\nJake Conley is a breaking news reporter covering US equities for Yahoo Finance.

Investors welcomed the news, sending shares up 4% in after-hours trading, as Tan is widely credited with transforming Broadcom into one of the world's most valuable chip designers.\nTan had hinted at four new potential customers earlier this year who were \"deeply engaged\" with the company to create their own custom chips, in addition to its three existing large clients.\nLast quarter, a new prospect placed a firm order, turning it into a qualified customer, Tan said on an earnings call without disclosing the buyer's name.\nBroadcom has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the generative AI boom, with hyperscale customers that own data centers looking for alternatives to pricier Nvidia chips. Broadcom helps design custom AI chips.\n\"Broadcom's custom offerings for cloud giants are well-positioned as Big Tech races to push model training and inference forward, Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said.\n\"While Nvidia's GPUs remain the default choice, custom silicon can deliver niche performance gains that help break through bottlenecks,\" he said.\nInvestors have placed high expectations on AI-focused chip firms, betting on their expanding product lineup to fuel rapid growth.\nThis year Broadcom has launched the Tomahawk Ultra networking chip and a next-generation Jericho networking chip to speed up AI compute, as part of its push to challenge Nvidia's dominance in the AI semiconductor industry.\nBroadcom shares have surged nearly 82% since the start of April, building on a more than threefold jump in the past two years, while Nvidia has gained 27% in 2025.\n\"We expect growth in AI semiconductor revenue to accelerate to $6.2 billion in Q4,\" Tan said. AI revenue grew 63% to $5.2 billion in the third quarter ended August 3.\nWhile AI demand continues to soar, Tan flagged weakness in the non-AI semiconductor business, with the enterprise networking and service storage units down sequentially.\nBroadcom expects fourth-quarter revenue to be around $17.4 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $17.01 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.\nIts third-quarter revenue of $15.95 billion beat the estimate of $15.83 billion.\n(Reporting by Zaheer Kachwala in Bengaluru; Editing by Shilpi Majumdar)"

      "text": "By Neil J Kanatt\n(Reuters) -Lululemon Athletica slashed its annual profit forecast for the second quarter in a row, blaming weak U.S. business and product issues, as well as tariff costs.\nShares of the yogawear maker, which also cut its annual sales forecast, fell about 15% after the closing bell.\nThe company's attempts to boost sales and fight competition with weekly product launches have failed to spark a wave of buying from shoppers, as it steps into the holiday-focused second half of the year.\n\"Once the trailblazer in athleisure, Lululemon has lost its innovation edge, now squeezed by luxury newcomers like Alo Yoga and private-label dupes with comparable fabric tech at lower prices,\" said Suzy Davidkhanian, analyst at eMarketer.\n\"Copycat culture highlights how far the moat has shrunk.\"\nLululemon's struggles with merchandise management \u2014 including a heavier focus on its ailing products like lounge and social wear, and its failure to effectively tap into seasonal trends \u2014 have caused its American shoppers to turn away.\n\"While we continued to see positive momentum overall in our international regions ... we are disappointed with our U.S. business results and aspects of our product execution,\" CEO Calvin McDonald said in a statement.\n\"We have let our product life cycles run too long within many of our core categories,\" McDonald added on a post-earnings call.\nThe dour forecast comes as U.S. holiday spending is expected to see its steepest drop since the pandemic, according to a PwC survey.\nThe company, including mitigation efforts, expects an impact of about $240 million on its 2025 gross profit from higher tariffs and the removal of the de minimis exemption. It sees a hit of around $320 million on its operating margin in 2026.\nDe minimis is a U.S. customs exemption that allows duty-free entry and minimal paperwork for international shipments under $800. The exemption removal became effective on August 29.\nLululemon fulfills about two-thirds of its U.S. e-commerce orders, and used the exemption through distribution centers in Canada, it said in the earnings call.\nThe company now expects annual revenue between $10.85 billion and $11 billion, compared to its previous outlook of $11.15 billion to $11.30.\nAnnual profit per share is now expected between $12.77 and $12.97, compared with previous expectations of $14.58 to $14.78 apiece.\nLululemon is sticking to its plan to take strategic price hikes in the U.S. market to reduce the tariff impact, even as it increases markdowns overall, to clear inventory."
