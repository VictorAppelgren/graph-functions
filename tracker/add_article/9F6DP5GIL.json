Speculation includes a $50 price hike across the lineup, a shift to 256 GB base storage, and a single‑camera Air variant with a 2,800 mAh battery. The event is expected to unveil iOS 26, featuring a Liquid Glass design, live translation, and Visual Intelligence, while Apple may also reveal new Apple Watch and AirPods models. These developments are likely to influence UST yields, the DXY, and tech equity indices in the coming weeks as investors weigh pricing and supply‑chain shifts amid U.S. tariff concerns.",
