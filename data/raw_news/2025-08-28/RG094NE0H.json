  "description": "Arch Manning is prepared to lead No. 1 Texas against No. 3 Ohio State as former Longhorns running back Bijan Robinson believes the quarterback won't be affected by the big moment.",
  "content": "The first Saturday of the 2025 college football season kicks off with No. 1 Texas heading to No. 3 Ohio State in a matchup that will have all eyes watching, especially on the Longhorns sideline.\n\nArch Manning, the nephew of Super Bowl champions Peyton and Eli Manning, has been highly publicized this offseason as Texas\u2019 offense will now run through him. The redshirt sophomore carries lofty expectations, but one former Longhorn believes he\u2019s built for the moment.\n\nBijan Robinson, the Atlanta Falcons star running back, knows what it takes to succeed at Texas, and he\u2019s confident that Manning understands exactly what must be done this Saturday and every week afterward to achieve the ultimate goal of a national title.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\n\"His family, man, he\u2019s been around it his entire life,\" Robinson told Fox News Digital while promoting College Colors Day, which falls on Aug. 29. \"So, this moment right here isn\u2019t too big for him.\"\n\nManning grew up watching his uncles grind through the trials of the NFL \u2014 seeing them fail in tough moments but also rise to win the Vince Lombardi Trophy.\n\nPeyton said earlier this offseason on \"The Pat McAfee Show\" that his father, Cooper Manning, prepared Arch to reach this stage in his football journey. As an uncle, Peyton said he\u2019s merely acted as a guide when needed.\n\n\"I feel like there\u2019s no moment that\u2019s too big when you play at Texas,\" Robinson said. \"The outside world can make it huge, but when we\u2019re there and on the field, God gave us all a gift to go out there and just produce and have fun doing it.\n\n\"So, with [Manning], I\u2019m excited to see what he can do because his confidence is huge and he\u2019s been around the game for so long. He\u2019s been around Super Bowls with his uncles and stuff like that, man. This game won\u2019t affect him at all, and I think he\u2019s prepared for it and everyone around him is prepared for it.\"\n\nPlaying in \"The Horseshoe\" in Columbus, Ohio, can be a daunting task, but Robinson is confident there will be plenty of Longhorns\u2019 burnt orange in the stands.\n\n\"Lucky for us playing at Texas, there\u2019s going to be a lot of Texas fans at that game,\" Robinson said with a smile. \"You\u2019re going to see a lot of burnt orange. It\u2019s pretty incredible that we travel so well. We\u2019re the most hated team when we show up in the stadium. It doesn\u2019t matter who we\u2019re playing, they\u2019re going to find a way to hate us. But our fans travel extremely well. There are some games where we\u2019ll have more Texas fans than the home team, which is pretty special.\"\n\nThese days, Robinson looks out to a sea of red and black when he takes the field in Atlanta. But this weekend, he\u2019ll be repping his old college colors \u2014 something he\u2019s encouraging all fans to do this Friday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDeveloped by collegiate brand licensing leader CLC, Aug. 29 marks College Colors Day, a nationwide call for fans to \"Flip the Switch\" and show support for their favorite college football team.\n\n\"For everybody that\u2019s a fan, I feel like it\u2019s really important to wear your colors and represent your school,\" Robinson said.\n\nFollow Fox News Digital\u2019s sports coverage on X, and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.",

      "text": "Archibald Charles Manning, born April 27, 2004, is a quarterback for the Texas Longhorns from New Orleans, Louisiana.\nHe is the nephew of former NFL superstars Peyton Manning and Eli Manning and the grandson of former New Orleans Saints quarterback Archie Manning. Arch went to high school at Isidore Newman High School where he was named MaxPreps National Freshman of the Year.\nIn November 2023, Arch played in a regular-season college game at Texas for the first time against Texas Tech. In 2024, rumors swirled that he was leaving the Longhorns and transferring elsewhere. However, Arch shut down those rumors during a media session.\n\"Obviously, there\u2019s all these rumors, but I haven\u2019t looked into transferring at all. I\u2019m just focused on developing and helping this team in any way I can, and, hopefully, one day playing for the University of Texas like I always wanted to,\" Manning said via The Athletic."

Manning\u2019s early starts last season, where he posted solid passing and rushing numbers, have positioned him as a potential Heisman candidate and a key driver for Texas\u2019s quest for a national title. The game, scheduled for Saturday at the Horseshoe, is seen as a chance for Texas to exact revenge on Ohio State, who eliminated them in the 2024 playoff semifinals. Robinson and other commentators emphasize that Manning\u2019s confidence and experience should keep him unfazed by the high expectations and the pressure of a marquee matchup.",
