  "content": "JERUSALEM \u2014 Israel said Friday it will intensify its 22-month war with Hamas by taking over Gaza City, drawing a dismissal from the militant group and renewed international calls to end the conflict, while stirring fears for Palestinian civilians and Israeli hostages still held in Gaza.\n\nIsrael\u2019s air and ground war has killed tens of thousands of people in Gaza, displaced most of the population, destroyed vast areas and pushed the territory toward famine. The timing of another major ground operation is unclear. It will likely require mobilizing thousands of troops and forcibly evacuating civilians, almost certainly exacerbating the humanitarian catastrophe.\n\nAn official familiar with the plans to take over Gaza City said the operation would be \u201cgradual\u201d and that there is no start date. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.\n\nMediators from Egypt and Qatar are working on a new framework that will include the release of all hostages - dead and alive - in one go in return for an end of the war in Gaza and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the strip, two Arab officials told The Associated Press.\n\nBefore Israel\u2019s Security Cabinet approved the plan to take over Gaza City, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had outlined more sweeping plans Thursday in an interview with Fox News, saying Israel planned to take control of all of Gaza. Israel already controls around three-quarters of the territory.\n\nHamas rejected Israel\u2019s plans. \u201cExpanding of aggression against our Palestinian people will not be a walk in the park,\u201d the group said in a statement.\n\nInternational powers, including Israeli allies, have stepped up criticism of the war amid mounting shock over media reports showing starvation.\n\nGermany said Friday it would not authorize the export of military equipment that could be used in Gaza until further notice.\n\nTensions could rise further if Netanyahu follows through on the more sweeping plans to take control of the entire territory, two decades after Israel\u2019s unilateral withdrawal.\n\nAsked in the interview with Fox News ahead of the Security Cabinet meeting if Israel would \u201ctake control of all of Gaza,\u201d Netanyahu replied: \u201cWe intend to, in order to assure our security, remove Hamas there.\u201d He added that Israel did not intend to \u201ckeep it.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s new plan may be aimed in part at pressuring Hamas to accept a ceasefire on Israel\u2019s terms.\n\nIt may also reflect the reservations of Israel\u2019s military chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, who reportedly warned that expanding operations would endanger the remaining 20 or so living hostages held by Hamas and further strain Israel\u2019s army after nearly two years of regional wars.\n\nThe military \u201cwill prepare to take control of Gaza City while providing humanitarian aid to the civilian population outside the combat zones,\u201d Netanyahu\u2019s office said in a statement after the Security Cabinet meeting.\n\nAmir Avivi, a retired brigadier general and chairman of Israel\u2019s Defense and Security Forum, estimated it would take less than three months to mobilize some 30,000 troops, evacuate Palestinian civilians and take over Gaza City.\n\nHamas-led militants triggered the war when they stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing around 1,200 people and abducting 251 people. Most of the hostages have been released in ceasefires or other deals but 50 remain inside Gaza. Israel believes around 20 of them to be alive.\n\nIsrael\u2019s retaliatory campaign has killed over 61,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters or civilians. The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals.\n\nThe United Nations and independent experts view the ministry\u2019s figures as the most reliable estimate of casualties. Israel has disputed them without offering a toll of its own.\n\nThe efforts for a new ceasefire have the backing of major Arab Gulf monarchies, according to two officials who spoke anonymously due to the sensitivity of the discussions. One is involved directly in the deliberations and the second was briefed on the efforts. The monarchies are concerned about further regional destabilization if Israel fully reoccupies Gaza, the officials said.\n\nThe yet-to-be finalized framework aims to address the contentious issue of what to do with Hamas\u2019 weapons, with Israel seeking full disarmament and Hamas refusing. The official directly involved in the efforts said discussions are underway about \u201cfreezing arms,\u201d which may involve Hamas retaining but not using its weapons. It also calls for the group to relinquish power in the strip.\n\nA Palestinian-Arab committee would run Gaza and oversee the reconstruction efforts until the establishment of a Palestinian administration with a new police force, trained by two U.S. allies in the Middle East, to take over the strip, the official said. It is unclear what role the Western-backed Palestinian Authority would play.\n\nThe second official said the U.S. administration has been briefed on the broad lines of the framework.\n\nA senior Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn\u2019t authorized to brief the media, said the group has yet to receive details on the latest efforts to revive ceasefire talks.\n\nAP reached out to the governments in Qatar, Egypt and Israel as well as the White House for comment.\n\nU.S. envoy Steve Witkoff told hostage families during his recent visit that Israel was shifting its approach to pursue a comprehensive \u201call-or-nothing\u201d deal aimed at ending the war and securing the release of hostages, a person who attended the meeting told the AP, speaking on the condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak about the private meeting.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly bombarded Gaza City and carried out numerous raids there, only to return to neighborhoods again and again as militants regrouped. Today, it is one of the few areas in Gaza that hasn\u2019t been turned into an Israeli buffer zone or placed under evacuation orders.\n\nUmm Youssef from Gaza City said she had left the city for over 16 months before returning to her home.\n\n\u2019The area is all rubble. Rubble is an overstatement, it is a sandpile. There is nothing here to occupy. There is no life here,\u201d she said.\n\nA major ground operation there could displace tens of thousands of people and further disrupt efforts to deliver food to the hunger-stricken territory.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how many people are still in Gaza City, the territory\u2019s largest before the war. Hundreds of thousands fled under evacuation orders in the opening weeks of the conflict, but many returned during a ceasefire at the start of this year.\n\nShurafa reported from Deir al-Balah, Gaza Strip, and Magdy from Cairo.
