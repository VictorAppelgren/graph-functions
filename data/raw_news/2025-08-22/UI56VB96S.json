  "title": "Thursday Murder Club 2 \u2013 Helen Mirren speaks out on The Man Who Died Twice movie",
  "description": "Dame Helen Mirren has spoken out on The Thursday Murder Club 2, which would be a film adaptation of Richard Osman's second novel, The Man Who Died Twice.",
  "content": "Following last night\u2019s London premiere, the film adaptation of Richard Osman\u2019s novel, The Thursday Murder Club, is now out in cinemas ahead of its Netflix debut next week. Despite a lukewarm reception in the reviews, the Steven Spielberg-produced film will undoubtedly be a hit on the streaming service as a cosy watch at home. And so comes the inevitable question of, will there be a Thursday Murder Club 2? Dame Helen Mirren, who stars as retired MI6 spy Elizabeth, told the Radio Times: \u201c[I\u2019d do another] in a nanosecond. And it would be the team getting back together, which would be great. \u201cWe did have a wonderful time shooting this. So all of us would jump at the chance, quite honestly.\u201d\n\nGiven Netflix\u2019s success with Rian Johnson\u2019s Knives Out murder mysteries starring Daniel Craig\u2019s Benoit Blanc, we\u2019d expect there to be plenty more from the Thursday Murder Club. After all, there are four more of Osman\u2019s books and counting to adapt, starting with the second novel The Man Who Died Twice. The book\u2019s synopsis reads: \u201cIn The Man Who Died Twice, the Thursday Murder Club gets back into action when someone Elizabeth used to know comes looking for help. He's in hiding after being accused of stealing millions in diamonds from a man known for his connections to the criminal underworld. When dead bodies soon start piling up, these crime-solving pensioners must kick things into high gear, figure out who's behind off of this and hopefully locate some shiny diamonds as well.\u201d\n\nAfter The Man Who Died Twice, Mirren, Pierce Brosnan, Sir Ben Kingsley and Celia Imrie could also return in The Bullet That Missed, The Last Devil to Die and the upcoming fifth story, The Impossible Fortune, which is published on September 25. The Thursday Murder Club is out now in select cinemas and will be streaming on Netflix from August 28.",

      "text": "The Thursday Murder Club\u2019s Helen Mirren reveals \"real chemistry\" with co-star: \"Pierce is my wonderful late discovery\"\nHelen Mirren says that filming The Thursday Murder Club was a magical moment in her career.\nThis article first appeared in Radio Times magazine.\nWas making The Thursday Murder Club as much fun as it looks?\nIt was a wonderful coming together of the tribe \u2013 one of those magical moments in a career. Ben and I started out together in the Royal Shakespeare Company, both ambitious and obsessed. Celia and I became really good friends on Calendar Girls [2003]. I didn\u2019t know Pierce before making this and the Paramount+ series MobLand, but we both did street theatre before he went off and became a massive movie star with James Bond. There was a synchronicity.\nHow did you and Pierce behave with each other on those two different shoots?\nThey are totally different characters, but Pierce and I have a very similar way of working, which is serious without being too serious about ourselves. Neither of us is what you would call a method actor. We find a nice, comfortable seat to sit in with our scripts and just chill together. Pierce is my wonderful late discovery. I\u2019d like to work with Pierce for the rest of my life. I feel that we have a real chemistry.\nIs sexual attraction a necessary part of that on-screen chemistry?\nThere is a bit of that in there, but it\u2019s never the whole thing. Strangely, people with great sexual attraction to each other off-screen can have absolutely nothing on-screen. It\u2019s very weird. And people who really don\u2019t like each other off- screen can have this amazing sexual attraction that the audience can perceive. I guess viewers misread the loathing that they have for each other in real life as a frisson of attraction.\nIs Elizabeth\u2019s steeliness, as you portray her, protection against her fear of ageing?\nPossibly. Elizabeth\u2019s loss of her dear friend in The Thursday Murder Club is intrinsic to the story and it\u2019s heartbreaking. And as you get older, like me, you must confront these tragedies. They come in the most unexpected of ways: sometimes it\u2019s not the person you expect to lose that you lose. You have no idea what\u2019s coming down the line, but it\u2019s getting closer and closer. You could seriously get your knickers in a twist about that, but you just can\u2019t.\nWould you be game to get involved in more Thursday Murder Club adventures?\nIn a nanosecond. And it would be the team getting back together, which would be great. We did have a wonderful time shooting this. So all of us would jump at the chance, quite honestly.\nThe latest issue of Radio Times is out now \u2013 subscribe here.\nCheck out more of our Film coverage or visit our TV Guide and Streaming Guide to find out what's on.
