  "content": "Growing older brings with it some health and convenience-related challenges. If you\u2019re planning to live alone after you retire, consider purchasing these eight items that will allow you to live more comfortably.\n\nCheck Out: Top 5 Things Boomers Should Always Buy in Retirement \u2014 Even If It\u2019s Begrudgingly\n\nRead Next: 7 Wealth-Building Shortcuts Proven To Add $1K to Your Wallet This Month\n\nLiving alone increases the possibility of having a medical emergency that goes unnoticed. A medical alert system monitors vital signs for early detection of health issues, provides access to 24/7 emergency assistance and features fall detection. It\u2019s a great choice if you want to live independently while maintaining safety. Medical alert systems go for as low as $28.99 online.\n\nA home security system is a great way to protect yourself and your belongings. It has an alarm that sounds and alerts authorities during a break-in, which often deters criminals from entering and causing damage or stealing goods. Some include smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors and alert you when things are dangerous. Another positive is that having a home security system can lower your homeowner\u2019s insurance significantly. Home security systems can range from around $55 to over $300, depending on the quality and features.\n\nBe Aware: 4 Retirement Expenses Boomers Didn\u2019t Plan for \u2014 but Should Have\n\nOlder adults, whether living alone or not, can often improve the safety and accessibility of their homes by installing grab bars and handrails throughout. These are especially helpful in slippery or difficult-to-manage areas, such as showers and bathtubs. The primary purpose of grab bars and handrails is to prevent falls and injuries. Handrails will vary in price depending on the quantity and length. Toilet grab bars go for around $40 online.\n\nVoice-controlled smart devices like Google Nest or Alexa can simplify your life in multiple ways. You won\u2019t need to get up to turn on music, lights or the air conditioner, as you can simply speak your orders. They are also great for keeping track of things like scheduled events and medication reminders. Smart home devices vary in price by brand and complexity, from under $100 to hundreds of dollars. They often also require a small monthly subscription.\n\nInstalling motion light sensors can help you avoid problems with seeing when you\u2019re active at night, as they turn on lights when they detect your movements. If you have poor balance, mobility or vision, this can be especially helpful. They can also save you the trouble of fumbling around in the dark looking for the light switch. Motion light sensors can cost as little as $15 or less.\n\nIf you need to take several different medications, it can be confusing to keep track of them all. One solution is an automatic pill dispenser. You can program it to give you the right amount of pills at a set date and time. Many also have a built-in alarm that goes off to remind you when it\u2019s time to take the pill, and some even keep a record of missed or late doses. You can purchase an automatic pill dispenser online for around $60.\n\nKeyless door locks make it easier to enter and exit your house quickly. These are touchscreen locks with codes, and some can even open through smartphone apps. Keyless door locks are excellent choices for people with arthritis or who frequently misplace keys. A keyless door lock goes for around $35 online.\n\nSmart thermostats can keep you comfortable at all times. They work by determining your habits and adjusting the temperatures in specific rooms or areas of your living quarters to maximize your comfort. At the same time, they turn off unnecessary operations to reduce energy use and save you money. These devices are available for just $80 online.\n\nFrom audiobooks to grocery delivery to music and movie streaming, signing up for subscription services makes retired life that much easier and more entertaining. Some can also help with your health. You can use them to order and receive prescriptions or improve your mental health through meditation and sleep subscription services. Subscription services\u2019 costs vary depending on the product or service being sold.\n\nShoes can be too clunky and uncomfortable to wear around the house, but wearing normal socks can increase the chance of falling. Investing in some pairs of grip socks is an excellent solution. These socks have tread patterns on the bottoms that act as grips. They protect against slippage and help with balance as you walk around indoors. You can find functional grip socks online for as little as $6.\n\u2022 3 Luxury SUVs That Will Have Massive Price Drops in Summer 2025\n\u2022 I Paid Off $40,000 in 7 Months Doing These 5 Things\n\u2022 7 Wealth-Building Shortcuts Proven To Add $1K to Your Wallet This Month\n\u2022 6 Low-Risk Ways To Build Your Savings in 2025\n\nThis article originally appeared on GOBankingRates.com: 10 Things Boomers Should Buy in Retirement If They\u2019ll Be Living Alone",

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nRetirement is often viewed with anticipation for many Americans. The daily grind at the office is replaced with thoughts of travel or enjoying hobbies you rarely had time for in your working days.\nUnfortunately, financial realities can make those wishes difficult to enjoy, especially in a time where the economy is fraught with uncertainty. In a recent article on her website, personal finance expert Suze Orman shared things retirees must do to protect their finances.\nHere are four things Orman advised to safeguard your money in retirement.\nDon\u2019t Make Rash Decisions with Your Investment Portfolio\nThe stock market has been full of upheaval in 2025. A key driver to the chaos was President Trump\u2019s Liberation Day for tariffs. The S&P 500, for example, was down nearly 19% from recent highs, representing a loss of over $9 trillion in market value, according to CNN.\nSelling stock holdings during a pullback is understandable, but emotional decisions can betray long-term goals. \u201cI hope you resisted any urge to sell stock holdings during the worst of the market declines earlier this year. Once you lock in lower values, you can\u2019t easily make them up,\u201d said Orman.\nLocking in losses can be particularly troubling for retirees with limited means to recoup losses, especially for people on fixed incomes.\nReanalyze Your Portfolio\nIt\u2019s easy for an investment portfolio to get unaligned during market upheaval. It\u2019s best for retirees to review their portfolio at least annually, or when a position has a wild swing, according to Fidelity. Movement this year provides a good opportunity to do this.\n\u201cIt\u2019s also an opportunity to recalibrate your investment strategy,\u201d noted Orman of the stock market in 2025. Retirees may want to decide if they need to make changes or change their overall approach to their portfolio.\n\u201cIf you were anxious during the market sell-off in the first half of the year, now is a good time to think through whether it is indeed time to reduce your overall allocation to stocks,\u201d added Orman. It\u2019s often best to do this with a trusted financial advisor to ensure decisions are in your best interest.\nHave Enough Cash on Hand\nA common headwind many retirees face is not having a paycheck come in monthly. This makes having ample cash on hand necessary to face challenges like healthcare costs or other emergencies. Orman broke this down to two categories for retirees: living expenses and emergency funds.\nCurrent market upswings may be a good time for retirees to make calculated sales to increase cash on hand. \u201cIf you are already retired, I hope you have at least two to three years of living costs in cash. That\u2019s how you ride out the next wave of market volatility, and the one after that,\u201d said Orman. This will help retirees avoid selling during future downturns.\nThat\u2019s only half of the cash equation, though. \u201cThis cash is in addition to the eight months to one year of living costs you should have to cover emergency savings,\u201d noted Orman. It\u2019s best to house all of these funds in a high-yield savings account to maximize interest-earning possibilities.\nPlan Filing for Social Security Benefits Wisely\nTaking Social Security benefits as soon as possible is understandable, especially in light of concerns of insolvency. Receiving benefits early can be detrimental, though, as it can lead to receiving significantly less.\n\u201cAt your full retirement age (age 67 for everyone born in 1960 or later) your benefit will be 30% larger than if you start at age 62. Moreover, if you wait all the way until you turn 70, your benefit will be 76% higher than if you start at age 62,\u201d Orman said in a recent article on her website. Filing for Social Security benefits is a personal decision, so plan for when it\u2019s best for you without hindering your long-term goals.\nProtecting finances in retirement is of utmost importance. You don\u2019t want to outlive your savings. Wise planning protects against that and avails retirees more opportunities to live the life they want."

You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nGrowing older brings with it some health and convenience-related challenges. If you\u2019re planning to live alone after you retire, consider purchasing these eight items that will allow you to live more comfortably.\nMedical Alert System\nLiving alone increases the possibility of having a medical emergency that goes unnoticed. A medical alert system monitors vital signs for early detection of health issues, provides access to 24/7 emergency assistance and features fall detection. It\u2019s a great choice if you want to live independently while maintaining safety. Medical alert systems go for as low as $28.99 online.\nHome Security System\nA home security system is a great way to protect yourself and your belongings. It has an alarm that sounds and alerts authorities during a break-in, which often deters criminals from entering and causing damage or stealing goods. Some include smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors and alert you when things are dangerous. Another positive is that having a home security system can lower your homeowner\u2019s insurance significantly. Home security systems can range from around $55 to over $300, depending on the quality and features.\nGrab Bars and Handrails\nOlder adults, whether living alone or not, can often improve the safety and accessibility of their homes by installing grab bars and handrails throughout. These are especially helpful in slippery or difficult-to-manage areas, such as showers and bathtubs. The primary purpose of grab bars and handrails is to prevent falls and injuries. Handrails will vary in price depending on the quantity and length. Toilet grab bars go for around $40 online.\nSmart Home Devices\nVoice-controlled smart devices like Google Nest or Alexa can simplify your life in multiple ways. You won\u2019t need to get up to turn on music, lights or the air conditioner, as you can simply speak your orders. They are also great for keeping track of things like scheduled events and medication reminders. Smart home devices vary in price by brand and complexity, from under $100 to hundreds of dollars. They often also require a small monthly subscription.\nMotion Light Sensor\nInstalling motion light sensors can help you avoid problems with seeing when you\u2019re active at night, as they turn on lights when they detect your movements. If you have poor balance, mobility or vision, this can be especially helpful. They can also save you the trouble of fumbling around in the dark looking for the light switch. Motion light sensors can cost as little as $15 or less.\nAutomatic Pill Dispenser\nIf you need to take several different medications, it can be confusing to keep track of them all. One solution is an automatic pill dispenser. You can program it to give you the right amount of pills at a set date and time. Many also have a built-in alarm that goes off to remind you when it\u2019s time to take the pill, and some even keep a record of missed or late doses. You can purchase an automatic pill dispenser online for around $60.\nKeyless Door Locks\nKeyless door locks make it easier to enter and exit your house quickly. These are touchscreen locks with codes, and some can even open through smartphone apps. Keyless door locks are excellent choices for people with arthritis or who frequently misplace keys. A keyless door lock goes for around $35 online.\nSmart Thermostats\nSmart thermostats can keep you comfortable at all times. They work by determining your habits and adjusting the temperatures in specific rooms or areas of your living quarters to maximize your comfort. At the same time, they turn off unnecessary operations to reduce energy use and save you money. These devices are available for just $80 online.\nSubscription Services\nFrom audiobooks to grocery delivery to music and movie streaming, signing up for subscription services makes retired life that much easier and more entertaining. Some can also help with your health. You can use them to order and receive prescriptions or improve your mental health through meditation and sleep subscription services. Subscription services\u2019 costs vary depending on the product or service being sold.\nGrip Socks\nShoes can be too clunky and uncomfortable to wear around the house, but wearing normal socks can increase the chance of falling. Investing in some pairs of grip socks is an excellent solution. These socks have tread patterns on the bottoms that act as grips. They protect against slippage and help with balance as you walk around indoors. You can find functional grip socks online for as little as $6."

      "text": "6 Low-Risk Accounts Financially Savvy People Trust for Reliable Returns \u2013 And How You Can Use Them\nNot everyone has the same risk appetite.

See how you can use them, too.\n1. Annuities\nAn annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company that promises you a future payout in regular installments, usually monthly and often for life. Annuities are a low-risk, long-term option financially savvy people use to ensure a reliable income during retirement.\nWith the Gainbridge\u00ae FastBreak\u2122 annuity, you\u2019ll earn up to APY**, which is more than 13 times the national average for a savings account.\nWhy It\u2019s Savvy:\n- Annuities offer guaranteed payments, which can be structured to last for a set number of years or for the rest of your life.\n- The Gainbridge\u00ae FastBreak\u2122 annuity pays you up to APY** on your investment.\n- Unlike traditional investments like stocks, annuities protect your capital from market volatility, making them a secure way to ensure long-term income.\nHow You Can Use It:\n- Consider annuities as part of your retirement planning, particularly if you\u2019re looking for a guaranteed income stream after you stop working.\n- Look for annuities that offer favorable interest rates and low fees.\nWant to start growing your money 13 times faster* than if you kept it in a savings account?

High-Yield Savings Accounts \u2014 Earn Up to 11x the National Average, Plus a $500 Bonus\nMost people have a savings account. But too many people keep their money in a savings account that isn\u2019t growing their money as fast as it could be. As of June 16, 2025, the national average interest rate on a savings account was just 0.38%.\nRaisin, a digital marketplace, makes it easy to find a high-yield savings account with an APY as high as 4.31% \u2014 more than 11 times the national average.\nWhy It\u2019s Savvy:\n- When you open an account and deposit funds, you can earn a welcome bonus of up to $500.

Invest in Real-Estate Loans \u2014 and Earn 8.1% in Dividends\nLoaning people money and charging interest is one of the ways large institutions and the ultra-wealthy earn passive income. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s typically available to the average person.\nBut with the Arrived Private Credit Fund, you can invest in a portfolio of real-estate loans that pay dividends monthly \u2014 with a historic yield of 8.10% annualized dividends.\nWhy It\u2019s Savvy:\n- Arrived is a platform backed by Jeff Bezos, Marc Benioff, and other top-tier investors, with more than 800,000 registered users and nearly $300 million invested.\n- This has historically yielded investors 8.10% annualized dividends.\nHow You Can Use It:\n- You\u2019ll invest in a diversified portfolio of loans across the U.S. that help fund renovations, rehabs, and new home construction.

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nQuestion #8 of GOBankingRates\u2019 Top 100 Money Experts Series\nWhat\u2019s the best way to save money on everyday purchases?\nMichelle Schroeder-Gardner knows something about making dramatic financial changes. The founder of Making Sense of Cents paid off nearly $40,000 in student loans in just seven months, then left her corporate job to travel full time in an RV and sailboat for nearly a decade. But her biggest money-saving insights don\u2019t come from major lifestyle overhauls. They come from small, everyday tweaks that most people overlook.\n\u201cOne of the best ways I\u2019ve found to save money on everyday purchases is by being intentional,\u201d Schroeder-Gardner shared. \u201cThat means making a list before you go to the grocery store, planning your meals to avoid food waste and comparing prices before buying.\u201d\nAfter more than 13 years of helping millions of readers through her award-winning blog, she\u2019s identified three key strategies that can help almost anyone save hundreds of dollars each month \u2014 without feeling deprived.\nSmall Changes, Big Impact\nWhen asked about everyday habits that created substantial savings, Schroeder-Gardner points to one game-changer: meal planning.\n\u201cMeal prepping and meal planning has easily saved us hundreds of dollars each month,\u201d she said. \u201cWe used to rely a lot on takeout or pre-packaged meals, especially on busy days, but the costs really added up.\u201d\nHer approach isn\u2019t about magically becoming a gourmet chef or spending hours in the kitchen. Instead, she focuses on simple systems: \u201cI batch cook some staples, freeze leftovers and always have a few \u2018lazy meals\u2019 ready for nights when we don\u2019t feel like cooking. It doesn\u2019t have to be complicated \u2014 just having a plan makes a big difference.\u201d\nThe results speak for themselves. \u201cWe\u2019ve easily saved over $300 a month by skipping convenience meals,\u201d Schroeder-Gardner said. For a family spending $400-500 monthly on food, that represents a 60% to 75% reduction in food costs just from planning ahead.\nHer secret? Treating meal planning like any other important task. \u201cOnce I started planning simple meals for the week and prepping ingredients ahead of time, our grocery spending dropped and we stopped wasting so much food.\u201d\nThe Invisible Money Drains\nWhile most people focus on obvious expenses like coffee or lunch out, Schroeder-Gardner warns about \u201cinvisible expenses\u201d that quietly drain budgets.\n\u201cSubscriptions are a big one,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget about the streaming service you signed up for during a free trial, or that annual renewal you didn\u2019t notice on your credit card.\u201d\nHer solution is refreshingly simple: monthly financial check-ins. \u201cI recommend going through your bank or credit card statements once a month and asking yourself: \u2018Did I actually use this?\u2019 If the answer is no, cancel it.\u201d\nBut the most costly invisible expense might surprise you: interest on debt. \u201cIf you\u2019re carrying a balance, it can eat away at your budget and cost a lot of money over time,\u201d Schroeder-Gardner said. While not exactly \u201cinvisible,\u201d debt interest often gets overlooked in monthly budgeting because it feels fixed \u2014 but addressing it can free up real money for other goals.\nWhen You Think You\u2019ve Cut Everything\nFor people who feel they\u2019ve already trimmed every possible expense, Schroeder-Gardner suggests looking beyond line-item cuts to bigger-picture strategies.\n\u201cIf you\u2019ve already cut the obvious stuff, I\u2019d look at the bigger-picture expenses,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you have a good budget in place? Are you meal planning to avoid food waste? Could you refinance a loan or negotiate a lower internet or phone bill?\u201d\nShe also recommends trying a \u201cno-spend challenge\u201d for a week or month. \u201cIt can reset your habits and help you see spending patterns you may have missed.\u201d\nAnd here\u2019s where Schroeder-Gardner\u2019s advice gets especially interesting: Sometimes the answer isn\u2019t cutting more \u2014 it\u2019s earning more.\n\u201cIf you feel like you have nothing to cut, then you may want to look into making more money,\u201d she said. \u201cBack when I was paying off my student loans, I cut my budget as much as I could, but then I realized that I had to find ways to make more money. I was able to pay off $40,000 in student loans in just 7 months \u2014 mainly with side hustle income.\u201d\nWhether it\u2019s positioning yourself for a promotion at work, freelancing in your spare time, or launching a small business, increasing your income can create the financial breathing room you\u2019ve been looking for.\nThe Technology Advantage\nSchroeder-Gardner also leverages technology to maximize savings with minimal effort. \u201cI like using cashback apps, grocery receipt scanning apps like Fetch Rewards and browser extensions to stack savings. These little steps don\u2019t take much time, but they can add up over the course of a month.\u201d\nThe key is stacking multiple small savings rather than relying on any single strategy. A cashback app might save $5, a browser extension another $10 and meal planning $300 \u2014 but together, they can create meaningful monthly savings.\nThe Mindset Shift\nPerhaps most importantly, Schroeder-Gardner emphasizes that sustainable money-saving starts with changing how you think about money.\n\u201cThe turning point for me was realizing that I didn\u2019t have to wait until retirement to live the life I truly wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter paying off my student loans, I left my 8-to-5 job, started working for myself, and spent around a decade traveling full-time by RV and sailboat \u2014 all while growing a business I loved.\u201d\nThis perspective shift \u2014 from restricting spending to being intentional about money \u2014 is what makes the difference between feeling deprived and feeling empowered.\nHer advice boils down to three core principles: Plan ahead (especially for food), audit your invisible expenses monthly, and don\u2019t be afraid to focus on earning more when cutting isn\u2019t enough. None of these require extreme lifestyle changes, but together, they can free up hundreds of dollars every month.\n\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t have to be complicated,\u201d Schroeder-Gardner said. \u201cJust being intentional and having a plan makes a big difference.\u201d\nFor someone who turned financial intentionality into a full-time RV lifestyle and a thriving business, that\u2019s advice worth taking seriously.\nThis article is part of GOBankingRates\u2019 Top 100 Money Experts series, where we spotlight expert answers to the biggest financial questions Americans are asking.

      "text": "7 Wealth-Building Shortcuts Proven To Add $1K to Your Wallet This Month\nIt goes without saying that you could use an extra $1,000 this month. Every month, really. Whether you\u2019re standing in the egg aisle watching prices climb or getting closer to a major savings goal, that money could make a real difference. But $1,000 is a large amount of money to make in such a short amount of time. How can you possibly do it?\nFortunately, it\u2019s easier than you might think. You can even make money playing games or exploring investment opportunities on your phone \u2014 things you do anyway. With some simple and fun tasks, you can create shortcuts that put more cash in your wallet each month.\n1. Use an Annuity to Earn Guaranteed Growth on Your Retirement Savings\nIf you want to build wealth, it\u2019s smart to start thinking about your long-term goals and how you can protect what you\u2019ve built against the unknown \u2014 like a stock market downturn tanking your 401(k) before retirement.\nThat\u2019s where an annuity can come in \u2014 they can provide a guaranteed stream of income during retirement at a fixed rate. No stock-market risk involved.\nYou can get started with a Gainbridge\u00ae FastBreak\u2122 annuity with a minimum investment of just $1,000. The more you invest, the higher rate you can earn \u2014 up to 5.80% APY**. The best part? There\u2019s no risk to your investment.\nFor context, 5.80% APY is more than 15 times* the average rate on a savings account. Plus, your principal amount is fully protected, unlike when you invest in the stock market.\nThe FastBreak\u2122 annuity is self-directed, easy to set up and comes with 30 days to cancel your contract if you change your mind. Plus you can access up to 10% of your money each year without penalties \u2014 even if you\u2019re under 59\u00bd.\nLooking for a predictable, stable way to grow your retirement savings without risking any of your principal investment? Get started here with as little as $1,000 to earn 5.50% APY, or deposit more to earn up to 5.80% APY.\n2. Grow Your Money More Than 10x Faster (And Earn Up to $500 as a Bonus)\nIf you\u2019re keeping your dough in a traditional checking account, you\u2019re not letting it rise to its full potential. You need an account that lets you earn competitive interest on your everyday balance.\nRaisin, a digital marketplace, makes it easy to find a high-yield savings account with an APY as high as 4.31% \u2014 that\u2019s more than 10 times the national average interest on a savings account, which pays just 0.38% APY as of June 16, 2025.\nPlus, when you open an account and deposit funds, you can earn a welcome bonus of up to $500. The more you deposit, the more you can earn.\nThere are no fees from Raisin, and they already have 1 million customers and a 4.5 star rating on Trustpilot.Want to start growing your money more than 11 times faster \u2014 and earn up to a $500 bonus? It only takes a few minutes to open an account.\n3. Stop Wasting $1,025 a Year on Car Insurance\nSometimes, the most effective way to save money is to stop spending it on overpriced services \u2014 like insurance that is far more expensive than it should be.\nOver time, those extra costs can add up to hundreds of dollars per year. To pump the brakes on this excess spending, use Insurify, a platform that lets you easily compare car insurance policies \u2014 and it can save you up to $1,025 a year.\nOn a single platform, you can browse insurance offerings from some of the most respected providers. After entering basic details about your needs, you\u2019ll receive customized quotes that you can review on your own time from the comfort of your own home.\nWant to add up to $1,025 back to your wallet this year? It\u2019s easy to get started here and see how much you can save.\n4. Earn Passive Real-Estate Income \u2014 With Just $1K\nOwning rental property has always been one of the most well-known ways to earn passive income. There\u2019s just one problem.

You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nLuxury vehicle buyers are about to witness some incredible deals as high-end SUVs face unprecedented depreciation challenges this summer.\nAccording to Lauren Fix, automotive expert at Car Coach Reports, many luxury SUVs will experience massive price drops due to delivery inventory issues, declining demand and elevated insurance rates. Summer 2025 represents an ideal window for purchasing these sophisticated vehicles as dealers become increasingly motivated to clear inventory.\nThe depreciation trends affecting luxury automotive brands stem from shifting consumer preferences, economic pressures and evolving market dynamics. Smart buyers who understand these patterns can capitalize on exceptional opportunities to own premium SUVs at a fraction of original prices.\nAlfa Romeo Stelvio\nThe Alfa Romeo Stelvio faces severe depreciation challenges as this Italian sports SUV struggles to maintain competitive positioning against rivals. According to CarEdge, the Stelvio depreciates approximately 67% after five years, resulting in a resale value of just $18,957.\nRecent auction results demonstrate the dramatic value decline, with a 2024 Stelvio Veloce selling for $32,500 after originally costing $53,120, per Carscope report.\nFix explained that Stellantis ownership has contributed to declining sales alongside concerns about average interior quality and reliability issues.\nThe Stelvio was designed for curvy roads but faces steep competition from established luxury brands offering superior value retention. Consumer awareness regarding high starting prices and questionable long-term reliability continues to impact demand significantly throughout American markets.\nJaguar F-Pace\nJaguar\u2019s F-Pace experiences substantial depreciation problems as the British luxury brand struggles with declining consumer interest and weak sales performance.\nThe F-Pace depreciates 57.7% after five years, resulting in a resale value of approximately $24,090 according to iSeeCars. Fix noted that Jaguar\u2019s recent commercial campaign for their all-electric vehicles has fallen flat with American consumers.\nThe brand\u2019s transition strategy has created confusion among buyers, leading to significant inventory accumulation and aggressive pricing incentives from dealers. Jaguar\u2019s historically weak resale values compound current market challenges, making the F-Pace particularly vulnerable to steep price reductions.\nDealers are offering substantial deals to move inventory as consumer attention shifts toward more reliable luxury alternatives.\nPorsche Macan\nThe Porsche Macan faces unique depreciation pressures following the brand\u2019s controversial decision to electrify their most popular SUV model completely. While the Macan typically depreciates 42.5% after five years \u2014 with better value retention than competitors \u2014 electric versions are struggling significantly, per iSeeCars.\nFix explained that Porsche\u2019s transition to all-electric Macan resulted in minimal sales, forcing the reintroduction of gas-powered variants.\nThe Macan handles like a true sports car, but electric vehicle sales have fallen flat among traditional Porsche enthusiasts. EV Macans are accumulating on dealer lots with prices dropping massively as consumer demand remains disappointingly low nationwide. This situation creates exceptional opportunities for buyers interested in electric luxury SUVs at substantially reduced prices."

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nIf your idea of the perfect retirement is to enjoy leisurely mornings, you\u2019ll need to start preparing ahead of time. Retirement planning starts while you\u2019re still working. No matter how old you are, now is the perfect time to create a savings plan to help you retire comfortably.\nTo ease the process of planning for retirement, it\u2019s a good idea to break it down into some basic steps. You\u2019ll start by creating a vision of your retirement lifestyle, helping turn it over the years as you build your savings. Let\u2019s dig into the need-to-know, essential details for proper retirement planning.\n1. Start Saving Now\nEven if you are fresh out of high school, it\u2019s never too early to start saving for retirement. A good first step is looking at the different savings plans available.\nOne option is to open a high-yield savings account dedicated to your retirement savings. Many Americans rely on company-sponsored 401(k) plans to build retirement savings. Other options include:\n- One-participant 401(k)s if you are a business owner with no employees\n- 403(b)s\n- Traditional individual retirement accounts (IRAs)\n- Roth IRAs\n- SIMPLE IRAs\n2. Contribute to Your Employer\u2019s Retirement Savings Plan\nIf your employer offers a 401(k) plan or other retirement plan, sign up and contribute. This is the best and easiest way to start building a retirement fund. When you use an employer-sponsored plan, your employer handles the heavy lifting. All you have to do is agree to have money deducted from your paycheck every pay cycle. You also get tax advantages. And if your employer matches your contribution, you get free money that goes into your retirement savings.\nIn 2025, employees can contribute up to $23,500 in their:\n- 401(k)\n- 403(b)\n- 457 plans\n- The federal government\u2019s Thrift Savings Plan\n3. Find Out About Your Employer\u2019s Pension Plan\nMany government employers offer a traditional pension plan rather than a 401(k) plan. If your employer offers a pension plan, find out if you\u2019re covered. You can ask for an individual benefit statement to understand your pension\u2019s value and ensure you know what\u2019s happening with your benefits before changing jobs.\n4. Invest In an IRA\nIf you don\u2019t have access to a 401(k) or pension plan, you should start investing in an IRA to build your nest egg. IRAs offer tax benefits that bolster your retirement savings over time. Even if you have a company-sponsored plan, invest in an IRA to save faster. Keep in mind that the maximum you can contribute to an IRA in 2025 is $7,000 a year.\nHowever, you get an additional \u201ccatch-up\u201d contribution of $1,000 to bring the total to $8,000 if you\u2019re 50 or older.\n5. Balance Your Portfolio\nSaving money for retirement is only part of your overall strategy. You also need to make sure your investments have the right mix of:\n- Stocks\n- Bonds\n- Mutual funds\n- ETFs\n- Real estate\n- Other assets\nSpreading your investments across diverse assets can mitigate risk and produce steady returns over time.\n6. Don\u2019t Touch Your Retirement Savings\nIt\u2019s important to never dip into these accounts unless you\u2019re facing a financial emergency. Taking loans and early withdrawals from your retirement savings can set your retirement plans back years. For example, if your 401(k) plan allows you to take a loan, you\u2019ll be required to repay it \u2014 including interest \u2014 according to strict terms. If you don\u2019t adhere to these requirements, any unpaid amounts will become a plan distribution.\nIn most cases, you\u2019ll have to include any previously untaxed amount of the distribution in your gross income the year the distribution occurred. You might also face an additional 10% tax on the amount of the taxable distribution.\n7. Set Retirement Goals\nOnce you have done the early planning, you should set a target age for retirement. Some people choose to continue working well into their 60s and 70s, especially if they enjoy your work. Others prefer to step out of the workforce to travel or spend time with loved ones while they are still in good health.\nYou\u2019ll also need to envision your ideal retirement lifestyle. Things to consider include:\n- Where you\u2019ll live\n- How much your lifestyle will cost\n- Whether you need to earn extra money through a part-time job or side gig\n8. Determine How Much Money You\u2019ll Need\nA big part of enjoying retirement is having enough money to live your ideal lifestyle. The U.S. Department of Labor recommends having 70% to 90% of your income to maintain your current standard of living. If you\u2019re currently earning $60,000 per year, you\u2019ll likely need $42,000 to $54,000 per year in retirement, or $3,500 to $4,500 per month.\nIf you think Social Security will cover most of this cost, you\u2019re probably mistaken. As of May 2025, the average Social Security retirement benefit was about $2,002 a month, according to the Social Security Administration. That\u2019s not nearly enough to cover the average living costs in the United States.\nTo help you formulate a good savings goal, look at the retirement calculator from GOBankingRates. You can use it to determine how much you might need to save for retirement. To figure out the right amount, it will use factors such as:\n- Retirement age\n- Savings\n- Income\n9. Familiarize Yourself With Social Security Benefits\nYou can start claiming Social Security benefits as early as age 62. However, delaying your claim can increase your monthly payments. The full retirement age is when you qualify for full benefits. That\u2019s considered 66 or 67 depending on when you were born.\nAfter age 70, there\u2019s no financial benefit to delaying further. To be eligible for Social Security retirement benefits, you need a minimum of 10 years of work, equivalent to 40 credits. Your benefit amount is calculated based on your 35 highest-earning years.\n10. Hire a Professional\nPlanning for retirement is not just about setting aside money for the future. You should develop an investment strategy that maximizes your returns and helps build an adequate nest egg for your golden years. This involves:\n- Understanding different investments\n- Managing risk\n- Planning for a long retirement to ensure you don\u2019t run out of money\n- Learning the tax laws and how best to navigate them\nIf you have the resources, you should hire a financial advisor. They can help you put together the best plan for your personal financial situation and retirement goals.\nWhat Should I Do 5 Years Before Retirement?\nIf you\u2019re retirement planning for the next five years, you\u2019re probably getting excited for this new chapter. Many of the decisions you make now can have a lasting impact on your retirement lifestyle. This period and the first five years after retirement are known as the fragile decade.\nYou want to ensure you\u2019re taking the right steps now to ensure a smooth financial transition into your golden years. Some actions to take include:\n- Maximize all of your retirement accounts if you can do so.\n- Take a close look at your current budget. Pay down as much debt as possible.\n- Consider purchasing supplemental coverage to assist with medical costs.\n- If you haven\u2019t already, reach out to a fee-only financial planner to make sure your investment plan is on track.\n- Decide exactly where you\u2019ll live and use this to determine your estimated cost of living.\n- Take a closer look at your estimated Social Security monthly benefit.\n- If you don\u2019t already, make sure you have an emergency fund in place, so you don\u2019t have to take extra money out of a taxable retirement fund or get a job if you\u2019re faced with an unexpected major expense.\nFinal Take To GO\nIt\u2019s never too early or too late to start planning for retirement. The more time you spend thinking about the kind of life you want and taking steps to prepare for it now, the more likely you are to enjoy your golden years.\nEven if retirement is a long way away, today\u2019s actions will hugely impact your future. Opening a retirement savings account and contributing a portion of each paycheck might mean you have to sacrifice a bit now, but that\u2019s nothing compared to the amount you\u2019ll have to stretch your budget in retirement without proper savings.\nAllison Hache and Jennifer Taylor contributed to the reporting for this article."

That said, many don\u2019t know just how much you should save \u2014 and when you should begin saving \u2014 to guarantee yourself a comfortable retirement.\nRecently, GOBankingRates analyzed America\u2019s 50 most livable cities (per AreaVibes) in order to find the most suitable locales for an enjoyable retirement. From that list of cities, GOBankingRates the calculated such factors as overall expenses, population numbers and home values to determine the annual cost of living for each city. Using that annual cost of living and multiplying it by a factor of 20 to estimate the cost of a two-decade retirement for each city, GOBankingRates was then able to calculate just how much you would need to accrue monthly starting at the age of 25, 30 or 40 in order to have a comfortable retirement in each of America\u2019s 50 most livable cities.\nAlso see the cost of living comfortably in America\u2019s 50 largest cities.\n1.

Data was sourced from the U.S. Census American Community Survey, Sperling\u2019s BestPlaces, the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey, Zillow Home Value Index for April 2025 and the Federal Reserve Economic Data. Using the 50/30/20 finance rule that states that needs should not exceed 50% of household income, the total cost of retirement was doubled to find the comfortable cost of retirement. Assuming someone retires at 65, 20 years of retirement was calculated. The monthly savings you need to afford a comfortable retirement in the highest livable cities was calculated assuming you started saving at 22, 25, 30, and 40 years old. The cities were sorted by their livability index, showcasing the cost of retirement in the highest livable cities. All data was collected on and is up to date as of June 13, 2025.\nShare This Article:\nYou May Also Like\n- How Long Will My Money Last?\n- How Much Do You Need To Retire?\n- How To Prepare For Retirement\n- How To Save For Retirement Without A 401K\nLearn More About Early Retirement Planning\nMake your money work for you\nGet the latest news on investing, money, and more with our free newsletter.\nThanks!\nSending you timely financial stories that you can bank on.\nSign up for our daily newsletter for the latest financial news and trending topics.\nFor our full Privacy Policy, click here.\nLooks like you're using an adblocker\nPlease disable your adblocker to enjoy the optimal web experience and access the quality content you appreciate from GOBankingRates.\n- AdBlock / uBlock / Brave\n- Click the ad blocker extension icon to the right of the address bar\n- Disable on this site\n- Refresh the page\n- Firefox / Edge / DuckDuckGo\n- Click on the icon to the left of the address bar\n- Disable Tracking Protection\n- Refresh the page\n- Ghostery\n- Click the blue ghost icon to the right of the address bar\n- Disable Ad-Blocking, Anti-Tracking, and Never-Consent\n- Refresh the page"

According to a CNET survey, the average U.S. adult spends $91 a month on subscriptions and 48% of those surveyed revealed they\u2019re paying for a service they forgot to cancel after the free trial.\nWhile there are costly subscriptions that eat too much into your budget, there are actually some that are worth the monthly $20 fee or less.\nGoogle Photos\n- Price: Starting at $1.99 a month\nGoogle Photos is free, but if you want extra storage, you\u2019ll have to pay for it. However, with plans starting at just $1.99 a month, the app can be an affordable way to not worry about keeping too many pics, easy sharing and access to photo editing tools.\nMealime App\n- Price: $2.99 a month\nNobody likes to come home from a busy day and have to figure out dinner, but mealime makes meal prepping effortless. The app saves you time and money by simplifying every meal from the ingredients needed to prep and cook time.\nDisney + and Hulu\n- Price: $10.99 a month with ads\nWith so many streaming services, it\u2019s tough to narrow down what to pay for and what to skip, but if you\u2019re looking for family-friendly content or love Marvel, Disney + is a great option. It\u2019s bundled with Hulu, but you can also add on Max for an extra $6.99 a month.\nXbox Game Pass\n- Price: $11.99 to $19.99 a month depending on package\nA subscription to Xbox Game Pass allows users to access hundreds of high-quality games that are accessible on several devices such as a PC and console. Subscribers can enjoy an unlimited and wide-ranging variety of multiplayer games with family, friends or others online.\nAmazon Prime\n- Price: $14.99 a month\nFor those who shop on Amazon often and love scoring major discounts on Prime Days, Amazon Prime has enough benefits to warrant the monthly cost or annual total of $139, $69 a year for students.\nPerks include:\n- Free two-day shipping\n- Unlimited TV and movie streaming\n- Grubhub+ is free for Prime members (the cost is typically $9.99 a month)\n- Exclusive sales\n- Unlimited music streaming\nMonthly subscriptions can rack up easily, but pulling the plug on ones you don\u2019t use could save you hundreds a year.\nEditor\u2019s note: Pricing is accurate as of Feb. 7, 2024. Prices are subject to change."

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nThere are a few critical expenses that are often inevitable in retirement, and it\u2019s likely that many boomers didn\u2019t plan for them accordingly. These expenses are now coming back to bite them.\nWhat are they, and how can succeeding generations avoid these often innocent mistakes?\nLong-Term Care Planning\nPatrice Williams-Lindo, CEO of Career Nomad, saw just how painfully pricey long-term care for seniors can be while helping both her parents and in-laws navigate aging, illness and end-of-life care.\n\u201cI can tell you firsthand: the costs boomers didn\u2019t plan for aren\u2019t just financial \u2014 they\u2019re emotional, generational and systemic,\u201d Williams-Lindo said. \u201cMy family was quoted over $6,000/month for quality assisted living in Georgia. Multiply that over a few years and you\u2019re talking hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2014 money most didn\u2019t save because they assumed retirement meant rest; not round-the-clock care.\u201d\nMany financial experts, including Jay Zigmont, PhD, MBA, CFP, founder and CEO of Childfree Wealth, agreed with Williams-Lindo that lack of long-term care planning among boomers \u2014 and younger generations \u2014 is among the worst and costliest mistakes.\n\u201cA year in a skilled nursing facility runs $115k, on average. Men will spend 2.2 years in care, and women 3.7,\u201d Zigmont said. \u201cWithout a plan to pay for long-term care, the first person that needs care may cause their spouse to go broke.\u201d\nLong-term care, whether you pay out of pocket or with a long-term care insurance policy, is incredibly expensive, so it makes sense that so many boomers didn\u2019t bother.\n\u201cFor a couple that wants to pay out of pocket, I recommend setting aside $500k now,\u201d Zigmont said. \u201cIf you are single, you also need to set aside $500k. That may not make sense on the surface, but with a couple, your spouse often provides care for some time, making the total cost lower.\u201d\nInflation\nA common unplanned for expense that Frederick Saide, managing partner at MoneyMattersUSA, Advisory LLC often sees coming back to haunt boomers is inflation.\n\u201cI often get the response, \u2018That\u2019s not my problem,'\u201d Saide told GOBankingRates. \u201cThe assumption is retirement will not last all that long \u2014 certainly not 30 or more years \u2014 so \u2018I won\u2019t have to go through the inflation cycle three or four times\u2019 is the mindset.\u201d\nTo guide clients, Saide uses the Society of Actuaries and the American Academy of Actuaries calculator on longevity to help establish both individual and joint life expectancies.\n\u201cWhat I want is an agreement on the time horizon to plan for; otherwise, we won\u2019t have a clear direction on how much money is needed to last, and what the client wants their money to achieve for them,\u201d Saide. \u201cThis process is the reality check moment when I show from 2002 to 2023 inflation averaged 5.5%, nearly double the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\u201d\nSocial Security and Pension Tax Burdens\nMany boomers made the mistake of not looking too deeply into the fine print of Social Security and required minimum distributions (RMDs). Specifically, they didn\u2019t study the tax aspect.\n\u201cUp to 85% of Social Security benefits can be taxed, and RMDs can nudge retirees into higher tax brackets, triggering Medicare surcharges,\u201d said Andrew Latham, CFP, content director at Supermoney.com. \u201cRoth conversions in your 60s can help, but many wait too long.\u201d\nEstate Plan Updates\nDid you make a will in your 40s and not update it to reflect your needs and wants in your 60s? A lot of boomers make that mistake.\n\u201cMany times, people adopt a \u2018set it and forget it\u2019 mentality when it comes to estate planning,\u201d said Charles Nemes, co-founder and CEO at Nemes Rush Family Wealth Management. \u201cThis can lead to significant damage to the relationships beneficiaries enjoy today, and potentially put money into their hands when it could actually hurt them more than help them. Unfortunately, estate plans seldom reflect the current feelings of those who drafted them years ago because so many things could have changed. For example, a beneficiary may have issues with drugs/gambling/alcohol, or is getting divorced, has a child with special needs, is getting sued, or is in a high-risk profession.\u201d\nNemes recommended reviewing your estate plan at least every five years to be sure it clearly reflects your current knowledge and feelings about each beneficiary."

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nYou\u2019ve done it. Somehow, in this economy, you have saved enough to retire and take the world\u2019s longest coffee break. In other words, goodbye tension and hello pension.\nIf you\u2019re a proud part of the baby boomer generation, born from 1946 to 1964, you have started reaching retirement age in mass. Like the silent generation before you, you are likely in a better financial position to retire comfortably than later generations, but that doesn\u2019t mean you no longer have to spend wisely.\nWith that in mind, here are the top five things boomers should always buy in retirement \u2014 even if they don\u2019t want to.\nNo. 5: Tech Devices Your Grandkid Can Easily Explain\nIt\u2019s not just your phone being weird or big tech companies out to get you. You can take one small step for mankind \u2014 and your family \u2014 and start investing in better technology to make your day-to-day life a bit easier for you and everyone you\u2019re trying to call.\nAccording to Dennis Shirshikov, a professor at the City University of New York specializing in finance, economics and accounting, \u201cInvesting in current technology \u2014 like smartphones, tablets or emergency alert systems \u2014 can enhance daily life, maintain social connections and ensure quick access to emergency services.\u201d\nJust make sure you have a tech-savvy grandkid around to help you set it up properly.\nNo. 4: Don\u2019t Screw Around \u2014 Pay for Small Home Repairs Now\nHome modifications are annoying but necessary when it comes to living out your golden years. In the hierarchy of needs, shelter is an important tier, so think of property maintenance as your house going to the gym to stay in shape.\n\u201cAs mobility becomes limited, investing in home modifications can significantly improve quality of life and independence,\u201d Shirshikov pointed out. \u201cItems like stairlifts, walk-in tubs and ramps are not just conveniences; they are essential for safe aging in place.\u201d\nNo. 3: Retirement Is Short, Buy a Faster Car\nTime is of the essence, so invest in a car that goes the speed and distance you need. Everyone else can either wait or try to keep up.\n\u201cFor those who continue to drive, vehicle adaptations such as pedal extenders, seat cushioning or hand controls can be essential for maintaining independence and safety on the road,\u201d Shirshikov explained.\nNo. 2: A Financial Advisor To Make Things Someone Else\u2019s Problem\nYou have an emergency fund for a reason, and that\u2019s to have cash for when the unexpected happens. Whether it\u2019s a medical bill or tattoo removal, you need a little cushion so you don\u2019t have to dip into your retirement savings. Likewise, you should have someone to help you wisely manage that savings.\n\u201cRegular consultations with financial advisors and legal experts can help boomers navigate the complexities of estate planning, tax strategies and retirement savings management,\u201d Shirshikov said.\nRemember, retirement means you\u2019re done working, so let a financial expert do a lot of your money work.\nNo. 1: Better Insurance, as You\u2019ll Never Get Out of Retirement Alive\nAnd the number one thing boomers should begrudgingly buy in retirement is \u2026 peace of mind (and life insurance)!\nBoomers are coming to terms with focusing more on health and healthcare costs, which is no light financial undertaking in this day and age. To throw an even more fun statistic out, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 70% of people over the age of 65 will need some form of long-term care in their lifetime, so make sure you set yourself and your family up for success.\n\u201cAs health needs increase with age, having robust health insurance becomes indispensable,\u201d Shirshikov said. \u201cThis goes beyond basic Medicare; supplemental plans that cover additional expenses such as prescriptions, dental, and vision care can significantly decrease potential out-of-pocket health costs.\u201d\nJ. Arky contributed to the reporting for this article."
